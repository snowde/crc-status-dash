625,Jenny H.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,1,,1.0,2012-01-07,"I really wish Yelp would allow zero stars, or at least half a star. This place needs to be shut down to allow for a decent restaurant  to open in its place. I normally don't bother writing reviews, but this place got me so mad, I couldn't just sit by and do nothing. I've been here with friends a few times and the food is hit or miss. Strangely enough, the faster the food comes out, the better it is. I guess they fail when they take forever to cook here. The service is a different story. Each time I've been here, the service has consistantly gotten worse. My boyfriend and I sat at the bar this time, and were promptly and continually ignored until we finally left. We were going to have dinner, but left after we finished our appetizers. The guy at the bar just stayed down at the end of the bar and chatted with all of the other employees when they came by to pick up drinks for their customers. The whole restaurant was pretty slow, so there wasn't any reason for the service to be so slow. We should have left after it took between 5 or 10 minutes for the bartender to take our drink order from 10 feet away. I guess that's our fault. Then it took fifteen minutes for him to bother checking to see if we wanted to order food. We order 2 appetizers that were just OK. It was at that point that we decided to throw in the towel, and go eat somewhere else. Before we left we politely asked where the restrooms were. Without even looking up from his cell phone, he pointed off into nowhere and shouted ""around the corner"".  We asked the girl at the front desk if the bartender was new, but to our surprise, she said he was the head bartender and had been there longer than anyone else! I guess he's past his prime, and needs to go find a new job. I just hope he doesn't go work anyplace we will be dining in the future, because it sure won't be here again. Gook luck to anyone thinking about eating here, hope you catch them on a good night. If you do, you might actually have a decent experience.

I never had Gumbo before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. The soup base is amazingly good. Mouthwatering really. We split the dish and they gave us an extra plate :) They did not charge a $12 splitting fee..

Our waiter (whose name I do not remember) was really helpful. He got our order right, made sure our drinks were always filled and was available if we needed anything.

339,Fred T.,"Palo Alto, CA",454,285,1832.0,2.0,2012-01-16,"Ah the Cheesecake factory. Ive always thought of them as a solid 3-4 star kind of place. Its kind of like going to PF Chang's: You have a general idea of what you are going to get no matter where you happen to be and they have such a huge menu that you can cover even picky eaters (more on that in a bit), and they do vary a bit from place to place but don't really stray too far from the baseline.  That being said the last two times here we have come away very unhappy with the food. As always the service is great and the atmosphere / acoustics are fantastic for a chain restaurant, but their expansive menu seems to be having a negative impact on quality and whoever is running the pass is not paying attention to the details. Todays late lunch was a case in point:  The Apps:  Buffalo Blasts: A must order IMHO. Crispy deep fried wontons filled with shredded buffalo chicken are to die for. Not today. They verged on the overcooked and at least 3 were not sealed so the filling was greasy and overcooked. That however was only the beginning.  Thai Chicken Wraps: Another must order for us. Sometimes my wife will get this as her main. The build your own platter is tasty and fun. However, today it looks like we got the lettuce discards with nice large brown slimy areas on the stems. They were replaced quickly but come on.  Mains:  Hickory Burger: Not cooked as I ordered it. There is a big difference between the rare I asked for and Medium well. Also the onion rings were absent. I mentioned the missing items and it was fixed quickly. I did not bother asking the burger to be redone. After tasting the meat, perhaps it was for the best as it had an off taste. I expect better quality meat at this range of restaurant. The top fries were pretty good but the ones in the bottom were undercooked and had that greasy translucent look to them.  Salmon: Salmon was a generous portion and properly cooked. It was off the lunch menu and was a pretty good deal.  Kids Chicken Tenders: Batter dipped and looked really good. BUT, if you are going to pre-fill the cup the ranch goes it, give it a stir so you customers don't notice the brownish skin that has developed over the little cup. Better yet lets say you fill it to order.  Heck no we did not want desert.  All and all its been back to back issues here. None of these items is a big deal but coupled together its a big issue. Also after the lettuce issue I would expect the dishes comming out to get closer scrutiny. As I said I think the menu is simply too big for any kitchen to keep tabs and quality control is a must. It kills these places long term. I for one will not be back anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=340,2.72,3.01,3.076,2.536,2.8939999999999997

540,Shelly T.,"San Francisco, CA",24,89,84.0,4.0,2012-01-24,"I've only ever gotten cheesecake to go here, so I'll let my review speak just for that. One great thing about the Cheesecake Factory is that they have tons and tons of, well, cheesecake. It's not something I can eat every week (although I can't lie, I really want to), but on special occasions I'll drop in and nab a slice.  The first time I came here with a friend, we wanted to sit at a table and catch up over some dessert, but we were told only restaurant patrons could sit inside. Bummer! I'd rather have gone to a cafe and gotten a pastry, but we'd already picked what flavor cheesecake to get (an agonizingly slow and painstaking process). The other couple times I've always gotten either the turtle pecan cheesecake (so good for you pecan and chocolate lovers out there!) and the coconut cheesecake for the coconut enamored bf. I love that they give scrumptious cheesecake with a fat dollop of calorific whipped cream for that extra sugar rush that I love. Sometimes you have to very expressly get the attention of someone at the register to let them know you want a slice to go since they're often busy with long lines of people. It gets packed so come early to get dessert before dinner!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=480,2.8,3.01,3.084,2.8000000000000003,2.9259999999999997
885,Michelle N.,"Menlo Park, CA",4,34,3.0,2.0,2012-01-28,The food is standard Cheesecake Factory food but the service is absolutely horrible.  We asked for water 4 times throughout our meal and got it right before we got our check.  We also only had 4 place settings so we asked twice for 2 more settings.  We got them after our meals were delivered.  The server dropped a knife on the ground and never brought another knife back so we had to share a knife between two people.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=860,2.76,2.99,3.088,2.6000000000000005,2.8979999999999997
549,Matt V.,"Sunnyvale, CA",672,313,59.0,3.0,2012-01-29,"I've been here a few times, and there's not much that sets it apart from other Cheesecake Factories. The ambiance inside the restaurant is decadent. There are high ceilings and swanky decor bathed in yellow lights. Large pillars run from the floor to the ceiling; it feels very fancy. The restaurant is usually very crowded, and there's a lot of noise from all the patrons in the restaurant. Hard to get seated immediately unless you have a reservation. Service is okay, although there will be stretches of time when you don't see your server at all, even if your glass of water or basket of bread is empty. This is probably because there are so many patrons in the restaurant, all of whom keep the servers quite busy. The food is decent enough; I like the Cashew Chicken, especially, which is a nice spicy dish served with green onions and roasted cashews. The menu claims that it's a Mandarin dish, but I doubt that. Honestly, I doubt that it was even inspired by a Mandarin dish! Hard to avoid the cheesecake at the end of the meal, too! I think my favorite is the Oreo cookie cheesecake! Definitely puts a good end to the meal! Overall, Cheesecake Factory is a chain, and isn't anything too special. There are some items on their menus that I like well enough, but there are also a lot of items on the menu that I meet with a resounding ""meh.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=480,2.72,2.97,3.088,2.732,2.87

Party of nine, was asked to wait for 30 minutes eventhough there's plenty of open seats and there's no one else waiting. After ten minutes they call us to say our table's ready. Ten minutes to wait for the server. Server comes in and takes our order, ten minutes to bring back our drinks. Five minutes to bring back some bread. Twenty minutes to get our food on the table. Total time wasted? over 40 minutes thus far. Ordered some usual favorites on the menu, only to find out they were not available. Kids grilled chicken with mashed potato were super dry.

Cheesecake was as good as ever but $7.95 -  a bit overpriced in my book.

I've also always been a fan of their pastas-- I'm pretty sure I've tried almost every single one on the menu-- and have never been disappointed. I tried the cajun jambalaya pasta on a whim once, but it is so good! And when they say SPICY, they're not lying.

526,Mark M.,"Mountain View, CA",70,19,,5.0,2012-05-20,"We went to Cheesecake tonight for my Mom's birthday. The group was me, my wife, my Mom, my almost-3 year old son, and our newborn in a stroller. We haven't eaten at this location before. We arrived around 6:20 for dinner on a Sunday night and were promptly seated. After taking our order, our server -- unprompted -- brought out a special plate of bread and sliced bananas for our almost-3 year old to munch on. Outstanding! The bread, especially the dark break, is, as always, delicious and easy to fill up on before your main course. We were saving room for dessert so skipped any appetizers. For dinner, my wife, mom and I all had combination plates with the Steak Diane and seafood. My wife and mom had Shrimp Scampi, I had herb crusted salmon with a white wine sauce. We all really enjoyed the steak -- which was wonderfully moist and tender, and the sweet wine sauce with mushrooms really were fantastic. My salmon was delicious and perfectly cooked, and we all remarked that the mashed potatoes were superb. My son enjoyed his chicken fingers, which were crisp but not greasy and made with high quality white meat. He enjoyed the ranch and the honey mustard sauce. The sliced fruit that accompanied it was a fresh and delicious mix of apples, pineapple, pear, orange, and strawberry. For dessert, my mom and wife said were the best Tiramisu they'd ever enjoyed (and we've had some pretty good ones in Tuscany a few years ago). Perfectly balanced flavors and sponginess. We also shared a slice of the chocolate truffle cake, which was really amazing. The chocolate was dark enough to satisfy me (I love dark chocolate) but not so dark as to shock my wife's palate, and it somehow managed to stay perfectly rich but not overpowering. The ice cream and whipped cream that came with it helped take just enough of the edge off. My son even had a few bites and didn't find it overpowering. Quite remarkable that we were all delighted by the dessert, even though we have slightly different palates. Also, a special thank you to the staff who when told we were there for my Mom's birthday brought the Tiramisu out with a candle and a special Happy birthday message, then they proceeded to serenade her with a Happy Birthday song. Thank you! The grand ceilings and decor made this a really fun special occasion restaurant. The service was efficient, kept our water cups and bread basket full, and was fast with the dessert delivery and the check. The price/value was excellent, considering the quality and quantity of the food we enjoyed.  We haven't been in a while. But this experience ensured that we'll be going back again before too long! The menu is huge and we were really impressed with the quality of the food. We'll definitely be back to explore it further.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=520,3.04,2.88,3.128,2.676,2.9440000000000004

I dare never touch my feet into this dump ever again! why I dare write a review for this place? why i dare even rate this as a one when it deserves to be gone? Thats a mystery to me too. Anyway let me tell you MY experience here..... Went here for dinner during the day of the eclipse, and as I walk into the restaurant with my family, I immediately walk up to the front desk. I stand there waiting for the greeter to finish taking her drink. I then proceeded to state my name. It takes her and 2 other waiters to find my name. This shows me that these employees are not the brightest leaf in the batch...either that or they have had one to many drinks that day. My name is finally found, and I walk to my seat. With a miracle, I somehow get a decent waitress! She asked my group how we were doing, and where we could find her if we needed her just in case. Every time I thanked her, she replied with a thank you back. This was the only good part of the night. I look at the menu, and I am struck with many kinds of heavy foods. Not that this is a problem or anything, (oh wait it is) its just that what would people who aren't looking for a heavy meal to eat? Even the portions on the salads are enough to sustain 2-3 people! Knowing from prior knowledge of eating at other factories closer to my home, I immediately knew where to look for a good dish.  I ended up getting their so called ""award winning"" famous portabella mushroom burger. And heres where the night drops..... Now, the rest of my family ordered other horrible and fattening foods, but none were as DISGUSTING, as this!  The hamburger was made from a gray garbage or also known as left over meat that was thrown into a food processor, pureed to a thin pulp, and formed into a patty. And to add insult to failure, the cook had made my well-done patty into a rare piece of crap!  I had NOT told the waitress about this horrible experience here, because I knew that ordering here again would be a vile mistake, and I didn't want her to be hurt if this were her favorite dish. Moreover, I also didn't want my family to get involved into something that only I was completely concerned about.  P.S.* It doesn't take a cook like me, to notice that a well done hamburger should be on the grill for more than just a quick 3 minutes! Also, if you are going to serve your crap from the counter to a guest? Next time make sure they like to eat crap. Because I sure don't. Ever.

We'd casually talked about going out for dinner somewhere, but both of us are such homebodies, and I was so into my photo editing that he finally got tired of waiting for me and ate a slice of pizza.  Well, around 9:30 I was finally done with my photos (for the day) and felt like we should do SOMETHING... but what can you do in Redwood City at 9:30? (If you live in Redwood City like we do, you know... there's almost nothing to do after 8:00... everything closes so early here!). I wasn't super hungry, but thought maybe we could go to Ihop or Denny's for dessert.  But... the thought of one of their microwaved pies or slices of cake to celebrate 3 years of marriage just didn't seem all that appealing.  On a whim I decided to see how late the Cheesecake factory is open. I used to work down the street and occasionally we'd pick up lunches from here (their luau salad is amazing). Lo and behold, I could not believe they are actually open till ELEVEN on Sunday nights! Bingo!! So we got there around 10, and had the most awesome, decadent chocolate fudge cake and coffee ice cream thing ever.  Our waiter, Will, was also very nice.

547,Hany P.,"Melbourne, Australia",14,14,5.0,4.0,2012-11-06,"I was heading back to San Jose from Redwood City and the traffic on the freeway was  ridiculous. Decided to stop off for dinner at The Cheesecake Factory, which immediately springs to mind as a dinner destination... kind of like how you go to the Pancake Parlour for their steaks. As far as first impressions go, I have to say this place was outstanding. High ceilings, tastefully fitted out, slightly dimmed mood lighting and jazzy music that was loud enough to add ambience and not too loud as to overpower conversations. All of this made for the perfect setting to take a beautiful dinner companion. On to the food - the menu is extensive which does me no good at all as I have an incredibly hard time deciding. I settled on the Chicken Madeira which had mushrooms, mash and asparagus in a wine sauce and ordered some fried calamari as an entree. I probably spoiled my appetite by eating the calamari as the servings here are quite large even for an entree, but my general impression was that the food was tasty but heavy as the traffic on 101-South after work... My fiancee had a salmon salad which when I tasted it, it was cold but I believe that's how it was supposed to come out. I usually don't care much for salads at all so I won't comment but she said that ""I would usually give it a 4, but for what I wanted to eat tonight, this is a 5"". Overall, an enjoyable experience but certainly not a 5. It takes a lot for me to give a 5-star rating and this place was let down by a few things: - the bill came to me whilst I was in the middle of eating my main which is something I absolutely hate - I think I found a hair in my garlic aioli calamari dip. Normally this is grounds for an instant one-star but I'll let this one slide because I'm not sure if it was my own hair... - the service I was merely okay. Don't get me wrong, everything came out promptly (including the bill), but to get a 5, I need the waiters to engage in some humourous banter! Didn't get a chance to try the cheesecake; I generally don't like cheesecake anyway because I find it quite sour on my palette.

At this point I should mention that the waiter, though friendly enough, seemed kind of out of it... we both thought maybe he was stoned or perhaps been out all night previous... or both. My partner's drink arrived in about 5 minutes. After another 10 minutes a different (waitress) arrived and asked if she could take our drink orders. I told her that I had ordered a raspberry lemonade from the first waiter but it hadn't arrived yet. Then she took our lunch orders and said that she would check on my drink. My raspberry lemonade arrived fairly quickly, but after yet another 20 minutes or so, another waitress arrived at our table and asked if she could take our lunch order. We told her that we had already ordered about 20 minutes earlier from a different waitress; she then said that she would check inside. This is the last we saw of any of these 3 servers. Meanwhile we waited another 15-20 minutes at which time we asked a fourth employee (who was clearing a table nearby) to check on our food as we now had been sitting at our outside table for a good 45 minutes; we also asked her to bring the manager. A few minutes later, the manager arrived (don't recall his name, but was a friendly, youngish Asian)... he seemed genuinely apologetic about it all, and in fact offered us our lunch on the house.

I worked in the service industry and to have the entire staff to act like we were keeping them from doing nothing was ridiculous. So, from their beginning we had our reservations messed up. We had reservations at 6:30 and they got pushed back because tables that already paid for their bill and were sitting no longer ordering. Then being told that we can't get a table together because of this. We didn't get sat until 8pm and then it was squeezing 11 people into a booth at the bar. The hostess told us that this was better than nothing. Nothing? Remember we had reservations. To the so called manager coming to tell us at the beginning they messed up and would make it up. Then the bus boy setting down all the table settings on the table in one pile. Oh we can set that up as customers I guess. Then the birthday girls cheesecake came right at the beginning of dinner. Finally at the end of dinner after a second complaint three manager decided to do something nice for us. He took off the $13.95 salad and birthday cheesecake for just the birthday girl. Nevermind the rest of us. Then after a third complaint to another manager, he offered to give the birthday girl and her boyfriend a free dinner. Once again nothing for the rest of the party who had kids and needed to get home because they had not planned to spend almost 4 hours for dinner.

Ok, FIVE STARS definitely for their CHEESECAKES!!! as I never had any cheesecake that I don't like from the Cheesecake Factory :). Came here last night with 25+ people for a birthday celebration. The servers were super nice and very accommodating. I never wait tables BUT I'm sure it was quite a challenge to serve such a large group!  We got two servers but the male server (don't know his name) who was in charge of my section was SUPER NICE and ATTENTIVE. He's either a latino or filipino (dark hair, dark skin) wearing glasses. I ordered my water with no ice and when the water arrived it had ice in it. I didn't want to make a fuss about it and didn't complain but when he noticed my water with ice, he quickly said, ""let me grab a new glass of water with no ice in it."" WOW, with such a crowd, I must say that I was impressed that he remembered! I was trying to be ""good"" so that I would feel less guilty devouring on cheesecake for dessert so I opted for the Mexican Lettuce Wrap from the Skinnilicious menu (less than 490 calories). I must say that I was very impress with the freshness and the flavor. $6.96 for three fairly large lettuce wraps with large (generous size) chunks of chicken, avocado, tomatoes and other fixings. The chicken was flavorful and seasoned well. The tomatoes and avocado added moisture to the white chicken pieces so they didn't feel too dry (the common issue of white meat!). I must say that for a person with a LARGE stomach, the portion was pretty good to fill me up despite the no-carb on the plate. I did devour three slices of the ""free"" bread with butter before hand though, so maybe that helped ahhahahahaha!!! For dessert, I opted for the 30th Anniversary Cheesecake and I was EXTREMELY HAPPY with my choice! The cheesecake was delicious!!! It wasn't too sweet but yet rich and creamy, the way $7.95/slice should be huahauhauhauh! The edges of the cheesecake had crunchy chocolate chunks that added that extra texture, yummmmmm!!! I licked my plate clean, literally!!!!! and yes, I finished the whole piece by myself (well a couple of my friends sampled my piece but I also sampled theirs, so I think it evens out!). The best thing of all was that the whole meal (my portion) including tax and gratuity was $20 which is nearly unheard of when dining with a large crowd in a nice restaurant in downtown PA! Another gf  (she didn't have cheesecake), only spent less than $15!!! wow!

We got our appetizer and drinks in a timely manner but after that we were lost as to what was happening. 30 mins passed, no entrees in sight. Our waiter checked back on us and he was surprised that we didn't have our food. He went to check what happened and told us we would get our food shortly.  We asked another waiter after waiting another 5 mins, serving the table next to us if he could check how much longer we would have to wait.

That being said, I thought about how I would rate this place had it been called something else and that's how I'm writing my review. The food here varies in quality by what you order. Pasta, of course, always comes in large portions here though the quality is just okay. I feel the pizza is the best thing to order at Cheesecake Factory and I have never been let down by it. My friend got the Steak Diane and it might have been the most delicious thing on that table. I came close to closing time and the service was amazing. The waiter was very attentive and didn't try to rush out my large group when it was closing time. The ambiance is really nice and this one has beautiful decorations though I feel is was a little too dimly lit for people to be able to tell. I had trouble reading my menu. That means it was too dark. Cheesecake gets its own category because, duh, that's why I came. I got the Oreo Cheesecake and it might be the better than the Godiva one! All-in-all Cheesecake Factory is solid every time.

We were a party of six girls in our 20s--I do admit that some of the guests at my party were being obnoxious, but I think it was more in retaliation to the ""off-the-bat"" rudeness of our server. I wasn't even given a napkin with my silverware. Attention to detail, people! Finally, the food was horrible. Between the 6 of us, not a single dish was appreciable. The vegetarians at the table got: Evelyn's pasta which was bland and undercooked, spinach and artichoke dip which, again was bland and the chips were thick and oily. Not restaurant style like we hoped for. Lastly, the pear and blue cheese flatbread. Flavor-wise it was good, but it came sliced once, and we asked them if they could take it back and slice it again, and we were met with a rude ""It was sliced in the kitchen"" by our server.

Apparently, the man behind the counter now was a manger or some sort of leadership and he went ahead at explained that they are boxing my order up now. That was 10 minutes ago.

I arrived at around 5PM and the restaurant was not busy at all. It was nice not having to deal with a long wait that is usually the signature of the Cheesecake Factory experience.  Our server, Jason, was fantastic. He was funny and very approachable.  We had a blended Margarita, the crab & artichoke dip, fried mac & cheese, and the hot spinach dip. I'm definitely not the best critic for alcoholic drinks, but the Margarita was okay to me. Heavy on the alcohol (which is a good thing, right?) with a good soury, fruity taste. Way worth it during happy hour.  Crab & artichoke dip and the fried mac & cheese are MUST-ORDERs. There's so much crab flavor in the dip. I could definitely just eat the dip by itself. The fried mac & cheese are just amazing too! Irresistible and pretty filling as an appetizer.  I would recommend against ordering the hot spinach dip unless you just really love spinach. Honestly, I didn't really even get slammed with the spinach flavor when I ate the dip. Maybe my taste buds were spoiled by the other flavorful items that I ordered, but the spinach dip was mediocre at best. The chips tasted better with the salsa and sour cream that the plate came with.  I will be coming back to happy hour here in the future. I'm just going to get smarter with what I end up ordering. Oh yeah, everything is $5 on their happy hour menu. What a steal!

This matters to us because my daughter is extremely allergic to dogs and has asthma attacks even when she walks into a room that a dog has recently been in.  For her, this is a matter of life or death, and we did not have an epipen with us.   Needless to say, we walked out when we saw our waitress playing with the dog as she brought our meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=360,2.64,2.9,2.944,2.404,2.7960000000000003

Located in downtown Palo Alto, this Cheesecake Factory is surprisingly spacious inside, unlike the other restaurants in the area. The last time I was here, I was ravenous (per usual), and ordered a full size The Everything pizza and the Luau salad for my sister and me to share. The Luau salad was like a mountain and very fresh, lots of variety; my only issue with it is that they definitely piled on too much dressing. The bottom of the plate was practically a mini pool. Then, the waiter confused our order and thought we had ordered a half pizza; they quickly put in another order of a half (which they ended up burning). So, after that whole debacle, my sister and I received only the half, but that was enough for two, and we even took the left overs to go. Bottom line: expect gigantic portions of food, drenched with oil/grease/dressing -- but space yourself for the cheesecake!

476,Jenna F.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,2,,1.0,2014-03-31,"I have been a patron of The Cheesecake Factory for about 10 years, which started in high school. Last Friday was the first time I was dissatisfied with the service, food and management.  It had been a while since dining at a Cheesecake Factory, so for my cousin's fairwell dinner, the six of us decided to eat here. We had two waiters, which in and of itself is odd considering we were only a six-top. The male waiter took our order.  We proceeded to have good conversation. then about 45 minutes after we ordered, the female waitress came by and said that it would be another 3-4 minutes because the kitchen was slammed (now I work in the food industry, so I understand when the kitchen gets busy). However when another 15-20 minutes passed without any food, we started wondering whether they forgot about our food. The manager even came by to apologize for the wait (which was good of her to check). When our food finally came and all of us received our dishes except for my boyfriend's, the waitress asked him if he ordered anything! It was appalling that she asked because she could have easily checked in the system. My boyfriend responded with a curt, ""Yes"" and she replied with ""Oh, I didn't take the order"" !!!  My boyfriend did get his food in the end. By this point neither of us want to eat. My uncle's food (he ordered the crusted salmon, which comes with some steak) was over cooked and tough (he had ordered medium rare). When I mentioned something to the waiter, he proceeded to take away the food, which meant my uncle had to wait even longer (though I admit, I may be partially to blame for his food being taken).  Finally, when we spoke to the manager about compensation for such a horrible meal, she only took 25% off the bill, without any voucher/discount to return to the restaurant. In the end, I blame the management for lack of training. Lack of instructing their staff how to deal with customers, how to alleviate a situation with upset customers. Because of this bad experience, likely my returning to the Cheesecake Factory is not going to happen in the near future or maybe ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=460,2.8,2.83,2.916,2.5640000000000005,2.8179999999999996

221,Andy B.,"San Ramon, CA",5,100,291.0,3.0,2014-06-04,"Man, what happened to the food quality at The Cheesecake Factory? When I was younger, I loved eating their fettuccine alfredo with sun-dried tomatoes and chicken. I don't really like it anymore now. The emulsion from the alfredo sauce would separate and I would get a nasty, deep yellow oil resting at the bottom of my to-go box when I would go to reheat my leftover. Service was fine. Host and waitress couldn't have done a better job. I just wasn't impressed with the food. Neither was my cousin. We both liked the fried macaroni and cheese balls, but everything else about our dishes just didn't have much of a taste. Maybe I should try another dish the next time I come to another The Cheesecake Factory, but I don't think I want to anymore. Another thing was that their cheesecakes leave a nasty ""chemical"" burped up aftertaste. Like the Red Velvet cheesecake tasted good, but after a while, you get tired of eating it all since the ingredients taste so dull from the overload of ingredients added on. It's as if everything is filled with processed stuff like preservatives to keep the flavor present. They even removed my favorite Oreo cheesecake and replaced it with a grosser version called the Oreo Dream Extreme cheesecake. Ew. Drop the prices of the food to how they really taste, which is average. We're really paying for the environment, name and the pretense that this is an established and trusted restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=220,2.96,2.78,2.896,2.572,2.852

This particular trip changed that. My boyfriend and I were walking down University Ave around 10:45 p.m. and EVERYTHING was closing down so we grudgingly walked to The Cheesecake Factory. Thankfully, we were seated immediately and had two very friendly, attentive waiters take care of us.  We initially wanted spinach dip and they were out. The waiter suggested crab cakes. Their crab cakes? AMAZING. I'd never pin them as having spectacular crab cakes, but they were delicious. They melted in your mouth, but we're breaded to perfection. The cakes were plated beautifully (too distracted by their deliciousness to take a picture) and the two dipping sauces that came with the crab cakes (one cold, one warm, both some sort of tartar) were dutifully cleaned up by us with bread. My only critique is that there were only three.  So if you're walking down University Ave around 11 and want a place to sit and eat, go here for the crab cakes.

Prior to coming here I heard many people refer to the menu as the Bible, not because it has life lessons or anything inscribed in it, but because its such a long and cumbersome amount of food to choose from. The choices of food are not better than the other.  Here are the dishes that we ordered. Appetizers: FRESH KALE SALAD 5.95 - Fresh but so so. Something anyone can make at home. Comes with a ranch dressing mixed with blue cheese dressing. Would have preferred a vinaigrette instead.  PORTABELLA MUSHROOM, AVOCADO & ZUCCHINI FRIES 6.95 - Interesting how everyone wants to make everything into fries these days. These do not fly so well. Eat with caution, vegetables get hot when fried. The avocado one was interesting, however I would not order again FRIED CALAMARI 11.95 - Decent taste, good texture. Way too pricey. Don't know how the ones at Pier 39 do it. So good. Thats what I'm comparing it to. The portion appeared big but its not.  Main Course: JAMAICAN BLACK PEPPER SHRIMP 18.50 There were others but this was mine and the only one I ate. Meh. Shrimp is actually hard to make good unless thrown with some noodles like scampi or served plain as a cocktail. The plate came with black beans and the shrimp was mixed with some sort of cajun seasoning. Way too pricey for something that could have possibly been made with the cajun seasoning in the herb section of the grocery store. Mix some rice and shrimp and voila.  Service: White knights of the cheesecake factory. The men and women that serve here range from the 20s to upper 40s to 50s. We had three servers come to our table and one of them who brought the bread, an asian guy, said the one basket he gave us was all that was left so eat sparingly. Wth? Apparently he lied or had a terrible sense of humor because our main server, the tall blond brought us a few baskets later. Bread is raved to be really good here. Eh, not bad. Its called honey wheat bread, its a dark brown/black color. Can't really complain about the service.

The bread is usually warm, and the selection of entrees is good and plentiful. Just beware that everything here (drinks and dishes) is sweetened to downplay their overtly sweet desserts. This particular location is a smaller version of what you'll find at Westfield Valley Fair.   On our last visit, we arrived in dusty, sweaty hiking gear. We had just clambered up Mission Peak, and were in dire need of beverage and sustenance. There was absolutely no judgment on the servers' parts about how we were dressed.

On a late weekend afternoon, the bar is usually empty. This is where you can find Justin, a rockstar bartender and server. We usually start with drinks and dessert before making it to the savory dishes.  Appetizers of note: crispy crab wontons, guacamole made-to-order (lemony fresh with a side of pico de gallo), and the fried calamari.  Standard entrees: grilled pork chops, fresh grilled salmon, and miso salmon. Just be careful not to burn your entire mouth like I did on the miso salmon. That sucker must have been sleeping under a salamander broiler, as it was still smoking after I had taken three very well-spaced bites. Warning next time, please and thank you?

I was surprised because I've never been to Cheesecake factory without having to wait. Apparently if you want to be immediately seated, you should come before lunchtime. I've gone to many different Cheesecake Factories in different cities, and this one was pretty comparable to the other ones that I've been to in regards to food. Our waitress was really nice, and she made sure we had everything we needed. As a con, although we were one of probably 5 tables filled, it took a pretty long to get our food (over 30 minutes). This may have been because we were one of the first tables of the day, but it was still pretty long. Complimentary Bread (4.5/5) - Sadly, one of my favorite things about coming to Cheesecake Factory is the bread. They had both the signature brown bread and a Sourdough baguette. Pretzel Crusted Chicken (4/5) - The pretzel crust made the outside very crispy, and the chicken itself was juicy. It came with two different sauces, which looked homemade and were tasty. The presentation was also nice. They arranged the chicken strips in a lattice pattern. Loaded Baked Potato Tots (2/5) - These were just wayyyy to rich for me. I guess Cheesecake Factory is known for their rich food, but the potato part of these tots had A LOT of cheese in them. Serving them with sour cream on the side seemed like overkill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=160,2.36,2.8,2.852,3.0200000000000005,2.624

Which was great!!!!!!! Even though they are a chain restaurant! They really do a good job with cooking their food! We even got the smores cheesecake for dessert which was heaven!!!!!! I mean you can't go wrong by getting dessert here! On the plus side their servings are enormous!!!

Experience: I went on a Saturday evening around 7:30. The hostess seemed a little busy handling other things while 2 small groups were waiting in front of me. She finally addressed them and then when I was next in line she walked away. She came back a few minutes later and I asked if I could sit at the bar (I probably could have jus walked to the bar without notifying her, but that felt weird). I sat at the bar and the bartender quickly gave me a menu. I ordered a cosmopolitan (they are also amazing at the Cheesecake Factory). The bartender made it satisfactory.  Food: I ordered the chicken potstickers and the Macaroni and cheese. For dessert I had the low carb cheesecake with strawberries. All the food was amazing and the low carb cheesecake almost tasted like the real thing.  The two male bartenders were great! However, there was a female server who could not stop cursing for the life of her (I mean I curse but not at work!).

We had almost 30 people in our party and only ONE PERSON took our orders. Smh The only time there was a lot of waiters around is when they came to hand out plates. However, even then it didn't really matter because not everyone's food even made it out of the kitchen. 2 people in our party NEVER EVEN GOT THEIR FOOD.  Seriously?! How can you not even bring someone's food out at all and don't even come back to apologize or bring something else to compensate for the missing dish? But instead, you just let them be hungry and watch everyone else eat their food.

286,Allyson Y.,"Sunnyvale, CA",6,69,7.0,2.0,2015-07-13,"I've been here twice and the service is slow! On my most recent visit, we arrived around 10pm for a late dinner and were seated right away in the bar area. Our server took about 10 minutes to ask what we wanted to drink and took another 15 minutes to bring out our water at which time she finally took our order. She was slow at waiting on all of the tables in her area and was forgetting to bring straws, drinks, boxes for leftovers, but of course she didn't forget to bring the check accompanied with an insincere smile in hopes of getting a decent tip. Nuh-uh! At around 10:45, we finally received our order. The fries that came out with the chorizo omelet were stale and cold and my chicken lettuce wrap tacos didn't have the avocado cream that was supposed to make it more flavorful. For about 15 minutes our waitress disappeared and I couldn't wait that long to ask if she could please bring a side of the avocado cream. I decided to eat my bland food because I was already starving and couldn't wait any longer. Not once did our waitress check to see how everything at our table was. We had to ask another waitress to refill our waters because ours was nowhere to be found. Once we finished our meal, I had to walk up to the bartender to ask for a box for my leftovers. He asked another server to bring one, but that took another 10 minutes. Our waitress reappeared so we finally asked for our check. She finally asked how everything was and we told her about the fries. She said, ""Oh, I'm so sorry! Would you like me to bring you a new one?"" Ummm no but if you had cared to ask about 25 minutes earlier how we were doing it would have meant more. She never asked if we wanted to get dessert, which we originally did but lost our craving for cheesecake when their service was so poor. Overall, she was not warm and friendly, offered slow service, and did not follow up with any of the tables in her area. I thought I saw a manager walk by, but he didn't seem to pay attention to the row of tables that were suffering from our slow server. I hope other customers don't have to experience this poor service.

206,Jeremy H.,"Stanford, CA",3,50,,1.0,2015-07-20,"Vegetarians, beware! Coming out of a mini Yelp retirement to comment on my experiences this past weekend. On Saturday night, a large group of us (12, to be precise) came to The Cheesecake Factory around 9:30 PM after a concert at Stanford. It took us 30 mins or so to be seated even though there were plenty of seats (we think they didn't have enough servers for the restaurant).  After we got seated, I ordered the avocado, mushroom, and zucchini fries. I asked our server (who was very friendly) what the soup of the day was, and after she told me it was chicken soup, I replied that I would stick with the vegetable fries since I'm vegetarian. Our food came some 20 minutes later. I was halfway through my ""fries"" - basically breaded and fried pieces of vegetables - when I bit into one, and had an unfamiliar taste and texture. I examined it carefully, and it most definitely was NOT a vegetable. It was impossible to tell before biting into it because the breaded pieces of zucchini and avocado were opaque and not distinct, but a WHOLE PIECE of chicken had been fried and included in my food, and I had accidentally eaten half of the piece. I notified my server (mainly to let them know so that if there was a mix up, other people wouldn't have to go through this), who said that my dish should not have any meat, but took the other half of the piece of meat back to the kitchen to investigate. She came out five minutes later to inform me that it was, indeed, chicken - she told me the kitchen in the back was a ""huge mess"" (her words) and apparently the kitchen staff had messed up. She also commented that the manager or general manager had been notified. She was apologetic and friendly, and ended up comping this dish. However, I'm giving The Cheesecake Factory one star, given that their server self-admitted that their kitchen was a ""big mess"" and that I was served meat in what was supposed to be a vegetarian dish. I don't ask much of my restaurants, but I would like confidence in a clean kitchen that is able to serve the food that is ordered and be organized enough to ensure that meat does not get into vegetarian dishes. Admittedly, their cheesecake was really good, but I'm going to have to give one of my rare one-star reviews here because of my experiences.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=200,2.64,2.81,2.832,2.148,2.742

However, this particular location has slow service and somewhat long waits. We came around 7:45 pm for a double date and waited about 20 mins before being seated.  Ambiance is intimate, but somewhat loud. They always provide bread with your meal- I really like the darker honey wheat bread. Menu is extensive, which can sometimes be problematic if you are indecisive like me lol I ended up ordering steak medallions on the skinny menu (Cheesecake Factory is know to be highly caloric). Steak was tender and decently seasoned. Mashed potatoes were totally lacking though- it was more like a thin layer at the center of the plate under the steak. I was able to finish my portion, but most of their entrees tend to be very large. I think they basically downsize the meal to fit their calorie limit on the skinny menu. We ordered artichoke dip to share, but it never came. Apparently, they ran out of artichoke dip and our server forgot to notify us. We got a blueberry cheesecake to share. The cheesecake at Cheesecake Factory is perfect every time-definitely save room for dessert if you come here :D Parking in downtown PA can be a bit problematic, so you might need to park a few blocks down to get spot.

The squid was tender to the point that you wouldn't need teeth to bite it. You can also tell that it was hand breaded. It also came with cocktail and garlic sauce! The garlic sauce was perfect! I just had to scrape every last bit of it off the bowl. The shrimp scampi on the other hand was meh. For a dish worth ~$20, I expected the pasta to be at least fresh. Not the kinds I can simply buy off grocery markets. Another con is the ends of the angel hair pasta. They were stuck together! The shrimp were good but a little over battered. The sauce was also overpowering with garlic. When I inspected them closely, there were 4 full cloves... I think dicing them up would be better?

158,Steve K.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,6,,1.0,2016-01-04,"I've been to Cheesecake Factory plenty of times in plenty of locations.  This particular location is one that you should stay away from (Palo Alto).  The owners should be embarrassed and corporate should look into punishing them. We arrived and were told there was a 10 minute wait.  Went to the bar, grabbed drinks, and waited to be buzzed.  Our buzzer buzzed and we went to the host station only to have to wait another five minutes while they sorted out which of the currently doing nothing hosts could actually accomplish the feat of directing my family to a table.  Servers stopped by to chit chat.  A manager came and somehow made it an even longer process. We get sat. (Yay!)  I chit chat with my family.  I read through the entire menu (if you've been to Cheesecake Factory, you know how long the menus are).  I read through the ads on the menu.  I realize that we've been at the table for lord knows how long and nobody has even stopped by our table to even say ""I'll be with you soon.""   I got to play the ""I need some attention"" game with servers passing by left and right, but none would pay attention.  Finally I managed to grab the host that sat us so he could find us a server.  Five minutes later... We order our food.  I decided to take the opportunity to run across the street to Apple and have something taken care of.  I walked over there while most of my family waited for food.  Turns out the line was long.  I waited.  I finally got taken care of and walked back.  I was sure my wife would be upset and my food would be cold.  Nope.  No food. After a while, two plates of food came out.  A reasonable amount of time passed and nothing else.  A few more minutes and I see the same person who delivered the first two plates come into the room.  He had someone else's food.  My wife points out that the people at the table next to us (who have been there a good 25 minutes at that point) have not been helped.  The people behind us are bent out of shape because they got ignored as well and one of there dishes was completely inedible.  (Pasta just completely soaked in oil) I'm flabbergasted.  Three more plates come out.  My poor wife.  No food for her.  We wait patiently.  Finally I had to stand up and get in front of our server and ask the question ""is my wife going to get food tonight?""  10 minutes later my wife finally got her food.  Fresh from the microwave. Did a manager ever come talk to us?  No. Did the server make sure we were taken care of?  No. We had to steal silverware from an empty table. We had to deal without ketchup for french fries. It took 5 minutes to refill my drink.  Which would have been plenty of time if my drink wasn't taken from me to refill it in the first place. I was so proud of my kids for not making a fuss for the entire meal.  They deserve medals.  We had one saving grace.  We had ordered an entire cheesecake at the beginning.  Now that it was an hour and a half later, we could eat it as soon as we got home. I arrived at home and opened my cheesecake...   They gave me the wrong damn cheesecake! The woman behind me never did get a satisfactory meal.  They left in frustration.  The family next to us eventually did get served... after I mentioned to both our server and the host who eventually got us our server.   Honestly, there are some great options in downtown Palo Alto.  Epi, a few doors down has great food and great service.  Nola is solid as well a few blocks away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=160,2.44,2.69,2.712,2.244,2.59

The manager came right away to apologize and said they will fix this immediately. Our food eventually came (after some wait) and no signs of meatball. The manager came over again and explain how it take too long to reheat them through, and offered to buy us our drinks and dessert by that time we just didn't care about the appetizer anymore.

I went for brunch and 3 of us decided to order the crab benedict.  Our server returned 5 min later to tell us it was not ready.  We were surprised by that and she offered to double check.  10 min later she returned and confirmed that we were out of luck.  So we ordered other dishes that varied from good to bad.  Among the bad (really bad) was a veggie benedict I ordered.  It was served on two overcooked and super greasy fried cakes of grains.  Served on top of that were tiny, cubed, grilled, overly greasy vegetables.  On top of that were two overcooked eggs (ala hard boiled consistency).  On top of that was an overly salty hollandaise sauce.  And next to this mess of a dish was an abundant side of super greasy hash browns.

Services:  Depending when you come here, you have a different crew.   - AM/Lunch crew:   Good services.  one of our entrees need to be re-do and the manager (a middle aged man) came over and explained.  We appreciate that a lot.  It was all proactive.   I would totally rate 4 stars for their effort.  - Takeout crew:  There was a female mgr that is not as friendly.  The crew seems to be afraid of her.   Food/drinks:    - Great bread before  - Black peppered Cajun Shrimp - Very tasty and spicy.  Would totally order this again. - Manderia Chicken - One of our favorites - Pasta Cabonara - with Shrimp.  The PA location seems to make their shrimp pretty good.  One of the pasta has GF option.  They can replace it with Brown rice pasta.  :)  - Salads - Most of their salads are solid and huge portion - Kids menu - Mac/Cheese - creamy and cheesy.   - Kids menu - Spaghetti and meatball.  OK.   One time, they told us they ran out of meatball and if we would just spaghetti with pasta sauce.   (Really???) Tips:  Sometimes their food is a bit salty.   It is your preference, but I would ask them to go light on the salt next time. Decor: Causal and lots of seating. Kids friendly:  Yes.     Gluten Free/Sensitivity:  There a number of options labeled as GF.  The only cheesecake that is officially GF is the Godiva chocolate.  It is really good!  My hubby is not a chocolate fan and he commented how smooth it is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=100,2.48,2.56,2.712,2.0600000000000005,2.528

My sister and brother in law spent the day at Stanford Hospital with my little niece who has recently been ill. Thankfully, she is on the mend but it gave us all quite a fright. They live in the central coast and since we are only 15 min away, we offered to meet them for dinner after work, they were both very tired from a long day and hungry but didn't want fast food. I told them we would head down and get a table and they could meet us there, hopefully we would have their food ready and waiting for them. So we get there at a quarter to 7, I put my name down for a table for 5 and the hostess says, give me 15 minutes.. ok not a problem as my sister and fam were still at the hospital. 30 mins later, a second hostess walks over and asks me if my whole party is here yet as she needs half of us to be here before she can seat us. I explained to her the situation and asked if that would be possible, she said ok and that she'd see what she can do. At this point, we are the only ones waiting for a table. In walks a group of 4 people, they get seated immediately, in walks another group of 3 and they get seated immediately. At this point, I am extremely irritated, if she couldn't do it, then she should say so and we can have the choice of going to a different restaurant. AS soon as I get up to go ask her again, my sister and brother in law walk in, I tell her my party is here and she walks away, the first hostess I encountered tells me she will have us seated in 2 mins. So by now, my family is here, they are tired and hungry and again, we are waiting. I was disappointed with the experience that my food didn't even taste good. I don't feel this was an unreasonable request as it was a monday evening and there was no wait time, plus, I was ready to order food for all of us at the same time. If it weren't for the fact that I didn't want to inconvenience my family and have them wait to eat any longer, we would have definitely left and eaten elsewhere. To top it off, my husband ordered the Shrimp Scampi and the shrimp tasted as tho there was uncooked batter on it, he was actually pretty sick last night and this morning. The only reason I am giving this place any stars is because yelp makes you give at least one, the other one is for the waiter who was kind and patient with us.

Eventually we just wanted to leave.  The second time I went here the same thing happened. We waited almost 40 min for one of the four cocktails we ordered because they claimed someone bumped into the person with the drinks. Fair enough, I've worked in the restaurant biz before and understand this happens... but then it took half way into our meal to get it. How much time does it take to make one drink again? Then the same person who had to wait for their drink that spilled also had to wait for their plate to come! They gave all of us our plates and he had to wait. We all sat and chose to wait to eat ours but eventually it took so long, and he was feeling awkward already for making us wait, so we started eating.

It took me a 1/2 hour to get there and find parking so I figured I'll be able to walk in, pay for the cheesecake, and leave. I gave my name at the dessert counter, paid, then waited. A couple behind me placed an order. I was waiting 10 minutes and asked why my cheesecake wasn't ready yet, after all I called ahead. And it wasn't a meal order. Just one whole cheesecake. I was told it would be right out and that someone was preparing it. I reminded them that I called ahead, so why wasn't it ready? The cashier apologized and said it will be right out. I went to the host and asked for the manager. While I was waiting (5 more minutes) two boxes were delivered from the back and the couple who had ordered behind me left with their order. The other order was mine. When the manager arrived I complained about the wait time but she couldn't explain why my order wasn't ready when I arrived.

This made me compelled to write a yelp review (which I never usually do). Arrived at 9 pm on a not so busy Monday night.  1. Had to ask for Bread, burnt bread was given to us. Never got offered bread again. 2. We ordered 4 dishes to be brought out at the same time for 4 people: 2 were brought out after 25 minutes (that's great), then we wait 45 minutes and had to remind someone we had additional orders so they then bring the third dish out. After 1 hour we ask where our 4th dish is and the waiter forgot we ordered it, went to the kitchen and then came back 20 minutes later to tell us they forgot to cook it, asking if we still want it without any apology???! We were 4 hungry people so obviously said yes- it took another 30 minutes to bring it out. 3. By this time we asked 2 people if we could speak to the manager- both disappear and don't come back. It took the MANAGER 45 minutes to come and talk to us, not really apologizing. She said she would go to the kitchen, find out what happened and come back. No sign of her for 25 minutes! Go to the front desk to find someone to talk to since our waiter basically doesn't do his job, and she is at the bar!! 4. They give us the check which has an item on there we didn't even order!

46,Amy C.,"San Francisco, CA",299,410,1301.0,4.0,2016-07-30,"Even though The Cheesecake Factory is a huge chain, I always get excited about their desserts. Since today was National Cheesecake Day, I knew I had to go (they always do a half-off every cheesecake slice on these days, and this year they were offering the promotion for two days in a row). Also, they have a new cheesecake that features my absolute favorite dessert flavor - hazelnut. We arrived around 5pm on a Saturday and the place was already packed with a 20 minute wait. I like how they give you an electronic thing to hold, so you can go outside, wander around other stores, and then come back when it starts buzzing. Once we were seated, service was quite fast and attentive. My boyfriend ordered the Factory Burger ($11.99), which came with cheddar cheese, tomato, grilled onions on sourdough bread or wheat loaf, with either french fries or green salad. The burger was cooked well and was juicy. It was an interesting choice to put it on sourdough bread since it looked almost like sandwich halves than a burger, but I appreciated the extra hardness and crunchiness of the sourdough. The green salad was nicely dressed but not sodden in oil. We also ordered a slice of their new cheesecake: chocolate hazelnut cheesecake topped with hazelnut crunch and Nutella ($7.95 normally, but half-price today from the promotion). It came with a generous amount of whipped cream on the side and Nutella drizzled on top. The cheesecake was heaven. It was very sweet and definitely a calorie bomb, but it was dessert heaven. The hazelnut flavor in the cake was strong, and combined with the Nutella on top, was almost too sweet, but I still loved it. I also like the added crushed hazelnuts in the middle layer for additional crunch. I also ordered an appetizer of buffalo wings ($11.99). These were pricy for the amount of food, but the appetizer itself was quite good. The buffalo wings were spicy and crunchy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside. I didn't quite care for the dipping sauce, which was a blue cheese dressing. I would have preferred a creamier dressing like ranch. Service was very friendly. They did forget to bring us bread which was disappointing, but overall they were very attentive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=40,2.32,2.51,2.688,2.32,2.434

I've gone to The Cheesecake Factory restaurants in Pleasanton, San Francisco, and San Jose and have yet to even experience this from ANY restaurant. I have gone to this Cheesecake Factory establishment before with my parents and the service had been very slow for there being no one there.  My friend called in a week before the date on 8/30 to reserve a table for 15 people, the person on the phone said no problem we will see you on 9/6. We call on 9/6 thirty minutes before the reservation to see if it was a possibility to move it to a later time. We explain to the receptionist what the situation is and her response was ""that's funny because we don't take reservations"". A very unprofessional answer to a customer and that should've been a hint. We get the restaurant and wait for the rest of our party. As we wait the receptionist pulls out a brush and brushes her hair!!!!! Not a joke. It blew our minds.  Finally after getting seated our orders are taken and all is going well. One hour after our orders were taken both appetizers and meals come out, yes, at the same time. We finished our meals and asked for boxes, take home desserts, and the check. We received one single bill when in the beginning we asked the waiter to split the check in whichever way is easier for her (some of us were waiters and understand the pain of split checks). After collecting money and cards we hand the bill to our waiter to get out of there as fast as we could. The waiter comes back to tell us that she cant take our money and cards because she can't split the check that way. We had given her the EXACT amount in cash, and 6 credit cards. We even wrote on the back the specific amount each card would be charged. We ask for the manager politely because at this point we are tired and had been there for 3 hours. 20 mintues later we explain the situation to the manager and she tells us she can't do it.

236,Marie R.,"Menlo Park, CA",13,2,,1.0,2016-09-26,"I went with my family to Cheesecake Factory for dinner this evening. Our dinner experience was so underwhelming, I cannot understand why people like this restaurant. To start, I checked in with the host stand and was told there would be 5-10 minutes wait. While we waited a number of parties were seated that had arrived after we did, but they were bigger parties and I wasn't worried. After three different parties the same size as ours were seated I went to check on how long our wait would be. Two different staff people checked the computer and the tables, and I was told that the computer showed we had already been seated, to which I replied that we were still waiting (right under their noses). After a few minutes of scrambling we were taken to a pair of empty tables that the hostess pushed together for us. Once we were seated our waiter was pleasant and competent. It took us a while to order, and even longer for our food to arrive. We started with the roasted artichoke, which was lovely. The beet salad with goat cheese was overly salty - who salts beets? My kids both ordered hamburgers which were adequate, though much too charred for their taste. My husband had the chicken Bellagio, which was tender but not particularly flavorful. He also had a side of asparagus, which consisted of six pieces of asparagus, which seemed skimpy. I had the Thai glazed salmon, which was served on a bed of rice with mixed vegetables. The salmon was moist and nicely cooked, but the glaze and the vegetables were so heavily salted they were pretty much inedible.

105,Zoe Y.,"San Francisco, CA",952,213,239.0,1.0,2016-12-03,"0 stars! Literally the worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. My boyfriend lives close to this location and we always order take-out because I love CF. We have had a few orders wrong from here before, but it's usually something small (for example, they often forget to give Cesar salad dressing with the Cesar salad). Upon our last visit (November 20, 2016) we walked through at about 11pm and placed an order to go. We ordered a Cesar salad, the Four Cheese pasta, Shrimp and Sausage pasta, and two Mango Key Lime cheesecakes. After waiting approximately 30 minutes for our order, we finally received it and checked it and left. When we got home, my boyfriend pulled out his pasta (shrimp and sausage) and it was wrong! Even though we checked it (both dishes have rigatoni), we were deceived by the similar pasta and the condensation on the clear takeout lid. His dish (I included a picture) was probably the worst thing I have ever tasted in my life. I have no idea what it was, but it was terrible. I called the manager, Amy, back, however it was after they closed and they could not do anything for me at the moment. She asked if I paid with a credit card or cash, and unfortunately I made the mistake of paying with cash. She said she could either send me a gift card ""in the mail"" or I could come in and have it re-made, but there was no way to get a refund. I gave her my address and 2 weeks later, have still not received anything. She was so rude and unhelpful when clearly her incompetent employees cannot tell the difference between Shrimp and Sausage pasta vs Rigatoni with vegetables. We will not return; instead we will gladly drive the extra 15 minutes to a different location. I do not recommend this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=80,2.12,2.4,2.596,1.284,2.2880000000000003
107,Patrick A.,"San Jose, CA",169,85,139.0,2.0,2016-12-05,"(This was hard to write.) I went to Cheesecake Factory in Palo Alto with my girlfriend for a quick bite before going home after work. Our visit started out well, but it ended in disappointment. Our server was a very friendly woman named Maria S. and she began trying to sell us drinks and appetizers during the walk to our seats, which was a first for us both. When she sat us, in her section of course, Maria immediately tried selling an appetizer and ""something hot"" to drink once more. When we said that water was fine to start, Maria questioned our decision, ""That's all you want for now?""  From the time she dropped off waters and bread and pushed apps to the time she took our order, we waited 19 minutes. She continued to repeat what we said, but she repeated it as a question, which was a little unnerving after the fifth time. Either way, her soft-spoken voice and kind demeanor made it easy to accept. However, we still had to declare ""no appetizer"" three times. I sympathized at first, then it became hard.  When our food was delivered by the food runners (just under 20 minutes later), my beer had not been delivered. Maria was nowhere in sight so I could voice my complaint, so I went to the bar myself, and sure enough she was right there socializing with her coworkers. I asked the bar tender for a 16 ounce Stella. 13 minutes later I was walking back to my seat. Being a bit annoyed, I walked right past Maria and she didn't say a word when she saw me with my beer.  I sat down and began eating my now cold Chicken Madera, and she was still nowhere to be found. 20 minutes later, she walked past our table with a couple waters and a basket of bread for a table near ours, but she didn't say a word. She absolutely missed the two-bite rule. In fact, she didn't stop to talk to us until it was time for her to try and sell more. We asked for the check and she insisted that we order a cheesecake. ""No, thank you,"" we said together. She ignored us, ""One or two pieces?"" she said. Again we said ""no."" Then she asked again, ""What? No cheesecake? Are you sure?"" Now, I was completely frustrated, so I quickly replied, ""No!"" She came back five minutes later with our check, and, of course, she charged us for the beer.  At first, I was convinced that she had simply forgotten to deliver the beer, but after she began arguing that she delivered it, she insisted that the beer I had was the beer that she delivered. That's when I knew that she was lying and was hoping that we missed the extra charge. I declined once more. At this point, my smile was gone. I politely asked her to remove it, which she said agreed to do and asked to take my credit card, but she had lost my trust, and I was unwilling to provide my payment directly to her. That's when we decided to pay at the front. 12 minutes later, she found us in the front, handed me the check, said ""Have a good night, bye!"" and quickly walked away. Amy (the manager) came out to great us, but I was too frustrated to speak to her in length, so I only mentioned that I had to buy my own beer. She stated that she would ""follow up"" with Maria, but I was not convinced. Tonight, at the Cheesecake Factory in Palo Alto, which is one of my favorite places to eat, it was the first time that I had ever felt judged by a fellow Latino, it was the first time that a server ever tried to charge me extra and insist it was my mistake, and, worst of all, it was the first time at Cheesecake that I ever received poor service.

He could not locate 1st waiter and proceeded to take our food order. About 15min later (35min total) 1st waiter appeared with drinks order. And did not bring everything we ordered! 3rd waiter appeared 15 min later and said that they did not ha e a food order for our table. She did excuse the situation but then took the food order again.

It came out so ridiculously salty I had to return it. The manager told me that it indeed was too salty because they changed their salt type and that they will make another one for me. After another half an hour wait I had to tell them that my baby was becoming uneasy and I have to have it to go. When I opened the package at home, the chicken was burnt and it was obvious that it was cooked on a pan that was used to cooked another dish. There were burnt pasta pieces(two different types of pasta btw) on it, and there was a sweet taste to the chicken which should not exist in the order I had (it was from the sauce of another dish). I am disgusted by the food I received.

179,Dan J.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,16,6.0,2.0,2017-01-28,Thought we could have an early meal in a relaxing atmosphere but were disappointed. There was a large contingent of overactive pre-teens having a birthday party. Their behaviour and volume was more appropriate for a pizza parlor rather than a fine dining establishment. Their loud and raucous activity made it difficult for us and other diners to carry on a conversation. There was very little or no parental supervision and it's not the kids fault they acted that way it's whoever was in charge. It seemed like the wait staff tried to calm them down by dimming the lights hoping they would speak softer but it really didn't help. Nobody from the wait staff even tried to tell them that they were too loud.

77,Ron Y.,"Palo Alto, CA",20,75,11.0,1.0,2017-01-29,"Normally I don't criticize chain restaurants. I'm a food snob, so I feel bad calling out chains, since they do some things well (e.g., consistent level of quality across locations, family friendly, affordable, good for big parties). * * * However, my dish today was so disappointing that I need to tell you to NOT order the fried chicken & waffles benedict. I decided to order it because I saw the promo photo on their big LCD screen while waiting for a table. The photo looks like this:  It looks tasty, right? Fried chicken? Waffles? Poached eggs? Yum. What was wrong with my dish today: 1) poached eggs were hard boiled, and 90% of the surrounding egg whites were gone. They were basically two tiny almost-hard yolks wrapped with a thin layer of egg white. I suppose the chef cracked the eggs into a pot of water at rolling boil, so the egg whites dispersed. 2) the waffles were thin and super soggy. The promo photo shows thick and crispy belgian waffles with maple syrup in small metal cup. However, my dish came with the syrup already applied to the waffles (no metal cup). Since service was very slow, my thin waffles were mushy by the time they came to the table. Plus, it didn't taste like real maple syrup. It had a sickening fake butter taste to it. It reminded of me of ""table syrup"" from my elementary school cafeteria. 3) the chicken tenders were very small. I guess the chef is trying to help me lose weight. Otherwise, they tasted fine. (It was the best part of the dish).  On the bright side, this location is much less busy than other locations (e.g., at Valley Fair). If only there were other kid friendly restaurants in Palo Alto that can handle parties of 9+.

76,Karen H.,"San Diego, CA",14,1,,1.0,2017-02-04,"DON'T FORGET YOUR PONCHO OR SHIELD! And don't count on the manager to manage. I admit that I don't like leaving reviews because it can affect one's livelihood, but there was no way I could in good conscience not warn others about this incident.  Coming here can result in bodily harm, or at least harm to your clothes! I came with my family and purposely sat at the bar so we could watch a Warriors game while eating dinner.  We know that bar service can sometimes be hit or miss, but we didn't think we might actually get hit (with flying debris)! When my parents sat down, they saw water and ice all over the counter.  It was assumed that the previous guest had just been messy, but guess it was a sign of things to come. Throughout our short stay, a lovely (insert sarcasm here) bartender, named Scott, gave us a pregame show of continually slamming dishware (can only hope it wasn't glass) in the bin that must've been in front of the counter where we were sitting.  Thankfully his aim was almost as good as the Warriors'; that said the accuracy didn't continue... We didn't say anything because we didn't want to cause a fuss, but maybe if we did, we could've avoided the escalation of action. Scott's first miss of the ""basket"" was a plastic cup that bounced on the counter and almost knocked over my mom's wine glass before falling back behind the counter.  At this point I called the other bartender over to tell him about the situation.  I acknowledged that Scott might be having a bad day, but asked if our bartender could talk to him and stop the show.  He assured us he that he would talk to Scott and apologized about the slamming of dishware. Unfortunately, before he was able to speak with Scott, the next miss happened and the result was the remaining ice and drink in the cup he was throwing, splashing all over the counter, my parents, and myself.  Sorry Scott, I think only coaches of winning teams get this type of treatment at the END of a game. The result: my mom immediately screamed!   Scott's response: a haphazard, ""I'm sorry..."" As he slowly wiped up the mess with a rag.   The manager's response (who happened to be at the drink receiving station at the time, kudos on the timing): ""What happened?"" And then he walked around to the back of the counter to approach Scott. My dad and I pushed back from the counter and tried to wipe the mess off ourselves.  My mom immediately went to the hostess counter to ask for the manager.  Just a note: if you're the manager and see something like this you should immediately apologize and start handling the situation.  The fact that my mom didn't see you and ran to the front of the restaurant, to seek you out speaks volumes.  As my dad and I were wiping ourselves off, the manager looked at me wiping my face with my sleeve and proceeded to Scott instead of even offering napkins for us to clean ourselves with (this was so far into the meal that we hadn't even received napkins yet!) or apologize.  Here was another chance for you to manage, manager! At this point, I lost all faith in the manager being able to handle the situation and didn't even bother trying to speak with him.  I got up and gathered our jackets to leave.  My mom came back with the hostess, who pointed the manager out.  She looked 100% more concerned about the situation than both Scott and the manager. My parents spoke with the manager for a bit, before I butted in and said I had already been splashed on and we should just leave.   At this point they continued walking to the front talking and got the manager's card before we finally left.  The manager said he would speak with the bartender, but didn't really apologize or grab our contact information to follow up with us.  When we left, Scott was still working behind the bar... In the end, I'm thankful that glass shards didn't hit us in the face and that we only left with dirty clothes and not more injuries from the assault.  Amazing that this can happen in a major chain restaurant, but at least we can follow up with corporate about our concerns because this manager clearly didn't care.  Scott clearly seems to have an anger management issue and should probably avoid human interaction anytime in the near future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=60,1.6,2.19,2.508,1.988,1.954

H.,"Santa Clara, CA",1,18,,1.0,2017-02-09,"Update on 2/10/17: So the manager added their comment asking me to go to their contact web page, which requires me to add in lots of required personal information, and then I suppose I have to recount the whole experience in the Comments section, again. This feels like a lot of work, there is a way for business to send message to members to avoid yet another step of web form. And why can't a restaurant phone number and contact name be provided for customers to call back? Or is this to make customers just give up, and stop complaining as well as going to this business??? ---------------------------- The latest review about needing a rain poncho - I think one also need skates to walk in their bar area. For about couple years now the stone flooring in the bar area is always slippery, obviously due to food/drinks spilled on the floor, and lack of proper cleaning. It was to the point you can easily slipped if you're wearing leather sole shoes or heels. Many of my friends joked about ice skating.  Surely the management understand the liability risk here? About bartenders?  It's a hit or miss. I have observed one bartender who does seem to be making a lot of noise behind counter, not sure if it's the same one from the other review. That does take away the supposed calm and enjoyable ambiance a bit. And for sure not the high end restaurants their competitors are on same street.

I was extremely disappointed in both the quality of food and the attitude of the waitstaff tonight. We were seated in A timely fashion, but that was the only part of our experience that was decent. We were led to a small booth right next to the bathroom and a service station. Before seating ourselves we asked if there was another table available and the guy who was seating is (not a host, some staff member in all white) rudely responded ""no. That's all we have. You can wait for another table."" So, we sat down anyways. We were 4 tall adults and the booth barely fit us. About three minutes later, I noticed a party of two was seated in a bigger booth near ours. After some time, the server came with waters and bread and told us she'd be back shortly. Five minutes later she returned and we were ready to order. The server was nice and took our drink and food orders.  We didn't have any napkins so we asked her for some. I ordered the hibachi steak medium and my mother ordered the steak Diane medium. The other two people ordered a salmon dish and a shrimp dish. When the food arrived I noticed immediately that both steaks were clearly overcooked. There was no pink at all, definitely NOT medium. We were hungry, so we are. After five minutes the server came to ask how the food was. I told her that the steaks were cooked well done and not to our liking, and the salmon was dry as well. She didn't ask if we wanted the dishes re-done, if we would rather have anything else, I don't think she even apologized. She just nodded and so my father again asked for napkins (which she had never brought) and she used that opportunity to leave. She brought the napkins and that was the last we saw of her until the check. Never asked if we wanted anything else or another round of drinks. Another server eventually caught my eye and came over to ask if I needed anything. I asked for a box and the check, which he brought. The original server only returned then to run our check, forgetting to bring back the credit card. We asked another server for it and left after paying. I really live Cheesecake Factory but probably won't return to this one since the staff seems to be mediocre at best.

101,Amy K.,"Foster City, CA",19,126,24.0,2.0,2017-03-24,"Chain restaurants are not my go to places to eat, but my 10 year old son loves Cheesecake Factory.  And since it was his birthday, I obliged. We went on a Thursday evening around 6:30 pm. The two of us were seated immediately.  Our server took our drink order soon after we were seated. My son wanted a fountain drink and our server suggested a Shirley Temple. But when he returned with my water, he informed us that they were out of Shirley Temples. WHAT!?  So my son asked for a Sprite. Nope. The Sprite machine was empty.  How is a soda machine at a huge chain restaurant empty?  He ordered a Roy Rogers instead.  For dinner my son had the kid's menu fried chicken sliders with fries. It was your run of the mill chain restaurant sliders. Nothing special.  I ordered the hamburger and side salad off the Skinnylicious menu. Don't do it!  You'll be extremely disappointed!  When my burger came out, I almost wanted to laugh...really!?  I realize this is supposed to be a lower calorie dish, but come on!  I was served a slider sized hamburger patty on a regular sized brioche bun with a side salad. I seriously thought the burger was a joke. At least if you're going to cut the size of the burger, cut the size of the bun to match. It was absolutely ridiculous to serve such a small burger in the middle of a gigantic bun. I wish I had taken a picture of this to show how absurd this dish looked!  If I'd known it was going to come out like that, I would've just ordered sliders and only eaten one of them. At least the bun to patty ratio would've made sense, as opposed to my having at least half of my bun wasted because there was no meat to go with it. Seriously, who thought that dish with that presentation was a good idea?  He or she should be fired! I felt like I was getting cheated in my meal or the kitchen playing a very distasteful joke on me. So disappointing. Here's a tip, if you want your customers to think they're eating on the healthier side, don't make them feel like they made the wrong choice or feel awful because they can't have the full size meal with your presentation. Make them feel like they made a good choice and are satisfied with what they ordered. At least the side salad and dressing were good and decently presented.  And really, Cheesecake Factory, are you that cheap that you can't even offer a kid a free ice cream on his birthday?  Of course I bought him an ice cream sundae since it was his birthday (and he doesn't like cheesecake). But I would've thought such a huge chain restaurant would give it's birthday customers at least a free scoop of ice cream with a candle in it. Geez! But as I said, I'm not all in to chain restaurants. I'm giving it 2 stars because the food wasn't awful, just meh.

We just sat at a high top table by the bar to avoid the wait list.  A server helped us right away, got our drinks, and some bread to munch on. Thank goodness she did because our apps took about 25 minutes to come out. She did acknowledge and apologize for the wait and as we were not in a hurry, we didn't make a big deal of it. Apps - fried mac and cheese and crab wontons. They were typical appetizers, prepared well, and were served with plenty of dipping sauce. Cheesecake - we tried the chocolate hazelnut crunch! I just found out this is a rather new option on the menu. It was delicious - it may be taking the spot for my top choice (replacing the red velvet)! The creamy Nutella with the crunchy crust is a perfect combination.

We came in at 6:30 and ordered appetizers and dinner for kids (with 1 toddler and 2 kids), and then ordered 5 adult entrees. Needed two booster seats, which were not given for about 10 minutes or so. When asking the waiter about them, his response was verbatim ""I'm a little busy right now, I'll get to it in a minute."" We waited an hour before asking for the manager and asking what happened to our food. Nothing was done, we were told food was 2 minutes out. Then appetizers and entrees all came out together (which we specifically asked that appetizers come out first ) at 7:45PM. Given the delay, we didn't even touch our appetizers. Then, asked the waiter for water for our toddler and waited over 10 minutes for water. When asked where the water was, his response was ""Yea,"" and brought it out 5 minutes later. It was my bday dinner and my husband ordered my favorite cheesecake, which the staff had to ask about 3 times to apparently confirm which cheesecake slice it was.  Gabriele B was a rude server and I would never in my life hire someone like him. I have worked in the service industry and have never spoken to any customer the way he spoke to us. We were not rude, or impatient with him and literally until the end of the dinner, we gave him the benefit of the doubt, but he not did not apologize once for his service nor did he rectify the situation or errors in anyway, other than a few app's which we didn't even eat. Not only was he apathetic, but he smirked and laughed as we left, to the point where neither my husband, nor I, nor our friends wanted to tip him. I highly recommend this specific location find a better server.  After we went to a manager three times, she (Jenna) came to the table to apologize profusely, but at that point we were packing up, paying our bill (which we had to take to the front to pay as our waiter was disinterested in serving us and was busy meandering with his friends), and we told the manager he was quite possibly the worst employee we've ever seen in any establishment.

I didn't expect that I would have to wait another 20 minutes for the sauce to come at which point we had both finished our meal. The waiter took my cold pasta to the back where they mixed it and brought it back out.  As you can imagine, it was half cold and half warm as they mixed it in the back.

It has always been one of my favorite spots so for me to give it 1 star review means they really were not up to par today. I was by myself so I sat in the bar, no wait. That might have been a sign. I ordered my usual favorite, chicken piccata with white rice instead of the usual pasta it comes with. 20 mins later food comes out, I was ok waiting, the bread was good as usual and was watching basketball game on tv. As I started to dig in I realized right away something was off. It didn't taste right. After 3 or 4 bites I realized the chicken piccata was missing a key ingredient, the capers. You cannot have chicken piccata without capers, otherwise the dish tastes like a bland chicken in cream sauce... no flavor. I was waiting for waiter to come around so I could complain, but he was so busy with 3 new tables that I started to pick at it. To make it worse they even messed up the rice, it was mushy and not good. So my whole plate sucked but I was hungry... my waiter never came back to check on me so I ate it.... how can you complain about a dish after you have eaten it all.... so I paid and left, gave my usual tip because I felt guilty somehow like it wasn't his fault the dish sucked and he was over sat. 15 mins after leaving when my stomach started to ache I realized I would never be back to this location .... what is the point of having a chain restaurant if each location cannot make the dishes the same.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=160,2.36,2.15,2.444,1.8920000000000003,2.234

So after about 20 minutes, one of us went to the counter to ask for an attendant. We ordered drinks and I ordered their Special Lemonade on the menu. The lemonade came and I asked if it was the special lemonade - the server said there's no such thing as Special Lemonade. I pointed it out on the menu and I got a smile and a comment that it simply has more ice than the regular one!! Ohhh...okay....so we ordered our food. Despite the place being almost empty, it took another half hour to get our food...with the one seated next to us who came after us being served first. So we kept our cool. I ordered the Miso Salmon which I proceeded to eat....until I bit into a shrimp tail which was sandwiched between the salmon and rice. It was NOT a shrimp...it was the SHELL of a shrimp tail!!!

The server said fish and shrimps are in the same category...we were flabbergasted!!

21,Karen K.,"San Francisco, CA",187,66,451.0,2.0,2017-10-19,"This review will primarily focus on the lack of quality in service at this particular location of this chain restaurant. If I were to rate the restaurant solely on its service (or lack thereof), I would be rating this location with one star. Not that the food was great--there was an onion peel (the very exterior layer) in the burrito. My waiter, Roger, was the only staff member I interacted with, so I am assessing this restaurant's service on the basis of his performance, assuming that the staff are trained to represent the chain well. The reason why I found myself at the Cheesecake Factory in the first place was because a friend of mine had been furiously craving an appetizer of deep-fried mac & cheese balls, and I was accompanying her. Turns out the only incentive (the mac & cheese balls) for us to be there in the first place was nonexistent--they had run out. (This was 6:30 pm.) After my friend expressed how bummed out she was, Roger explained that it was a popular item and asked her why she hadn't come earlier.  I see a problem in this question. I think that it's inevitable for a restaurant to be out of stock of certain items, but, personally, think it's unreasonable for a waiter to ask a diner why she didn't arrive earlier so that she could order this item, especially five hours before the restaurant's closing time. Roger offered an alternative--regular mac & cheese, and my friend ordered it, along with our other food orders. Allow me to note here that Roger was not writing anything down, but said, 'Yeah, I'll put that order in for you.' Later, after some other food items arrived, my friend asked Roger if her mac & cheese was on its way. Roger proceeded to deny that she had ordered the mac & cheese. He said, 'You never ordered that.'  I see two problems here. First, Roger has no solid evidence to assert that she never ordered the mac & cheese, considering he wrote nothing down, as well as the fact that there were two others (the third member of my party and me) that witnessed my friend ordering the mac & cheese. The second problem lies in Roger's failure to follow the norms for waiting staff. For the sake of argument, let's say that my friend did not order the mac & cheese. Even in this case, Roger should apologize for the mistake and promise to get it right away if he were a 'good' waiter in the orthodox sense of the phrase.  The above problems can be summarized by Roger's inability to recognize and/or attempt to compensate for his inabilities. Aside from the mac & cheese problem, he forgot other things that we asked for, i.e. boxes. He failed to bring the proper number of menus and failed to bring dessert silverware with or before the arrival of the dessert. I doubt I will ever find myself at this/a Cheesecake Factory ever again, but in the event that I do, I hope that my waiter or waitress is more qualified.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=20,2.36,2.18,2.3,1.6400000000000001,2.2520000000000002

My mom doesn't have a sense of humor but whatever. Came here Friday night, to a 20 minute wait. Found a few seats in the bar, and then quickly got called to a table. They don't transfer tickets, which is inconvenient for patrons, but we settled it and then went to go eat. We ordered appetizers at the same time as an entree; guacamole (mild), shrimp spring rolls, beet and goat cheese salad, and the lemon garlic shrimp pasta. He didn't ask us whether we wanted appetizers first, but something happened in the kitchen anyway. We waited 20 minutes before our server even came back to check on us, and we had to inquire about our food. As soon as he walked away, other runners came out with everything. Okay, what is the purpose of an appetizer then? We dug in, and wow. If we were coming here for overpriced, over AND under-seasoned mediocre food, we hit the jackpot! The guacamole was INCREDIBLY salty. I've never had guacamole that salty in my life. There we also huge pieces of cilantro stalk, which made it a little cumbersome to even get a bite. We told the server about the guac and he took it back, and off the bill, but WOAH. I absolutely don't recommend ordering this. It's like, the easiest dish to prepare and get right! He told us that they prepare it in the morning, and that it may have gotten saltier over the day. Really? They make one giant batch in the morning for the whole day? And THEN it took 20 minutes to throw on a plate?  Then, the Lemon and Garlic Shrimp Pasta was flavorless. We had asked in advance if it was particularly garlicy and he said no, we'd taste the lemon over the garlic. Honestly, it tasted like nothing. Butter and parsley (which was the garnish). How lame! The shrimp spring rolls were ok - I found them on the dry side, and the peanut sauce wasn't much of a help, since it was on the blander side as well. My beet and goat cheese salad was more green apple than anything. There were 5 tiny chunks of beet on the whole plate. Boo you guys. I've been to the Cheesecake Factory at Oakridge Mall plenty of times - that's how it should be done. Sorry Palo Alto, will NOT be back.

Not sure if 2 of us are supposed to start eating or wait 20 min for everyone else to get their food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=20,2.28,2.17,2.256,,2.214

27,Claudel M.,"San Francisco, CA",32,16,,1.0,2017-11-30,The cheesecake factory was my favorite place to go for happy hour until yesterday. I ordered a cheeseburger and it came out with a burger split in half and a bite taken out of each half when it should have been 2 double patties. I showed the bartender Robert and he was so discustedhe called the manager and I showed the people at the bar and it turned out they had the same . It seemed as thou a crack head was in the kitchen and the manager was like well do you want another burger??????? I said are you kiddin me and no . Whatever crack head you have in that kitchen is not making me another meal he would probably spit on it. WELL it turns out he did this to 3 other customers . So I called corporate and they offered me a $15 gift card .  ARE YOU KIDDING ME  KEEP IT IF THAT'S THE BEST YOU CAN OFFER TO A LOYAL CUSTOMER. I'VE OWNED SEVERAL REST AND OUR CUTOMERS WERE THE MOST VALUABLE  IN THE WORLD AND WITHOUT THIER LOYALTY  WE SIMPLY WOULD NOT EXIST.

After they brought my plate back to the kitchen, we was waiting for more than 20 minutes, my boyfriend food getting cold because waiting for my food. The terible customer service not end up right there, after they brought out my food, its really cool! . It means entire the time they bring my food to the kitchen to put the shrimp, they let my food sit there  and not even warm it up, just put the shrimp on. The shrim was over cooked , it hard & chewy . When we paid the gift card, it took us 20 minutes to get my bill back because the girl didn't know how to use it.

YOU WILL REGRET THIS MEAL A THOUSAND TIMES OVER** 1) Doordash might be to blame for the completely cold meal I just ate, but TCF is to blame for the rest of the problems. 2) I ordered the fettucine alfredo which came cold, in a literal pool of oil or butter, the noodles were probably tossed in the fat to keep from sticking, but they used way too much, and it was gross. 3) the ""alfredo"" (white, bland, unsalted, no garlic, no parmesan, cream) is probably from a can, unseasoned, and totally soulless. no flavor whatsoever. the garlic bread had more seasoning and garlic than the alfredo. Also: I ordered extra sauce... I received two 2-ounce cups with sauce. this.. was not enough to even cover the noodles at all, glad I ordered extra... or, am I? that shit was disgusting. 4) WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS TIRAMISU? IS IT A CHEESECAKE? this is the worst tiramisu I have ever had. greasy, flavorless. no heart. no soul. shaped like a piece of brown cheesecake, with whipped cream on the side, and a very .. unflavored cake bottom that is not a lady finger base at all.. no espresso (the color in the weird center is brown, maybe that's it...) no amaretto, no marsala flavor,.. nothing. gross. fucking gross.

1,Eric N.,"San Marcos, CA",0,1,,1.0,2018-01-02,"First of all, let me start off by saying that I LOVE Cheesecake Factory and have been to more than 15 locations. All of the ones that I've been to have pretty much had their stuff together and I can't say that I've ever had a really bad experience at any of them. However, this Cheesecake Factory was a whole different story. We walked in and the hosts and the people who were standing behind the Cheesecake counter were arguing with each other about something. Not a big deal, we thought. One of the hosts took us a a table and our server took our order. Then I started noticing that both the table to left and to the right of us were unhappy and asked our server to take some of the entrees back. Then one of our entrees came, the Shrimp Scampi, and it turned out to be very spicy. Now, I have ordered the Shrimp Scampi from Cheesecake Factory quite a few times and it is supposed to have a little kick to it but this one was drowned in red pepper. So, I told our server and asked to exchange it for a different pasta, and to my surprise, she just said okay and took it back. I wasn't expecting a big apology or anything like that, but the way she reacted and casually said ""okay"" made it seem like entrees coming out wrong is a very common occurrence here. Yikes! Later, we ended up ordering a cheesecake and she brought us a carrot cake instead, which I had to send back again! Throughout the entirety of the meal, I actually saw servers arguing with each other in plain view of customers (one server actually yelled ""ugh!"" and walked off). The food itself came out very slowly from the kitchen and honestly wasn't as good as other Cheesecake Factories. Lastly, when we were walking out, there were customers waiting to be seated but all 3 of the hosts were standing away from the counter and none of them attended to those customers. Finally, one of the girls from behind the Cheesecake counter walked over and yelled ""way to do your jobs, guys!"" at the Hosts and once again in plain view of customers!!!  Once again, I really do like Cheesecake Factory but it was incredibly surprising to see one function this poorly. Everyone from the Hosts, to the servers, to the kitchen didn't seem like they were very good at their jobs. Next time, I will probably be going to the location in Westfield Valley Fair rather than this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto,1.88,2.06,2.18,,1.988
