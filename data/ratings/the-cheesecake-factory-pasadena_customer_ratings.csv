536,Peter K.,"Pasadena, CA",1,9,1.0,3.0,2012-01-02,"The factory is pretty much what you can expect from a restaurant chain -- big crowds and noise, and even bigger portions.  Cheesecake is the Michael Bay of restaurants, where the explosions happen somewhere besides on the big screen. If that's not enough to stomach, you can try to digest that huge menu of theirs.  Seriously half of the items could be removed and no one would notice. The food is fine but short of exceptional. One of their best dishes is their herb crusted filet of salmon.  I also love the brown bread -- you can skip the white bread.  Food might improve if they weren't trying to cater to so many tastes. The service is fast. Heck I went to the restroom after finishing my plate and they cleared it off while I was gone.  When I got back the hostess didn't recognize me and told me it wasn't a self seating restaurant lol.

437,KD M.,"Covina, CA",69,71,38.0,4.0,2012-01-18,"I went here with a few girlfriends on Saturday night and I had a really good time. For starters, they don't take reservations and for a party of 4 we waited over an hour just for a table even though they said it would be a half hour. It was busy and people were crowding around the tiny hostess stand bumping into me and other people left and right. Really, all this fuss for Cheesecake Factory? I was busy talking to my friends though so it didn't bother me too much. Anyway, our servers name was Josh and he was so sweet and attentive. He didn't make any mistakes and he brought everything out in a timely manner. I even spoke to the manager to tell him how good the service was. I ordered the four seasons pizza (I think thats what it's called), and it was okay, nothing out of this world but still yummy nonetheless. Portion sizes are huge here too, I only had a slice and a half and I was done, but then again I eat like a little birdy! It isn't my favorite place, but the ambience  was really nice and I'd come back if I'm in the Pasadena area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=440,3.04,3.65,3.32,3.152,3.406
464,Neen H.,"Temple City, CA",235,47,8.0,4.0,2012-01-20,"I'm a regular and come once a week for mostly lunch.   Service First and foremost this is where they excel at this location.  They have consistently excellent service.  When there is a problem a dish they are very quick to correct the problem and offer comps (like taking off the dish or giving you free Cheesecake).   To compare and contrast, the Arcadia location's service is no where near this attentive. When they are accepting applications for servers, which is only a couple times a year, I've been told they receive hundreds of applications and only choose a select bunch to become servers.  I think their service is largely credited to that process. Food Being a regular, I cycle through my favorite dishes and they are consistently good and served freshly made and piping hot. Recommendations: Snack Plate: Fried Zucchini   Soup: Wednesday's Baked Potato Soup (order extra hot) Appetizer: Fried Mac & Cheese Mains: The Pecan Crusted Cat Fish (this is an off the menu special) Chicken Bellagio (tender breaded chicken filet over pesto marinated spaghetti ) Pasta Da Vinci (their most popular pasta, sweet sauce, tender chicken) Herb crusted Salmon - lunch portion is very generous...order it with broccoli instead of asparagus  Skinnylicious Menu: Taco's plate (chicken) fantastic, light, healthy Cheesecake: Red Velvet, Pumpkin (seasonal), key lime The Bad This place doesn't take reservations and gets so busy its frustrating.  Even on weekdays, you need to arrive around 1145 for lunch service, otherwise you'll be stuck waiting 20+ minutes.  There are special deals maybe once a year here, so you'll always be stuck with their semi-high prices.   Overall Great spot for date night or the family or a business meal as long as you come early.  Good quality, consistent food.  Impeccable service.  A+",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=460,3.04,3.66,3.324,3.088,3.412000000000001

We were a party of four and seated almost immediately. Started with 2 mixed drinks while looking at the menu.  Took us a while to get bread but oh well. We ordered and it took about half an hour for our food to arrive with the bread long gone and water nearly empty. Only 2 of the orders arrived but I assumed the other 2 would follow shortly. WRONG. We patiently waited about 15-20 minutes for the other half of our party's food to arrive. No apologies or updates were given. My steak was cool ( even with the waiting, much cooler than expected) and undercooked. I requested medium well and it came medium rare. I attempted to force a few bites down because I NEVER send food back for fear of retribution. Couldn't do it so I requested a different order. Waitress seemed the tiniest bit bothered but she put the order in and I waited an additional 25 minutes for my meal with no water.

Back they come from the chicken with the waitress telling me they have been remade. I eat two of them and as I'm in the middle of eating the third I see two huge chunks of chicken. Did they really remake my wraps or did they just try to pick the chicken out? I'm a strict vegan and for me this is just unacceptable. It's disgusting. I called the waitress over to show her and her reaction was that of annoyance instead of being apologetic. My two Irish friends were both super unimpressed as well.

This is the ONLY thing I crave from their menu!  The place (caution): I lost count of the number of times I've eaten here, and every visit has always been great.

I ordered the Americana Cheeseburger it was DELICIOUS! Instead of fries I ordered a side salad. Everything was really good. My bill was about $15 not too shabby for restaurant food.

584,Ashley C.,"Henderson, NV",14,35,,4.0,2012-07-17,"Last Saturday was lovely and spent in Old Towne Pasadena-Just the little one and I...I do not know the name of the street but there is a parking structure nestled near the Pottery Barn (there is a pizza place right there) Parking is $6 but its really easy to get in and out of and its centrally located. I digress... We walked around a bit and it was more crowded than I expected due to it being nearly 95 degrees that afternoon...We got severely over heated and I was just looking for a place with some air conditioning where we could sit down for a bit. Alas, Cheesecake Factory!! I love this place in general but I have never eaten at this location before. I was afraid there would be a wait (It was about 4:30 pm) but luckily we were seated immediately at one of the 2 seater booths that look out onto Colorado. We truly enjoyed the people watching as we sipped our drinks ( Me: Kim Crawford Savignon Blanc- Her: Lemonade in a kids cup) I really couldnt decide what to eat because it was kind of between lunch and diiner. Finally I decided on the skinnylicious Veggie Burger- When it came out it had mayo on it which I was surprised by since it is the ""skinny"" version but its all good. And the veggie burger was just that....quite good!! It was made with beets and I love love love beets!! Never had a veggie burger made from beets before... I must say though...that the beets gave the burger a strange reddish color and I couldnt help but think that onlookers who did not know it was a veggie burger must have been grossed out as it looked like I was eating very undercooked hamburger. Our waitress was nice; she seemed kinda new but was more than pleasant and even refilled our kids cup with diet coke for me to send us on our way back out to the heat. All in all...good meal, good service, good day...would go back.

Service - still exceptional, although the waiter kind of mixed up our food. I can't blame him because we were a group of ~15 people. Food - After careful examine the menu (since I had plenty of time because some of us were running a little late), I was going for either Garlic Noodles or Thai Noodles. But I didn't like Parmasean cheese so I finally settled on Evelyn's Favorite because I thought since this is someone's favorite, it must be good. (This is off their website) The ingredients were: Penne Tossed with Broccoli, Oven-Dried Tomato, Roasted Eggplant, Peppers, Artichoke, Kalamata Olives, Garlic and Pine Nuts). It was a total mistake!! I mean, if this was cooked properly, it could taste better (Note that I didn't say fantastic, but it could be better). The pasta was dry and hard, meaning that the chef was probably felt too rushed with a big group order and had to drain my pasta early - for that the center was still uncooked. The egg plants were burned (not browned, but BURNED)! Come on chefs, don't treat us customers like we are idiots. Although I couldn't see well under the dark lighting inside the restaurant, and my food just looked like a black/white picture taken from an old camera, I have good taste buds and I could definitely taste the burned egg plants. I was being optimistic and thought, maybe it's just one piece, let me try another one. And it was burned as well. In fact, all the eggplants were burned! The pasta was super oily and not to mention the combination of herbs just made this dish a complete failure. For the price (I think it was $13-ish, and after tips ~$18), it was junk!!

At first I thought it was kind of pricey but the piece of fish was huge! I opted for the miso salmon and it was delicious. It's served on a bed of white rice with special cream sauce and miso reduction and some snow peas. The biggest complaint I have is around the wait. We waited almost 20 minutes for the food.

My friends and I decided on a shopping day in Old Town Pasadena and we were starving, but I really wanted to try something that wasn't as ""chain-y"" as TCF. Sure, there were lots of chain restaurants in the area, but are so many TCF's around the area, so I was hoping for something unique. But they didn't want to walk anymore, and one person who suggested to come here was soon followed by murmurs of agreement, so I had to come in. Looking at the menu, I saw that almost 80% of the items that I wanted to eat could be homemade at home without too much effort. Salads, pastas, even dishes like Shepard's pie and meatloaf were things that I could make, so I really just didn't want to spend money on it, being the cheapo that I was. But I was hungry and didn't care, so I picked something that sounded simple yet delicious: the cashew chicken salad. It was a hot day and I wanted something light yet filling, so I was very satisfied when I got my food. It was the $10 lunch portion, which I expected to be tiny, since it was a ""smaller portion"" of the regular dish. I loved the crispy tortilla chips, crunchy cashews, and the zesty but light peanut vinaigrette over the tender chicken and mixed greens. It turned out to be a great lunch. One thing I really wished though was better service. It wasn't terrible, but I could tell some of the waiters/waitresses were tired of their job or just in a cranky mood.

The wait was longer than their estimated 20 minutes. We were seated at 6:40PM near the door, which was a bit chilly, as people were coming in and out. I would have given this place 3 stars because of the wait and being cold, but since the food was yummy and the service was good, I give it 4 stars! I had not been to a Cheesecake Factory in almost a year and noticed that their Hot Fudge Sundae was about half the size than it usually is. I don't know if it's just at the Pasadena location (since it was my first time here) or if they've downsized their sundae.

It's usually pretty packed during its busy hours on Friday nights and on weekends, but there's practically no wait on a weekday. Between the three girls of our family, we ordered a BBQ Chicken Pizza, a Shrimp Angel Hair Pasta and a slice of Red Velvet Cheesecake. I'm not a pizza person, but I thought the pizza was very good. The crust was sweet and the taste was flavorful. It was great. The pasta, however, was just mediocre. I felt like it was a bit overpriced for just diced tomatoes, some pasta and five jumbo shrimp. And the red velvet cheesecake never fails. I've ordered this every time and sometimes just for to-go! It is a must, but who am I to say anything since it's also the only one I've tried. I'm extremely content with the cheesecake, although it puzzles me that the size of it varies depending on what day you go? (I can't exactly figure it out).  Take advantage of the ""Skinnylicious"" menu, because some of that stuff is good and pretty healthy. It will lessen your guilt when you indulge in your cheesecake. I recommend the Turkey & Avocado Sandwich. The complimentary bread is really good, but especially the brown one. I always ask for seconds.

This place is great when you're just not very picky and are hungry and maybe have some friends or family with you.  Their extensive menu with satiate any appetite (as long as it's a big one), and they have some pretty decor inside.  The waiters all wear white and long aprons -- something out of a culinary school, it would seem like.  The food is pretty much the same if you order the same few plates every time (like I do) and can compare between locations. One thing that did irk me a bit is that at dinner last night, I had ordered a split bubbly with two glasses -- my husband and I are closing escrow on a house and wanted to celebrate -- and after ten minutes, our waitress came by to inform us that they pulled the bottles out of storage and that they ""can put it over ice for us, or did I want it at room temperature?""  Room temperature?  Really?  Has anyone ever requested sparkling at room temp?  A very, very odd inquiry.  I ended up cancelling the bubbly (even if over ice, it would take a little bit longer, and we were both dead tired by that point) and ordering a glass of white wine instead. When we had finished dinner and needed our check, it was a bit difficult to flag our waiter down.  And, when the check was brought to us, the bubbly was still left on the bill, so we had to ask to have it removed. All in all, an okay experience, one that I would expect from a CF.  But last night was a bit frustrating, which shouldn't happen on a night we wanted to celebrate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=380,3.36,3.35,3.472,2.8600000000000003,3.354

And then we waited 20 minutes just to order.  We kept looking out for our waiter and he disappeared and re-appeared just to serve other tables, I think perhaps there was a lack of staff or poor coordination so it may not have been his fault.  The tables here are darker, which made it hard to read the menu, other Cheesecake locations have candles and this is never a problem. Now, the waiter had misunderstood our order even though we repeated it twice to clarify, and when the dish came out, one of our group informed him that the dish was incorrect, he blamed us, claiming that we told him wrong. That is a big no-no for any restaurant. The rest of our party heard it correctly so for this one waiter to claim that WE were wrong when it was HIM, this was totally inappropriate to shift blame to the customer. Also, water should be filled without our having to ask, but we needed to ask a staff after 1 hour of no water-filling and that was annoying. Perhaps this again was a staffing issue.  Poor resource management and/or poor operational systems. For the food, all of our appetizers and entrees including the avocado, corn dogs, pizza, all good.  Didn't have much problem, though it just didn't taste as good as we've had at other locations. Poor service really ruins the whole eating experience.  I have been to other cheesecake factory locations at least 30 times, and always trusted I would be treated well, but this is the first time when I now question whether all Cheesecakes are the same.  This one obviously was below average, but I would probably be willing to give it one more chance, if I had no other choice.  Since I think it may have been a one-off terrible night, I will be a bit more general in this review, but next time I'll be more detailed and specific with manager & staff names.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=500,3.6,3.39,3.516,2.6000000000000005,3.474

I ordered a pizza and my friend had the lettuce wrapped tacos. I didn't like my pizza - it was hard and tasted too salty. My friend liked her tacos so I won't say the food is bad but maybe just didn't make the right choice.  Our waiter was not attentive, hardly came around and when he did he wasn't nice. However, we ended up with a waitress when he left and she was great. Another waiter came over with our bread and he was very nice too. Guess it was a hit or miss!  The highlight of the evening was the cheesecake I ordered. It was the Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake and it was sooooo good. In that moment I wanted to try all of their cheesecakes! I recommend this place but maybe ordering something more eventful than pizza. And definitely recommend it for the sweets!

I came here for Sunday brunch. Pros: We got seated fairly quickly, in less time than they estimated for us. The service was quick, and our waitress was generally very good and friendly and attentive. It was my wife's Birthday and they put the piece of cake that she ordered on a nice decorated plate with her name written on it in chocolate, and they sang Happy Birthday. It was very well done, and that really made her day! My wife liked her whole meal. I had the crab hash, which was very good. The cons: Prices just seem to be going up and up and up at this place. I ordered a small $7 side salad (that should be the price of a large salad!) to have before my meal. What they brought to my table was this small, I mean puny little salad with wilted greens, and the entire salad could fit in the palm of my hand! I'm not kidding, for 7 bucks!  The breakfast potatoes that came with my hash were dreadful! They looked like the cheapest deep fried potatoes that you could buy in the frozen section of a grocery store. They were basically little grease sponges! They were so greasy that they were translucent because of all the grease! And when you pressed on one, all the oil would ooze out! And those were the ""good"" pieces of potato! The rest were greasy little hard crunchy bottom-of -the -barrel crumbs that looked like they scraped off the grill just to make it look like they were giving you more pieces, but they were not even edible! And about half the potatoes were like that! I asked the server that brought me the potatoes if that was how the potatoes normally are, or if there was something wrong with my particular serving, and he laughed and said yep, that's how they normally are! The bagel I had was not fresh at all! It tasted like it was old and had been sitting around a while, borderlined stale. Then when were were paying our check, we paid for part of it with a gift card. We gave the waitress the card, and she comes back saying the card  was no good and brought  us a bill for the rest of the meal. And said we could call the company and find out why it didn't work , etc., etc. I knew the gift card was good so I told here to please try it again. So she goes back and tries it again and the card worked this time because she  punched in the numbers by hand.

156,Esther W.,"Carlsbad, CA",208,183,384.0,5.0,2014-06-28,"Okay, so I figure it's time to write a review on the Cheesecake factory, and the reviews here on yelp are sort of random. This is 5 stars because of the food and only the foos. Yes lines can be long, but i've been there close to Saturday midnight and Sunday evening, and we were seated right away (party less than 4).  Yes your waiter can be a bit of an ass. One waiter actually checked up on us, another time they sort of ignored us, but it didn't bother me. All the tables around us were full, and they kept filling up, so I can understand it can be a little hectic. But there is also amazing service, very fast with the bread (just request the black bread dammit) and helpful with selection. Hell they're also great to call- I lost an item and the front desk was so sweet about it! Anyways, I won't let a bit of bad service get in the way of the 5 stars-- because the food is freaking amazing! This is a great spot for dinner or lunch, the portions are huge, appetizer and entree alike, and the cheesecake makes for a great slice!  An entree I highly recommend is the eggplant burger. Yes you heard me, eggplant. If you've had enough burgers as I have, bison or angus, it's definitely nice to eat something else. The Cheesecake Factory's eggplant burger is definitely a unique treat. It's a huge burger, extremely savory and fulfilling. The side of fries is also very very generously portioned. Instantly loved! For sides, I've tasted the quesadillas, nacho chips with buffalo (?) chicken and the sweet potato fries. The chips platter was insanely huge, definitely worth it if you just want to snack with another person. It was extremely savory, you get chicken, salsa, guac, and all the cheese ever. The quesadillas were a bit small/thin, but nevertheless tasty. And lastly the sweet potato fries... No regrets. It was another huge plate of just sweet potato fries. Top notch, soft, fresh, salty and sweet, doesn't taste that oily. And lastly for the Cheesecake I taste: the something something Tuxedo cheesecake. Hahah I forgot the name oops, but I was already hooked on the fact it was called Tuxedo! It was chocolate, vanilla, and more chocolate!

If you want to go for a romantic dinner i suggest another one because this one is more for everyone that is tired of walking blocks and blocks and shopping around. it gets packed but they are very fast in attending. when i walked in for my birthday i thought they were at least going to take 30 min because the waiting area was super packed. when i asked how long was the wait they said 3 min. i was a little critical about it, but in like 2 min they told us our table was ready. i was surprised. the food was great and the service as well. it was just really really packed. once we were seated they did take a while to take our order but we didn't mind since we didn't know what we wanted.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=400,3.6,3.39,3.5,3.504,3.474

We sat down and had a great view of Fair Oaks from our table. We all were pretty hungry and they gave us fresh bread that was really good. The brown bread is amazing! When our food arrived it all had great presentation and was large portions. I ordered the chinese chicken salad and that was very filling and tasty, with nice zesty dressing. My girlfriend ordered sausage and ricotta flat bread, she liked that as well and it came out on a cutting board. Her parents ordered pasta dishes one was shrimp scampi and the other was garlic farfalle chicken pasta. They both loved it and said that it had great flavor.

HE was gracious and offered to take our order and give it to our real server. Then our real server popped up and had the most uncomfortable gaze towards me that makes it seem like he was upset that I flagged someone else down? Not my problem. I give a nervous laugh and begin ordering a wine. He does not ask for an ID even though I begin to reach for my wallet automatically. I ask, don't you need to check my ID? He gives his uncomfortable gaze again and says sure and doesn't really look at it.  Food comes and my bistro shrimp pasta has major lemony taste. It's overpowering. My friend's rice was undercooked.

There was so sort of greasy stain or sauce or something on the outside of my glass. That's just gross. Do they not clean their glasses?? The bread basket came and the wheat bread was as good as I remembered it to be. The food came and my potatoes were super crispy to the point I feel they were more burnt than anything. My husband loves the extra extra crispy so he was happy eating them. My brioche sandwich was just okay. The cheese was not all melty, the bacon was not crispy and it was more fat than anything. The ham flavor was just so so. Bummed about the breakfast sandwich. Will not be ordering that item.  Super noisy today and there were a few screaming kids to add to the meal.

You are there for convenience, not for top-notch dining experience. These are not homemade cheesecakes so don't expect anything gourmet or grand. These are mass-produced desserts so I recommend going for the safe picks instead of going crazy with the selection and then get disappointed later. Because they'll taste like SUGAR. None of the real thing. The one cheesecake that stood out though was Lemoncello. Then their pumpkin pecan cheesecake was a safe bet. I wouldn't recommend their lunch or other food selection either.

I was really surprised and disappointed that the hostess let my mother and I walk out of the restaurant after we refused to wait 20 minutes for a booth when multiple booths were open. We went to Cheesecake Factory for an early dinner at about 6:00 and we got right in and were shown to a table with one bench seat and one chair. My mother is 67 with a bad back and while I am half her age, I had also recently injured my back and need more support than a cane backed chair. Before accepting the table, we asked if we could instead have one of the two-top mini booths 10 feet away. 2 of the 3 mini booths were open. The hostess (who seemed like she was in training) informed us that the waitstaff for that area wasn't in yet and it would likely be a 20 minute wait, but that we could go back up to the hostess desk and check. So we went back up front (where I also saw more booths open) and we were told that it would be a 20 minute wait for a booth. Since that was absolutely ridiculous, we walked out.   I was shocked and annoyed and the next time someone suggests eating at Cheesecake Factory, I will suggest elsewhere.

120,Vic C.,"Duarte, CA",107,2377,8717.0,3.0,2015-02-20,"What has happened to Cheesecake Factory? I have dined at this location here and there when I was in high school (that was 10-15 years ago). But have dined at other Cheesecake Factory locations over the years and am sad to see that the food quality has gone down hill within the last few years. Anyways, on my most recent visit to this location (yesterday afternoon around 2 pm for a late light lunch), my husband and I were seated at a small table near the kitchen. These are the items we ordered: Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls, $10.95 prior to tax- My husband wanted something light since he had a big (late) breakfast and decided upon these spring rolls. I had low expectations for these spring rolls because with an American restaurant making spring rolls, I just had a feeling they wouldn't be good. And well, my suspicions were correct. These 3 rolls (pretty expensive for 3) were poorly wrapped and the wrong type of noodles were used in them. Also these summer rolls are supposed to have shrimp. Only one roll had 1 shrimp and the other 2 had none. I did like the peanut flavored sauce and the sweet chili sauce that came with the rolls though (these are the same sauces that come with the Thai Lettuce Wraps, which my husband should have ordered in the first place because that actually taste good, although it is not a light appetizer). Luau Salad (Lunch portion), $10.95 prior to tax- The lunch portion size (you can order lunch portions until 5 pm) is actually a good size for one person (I shared part of my salad with my husband). The presentation of this salad was pretty. It comes with 2 large fried won ton pieces. It isn't exactly healthy so I didn't finish it.  Whenever I order a salad, I always order for the dressing to be on the side. In this salad, there are pieces of mango, cucumber slices, sliced bell peppers, green beans, macadamia nuts and sesame seeds. The sweetness of the mango was good enough that this salad didn't need the dressing (I had a little of the dressing and it does go well with the salad, just in case you are someone who just has to have dressing on your salad). I love the different textures, flavors and crunch. Strawberry Lemonade, $3.95 prior to tax- This lemonade was pretty bad. The lemonade tasted too sour and tasted as if rotten fruit was made with it. When we got a 2nd glass, it still had the same taste. The reason being was that our server just ladled out the drink from a large container that was already premade (so our 1st glass wouldn't taste any different from the 2nd until someone makes a new batch... but I bet it will still taste the same).  ------------------------------ (Total= $34.95 after tax and tip)  Service was just average and really could have been better attentive (especially it being in the late afternoon when the restaurant was not busy).

Its is Centrally located in the heart of Oldtown Pasadena where the hustle and bustle of shoppers and diners crowd the character filled streets. Food:  With emphasis on ""value and portion,"" Cheesecake Factory does not fall short. Great for large groups. Trick is to order for the table. Ala-carte style. You'll be able to try everything. Everything is made to order. Tastes great. (salt really does wonders) something for every craving. Huge menu. They recently revived their menu. Pretty sad to see fettuccini and sun-dried tomatoes go.  Service: We've had many servers in the past but our latest would probably be the greatest. Nicky (not sure of the spelling) was one of the reasons i'm writing this review. She is the Filipino lady that was assigned to our table. Need i mention she is probably the sweetest most sincere server we have ever come across. Food came out great. She was very attentive and made sure our dining experience was great.

We asked the hostess what was up after waiting the inital 20 minites and I was told out name had already been called which was a blatant lie as we were sitting directly infront of the hostess table and heard and saw everyone that was called. The hostess made excuses and asked us to wait another 20 minutes. After that 20 minutes went by I asked about a table that had not been cleaned or used for like 15 minutes. The hostess seemed astonished that she had not thought of that and had the table cleared for us. The waitress seemed absolutely scatter brained and started arguing with my mother about the selections on the menu and possible substitutions. The food took another half an hour to come out and by that time we were full of bread. The staff seemed frustrated and streched thin and well that makes for shitty service.

We got sat at a table in the main dining room right under the air conditioning vent. I asked if we could move to the table a few feet away that wasn't directly under the vent. Our server made a comment how he was so hot and that this was the best he could do. Put off and clearly unsettled, he finally gave in and ""let us"" move showing it bothered him that we would no longer be in his section. I might add, that if u want to consider being a ""fine dining"" restaurant, its the little things that make your experience exceptional. At this point, we are all bothered. The next server came, a girl, who seemed nice but really cared about her job. She cared more about carding me (26) my mom (55) and dad (49) than being down to earth and personable. I was very put off by this, I find it disrespectful to ask the clearly older adults for their ID's. She even craned her neck around to make sure I was who my ID said I was even though I pulled my card right out of my ID slip of my wallet. Now I get it, I've worked at yard house and understand where you are getting at with service, but its clearly obvious you are force feeding us the same detailed description of an appetizer, entree and dessert. I would rather have someone wait on us that is going to have somewhat of a pulse, a personality. Dinner was good, I got the chicken madiera (which is pronounced ma-dare-ah) my server corrected me.... Anyways, the cheesecake factory gets two stars because the servers are so drilled to be perfect that they forgot what true service is. The little things, the personable behavior, the light connections made with the guest. They fall short because they care so much about ""guest perception"" that they lose the fundamentals. They try so hard to ""be perfect"" and look, they have 3 stars.

The restaurant was a mirror image of the city that night: busy and chaotic.  Complimentary breads (french and squaw?) are served warm and with pats of butter. We ordered: - AVOCADO EGGROLL  Seriously. This is the best appetizer here. It sounds grossly ick but don't knock it 'til you've tried it. The sweet tamarind sauce is such a winner here. - STEAK DIANE AND SHRIMP SCAMPI Sis said the steak was nice and tender (prepared medium plus). The mashed potatoes were more like smashed potatoes. - SHRIMP SCAMPI AND CHICKEN MADEIRA The chicken madeira is smothered with mozzarella and a beautiful sweet dark madeira wine sauce. The shrimp scampi is pretty yums as well. The breaded large shrimp is pan fried and then covered in this delicious garlic sauce. I wish they'd leave out the breading as it becomes a bit gummy/thick after it sits in the sauce too long. - MANGO KEY LIME CHEESECAKE Nice and tart. I'm not sure if this is a new item. Make sure to ask for extra whip cream.  I had whispered to the waitress before the meal that it was sis' bday. She said they only give out a free sundae (?) or something? It was loud in the restaurant so maybe I misheard. I told her that would be great but I'd like to order a slice of cheesecake (that I would pay for). We didn't get the free sundae but did appreciated the decorated cheesecake plate and the waitresses singing happy birthday to sis.

This very generous serving of Shrimp and Chicken Sautéed with Onions, Tomato and Peppers in a spicy cajun sauce really hit my cravings for tonight, I love how the spices did not over power each other giving this dish a nice balance between heat, flavor and spice. Served on top of Linguini pasta, this dish will sure fill you up! It's really good! When you are at the Cheesecake Factory - you MUST save room for dessert! A slice of Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake for my friend and a slice of the Original Cheesecake for me! ""Sharing is caring"" we split up our cheesecakes so that we could both have a taste of this sinfully delicious slices! Absolutely divine!

First we were denied the ability to purchase alcoholic beverages simply because of the origin of  our ID's all 3 of us being from Guatemala. This is the first time we have ever been denied the right to consume alcohol because of the origin of our ID's we are all over the age of 21 and I have had no issue before anywhere proving my age with my ID from  my country Guatemala. After the waiter had denied our ID's to validate our age  we asked for a Manager which also rudely confirmed the same and that it's the law that they don't accept ID's from the country of Guatemala to confirm legal age to drink. Even after the manager pointed out in a very rude way simply cause we were ""Guatemalns"" we still were planing on having dinner. After he just left and just left us there for 20 mins with no follow up no waiter to come and assist us so we just took of and left. I ask to speak to him again before we left, at no time we had an apology from him, and still was really rude. I don't think someone before made us felt that bad and that ""excluded"" just cause of the fact of our origins...

177,Bo L.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,288,333.0,1.0,2015-09-07,"READ THIS 1ST (you can read the rest if you want or not. It doesn't matter. It's not like Yelp pays me to write.)  I remember seeing this food documentary that showed how huge food companies try to make their food as sweet as possible so that it tastes good and is addicting. That is what I feel The Cheesecake Factory is. It's use of cheap overly used sugar keeps you coming back for more.  If you come here, you're only wasting your own time and money.  REST OF THE REVIEW BELOW: 1st Visit (take out): For take out I got a regular cheesecake and key lime cheesecake. Both were just under $9. They were both too sweet and too rich. They have a thick layer of cream cheese and have hardly any crust. My favorite part is the crust! Really a disappointment and WAAY overpriced for the quality you get and it's only 1 slice. I'd rather buy a whole pie or cake for just a few bucks more.  2nd Visit (dine in, but got no service): Why do people like this place??? I mean really. There are so many other better places to choose from.  DINING IN: Here's what happened: I sat down, was served bread and was left alone for 20 minutes. WTF? I never had this happen to me at a restaurant before. I even asked another waiter about the problem and still no one came. I didn't want to waste my time anymore so I left.  A Comment on the Menu: While I was waiting for 20 minutes I was looking over the menu and it's ALL American-ized food. Burgers, pasta, and typical breakfast & sides. The reason I'm pointing this out is because if you really want good food, in my experience, I would recommend going to a restaurant that specializes in a particular type of food, meaning if you want a particular type of dish then you should go to an Italian, Southern, or Asian restaurant. The Cheesecake Factory is like a one-stop-shop for all your food needs, which is my theory why people who can't make up their minds eat here. Next time say to yourself, ""Hey, I never had [Indian/Spanish/Peruvian/Vegan] food. Let's go there instead."" 3rd Visit (dine in): - Beet salad = slightly on the sweet side. Great combo of flavors. The 2 red and purple beets gave it a meaty texture. Pecans added crunch, but they should not have been candied pecans. Baby arugula added a smooth, mellow vibe. Cheese was creamy and mellowed out the overly sweet notes. Overall, too sweet. 3/5 - Spicy Cashew Chicken = way too sweet. Tasted like they chose a teriyaki sauce that had the most amount of corn syrup. It wasn't spicy at all. I assume it's because it's cheaper to pay for corn syrup than it is to pay for spices. I couldn't finish it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=140,3.52,3.68,3.548,2.5640000000000005,3.6160000000000005

416,E G.,"Chino Hills, CA",6,48,17.0,2.0,2015-11-20,"Just when I had a good streak.... ok I have good reasons for this particular one. Just to be clear, I actually like cheesecake factory. For a chain restaurant it's pretty good. Food, drinks, service are decent and I do have a special place in my heart for this chain. I would be giving the cheesecake factories I've been to at least 4 stars.... just not this location. Here's why.  Food. The taste of everything overall wasn't as good as the others. Example, I ordered the ribeye with fries, the steak itself was cooked to my liking, so bonus points. But it was too salty, and I do have a salty pallet and don't mind salty things. But in this case it was too salty, and you know it is when a guy who likes salty things says so. When I got the fries, I actually in my mind, and verbally, said ""noooooo."" Like Luke Skywalker finding out Vader is his father nooo. Because the fries changed. Not sure if it's this location, or they changed everywhere, but the fries are no longer skinny and crispy. They are the fat fries that everyone serves. Not that I have anything against fat fries, they are still good, but the skinny fries are what made them unique because not many places have them. It sounds like a personal gripe, but I wouldn't have mind if they tasted good.... not really. They tasted they've been sitting under the heat lamp for a while.  They gave me a couple onion rings with it, which was nice, but most of it was batter. How much, like a legit inch of it. If you like that kind of thing, hey go it, but i like tasting some of my onion in my onion rings. If there is too much batter it's not balanced and the flavor is too overpowering. Also one other minor gripe on food, depending if you want to view this as one or not, the the ketchup taste like one of those knock off want to be ketsup. You know when Mr. Burns was at the grocery store and couldn't pick between the two bottles... yeah it was like that. It could be home made, idk, but if it is.... it needs work. With that being said, I would have given this a 3 star if it weren't for 1 other factor.... the service. I read other reviews and yes service here sucks. The waiters and waitresses were nice don't get me wrong, but they sucked on everything else. They checked up on us once after our food came out, and only because we looked depressed and upset. Because of that we didn't get refills on drinks, extra sauces we wanted, extra plates, etc. I think the manager checked up on us also, but also only because we had our heads down and looked disapointed. I was gonna say because we came during closing time, so I would understand if they wanted to pack up or they were just tired. But after seeing what other people said.... yeah it's not just me.  Again, I actually like this chain, but this one really needs work. I'm willing to give it another shot in the future, just be aware this wouldn't be my first pick as of now. With being in downtown pasadena surrounded by other good places, it's really hard to pick this place if i know i can get better on food and service. 2 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=400,3.2,3.63,3.52,2.6320000000000006,3.458

This is one of many restaurants in the vicinity. We were seated immediately. We got our drinks, and the delicious dark brown bread. I ordered the filet mignon, with a size of broccoli. My meal was so so. I did not like how the filet mignon tasted. It seemed a bit too salted, and the cut was not right. There is not much to expect from the taste of broccoli, other than the Parmesan cheese I requested on top added a nice taste to it. The service was alright, but they need to prepare their filet mignon better. I asked for rare, but I got more of a medium/well. I never eat steak in any way other than rare.

I came here with a party of 8, and the wait was atrocious. They quoted us around hour, it ended up being two..... I wasn't feeling adventurous so I just got the Classic Burger with cheddar cheese. It's a typical burger with lettuce, tomato, grilled onion, and sauce served with a side of French fries. Large portioned and juicy, not a bad choice for those not in the mood for pasta or anything else. I also stole a bit of my friends steak Diane with shrimp scampi with angel hair pasta substituted for the mashed potatoes. The steak was juicy and tender and the shrimp scampi was full of flavor, not too salty. For dessert we decided on a chocoate mousse cheesecake. Now normally I'm not a fan of cheesecake at all, but holy crap the chocolate mousse was the perfect way to end the meal. Food is a solid 4 stars, but I have to subtract a star for the absurd wait time.

It is not surprising to see the crowd of waiting people go out the door here, especially at dinner time. It is pretty crazy, especially considering how much seating they have available inside. It is a large restaurant! Parking is either street parking or one of the public parking lots; the one I usually park at is just a block away on Green. The last time I came here, I was with JC and we were seated at a table on the Fair Oaks side, with large windows letting in a ton of natural light. My favourite part about coming to The Cheesecake Factory is their complimentary bread! I usually always love white bread more than brown bread, but this place is the exception. Both breads are delicious, but there is something extra addicting about the brown bread. So good! My friend ordered an omelette with potatoes and even more brown bread! I don't remember which omelette she got but she liked it. I just ate a few of her potatoes and that was it. I ordered their BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad: Avocado, Tomato, Grilled Corn, Black Beans, Cucumber and Romaine All Tossed with Our Barbeque Ranch Dressing; Topped with Lots of Crispy Fried Onion Strings for Crunch. It was really good! Next time I would get it without black beans, but I liked everything else. I really liked that they added onion strings to the salad, yum! The portion sizes here are large so I had enough salad leftover to bring home. Combine that with the leftover bread from our second basket and I had enough for another meal.

I came here with a client from work and my friends ordered a harvest salad that comes with some type of special dressing they kept telling her that it wasn't a special dressing. It was an awkward moment between the manager & her. Typically the customer is always right but not here. So tonight my daughter turned 11months and we decided to come here now granted it was 9pm and they close at 11pm. I typically order the Louisiana chicken pasta (never lets me down) but i tried something new the zesty lemon chicken which comes with mashed potatoes and carrots. My plate comes and it LOOKS delicious the chicken www great moist and tender the mashed potatoes were dry. Almost as if it is the last bath for the night and they aren't making any fresh. I send them back and ask for green beans. The green beans come out and they are burnt there is a puddle of brown oil at the bottom of the plate. There was literally like charcoal flakes on the plate. So the waiter who I must say was amazing went to get the manager. She came over and asked what I was having and I told her my issues with the dry cold mashed potatoes and now the burnt ass oily green beans. She persisted to tell me ""that's how we cook our green beans""  so you mean to tell me you purposely browned this oil and made sure they were burnt with no flavor other than hydrogenated oil. That was done on PURPOSE. B#%^ please quit diffusing responsibility and own up to the fact that this is wrong. I subconsciously felt that she thought because we were black we wanted our mean competed but that is my own personal feeling. So I asked her to taste them she looked at me like I was asking her to drink polyjuice potion. So you will serve these green beans but won't eat them  *mental note made* so I asked her ""are your green beans cooked in oil or butter"" my thought process was if the skillet was too hot the butter would brown hence for the murky substance at the bottom of the plate. Logically speaking. She leaves the table and returns and says ""Oil"" so now I'm like that's some dirty dark oil to be cooking my green beans in. She apologizes ""for me expecting something different"" which is a slap in the face offers us a dessert which I turn down and dismissed her. Her attitude was that of woman who has been beat up by life and I'm just another problem. She seemed bothered that I was bothered by my food presentation. Lady this is your JOB to manage this restaurant fix complaints.

This to me is the least crowded location. Plus they have been the most consistent with food and drinks. Point and case. I've order the vegan salad and the Georgia peach from all locations. At the Americana I was only provided one type of dressing for my salad, the second time.I met friends there I was given 2. At Westfield Arcadia I asked how many dressings am I getting with this salad and the waitress told me 3.  But Pasadena they have always consistently given me 2. Not a huge deal except when I got three ot sure tasted like i got double dressing of the same kind. On to my drink. I have to say I do love Grey Goose mainly because I don't get hangovers from drinking it. I'm a lightweight to begin with so one good drink is all I need to be feeling no pain. Well you would hope that when you ask for Grey Goose you would get it. Didn't happen for sure at the Americana but was told it was but my bill didn't reflect it.... worse yet I had a hangover the next day. Besides being consistent with the above mentioned this location has been pretty consistent with other food items like their bang bang shrimp and chicken, providing a bread basket, their chicken and biscuits, stuffed mushrooms, crab cakes, Madera chicken and of course their desserts.

I agree that not everyone should be allowed to just order buffalo wings without having earned that right by proving their skill at nostalgic games from far better days. The only complaint that I had was that it seemed a bit counter intuitive to have to put on your skates before being allowed into the elevator which took you to the second level rink but once I got up there and saw just how awesome the light show and fog machines were, it made it all worth the falls and minor bruises. The fact that you could either exit the venue through the (well designed and aesthetically pleasing) front door or water slide located on the balcony just goes to show you how far ahead this place is to other similar establishments.

I supervise them while they play with forks and knives!  LOL j/k).  Honestly, compared to other cheesecake factory's, our waitress at this location was great, she brought out the food quickly, she brought our more bread when I mentioned that my little one only likes their bread and on top of great service, their food is great!!

When we got the manager over a second time and told her all that had gone wrong, all she could say was basically ""we're really busy right now"" and ""what would you like me to do"".  When we said they should comp us our meals given the horrible service and food, she had the audacity to say she couldn't do that because she hadn't seen two of the meals.  So they made us pay for two of our four meals despite them all being terrible.

The server didn't even noticed. When we pointed it out to the server, she took it back in the kitchen and after 5 minutes served us the same bowl without the pasta. She didn't notice that my husband had left a piece of shell in one of the corners and the same piece was there when she brought it back. Very disappointing. My husband ordered a Tuscan chicken that was supposed to be less then 590 calories and the chicken was swimming in olive oil. He had the same dish before and it definitely didn't appear to be that way. My son ordered chicken Marsala and he found a carrot together with the mushrooms. Don't know how it ended up there.

The portions are great, love the variety of flavors/types of food, great desserts of course. The restaurants always have great locations too, like this one which is in the heart of Old Town Pasadena.  I've been noticing for some time now that the busyness of the place affects the service. Wait times are long and the servers run from table to table. Because of this, I've been calling for pickup to just get the food. Unfortunately, the pick up option convenience is now getting worse.  When I called in the food, they told me 20 mins and it'd be ready. I got there 25 mins later and paid, but my food wasn't ready. There were three ""Door Dash"" guys in front of me waiting for their food. Long story short, I waited for another 25 mins (and after asking the worker twice to look into my order).

209,cyndi t.,"Alhambra, CA",3,72,8.0,1.0,2016-12-03,"The manager that runs this place is full of shit. We ask for double servings of spicy chicken on our nachos and as the manager expedite she only gave us a serving of chicken while claiming she gave us two. She said for each serving of chicken she gives 7 oz per serving. Since we ask for more chicken shouldn't she give us 14 oz of chicken yet when we got our nachos we got maybe at most 4 oz. She tried arguing with us on how they measure every amount of meat that they serve. Yet, out of her own good heart she decides to not charge us for the chicken we order and that she promise for another 7 oz of chicken. As we got the extra chicken we ask for she probably only gave us another 3 oz. I'm pretty sure we got less than 14 oz of chicken (more like 8 oz total that after she promise another serving of chicken) she dared charge us another $3. I don't mind paying for what I ordered but how would you feel if someone short change you. Such an unprofessional manager she argue with us and lied to our faces saying that she put double servings yet she didn't. I used to plan for meal servings and I guarantee you that we had at most one serving of chicken (7oz). To be fair if the manager was really sure of the serving size why not bring out the scale and if you are right I will pay for what I eat. If your wrong then you should apologize and not charge for the extra chicken.  We also ordered the egg roll sampler which was great because you get to try four different egg rolls. Avocado was the best but at the same time it hard to mess up with Avocado egg roll. It also hard to mess up with nachos.  If you are planning on cutting short on meat portions maybe you shouldn't tell people about the exact amount of oz you serve for your customer. As a scientist, we do conversion and weigh things on scale everything so I know I didn't get what I paid for. I been to this location before and I ordered the nachos and this was the first time I had such a bad experience. All it takes is just that one bad experience.  The nachos taste delicious but after that encounter with the manager and server they made me feel unpleasant and uncomfortable. I hate it when people straight up lied to my face.  Let's talk about customer service at this location. We had to flag our waitress 3 times to get their attention to get water or any sort of service. On the check they ask for 22% tip yet they didn't really serve us or ever once check back on us. How dare you ask us or demand us for tips when you didn't even do your job. This was at 5pm when there's many empty seats and it not like they were busy.  Another thing was when we ordered a key lime cheesecake to go the cheesecake tasted pretty old and stale.

He ordered a Cesar salad and I ordered a French country salad and added salmon to it. The salads took forever to come out and once they did, I asked the food runner what the hold up was and he explained that the first piece of fish was overly cooked so they had to fire it up again. Anyway, we had waited for so long as this point that I was already beyond annoyed. Then I hungrily dug into my salad and omg it was AWFUL!!! Omg awful so bad I spit out the super salty beet into my napkin. I let the server know it was gross when she checked on us and that I had waited forever on food already and so she had the manager come over. The manager was a lady named Loretta and she was WONDERFUL. I was so damn pissed and disappointment by the wait and the salad but she was soooo cool and understanding and comforting. She took the salad off the check and offered to bring out anything that sounded good to me. I thought about it and was over the idea of eating anything else but in the end I left pleased and impressed that Loretta handled the situation and my crappy attitude like a true professional. She's an exemplary manager and truly truly truly made the difference in my experience. The check was less than 30 bucks so it wasn't the money but it was her willingness and true care to make sure the guest leaves happy. No questions asked Cheesecake Factory Pasadena is lucky to have a lady like Loretta on their management team because had the situation been dealt with in another manner I can assure you I would've left pissed and left 1 star.

I wanted to ask to move but we sat there... waiting...waiting... waiting. Finally, being that it was so late I figured we could grab another booth in a warmer area, I got up and moved to the same size booth with my wife.  All of the sudden within minutes the host shows up telling me ""this section is closed"". I asked him to get the manager and he went off to get her.  He came back and said she was too busy with an employee right now.  He offered to move us to another booth and I reluctantly excepted.  There we sat waiting again. The place seemed to have enough staff to run a good operation but the only one's who se med to be working hard were the servers.  I have worked in this business 20 years and I work in what I would call the best restaurants in Pasadena if not Southern California.  Maybe I'm bias but I usually way over tip and truly enjoy good service.  Mind you the manager still hadn't come to my table. We finally ordered and at this point I just wanted to leave.  The food finally showed up and they placed a burger in front of me I would even feed to my dog. The bun was made from that brown bread with the oatmeal on the outside and i pretty much choked just looking at it. I could basically smell how dry it tasted.  I showed the waitress and she even agreed it usually comes out on a sourdough baguette.  I gave it back to her and when it returned it had obviously been sloppily re-stacked on the sourdough bread.  A slimy tomato was hanging out the side and there was a new slice of cheese thrown in there. (Not even melted). By this time the meet was cold after one bite I had had enough.  I told the server upon her asking me, ""I don't want this"". She said she'd make sure it was taken off the bill.  All of the sudden a manager shows up and states, "" I understand you had an issue with a burger?"" I told him I had asked to see a manager about an hour ago and I was told they were too busy.  I also told him their is nothing he could say to me to change the impression I got from this Cheescake Factory.  It amazes me that people eat here.  It is amateur at best.  There is no sincerity and everyone follows protocol like robots.  I should ha e gone to Coco's which was one of our options at 9:40pm.  If you're open until 11pm you should act like it.  I will never step foot in another Cheesecake Factory in all my life.  I feel sorry for the servers too it's a shame because to be honest the potential is their just not the compassion for wanting it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=160,3.0,3.11,3.34,2.052,3.066

64,Lore D.,"Glendale, CA",6,51,,3.0,2017-05-05,"It's a long story, but Hubs and I ended up with $100.00 worth of gift certificates to the Cheesecake Factory. Hence, the following review. Every store in this chain has seemed overly ""grand"" IMHO, and this one is no exception.  The aftetnoon we lunched there we witnessed no less than three birthday parties. This is clearly a popular spot for the office workers of Old Town.  We were seated quickly in a nice cozy booth. Our server was professional and efficient. Hubs and I were confused by the three (3) menus with their numerous and often redundant choices. I found the caloric values of the dishes to be discouraging and off-putting, to say the least. I don't want to be told that the fish and chips is 1800 calories. I don't want a guilt trip or a Weight Watchers lecture from a restaurant whose stock-in-trade is cheesecake, for crying out loud.  WTF is this anyway? Might as well have a disclsimer saying ""welcome fatsos, to our fattening emporium of fatty fatness,  and now for a very special episode of ""My 600 lb Life"" We started with the famous avocado egg rolls, which were amazing and disappeared quickly. Hubs ordered the Seared Ahi plate, which was fundamentally the same thing as my Tuna Tataki salad. Both dishes were en pointe, tasty and surprisingly filling, considering the relative lowness of their respective caloric values.  Both entrees were priced around $20.00, and with our gift certificates,  were an even better value at free. At this point in the meal, our server went on break. The guy covering for her was pretty douchey. I didn't appreciate him trying to take our bread away. By all means, clear our table but first ask if we're done with something before you just yank it away. Manners! You know how I love me some bread. Douchey substitute server also delivered my Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake  without a fresh, clean fork. Or any fork for that matter. Lucky for me that I still had a clean spoon left. Hubs used his remaining fork to help me polish off the dessert, which was creamy, dense, and luscious as cheesecake should be. I love me some cheesecake. Sigh. In all, the food was very, very good, albeit somewhat expensive, despite not having ordered any adult beverages.

This time I ordered a couple things off of the ""skinnylicious"" menu. They were out of the grilled artichoke that I wanted.  I got the endive salad and the ahi tartare. Both were pretty good. They were off of the small plates menu but they were very small. And for $7-8 each I thought they were a bit on the expensive side for what they were. But they did taste pretty good.  The service was quite slow. It took longer than normal for our food to come out and they also forgot things when they brought out our food. My mom's tacos were missing the crema that comes on the side. I ordered my dressing on the side and they had to bring that separate as well. It just felt a little disorganized.

48,Crystlhrt M.,"La Canada Flintridge, CA",33,42,7.0,2.0,2017-05-22,"I picked Cheesecake Factory for a milestone birthday dinner last night with friends. I'm really sad about my choice.  It started with trying to make a reservation for 6pm on Sunday. I was curtly told I needed to call  back for a same day reservation, advance reservations are not made for Saturday/Sunday. I called back on Sunday as directed - about 11:30am. I was then told they only take reservations during the first hour. When I asked the hostess on the phone where I could find that information (on the website, etc.), she was confused, then flustered, then, being asked again, she said she was new and didn't know.  We had a mix-up of some kind on being called to our table. The cell phone was rung, then we were sent back to the bar for another 10 minutes. We'd already closed our bar tab, I'm not sure what the mix-up was, since I was the birthday girl, I didn't get involved. I was just glad our spots were still available. Overall, our wait was just over the quoted 30-40 minutes.  After a very long delay (shorthanded???), our table-ordered cocktails arrived - after the hot appetizers and my martini included an eyelash or similar. (It didn't have mascara on it, so it didn't come from any of us.) The wait for drinks, including the replacement, was quite long and without explanation. The only drink our server was on top of, was coffee for one of us. A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT was that, even with the extensive menu, it was a challenge to find something for one of our group that has serious food allergies. No potatoes beyond french fries without dairy?!?!? We were told the smashed potatoes contained sour cream, and there is no baked potato option. Broccoli is great - but not exactly an indulgement.  The final straw was that at the end of our meal, we were approached by a previously-unseen employee, all in black, who abruptly asked ""Do you need something else?"" as though we were in the way. We were actually waiting for the additional ""To Go"" food one of us ordered as well as our packed up leftovers. Our actual server had nicely offered to keep them together in back until we were finished and ready to go. The employee was told why were waiting, he took off before we'd finished getting the words out and then returned and essentially through 8 bags of food at us. Talk about a sour taste being left. :(  That final exchange - his tacky, disrespectful approach to us after we spent close to $100 each, inspired this review.

Tender Greens doesn't even charge that much for their Tuna Niçoise salad.  I ordered the skinnyliscious veggie burger. It came with a side salad. The side salad was only lettuce and tasted like chemicals. I immediately spit it out. I proceeded to eat the burger. It was ok.

Maybe he didn't want to get in trouble with management for this huge mistake that was entirely his fault, so he doesn't offer to have a manager come and fix it. His apology should suffice right? No. It doesn't because I already waited a half hour for my food and then I had to sit in store and wait another 15 minutes to receive the food I was originally coming to simply PICK UP.

Then their appetizer crab cake balls (forgot the name) quickly became a routine favorite. While on disability some months back, I tried their Philly Cheesesteak and again, delish! It's like this place can do no wrong food wise.  Recently I took another visit and got their CA Cheesesteak. I had to make some changes because I'm picky and oooo weeee, again, delish! Not a fan of cheese sauce so I substituted for garlic mayo. Because I love cheese, I asked for extra cheese. The sandwich was delivered to the table looking ooey and gooey and I was too happy! A side of bleu cheese dressing for my french fries and I was SET for dinner!  Our waiter, I think his name was Ray, at least that's what my friend kept calling him lol, was fantastic!! He showed much patience with our indecisiveness and substitutions, then he showed his sense of humor as well. He was great. We couldn't wait to give him a 20% tip.

Your supposed to get a whole evolution of flavor and mouth feel out of a taco impossible since you had to take most of it out with a fork that was badly bent in my case. I have never had a street or truck taco that was such a joke. Attractive as it all was flavor counts too. The rice served with it was apparently drizzled with 40wt motor oil. I know what that smells like having an antique car. It made me ill. I never had this kind of atrocity at any other location. I had a great experience three times in a row at the one in Cucamonga.

Our waiter wasn't around after the food was ordered (he seemed to get a lot of tables all at once) and we didn't feel like going to the hassle of sending them back. This was not a bad experience , just not the best we've had at a restaurant we've grown to love in part because of their consistency.   Update: wow-brunch menu is amazing. The brûléed french toast is a must!!! Crispy on the outside and tasty on the inside with a buttery syrup. The avacado toast is lovely-the little pickled onions really make it. The heuvos rancheros are delish too. All in all very tasty and filling",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=20,3.48,3.0,3.092,2.7079999999999997,3.1920000000000006

As far as the restaurant goes, I would recommend to stray from ordering any kind of steaks. My boyfriend ordered a steak once and it was dry, I have to a long time ago, and it was also dry and overlooked. But they're not a Steakhouse. So didn't expect much... I've had the miso salmon which I think is good. I also like the shrimp scampi but if you're not a garlic person, I'd avoid it.  The chicken costoletta,The flatbread pizza, are good... I've had other dishes but can't remember the names, so I'll leave it at that.  Overall, I think food is alright. Nothing too good but not too bad. The best part about the Cheesecake Factory is indeed the Cheesecake. Try the banana cream one, it's the best one!!!  The staff are very attentive, there is little to no wait. You are seated quickly.

Few things really differentiate one branch from another. This was my second time at this location. My boyfriend and I go to the nearest Cheesecake Factory every year for our anniversary (this is our 6th time total).  Service was not unforgettable, I have a pretty good threshold for it as I feel like I am not always in need of something. Our wait on a Friday night was only 15 minutes or so and the food was cooked awesomely. Farfalle bow tie pasta and the lemon piccata with angel hair is a must. Both delicious and creamy pastas that I can't forget. We also got the banana cheesecake (our second time having it, it's a fresh fave) and also the lemon raspberry which was even better than I expected.

My friend and I tasted our respective pastas and found that they were EXTREMELY BLAND. We had to try and add salt and pepper to salvage the taste. We were incredibly disappointed because Cheesecake Factory is a well-known ""higher class"" chain. We found that we could have made the pasta better tasting and for a far cheaper price. The whole meal tasted bland of cheap quality and I feel completely ripped off. The pasta is way too oiled and the chicken tastes as though it's from McDonald's or a restaurant a bit of higher quality.  THE WAIT: it took about 35 minutes for us to receive our food upon our request of asking for it. I had previously asked for bread and butter but the workers didn't include the butter nor any napkins.  The problem isn't as much the price as the quality. I go to republique in Downtown LA where the pastas are $40 each and my boyfriend and I each order one for ourselves but the quality makes up for the high price.  Overall, we don't plan on returning for over-priced, bland food that isn't worth the price.  Here is a photo of my food halfway after I ate it.

So at this point i am LIVID because I can't eat the food and now i have to drive to Cheesecake Factory and look for parking and pay for parking. I explained to the manager what happened - she apologizes and offers to remake it. I tell her i prefer a refund. She then asks me ""but the cheesecake was okay right?"" And refunds me just for the pasta. I should have been refunded for my ENTIRE meal being that they hugely inconvenienced me and I had to pay a delivery fee through postmates AND TIP the delivery person.

I must've talked to two different workers there but they would just brush me off and tell me that they would find someone. Several of the tables that were seated after us were served first and it was incredibly frustrating.

Another 10 minutes passed by and my friend was slowly getting ticked off so she flagged a random server down. I'm not the type of person to do that because it was understandable since it was busy. Our server came by and asked what we would like to drink. Once our drinks were placed, she asked if we wanted Bread and Butter and we politely said yes and told her that we were also ready to order. My friend got a Mushroom Burger and I got the Parmesan Herb Crusted Chicken. 15 minutes passed by and my friend started getting grumpy. She flagged down a random server to check up on our food because our server was no where to be found. 10 minutes later, the person we flagged brought our food out. Boy, were we hungry.
