99,Ian W.,"Pelham, NH",715,3717,5928.0,4.0,2012-01-16,"The Cheesecake Factory (TCF) is a pretty solid dining option offering a very extensive menu which reads like a storybook with several pages. It can take a while to decide on what to eat since there are so many choices. They also offer small (skinny) plates for those with smaller appetites and watching calories. Lunch specials are offered until 5PM, brunch is offered on Sundays and they also have specials in the bar area (Mondays-Fridays 4PM-6PM) offering selected full size appetizers for only $5.00. I've been to several TCF locations throughout the US and have had very good meals each time, but there was usually quite a wait to be seated. I found some TCF gift cards (a few years old)  which I needed to use up. My friend and I decided to make a special trip from NH to The Cheesecake Factory at the Northshore Mall for an early dinner and arrived here around 3:55PM on a Monday. We were seated immediately at a table in the bar area. Our server Todd arrived promptly and went over the specials and also informed us about the ""bar menu"" with several $5 appetizers listed. For appetizers ($5 each/normally $9.95 each), we ordered the Fried Calamari and the Fire Roasted Fresh Artichoke. The Fried Calamari (rings & tentacles) were coated in a light and crisp tempura batter (not too greasy) and served with a creamy garlic dip and tangy cocktail sauce. The Artichokes (3) were messy to eat, but were very good and fresh and the artichoke hearts were very tender, served with a creamy garlic dip and vinaigrette dressing. For dinner, the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta ($16.95-full sized portion) was very spicy which had tender shrimp, soft boneless chicken sauteed with tomato, onions, and peppers over soft linguini (regular and green noodles) and topped with fresh grated parmesan cheese (optional). My friend ordered the Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls ($5/normally $9.95) three rice paper rolled with bean sprouts, carrots, asparagus, shittake mushrooms, green onion, cilantro, & shrimp, served chiiled over crispy rice noodle & red cabbage and spicy peanut dipping sauce. The food was enjoyable and filling and we needed a box for the leftovers. Unfortunately, we did not save room for cheesecake and coffee, but probably next time. The service was very good, very attentive and informative. The food arrived in timely fashion, the ice waters were refilled and our server made recommendations from the menu.  We will be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-peabody?start=80,3.48,3.48,3.48,3.152,3.4800000000000004
200,Jackie B.,"South Hamilton, MA",24,17,,1.0,2012-02-06,"I will NEVER frequent this restaurant again.  They ruined my son's 18th birthday.  I know they don't reserve tables; however, I made a special trip to see if I could persuade them to help me out since my son needed a place to go with 20 friends.  The manager was a very nice guy (I think his name was Mike) and said ABSOLUTELY NOT A PROBLEM.  Well...when my son and his friends arrived 10 minutes early as they requested, they said it would only be a 20 minute wait.  What was supposed to be a 20 minute wait was 2 hours without any seating.  They were finally turned away after waiting over 2 hours.  The manager was rude and nasty even though these boys and girls behaved in a very adult and appropriate manner showing much patience.  I guess there were three business men eating and sitting in the middle of the 4 tables reserved for the kids.  Instead of offering to buy them a drink at the bar, they let them sit for 2 hours after their dinner was over.  This is very poor management.  The nicest restaurants will ask if they can get them another seat because the space is needed.  I speculate that because there were 20 kids, the wait staff just figured there would not be a big enough tip and decided to wear them down until they left.  So...bottom line...my son spent his birthday in the food court.  Just remember...what goes around comes around!  Again, I will NEVER go back there!  Just like every other mediocre chain restaurant, they will keep this up and eventually bite the dust!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-peabody?start=200,3.48,3.48,3.48,2.8200000000000003,3.4800000000000004
124,Jon B.,"Beverly, MA",6,24,4.0,2.0,2012-02-15,The food is great ... it's just getting there that's the problem. We were told the wait was 20 minutes when we arrived. After 30 minutes we started noticing people getting called ahead of us. I finally asked the hostess if we were forgotten and she assured me we were next. We then watched 3 other couples get called up and seated with me standing right there. 45 minutes later we finally get seated because I had to ask again. I would rather a restaurant is honest with me and tells me up front I'm going to be waiting an hour rather than lowballing so I might stay. This happened in my previous visit as well although I wasn't waiting as long. Moral of the story? Go here for great food but prepare to wait a lot longer than you are told. Also be sure to check in regularly to see if they forgot to seat you.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-peabody?start=140,3.48,3.48,3.48,2.9840000000000004,3.4800000000000004

However, the menu is ridiculously comprehensive, and there is absolutely something for everybody.  Most of the food is outstanding for a chain restaurant of this magnitude. The food prices are ok, if not a little high, but the drink prices are wayyyyy too expensive. Do your wallet a favor and don't drink here.  Our favorite food: the burger sliders, all the salads, and the spicy chicken chipotle pasta Our favorite drink: the white sangria We liked the Cambridge and Boston locations much more than this one, so if you live close to those, go there instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-peabody?start=120,3.48,3.48,3.48,3.216,3.4800000000000004
120,Jay O.,"Peabody, MA",3,23,15.0,5.0,2012-04-28,"Getting into the restaurant can be tough. The mall is very busy and you might have to park a little bit far away. We went on a Saturday afternoon and finding parking was a bit annoying. We (a party of three) had to wait less than 5 minutes to get a table despite the restaurant being packed. I was impressed with the short wait. The greeter guy was a friendly introduction to the restaurant. The decor in the restaurant was nice. It was fancy in my eyes. We found ourselves commenting on the decor every so often.  The waiter was great. We knew he was extremely busy; the restaurant was full. He brought us our drinks right away and was courteous. My sister got crispy chicken sliders. She asked for some extra sauces on the side which she got. I tried one of the sliders and it was great. Crispy, tender, and flavorful chicken. No complaints there.  I had a a barbecue chicken salad. It was phenomenal. The lettuce was crisp; none of it was wilted. It had flavorful, tender grilled chicken and crispy fried onion strings. It was an expensive dish at $15. I should have gotten the lunch sized portion because this salad was huge.  My girlfriend got a lunch sized salad similar to mine. She enjoyed it, also commenting that the veggies tasted fresh. We both ended up with leftovers.  We had a Hersey chocolate cheesecake with chocolate chips. It was rich, sweet, and flavorful.  They basically forced me to give them a 5/5. The staff was friendly attentive. They did all the little things like extra water refills, politeness, and attentiveness. The service was quick even though the place was so busy which I thought was remarkable. The food was exceptional. Maybe it was our lucky day, but this lunch was perfect. Only gripe would be the high prices, but with good staff, food, and ambiance, it is worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-peabody?start=140,3.6,3.6,3.6,3.2840000000000003,3.6000000000000005

143,Megan M.,"Woburn, MA",92,181,62.0,3.0,2012-06-29,"I try my best to avoid national chains altogether. To me, The Cheesecake Factory is just a fancier, expensive sit down McDonald's that serves alcohol with a minimum 30 minute wait; sometimes 1 hour.  Recently, the chain was sued because they purposely don't list prices for their adult beverages. It's appalling to know that after two drinks, the price you pay is more expensive than your meal.  I don't understand the fascination about this place. Yes, the food is decent in massive portions. But, I've had better for cheaper. And, does this nation truly need massive portions and quantities? Isn't there an epidemic going on? I'm certainly confused. Based on my recent visit, I met with friends who live in the area. To avoid a large tab, I ordered the cheapest listed drink: warm caramel macchiato and an ice water. $5!   (I think that's even cheaper than a slice of cheesecake.) My service was prompt and pleasant. Well trained, I'll give him that. In all honesty, there isn't much that impresses me about this place. It's over priced, waits are usually long, it's always frigid. Not my cup of tea.

176,Joy O.,"Essex County, MA",0,47,,3.0,2012-07-02,"We have been to this restaurant several times for lunch, dinner & brunch. They even have call ahead service called ""Curbside To-Go"" & catering. The menu is loaded w/over 200 selections.  Our servers Christine, Amanda(s), & Sara are always very thoughtful & accommodating--kids want chocolate chips or raspberry sauce for their pancakes-No Problem. One time the general manager even came out to personally accommodate us because Cheesecake knows how much we love to experiment. We love the Eggs Benedict for brunch, as well as all the different pancakes, the Energy Breakfast is a healthy choice w/a side of grilled chicken.  We highly recommend the small plates & appetizers:  Vietnamese Tacos were 3 delicious steamed moist Asian buns with tender roasted pork, crunchy marinated cucumbers & carrot strips, and onion with chiles, cilantro and sesame seeds.  Shrimp & grits were sweet n creamy corn-white cheddar grits (or any cheese you'd like--YUM!!). It's comfort food, but sadly only a very small portion. We opted for no shrimp, but enjoyed the delicious, tangy spicy tasso sauce on the side.  We love the Thai Lettuce Wraps where there's plenty to share & you can choose how you want to fill the lettuce leave wraps with: Satay Chicken Strips, Carrots, Bean Sprouts, yummy Coconut Curry Noodles with three delicious Spicy Thai Sauces: ** Peanut, Sweet Red Chili, and **Tamarind-Cashew.  Also recommended are the Pasta Carbonara & the Four Cheese Pasta. These standard, but comforting pastas are hearty creamy, cheesy pasta dishes. We liked how a scoop of creamy ricotta was set atop w/fresh basil in the latter, & the peas & bacon were the right touch for the carbonara. Even the lunch sizes are big enough to share. If you have room for dessert, try the one of the 50 deliciously creative cheesecakes such as Chocolate Coconut Cream Cheesecake: Coconut Cheesecake Topped with Coconut Cream Custard, all on a Chocolate Macaroon Crust. And the kids loved sharing the Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake: Chunks of Reese's® Peanut Butter Cups in their Original Cheesecake with Layers of Delicious Fudge Cake and Caramel--pure decadence!!

Usually decent, so we keep coming back. I love that the menu is so big -- and I should note that while I say that, I typically order the same thing time and time again, so I don't even know why a big menu is important. I guess it's like living near the beach: you don't always go, but it's nice to know that it's there. It's my menu security blanket, if you will. Almost everything I've ordered is has been really, really good. Which is impressive coming from (1) a chain (2) a 40-page menu (I mean, how can you get EVERYTHING right?) (3) a more than reasonable price tag. Included in my yummy favs: chicken sliders, factory chopped salad, margherita pizza flatbread, lettuce wraps.

He did but left the dirty rag on the table next to us.  He then took our order for drinks and appetizers and we asked for bread.  10 min later our drinks and appetizers arrived and we asked for bread again.  When he came to take our plates away later my teenage daughter said, ""we would still really like some bread"".

During our wait, we had reviewed the menu so knew immediately what we wanted to order.  We started with the Skinny Artichoke appetizer which included two artichoke halves, grilled and served with a mayo/aoli dip (delicious).  I have never had artichokes before served this way and must say it was great!.  I ordered the Skinny Mexican Tortilla Salad and my husband, the Skinny Chinese Chicken Salad.  Our waitress offered and brought bread, which I love!  The restaurant was quite busy so it took a little longer (than other experiences we have had at Cheesecake's) for our meals to arrive but not unreasonable based on the volume.   Our meals were excellent and hit the spot.  The only disappointing fact about this chain are the many entrees that are loaded with calories ...and watching the many diners who probably should be ordering from the ""skinny"" menu chow down on poor choices.   Hate to pass judgment but I wish the menu posted the calorie counts on the face on the menu for those who don't have a clue about making better choices.  The Skinny Menu is a great idea and surprisingly offers many delicious options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-peabody?start=140,3.44,3.44,3.44,3.44,3.4400000000000004

Cheesecakes are lovely too, but even then I can only handle half or less. Thankfully you can box up whatever you can't stuff into your face.

I have been to a few different locations, and the one in Peabody did not stand out to me in any specific way from the rest, which I consider to be a good thing, since it is part of a chain. The design of the restaurant is intricate and warm, and the bathrooms are always glistening with cleanliness, which I highly value in an establishment. The service I received when I went there yesterday was lunch was great; our waitress was extremely friendly, professional, and polite, while also being laid-back enough to feel comfortable around as the youthful diners that my boyfriend and myself are.  I enjoyed going there during the day, not only for the lunch prices (lunch menu is available until 5:00!) but also because of the amount of natural light let into the restaurant. On other occasions, I have been there in the evening and the lamps and chandeliers give off a very dim yellow glow that can make it hard to see at times. It is a bit straining on the eyes, especially when reading the menu, but it is all a part of the unique atmosphere that the Factory creates. Last time, I ordered the Fettucini with Chicken and Sun-Dried Tomatoes and cannot say that I will get it again, although I had ordered it last year and my memory of it was better than what I tasted when I tried it a second time. It is not to say it was unacceptably un-tasty; I was simply not a fan of the sauce this time-I blame it on my ever-changing taste buds! The pasta was cooked well, though the dish itself has both times been a bit too ""dry"" for me; better than swimming in sauce, I suppose. Cheesecake Factory has an amazing menu; it is truly extensive in all areas: appetizers, sandwiches, pasta dishes, meat dishes, desserts, and drinks. (Blueberry mojitos are a favorite choice of mine). They also have a ""skinny menu"" for those of you who prefer or need to eat ""lighter"".

180,Patrick C.,"Lynn, MA",5,34,5.0,2.0,2014-11-09,"Dined at Cheesecake Factory with my wife last week for dinner.  Crowded as always but that's expected at the Northshore Mall. Decor is very nice with high ceilings and intimate lighting.  We waited about a half hour, there was probably 30 people waiting as well.  For two people, you will not sit in a booth.  Rather a very small table that you can't even have more than two plates on.  Food is a bit pricey here, cheesecake starts at $6.99/slice.  Service was pretty good.  Our waitress got everything we needed.  Food portions are good, we had leftovers.  I give two stars due to the small table, lack of seating or waiting guests, and you can't have much of a conversation with your significant other because the people next to you are literally 2 feet away.  If I had known it would be that crowded and noisy, I would have just sat in the bar.  Also, sadly this is becoming a teenager hangout.  One couple was getting pretty physical in the lobby.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-peabody?start=180,3.24,3.24,3.24,3.0160000000000005,3.2400000000000007
67,Em B.,"Boston, MA",136,197,935.0,4.0,2014-11-24,"The Cheesecake Factory has always been a top favorite for me. They have a large menu selection, and great drinks. I have been to this location probably over 10 times, but I'm going to review the most recent visit. The restaurant and mall was absolutely packed, as I believe it was the first Saturday where everyone and their mother wanted to prepare for Christmas shopping. The entire front was filled with about 50 people, and 15-20 strollers. I walked in and asked how long the wait would be for 2 and she said there was no wait which was awesome. Of course we sat in a crowded area with one bench and one uncomfortable chair but beggars can't be choosers. So our server came over to us almost immediately. We ordered waters while we waited to decide but didn't want to spend the extra cash. The waitress forgot to bring the bread, which I reminded her. No harm, no foul but the bread is so key!!! We got Fried Mac n Cheese for an appetizer which was pretty good. I'd give them a 3 out of 5. I love mac and cheese, mac and cheese bites, anything to do with mac and cheese. I believe the ricotta was what threw off the taste a little. And I would have preferred 6 smaller ones than 4 larger ones but that's just me being a pain. Not the best but I'm a sucker for mac and cheese so. For my meal I ordered the Chicken Avocado Club because I couldn't commit to all of the flavors all the other dishes offer, while my mom ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. It took about 10-15 minutes to get which was great because we were starving. My mom said her pasta was spicy but delicious, she really enjoyed it. My sandwich was very good but hard to eat because of how tall it was. Then I had the Chocolate Godiva Cheesecake with Glazed Strawberries for dessert, while my mom ordered the Raspberry Lemon Cake Cheesecake? I always get the same dessert because I don't want to commit to and $8 slice of something I may not like. The Raspberry Lemon Cake Cheesecake was really good. I like how the bottom half isa  cake and the top half is cheesecake. The whipped cream at TCF is too heavy for such rich cheesecakes. We ordered 1 appetizer to split, 2 meals, and 2 slices of cheesecake and it was still almost $70. I thought skipping on the alcohol would make it less expensive. Nope!  In a past visit, I have wanted one of their signature drinks that they took off the menu and they were able to make it for me. I really appreciate that. Also found out they serve omelettes/breakfast all day. May be worth a try sometime.  TCF has good food, great dessert, great drinks, nice ambiance/ decor, friendly busy servers, and is definitely a spot you go for a casual hangout, or get together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-peabody?start=60,3.32,3.32,3.32,3.184,3.3200000000000003

Then we were seated and our Waiter asked to take our order for drinks, that was brought to us. but waiting in between for waiter to come back to take our order seemed to be long waiting time, We noticed that the couple that sat next to us had received their second drink by now and had gotten their dinner. Finally the Waiter apologized for the wait said it would be coming out soon, and blamed in on being a Friday night and so busy. My boyfriend and I just looked at each other puzzled, because it was Saturday night. Finally our food came and My boyfriends dish of chicken teriyaki was dry and we was not pleased at all, My dish of orange chicken, wasnt all that great because some of the chicken tasted like it was raw inside and some were not. That used to be my favorite dish of all time, But this night just took that away,Feeling really disappointed about how long we had to wait and then finally getting our dinner which was not good at all.

Now, let's discuss the pricey bar drinks we ordered... Well you know what, you get what you pay for here. These are not watered down and iced up mixed drinks. Many bars will not serve a Long Island ice tea, or if they do its not made the right way. Order one here! Try not to drive home after 5 of them though. Midori Sour? Excellent!

It was accompanied by a disappointing portion of only 4 mini broccoli florets (tops only for non broccoli fans) and their signature mashed potatoes that someone had added an excessive amount of black pepper to prior to serving. WHOA! If I had the extra time I would have sent the plate back and requested no pepper be added. My server was tired, but quite personable.

Recently I went with a group of 9 to celebrate a friend's birthday during their Sunday brunch. The food took almost an hour to come out and when it did two of the orders were wrong. We started with one waitress that transferred our table to another waiter and never told us about the switch. When the staff noticed we were antsy for our meals, the manager came to our table saying ""they would do anything to make our experience enjoyable."" Said in the most non-believable tone ever. Though the waiter that was transferred to our table was very friendly and nice, he did not check in once to see how our meals were and if we needed anything, which we did.  One girl ordered a breakfast sandwich eggs over hard another girl ordered a breakfast sandwich eggs over easy with no mayo and no ham. Both sandwiches, which we were told were the reason our meals took so long because they got messed up and had to be fixed, came out wrong in the end anyway. Both had ham and mayo with the eggs cooked at the wrong temperature. The waiter asked one girl ""if she had touched hers yet"" and ""if they just wanted to switch"". Which wouldn't make a difference because one girl didn't want ham and mayo anyway. Side note, the birthday girl had to suffer through dry toast because our table was completely avoided after the incident.  The food was okay.

Anyways, last night I came here with 3 other people and our server was great. Listened to our orders, got everything right and was very helpful. Him and my amazing fried macaroni and cheese balls earned the two stars! I think his name was Mike if I remember right. Anyways, my sister and I ordered the smokehouse burgers and my wife and sister in law ordered the ribeye steaks for $27. Their plates were small and definitely far from worth the price but at least their steaks were cooked right so they were fine. My sister and I both ordered our burgers well done. We bite into them and they're still bleeding. My sister didn't want to be a pain so she just ate hers but I had to send mine back because the thought of eating bleeding meat made my stomach turn. The server was nice about it and sent it back. Took about 15 min to get a new one and by the time I got it back I was full from picking at my fries so I just got it wrapped to go. I live all the way in Southbridge and Boston traffic was ridiculous so we didn't get home until about 1 am. I was hungry so I decided to heat up my burger. I bite it...looked fine...took a second bite and there was all pink meat in the middle. I was very upset. Not only my toppings weren't packed in the box or even my bbq sauce but my meat was not cooked thoroughly AGAIN. We had a $130 bill plus tip and I can't even get my burger cooked right after the second time.  This is very frustrating since this happens EVERY time I go here. I never eat dinner with my family I get to sit there and watch them and then they feel bad for eating while I'm waiting and it definitely ruins the mood.

32,Alyssa G.,"Danvers, MA",117,39,3.0,2.0,2016-05-06,"I honestly can say that I don't go here as often because the restaurant just isn't what it used to be. 1- the food hasn't been as good lately. It hasn't been completely hot out of the kitchen or as flavorful lately. We ordered the Chicken Quesadilla and 2 pieces were almost empty and there was barely any chicken. When I got my pasta, it seemed like it had been sitting for a while, as the top was barely warm.  2- service has been severely lacking. Tonight, we started with one server who was great and on her game. Then she transferred the table to another server. That wasn't the issue, I understand she wanted to get out of there ( although she was still there when we left? ) The server that took over was nice, but obviously unable to handle the extra table. I'm sure her section was no where near our table, as we were sitting for a while in between visits. Our food was taking a while, which she noticed, but it was still a little too long. After we got our food, she didn't come back until my boyfriend was done. I hadn't even gotten to eat most of my food because I needed to drink something (because of a throat condition) and didn't have anything to drink. Then when she took my plate, instead of asking if we wanted coffee or dessert ( which I did) she just walked away and came back 10 minutes later with menus. At this point, I was sick of waiting and decided to forget about the cheesecake. I understand she has other tables and such, but it's not fun to sit there waiting while everyone else just walks by and looks at your table. Multiple servers saw our empty drink glasses at the edge of the table and no one offered to help. Yeah, it's not their table, but it's a good practice.  I really hope that Cheesecake Factory can turn it around.

Waitstaff-Great!  Now, not so much (saying this with thick disappointment in my voice while slowly shaking my head side to side). Cheesecake Factory, you were my go-to restaurant for everything and anything. Birthdays. Anniversaries. Graduations. Valentine's Day. Mothers's Day. Tuesday... Over the last year I started to notice a greasy sheen developing on, well, every surface. I tolerated it. The food was still exceptionally consistent.  Next point.  When my husband and I started going to Cheesecake years ago we had a waiter named Chris. We always asked for him. Chris was attentive, funny, real. He never forgot my extra sauces on the side. He was just the right amount of chat and personality. If Chris wasn't working, no problem, all the servers were great! Now when we go, we get ""Lauren"" (made up name). Lauren has all the conversational skills of a potato. Lauren has a deadpan voice with monotone inflections. Lauren is one of three or four waitstaff that end up bringing food and such to our table. They might as well all be ""Lauren"". Two more points of consternation: 1) The last two times I went to Cheesescake, while I was leafing through the (now slimy with residue) menu, I came across food smoothed between the pages.  Both times.  2) This last point should be the first point and highlighted at that!  The last two times I/we went to Cheesecake Factory the food was NOT CONSISTANT!!! The first time the Alfredo sauce in the Fettuccine was split and sour. My Shrimp Scampi was delicious, but my daughter was out a meal. My husbands burger was extra well done when he ordered it medium rare.  The last visit was the clincher.  Split sauce (my daughter always orders the Fettuccine Alfredo (picky eater)), Burger over cooked, skimpy sauce on the Mac and Cheese Balls aaaaand my Pasta Carbonara was dry. Dry, dry, dry. Top that off with food in my slimy menu and ""Lauren"" as our waitress and Cheesecake Factory made its debut on my ""Blacklist"".  Side note (I'm not a jerk. I waited tables for years!!!)

I go in knowing what to expect with what I am eating and haven't been disappointed. I was, however, very disappointed with the service. In a couple words: severely lacking. We were seated and waited for our server. And waited. And waited. After about 15 minutes, she finally comes over and gets our drink order and hands us menus. My husband asked for strawberry lemonade. I asked for water. Pretty simple, I think. The table(s) next to us had a group of about 10 people and all ordered cocktails....after we place our water and lemonade order. It's not that I care about what they are drinking. It's the fact that all their cocktails take time to prepare and mix (especially when there are several of them) as opposed to our very quick drink order, one of which is WATER. So how is it that they get their drinks several minutes before we do? I mean it's the same server.   We actually did get to order food before they did, which was surprising given how the server was bending over backwards for them and seemingly ignoring us. While waiting, baskets of bread kept being given to them. We had to ask for ours...more than once. Not surprisingly, their food came out first, getting it in about 10-15 minutes while we waited almost double that. How does a group of at least 10 people get all their food before a table of two when we ordered first? I'll tell you how: they kept reordering cocktail which is $$$$ for the restaurant. And when they are spending that money, I guess the server doesn't care much about the table right next to them that she is also serving.  Extremely disappointing. For a chain, I rather like Cheesecake Factory. But this location seriously needs to work on their service.

Wait time: 60 minutes, probably pretty standard for 7:15 on a Saturday, but the host was entirely too rude about it when I said I didn't hear the time. Luckily we ended up snagging a high top in the bar area. Atmosphere: the music was WAY too loud, especially considering the number of people in the restaurant. I couldn't hear my friend sitting right next to me. The server was pushy to get food in, until she ""got us"". Not sure what that means, but yeah we'd like a moment to talk, relax, and take a look at the menu. She ended up being alright though. Drinks: we ordered the Mumm napa split and only got one of the bottles. Food: avocado egg rolls were good, chicken piccata was a problem, the sauce was bland, the chicken was undercooked on one side, and I'm pretty sure they didn't salt the pasta water, veggie burger was very loose and fell apart.  The biggest issue by far though: there were two small children SITTING AT THE BAR! For almost an hour and not one single employee said a word!! The bartender took orders, served them food and drinks, etc! They couldn't have been more than 8 years old! This is a busy restaurant! Dozens of servers, bartenders, hosts, busers. How did no one know that's ILLEGAL? Finally, on the way out I asked for the manager and he said he hadn't noticed. This blew me away.

The dish was very bland, not a hint of lemon and the capers were sparce.  I actually felt sick halfway through my meal and didn't finish it.  My youngest ordered the steak which was served to her about 15 minutes after everyone else's dish which was really annoying because we had already waited 45 minutes to be seated and another 30-40 for our meals.  We went during a week night, so I'm not sure that the issue was.  I felt it was extremely expensive for what it was which is basically gourmet fast food.   We ordered desert to go since we had a cake waiting at home.  The Chocolate Tower cake was massive however once again, not impressive, the quantity was there but not the quality that you would expect with the high price.  My stomach ached the entire way home.    I won't be returning, I'd rather go to a non-chain restaurant and get the quality I'm paying for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-peabody?start=100,2.8,3.28,3.28,2.248,3.088

11,Alexa G.,"Boston, MA",219,36,12.0,2.0,2017-01-05,"The only reason this review is receiving even two stars is because of that magnificent chocolate cookie dough cheesecake.  When we walked in, it was going to be a 25-30 minute wait-- not bad and we were willing to wait. Luckily I was able to snag two bar stools while my boyfriend headed to the restroom and then out to his truck for something in the lot. I sat there for some time-- possibly 10 minutes and the same male bartender walked by a multitude of times. Now, I work in a restaurant and I'm the editor of a newspaper so I know all about busy. However, he didn't even acknowledge me, as we was serving the male on one side of me and the other male on the opposite side. When my boyfriend came over, I went to the host stand to  cancel our names for the table, which took a mere 60 seconds. As I was heading back, my boyfriend had a napkin and plate in front of him immediately. I got back and he was asked what he wanted to drink immediately. I was never asked, throughout the course of the meal, if I wanted a drink even though my boyfriend was asked multiple times if he wanted a refill. Not sure if the bartender just didn't like serving women or if there was something else wrong because all of the men at the bar were taken care of at great length while I was barely acknowledged.  THE FOOD was okay but pretty boring. My boyfriend had the bang bang chicken, which was good but not spectacular. I had the Large Sautéed Shrimp with Angel Hair. The sauce was boring and didn't have that kick of flavor or even a punch of garlic. Also, it didn't taste like they cooked with wine as advertised. It tasted like it was strictly diced tomatoes warmed up on pasta with a few large shrimp tossed on the outside of the plate. And I'm pretty sure they did not season the water when they cooked the pasta. It was just an all-around flat dish.  I do NOT recommend this location. It looks great on the outside with a large menu (possibly too large?) but you certainly only get your wallet's worth at the take-out cheesecake stand by the door.

I called 5 days before our visit to set up a reservation for 12 people and the hostess told me they do not take reservation and to come in 45 minutes before we wish to be seated. Most of us in the party know it would be at least an hour so come Sunday my sister went in to put her name on the list. She was told she would wait minimum 2 hours. She told the hostess that we called and were told to be there 45 before we wished to be seated. My sister told the hostess that we were misinformed and had planned around the information we were given before which is why we did not make a reservation. The hostess told my sister that they do not reservations because it does not benefit the restaurant and that we did not meet their requirements to their policy so we had to wait. The manager was then evolved and showed interest in accommodating us for about 10 minutes. At this point the restaurant was still not busy. He told my sister he would do everything he could to have us sat in an hour and apologized. An hour and a half later we ask the hostess if she had any idea how much longer and she told us they were just waiting for tables to clear so they can be cleaned. At this point everyone in my party was hungry and frustrated as people were coming in and being sat a lot faster then we were. One girl was pregnant and asked for a water which she never received. The manager was no where to be seen and no one came up to us to keep us updated on the status of the tables. After over two hours waiting, we decided we were going to leave. At this point the manager was at the cheesecake station ignoring us and doing work on the POS system. In the 2 hours we waited we were not offered a drink or any thing during our wait. All the staff ignored us and did not try to be friendly with us. We asked about our tables a few times and were answered rudely as if we were being annoying. After almost 2 hours and a half my sister went up to the manager and told him we had waited over two hours and that we were frustrated and we were leaving. Apparently he had forgotten about us because he spoke to my sister as if he had no idea who she was. She repeated back to him what he had told her earlier and said ok has it been that long? she replied with yes its been way longer its been over two hours. He said ok and walked away. Less than a minute later we were sat. At this point everyone in the party was already cranky and hungry. The waiter was nice and quick. However during our dinner not once did the manager come by to check on us or apologize for our inconvenience. The food came out quick but was not very good. At the end of the meal we at least expected the birthday boys dessert to be comp from a $317 tab. However we were not compensated for anything and we were shown no remorse for our inconvenience. On top of that, they brought dessert over and sang when the birthday boys were not even at the table! The 7 year old was so disappointed because that's all he had waited for all night was to blow out his candle. When my sister told them this one of the servers gave her attitude and told her they could sing again if it was a huge deal. She told him to forget it. The staff seemed to be very annoyed with us and seemed even more annoyed when we told them it was someone's birthday dinner.

43,Chau L.,"North Reading, MA",15,130,211.0,4.0,2017-05-17,This location is my favorite one. The waiting time isn't long. The customer service is always good. Quick service and always on top with refilling your drinks. I always got the Louisiana chicken pasta. The fried chicken is seasoned just right and always crunchy. The sauce is absolutely amazing. The portion is always huge! Their chicken Marsala is great too. The sauce isn't too heavy but perfect. Ohh and their fries are delicious too. Always crispy and fried perfectly. I always have to order a side plate of their fries whenever I am here. Only if their prices are a little on the lower side then I would come here every week just for their awesome Louisiana chicken pasta.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-peabody,2.64,3.01,3.01,,2.8619999999999997
47,Kim E.,"Boston, MA",1,12,1.0,1.0,2017-05-24,Wow thanks for giving everyone else who had a birthday cheesecake but you give my nephew whipped cream? The service is the worst- the waiters/waitresses and even the male bartender we're so busy on a Wednesday night they left my table waiting for bread. After waiting about 20 mins I asked where our starter bread was and the Manager apologized and finally brought it out. I ordered steak medium rare and my mother in law medium and when they brought both steaks out they didn't specify which was which. Go to a different cheesecake or a different restaurant.

Took us over 45 minutes to get our food, and we ordered a dish to go while we ordered our food. Every time we said excuse me to our waiter Jennifer C she just walked away, maybe if she spent less time chatting with her friends at another table... finally ordered cheesecakes and said it's for the birthday boy because we heard lots of people being sung to and we were brought our cake with no happy birthday. Finally our check came and she didn't put our to go meal in so we had to wait even longer for that meal she said it was ""so crazy"" but if you looked around the place was almost empty.... we heard more people being sung happy birthday to so I stood up and yelled YA HAPPY BIRTHDAY FROM THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY to my friend and Jennifer came over and said ""did someone take away her coke yet???"" So rude will probably never come back after this experience what a shame.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-peabody?start=40,2.6,2.97,2.97,,2.822
41,Alexandra C.,"Boston, MA",560,715,739.0,4.0,2017-06-02,"Is $45.95 for a 10-inch chain restaurant cheesecake outrageous? Of course. But when your grandmother specifically requests a cheesecake from The Cheesecake Factory, you get her what she wants. As I didn't eat here, I can't comment on the restaurant itself, but the woman at the cheesecake counter was very patient as she explained the different pricing and sizing options. The original cheesecake is the CHEAPEST so, naturally, that's the one I selected. You have the option to add sour cream topping to the cake at no extra charge. As soon as you get to the interesting flavors such as Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake, Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake, Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cheesecake, Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake etc. the prices get astronomically high. After I paid, I watched as Maria, the baker, began to spread topping on the cheesecake. She was a pro and so quick! The counter woman then showed me the cake to make sure it looked good, boxed and bagged it, and I was on my way. I was in and out in approximately ten minutes. Minus one star for ridiculously disproportionate pricing, but otherwise great service and a happy grandmother.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-peabody,2.64,2.97,2.97,,2.838

All of my party ordered burgers and they were tasty.

39,Melina P.,"Fremont, NH",0,1,,1.0,2017-07-05,"Where do I start? My family and I came here to eat a quick lunch/dinner after we found out PF Changs next door recently closed. Since we don't live nearby, we always grab a few slices of cheesecake before we leave, but we don't usually eat in. We decided what the heck, let's do it. So we went in and after admiring the eye opening cheesecake display we waited to be seated. After finding the hostess, she took our name and told us it would be a few minutes. We got seated in a booth that had food underneath it so the young women swept it up before we sat down. A few minutes later, our waiter came over and asked what we wanted to drink. We then looked at the menu and ordered. I tried to order the $19.95 Seared Ahi Tuna, but, of course, they were out of Tuna. I then ordered the grilled salmon. When the food finally arrived, it was quite bland and didn't have much flavor. I think I ate more of the bread we were given than my actually dish. After the disappointing food, we ordered cheesecake and hoped for something. I ordered the Oreo Extreme Cheesecake with hot fudge on the side. This came pretty quick and looked pretty good. After eating about half and saving the rest for home, I got the 85 dollar bill. With tip, this $100 dollar dinner was not worth any of it. If I could've given this experience 0 stars I would've if I didn't have the cheesecake. All in all, the Cheesecake Factory should stick to cheesecake and that's it. We will not be going back to eat in there anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-peabody?start=40,2.6,2.98,2.98,,2.8280000000000003

Once I got to the register and paid I was told it would be another 10 minutes. That was now 30 minutes after I placed the order. It's been 15 minutes since then and I still don't have my food. I ordered take out after working 12 hours and really just wanting to get home, eat and go to bed. If I knew it would take 1.5 hours for a simple take out order I would have gone someplace else else.

This is the 2nd time we've given this location a try and we were disappointed both times. Today was definitely the LAST time I'll be back to the location. The waitress was really nice so we tipped her well but the food was horrible. We got the nachos with chicken as an appetizer which is our fave app, they burnt it for the 2nd time. The chicken was literally so hard that we didn't even eat the chicken because we couldn't chew it. My husband loved his Cuban sand which but both ends of it were burnt. My daughter ate NONE of her meal the grilled chicken was burned and hard just like the nacho chicken, mashed potatoes looked like it had more skin then potatoes and the broccoli needed to be steamed longer. I got the lunch sized chicken Caesar salad and I didn't even at half of it. I was better off getting a salad from Nicks Bistro for $10, seriously. The first time we went just my husband and I spend $73 tipped well and the food was gross we complained about the service and food on the survey and thy sent us a $25 gift card to come back and give them another try. Seriously? So that's what we did this evening. We spend over $100 tonight my husband said he should've just put a $100 bill in the toilet and flushed it and saved his gas. If that helps you at all.

I'm torn between 2 and 3 stars because our waitress was friendly and very helpful but I can't give 1/2 star . I've heard people rave about this place and now that I've tried it I just don't get it . My fish was over cooked to the point that whatever they fry it in was soaked into the fish and every bite was dripping grease onto my fries , which by the way were very good but I can get good fries at McDonalds . The Margherita pizza my son ordered was a little plain , lacking flavor and toppings . The one good thing was my wife's Bacon Bacon Burger , she's not usually a beef eater but she devoured it mmmmming with every bite so I'm guessing it was really good . And who puts onions in cole slaw , as flavorless as it was the onions did nothing for it , a little salt and pepper would have been a huge improvement . And $8 for a piece of cheesecake , are you kidding me , $8 , what nerve . Total for lunch for 3 without drinks of desert , just over $60 .
