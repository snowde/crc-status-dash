But there's something about The Cheesecake Factory that's comforting...in a stuff-your-face-with-4,000 calories-kind-of-way. It's really hard to find a place to grab a late (post-10pm) dinner in the Miramar/Pembroke Pines area.  The first time I tried that... the restaurant we ended up at had run out of most of the food, and served us cold dishes.  So it was back to square one.  We ended up at Cheesecake because out of 3 restaurants we checked in the Pembroke Gardens shopping area... it had the shortest wait.  Sorry, but it's the truth. So glad it worked out that way.  Our big group could have a conversation (as opposed to the loud-as-a-nightclub RA sushi), and we didn't have to wait over an hour (like at The Pub).  We had a great server... who kept really good tabs on all of our drink orders (and 2nd rounds).   We gorged on the fried mac-and-cheese balls (!!!!), avocado eggrolls and all sorts of main dishes. I will end it by saying that no matter what time of day it is, or what diet I'm on... I will always order a Peach Bellini with my meal at Cheesecake.   Trust me on this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pembroke-pines?start=160,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003

Being  a new restaurant, in the area the wait was rather long but expected. No complaints about the waiter but the food left much to be desired and very disappointing. i ordered a chicken dish and the second piece was completely burned on the bottom which I did not taste until I had eaten the first piece. By then I felt it was too late to return the food. The next time I will inspect my food closely prior to eating it. Don't think I will be going back anytime soon. The wait was not worth the food which was sub-standard...unlike the other Cheesecake factory rest.

201,Meghan M.,"Orlando, FL",209,276,69.0,4.0,2012-02-14,I am a huge fan of The Cheesecake Factory and I have been to locations all over the country.  This location was smaller than other ones I have been to which did lead to a much louder than normal experience but the food was as always... very good.   If you are looking for a restaurant in which everyone can find something to eat then this is your place (over 10 page menu!)-I recommend the buffalo blasts as an appetizer.  I recommend going for lunch for the lunch portion meals or if you go for dinner split a meal because I promise you that you will not be able to finish your meal. And of course... you can never forget to finish the meal off with cheesecake- I am a fan of the classic cheesecake but I have had several others and they were all good just some too sweet for my taste.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pembroke-pines?start=200,3.408,3.408,3.408,3.408,3.408

Regardless of the size, the experience and the for is what matters. The menu is aways filled with variety. If you're a picky eater, no problem. They have tons of great dishes to choose from.  One of my favorite appetizers to share with a group is the deep fried macaroni and cheese. The servings are always large so it's good to keep in mind that you might want to plan to share with other's before ordering.  Another great thing to look forward to is the bread they bring to the table. They usually bring two different types of bread with butter to hold you over until the food arrives. It's so good, you may even want to ask if you can bring some of it home with you after the meal is over.  As far as the cheese cake goes, I've always been way too stuffed to try any of their dessert. So I can't have any opinion on the specialty cheesecake they have.

225,Melli B.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",125,285,457.0,3.0,2012-03-24,"A chain with fresh food. I have yet to go to The Cheesecake Factory and have what I would consider a bad meal. This particular Cheesecake Factory has opened near my home at The Shops at Pembroke Gardens. They introduced their new SkinnyLicious menu which includes alcoholic beverages under 150 calories, and salads and entrees which I believe do not exceed 800 calories which is commendable since they are known for serving SALADS THAT ARE 1500 calories!! I am no stranger to The Cheesecake Factory because it's a nice ""girls day out"" Happy Hour spot. They have a really nice happy hour menu but it ends super early (6 pm) so you gotta rush to get there after work and then hope there is parking available. I recommend you try the avocado egg rolls, the mushroom lettuce wraps, and the Thai salmon.  The skinny menu is nice and has many options also. I'm sure no one is a stranger to the Cheesecake Factory as its a chain restaurant but if you're into Happy Hour with the girls or just hanging out for lunch with your significant other, they have outdoor seating and it's shaded.

When I go out to eat its about the whole experience, not just the food. No matter how good the meal, if the service sucks, its not worth my time.

Too bad, I had to go all the way to Florida to make this visit happen. I hate the pages and pages of menu items. As a first-timer, it took way too long for me to browse and decide. I mean, really? If your menu is not between 2-4 pages then we have a problem. Then again, I guess it is a ""factory"" right, but not just for cheesecake.  The bread was yummy. I ordered the island grilled chicken which was delicious. When it comes to grilled meat, you usually run the risk of winding up getting served a piece of meat that is dry. Luckily, the kitchen staff know what they're doing, because my chicken was still moist and flavorful. As a Caribbean, I wasn't too happy with the small spoon of brown rice on my plate. However, they do tell you what to expect in the description. We were stuffed. Since we arrived just an hour before closing time, there was no room or time for dessert. The prices were reasonable too. The decor in the restaurant and the bathroom were divine. It's a great place to dine and host events. Very elegant and classy.

Very thin chicken cutlets are covered with a sauce containing lemons, capers, and mushrooms.  We deduced that the sauce must also contain heavy cream, a little wine possibly, and some butter, among other things.  It's accompanied by a small mound of vermicelli.  What a dish!  It is just sooo good.  I'd be happy with this as a birthday meal, ""a last meal"", or in lieu of a steak dinner.  Simple, tasty, and very filling.

The only reason I broke my personal boycott of all Cheesecake Factory owned restaurants is because someone gave my dad a $100 gift card and my family decided Father's Day is a good time to get rid of it. We anticipated having to wait at least an hour because that's just how it is at Cheesecake Factories everywhere. You wait obscenely long periods of time for mediocre food. This location is no exception. My family and I waited for 45 minutes. Their pager doesn't reach outside of the front door area so you're pretty much forced to stay close by. Once they paged us, we were herded like cattle into the front of the restaurant to another waiting space in the path of the waiters. Smart. This is something I've never understood about Cheesecake Factory. They know that at EVERY location they've ever established, that there's a long wait. Why not have a waiting room or a more advanced paging system so that people aren't jam packed into a small area? One of the hostess' was far from friendly too. She clearly did not want to be at work this evening and her eye rolls every time she passed customers made it clear that she didn't care who knew it. Once we got to our table and placed our orders, the food was brought out in a timely manner. The calamari was not very good however. It was pretty much just batter. My mom ordered the skinny salmon dish and she said the salmon was dry. My dad thought his salmon from the regular menu was average. I ordered the skinny lemon shrimp and the shrimp was pretty flavorless. The dish was nothing to remember. All in all, our experience left a lot to be desired.

Literally all of the spots were taken, so after driving around hunting for a spot I dropped of my gf at the front door. Finally found a spot and the place was slammed. We found seats at the bar and we were debating wether or not to wait for a table and I'm so glad we decided to stay at the bar. We met Marissa she's the bartender of the night and let me tell ya she was on fire. She attended everyone and every drink order that was being placed. She handled every request swiftly with accuracy.  She immediately got our drinks, that amazing bread and put the baseball game that we requested. She was a little energizer bunny, TFC you have a very valuable asset and it was a delight watching her perform. Extremely friendly, we got to know that she's an eagles fan, recommended the specials for the night and made sure our drinks were topped of. Again all while this place is slammed with people everywhere.  Moving on to the app we went with the avocado rolls, much better than the ones from bj's. Not spicy and they deliver the taste. For the entree I went with the Caesar salad and my gf went with the steak tacos. We asked for extra cheese on the side, a few lemons and balsamic vinaigrette and the girls in the back were also on their game. I will be coming back and recommend this place very highly for their service/quality keep up the good work, and make sure to take care of Marissa even though she's not a dolphins fan ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pembroke-pines?start=80,3.8,3.51,3.51,2.9000000000000004,3.626

I totally understand  if the kitchen is backed up during the busy hour, but when the restaurant is less than half full it shouldn't take half an hour to bring out two lunch entrees. The staff are relatively friendly for the most part, so thumbs up for that. There happy hour specials are awesome! My recommendation is the happy hour burger because you will get the most bang for your buck. It's basically your standard double cheeseburger on a brioche bun. For $5.50 Avocado eggrolls have a nice tangy taste to them and comes with a sweet Asian-pesto like sauce. Definitely worth trying. Cheesecakes are a little overpriced in my opinion. One slice goes about $7. That's more expensive than getting a meal off the happy hour menu. In my opinion, desserts should definitely be cheaper than the actual entree itself for a even sweeter ending to your meal. My favorite is the tiramisu and white chocolate macadamia cheesecake.

It was a Friday night so, as expected, it was loud and crowded. Our wait was only 20 minutes which wasn't too bad. The menu has a lot of items. I must say that the service was quite slow. Our server was very friendly but everything, including our water, took a very long time to reach us and we only got one type of bread because apparently they hadn't baked any more. Of course every item we asked about, we were told was terrific.  Everyone in my group was less than excited about our dishes. The taste was plain and not well seasoned and for what we ordered was very overpriced in my opinion. I've had better in local diners. The only saving grace for this place is because all the desserts we ordered were fantastic. I ordered a Strawberry Shortcake which was huge and very good. I guess they should have just stuck to desserts.

The Pembroke Pines Cheesecake factory does this EXACTLY. PROs: Red Velvet cheesecake was AMAZING per usual.  -They were even kind enough to split a slice so I could share it with my coworker. I don't know if this is a company wide practice as some sites will do it without a problem but others end up being a bit confused when I request it. Cons: Other foods were disappointing. -I was dining here with some coworkers. I got a sandwich and fries while they ordered more complicated dishes. One coworker got the fried mac and cheese as an entree. They did arrive with the other entrees but they were cold. While I have no proof, I assume that they were prepared to be sent as an app, read the ticket and kept the dish back and sent it out with the other entrees. My other coworker got a salmon dish that was unmemorable other than the fact that the taste of the salmon was completely masked by a mess of ""herbs"" and butter. (I tried A bite and didn't ask for more. She did not finish it either.)   As a prologue, I REALLY HOPE THAT THIS HAS BEEN FIXED BY THE TIME THIS IS POSTED: -I went to the restroom. In the ladies' room, there were 2 stalls. I opened the door to the handicapped stall and saw it was occupied by an older woman with a walker. I tried to apologize and she said it was ok as the lock was broken.

Yesterday we had a farewell party for our co-worker. We had a big party, about 25 people, and I am impressed how well organized the whole process was. Especially, that they split checks for each and every individual that was seated. That's a huge plus for big parties. They sat us near the bar area so that was convenient. They have great happy hour specials and an array of cheap apps and salads that are included in the happy hour menu. Happy hour is from 4-6pm.  I ordered the Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls for $5.50. It was an amazing deal and I got very full from just that alone. The roll is filled with vegetables, shrimp, and rice noodles. Its wrapped in rice paper and it comes with a peanut and spicy chili dipping sauce. The spicy chili was my favorite! I also ordered the fried avocado rolls. I cannot even begin to describe the amount of joy I had eating this amazing appetizer. You know the section of yelp that asks what the last food you were to eat if it was your last day on earth? I have to add this app in there. It was THAT GOOD!  I could not for the life of me leave the Cheesecake Factory without having a cheesecake. So I had one slice of the Chris Outrageous Cheesecake. Anyone that knows me knows that I ALWAYS leave room for dessert. This cheesecake has to be the best cheesecake I HAVE EVER HAD!!! This cheesecake consists of a Layer of moist chocolate cake, a layer of Brownie, Toasted Coconut-Pecan Frosting and Creamy Chocolate Chip Coconut Cheesecake. Who created this??? Was it Chris? I want to meet this guy and hug him! And also curse him for creating such a heavenly sensation filled with a week full of calories, fat, carbs, and sugar. Oh well, It was worth every bite. I enjoyed immensely. Total euphoria.  Trust me...order this cheesecake and you experience a slice of heaven!  PS. The cheesecake factory has $6 valet which is worth it so you don't have to park 2 miles away. Or maybe after eating here it'll be worth parking far to burn some calories.

Most corporate restaurants like the cheesecake factory usually have extremely high standards regarding customer service, it is unfortunate that this cheesecake factory seems to be lacking in that area. One other problem we have experienced at this particular location which is disgusting, is that the people who were serving the cheesecakes were not wearing gloves and were pretty much sticking their fingers into our desserts.

I like this location because it is perfect after a day of shopping. They have indoor and outdoor seating, and even on the busiest day I have never had to wait long to be served. The restaurant is spacious and clean, and the staff is friendly and professional. As with every other Cheesecake Factory, the bread is to die for! They have a very extensive menu where you can get whatever you are craving - pasta, steak, seafood, burgers, sandwiches, sushi, Chinese food, Thai food, Mexican food - they literally have everything! I recommend the Tex Mex egg rolls if you are in the mood for a Mexican appetizer. The orange chicken is delicious and so is the Bang Bang chicken and shrimp - my favorite dish. I highly recommend if you like curried food.  Their drink menu is awesome because they have a lot of strong and fruity cocktails which I am a huge fan of. You can't go wrong with the Mai Tai!  They also have a skinny menu for meals and drinks if you are watching your weight, and they let you know of their product is gluten free or began friendly.  The cheesecake here is delicious and the serving size is enough to share.

When I was younger I went to the Cheesecake Factory in Aventura Mall for the first time, and being only a kid,  and  were all I cared for. But oh  boy what a horrible experience I had with what I ordered . I don't remember what I ate (not sure if it's repressed memory by now or I was just to horrified) but nonetheless, I remember telling my mom no hell No I'm not eating whatever crap was in front of me. Sent it back, remember the second meal being a burger and fries. Nope, didn't happen. Didn't like it, didn't think it was normal; so we sent it back. I ended up telling my mom at a young age to never take me back to Cheesecake Factory EVER!!l (too cute, little old me) Being a real foodie means you LOVE  FOOD, you ENJOY  FOOD at any given moment, you SAVOR  flavors and you take your time to taste, inspect, and move on with the next bite before the waiter ask you is everything ok?! Yea, it's serious business being a foodie. FAST FORWARD to 2027, In February I gave the Cheesecake Factory another shot for my grandmothers birthday, unfortunately I didn't have a choice in the matter especially when have relatives from out of the country are in town. this time around changing my location and going to the newly renovated mall center near Pembroke Pines mall.  My family and I walked in and of course we expected a time as anyone who goes out to eat in a Sunday. The wait was long nearly 1 hour, the place was so crowded, I've seen The Aventura location crowded before but this....this was a whole new level of groups and individuals just sitting and walking out waiting for their little machine to vibrate. Finally we were seated, the place is grande, spacious, elegant with high ceilings and the atmosphere was so different than i remember the Aventura location. Changing scenery did the job. This time. I ate like a champ, the experience was one worth enough for me to create a review on YELP (kind of reminds me of the South Park episode, when the whole town business was controlled by YELP reviewers I had the fried calamari and the Cajun pasta and we order pizza and salads and drinks, best part yet, this location has a mirror where a wall should have been separating the kitchen from the restaurants.

Our water was quick to get refilled & all the food came out hot. The bill came out in one check but our waiter didn't mind splitting it up & did so with a great attitude.

47,Rebeca M.,"Hialeah, FL",0,10,3.0,2.0,2017-08-01,We got there at about 9pm so it was pretty dark as you can imagine. We chose to sit outside because that was the shortest wait but I really regret it now. The lights they had outside were tiny so they didn't do much to illuminate  but that wouldn't have been so bad if they actually worked. I looked all around and half of the lights weren't working at all. We had to use our phones to look at the menu. We told our waiter and he said he couldn't do anything about it. Okay but can you move us to a table with working lights? Or inside? I didn't make a fuss about it because I was with my family but I can't believe management at this location would be so careless. Oh and it was raining hard. They did lower these curtains to keep the rain out but our feet still got wet even when it was all the way down. I also felt like the staff took longer to serve us maybe because they forgot about us?

Years ago I visited this location for the first time for a birthday event.  I ordered a dish that I typically order at the Aventura location.  When the food came, it was disgusting.  I swore off this location.  Recently, however, I was in the area and had a craving for Evenlyn's Favorite Pasta (which I have had before at Aventura and loved it).  I decided to get it at the PP location out of sheer convenience and because I figured that enough years had passed that perhaps the quality of the food had improved.  I was wrong.  By comparison to the Aventura location, it was again terrible.  I will never buy food at this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pembroke-pines?start=40,3.08,3.21,3.21,,3.158

The service may be the worst in this capital of rude, non English speaking help ().  They eventually bring several menus full of the most unhealthy garbage I've eaten in years. I was at a Cheesecake Factory a few years ago because it was next to an Apple Store and it was very much like this experience. I stupidly thought that some of the Apple might rub off, but no and this is exactly the same unpleasant experiment. What really gets me is that they are too cheap to install WiFi. Oh well, it gives me an opportunity to jot down a few thoughts; I'm sad to say they are all bad. When I asked for lemon I got NO LEMON for the oh so so sweet dumplings. Yuck!

Tonight at this location I ordered the lemon-herb roasted chicken which I have ordered dozens of times before. They gave me chicken breasts covered in a sauce. This is not what the dish should be at all. It should be half a chicken roasted. I called the waiter over and his response was ""I have no clue what that is"". That is not exactly something you want to hear from your waiter at all. The manager came over and apologized and offered to make me something else. So I ordered the chicken piccata which my sister also had. It was pasta and chicken drench in this oily mystery sauce instead of its normal lemon sauce. They also did not offer to take my plate off the bill after the entire issue. After returning home, my sister ended up getting sick because of the food.

18,Tracy W.,"Hollywood, FL",11,40,30.0,4.0,2017-12-20,"Julios, was an excellent server. He recommended new items and was very attentive.  I hope I spelled his name right.  Anyway it took us about 30 minutes to get a seat but once we sat down the servicing to pretty quick for men. My son had the BBQ Burger and I had the four cheese pasta with chicken. The meal was pretty standard despite the prices. You can always expect if you're going to The Cheesecake Factory that the prices are going to be pretty steep the portions are pretty huge so you get what you pay for however if you want to save on cost split your meal. There's enough for two people when you order so this should be simple we had the crab bite appetizer now let me tell you this was the first time that I had this appetizer and it was delicious I will definitely order this again. I think in the future if I go to Cheesecake Factory I will just stick with appetizers I would not get a whole meal I never eat the whole thing and I usually always end up caring take out containers. If you never been the cheesecake before please expect to bring your wallet and at least spend $70 for two people if you're ordering appetizers and a drink you can cut the cost and make it about 60 if you take the drinks out LOL. Cheesecake is a great go-to restaurant however Pembroke Square Gardens where it's located is overcrowded and hard to find parking but I guess it's all apart of the package.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pembroke-pines,3.0,3.24,3.24,,3.1440000000000006

My friend didn't like the soup she said it was to salty when it arrived. My teen liked her pasta with the sausage and shrimp. My daughter and friend ordered a lemonade my daughter had the strawberry and my friend had a cucumber lemonade. They bother said it was extra sweet and had to get a cup of water to dilute it.  I like the service but didn't like the food. My pasta on the shrimp scampi was dry. There was not enough sauce on the the plate to coat the pasta.  I was eating dry pasta and choking on it. I didn't even eat 25% of the pasta because it was dry and choking to swallow.

When we arrived, we got a table immediately. The hostess told us that was because it was cold out.  Our server was a guy that seemed in a rush. Both my son and I emphasized that we like our French fries brown/well done. I got the feeling he wasn't paying attention. After a half hour we still didn't have our food, but we had received two bread baskets. A woman came to our table to say she would take over our table. She reeked of cigarettes. We hate cigarette smoke. We asked if the order had been put in and she told us that was the case. We still waited, and after a while some food arrived. The fries looked like fast food fries. Not to Cheesecake Factory standards, and definitely not brown as requested. We asked the server to get them browned a little more, and also for the other ones to come out brown. When two more servings of fries came out, they were not well done... There were more mistakes and more waits. We ended up waiting for the check over 20 minutes. What a disappointment.
