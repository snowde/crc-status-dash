So, I wasn't too hungry this time, so I decided to order from the small plates menu.  We started with the corn fritters.  Then I ordered the shrimp and grits and my husband ordered the hibachi steak.   The only reason I didn't give them five stars is because we didn't get our appetizer until the our food was ready.  And by that time, we had already stuffed our faces with bread and butter (which is delicious)!  The server apologized for delay in bringing our app and the manager came by and didn't charge us for the corn fritters.  That was much appreciated!  We only had one of the fritters since our other dishes were in front of us and we didn't want those to get cold.   I really like the shrimp and grits.  I think the dish came with a little too much sauce...but that's just me....I just really liked the taste of the cheddar grits.  My husbands steak was really really good!  The hibachi steak is what I normally ordered.

261,Kenneth V.,"Phoenix, AZ",14,37,10.0,5.0,2012-08-19,"Today I went to this Cheesecake Factory for brunch. An event was being coordinated by the Wounded Warrior Project organization and I was to meet with other wounded warriors for a little what I thought was a meet and greet. Once I met the coordinator, she mentioned there were to be 70 attendees. Yes. Seven, zero. I braced myself for the worst. At the strike of ten the doors opened and the games began. But what happened threw me off in a good way. The manager asked for the party of 70 right off the bat and immediately had us seated in a very large area of the restaurant designated just for our event. Servers were swarming, the manager was always present, water pitchers were pouring.  Good things were happening and I was truly impressed. I don't know if they had a pep talk in the back before we came in the door and said something like,""There is a group of 70 combat injured guests and their families coming in today. Get them whatever they want and do whatever they ask"" because that is exactly what I felt like was happening. First class service. Now the food. I grabbed the Monte Cristo brunch sandwich which was egg, ham, bacon, and Swiss cheese between two thick pieces of French toast and dusted with powdered sugar. It was just as salty and sweet as you can imagine it was. It was in fact to sweet for me. Thankfully, my wife was having the Baja Chicken Hash meal which was ""Two Crisp Tortillas Topped with Chicken Chorizo, Poblano Chiles, Potatoes, Corn, Peppers, Onions and Cheese. Topped with Eggs and Hollandaise Sauce.""  I copied that from the website so hopefully they don't care but I can't explain all of what was in the meal. It was simply awesome. It was spicy and hearty with the hash browns and I loved it. So my wife and I switched dishes and were officially set. My daughter had a three pancake and bacon meal which she loved. Simple palate simply pleased. One thing to note. The orange juice was truly fresh squeezed and along with the pulp even had that slight bitter rind taste to go with it. The virtual cherry on top of the breakfast. Really, truly, good. It all really came together. 70 of us sat down and there was not a single beat missed by the staff this morning. My coffee and water never went empty. My food came promptly piping hot and tasty. There was a smile on everybody's face and I met some other great Americans and their families. I have been to this Cheesecake Factory in the past and had good service but maybe a little unremarkable. Today was an opportunity for this location to shine and indeed it did.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-peoria?start=260,3.84,3.84,3.84,3.7,3.84

Service has always been great here.  If you ask for extra's they bring it and never say anything.  When it comes to the food, Cheesecake has pretty much anything you could imagine.  Breakfast burrito? they have it.. Chinese food? they have it..  You name it, they have it. I found that sometimes, you can order an appetizer and it's the size of a regular meal.  I love their buffalo blast chicken appetizers.  it's a ton of food and it will fill you up with no problems. the one thing Ive never had luck with is their club sandwich.  Always been dry for me.   And now we talk about the cheesecake itself.  The pieces are huge and super rich.

However, this Cheesecake Factory delivers with gastronomic fireworks.  The quality of service and food were reflective of a five-star restaurant without mirroring the small portions and high prices. For instance, the pizza with salad lunch special combo was so big, even a Wooly Mammoth probably couldn't get it all down.  The burgers are also so big, I even had trouble getting my big mouth around it.  The food was exceptionally delicious.  I also highly recommend the Thai Chicken Pasta, which I usually get almost every time. Of course the ambiance inside is also very nice.  I think about 5 staff members said ""thanks for coming"" on the way out.  Hands down, this is one of my favorite chain-locations to dine at!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-peoria?start=220,3.92,3.92,3.92,3.636,3.92

214,Bill J.,"Glendale, AZ",44,173,660.0,3.0,2012-12-30,"This is another toughie for me to review, for a variety of reasons.  First of all, I like the decor and I like the ambiance of this place. It's not like most of the other restaurants (especially chains) in the area, and while pretentious, it at least outwardly appears fancier than you'd otherwise expect. There's also the lighting and a lot of windows, which is typically a plus in the early evening, so you can catch some of the sunset or watch the wind batting around the palm branches.  Food and service, however, have never really impressed me at this location. I don't know if it is specific to this restaurant or if the entire chain is this way, but after multiple visits, my honest opinion is that their menu is way, way too big. They have immense variety, but as they say, jack of all trades and master of none. Case in point, nothing I have had here has been the best, or even remotely close, compared to what I've gotten elsewhere.  I've tried the pulled pork, but I've had better almost everywhere else. Tried the burgers, but better can be had for far less money elsewhere. Appetizers are pretty much on the same page, things like pot stickers are literally no better than what you can buy in the frozen food section of your grocery store, there was nothing special about them. I've also given their pizza a try and it was some of the worst I've ever had anywhere -horrible, tasteless crust, nasty sauce and cheese that was just.. yuck. I will concede that their dessert menu does offer a few delights that I have been happy with. The milkshakes, and the strawberry one in particular, were always sinfully good. I never could finish them because they were so huge, but at least they were delicious, unlike most of the food I've had there.   In terms of service, there has been a lot of inconsistency in my visits. More often than not, it's below average service, slow drink refills and the like. Really gets my goat when I see the ""drink refill guy"" topping off every table but mine, despite the empty glass on the corner of the table, begging to be refilled. But then, he's not the server, so do you factor this into your tip? This is why I hate when restaurants job-share tables, it puts you in a position to have to punish a good server for a crappy drink service that was someone else's fault. Sigh. Bottom line, I think, is that this place is trying to be too many things at once, with the not at all unexpected result of poor execution. Their menu has to be close to 20 pages, and it really doesn't help that there are paid advertisements in it on every page too. I don't know why they see the need to generate revenue that way, but it reeks of desperation and detracts horribly from the experience of dining in a faux-upscale restaurant, even more so than half-baked service. My advice? Stay away until they slim down the menu and try to specialize, or at least only go for the desserts. The rest of their food is just adequate, at best, and definitely overpriced for what it is. Combined with the unpredictable service, I just don't see any reason to go back here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-peoria?start=200,4.12,4.12,4.12,3.2440000000000007,4.12

We ordered from the lunch menu.  I got the Miso Salmon and my husband ordered the cheese pizza.  Our food was out within 15 minutes and mine was delicious, but my husband said his pizza was just so-so and about the same quality as a cheese pizza from Sam's Club.  (OUCH!) Anyway, our bill for two passion fruit iced teas, a lunch pizza, a lunch salmon and a slice of the pina colada cheesecake (to go) was $42, before gratuity.  The baby just ate off of my plate because she is too little for her own plate still. I ate the pina colada cheesecake slice later that night and it was just okay.  It may just be me, but I think that their more exotic cheesecake flavors aren't nearly as good as the plain old vanilla bean cheesecake.  Maybe it's because the other ingredients in the more exotic cheesecake varieties detract from their perfect vanilla cheesecake recipe...?  I dunno what it is, but I've experienced this phenomenon more than once.  Sadly this time I thought it'd be different with the promising pina colada flavor, but it just didn't deliver.  It didn't taste very tropical, or very cheese-cakey.  I'll just remind myself to order the plain vanilla cheesecake next time and stop being drawn in by the tempting siren song of the exotic cheesecake flavors.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-peoria?start=140,4.2,4.2,4.2,3.152,4.2

I think ""oh great, this should be an adventure"" -- boy was I right. Took over an hour for 2 lunch portions and an appetizer for our table. Nothing complex, either (2 fish and chips and a baked artichoke). It seemed that the waitress had no concept of time -- likely because she was standing at the bar just inside talking to her coworkers while we burned up on the patio waiting for food. She also failed to bring out condiments we asked for -- I would have reminded her, but the next time we saw her, she was bringing the checks. I may not have cared so much if I wasn't on a lunch break, but when it's business lunch hour, you'd think the waitstaff would try to acknowledge that. $20 for lunch with slow service and average food is never worth it.

When it came time to order, we were broken up into groups on how we'd be paying.  I ordered the same thing I've gotten for years, Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps (from the appetizer menu).  My mom and sister both ordered the same.  The waiter told us about a lunch special but I told him, ""No, I prefer to make the wraps myself"" (as did my sister and mom).  About 20 minutes later, food was delivered, only it wasn't what we ordered.  They sent the pre-made lunch menu wraps.  The waiter told us that it was what we ordered.  Ummm, ""No, I distinctly told you the other wraps.  It's what we wanted and what we have always ordered in the past.""  My sister wasn't willing to wait longer, she took what the waiter brought for her.  My mom and I sent the dishes back.  The waiter said our food would be out shortly.  So, 15 minutes later, out came the manager, apologizing and telling us food would be out soon.  He left the other two orders of wraps and said we could share them with the group, he said he didn't want to throw them out.  Okay, 30 more minutes and still no food.  Finally, as everyone was ready to order their desserts, I called over our waiter and cancelled our lunches.  I ordered a strawberry shortcake--which did come out.   I was thoroughly disappointed.  The discord was evident between the waiter and the manager (who we were told was brand new to the location).  The manager was polite, but the waiter gave us a disgruntled earful.   It was sad, my sister and I were only in town a very short time, this was supposed to be a fun outing, seeing old friends and having what should have been an enjoyable lunch.   Were this my only experience with The Cheesecake Factory, I would likely never return.  I do know that they are usually much better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-peoria?start=240,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.6600000000000006,3.1600000000000006

We did get our drinks waited another 10 minutes  for her to come back and get our order. Everyone around us was given bread we had to ask twice before she remembered to bring it. Someone else brought out the food . It was good. But never got a refill or did she check to see of we needed anything else . Then when we she brought the check we ask about dessert she said u want it Togo . We said no then she was like oh ok .

They were extremely salty. The rolls came with a peanut sauce and a soy type orangey sauce. For it not being a Vietnamese place, it was not too shabby!

I've tried a variety of things, the meatloaf dinner (yum), chicken & biscuit dinner (blah- won't order again, plus the biscuit was a rock), the brunch French toast is a favorite of mine ( yum, it's usually when we go visit), California omelet (on our most recent visit... The avocado was actually guacamole, no cheese on top- only inside- which didn't seem like much at all & I had ordered extra- so that was disappointing. The inside not mixed well, as I went through the omelet, I'd go from one ingredient to another.. Also they don't cut up the cherry tomatoes & I cut into one on my 1st bite into the omelet where a cherry tomato happened to be, which burst and squirted my face & eye, which was painful!)  So overall, I'm not super impressed with this place. It's ok. Dessert to-go or pick-up is good. We love the carrot cake, I've ordered a whole one before. For my husbands 30th birthday. Yum!

Complaints: It took over an hour to get our lunch of sandwiches and salads... the salads did not come out first as requested....they served the food one plate at a time over a15 minute period so we were not eating together. ....  and we still did not have the coffee we ordered by the time our food came out.   We went to the restaurant about 2 in the afternoon between the lunch and supper rush. The restaurant was not busy,  and many tables were available.  We were told we'd be seated in about 5 minutes.  At 2:20 they finally gave us a table. We ordered quickly as there was a plane to catch.  Our meals were simple.  Beef a jus sandwich,  chicken Caesar salad,  grilled chicken dinner with salad, and a club sandwich with a salad.  At 2:55 I asked to speak with a manager as our salads were not out yet and we still had not received our coffee.. At at 3:10 they brought the chicken dinner and salad out together.  At 3:15 they brought out the Ceasar salad and club sandwich.  Several minutes later they brought out the beef sandwich and the salad that went with the club sandwich.  Needless to say we did not have time to eat all of our food or drink the coffee. The manager came over and asked if we wanted a cheesecake.  I said,  are you kidding me?  No,  we don't even have time to eat or meal.  We have to leave.  He said, ""I'm sorry if you feel we did something wrong.  If you want to order cheesecake,  it can be packaged to go.

The manager never offered any discount on this $95.00 lunch,  not even on the coffee that we didn't get to drink,  and his apology was as lacking as the poor service.  He didn't apologize for bad service or a failure to get our salads out before our meal.  He said he was sorry that WE FELT they did something wrong.  I will NEVER recommend this restaurant to anyone, or eat at another cheesecake factory.  They lost 4 customers today as will as any guests we might have brought them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-peoria?start=180,3.16,3.39,3.39,2.5320000000000005,3.298

I ordered the Bruleed French Toast and he ordered the Farm Fresh Eggs, scrambled/well, with potatoes, toast, and bacon (meat is extra). We planned to share so we could have a little of everything. I was surprised that they brought out the complimentary bread before our brunch, but it was almost lunchtime. I sure do enjoy the honey oat bread. Sourdough is alright too. When our food came out, I took a bite of the French toast and was instantly turned off by the mushy consistency. It's so thick and, I'm sure, soaked in egg. It was not appetizing to me. My boyfriend offered to switch plates since he'd had it before and liked it, so we did. The eggs were fine and maybe had a little seasoning to them. Most of the potatoes were crunchy, so I was not impressed. The bacon was really dark red in color and very crispy. I don't know if that means it is extra lean?? The toast was really not necessary after all the bread I had just eaten... Overall I was not pleased with this meal, especially for the price! And I had a stomach ache afterwards. There are so many other places I'd prefer to get breakfast food. Our server did not really have a sense of humor either. We did get a couple slices of cheesecake to go, for good measure. Vanilla Bean and Lemon Meringue. Unfortunately the meringue had melted off the top by the time we got it home... The vanilla bean tasted a lot like vanilla ice cream. So it was good, but even half a slice was too much. The lemon meringue was rather tart but the whipped cream helped to balance it out.

We arrived at around 3:00 and there weren't too many people there.  We got a seat immediately at a table and the waitress brought over the high chair.  We placed our order for drinks (waters, and my wife got an iced tea), got some bread delivered (sourdough and a honey oat type brown bread) and placed our order.  I had been scoping out the Yelp reviews and pictures online prior to arrival, and I saw a few pictures of fish tacos.  I had yet to have fish tacos since I moved to AZ, and they looked legit, and sounded legit, so I went with those.  My wife got a lunch sized portion of the pasta carbonara with chicken.  About 15 minutes later, our food was arrived.  Here is how it was.................. Fish Tacos-  These things looked great!  They hook you up with 4 nice sized tacos!  They came with double wrapped corn tortillas, a nice piece of tempura fried white fish which was both crunchy outside and moist inside,  some pickled onions and a little dollop of guacamole.  They usually come with a chipotle sauce, but I skipped that.  The tacos were mighty fine as they were.  Everything worked well!  They were legit fish tacos.  Maybe not as good as TJ Oyster Bar in SD, but they were damn good and better than a lot of fish tacos I have had.  I really liked the pickled onions!  They gave a nice little sweetness to the taco and they were buried under the actual fish.  These tacos were well constructed and just the right size to fill me up but not overstuff me.  The tacos also came with some black beans, and a side of ""green tint"" rice.  I sampled the beans, they were alright.  The rice had a unique seasoning to it.  Almost tasted a bit like pesto sauce, but then I caught a taste of something else.  Definitely unique, but I didn't finish all of it, mostly because I'm not the hugest fan of rice and/or beans. Pasta Carbonara-  My wife thought it was a bit too ""oily"" so she couldn't finish it all.  I took her bowl of pasta from her and proceeded to have some.  I thought it was fine!  It had a nice sauce, lots of bacon, a little bit of chicken and a ton of peas in it.  I am anti pea, so I ate around all of those.  The noodles, bacon, sauce and chicken were very good.  I couldn't see myself eating a whole bowl of this (reason my wife couldn't finish it either) because it was pretty heavy, but a half portion or if you split this with someone, it was pretty tasty. Service was fine.  Not great, not poor.  A-OK!  Total for everything was $0.00 thanks to the gift cards!  We skipped dessert and were on our way.  I would definitely come back and probably order the same thing.  Those fish tacos were no joke!  They were delicious as could be!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-peoria?start=60,3.16,3.21,3.21,2.9280000000000004,3.19

I order two appetizers the sliders and the loaded potato puffs to share with my 1 year old and explain not to bring them out as an appetizer but with my boyfriends entree which was to be a burger and fries. Guess what? Got my appetizers early and my half got cold as I waited for his meal to appear, when it did appear we were told they were waiting on his fries and they would be right out, they never came and instead of following up our waitress walks by,sees he is done with his burger and asks if he would like her to take his plate.

We planned this evening out right after Christmas when we received several gift cards from family.     The place was pretty busy, but we decided to stay. We were seated promptly which was very nice. We were told that someone would be with us shortly as usual. After 10 minutes and 2 birthday celebrations we were both shocked to find that no one was tending to us. We decided to just wait and see if someone would be coming to our table then. Seems we were seated at a bust time maybe? After 22 minutes I got up and went to the gal that seated us. I let her know that we had been sitting there the whole time with no one to tend to us. Immediately the manager turned around and apologized. Promised to make our evening very nice. As we walked to the table I noticed a server talking to my Husband. We agreed to stay and attempt to enjoy our visit.    I know things happen and you can't take it personally. We didn't. I'm glad we stayed because our server and the manager took really good care of us. Our server was very friendly and made us feel better. We respected her and gave her a fair opportunity. We had the calamari for an appetizer. It was brought to our table immediately. It was hot and fresh. The 2 sauces were delicious. We will order it again!    I had the skinny chicken pasta and Hubby had the chicken di pana. Both dishes were very tasty. We both enjoyed our dishes, but wish we had switched plates at some point. We decided to share a piece of Kahlua cheesecake and take a piece of the lemon meringue cheesecake home. Great idea!     Even though our evening started out rough, the service and food was worth it all. Our server and the manager definitely made our evening very enjoyable and fun.

Please note this sandwich was $14 and I could have got a better sandwich at Subway Arby's or any Delicatessen. Normally I would not have been so bothered as much if it would have been for the poor attitude of my waitress. When I pointed it out to her she said ""so you hit the skin of the onion I will let the kitchen know"".  Then she asked if there was anything else she could do for me today or if I was ready for my check.

93,Jessica G.,"Long Beach, CA",86,157,204.0,1.0,2016-07-15,"Went on 7/14 (Thursday) for a friends 19th Birthday. It was only a party of 4, we waited about 20 minutes which is normal since it was about 8ish. Our ""waiter"" was by far the worst I've ever experienced at any establishment. It took him a while to get to our table to take our drink requests. Which was okay seeing as we determined what to order. When he FINALLY came over he took our drink orders then started to walk away with out acknowledging he was going to be right back. I said ""I think we're ready to order"" and he turned back around and said ""I have other tables to attend to!"" First of all. What the heck. I've never in my life have I had to deal with such a mannerless individual, especially in the food/customer service industry. 15 minutes later he finally arrives with our drinks and again walked away with no acknowledgement. Another 15 minutes later he finally felt like taking our order and finally gave us a bread basket which only had two slices of bread. Reminder there's a total of 4 people in our party.  You could clearly tell he was in a bad mood and was taking it out on his guests. He took our order and my friend asked for a burger with no onions and mustard. She got it backward with onions and no mustard. When she told the ""waiter"" he didn't even right it down and barely acknowledged her simple request. At this point we were very upset at how much of a jerk this guy was being and totally took away from our birthday celebration. We ate or food and at the point when we had already finished he finally comes around to ask how food was. Like really? Usually you get asked about 5 min later.  We were so pissed we didn't even get a cheesecake which was the only reason we wanted to eat there in the first plAce. Not that the ""waiter"" even offered us any dessert in the first place. If your having a bad day leave your issues at the door or if you hate your job then promote yourself to customer. But goodness cheesecake company should be ashamed of this specific worker!! Who knows how many other people ruined their dinners as well.  Also, I can't begin to describe how filthy our table and area was!!!! There was some type of slime stuff on the floor that my friend stepped in and had dirty shoes. We all had to watch where we stepped for the floor under or table was so nasty and obviously not cleaned or mopped. What a joke.

I love eating at cheesecake factory I love their food I love their bread and especially the cheesecakes  But for some reason this location has now disappointed me twice. Total bummer bc well my fiancé and our kids love coming here a.k.a. they love the bread lol!  So we first went to this location two weeks ago.. We were a huge party of 10 which was fine  you know it was dinner time no complaints on our waiter... I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps or as they call them lettuce tacos. Nothing taco about only taco thing was it came out in the weird taco holder stand..this is where I don't understand what happen I ordered chicken lettuce wraps I would expect there to be chicken in my lettuce wrap not one little sliver of chicken probably 1 inch long I want chicken I'm hungry! So already I'm disappointed. We came back here the other night and our kids food(they get the kids pizza) was fine my fiancé's food was phenomenal(he usually gets the steak or salmon) and my food again not so great. I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken which I've ordered at other Cheesecake factory's and I've never had this issue that my chicken crusted Parmesan was soggy. Usually it's thin crispy not this one soggy like it was old and warmed up ... Crazy part is I know not to order those items again bc I know we will be back... Just I know for next time..

27,Stefanie P.,"Surprise, AZ",51,114,157.0,4.0,2016-10-22,"We've been here many times over the years. I like the large selection of food to choose from. Salads, burgers, pasta, tacos, burritos, sandwiches, meatloaf, Indian inspired... pretty much anyone should be able to find something here. A lite menu that is extensive and vegetarian options. I love the ""bang bang chicken and shrimp"" (chicken, shrimp and veggies in a delicious peanut sauce topped with rice and toasted coconut), their burgers and ceasar salad with grilled salmon. They have a salad with a wide variety of julienne cut veggies that is really good. I've had chicken tacos and have been pleased. I can't think that I've ever been unhappy with my meal there. My kids and husband are always happy too. To drink, I like the iced green tea with mint leaves. Ok, the important part... CHEESECAKE! My personal favorites are the Oreo cheesecake and the Adam's Favorite (a delicious peanut butter and chocolate fudge cheesecake). I've also had the pumpkin pecan cheesecake  (the crust is too hard, we got this on our last visit and weren't impressed), red velvet cheesecake, carrot cake cheesecake, white chocolate raspberry... probably others too. I mean, it's cheesecake, how bad can it be? Usually the cheesecake does not disappoint.  The service can be hit or miss. We are usually happy, but last night our server just really didn't seem like he wanted to be there and we didn't get great service because of it. Also, I don't like when we are seated at a small table adjacent to other tables (one side shares a long booth type bench), I feel that it lacks privacy because we can hear everything that is being discussed by the parties on either side of us.

I'm not a stranger to this chain. I'm sure I can count the number of visits to this and other locations on more than two hands. It's been maybe a year since my last meal at a Cheesecake Factory. Last Saturday evening I arrived ahead of my company and the parking lot was full. The lobby was even worse! So when I put my name down for three and was told the wait would be only 30 minutes, I was surprised. And when they paged me to seat us after only 20 minutes, I was shocked. First available, on the patio next to a heat lamp, thank you very much! Cheesecake Factory has a reputation for having a notoriously HUGE menu. The upside is, they have something that appeals to nearly everyone. And I can honestly say, no matter what I was craving while at a Cheesecake Factory from Chandler Fashion Square to Arrowhead, I've always been highly impressed. This meal was no exception. I wasn't feeling very hungry and I wanted something a little healthier than my usual fare. My friend Alex recommended the White Bean Chicken Chili. Knowing that my company eat here more than I do, I took the recommendation. It was the perfect entree for a cold night in January. Not to mention healthy and filling. I was very impressed with the other items on their lighter menu too. Besides consistently delicious meals, the Cheesecake Factory also delivers them with excellent service in a classy environment.

I returned them and asked for a fresh plate. The next plate they were very small and dry. Just nowhere near the size or quality I expedited, so I returned them. The manager came and apologized and asked if he could anything to make it better. My wife'se tacos were very small as well, and the tortillas were not the same as the ones used at other locations. Our friend that went along with us said her sandwhich was also very small. Server n didn't bring out bread. Lame. Great manager, but I won't return.

Problem #1: I called two weeks in advance and was told they don't make reservations for the time I was requesting and to come in 45 min early and I should be fine. I advised them it is a group of 20 and she said it was fine. Okay, so I came in 45 min early (4:15pm) and was quoted an hour by the manager. An hour and a half goes by and we are still waiting. I then speak to the manager and told him he quoted me an hour and it's well over an hour. He apologized and said we were waiting for another large party to leave because that's where we would be sitting and that he would have appetizers waiting for us.  Problem #2: If you are telling people to just walk in with big parties then why don't you just take reservations to avoid getting slammed and you can prepare for it?! COMMON SENSE. Problem #3: You shouldn't wait on a party to leave and expect them to leave in a timely manner because for all we know they can sit there and chat for another hour and you can't force them to leave!   We finally got sat at 6:00 pm. The appetizers did come out about 10 minutes after we got sat which helped a little. The food seemed to take awhile but I get it was a big party, so kind of expected but the problem I had was my mom and little brothers food never came out. I advised the server and she's like it should be out shortly they are finishing up. Ummmm I actually don't even think they put their order in because my whole table was done eating and they were still waiting on their food! The manger came over and apologized AGAIN and said it would be take care of and gave my mom a free slice of cheesecake. I mean that's fine and all but my mom had to take her food to go because we were already there for 3 hours and everyone was ready to leave. Honestly, worst service ever! Never coming here again and will take my large parties somewhere else.  Cheesecake factory should allow reservations all the time. This will help and people will not have to wait foreverrrrr.  OH and the least the manager could of done was give ME a free slice of cheesecake as it was my 25th birthday and we waited almost 2 hours to be sat!

8,Kemlyn B.,"Glendale, AZ",411,510,1842.0,4.0,2017-03-22,"Delicious food, pretty ambiance and rich flavors. As a part of our Spring Break food vacation, my daughter and I used a gift card that a friend treated me to last year. We decided to enjoy a three course lunch and split our meal because we knew we'd be too full if we had our own entree.  Our server, Paisley checked on us a couple of times while we waded through the long menu. We had a hard time deciding so we started backwards. We chose the white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake. Then we ruled out steak and fish for a pasta dish. We considered the mini crab cakes, burger sliders and spring roll sampler, but after choosing the Pasta Carbonara, we decided that a lighter starter would complement the meal better. Our server came back with warm dark wheat loaf with oatmeal and ciabatta bread with real butter. Yummy! My daughter wisely cautioned, ""Don't fill up on bread, Mom! We will have a lot of food coming."" Our server brought fresh extra plates for us to share our salad and pasta. The Caesar Salad was terrific. The lettuce and croutons were crisp. Our server ground fresh pepper on our salad. The dressing was spicy and made from scratch. They were also generous with the Parmesan cheese. Our second course was the Pasta Carbonara. The chunky bacon was crisp and still had a nice bite and chew to it. It was smoky and cut through the creamy garlic Parmesan sauce that was a slight heavy on the olive oil. Still, it was super delicious. I enjoyed the green peas and the pasta was cooked beautifully al dente. Tip: While grilled chicken could be added to either the Caesar Salad or the Pasta Carbonara, I have learned that chicken does not always enhance the flavors of these lovely dishes. I did not regret not adding chicken this time. The dressing was the star of the salad, as was the smoky bacon in the pasta. Finally, our dreamy cheesecake came out with an extra mound of whipped cream. The raspberry ribbon was tart and refreshing. The chocolate base had a nice dark chocolaty flavor. The cake was exactly what a chilled cheesecake should be. Of course, it was dressed with fresh shavings of white chocolate. The company was great. The restaurant was quiet enough for me to enjoy our table conversation. The food was surprisingly good especially a chain restaurant. Our server was attentive. I enjoyed my meal and would not mind repeating it soon. Our tab for our 3 course shared meal was $33.

138,Brandon S.,"Goodyear, AZ",0,8,,2.0,2017-06-18,"Went here for Father's Day and must say it was very disappointing.  When we walked in there was a 30-40 minute wait for any inside tables and no wait for outside. We checked outside and it was warm but comfortable and didn't plan on spending much time at the restaurant.  Once we were seated on the patio it took about 5 minutes before anyone even came to get our drink order. We placed our drink orders and then waited another 10 min or so.  We got our drinks and some bread (even though we asked for extra) and then ordered very simple dishes. As it was Father's Day there were other families nearby, and I watched as food came out to another table one plate at a time.  They then told the father his would be out in a few minutes, ten minutes later he gets his food and I was like wow that's horrible on Father's Day.  Then we waited and  waited and the same thing happened to us after being there for an hour.  Two of the five orders came out, then two more a few minutes later. Then my dish came out and he described it as a lunch size pasta and I said I didn't realize I had ordered a lunch size because I had not, I also noticed that it did not have the chicken in it that it was supposed to have.  I said it was fine due to waiting an hour and just asked if I could get the chicken. He took the dish back and then came back to say that our server made a mistake and  they are going to make a new one and it would be out in a few minutes. 15 min later it comes out after my family had pretty much finished their meals.  I asked the server why everything was taking so long and he said ya know the Father's Day brunch and whatnot, which didn't make sense because the patio was only 1/4 full.  Anyways the pasta is the one I get every time and the sauce was like soup.  After being on the patio for over an hour and a half it was time to go as the sun had been hitting us and we should have been out of there a lot sooner.  Definitely not the most enjoyable Father's Day experience which is a huge let down as it is one of our favorite places.  Not sure if we will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-peoria?start=120,2.68,2.91,3.212,2.9200000000000004,2.8180000000000005

Everyone was happy with their food, it was seasoned pretty well and everything came out correctly. We ordered our cheesecakes to go and got those fairly quickly too. I was pretty happy with tonight because it was busy but we didn't feel forgotten or like we were a burden to our waitress.

He did like his onion soup. I ordered shrimp with angel hair pasta. I thought that is what I ordered. I showed the waiter on a particular page. I showed him shrimp with angel hair pasta but when I was served my lunch, it looked odd. It was soggy breaded shrimp on the side in little sauce, burnt sauce pieces and whole garlic cloves and a Luke warm ball of the pasta. The shrimp coating was pasty/soggy and had a weird flavor. I flagged the waiter and we reviewed the ordering/food quality situation. We decided I ordered the Scampi which has the breaded shrimp and whole garlic cloves. Whatever. He brought me 6 nicely sauteed shrimp which was brought after I ate the slightly warm ball of pasta. I didn't want to complain too much as to not further make my husband uncomfortable. It is hard enough that he needs gluten free so I was clear and took blame for the wording of my order though what I was pointing to and reading from the menu was not the item I was served. Even though I told our waiter the pasta was not hot, he did not offer to fix that. They were also out of soup spoons and offered my husband a tea spoon or a pasta (large spoon). Very weird. That happened when I had soup there 3 months ago. The ladies restroom was dirty and trash can over flowing with trash on the sink and floor. I let them know the ladies room needed attention as I was leaving. The waiter was very nice and 80% attentive. It was an expensive lunch. Not sure if we will go back.

The meal came with three thin chicken strip sized pieces of fish that in addition were each very bland. Moving on to my dish, the gumbo, I found the consistency to be very water like and the only flavor that came through was the tomatoes and the few pieces of andouille sausage. However, the rice was cooked nicely and the sides that came with the catfish were fine as well!

The restaurant was immaculate in appearance as expected.  The (MAJOR) problem was (unfortunately) the food.  My wife ordered us the buffalo wings appetizer.  When they arrived at our table the presentation was spot on, however, when we bit into the wings we were both disgusted by the fact that the wings were RAW on the inside. Now, let me be clear, when I say they were RAW; they weren't slightly undercooked, they were DRIPPING WITH BLOOD!!! We immediately brought it to the attention of our server whom, by the way, was just as shocked and disgusted as we were.  She was very apologetic and she politely gave us two options, order a different appetizer, or, she could put in a new order for freshly COOKED wings.  We opted for the latter, as we assumed it was just an oversight by the preparer/cook. Unfortunately, the second order was not very different from the first order.  How hard is it to cook some wings??? The server was made aware of the fact that the the second set of wings were STILL undercooked. (An assessment that she, too, shared.  She advised us that she would bring the matter to her managers attention.  Ultimately, she removed the wings from our bill.  I was surprised that the MOD (manager on duty) NEVER came over to our table to apologise to us.  There is NO DOUBT in my mind, that that is POOR MANAGEMENT. Next issue: Both my wife and I each ordered a rib eye steak for our entree', BOTH COOKED MEDIUM TEMPERATURE.  My Rib Eye steak arrived OVER COOKED. My wife's Rib Eye steak arrived cooked perfectly MEDIUM.  There is nothing worse than people seated in the same party ordering identical meals, cooked the same way, served differently!!  I WAS LEFT TO COVET MY WIFES STEAK, and we all know what the Bible says about coveting.  To make matters worse, that night, I was sick ALL throughout the night! I was in the bathroom (like the famous song of Lionel Ritchie says) all night long.  There is NO question in my mind that it was the bloody buffalo wings that made me sick.  We have eaten at this particular Cheesecake Factory on numerous occasions. This was the 1st time that the food made me SICK.  I implore the kitchen manager, general manager, assistant managers, and food expediter(s) to PLEASE, MAKE SURE THAT FOOD IS COOKED PROPERLY.

The food is pretty consistent from one of their restaurants to another and this location was no exception. Came here on a dinner date sometime between 4-5 pm. Parking was hard to find, so had to park toward the very back.  When we stepped into the restaurant we thought we'd be waiting around for a long time since there were lots of people waiting to be seated, but we were surprised to be seated immediately. We were seated close to the kitchen where it was super loud. Kept hearing things being dropped on the floor.  Our waitress came by quickly and took our drink order, brought it back quickly along with some fresh warm bread with butter. I love the dark bread that they bring out. Not sure what kind it is, but it was soft and has a bit of a sweet taste to it. Their sourdough bread was hard and dry, barely edible! After about 10 minutes she came back to take our food order.  I ordered the Crispy Beer Battered Fish tacos that came with 3 street tacos, rice, and black beans. The tacos were delicious, but not much to them. Each taco had a small piece of fish, avocado, tomatoes, onions, cilantro and a chipotle sauce. Rice was good, well cooked and seasoned. I think it was a cilantro rice, but can't certain about that. Black beans were tasty as well. Cost $15.50. My guest got the Fettuccini Alfredo. The noodles were well cooked, not overcooked or undercooked. The sauce was tasty, however, it wasn't anything special. It tasted like something you could've gotten at the store. They did give plenty of sauce on the noodles. This cost $16.95. We planned on getting some cheesecake to go, but when we left, the line for ordering cheesecake was super long.  Pros: 1. Our waitress was nice. 2. Food was good. 3. Nice location and easy to find. 4. Large menu to choose from. Cons: 1. Too busy at this location. 2. The waitress came by only once during the time we were there. She seemed overwhelmed with the number of tables she had to attend to.  3. Prices keep going up on their food. The main reason why I don't come often. For two people, without getting drinks or dessert costs over $30 plus tip and we didn't even get the ""expensive"" items on the menu.  4. Very loud. It was so loud at dinner time that I could hardly hear myself think, let alone hear what my date had to say. There were noises from the kitchen, the staff singing Happy Birthday 3 times, kids and babies crying and screaming, and then just the normal noise of people talking.  Prices and how loud this place was, making my dining experience not as nice is what makes my review a 3 star instead of a 4 star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-peoria,3.32,2.95,3.232,,3.098

I had to park all the way in the back on a Saturday afternoon. Once I got inside, there were at least 20 people waiting to be seated and the place looked like every available table was taken up. How I love The Cheesecake Factory, but the wait line is always so long!!! Once I was seated I had to wait for about 10 minutes before my waitress came around to even take my drink order. I knew she was very busy, so I just ordered a water. Once she came back with my drink and brought me some bread, she took off again to tend to more tables. After about another 10 minutes she came back and took my food order. I got the Fettuccine Alfredo. Delicious, but cost $17 which to me wasn't worth it as it was just basic and nothing special about it. I could have made it at home for way less.  Other than the food, my experience wasn't the best. The place was so loud I couldn't hear myself think. There were screaming kids, pots and pans banging around in the kitchen and just your average noise of people talking in a crowded space.

Food is mediocre at best and I've been to other locations and they ALWAYS fell short. The free bread  and water was the only thing good. But anyways, this experience was by far one of the worst.  I came to celebrate my graduation with my bf and he has never been to The Cheesecake Factory. I kinda warned him that it wouldn't be the best food and that everything was overpriced but I just wanted him to experience it and the cheesecake is usually pretty good (as one would hope right).  He ordered a burger well-done and it came out extremely pink inside but somehow the outside of the patty was incredibly charred. I ordered the jambalaya with pasta and the pasta was incredibly overcooked. As I pulled on the noodles they stuck together and tore apart. I had a couple bites and it was mush. The protien was good, the chicken and shrimp but the pasta was unpalatable.  I am just so disappointed about the dining experience. Didn't come in expecting much but didn't expect it to be THAT bad. The manager was completely cooperative and even said straight up that he can tell we weren't enjoying our experience. He and the waitress insisted they could have the food redone but I just wanted to leave!! He ended up comping us for the two entrees. I was not gonna pay $20 for a a plate of mush noodles and my bfs  $15 burger that was almost raw inside. Even the appetizer we got was not worth $6. Lol truffle bacon cheese sticks. Basically a sandwich with a thin peice of cheese and bacon cut up into 5 pieces.  Still left a tip. Not a great one but still a tip nonetheless. Overall, was a complete waste of time and I'm not one to complain like that but i was so disappointed I wanted to just get up and leave. Wish I would have taken a picture but I didn't even think to.

59,Kevin S.,"Surprise, AZ",0,5,,2.0,2017-10-17,"I took my family of four here this past Sunday for lunch.  The best part was the fancy building, but that's about it.  My wife ordered french toast. She didn't like it...too much bread and lacking in flavor.  My son ordered a Belgian waffle and liked it.  I ordered hot wings from the appetizer menu.  I would say they were ok. Nothing special...a little dry and not very spicy.  My daughter ordered steak Diane.  She was disappointed....3 shrimp, sticky mashed potatoes, and small portion of steak pieces, many of the pieces under-cooked.  The waitress seemed as if she had too many tables to cover.  We rarely saw her and she really wasn't that pleasant.  After the meal was served by kitchen staff, nobody came around to ask how things were.  The icing on the cake for me was when my wife and daughter wanted Oreo milkshakes to-go.  Took an extra 15 minutes and they were brought to us in cheap little plastic cups.  They seemed like they had sat for a while and had started to melt a little.  When the bill came, I was shocked to see a $95 dollar bill.....way too much for what we ordered!  The only expensive meal was my daughter's steak at $22.  Each of the pathetic milkshakes was $8.  Seriously?  My wife and son each had what I would call a cheap breakfast.  This meal should have cost no more than $50 at most.  I paid the bill and we proceeded to drive home.  The more I drove, the more upset my wife and I became.  I hate wasting money...which is exactly what I did.  My wife said that I should drive back and tell someone, but I declined.  I wasn't optimistic that management would care.  My family felt bad.  I told them that they are worth $100, but the meal I just paid for was certainly not.  I guess that YELP is my way to vent a little.  I told my family that next time, we should just go to Denny's if they're going to order simple breakfast items and I'll save $60.  I'm still angry about paying almost $20 for two puny milkshakes.  That's absurd!  I object to paying a premium price for sub-par service and mediocre-level food.  I still haven't decided if I will ever be back.  I'm pretty frustrated right now.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-peoria?start=40,3.2,2.93,3.188,,3.0380000000000003
32,Jez D.,"Deer Valley Village, Phoenix, AZ",0,4,,1.0,2017-10-18,"I typically love The Cheesecake Factory, but lately their service is terrible. Last Saturday my husband and I ate there around 9pm. We had a nice, older, dark haired lady as our server. She was friendly, but absolutely clueless. First sge brought out loaded potato soup and forgot the bacon. We waited 10 minutes for the bacon and the soup was cold. Then I had a bbq burger and she forgot the sweet potato fries, so I was left to wait 10 minutes for fries and by then my husband had finished his catfish. Needless to say, I ate alone while my husband waited for me to eat. This all happened after already waiting 30 minutes for our food, even though the place was dead! The only positive things I can say is that I enjoyed the Strawberry Creamsicle and potato soup. This restaurant is too overpriced for the lack of good customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-peoria?start=20,3.08,2.92,3.176,,2.9840000000000004

13,Jenna M.,"Phoenix, AZ",30,3,1.0,3.0,2017-10-21,"I have been going to TCF for over 12 years in Scottsdale at Kierland. Never disappointed. We got the fish tacos, fried shrimp platter and 2 slices of cheesecake.  The fish tacos were extremely disappointing from this location. I've had them at Kierland and they were great. One of my tacos was 80% fried batter.  They did not give me limes like every picture has from this place, disappointing because there was a lack of flavor on the actual tacos. Only finished them because I added Cholula from home. The fried shrimp platter was decently sized buy another disappointment,  they use regular fries and Kierland uses shoestring fries which make all the difference. Next , on the tacos I asked for no beans because I have an allergy and if I could just have double rice. I only got one serving of rice. About 3/4c size. For 16$ the tacos were a huge disappointment. Considering we drove from the Cave creek area to Glendale to pick it up I guess my standards were the standards I have at the Scottsdale location. The shrimp platter 4/5 stars, even ordering extra cocktail sauce, the 2 small containers weren't enough 18$.  Fish tacos 16$ 3/5 , size, over breaded, no limes, no sour cream ,no chipotle sauce like the menu says and small rice portion . I guess I expected what I saw from other reviews in pictures, the burned tortillas and lack or toppings just made the fish dry and lack in flavor. Cheesecakes 4/5  These are definitely smaller sizes than I've had at Scottsdale and in Boulder,Colorado. Same prices. Just smaller portions .  Total bill 53$ . Overpriced for what you get.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-peoria,3.0,2.93,3.172,,2.958

Sent it back again and this time a manager comes out with the burger and said here you go I cut into it and it is still mooing at me... and the mgr decides to become argumentative with me telling me that this is well done.  I explain that most burgers that have No pink inside is well done this has pink in it which makes it medium to medium rare.

The Beringer that my wife just had literally burned going down her throat.  I sampled it and she was correct.  Not what I would expect at this type of restaurant.  Also, while I'm ranting, how about an IPA on tap?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-peoria?start=20,2.88,2.94,3.128,,2.916

The lobby was very packed with guests waiting to be seated so we knew it would be a bit of a wait but we ended up waiting to be seated for over an hour and a half. We saw families that arrived after us dine and leave even before we were seated. Food and service from waitress was good, once we were done with our meals we asked to speak to a manager. Matt came over to talk to us and as we expressed how upset we were over the waiting time he, instead of being apologetic, was very argumentative and defensive saying how that is ""normal"" for large parties. All we were hoping for was for a sincere apology since the hostess manager Brad failed to do so and to top it off didn't even seem to care that we were standing there waiting that whole time. As we were leaving three hours after arriving Brad walked past us and all he did was look at us and looked at his watch, that could of been his second opportunity to apologize for the wait time but he didn't. If you plan to come here with a large party please take your business elsewhere or be prepared to wait a long time without even being acknowledged that you're there.
