182,Amy B.,"Rochester, MI",547,1181,306.0,5.0,2012-01-12,"I love the Cheesecake Factory, and cannot say enough good things about them!  I've never been to this specific location before, but have been to a few others in the valley, and I love it every single time I go.  Weather its for lunch or dinner, with family, friends or coworkers, this place hits the spot every single time. Their menu is huge, and awesome!  TONS of great food to choose from. Dinners, lunches, and it all tastes so good!  MMM.  Lunch specials, dinners, deserts you can find everything on their huge menu.  The restaurant is quite large as well so seating is plentiful.   Today I went with my coworker during lunch, and we both walked out so full!  We got pasta lunch specials, and it was Delicious.  We were seated within a few minutes of entering, and our waitress greeted us and took our order.  She brought out bread which was hot and tasty, which we devoured.  Drinks were always filled, and we were in and out in a little more then an hour.  I got the spagetti with meat sauce, and the lunch sized one was HUGE.  I will be having leftovers for dinner, trust me! I will be returning here in the future, trust me.  Menu and food is amazing, love the atmosphere, etc.   I will say, on a side note the parking here has gotten WORSE over past few years.  I will not blame Cheesecake factory because its not their private lot, but its bad.  When I first started coming to this district, parking was open and free, with some valet service.  Then, one day, I came here last year to eat, and it was all chopped up into different pay lots.  the first lots a valet, the next lot is all token pay parking, theirs a pay parking structure in the back, and tons of ""15 minute to go"" parking around the perimeter of the center.  UM, this is a nightmare to navigate!  There's ""free"" parking but they shove you way in the back on the ""north"" side of the lot and you would spend at least 15 minutes walking to cheesecake factory if you were to have parked on that side of the mall. My advice?  Either circle 3 million times, or just drop your car off in the token paying lot down the way.  I think Cheesecake factory may even validate, but that's my thoughts... Anyways, I love you cheesecake factory and you have never failed me! MUAH!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-phoenix?start=180,3.68,3.68,3.68,3.124,3.6800000000000006

171,Chris S.,"Tempe, AZ",298,569,1415.0,2.0,2012-05-14,"Normally I never visit chains as I detest them, but on a Sunday night Mother's Day, there really was nowhere else to go. It was either between this place and Red Devil and I wish we just would have went to Red Devil instead. They do not take reservations but we were pleasantly surprised to find that the wait was non-existent on this night and we were seated right away. The waiter took our drink orders and my sister was the only one that didn't want lemon in her drink and he was kinda rude about that, something about making his job more difficult or something but whatever. The menu is huge and they have a Skinnylicious menu that features light menu items if you are watching your weight.  Pretty much anything that you could want is on the menu; italian, asian, american, etc. and let's not forget that cheesecake! The cheesecake is the one item where you cannot go wrong. OMG Red Velvet layer cheesecake is 7.95 a slice as they are all aptly priced but it is a huge slice enough for two people.  The mango passion tea is great as were their mixed drinks which are $9.25++ I got the veggie burger which was okay, nothing groundbreaking in flavor or toppings, sauces etc. The fries were a bit disappointing and the food presentation was pretty disappointing and lackluster. My mom got a turkey burger that was incredibly greasy and she was not happy with it. She asked the waiter if he was sure if it was a turkey burger and he assured her it was but again, did not get her something else or offer to take it off of the bill. So somewhat disappointing considering this is Mother's Day and I wanted my mom to at least enjoy her meal. Summary: Food so-so-may change on a variable basis, Service-abyssmal, we never even got our water glasses refilled, another waitress stepped on my sister's foot but refused to move in a timely manner. I'm going to have to pass on this one unless I need cheesecake in the near future.

I was a bit irate when they axed my favorite dish, the crispy spicy beef. Fortunately it was quickly replaced by my new favorite, the gumbo. I'm not really sure how a kitchen can specialize in every cuisine known to man but they manage to pull it off somehow. If i have one complaint, it's the excessive use of butter, which I can taste on my lips after every bite of almost every item on the menu. Then again, butter makes it better right?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-phoenix?start=280,3.52,3.52,3.52,2.9600000000000004,3.5200000000000005

Wanted to order something eat that we could share while having our cocktails.  The waitress could not recommend or guarantee anything that was gluten free.  So I just ate all the free bread and butter they brought and then we ordered dessert.  He got the ice cream sundae and I had a lemoncello raspberry cheesecake or something like that.  The waitress recommended it.  It wasn't very good at all.  I only ate a few bites because I didn't want to waste eating that many calories on something not so tasty.

This time, however, we had very nice appetizers--avocado eggroll, samosas, and beet and goat cheese salad. My main course, the spicy chicken salad, was tasty.  The appetizer portions are generous, the main course not so overwhelming and the dessert? Too stuffed to eat it so we took it home to  have tonight!

I would go back except that I know I will be tempted to try other restaurants in the area particularly the ones that aren't corporate-owned and have more interesting menus.

There were a few parties waiting outside too.  40 minutes have passed, we came inside and checked to see the status of where our name was. Apparently our pager was dead, they called our name 10-15 minutes ago. We were put off by the manager/supervisor's attitude, he was really rude.  He made it seem like it was our fault we didn't hear our names called because we were standing right outside and that our pager was dead. I saw that they were calling names inside and outside, but the only called outside every other time.  This kind customer service at the beginning set the mood for the evening...not fun. We always try to have a positive attitude, but it was kind of sad when someone that is representing the restaurant is not welcoming, we didn't really want to be there anymore. We stayed though because we are not rude.  They did seat us about a minute after. Our waiter was awkward too, but he tried.

It was literally 5 mins before I was even acknowledged (I timed it)! Then menus were haphazardly dropped on the table. I wasn't offered water and warm bread came out 5 mins later. Meanwhile, the servers were congregating, laughing and joking in the back station, which was clearly visible from my table. I finally ordered a chicken Marsala and that took another 20 mins (I also timed that), to which I jokingly replied to my server (a young, bald AfricanAmerican server with large diamond earrings) ""I thought that you forgot about me?"" His curt reply was ""It's gotta cook!""....I probably won't go back to Cheesecake Factory based on this last visit, even though it is across from where I live, even if I am craving a pineapple Mojito.

There's almost always a wait if you have a party larger than 2, even if the restaurant is empty. I don't know if they are understaffed or if there are tons many people visiting on a daily basis. Either way, call ahead if possible. This particular location has a valet, but you can easily park around the mall and walk a couple minutes if you want to save a few bucks. Servers are friendly and attentive. Restaurant is nice, big, clean - kind of reminds me of a Vegas casino. I really like the rye bread - it's soft and sweet. White bean hummus is a nice twist on classic hummus, although I think the accompanying bread was a bit stale. No biggie. I just wish I had ordered a different entree. I got the Chinese chicken salad, which is a stupid choice given their huge menu of American and European dishes. The salad tasted like the Asian chicken salad from Wendy's, but with a bunch of rice noodles on top. Sure, it's a big salad, but not worth the $14.50 I paid for it. Like I said, my own fault - order at your own risk! The crispy chicken costoletta was actually good. Once again, big portion, and the chicken was really nice.

The bread served was good, I'm always a fan of sourdough but they were hardly warm. For apps, I had the Tuna Tartare which was good, strong in flavor but the portion was way too small for something to cost $7. It came with barely enough fried off wontons to eat with the tartare. I split the Louisiana Chicken pasta and even so the portion was filling. Good pasta with a kick to eat, creamy sauce and perfectly fried chicken.  For dessert I went with something light, so I decided on the Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake. It was a bit too warm for my liking as I like my cheesecakes cold. The flavor was light and not too sweet though. Our server Brittaney was so nice and gave great suggestions! A great waitstaff here overall.

The service at this location is amazing.  The staff is extremely polite and very accommodating.  My beverage was never empty, and anything we needed, was provided (including plastic-ware for our to-go cheesecake). For having such a large menu, I am surprised at how well they prepare each dish.  My table had the Fettuccine Alfredo (which needed a little pepper) and the teriyaki chicken (which was very delicious).  Right now there seasonal pumpkin cheesecake is available.  It is the best pumpkin cheesecake I have ever had!  I would also recommend their oreo cheesecake!

189,Ken L.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,10,1.0,5.0,2014-12-24,"The other day, i took my holiday guests to share dinner at yourBiltmore location. My friends had arrived from Paris and were famished. I chose your establishment because of the extensive selection of menu items and the quality of food. It was approximately 5pm and we decided to enjoy our meal on the patio where it was relatively quiet.  Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted promptly and seated immediately. I was concerned because I didn't see anyone else eating on the patio which typically means the server sometimes can forget they have people outside. Our table was clean, music was at an acceptable level, the sunscreens were pulled down and everything seemed perfect, then...our waitress arrived and introduced herself as Nikea. At that precise moment, our experience began to change.  Granted, had been shopping all day. My guests were experiencing jet lag from their travels. Their English is not that great which required translation and patience just to get through the menu. The four of us were hungry, but we just couldn't believe nor did we ever expect what happened next. Nikea created an environment which made us feel as though we were being welcomed in her own home. Not once did we ever feel rushed nor did we feel like red headed step children for sitting on the patio. She had other tables on the inside  but somehow knew when we needed drinks or her assistance. She made reasonable suggestions and was present for our entire meal.  Although we had just met, she created an atmosphere in which I felt as though I had known her for quite some time. One might ask what exactly did she do?  Everything. Absolutely everything was perfect and exceeded my own expectations this making taking our dining experience from perfect to a remarkably extraordinary epic experience! If she isn't part of your training crew, I would highly recommend you consider making her one. Her mannerisms, attentiveness and overall professionalism was superb, but it was her personality which boosted her A game and placed a personal touch on our experience. I truly hope you take the time to share this with her. Thank you Nikea for a remarkably relaxing and memorable dining experience. Entertains guests from foreign countries who have limited knowledge of the English language is very exhausting and sometimes stressful. Thank you for making this an amazing dinner for me and my guests.  And if you are reading this to her, I hope you give her a great big hug for me right now.

205,Cory M.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,6,,1.0,2015-05-03,"Our server Georgina, took our drink orders and left. When she returned, she had forgotten to bring a tea for one of our party. Moments later, holding a tray with a cleaning rag on it, she dropped the tray just beside me and splashed both myself, and my friend sitting next to me. I absorbed most of the splatter, in my mouth, left eye, and face. She fortunately was only splashed on her body and hand. Georgina didn't even say anything to us, but picked up the tray and kept going. After a few moments of waiting, I got up and went to the restroom to clean myself off, since I didn't even have a place setting or napkin at the table. On the way back, I stopped and asked to speak with a manager. A young man with curly hair, and square framed glasses was brought to me and didn't give me his name. I told him our situation, and what had happened. I told him I could not only smell, but also taste the cleaning solution that had been on the rag and tray. At first I asked if it was bleach based, and he assured me it wasn't. Then he said he'd talk to our server, and left things at that by turning around to talk to the hostesses. Clearly, I was dismissed. So I returned to the table, disgusted, upset, and smelling of cleaning solution. My appetite was ruined at this point, so I choose not to order anything. Having chemicals splashed into your mouth, even a few droplets, will do that to a person. At this point, our friend STILL hadn't received his iced tea. We flagged down a passing server and asked her if she could bring it for him. She went back, and came out with the wrong tea. Now in this, I say it wasn't really her fault. She wasn't our server, and didn't know what type he had asked for. Correcting that issue was minor. Next up, comes our long wait for our orders to be brought out. Georgina hasn't been back to our table for at least 15 minutes at this point. Another young man stopped and dropped one basket of bread and a small dish with 4 butter pats, to serve a group of 7. Another long wait, and the table next to us, who were seated after us, and ordered after us, gets their meals. At this point, my left eye was feeling irritated, and I went to flush it out in the men's room with water as best I could. When I returned to the table, our orders were just coming out. And my roommates order was wrong. He had ordered the garlic noodles with shrimp, and NO asparagus. And he got asparagus mixed into all his noodles. At this point, he notified the food runner who had brought his dish that it was wrong. The young man said sorry, and then walked away without offering to replace or fix the order. he decided to just pick out the asparagus, and deal with it since he was hungry, and didn't feel like waiting another 30 minutes. At this point, Georgina has appeared at our table 4 times total. While refilling glassing, she is reaching directly in front of my roommates mothers face, my face, and our friend seated on the other side of the booth. No excuse me, no words at all, and STILL no apology from her for the splashing. While my friends ate, I again went to the restroom to flush my eye. I again stopped to speak with the manager from earlier, and asked him for the name of the chemical used for cleaning. He immediately told me that ""I already told you sir that we do not use bleach products here."" He furthermore told me that he had spoken to our server, and she said she didn't have any cleaning solution or rags with her when she dropped her tray. Outright calling me a liar as I see things. Please take into account, from the beginning I told the manager I didn't want anything, and wasn't asking for free meals, or drinks, or desert etc. I simply wanted the name of the chemicals used, so that I could give that information to a doctor if I felt the need to seek out treatment. He informed me that they didn't use chemicals for cleaning, and then said they used a sanitation solution. I'm sorry, but that would be a chemical. I pointed that out, and told him I was very upset with how this had all been handled. I made it clear again, that I wasn't looking for anything from him, except the name of the chemical. He asked if there was anything he could do to make my evening better, covering my meal or anything. I once more told him that I had chosen NOT to eat, after getting splashed and having that rancid taste of chemicals in my mouth. He then said he would get me the name of the solution used, after my having exhausted every other avenue, and telling him I would be contacting the corporate office. At this point, I told him I was done with the conversation, and wanted nothing more to do with him, as he clearly didn't care about the situation. The rest of our evening was spent with little service from Georgina. She had come and taken a desert order from our group while I was speaking with the manager, without even asking if I had wanted anything. Granted, I didn't. She didn't speak a word to me the entire time after the first complaint, and treated",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-phoenix?start=220,3.28,3.48,3.48,2.724,3.4000000000000004

81,Keith S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",19,21,11.0,5.0,2015-09-14,"When going to this restaurant location specifically I recommend parking in the paid parking lot across from the entrance. It will give you a little yellow token that you can validate when you are leaving and will save you the hassle of trying to find a spot in this busy location.  Now for the restaurant! This is one of my favorite restaurants to go to and the only Cheesecake Factory location I really like. The atmosphere is very lively sometimes noisy and most workers are very friendly and helpful. The lighting is rather dim in certain seating locations. I would say it is ""too romantic"" when it comes to the lighting if that was a lighting setting.  Almost all of the servers I have had in the past were great with timing, knowledge of the vast menu, friendliness and attention to your needs. The food is always great and I have never regretted my decision when ordering. The Red Sangria and Moscow Mules were perfect for drink choices. I even ordered an A.M.F. (a dangerously blue heavier alcoholic drink. Those who know understand) which was not even on the drink menu. I was surprised on how accommodating this location was. They even bring an extra plate if you are sharing a dish and have split it up before. I recommend the Shrimp Bistro Pasta or Chicken Madeira for a main entree and the Portabella, Avocado and Zucchini Fries for an appetizer. Those are just my go to choices.  The only problem, as with every other Cheesecake Factory or Man vs. Food competition, is trying to reach that last bite and in this scenario it's the cheesecake. This cheesecake is probably more total calories than all the food leading up to it and it's worth it. If you ask for a cheesecake to-go container you will put it in the fridge only to open it up before bed and finish it.

Every location has a very similar layout and decor, yet each one is uniquely different depending on the space or building it's located in.  The menu is the same though and the food is very good. Everything is very fresh and tastes great. It's a huge menu though which can be frustrating if you are hungry. We are talking everything from Asian to a simple hamburger. Not to worry though, you are going to like whatever you try.  My most recent visit I had the fried macaroni and cheese balls appetizer and a classic hamburger. Both were outstanding!  Staff is always friendly and if something isn't right, they will make it right with no questions asked. They can substitute just about anything on the menu as well.  Cocktails are pretty darn good too, there is a large cocktail menu as well.  You can also visit Grand Lux Cafe, Cheesecake's sister restaurant. Different menu, but just as extensive.

This was nice as we don't usually wait, just a habit.  Our waitress took our drink orders and gave us some time to wait for the rest of our party. When she brought our drinks she tried to drop them off and run, but I caught her and ordered an appetizer. The spinach, artichoke cheese dip was typical, nothing to rave about.  Our party arrived and her drink order was taken and delivered. When our waitress came to take our order we had been catching up and my friend hadn't gotten a chance to look at the menu so she asked if our could be put in while she took a moment to look.  The waitress walked away and I actually caught her rolling her eyes with a look of disgust on her face!  When my friend had gotten a chance to decide she called her over and gave her the order. Our order that was put in about 5 minutes earlier than hers arrived almost 5 minutes after hers.  I ordered a vegan club salad, it was great.  My husband ordered the lemon herb chicken, it was so overboard on the lemon that was all he could taste. Most definitely not worth his money.  My friend ordered the eggplant parmesan and it was so tough she had to borrow my husband's steak knife to cut it.  All in all we waited longer than was necessary but we are OK with that as we were relaxing and enjoying each other's company. The waitress must of been having a bad day, but put on a smile and wasn't rude to our faces.

97,Leah L.,"Las Vegas, NV",11,15,,1.0,2016-03-08,"We had a VERY disappointing experience here Friday night. I called just after they opened to see if I could bring in a cake for our server to bring to our table for my daughter's birthday. The manager I spoke to was pleasant and confirmed that, yes, I could bring in my own cake, and just let our server know that I had brought it in.  I took the cake and bday candles to them early in the afternoon, and the hostess who took it made a note that it was mine and then put it in their fridge up front.  Once we arrived that evening, I spoke to the hostess (on the DL, so my daughter would be surprised), and asked her to tell our server Brandon that the cake was for my daughter and to bring it out with the candles in it after dinner. The hostess followed me back to my table so she was sure to talk to the right server about the right table/party.  Dinner came and went. It was all very good, but expensive, which is expected there. Then the bill came, and I tipped about 25% because I appreciated the extra trouble of them letting me bring in my own cake, etc.  But after the server took my money, we never saw him again - and no one ever brought out her cake!! NOTHING!! After we waited a while and realized it wasn't happening, we decided to leave. When I stopped at the front and explained what happened (or what didn't happen) and asked for my cake back, the man at the counter casually handed it back without making any effort to make the situation right!!!  I was so disappointed and felt so bad for my daughter to not get the the birthday fun I thought I had set up for her.  Bad job, Brandon and Cheesecake Factory. You really dropped the ball.

136,M G.,"Beaumont, CA",0,7,,1.0,2016-03-25,"I was very hunrgy and so my family and I decided to go to Cheesecake factory. We like that they have a big menu and that the desserts are huge. But unfortunately, we ended up not having much fun at all. On a Tuesday night, we arrived at 7pm and after only 10 min., were seated at a booth, which we had requested. But the booth was so dimly lit that I could't read my menu! Literally... So after a couple of minutes I asked the waitress if we could change seats and she said if I wanted to do that I would have to get up and ask the hostess myself... to which I replied no. I do not have to get up- I have a waitress who can ask her on my behalf. She rolled her eyes and suggested that if I could;t see I should use my iPhone instead... really? How rude, I thought. Why can;t she just help me instead of trying to be sarcastic? Then the manager comes over and asks me if I would prefer a seat in the middle of the room- with hard chairs. I told him no because our family had just spent 4 hrs on bleachers at the baseball game, so I needed a more comfortable seat. (Not to mention the fact that we specifically asked for a booth from the begging and there are other booths with lights) So he told me that there was no other table. That was simply not true, as there were other tables which had light. There was no sense talking to them. The noise level was really high so I felt like they could't really hear me- or else were;t trying. I was wanting them to help me, but they were too busy to care. They basically said take it or leave it. I ended up using my iPhone and letting the kids eat... I drank water since I had lost my appetite. It's hard to want to to eat drink and be merry when you are treated like you don;t belong. I did;t bother getting drinks, or dessert, since I just wanted to leave asap.  I also tried not to be upset with the fact that the waitress barely came to our table and we had to flag her down for napkins, forks, water, ranch, bread... It was exhausting. We left disappointed. I reluctantly left a tip even though I felt like writing her a note on how to treat your fellow man. But I decided that nothing I would say could change their rude, insensitive demeanor. After all, it was such a small request and they made such a big deal out of it. Apparently business is so good that they don't have to treat customers with respect.  After that experience, I doubt I'll be back anytime soon... but that's OK... I doubt they'll miss me...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-phoenix?start=120,3.12,3.51,3.51,3.0440000000000005,3.354

146,Rebecca D.,"Phoenix, AZ",13,119,38.0,5.0,2016-09-21,Fantastic happy hour spot. Going to the Cheesecake Factory for happy hour is a real weekday treat. From 4 to 6 Monday through Friday you can enjoy drinks and appetizers for $5 each or so. I like the Mojito and the Cosmo too. My husband has had the pink lemonade drink and enjoys that a lot. The real draw here is the food. You can order many of their appetizers which usually run $10-$13 for around $5. The best part is the happy hour burger that my husband always orders. Unlike most places that only have sliders this is a full size burger and fries can be ordered with it for a dollar or two more. He loves it as he can have an adult beverage and a burger and fries for like $12. I enjoy several of the appetizers especially the shrimp spring rolls and the avocado egg rolls. There are other things on the menu I am tempted to try but I keep going back to my favorites.

All of the salads are among the best salads you can get anywhere. The Chicken Marsala is fantastic. The simple four cheese pasta is crack. Oh the salmon rice dish with a light lemon sauce will fill you up yet you'll feel good. Those suggested pasta dishes are really good. Steak and ribs was ok, yet I order that at a stake house. Fish and chips yummy. Burgers are fantastic. The size of the burrito reminds you of your first born child.

Needless to say, we ordered our salads and we ordered Ranch and got Vinagarette!  How does that happen?  RUSHING!!!!  We had to get them replaced twice. We ordered our entree's along with an appetizer.  So, I don't know what the Brea Ca location is doing right, but the other locations need to follow it.  The QA at this facility was atrocious. We tried the Fried zucchini once again and once again, let down.  There was zero, zip, nada flavor at all.  In Brea, they had awesome seasoning and were cooked perfectly.  Here it was dumped and served.  Just terrible.  I ordered the Eggplant Parmasean for my Entree.  We waited about 20 minutes only for the waitress to come back and say they were out.  How can you be out of Eggplant at lunch at 1 pm???  Again, lack of rigor and discipline in the kitchen as you should never run out of anything especially a top seller. So I had to find something else and ordered the Truffle Honey Chicken.  What a disappointment.  Two small pieces of this so called chicken were as hard as a rock.  You had a very hard time cutting it with the sharpest knife and it was un-edible as it was too hard to chew.  It was like eating rocks. The Gumbo was ok, but slopped in the bowl and lacked any presentation as well as the orange chicken. We tried to end on a good note with a piece of their new Celebration Cheesecake.  Well, unless you like Icing and I mean a lot of icing this is for you.  However, if you like a cake along with your icing this is not for you.  This was layer and layer of icing on a very, very small sliver of cake.  What a waste.  This one needs to be shelved.

18,Sarah J.,"Phoenix, AZ",19,103,34.0,5.0,2017-09-06,"The Cheesecake Factory is a well oiled, fine tuned machine. They have good food, good service, great ambiance, fun atmosphere, and reasonable prices.  The first thing you notice about Cheesecake Factory is how enormous and grandeur it is. The colors are beautiful and warm, and even though it is a huge restaurant each table feels tucked away and private. This is a great place for a romantic dinner for two, or for a giant group. There is a bar area with tvs for game watching, and a patio for when it's nice outside, so there's a place for everyone to be happy.  The staff is wonderful; everyone greets you warmly and seems to love what they do. The servers are extremely attentive, efficient, quick, and bend over backwards to make sure you are happy and get what you want. They know the menu front to back which is quite impressive considering it is about 20 pages long. The most difficult thing about eating at The Cheesecake Factory is figuring out what you want to eat. The menu is HUGE, and offers everything; pastas, steaks, gourmet chicken dishes, seafood, salads, burgers, sandwiches, wings, quesadillas, and even breakfast. You name it, most likely they have it! You would think with such a large menu the food would be mediocre, but on the contrary it is actually delicious. I have never had a bad meal here or been disappointed with a dish. They even bring out warm bread and butter to get you started. If you save room don't forget their cheesecakes, they are exceptional.  Cheesecake Factory is a great place for a solid meal any time of the day. You'll find something for everyone and you'll go home full, satisfied, and most likely with lots of leftovers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-phoenix,3.04,3.33,3.38,3.22,3.214

Parking on a Friday night is a challenge but they have valet if you don't want to circle around. When we checked in we were told it would be around 15 minutes but they had us seated in about 5. Their menu is huge. Honestly, it's too big but there is something for everyone which is nice. We started with the crispy Cuban egg rolls and the stuffed garlic bread which were both excellent, the dipping sauce for the egg rolls was delicious! There was a variety of dishes from Alfredo, salads, steak Diane, another pasta dish and my orange chicken on the table and everything looked good. My orange chicken had great flavor and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The serving size was huge so I had the rest for lunch the next day. We were all stuffed but but you can't leave without trying the cheesecake. We tried the salted Carmel and a couple of milkshakes for our younger dining counterparts. The service was excellent and our servers were very friendly and helpful.  My dinner bill for 3 with an appetizer, sodas, 3 entrees, 1 piece of cheesecake and a milkshake was $93.00 before the tip.

1,Funky D.,"Phoenix, AZ",28,119,,4.0,2017-10-09,"The Factory is winning with its appetizers. They aren't cheap, but from small plates to small salads, I don't remember having an app I didn't like.  On my latest visit, I dared to try the fried Mac and Cheese balls. I kept wavering at first, because I couldn't imagine their mac and cheese tasting any different than a box of pre-packaged stuff lurking in my pantry. But whoa! The dish knocked my socks off. Can I get an AMEN for comfort? The nicely fried balls were close to 2.5 inches round with large noodles mixed with creamy cheesy goodness. I don't know what blend of cheese is used, but I was happy that I couldn't taste american cheese. And it wasn't as greasy as you would think. The mac balls are topped with a tomato-cheese dip that also taste pretty good. Four balls cost $11.95 Avocado Egg Rolls (11.95) speak for themselves and the accompanying dip speaks for everything else:  Six half rolls per dish are served on top of some useless white crunchy sticks that I ignore every time. I forgot to ask if I could substitute lettuce for them. At least then the egg rolls would be sitting on top of something pretty. Oh well, maybe I can save packing costs by using the sticks as padding for the next package I send for X-mas. Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes (10.95): I've ordered this before and wanted to try a second time. Yes, it's a comforting dish. Sweet corn kernels are baked into three tamale pancakes and covered in garnish of avocado, pico, cream, and some kind of relish (which I just realized today) tastes very similar to Thousand Island. Would I go to the Factory without ordering cheesecake? No, no I wouldn't. Ever since I had a good run with the Struessel (which they no longer carry unfortunately) I've been tasting other flavors. This time I decided on the Lemon/Raspberry, dulce de leche, and white choco/raspberry.
