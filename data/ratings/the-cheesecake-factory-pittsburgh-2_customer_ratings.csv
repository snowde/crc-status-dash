150,Kathlene B.,"Philadelphia, PA",3,47,3.0,3.0,2012-01-16,"Food- Same as any other Cheesecake Factory.  My issue with this particular location is that they have a number of a-holes working there.  They walk by and make snide comments while you are eating.  I was there once at closing- the waitress (who was great) was a little slow with the check and I was admittedly slow giving it back, so by the time I got it back, they were officially closed.    I sat to calculate the tip and two guys come by to clean the table next to mine and remark loudly ""Man, where did the music go? Oh that's right, we're CLOSED!"" That whole thing was completely unnecessary, and the worst is that the manager was there and said nothing.  I've worked in food service and retail, so I get it, but I have never shopped anywhere, eaten anywhere, or worked anywhere where people acted like that.   I complained to the manager about it today and he was very much apologetic, which I appreciated-hence the three stars instead of two.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pittsburgh-2?start=140,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0520000000000005,3.0000000000000004

The only thing I really appreciated about the cheese cake factory is their cheesecake.

121,Will H.,"Boston, MA",109,328,429.0,3.0,2012-02-29,"As far as chain restaurants go, Cheesecake Factory is among the better choices you'll find. Yes, the menu is ridiculously large. Yes, the wait for a table is ridiculously long, but you're typically in for a decent meal...especially when you eventually find those one or two dishes that actually resonate with your own taste buds. Of course, that's not an easy task. It's a good place to take people because they have something for every taste in their menu, but until you find some go-to choices, you could easily be disappointed, as my wife and I will tell you...it's hardly worth the hour or hour-and-a-half wait, but without the wait, it's a great place for a quick bite. Also, even when you find your favorite dish, a great meal is never guaranteed. For me, the orange chicken is excellent, but it's a 50-50 toss-up whether or not they'll get my side right. I simply ask for STEAMED carrots, as I can't stand the oily vegetables the meal usually comes with, but I'm often served exactly the side I described disliking upon ordering. Generally, the wait staff that I have is nice about it, and immediately fixes it, but it's still frustrating that they get it wrong so often. Known for their epic portions, and yummy cheesecake, neither are misleading reputations. Most meals, even in lunch portion, are so gluttonous that you'll likely be taking leftovers with you. Especially at the cost, you're not going to want to just waste your meal. Aside from the few issues that I've mentioned, I've had way more positive meals and experiences at Cheesecake Factory than not. They do a surprisingly good job with almost every dish, and considering the numerous cooking styles the chefs are responsible for preparing, that's an impressive feat. It's generally a safe bet for a decent meal. Not to mention, I do like quite a few of their appetizers. The ahi carpaccio, although a little heavy on the sauces, is really good, as are the factory nachos and avocado eggrolls. My other favorite thing is the unsweetened iced green tea. I can drink that all day.  Regardless, you're probably only there for dessert anyway, and that's the one area that I've never been disappointed in. Best cheesecake ever? I wouldn't go anywhere near that far, but it's as rich and fulfilling as you'd expect, and should please the majority.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pittsburgh-2?start=120,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.9880000000000004,3.1200000000000006

118,Becky Z.,"Pittsburgh, PA",112,95,12.0,3.0,2012-03-06,"One does not simply walk into the Cheesecake Factory!  The reasons are twofold. First, the columns look like the eye of Sauron (see picture). Second, the wait for dinner is always at least 20 minutes. On a weekend night, expect to wait about 45 minutes to an hour.  Boy and I attempted to go to the CF on a Friday evening and were given an hour plus wait time. We decided to go to the Claddagh instead (but that's another review). We went back on Sunday evening, and it was still very crowded. We waited for about 20 minutes at the bar. My biggest peeve with the Cheesecake Factory, however, is the menu. It's as thick as a Dickens novel! In social science, they call the weariness one gets from having too many choices ""analysis paralysis."" I felt this in abundance.  Finally, I settled on a turkey burger with a side salad and my very lovely boyfriend chose the meatloaf.  We split an appetizer of nachos.  The nachos were ok, but they were quite bland despite it being topped with jalapenos. I enjoyed my turkey burger and salad, but my ever-so-handsome boyfriend didn't like his meatloaf much.  I think they snuck some mushrooms into it. I found it to be overly salty.  *Boy grew very upset and outwardly showed his displeasure at having mushrooms in his meatloaf. He hopped onto the table and screamed ""My PRECIOUS meatloaf!"" A waiter shortly stopped by to assuage the angry customer, but boy bit his finger off and took the ring he was wearing.  Using this one ring, boy was now free to move invisibly about the kitchen, removing every mushroom in sight. After he had completed this task, he destroyed the evil ring in a bubbling pot of artichoke dip.  Some eagles came and took us back to the South Side, having strangely been absent for the first two parts of our dining experience.* Oh, we also shared some Snickers cheesecake.

The atmosphere is great for families, friends, dates  and just anyone! And also as a bread addict, I cannot skip mentioning about their wheat and sourdough bread.

177,K D.,"Hibbing, MN",0,11,,2.0,2012-04-19,"Within the last few months I went twice while visiting Pittsburgh.  The first time I had the Miso Salmon, miso glazed salmon on a bed of brown rice with sugar snap peas.  Absolutely excellent...except that the dish contained only 5, maybe 6, snap peas.  I didn't get my veggie serving in on that meal. The second time I had the Chicken Marsala over Bow Tie Pasta.  The pasta was gummy and hard...like they only cooked it part way in prep and hoped it would cook fully after  tossing it in the pan and putting it under the hot lights -- which it was because the top layer of pasta was hardened.  The flavor was good, but there was not enough sauce.  The sauce was overly greasy, too.   It came with four tender, pounded thin, chicken breast pieces, about the 4 or 5 inches in diameter.   I ate half of it, carefully saving a lot of mushrooms (button and shitake) because they gave the most flavor to the dish plus two of the four chicken pieces, so I could have some take home in my hotel.  However, when I opened the take home container the next night, I had only one chicken piece and, literally, one slice each of button and shitake. WTF?  Where the heck did the rest of meal go to???   Because of this and the loud back room (steerage, I joked, to my companions) where  they seat the undesirables -- drunken parties, families with children, teen dates, and underdressed folk (which we were because we had just come from the airport on both occasions) I gave only two stars.  I would have given one if not for the awesome salmon (which I ordered rare and they actually obliged!)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pittsburgh-2?start=180,3.24,3.24,3.24,2.7920000000000007,3.2400000000000007

The steak itself had lots of fat on it he had to trim off himself, and the steak overall did not taste great.  This was after waiting about 5 minutes for our server to notice we were not eating because my husbands side dish had not arrived.  When she finally brought it over it was plain french fries! Are you kidding me?!  For $25.00!!!  What a joke.  They looked like frozen, out of a bag fries.  Secondly our service was pretty bad, we asked for straws, they were pretty much thrown at us, and so was the bottle of ketchup.  Wasn't the nice dining experience we were hoping for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pittsburgh-2?start=200,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.8880000000000003,3.1600000000000006

The waiter we had this time around seemed new. He was very friendly, but needed more experience.  My only real complaint is the wait and the reservation guidelines. Basically, you have to reserve before 11am (if you're a large group), or wait in the main area for hours before getting a table after 7PM on a weekend.

I ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich and I figured that since I was going to take a hit between that and a slice of cheesecake, I should get a salad with balsamic vinaigrette as my side. The sandwich came out and it was the greasiest thing I have ever eaten. The bun tasted like it had been deep fried and then soaked in oil overnight - completely unnecessary. To my astonishment, my salad came out with a cream-based balsamic vinaigrette. There's just no reason to put cream in everything.

Fine whatever. Maybe they stashed him behind that particular counter so he wouldn't be tempted to nibble away at the confections. So I deferred to the girl next to him. Apparently she didnt like cheesecake either and had no opinions on the matter. The worker behind her same situation. Thanks for all the help. In the end i made the decision with the help of another patron.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pittsburgh-2?start=100,3.32,3.32,3.32,3.0520000000000005,3.3200000000000003

I was horribly disappointed. Not only was the atmosphere a little different, the food wasn't as good as I had remembered.  I'm willing to pay a pretty penny for a nice meal but this was way overpriced for what they were serving you. The portion sizes at South Side weren't as generous either.  This place is a quintessential American restaurant so don't expect anything ""exotic"" or unique. You can pretty much get their food at a diner for half the cost. There is one redeeming quality for the Cheesecake Factory - the cheesecake. Everything else on the menu you can skip, but if you want to lull yourself in a sugar coma the cheesecake here is your calling.

The menu is HUGE.  The positive is that it offers tons of choices so even the pickiest eater can find something.  The downside is that it can be very difficult to choose unless you are in the mood for something in particular.  This location has a large seating area and also offers outdoor patio seating.  We went on a Thursday evening and were able to be seated right away.   Service was friendly and efficient.  She was attentive but not intrusive.    We tried the Buffalo Bites and the fried macaroni and cheese.  The Buffalo Bites were more than enough for a meal by themselves.  There were a lot of them there.  The flavor is spicy but not over the top.  One of my favorite items on the menu.  We also tried the macaroni and cheese balls.  They were tasty and although it doesn't seem like a lot (especially compared to the number of buffalo blasts) they are filling and worth ordering. Entrees were pasta and the chicken bam bam.  Both portions were HUGE and enough to serve at least two or three people.  The positive on that was leftovers for two additional meals.  Both were flavorful and we would order both of them again.   Not that either of us had the room for it, but we both ordered cheesecake.  I went for the red velvet cheesecake and my husband ordered the cherry cheesecake.  Topped with a generous dash of whipped cream, the size of the pieces was substantial (as they should be for $7 a slice).  They were tasty and stood up well to being eaten several days later as part of our leftovers.

193,Keith H.,"West Des Moines, IA",29,52,,1.0,2013-08-20,"EDIT: I am lowering the score from 2* to 1* because while it's forgivable that the FOH staff spilled something on me and my party's clothing, it isn't okay that they simply don't bother to fix that problem going forward. The manager gave us two business cards after being splashed with buffalo sauce and said that if we mailed the receipts for dry cleaning with those cards it would be reimbursed. We sent in two receipts (my fiance and I) with bills totaling $22 but after 2 months have received nothing back. I have worked as a waiter for years and I get these things happen but it is incumbent on the management staff to resolve these issues and I think the poor job they did trying to fix the situation is indefensible.  Meh! This place is just silly and expensive for the quality.  Quick thing about the restaurant: Why make waiters wear all white? EVERY server's uniform has visible stains. I have waited tables for years so I get how this happens all the time when you are bussing plates so have the waiters wear darker colors (or enforce uniform standards, there is no way all the waiters came in with clean clothes given the universal level of dirtiness). Also, a waiter dropped a thing of buffalo sauce on the floor near us which exploded on both me and one of the people I was with's white shirts, the restaurant offered to pay for dry cleaning, but I kinda think that there should be a comped desert or something as well. The dry cleaning (if effective) is an inconvenience for me which gets me back to where I was before I came in, I think that offering a dessert is something to make up for the inconvenience of making me and my dinner guest have to go to get our clothes dry cleaned. Perhaps I expect too much. About the actual food: it's just not anything worth paying the price for. I had Bang Bang chicken and shrimp, it was labelled as spicy and I asked for it to be extra spicy, there was no spice at all.  My fiance had orange chicken. It was plain and less than one would expect from a basic chinese take-away. The other person we were with ordered meatloaf, it was actually ok but the mashed potatoes were cool by the time it was run to our table. I honestly think that the restaurant just has too many things on that menu to get all of the items right. Positives: the iced tea was good (this matters a lot to me) as were the mojitos the ladies ordered. Two of our deserts were great (I guess this is really why people go here), the tiramisu cheesecake was still thawing when it was brought to us so it was a bit hard in the middle.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pittsburgh-2?start=160,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.9480000000000004,3.3200000000000003

As far as entrées go, I enjoy the Crusted Chicken Romano, the Pasta da Vinci, and the Miso and Herb Crusted Salmon. The Luau and Barbeque Chicken Salads are go to items for me as well. To finish, if I'm not overly stuffed, I love the strawberry shortcake. It's loaded with strawberries and is perfect for sharing.

It's their company policy that there is not wait times, however, this location is the only Cheesecake Factory in Pittsburgh and gets too much attention and they should start doing it. I like to take my 62 year old mother here and she does not want to wait over an hour to get a seat when on medication and with a bad hip. We came here once before a concert to to see the Transiberian Orchestra. They told us the wait would be 45 minutes and we waited 1 hour and 15 minutes and eventually left. The second time was today, after the failed to take my reservation I walk in and the place was packed like sardines. I didn't even bother asking how long of a wait, as it was probably over an hour. My moms birthday dinner was fast food now because this place (as well as it's surrounding restaurants) are all too busy. I don't know what it is about the south side, people just love this area.  I love the food here and that's the reason it's popular. Their chicken marsala is hands down the best dish I've ever had at any restaurant, beating out traditional, family owned restaurants and the works. The cheesecake as well is their mean thing, it's excellent and although severely overpriced they at least give you a huge slice. They've got a huge menu to pick from and their alcohol is also excellent with probably the best margarita's I've ever had.

74,Vi L.,"Philadelphia, PA",195,208,163.0,2.0,2014-09-04,"The cheesecakes are good and the setting is kind of fancy smancy, but that is all. Everything went downhill from that point. The Cheesecake Factory just intensifies my dislike for restaurant chains.   Now, let me whine, cry and complain. It's way too dark in there, how the heck am I supposed to read the menu? Are there sketchy stuff in the food that you guys don't want me to see? Also, it took nearly an hour for my food to arrive. My eating companions literally left the restaurant to walk around and when they came back, I'm still there nibbling on bread and butter. The frustrating part is that the restaurant was not even that busy. I got to try the avocado eggrolls, which were so bland. The Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp dish, which was just a super sweet curry dish. It looks kind of gross, but tastes ok. The Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta was not even spicy at all, but was actually the most edible dish on the table.   Overall, the long wait really turned me off and the food was not that impressive. I recommend this place for the tasty cheesecakes, and ONLY the tasty cheesecakes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pittsburgh-2?start=60,3.6,3.6,3.6,3.0800000000000005,3.6000000000000005

The food is never too die for but you get big portions and the staff is usually very friendly and attentive.  The 5 of us split two apps.. Chicken and mushroom lettuce wraps and avocado egg rolls. Both pretty tasty and it was a good amount to share between us and leave room for dinner.  We all liked our meals too, my aunt was disappointed in the white chicken chili bc they said it wasn't spicy and it was and they also said it came with a side of rice. Well the rice was about a tablespoon on her soup. So that was far from truthful.  Normally I like to try places that aren't chain restaurants, so when I read the menu here, which is almost TOO big, I sometimes get disappointed because it's almost like they try too hard to make different dishes. Hard to explain but I'm sure a lot of you feel the same.  Once again, I didn't leave room for dessert. I do however recommend their red velvet cheesecake from the last time I was there.  I also recommend the Cajun chicken littles and Cajun pasta with chicken asparagus peas and peppers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pittsburgh-2?start=120,3.56,3.56,3.56,3.2120000000000006,3.5600000000000005
80,Meghan S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",8,29,7.0,5.0,2014-09-11,"I love this place. I've been eating here for years, and have been a regular customer this summer. I've tried a variety of dishes: burgers, chicken tenders, buffalo chicken blasts, chicken romano, California cheesesteak... all delicious. The only one I didn't really care for was a pasta dish. I think it was a 3 cheese pasta. The chicken romano is my favorite and I've ordered it my last few visits. All of the dishes are a little pricey (chicken romano $17), but the portions are huge. I always have enough for lunch the next day.  Drinks are delicious as well, and I think the prices are comparable to other restaurants. About $10 per specialty drink (I recommend the Sangria and the Greorgia Peach). I don't drink much beer or wine, so I'm not sure about those. Onto the cheesecake... the Hershey's cheesecake = omg. It's a chocolate lover's dream. I also like the 30th Anniversary cheesecake. And I've tried both of the peanut butter cheesecakes, the Oreo cheesecake, and the turtle cheesecake. All good, but not enough chocolate for me! Cheesecake is about $8 a slice. (Tip: take-out slices are smaller. So order a slice to eat there, and then box it up if you can't finish. Yeahhh maybe I'm greedy, but if I'm spending $8 on a slice, I want my money's worth!) Overall, I spend about $50 each visit. I'd say that service is pretty good here. This goes for all restaurants, people: if it's busy, service might be a little slower. That's the risk you take when you go out on a Saturday night. But I've been here multiple times and I can't say that the service has ever been terrible. I agree with other reviews about the din. It can be hard to converse when it's busy. And they're right that the lighting is dim. But, like the Melting Pot, I think that's all part of the ambience. There is outdoor seating in the summer, and I'm all about outdoor seating. But this summer, there have been bands playing in front of the restaurant, and the music was so loud that we couldn't converse. This is my one and only gripe with this restaurant. I'm guessing that the bands are booked by South Side Works or something and has nothing to do with the Cheesecake Factory. But I wish they'd stop! Other than that, I'm a big fan of this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pittsburgh-2?start=80,3.68,3.68,3.68,3.4760000000000004,3.6800000000000006

We have definitely come here before just to order cheesecake to bring home.  Last night, we were able to sit outside, which was a bonus, but the service was only OK. Our app plate was never cleared throughout dinner and drinks were on the slow side. I had to ask for a second drink because our server never came around and asked. I've had better....I've had worse.  I'm a big fan of the avocado eggroll app, so when we come here that's always a given. I've you've never had it, I really recommend it! It's one of the best things on their menu and the dipping sauce is delicious. I'm hungry just thinking about them! I ordered the grilled fish tacos as my entree and they were pretty bland. There was no real flavorful sauce or even strong citrus flavor. They were fine, but I wouldn't order them again.  Overall, it's a decent place to sit outside for drinks and some cheesecake.

Each table has its own real lit candles.

I do like to cook but when the process becomes a routine I need to take a break and go out some fine restaurant. The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite food-places. I am dying to know the recipe of an appetizer ""Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes"". It is incredibly delicious. Sometimes I just get this dish and cheesecake on the dessert and I`m full.  This place is really busy on weekends. You should be able to wait a twenty or thirty minutes but it is worth it. The waiter stuff is very friendly and they are serving very fast.

110,Alex S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",187,85,172.0,3.0,2015-05-29,"I am not a fan of huge chain restaurants. Taco Bell? Barf. McDonalds? Bleh. Olive Garden? Ick. Panera Bread? I can make this stuff myself. Chipotle? ...Well, I actually like Chipotle, but you get the point. Essentially, what you get at chain restaurants can be hit or miss. The food might be good one day but terrible the next; one establishment might be clean and presentable while another might be deplorable; customer service--if any--might be excellent one night but completely lacking another night. Although I try to keep an open mind, having experienced this myself, I walked into The Cheesecake Factory with fairly modest expectations. I usually do not visit The Cheesecake Factory unless there is a special occasion, such as a once-in-a-year family gathering, a birthday party, or a baby shower. It just so happened that one of my colleagues was having a lunchtime baby shower and this was the venue. So, I drove from Shadyside to Southside, met a little traffic, and parked my car in one of the garages without too much trouble. I walked into the restaurant. As expected, the entrance is very large, expansive, and modernesque, almost like walking into a super high-end shopping mall or a mansion. Ahead was the host/hostess station. I introduced myself and stated that I was there for a baby shower until my colleague's name. They found her name and directed me through the labyrinth of a restaurant all the way to the back and around the corner. Okay! Let's see if I get lost... After I found my group and exchanged pleasantries, I sat down and waited a couple minutes for our waiter. I ordered a mojito and a glass of water for the time being. I received the mojito, which looked and tasted quite good, but he seemed to have misplaced or forgotten my water. I never got a chance to flag him down until he came back who knows how many minutes later to take our food orders. I ordered a pizza and salad combo while my colleagues ordered pasta, steak, salads, and sandwiches. The food took about 20 minutes to arrive, which wasn't too bad considering our group was composed of 10 or so people. I got my water (yay!) and my food. The margherita pizza I ordered was supposedly a personal size pizza and the house salad I got was drizzled with balsamic vinaigrette. Both tasted quite good, but were very large, which was the norm at The Cheesecake Factory. I ate my salad first before moving onto the pizza, of which I managed to eat two slices. During our meal, several of us wanted to get boxes for their leftovers, but our waiter was nowhere to be found. We ended up having to wait until the very end of our meal when our waiter suddenly appeared to ask how our meal was and if we would like some dessert. Some of us ordered dessert while the rest of us requested boxes. The cheesecakes that came out looked divine; alas, I didn't order any because I had eaten and drunk too much. Finally, getting each of our bills didn't take too long. We boxed our food, washed up, and left the restaurant feeling much too stuffed. Overall, the food and drinks were quite good. There was no hair or odd treasures to be found in the food, and no floaty things in our drinks. My only gripe is the outrageous portion sizes, even for lunch! One slice of cheesecake could feed a family of three or four! Only in America... Service lacked somewhat, however. The waiter could have given us a bit more attention in addition to the typical ordering, delivery, and payment collection processes. As I have stated in the beginning, I will not come to The Cheesecake Factory unless there was a special occasion. Supersize portions and flaky customer service are just not for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pittsburgh-2?start=100,3.64,3.46,3.46,3.2440000000000007,3.5320000000000005

31,Lambert P.,"Toronto, Canada",387,1093,4867.0,4.0,2015-08-04,"I've been to this particular Cheesecake Factory maybe 5 or 6 times now.  I love this place regardless that it's a chain because it's one of the higher quality bang for the buck type of restaurants.  This one's a bit different in that it's a standalone building in what seems to be the centerpiece of Southside Works with a mini water fountain type plaza in the front. We came on a Sunday around 3:30pm this time around and there wasn't really a wait at all.  Originally we were just going to have dessert but I'm not really one for sweets so I ended up getting my favorite dish which is the hibachi steak.   The Cheesecake Factory's menu is crazy and has a wide variety of things to choose from but as of late and for as often as we go I always seem to gravitate towards this same dish.  It looked a little different this time around as the steak although still sliced, wasn't scattered and was pretty much left as a whole.  The asparagus were smaller cut spears than previously which seemed to be about 2 or 3 whole spears tempura battered and fried.  The mashed potatoes seemed the same as before but with much more wasabi butter as usual which I did not mind at all.  The steak is sliced, with sprouts and mushrooms in a sugar and soy type of sauce.  Delicious! Overall this is my favorite dish and while I've had many at many Cheesecake Factories all over the continent this is still my fall back menu item and I love it.  Everybody that has ever had a taste of my dish it pretty much became their favorite dish too OR they said it was amazing.   The service at this particular Cheesecake and pretty much all for that matter is always great.  The floor here much like many I've been to before as well seems slippery, greasy or whatever.  I don't know what it is but if you have deck shoes here it could be dangerous!   They pretty much all have the same decor and lighting, the foods basically all the same and so is the service.  Still as good as it gets for medium priced sit down chains and I'm looking forward to when they finally come up to Toronto in the near future.   Wifi would be nice considering people come from all over to eat here and the place is large.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pittsburgh-2?start=20,3.64,3.47,3.47,3.408,3.5380000000000003

We were pleasantly surprised that we were seated in only about 20 minutes, but it was only down hill from there.  We ordered the grilled artichoke as an appetizer (which probably wasn't the strongest choice considering the other options), but it was inedible. I'm not a picky eater and I've never sent any dish back at a restaurant, so we didn't make a fuss, but we physically could not chew it.  When our waiter saw that we had hardly touched it and asked how it was, we just laughed and said it was inedible, but all he said was, ""hopefully your entrees are better.""  My boyfriend ordered the spicy cashew chicken and I ordered the chicken piccata.  My chicken was okay.  It didn't have a whole lot of flavor, and it only had 3 little capers on it (which is my favorite part!), but the spicy cashew chicken was really bad.  The rice was actually floating in the amount of sauce that the chicken was drenched in.  My boyfriend could hardly eat any of it.  To make things worse, we never once had our waters filled during the entire meal even though my boyfriend's water was empty after only about 20 minutes.  In addition, our waiter was very difficult to track down to get our checks, and then it was a good while once again before he took our payment.   The only redeeming aspect of our meal was the dessert.  We ordered the red velvet cheesecake (in which we waited quite some time to order it and then have it brought to our table), but it was delicious!

It's my personal belief that if your menu needs page numbers, you have too many things on the menu, but what do I know? The thing about CF is you have to remember their thing is cheesecake and they do that well. It's hard for me to say they do it any better than that, because really, I don't like cake, even ones made of cheese. As for the food, they have a ton of options and they are consistent. If you find something there you love, more than likely you will love it every time.  Like I usually get a pizza or this chicken BBQ salad which rocks! But is HUGE!  Because we had stopped by before going to the movies, we were eating rather light. Two of us got the pizza and salad lunch for about $13.00, which was really reasonable considering the pizza is a decent size, AND you get to choose from any pizza toppings you want; I chose the chicken BBQ. Mmmmmm! The salad was literally just greens and a couple tomato quarters...not as Mmmmmmm. The BF got the lunch size meatloaf, which was not really to his/our liking. It comes smothered in gravy and onions, and I am an anti-onion person. Everyone got desert- cheesecake, of course- and the best by far was the salted caramel. Coming in a close second was the raspberry lemon, which was very refreshing and, because it has a cake layer (or something, I can't really remember) it is one of the least bad for you, calorically speaking. The Hershey's chocolate was a dud. Just really chocolatey without any charm or pizazz.  My parting advice would be to check out the menu on line BEFORE going, to narrow down you options, so you don't go into menu shock when you get there (seriously, it's like 14 pages).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pittsburgh-2?start=80,3.6,3.51,3.51,3.628,3.5460000000000003

I like privately owned, farm to table, tapas as much as the next food snob, but I like The Cheesecake Factory. And a lot of other (maybe not food snobs) do too. How do I know this? Try getting a table anytime and see how long the wait is. Try getting a table on a Friday/Saturday or even a seat at the bar OR even a seat in their waiting area and it'll take an hour (at least). So that's annoying, but you can also make reservations or do take out. And it's not like you weren't warned.  Anyway, I like the food. I've enjoyed most of the appetizers and entrees I've had. I've also had maybe 20 Oreo cheesecake slices in the last three years so hopefully that tells you something about the (Oreo) cheesecake. Occasionally someone I'm with doesn't like their food, but that's not typically what happens. Besides the wait, the service occasionally leaves something to be desired. My last interaction was over the phone for take out and it was pretty good, except this awkward moment where I said ""can I have the Americana burger sub a veggie patty?"" And the lady on the other end goes ""do you just want the veggie burger?"" And in my head I was an a**hole and responded with 'No, that's why I asked for the Americana burger.' Externally, I realized she thought I might have missed the veggie option on the menu (or maybe they try to discourage substitutions) and responded with a proper ""No thanks, I would like the Americana burger with a veggie patty."" And, if anyone is wondering- I've had the Americana burger with a veggie patty maybe four times now and have been satisfied with my choice of entree and restaurant each time.  The well drinks are also good, but keep in mind if you order a specialty cocktail it will have at least half the amount of alcohol you expect for twice the price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pittsburgh-2?start=20,3.68,3.58,3.58,3.728,3.6200000000000006

I like how there are many shops around it just incase you need to kill time and it is very convenient for the movie theater to be right across the street.  They have a big selection of food, desserts and drinks. And the portions are big so you get your money's worth. The only downside is that this location gets really crowded because a lot of people from the Southside, downtown and neighboring areas flock to this location.

77,Jessica S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",163,9,,1.0,2016-04-05,"Let me start by saying I am usually a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory. Despite the super crowded tables, I enjoy the food and the atmosphere. The service is never great, but that is something I have come to terms with. However, the Cheesecake Factory on the South Side had particularly TERRIBLE service when I went this weekend on Sunday night.  It wasn't terribly busy, and we were seated right away (party of two). After being seated, we were not approached for an entire ten minutes. We were beginning to think they forgot about us, but were glad when the waitress came. She took our drink orders (just water) and we asked for bread, and then we didn't see her for another ten minutes at least. When she came back, she brought two waters but no bread, claiming that there wasn't any ready despite all of the tables around us receiving bread continuously from their respective waiters/waitresses. She refused to take our orders when she dropped the drinks off, so we had to wait. She came back around five-ten minutes later, and without bread again. She finally took our orders. About ten minutes after that, she came back and asked what we ordered again, because she ""was confused"" and got things mixed up. At this time, we decided to ask another waitress for bread, who brought it out within two minutes. A little bit later, our waitress came back, still claimed no bread had been made (despite us having received some, but not from her), and asked us if we had seen a credit card or any receipts lying around or under our table. She insisted we look under our table. Apparently she had lost the credit card and receipt of one of the tables she was waiting on. When the food came out, it was perfect and we were very pleased with that. Throughout the entire meal, she did not refill out waters once, she brought us no bread, and when I asked her to box my food, she never brought it back. Overall she was the worst waitress I have ever had and I cannot believe that the Cheesecake Factory has her working there. She is a disgrace to the restaurant. I will probably not return because I am so infuriated with how we were treated. We asked to speak to a manager and were told that there was not a manager present. I will likely try calling to inform them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pittsburgh-2?start=60,3.76,3.63,3.63,3.14,3.682

Plus, remember to have your parking slip validated by the front desk (always nice when you can't find on-street parking).

30,Kimberly T.,"Downtown, Pittsburgh, PA",735,645,2146.0,4.0,2016-04-18,So many people like to eat at the Cheesecake Factory that there is always a wait. I don't mind waiting for good food. They have an extensive menu. It's probably the biggest menu I have ever seen. I believe instead of a huge menu of mediocre food that it would be better to have a smaller menu of really good food. So the last two times I have gone to The Cheesecake Factory I went in and got cheesecake to go. I tried the Cookie Dough flavor and they aren't kidding-there was a lot of cookie dough. In fact there was very little cheesecake compared to cookie dough. It was clunky and I wasn't a huge fan. The second trip I got Key Lime cheesecake. It is amazing. It's definitely one of my top 2 favorites. It is tangy and has a little bit of zing to it. It is refreshing during the warmer weather. There is a huge list of flavored to try. I can't wait to try other flavors.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pittsburgh-2?start=20,3.72,3.63,3.63,3.568,3.6660000000000004

My personal top orders are the Grande Burrito and Luau Salad. For appetizer, the Factory Nachos are the way to go. Warm, crunchy nachos with pulled chicken, salsa, sour cream, cheese, jalapenos, beans, guac and probably more. And of course their cheesecakes are very good - never had a bad one. Getting a table there can be a long affair if you go during peak times so go during off hours if you can. The level of service is also directly correlated to how busy they are in my experience.

I took myself to the Southside location recently after a long day of shopping and was sat right away. Restaurant is always clean, comfortable, has friendly staff members, and DELICIOUS!  I can only imagine how lame it sounds to say that the free bread appetizer is my favorite part every time I come in, but really it is. I always look forward to it. I ordered the tomato basil pasta dish and it was phenomenal, just heated up the leftovers tonight for dinner and it tasted just as good. Of course, I also enjoyed some cheesecake for dessert (strawberry this time around), and I swear they have the best cheesecake on this earth. I have never been let down by the Cheesecake Factory and I know I'll be back many times in my life.

You are also served a bread basket while you wait to munch on appetizers.

49,C C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",8,225,281.0,3.0,2016-07-31,"The National Cheesecake Day deal was just too good to miss. I, being the sugar-addicted dessert aficionado that I am, had to visit not just once, but twice. If I lived closer I probably would have gone for all four meals during the two-day promotion. Overall, the service was timely, professional, and attentive. The decor, atmosphere, and layout are that of a typical Cheesecake Factory: could be great for a date, but no one cares if you show up in a t-shirt and jeans. The quality of the food is great, but the prices are a little high for it to be more than the occasional treat (especially for a college student). The menu is very large, which can be a little overwhelming. I stopped by on Friday afternoon around 2:30 pm with a friend. We were seated at a table outside within a few minutes. The complimentary bread was yummy; I prefer the honey wheat brown bread to the sourdough because it is softer. I ordered the roasted pear and blue cheese flatbread, and my friend got the avocado, zucchini, and portabella fries, which were served with two dips. These were considered ""small plates and snacks"" on the menu and cost $6.50 each. Without cheesecake, the portion sizes would not have filled me up. (But I guess that's the point, I've never gone to the Cheesecake Factory and not gotten cheesecake). I enjoyed my flatbread--it had a great, crunchy crust. The amount of toppings was perfect, although the flavor profile isn't one that I particularly cared for (just my tastebuds, though). My friend enjoyed her ""fries"" as well, especially the zucchini ones.  Then, of course, we ordered cheesecake. We split the new Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch and Adam's Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple. The Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch had a great, strong hazelnut flavor; however, I found myself missing the bitterness of the chocolate to balance out the sweetness. Adam's Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple was even sweeter, being loaded with candy bars and caramel. The plain cheesecake at the edge that didn't get the caramel swirl or candy bits was a relief. I returned again on Saturday around 1 pm by myself. This time, I ordered the Tomato Mozzarella Toast, which was much more in line with my tastes. The crunchy bread was perfect, the tomatoes were sweet and juicy, and the pesto burst with flavor. Really delicious, if a little overpriced at $8.50. After my sweetness overload from the previous day, I decided to go with the Tiramisu Cheesecake. The coffee provided the bitterness I was looking for; this one was not too sweet for my tastes. However, the cheesecake itself could have been richer. So, bottom line: pretty good. If I'm going to be picky, food is pricey. Cheesecake flavors are cool, but I prefer richer cheesecakes that are more tangy than sweet. But they're good to satisfy my need for sugar. If it wasn't for the promotion, I wouldn't have visited, and I doubt I will soon if not for a special occasion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pittsburgh-2?start=40,4.08,3.69,3.69,3.0200000000000005,3.846

It was pleasant for the palate, not too heavy or too sweet. I asked for extra whipped cream. It was great to have extra whipped cream because the cream was not sweet.

I commend the Cheesecake Factory for being so open, welcoming, and accommodating to us. I could not even remember the last time that I came here. I believe it was about 2 or 3 years ago because we came after my friend picked out a wedding dress to celebrate. I am really surprised after this last visit that we don't come more often. Granted, the South Side area that it is in sometimes the parking can be annoying, so maybe that is it? I look forward to coming back here though! We all looked over the menu before we got there. With this place the menu is about the size of a novel so you have to at least glance at it to get oriented to what you might want to eat.  Appetizers: EGGROLL SAMPLER: A Variety of All of Our Eggrolls with Avocado, Tex Mex, Crispy Cuban and Firecracker Salmon.: YUM. I got to try the firecracker salmon and the avocado. The avocado was amazing. Seriously, and that dipping sauce, totally on point. This was a nice sampler and each of the eggrolls were cut into two so we got to try more than one of the rolls. I liked the sauces as much as I liked the eggrolls! GUACAMOLE MADE-TO-ORDER:Ripe Avocado, Onion, Tomato, Chiles, Cilantro and Fresh Lime. Served with Tortilla Chips, Salsa and Sour Cream.: Wowza, this guacamole was hot! The jalapenos in the guacamole were spicy! I mean, I liked it but dang it had some fire. I liked that the plate came with a lot of chips. I hate it when you get guacamole or even salsa and you have to keep on asking for more chips in order for the table to finish the dish, small annoyance but still.  Entree: CHICKEN BELLAGIO:Crispy Coated Chicken Breast over Basil Pasta and Parmesan Cream Sauce Topped with Prosciutto and Arugula Salad: OMG.YES.YES.YES. I wanted to go with another chicken dish but the waitress described it as, ""eh"" and the Chicken Bellagio, my second choice, she described as, ""favorite thing on the menu"". I had to then of course pick the Chicken Bellagio. I am so happy I did. First, the dinner portion was huge. The chicken came in two pounded out thin breasts so I just put one and half the pasta into a box right away so I wouldn't be tempted to eat it. This dish was banging. Seriously. The Parmesan cream sauce was delish and the basil pasta was not overwhelming at all. It was a very subtle flavor. The chicken was pounded thin and was a crisp perfection. I loved the salad that topped the dish. It added some live green to the dish that complemented everything really well. YUM. The only thing is, the prosciutto was in strips. I wish that it was cut up maybe just a little. It was hard to cut through, as prosciutto usually is so smaller pieces might have made the dish a bit easier to eat. I did not eat any dessert because after the fresh bread at the table, the apps, and the dinner, I could not fit another thing into my belly.  I know that I am usually not the biggest fan of chain restaurants but  this was a great experience and the food was AWESOME.

Their wine by the glass list is laughable, but their full bar makes up for it. My favorite thing to eat is the Ahi Tuna Carpaccio (very sushi-like) and, of course, the cheesecake. Service is always really good (we typically sit at the bar) and fast and any special requests are respected without question (e.g. sauce on the side) or complaint. Despite being a massive restaurant, it is usually packed to the gills with diners, but they turn tables quickly enough that as long as you don't have a large party, wait times are kept to minimum. They will also validate your parking (2 hours) for any of the Southside Works garages.

The crust is made with coconut macaroons, then there is the mango cheesecake, and on top is a smooth mango mousse. The cheesecake is a light and refreshing way to end the meal.

41,Rissa D.,"Pittsburgh, PA",29,65,88.0,3.0,2017-01-30,"I'm actually really disappointed with my recent visit to the Cheesecake Factory. I think that three stars is rather generous for the sloppy salad and slow service during the lunch hour. I ordered a French Country Salad with crasins instead of beets, while my lunch buddy decided to get the Caesar salad. After we placed our order, the server brought out bread; however, there was only one type of bread in the basket to our disappointment, but oh well no biggie at this point. We didn't see it sever until our food was brought out, which seemed to take quite awhile, but again, no big deal at this point. However, as soon as I went to dig into my salad I noticed that the bits of asparagus, nuts, and goat cheese were all under my lettuce mix. This was strange. I asked the server where my crasins were she said oh sorry I had the cook make you a new salad since we put them directly on the salad (I asked for them on the side because I wasn't sure what I was going to get, crasins or actual cranberries). So, I doubt I got a new salad and just had the crasins taken out, which was why all of my toppings were under the salad. Again, this wasn't a big deal until I noticed that I had a lot of wilted and mushy lettuce in my salad. I was really really disappointed because that's just plain gross. I had the blackish pieces that get all slimy and stick to the other leaves.

Literally the most frustrating thing about the Factory- even after you decide you immediately wonder if you should have scanned the menu one more time!  We started off with the crab/artichoke dip with soft baguette slices. It was good, but nowhere near the best crab dip we have had. To their credit it did have a very generous amount of crab! I always have to have a side salad with my dinner; it's just mandatory for me! I decided on the tossed salad, though I really wanted the Greek salad. For only 6.95, this salad was huge! A bit more than your typical side salad but that's because it's way bigger. Although I would give it 5/5, it was unfortunate that I just couldn't eat it all because I still needed to eat my meal! I got the Pasta Da Vinci for my entree; I love mushrooms and was excited to see a variety of different types of mushrooms in a pasta dish. The mushrooms were incredible, and the grilled chicken was cooked very well, but the sauce was very bland. It was okay, but nothing spectacular. My SO enjoyed his dinner; he said the shrimp scampi was one of the best things he's ever eaten! The mashed potatoes were okay, but not very creamy, more lumpy and a bit dry.

Each occasion we went, we purposely arrived between lunch and dinner when it wasn't crowded.We still waited for over 25 minutes for our meals (we ordered salads) .When we asked for extra dressing, another 10 minutes passed...Like I said, it was not crowded so I don't understand the wait. The second time we went, the same thing happened, but it took even longer to get our meals. Our waiter seemed distracted and rushed even though he was waiting on only 3 tables. We waited over 20 minutes for him to bring us the check. Ridiculous. Food okay and over-priced. Good service should be a priority. Also, music is too loud.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pittsburgh-2?start=60,3.44,3.67,3.67,,3.5780000000000003
6,Michael E.,"Pittsburgh, PA",115,56,58.0,4.0,2017-07-07,"For sophistication's sake, I want to give The Cheesecake Factory 3 stars, but let's be honest . . . I love this restaurant.  This location is great because when waiting 3+ hrs you can walk around REI or stare at shooting water in the southside works while you wait. There's a lot of great shops to meander around while trying to kill time. A con, however, is they still use the taser-looking bricks instead of texting you. (You guys should fix that.)  Inside decor. Lavish. Unique. Kind of gaudy. But I like it. Honestly, you look up and wonder if you're in the Sistine Chapel. Brilliant. Who paints that? And more importantly, you cannot help but wonder if your booth is housing a dinosaur egg or if youre eating under the menacing eye of Saruman (if you have no clue what I'm taking about, you cannot unsee it when you do.)  Both options are exciting.  A part of me truly judges the person who says they don't like The Cheesecake Factory. Why? Saying you don't like The Cheesecake Factory is like saying you don't like food - because the menu covers every discipline of food making. Honestly, the thing is an encyclopedia. If you are indecisive, you need to look at the menu and have a game plan before entering. Otherwise, you will be there all night just trying to decide. If you don't know what to get, I suggest one of two options (and really both if you're me).  1. Order the Crusted Chicken Romano. It may not be the most adventurous option, but I am willing to say it is the best. Delicious. Massive. Caloric.  2. Just keep eating the refillable bread baskets. They serve a wheat that is to die for. *Lifehack: when the bowl of butter comes out, grab two of those packets and place one behind each knee - otherwise you might as well try to spread a hardened slab of concrete on your bread.  If you can eat all your food, you may want to (scratch that), always order Cheesecake. They're all good and there are about 7,000 options. I love the raspberry white chocolate, and I usually order it to go.  Southside parking on the street is free at random times, so make sure you check the meters. If you don't mind walking a couple blocks, Sarah St. will save you from paying for parking if you are crazy about that like I am. If you're not, they have multiple parking garages in the area AND a valet (they used to even validate parking garage tickets, so look into that!).  Cheesecake Factory... quantity, quantity, good quality, and always an experience. Check. It. Out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pittsburgh-2,3.48,3.67,3.67,,3.5940000000000003
2,Taylor K.,"Pittsburgh, PA",76,87,145.0,4.0,2017-07-13,"I am always so satisfied with my experiences at The Cheesecake Factory. This location in South Side is the same way. Great happy hour deals - a number of apps are $6 (happy hour is only in the bar area). We tried the Buffalo chicken bombs on my most recent trip this week and they were SO YUM - fried and served with blue cheese.  My only complaint in this area is the parking is a headache. Cheesecake Factory doesn't have a lot. Plenty of garages around, but just not ideal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pittsburgh-2,3.44,3.67,3.67,,3.5780000000000003

Waited almost 50 minutes for food.... because waitress forgot to turn in our order......when my chicken salad finally arrived....wait for it... wait for it....it had NO chicken.

53,Jack M.,"McKeesport, PA",9,7,,2.0,2017-08-16,"I went here for my birthday with my family a little while back and I can tell you I was pretty dissapointed. The decor and vibe of the whole place was very sophisticated and pleasing to look at. We waited probably about 45 minutes just for our appetizers to come, and I got the fried mac and cheese bites. They were pretty good, but they were burnt. The bread they served was pretty stale. It felt like an eternity waiting for our main dish. My sister's boyfriend got the wrong meal several times, and my meal (which I believe was a penne four cheese pasta with chicken) was salty, the sauce was horrible and the chicken was pretty soggy. My brother got a burger that was meant to be medium rare and he got well done, as well. The staff treated us like little children. The cheesecake was pretty okay, but it was pretty much the same thing you could get from the grocery store. We got our bill reduced due to mistakes, and it somehow still came out to be about $300. Overall, very mediocre for such a high price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pittsburgh-2?start=40,3.52,3.63,3.63,,3.5860000000000003

4,Tori L.,"Covington, KY",138,30,39.0,4.0,2017-10-13,"As common as the Cheesecake Factory is.. I mean every outdoor mall or shopping ""town center""... but anyway, I try to avoid mega-chains like this, but honestly, it's super good. Get past the fake Italian rustic wallpaper and you've got page after page of menu items to choose from. Their salads are unique and packed with stuff - my mom, sister and I went out to lunch together and each got a different salad, all three satisfying. Cheesecake aside, they actually do a good job with their restaurant food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pittsburgh-2,3.52,3.65,3.65,,3.5980000000000003
1,Valerie V.,"Boston, PA",35,97,325.0,5.0,2017-10-22,If I had to sum up my many experiences at this Cheesecake Factory in only a few words I would say they consistently exceed my expectations and delivering excellent meals and service with a large menu. I have never ordered anything that I didn't completely enjoy and the portions are enormous. The chicken buffalo pastry app is fantastic as is the southwest egg roll.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pittsburgh-2,3.52,3.65,3.65,,3.5980000000000003
0,Kashiff M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",107,28,48.0,5.0,2017-11-05,Cheesecake Factory is da bomb!! The ambiance when I walked in was inviting and the hostess welcomed us to sit anywhere in the bar area. We figured it'd be a lengthy wait on a Sunday during brunch but we were pleased to sit down at a high top right away. Our server John was excellent! He kept our glasses full and bread on the table.  I ordered the Breakfast Burrito that stuffed me half way through. My date ordered the Farm Fresh Eggs with potatoes and bacon on a plate the size of Texas. Everything was amazing and we offered cheesecake to go of course.  I can't wait to go back next Sunday for brunch with more friends!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pittsburgh-2,3.52,3.66,3.66,,3.6040000000000005
38,Laila Z.,"Alexandria, VA",0,9,,1.0,2017-11-22,"I have been to The Cheesecake Factory locations all over the country, but I have to say the manager, Jason, was the most unprofessional manager I have ever come across. I ordered over $100 worth of take out. Once I got the food home, I noticed that the avocados were missing from both of the chicken and avocado salads. I called the restaurant and spoke to Jason. To start, Jason voiced that they only add 2 ounces of avocados to a a salad that has avocados listed in the name.  He was rude and did not offer an apology for the error.  Jason then asked me to come back all the way from home to pick up my 2 ounces of avocados for each salad.  After I told him I was too far to return, he stated he would send me a gift card worth $20 for what he stated was for two slices of free cheesecake. He did not even care that I paid $15 for each salad and spent over $100 overall. He disregarded my cost and said he was only sending the card for the missing avocados. I told Jason his disregard was unprofessional and that I would write to corporate. He said to go ahead and started playing with the telephones buttons, pretending he was having phone issues, and hung up. Jason is not management material. Needless to say, I will not go back to this location as long as the restaurant is managed by a person who is clearly not cut out for management.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pittsburgh-2?start=20,3.52,3.64,3.64,,3.5920000000000005
