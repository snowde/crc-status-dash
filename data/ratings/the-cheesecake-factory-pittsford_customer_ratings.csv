98,Kristen O.,"Trenton, NJ",76,193,30.0,2.0,2012-01-27,"This place is OK but not really anything to rave about. The food is always just so-so but really the only reason worth the visit is the cheesecake.  I went with a large group of people and I ordered the asian lettuce wraps. On the menu it only came with chicken but since I don't eat chicken I asked for them to make it in shrimp. The waitress had no idea how much extra it would cost for them to add in the shrimp (I think they ended up adding 3 or 4 dollars on for 6 pieces of shrimp-rip off) but I ordered it anyway. There was still pieces of the shell on the shrimp which was really unappetizing and made the texture really weird. Yuck. The dipping sauces were clearly straight from a container or bottle and tasted so-so. When it came time to order the cheesecake, they woudn't even let us eat it in the restaurant, they brought it out in to-go boxes because I guess we were too close to closing time to eat it there? There was plenty of time to eat it before they closed but oh well. I ended up eating the Oreo cheesecake the next day and it was pretty good but nothing special. Probably won't go back to this place. Overpriced ($20-$25 for a soft beverage, small dinner, and dessert) and not even that good tasting of food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pittsford?start=80,2.8240000000000003,2.8240000000000003,2.8240000000000003,2.8240000000000003,2.8240000000000003

151,Rob C.,"Greene, NY",2,19,1.0,4.0,2012-05-27,"We arrived for dinner and it was relatively busy. We were seated quickly however and our waitress was very friendly. We had avocado eggrolls as an appetizer because it sounded different. It ended up being quite delicious. I had the Hibachi Steak which also came with shiitake mushrooms, onions, bean sprouts, wasabi mashed potatoes and tempura asparagus. I'm not a potato fan so I can't speak to how that was. The steak and other sides were very tasty. I'm a sucker for tempura vegetables and they did not let down. The steak and other vegetables were delicious as well. I'm a big cheesecake fan and decided to try the mango key lime cheesecake for dessert. I was sadly a little disappointed as it wasn't as good as I expected but it could have just been the flavor combination that didn't work for me. All in all our food was very good, we had good service, and the price wasn't too terrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pittsford?start=140,3.056,3.056,3.056,3.056,3.0560000000000005

64,Ben W.,"New York, NY",449,757,434.0,3.0,2013-01-05,"Food makes the experience for me. Unfortunately, Cheesecake did not make the cut. From what my parents tell me, this place is always bustling and there's always a wait. Luckily, we were able to get a table right when we walked in on an early Friday afternoon. Out server Jackie was very friendly and immediately brought a basket of bread and took down our drink orders (even though we're just a water and lemon family). With our cold waters and piping-hot bread and butter in hand, we decided to tackle our next order of business: the menu. Now, I have seen lots of menus in my lifetime. However, I think this place tops the list as far as how many items it has. Spiral-bound and about 16 pages longs, there's plenty of choices for almost any palate. While this is a huge plus for large groups, this completely overwhelmed me. Sadly Yelp didn't have too many food suggestions and I was faced with making a decision between 20 different types of chicken and 15 types of burgers, just to name a few. I decided to go with the Grilled Shrimp and Bacon Club with Sweet Potato Fries. The rest of the family ordered the Cajun Blackened Shrimp, the Navajo with fries, and the Mushroom Burger with salad greens. Unfortunately, there was quite a long wait time for our dishes, closing in on about 25 minutes before they came out. I think it was because of the timing of cooking the dishes, because three out of four of our plates (the physical plates) were scalding hot, as if they had been sitting on a hot plate for a while. Presentation wise, I liked how the dishes were arranged. The two sandwiches had their fries in a nice silvery steel cup. The shrimp dish had everything in their own neat piles and it was very visually appealing. The burger even looked especially nice, with grilled mushrooms and cheese oozing off the sides. Unfortunately, my club sandwich was wayyyy too oily. All three slices of bread were soaked through with butter and the special dressing in combination led to an omg-I-can't-finish-the-second-half-because-it's-just-oily/rich situation.  The shrimp was also slightly overcooked and tough to eat through. I ended up taking apart the second half of the sandwich and just eating the shrimp and potatoes. The sweet potatoe fries were also disappointing. While my plate burning hot, the fries were barely warm. Also, the majority of them were over-fried, so it seemed more like thin sweet potato chips than fries. Overall, not impressed. The other dishes were hit-and-miss. The burger was probably my favorite. My mom asked for medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. The bun and toppings with it led to a decent burger. However, the salad had too much dressing and the greens were soggy. I didn't try the Navajo, but the fries were very good. Crispy but still meaty on the insides. And hot. The shrimp was not to my liking, but my brother was enjoying it. It was just too sweet for me. Also, the rice was a little dry. However, the mango salsa helped me with cutting through the oil of my sandwich. My brother and I split a Chocolate Raspberry Truffle slice of cheesecake. While the namesake, neither of us were too impressed. The biggest complaint was the chocolate ganache on top: not only was it rock hard, but it tasted like chocolate buttercream frosting more so than ganache. Tip: don't try and eat a whole slice by yourself: it's very dense and enough for two. I found the interior to be a little tacky, but the buzz and environment was pretty good. They have a small barrier between the bar and restaurant areas, but the buzz still carried through the air and you could just feel the energy of the place. Also, the service was spot on. Our server was very attentive, knowledgeable, and willing to hold a small conversation. My dad also noted that on his way to and from the bathroom, every single server he passed smiled at him. A+ on that on, Cheesecake Factory! Overall, I had a poor experience because my food wasn't great. However, if you don't mind paying more for mediocre food in exchange for great service and a lively environment, this is the place for you. Pros: menu variety, attentive/friendly service, environment, menu variety (needed to be said twice) Cons: food too oily/not too exciting, speediness of food delivery Dishes to try: Mushroom Burger Dishes to skip: Grilled Shrimp and Bacon Club, Sweet Potato Fries",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pittsford?start=60,2.8920000000000003,2.8920000000000003,2.8920000000000003,2.8920000000000003,2.892000000000001

Had no trouble finishing the dish even after a fair bit of bread (warm, soft, good, and no shortage of butter-- nice change).  Service was attentive and friendly but not hovering (hate that).

After the wait to get seated, I generally always have fantastic service.  The waiters are very prompt and always check back on the customers.  The menu is very overwhelming.  They offer a ton of food choices which is great, but sometimes annoying- How can I pick what I want for dinner when I have 100 different choices?  Everything that I try is always good but I generally stick to pasta dishes.   I am not a cheesecake fan but the rest of my family is.  They are all in love with the cheesecakes and I have tried some of their milkshakes and cakes and they are all good as well. The restaurant itself is really dark making it difficult to see and loud.  They pack it with so many people it can't help but become loud.  I have had a few problems with that and having children with me.  I say it is not good for children because of the long wait times, darkness, loudness and because the staff never seems to take much care in them.  they do not ask if you need a high chair or booster seat and they generally don't even want to give you a children's menu.  There are going to be kids there so treat them like you would any other customer. I have also used their take out option as well.  This is my favorite.  You call and they tell you 15 minutes no matter what.  You get there and they will bring it out to your car or you can go inside to pay and pick up.  Either way, it is generally fast.  This is my favorite option because you don't have to wait to be seated, I don't have to rely on a waiter for everything, and I don't have to pay a tip which makes it a bit cheaper.

One of my only beefs about the restaurant is that the regular menu items are immense! Big enough for sharing with one (or two) people.

Tables turn over often and there's a constant buzz of noise that I found myself sitting in a hunchback of Cheesecake Factory position to hear my conversation. The tables for pairs are spaced out just enough for the next table's skinny waiter to squeeze in between and we often got the arse end of his service. Our waiter and hostess were friendly and fast. We started with Cuban rolls which tasted like egg rolls stuffed with corn beef. They were crispy but a little salty. I wasn't a fan of the side sauce when I did a taste test but it offsets the saltiness of the roll together....or maybe my tastebuds became immune to the salt. I ordered the tuna tataki salad entree which was lettuce, tomato, tuna, and ginger all placed separately on the dish. The tuna was seared and encrusted with black pepper. The sauce on the side gave the tuna a little zing of flavor. I think the salad is overpriced at $17 for 5 pieces of tuna. For dessert, we ordered the red velvet cheesecake and the lemoncello cake. The red velvet cake was dry and not enough cheese. Instead, it was a topped with a dense layer of what seemed like crisco as the frosting. It looked like fondant in form but the texture was like crisco. Ew. On the other hand, the lemoncello cake was light and moist with a nice hint of lemon. Dessert portions were huge so it justifies the cost but make sure you pick a good one. Overall, it is a good place to go if you want options because their menu is 20+ pages.  I'm biased and prefer mom and pop restaurants versus chains so I probably won't be back unless a friend picks this place again.

I've ordered several dishes from here and most have been OK. However, recently, I ordered the Moroccan Chicken and it was disgusting. Except for the raisins which came with it, it was quite flavorless. The dish is supposed to come with harissa sauce (which is a spicy chili-based sauce), but instead comes with a thick, creamy and tasteless red-colored sauce. On top of that, the chicken was incredibly buttery and the Israeli couscous was a bit undercooked (I would have expected regular couscous for a Moroccan dish, not Israeli couscous). Basically, this dish was tasteless and had no passing resemblance to real Moroccan food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pittsford?start=120,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.6640000000000006,3.2800000000000002

I came here for an early solo celebration for my birthday and to recover from some serious retail therapy. I ordered the combination plate with Steak Diane and the famous chicken dish which were both really good. Everyone knows that the CF is known for giving you a ton of food, but this plate was well balanced.  Another know thing is how warm and soft the bread is. I, for one, love the ""brown bread"". It is some type of wheat bread with crack oats... it's addicting. I was told to wait as they were waiting for a new batch to come from the oven. That was a lie, the batch my waitress brought me was stale and crusty, which is not typical of CF bread. When I asked for a new batch, she brought me bread that felt the same way, which I did not like. I am assuming that they had some old bread they were trying to get rid of or the bakers didn't know what s/he was doing.  I ordered the same cheesecake I always do, the plain with fresh strawberries. They never cease to disappoint.

67,Patricia C.,"Azusa, CA",61,141,51.0,1.0,2014-04-11,"We came a couple of months back for a birthday brunch. This was probably the worst Cheesecake Factory experience I've ever had. Mind you, I've gone to a handful of Cheesecake Factories (all over California and then some) and this was, by far, the worst customer experience ever. We were seated for brunch almost immediately. The hostess led us past all of the empty table to the back of the room. We did not mind until 30 minutes later, not one waiter came by to take our order or to introduce their self to us. I had to get out of my seat and stand in the aisle before I caught a server and asked to be moved to a different table. She gave me a look and said she would need to talk to the hostess. After many conversations between the hostess, server, and our actual server, we were finally moved to a table closer to the middle of the restaurant (where everyone else was sitting). But of course, this was not after having unnecessary and rude comments thrown at us. We could also clearly see the employees bad-mouthing us a few tables down simply because we asked to be seated at a table where it would be easier to get attention. Our new waitress introduced herself to us with a sour face. We politely ordered food and drinks and she went on her way. Our waitress switched off with another and went on a break. Our new and third waitress originally also portrayed a flat affect. However, over the course of our meal we were able to win her over. She was sweet and helpful with everything we asked for. The food itself was good. Not mind-blowing but you can never really go wrong with Cheesecake Factory food. However, I prefer the dinner foods here more. There was absolutely no reason for the employees there to treat us the way we did. We only asked to change tables and when we did, we did so with a ""please"" and ""thank you"". Not once did we give attitude despite the numerous glares, sour faces, and snide comments. And honestly, it's not like Cheesecake Factory is top-tier and has the right to be snobby like they were. I only say this because I've worked in the food industry - it's your job to provide excellent customer service, even if you're having a crappy morning for one reason or another.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pittsford?start=60,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.5960000000000005,3.2000000000000006
71,Joley B.,"Rochester, NY",17,412,416.0,3.0,2014-04-12,"I had a terrible experience here years ago when it first opened.  I hated my dish - it was terrible.   Something about it wasn't right, there was no effort to make something different, and it was my birthday dinner so I was really annoyed.  I think I may have cried afterwards because everyone ate and loved their food, and I was hungry. Needless to say - I hadn't been back until a few weeks ago when a friend suggested it for lunch prior to catching a movie at the Pittsford Theater. I managed to get a decent parking space - but it was INSANE.  I sat in my car for a few minutes waiting for my friend and there were at least 5 cars that stopped, put their turn signal on, and wait for my spot.  I waved two away, ignored two, and then got out when the 5th figured they too had scored a decent space. I can't believe how busy this place is even at 2:30 in the afternoon. We were crammed into a two person table near a sidewall, and the poor gentlemen were forced to listen to girls only conversation.  Sorry! For my meal I started with a cup of soup - baked potato.  It's a meal in and of itself.  I  really only ate that and a piece of baguette.  I had also ordered the Kale and Quinoa salad.  The salad was delicious to be honest, and I was quite pleased with it.  I didn't eat much until lunch the next day, because I wasn't going to take soup home, and I was too full anyways. The Kale and Quinoa was excellent.  Honestly, I hadn't enjoyed kale in quite some time, and this was delicious.  Light and fresh, there was just enough quinoa to balance with the kale, and the sunflower seeds were a great addition.  I was inspired by this dish to recreate the salad at home, and I'm quite grateful for that - for it is much cheaper and just as tasty. I am inclined to come back again if someone else suggests it as a place they'd like to go.  With such a big menu, its good to know I like something on it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pittsford?start=60,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.8600000000000003,3.1600000000000006

140,Leigh A.,"Rochester, NY",0,4,1.0,1.0,2014-04-16,"I went in today for a quick ""something"" to eat. I was tired and needed some caffeine and something in my stomach before a work engagement this evening. I sat at the bar, and told the bartender I had 30 minutes before I had to leave and I wanted to grab a quick bite. I was the only one seated at the bar, though he was cranking out drinks as it was 5:30 p.m. and the restaurant was picking up the pace for happy hour table service. I ordered a cappuccino, and it came out promptly, though the mug was dirty.  I asked for a glass of water, which was oddly only filled 1/2 way. Then, because I was in a strange mood and couldn't figure out what to order, I asked for a french dip sandwich (goes by something else there but I can't recall the name).  The bartender was average. Not overly nice and welcoming, but not rude either. Honestly, I would expect a tiny bit more hospitality from him being that I was the *only* one at the bar.  20 minutes goes by, and still no sandwich. At this point, with 10 minutes before I have to leave, I told the bartender I had to leave soon and for him to please ask that they just put it in a to-go container. They bring out the sandwich about three minutes later, in a to go container.  I still have about 7 minutes before I have to leave, and I want a bit of it, so I open the container at the bar.  I notice right away that the horseradish sauce that goes with the sandwich is barely 1/3 full, it was a tiny amount, not nearly enough for the ratio of the sandwich. Fail. Then, I quickly notice that there is barely any meat on the sandwich.  I glance at the bill to remember how much this little deal is costing - $14.95.  Normally I'm not a price-conscious person insofar as I'll order what I want within reason and don't consider price as a forefront in my decision making; I can afford it. But who likes to get ripped off? It you want to charge me $15 for a small piece of skinny french baguette and some sliced beef, it better be damn good quality.  Well, it wasn't.  The first piece of beef I saw in my sandwich was *covered* with fatty grizzle - totally inedible.  It was a big piece that a line cook should've immediately nixed from being part of a dish. Totally unappetizing, and it validated quickly my first impressions of the sandwich as being a sub-par rip off. Then, I take a bite of the sandwich, after I pulled out the fatty/grizzly piece.  There was a DISGUSTING piece of something foreign in my sandwich. I don't even know what it was.  I was about 4 inches, and stalk-like, though old and dried up, like a straw. I have no idea if it was a once-edible item, or a completely inedible piece of wood or something, but it literally made my stomach turn.  I have been nauseous since this experience, all night, I am not even kidding.  The bartender tapped out after I showed him what was in my sandwich.  I'm not sure if he apologized. If he did, it was obviously unmemorable and insincere.  I asked to see the manager.  A young lady, pleasant, came over and I explained the situation.  I told her that the bartender was nice and it had nothing to do with him (not exactly true, in retrospect, insofar as my overall satisfaction and experience).  I had to tell her I wasn't paying for the sandwich - s",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pittsford?start=140,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.6600000000000006,3.1600000000000006

We wanted to do happy hour but were unable to make it between 4 and 6 (they need to extend it to 7!) I opted for my usual- buffalo chicken blast. They were great as always! They give you about 9 so I always order it as a meal and have leftovers to take home. I will be having it for lunch today lol. I washed that down with a pear martini- it was soooooo yummy! That was the best drink I've had at Cheesecake Factory! I suggest that for anyone- but do be aware it costs $10.50- a little on the pricey side in my opinion. My girlfriend ordered the tamale appetizer- it was very tasty and they give you a lot. Unfortunately she did not like the mushy consistency of the dish and ordered the Hawaiian pizza instead. It came out fast and was very hot. The waitress had no problem switching her dish. I opted for the dulce de leche cheesecake. Hands down one of my new favorites! It was delicious. I recommend it for anyone who likes caramel.  Although it was a busy Friday night we only had to wait 20 minutes and our waitress was very attentive. I normally don't make it a habit to spend $30 on a drink/ appetizer/ desert but this is rather average for the Cheesecake Factory.

The food is average.  It's certainly nothing to write home about.  We got the mushroom, avocado, and zucchini fries, which were decent, but I would have liked better dipping sauces (it came with a ranch and a mustard one, but I didn't think they complimented the fries well).  I got the pasta carbonara, with gluten free pasta.  The best part about it was the gluten free pasta, which was not overcooked.  The rest of it was okay, but it tasted more like thin alfredo sauce with bacon and peas.  My boyfriend got the turkey burger, which he took a few bites of and stopped eating.  He said it made him feel sick.

Well, we have only been to this place when we are in a very large group and have always made an awful lot of noise. Those sitting around us probably hate us, but nobody has ever complained. So it is a pretty good destination if you are a loud group.  The food is just ok; very greasy and far from what a good local restaurant would offer. My favorite pasta here ""pasta De Vinci"" is way too sweet, which I assume makes you wonder why I keep ordering it. It has proven to be better than other pasta dishes here. The portions are pretty big and with the huge amount of greasy, sugary ingredients added to every dish, one cannot finish up one dish by themselves.  Overall, it is ok, not a place where I would look forward to my next visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pittsford?start=40,3.08,3.08,3.08,2.8280000000000003,3.0800000000000005
75,Kenneth F.,"Geneva, NY",48,92,131.0,3.0,2014-12-15,"This is the first time coming to this location and business since we moved here from the west coast. My parents got us gift cards and we looked forward to this. We arrived and were seated quickly (it wasn't busy). We knew we wanted the avocado egg rolls because they are delicious (sweet and creamy, plus avocados cost a lot in NY). We ordered 2 strawberry lemonades (very sweet and yummy). My wife ordered orange chicken and I decided to order Pit Beef Dip (the description sounds awesome). Well we received our appetizer and bread but it seemed to take a while to get our entrees. I couldn't wait to bite into this steak and caramelized onions with the cheese and dipping sauce. As my eyes looked upon my food I could see thick cuts of onion not caramelized and pretty pink looking meat. I took a bite and almost ALL the meat came out. It was a big blob of fatty chewy disgust. It tasted as if the meat wasn't cooked enough and I immediately took it out of my mouth and pushed the plate to the end of the table. I couldn't even eat the fries, WAY to much salt.  Our waitress finally came back and asked if something was wrong (hence the whole plate not eaten) and I told her it was a disgusting mess and to please take away. She asked if I wanted something else instead and so I thought of something fast and basic they couldn't screw up so I ordered a basic cheeseburger. I had fun getting to watch my wife eat her food and then when my burger came she got to watch me. The burger was juicy and good for a 11.00 burger. We ended up not getting cheesecake or dessert after this. They comp'd the dog chew sandwich and I ended up paying for the cheeseburger (a 2.00 difference).  We won't be back for a long time. It was just a bad choice I guess and I suggest no one else order it.

First off I love that they have Coke Zero - me and my husband have mild addictions. The bread this time wasn't warm and the butter was rock hard - makes it interesting - although I really like their whole grain bread. I got the Imperial chicken and shrimp which was super tasty and like that I could get brown rice instead of white. A little deceiving in that it was 85% chicken and maybe 2 pieces of shrimp - but had a great crunch even in the Asian sauce and nice bright chunks of ginger. My husband got the Romano crusted chicken which was described a ""light tomato sauce"" which was actually a tomato sauce made with heavy cream - tasted good though.  My husband got the S'mores cheesecake with toasted marshmallow topping and it was soooo good! I got the Reese PB Cup Chocolate cake cheesecake and it was okay but the cake portion was dry and it had peanuts in it (I didn't remember seeing that in the description) - which I wasn't a fan of - made for some odd textures with the cheesecake. We only were able to eat a couple bites of the cheesecake - so they are in the fridge. You guys gotta try that S'mores cheesecake!

I was somewhat dreading the occasion 1) because it's a chain, for which I never have high hopes, and 2) because I hadn't had time to look at the menu ahead of time and that gives me mild anxiety. AHHH.  My lunch companion and I were seated very quickly, and our waitress was very quick to greet us and take our orders. We were asked if we wanted bread - umm, yes, I always want carbs. Hit me. The butter is in pre-wrapped little patts that were semi frozen. The sourdough and the honey wheat breads were good though! And warm! My friend got the spaghetti and meatballs, and I got a caesar salad - we were feeling SO adventurous, I know. Our food came out at the same time, yay! I hate having to awkwardly wait when entrees don't come out at the same time.  The food was very good, my croutons were amazeballs, they tasted like garlic bread (they probably WERE garlic bread at one time). The portions were gigantic, which is always okay with me. I paid $9.95 for a salad that would've been big enough to get 2 meals out of (but dressed salad doesn't keep well, so I ate it all.) The cheesecakes in the display case looked awesome, but I had a day drinking appointment to keep later in the day, so I opted for no cheesecake this time. One must have priorities, right?

83,Mike M.,"Rochester, NY",39,126,98.0,1.0,2015-05-20,"Let me premise this review what the fact that I rarely go to chain restaurant's when I want a nice meal. I find compared to locally owned and operated options they have inferior food, cooked less originally, by frugally trained chefs, who hand the food off to waitresses who could rarely give a crap. Now that being said, my fiancé recently lamented the fact that she had never had the chance to try visit Cheesecake Factory, so I thought we'd give it a try. Although my expectations were low, I was willing to give it a chance.   We were taken to a table shortly after we arrived, it was just the two of us. Our table was a half booth half table and my fiancé inquired where I wanted to sit. I told her I'd be on the inside as the table are more or less on top of one another and you're sitting shoulder to shoulder with your neighbor. We wouldn't want to sacrifice a little space for some ambiance right guys? Praise the almighty dollar! I knew she'd be a bit claustrophobic so I said I'd sit inside. Now mind you, I'm 6'3"" and don't fit well in small places but that's what us gentlemen do for our ladies. Our waitress had this to comment, to my Fiancé "" Oh don't feel bad, my butt can't fit back their either"".... WTF? DO you have train them or just give them an apron and tell them to ""Go at it!"" ?   So moving on we began to explore your menus. We noticed that they are quite large and you offer an impressive amount of dishes. Here's the thing though, well two things. One, when it comes to food, less can be more. There is no way you actually have a staff with the experience to cook a dozen varieties of cuisine well! You just don't. Secondly is this. Specialty is defined as ""a pursuit, area of study, or skill to which someone has devoted much time and effort and in which they are expert."" That doesn't apply to any food you turn out and it definitely does not describe 3/4 of your menu even though you claim they are all specialties.   We settled on the crab and artichoke dip, Cajun Fried Catfish and Herb Roasted Chicken. When our waitress returned we informed her of our order. I had also noticed a chicken and biscuit dish on the menu. I admitted it may be a little unusual but I told her I'd like to order some biscuits as well. Her immediate and unwavering response was ""No."" Not ""let me check with my manager"" not ""Let me check for you"" just ""No."" With no explanation or reason why. So I of coarse ask why not? She informed I just wasn't allowed to. And that's all she would say. Again, do you even train your staff? At all?   Our first encounter with food was our Crab and Artichoke dip, it had a decent flavor, no actual crab that we could find, but it was ok. It was delivered by someone who was not our server as she was somewhere else doing something else. About this time I was wishing for my biscuits and I notice that every other table in sight has bread on it. Now after asking around I found out that bread should have been brought early in the meal but apparently our server just didn't give a crap. Even when she properly defended the magic biscuits that corporate says the customer is not allowed to have ""because."" Wouldn't someone with half a brain say  "" Hey, what a minute, I can't give you the magic nom nom biscuits of deliciousness because.... BUT I could bring you some delightful bread and butter?"" But no, that didn't happen. Why? Inept, poorly trained staff.   So eventually our entrées come, they were delivered by someone who was not our server as again she was somewhere else doing something else. SO we try it. Let's start with the good. The mashed potatoes were very very edible. I'm not going to claim they were in my top 20 but they are mashed potatoes, you did OK. Good job. Second the shake and bake chicken was a bit dry but again, it was edible. Boring, and sad that it is something you claim to have ""a pursuit, area of study, or skill to which someone has devoted much time and effort and in which they are expert."" But ok. The green beans where cold, still in their canned water and utterly devoid of anything to even resemble seasoning. Lastly the Piece de resistance. The Cajun Fried Catfish. Has anyone you employee ever actually eaten Cajun food or real Cajun catfish? Your biggest flaws were the COMPLETE lack of any seasonings on the ""CAJUN"" catfish, the fact it was cold (this is very bad) and lastly it was in no way crispy. Your tartar sauce was somewhat Cajun flavored. However, I did not order plan catfish with Cajun tartar sauce, did I?   Oh by the way, not to worry. Our waitress did eventually show back up. She let us know she had been using the bathroom for the last 30 minutes but was ""super sorry"" she hadn't ya know, brought us any food or every checked in with us to see if it was ok. The one positive was that this did help enforce to the fiancé why we don't go to chain restaurants for nice meals.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pittsford?start=80,3.36,3.36,3.36,2.436,3.3600000000000003

79,David K.,"Rochester, NY",2,11,,2.0,2015-11-16,"Went there on Saturday 11/14th with a party of 10 people.  We arrived at 1:30pm and were seated around 2:15pm.  It took 1/2 hour just to get our (non-alcoholic) drinks.  We placed our food orders at the same time as our drink orders.  It took another 45 minutes to get our food after getting our drinks.  None of the people at my end of the table were too thrilled with the food.  The burgers were small, dry and served on an over sized bun.  The french fries were way to salty.  My friends Chicken and biscuits looked horrible.  The chicken was dry like cardboard, and the vegetables looked like something out of a can thats been sitting in the fridge for a few weeks.  Another ordered the Falafel Salad, she said it was very spicy and barely ate any of it.  When mentioned to the server, she basically shrugged her shoulders.  After finishing what we could, it was another 1/2 hour trying to track down someone to give us our checks. The last time I was here was about a year ago.  The food and service was much better last time.  Based on this visit, it'll be unlikely that I come here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pittsford?start=60,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.216,3.3200000000000003
39,Mel B.,"Rochester, NY",92,100,1266.0,4.0,2015-11-21,"Enjoying the experience at the Cheesecake Factory takes knowing what to order. The location in Pittsford is somewhat intimidating because of the high traffic in the parking lot and the long wait after 6 p.m. on a weekend night (and yes, I get that it is a chain). Yet, the lengthy menu boasts some menu options that are unique in their own right, and you can customize them to make them more of your own. I recommend to anyone to start with the Green Iced Tea (it's minty!) and the Corn Cake Tamales. They are colorful, California meets Tex-Mex, and fun to eat for $10. The ""appetizer"" comes with three large corn cakes, topped with sour cream, pico de gallo, avocado, and surrounded with tomatillo sauce. There are cute corn husk tails sticking out from either end. Say what you will, but I am excited every time I get this dish. My tip is to ask for grilled chicken on top ($3 extra) and to make it a meal.  I also recommend the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps for the exciting plating (walls of green lettuce and purple cabbage) and color of the dish. The grilled chicken and vegetables are fresher in quality, and make you feel better that you are going to cap off the experience with a cheesecake. My go-to cheesecake is the Vanilla bean cheesecake. It sounds boring, but the tartness of the cheesecake is cut by the smoothness of the vanilla bean and graham cracker crust! So delicious! I made Naz B. come with me recently, and she tried the Godiva chocolate cheesecake. We both agreed that it could have used a raspberry sauce. It is pretty rich with chocolate flavor and pretty divine if you have a craving for the cocoa bean, rather than the vanilla.  The atmosphere here is Las Vegas Egyptian Room meets the Palm Room at the Plaza. The high ceilings and forced grandness is somewhat undercut by the tvs playing sports near the bar and the busy rows of tables lining the place. Try to get a dark wood paneled booth if you can. It gives you a sense of intimacy among the loud chatter, and you don't have to share elbow space with your fellow diners.  I like coming to this place for lunch or dinner. The lunch hour during the week is pretty chill, and the big windows let in lots of light. It makes me feel like I am in a big city when I visit, and the excitement for my corn cakes makes it worth a trip every few months.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pittsford,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.48,3.2800000000000002

92,Kristina M.,"Rochester, NY",0,11,2.0,1.0,2016-01-09,Where to begin...I picked the cheese cake factory to celebrate my 25th birthday with my husband last night. Neither of us had ever been so we were excited to go! We already knew it would be pretty busy being a Friday night. People waiting were just piled at the front door waiting for their table pagers to go off. After FINALLY guessing and finding the hostess booth there were ONLY TWO hostess..stood there for a second waiting for one of the girls to look up and ask how they could help or how many in my party. Two seconds later another lady barges past me and ask how long of a wait...thanks.

37,Josh M.,"Manhattan, NY",541,532,2449.0,4.0,2016-01-19,I'm a big fan of the cheesecake factory.  The cheesecake factory is still a chain but the ambience inside makes it feel a little bit more upscale. Great place to eat for business or a date.  There aren't any cheesecake factory locations in New York City. So every chance To eat a a cheesecake factory I try to go. I have been to a few locations in White Plains and in Newark. I had to stop through Pittsford for a meeting for work and I noticed that they had a cheesecake factory in town. Right next-door was an Applebee's. I looked at the Applebee's then I looked at the cheesecake factory and it's a no-brainer the cheesecake factory is the winner.  Most of the food served at the cheesecake factory is Italian style. They do have other types of cuisine on the menu. I recommend asking about the specials. Every day there are new specials that the cheesecake factory offers. The day that I went to the soup of the day was the corn chowder. I'm not really a big fan of corn chowder but I figured I would try some. The soup was absolutely delicious I could've just had the soup for lunch. I ended up getting a flat bread. The flat bread was very good. You could really taste how fresh the ingredients were. Simple and fresh is the best.  The person that Was joining me had the southwestern salad with grilled chicken. The salad was so big that two people could have shared it and still had leftovers. You could come here to eat for lunch or you could definitely take a date here. Setting is a little bit more moody.  Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable of the menu he did not have to write anything down he knew the menu front for back as well as the wine list. I was extremely impressed by his knowledge and how he handled himself as our waiter. I was so impressed that I told him I eat out a lot a very expensive restaurants and sometimes I don't even get that kind of a service at a very expensive restaurant that cost $80-$100 per person. I cannot remember his name but if you do read this review I am extremely impressed by your energy enthusiasm and knowledge of the menu.  Overall the cheesecake factory is definitely one of my favorite chains out there. If I'm in any city and there's a cheesecake factory I will definitely eat there. I highly recommend eating at any of the cheesecake factories.  PROS: - ambience is great.  -our waiter was knowledgeable and enthusiastic -food is simple and taste great,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pittsford,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.576,3.2000000000000006

Anyway, it's safe to say that things have taken a turn downhill in recent years as far as the food and service alike. I still have love for Cheesecake Factory, but I'm just not in love with it. My husband's all time favorite Steak Dianne With Chicken Madera combo was so bad the last few visits that he opted not to order it again and just to try something different altogether. My food has been okay, nothing special but I will say that the Adam's Peanut Butter cheesecake is amazing! It is my newest favorite. Cheesecake Factory seems overcrowded almost always despite having a large dining facility. Additionally, the waitstaff always seem overworked and frazzled. On our last visit, my husband left the table only to return and his chair was missing. Even though eight of us were sitting in the booth, someone walked by and swiped his chair because they noticed it was empty. The manger quickly replaced the chair and apologized but we were all baffled. We also witnessed a waiter spill several glasses of red wine on a gentleman at the booth behind us. Obviously their food was comped by management, but again this points back to an overworked staff. Cheesecake needs to hire more people and with more hands on deck, service should drastically improve.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pittsford?start=20,2.88,2.88,2.88,2.572,2.88

127,Michael B.,"Philadelphia, PA",16,46,,1.0,2016-03-19,"Last Wednesday my wife, myself, and our infant daughter attempted to go here for dinner. We asked if we could be seated in a place where we could have our stroller with us, so our daughter could sleep in it if she chose. The hostess brought us to a table, and said we could keep the stroller in front of the table, which was located right in the main walkway of the restaurant, and would block everyone attempting to walk through in any direction. I looked around the restaurant, and saw many booths open that would perfectly accommodate what my wife and I were looking for. The hostess said no to all of the open booths, but did not explain why. We then said we couldn't stay without a different table since we had our infant. She said that was fine, so we left. It was very clear that she did not want to help us out in any manner, and it actually felt as if she didn't want us to stay. It would be different if it had been a busy night and they didn't have open tables. However, it would have been very easy for them to accommodate us. Other restaurants have had no issue with our request. The hostess was extremely rude.

They moved fluidly, they were genuine and worked pretty hard. We ordered the chicken Madeira and shrimp+chicken gumbo. Both very good choices. The chicken was moist and flavour very balanced. The madeira flavour came through without being overpowring, and for the gumbo, the creaminess of the dish was cut by the tomatoes and white rice. Portions are v generous but we managed to finish them.  For dessert, we have the raspberry lemon cheesecake, at the recommendation of our server. Absolutely delicious, simply one of th tastiest cheesecakes ever. Creamy but not too heavy, fragrant and lemony and served with whipped cream and a raspberry lemon coulis.

13,Ed L.,"West Covina, CA",0,29,4.0,1.0,2016-05-15,"Someone wrote ""Amazing service""?? Amazing in what way? Amazingly bad? I love Cheesecake Factory everywhere else, Los Angeles, New York City, Chicago, Ohio. I grew up in Pittsford so I was pleased to see one had opened here in my hometown.  APPALLING TELEPHONE SERVICE I brought my 92 year old father (handicapped plaque) so I called ahead to ask (just ask) whether they accept call ahead seating for elderly/handicapped customers. It was just for us two.  Jessica repeated many times that she can't do anything and we would wait 10-15 minutes for a table and can't be on the list until we arrived. I said it sounds like they don't offer any considerations for seniors or handicapped people. She put me on hold to ""go ask her manager"".  About 5 minutes later, Manager (name starts with J) comes to the phone and says ""hello?"" Without announcing herself as the manager. So I explain I'm waiting for Jessica to come back after asking a manager about call ahead seating for elderly/handicapped patrons. The manager took many long, repeated sentences to imply I was asking for unfairly special treatment, that there was nothing they can or would do to accommodate an elderly person other than ""pulling up a chair for him to sit on or giving him a drink while he waits"" and she had the nerve to make it a point ""there are many other handicapped customers waiting there"" at the time too!  I said sarcastically that I would never think of cutting the line in front of other seniors or handicapped customers! She just kept implying I was asking too much.  HORRIBLE HOSTESS SERVICE Since I was driving while talking to her, I got there in less than 5 minutes and my dad (he is hunched over 90 degrees) asked the hostess for a number. 1) There were ZERO OTHER HANDICAPPED CUSTOMERS. 2) There were no seats available and neither of the two hostesses offered him a seat 3) we still waited exactly 15 minutes for a table! DEPLORABLE TABLE SERVICE (Receipt 0542, 5/15/16 19:58, Rec 459. Table 21. Term 9) Our server seated us, told us the normal server is on lunch break, and ran off hastily. (The receipt says Ashley A but I don't know which one is Ashley.) my complaint is with the ""fill in"" server, a light toned woman in her 20s with glasses and long dark hair. The normal server is African-American and I had no issue with her. ""Ms. Fill In server"" hastily ran off to help other tables. Fine, I get that. We saw her maybe 15x during the first 30 minutes of the meal but she only came to our table twice! She said she was checking on the bread and would bring it to us as soon as it was done baking. AFTER 10 MINUTES SHE BROUGHT US THE BREAD AND IT WAS STONE COLD AND ROCK HARD!! Sure, it was still baking? THEY BROUGHT OUR ENTREES AND AT THE SAME TIME MS. FILL-IN-SERVER CLEARED AWAY BOTH OUR SMALL EMPTY BREAD PLATES BUT LEFT THE BUTTER AND BASKET OF (ICE COLD) BREAD WHERE IT WAS! I HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS DONE BEFORE AND DONT UNDERSTAND THE LOGIC! MY DAD AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO PUT OUR BREAD AFTER BUTTERING IT! AWKWARD!! TINY PORTIONS!! I had a chicken chili over rice entree. The entire goulash fit into the tiny 6"" x 1"" center portion of a huge bowl. I ate it all in 10 spoonfuls and was still starving. I don't know how the other reviewer of 2 months ago could have gotten huge portions? The part I was most disappointed with was Ms Fill-in Server stopped by after we had been served, asked robotically ""how is everything tasting?"" When I clearly hadn't even touched my entree yet (I was busy tearing apart the COLD HARD BREAD) and when I immediately looked up at her and answered ""I hadn't tried the food yet..."" THE SERVER WAS STILL STANDING AT MY TABLE FACING ME BUT WAS STARING ACROSS THE ROOM AT SOMETHING ELSE!! WAS THAT INSULTING!! SHE DISNT EVEN HEAR WHAT I SAID AND RAN OFF WITHOUT LISTENING!!  DISHONEST GRATUITY GUIDELINES Tip is optional. The tip is always a % of the meal total bill BEFORE TAXES. Not at this dishonest establishment! They print the tip guidelines on your receipt and I clearly see the 15, 20 and 25% are based on the total bill INCLUDING TAX! This is intended to deceive customers into paying 10% more tip than they intended to pay (for example if you intend to pay 20% of the meal amount, you actually pay 22% because you're paying 20% of the meal plus taxes)!

I personally had the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp for $19.50. Where do I start on this flavorless overpriced dish... Well, for starters the rice was not cooked correctly AKA literally got crunchy rice.

86,Michael M.,"Rochester, NY",18,70,1.0,2.0,2016-07-24,"I debated between 1 and 2 stars and settled on 2 as the service was friendly albeit slow and incompetent and not all of the food was disgusting. I ordered a special - pan seared salmon with broccoli and mashed potatoes. The sides were decent (the mashed potatoes had the taste and consistency of being hand mashed) and the salmon was well-prepared although strangely covered in sliced mushrooms that really did nothing to complement the salmon. This dish was in sharp contrast with the repulsive pasta Alfredo dish off of the children's menu.  The Alfredo sauce (presumably the same as offered on the regular menu) tasted like brine. My child said it was ok, probably not wanting me to cause embarrassment by sending back -- which in retrospect I should have as it was uneaten. The other children's dishes (noodles and butter- something that is hard to ruin) were fine (and enough to share with the unfortunate sibling stuck with bow tie pasta covered in pickle juice). The meatballs that came with the pasta were nothing special and undoubtedly not made fresh. I actually like their cheesecakes a lot (although I understand the perspective of the purists who don't believe they qualify as cheesecake). So no complaints there. The sundaes off the children's menu are overpriced for what you get.  The service was awkward. It wasn't slow (except for refilling water which I desperately needed after eating just one of those bow ties) but simply not good. For example she cleared some plates but left a bunch uncleared after taking our dessert order. A while later a manager (?) walked by and asked if he could clear some plates. After he grabbed a couple I piled up what was left and put in the corner of he table expecting the waitress to return to get them.

For dessert we had the Godiva chocolate cheesecake with chocolate fudge. With one layer of chocolate cake, second layer of cheesecake and the third layer of fudge mousse, this piece of heaven got me sugar-high.

We were seated by a very friendly hostess and then the waiting game began... we waited for twenty minutes before our server came over to us to even start with drink orders.  From there, we had to fight to get bread at the table by reminding our waitress repeatedly of our need. Then we ordered our entrees...and waited...and waited... Finally, the waitress came over and confirmed the order with us, claiming that there was a computer problem for the past half-an-hour so she was unable to ring in the order. We felt like she had completely forgotten about us and that she didn't even ring in the order in the first place. We were really looking forward to the food so we were glad to wait a little longer.  While we waited, a busser came over to clear the table next to ours. In the process of doing so, he knocked over a glass, which completely drenched my right leg in whatever liquid was in the glass. No apology, just an, ""oops,"" was all I got. Fine... the food would make up for it. The food was repulsive.

You know when you get to a restaurant, look at the menu, and can't decide what to get because nothing really pops out but there's a billion things you could see yourself eating because the menu is so big? That's the Cheesecake factory and they're really good at highlighting your indecisive tendencies.  Gigantic menu, large portions, interesting drinks. It's a chain so there's really no variation. We went there are a group for lunch and it wasn't too bad. I feel strange ordering what I see as a dinner dish for lunch, so I went with a Cuban. It was pretty good, the bread being the star of the sandwich... it was the best part.  But let's be honest, you go to the cheesecake factory for the cheesecake. There are tons of different varieties, from plain cheesecake to the triple chocolate fudge extravaganza. I'm not sure if the last cheesecake is actually a type, but I'm sure I'm not far off.

Every once in a while my family and I go to the Cheesecake Factory. My favorite thing to get at the Cheesecake Factory is the mac and cheese which has a crispy crumb coated macaroni and cheese. My favorite thing about this restaurant is their cheesecake, which is what they are known for. There cheesecake is the best cheesecake I've ever had! My favorite kinds of cheesecake are the Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake, the Brownie Fudge Cheesecake, the Key Lime Cheesecake, and the Snickers Bar Chunks cheesecake!  The Reese's Peanut Butter cheesecake has Reese's peanut butter cups in our original cheesecake with layers of delicious fudge cake and caramel! The Key Lime Cheesecake has key lime pie in a cheesecake; it is deliciously tart and creamy on a vanilla crumb crust! The Brownie Fudge cheesecake is a walnut-brownie cheesecake and white chocolate mousse covered with hot fudge and almonds. The one thing that I don't like about the cheesecake is how rich and filling it is. After a big meal of theirs it is very hard to finish a cheesecake on top of what you just ate! The service at the restaurant is okay depending on how crowded it is. If it is really crowded they are slower than usual, but if it is not crowed the normally will come within a few minutes after you get seated. The food takes a good 20-30 mins to come after you order. The food there can be very expensive depending on what you order.

It's typically busy here though they have a lot of tables and it's not difficult to get a seat. A lot of the seats are tables with chairs on one side and a long booth down the other.

Apps we're good - Cuban Rolls and a fried pocket thing Erin ordered Meals: My ""appetizer mixed Veggies Salad was good, Roy liked his Margherita Pizza, Connie's was good, most of Gail's was good - discovered some rubbery chicken towards the end of the meal. Erin's salmon was a different story. The carrots had a slight spice heat she couldn't do - no harm, no foul, the waitress swapped out for rice and replated.  The pile of rice could have fed three or four. After serving the swap she never stopped or slowed near our table again. We finally had to ask another server for her. The salmon was way over cooked and the Broccoli soggy. We were willing to see if some teryaki sauce would have made less dry but by the time we finally got her to the table again it was ice. We told waitress about meal, asked for the manager. He took off the bill but we had to ask to SEE him twice. When he came he apologized perfunctly, said he took off the bill. When we explained about the MIA waitress he copped to them being busy - they had steady business but no stopping by for over 1/2 hour - no. That excuse doesn't cut it. I told him we both had experience in retail and I in restaurant service. Some things we talk to waitress about, others we ask for the manager.  He was perfunctory, but just wanted us gone.

23,Andrew P.,"Rochester, NY",232,146,336.0,4.0,2017-07-14,"This is a nice restaurant that I've been a patron for years. The staff is always friendly and the food is decent. It's admirable (and disheartening to my diet) that all the items on the menu displays the calorie amount! It doesn't stop me from ordering an entree, but there's so much food that I only eat a half portion. The textbook of a menu boasts a diverse selection of food, but the items I usually come for are: Chicken Carbonara: Huge portion, very cheesey and smooth sauce, perfect amount of grilled chicken to accommodate the pasta and peas. Buffalo wings: I'm a big fan at how crispy the wings are despite being doused with a copious amount of hot sauce, and the size and amount of wings can pretty much stand in as a meal! Cheesecake: Need I say more? They presentation and taste of them are unrivaled. TREAT YO SELF!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pittsford,3.44,3.13,3.13,,3.254

Wait staff are normally cheerful and helpful.  Today's server seemed like he'd rather have been anywhere but at our table.  Not sure why because we tend not to be too annoying.  One of us ordered a salad that had more dead lettuce than it should have given this season of fresh produce. Still, we enjoy this place and hope the experience was just an off day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pittsford,3.52,3.15,3.15,,3.298
9,Maribelle N.,"Melbourne, FL",0,19,,3.0,2017-07-17,"Went last night.. food was very good, drinks were a little pricey (almost $12 for a cosmo) but good. Our server was wonderful, friendly and efficient. Only disappointment (and it's a big one) was the Cheesecake. We got slices to go, since we were stuffed from appetizers and dinner. If I had eaten it there, I probably would have sent it back. The crust was soggy, the caramel was thick and old... it's like the cake was beyond fresh date but sold instead of tossing out. Same thing with my husbands slice. IF we go back I will likely ask not necessarily for my favorite kind, but the freshest one at that time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pittsford?start=20,3.44,3.13,3.13,,3.254

22,Sun B.,"Cupertino, CA",0,36,,2.0,2017-08-14,"I had to knock off 2 stars for what happened after the meal. Read on Had Eggplant Parmesan, Spicy Chipotle Chicken, Spicy Cashew nut chicken and Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp & Chicken. Portions were huge for everything. The Eggplant had 3 huge pieces which my friend said was not up to the status of Olive Garden. So I guess bad? The cashew nut chicken was good but more sweet than spicy with a tangy sauce and brown rice. Chipotle chicken was slightly spicy but good with crispy pasta. The Jamaican shrimp was not that spicy either but my friends liked it. Also had fried sweet plantains which went will with the shrimp.  The service was good and fast during the meal.  But we ordered 2 slices of cheesecake to go. When we got home we found that the cheesecake was missing. On going back the next day the manager had us find the receipt and then gave us the slices. She did not bother to even apologize for the mistake. At this point my friend asked her to replace one of the choices with a different on of the same price. The manager said no saying that she had to meet inventory (no idea what that meant since obviously had not noticed 2 extra slices the night before ). On further insistence she finally gave in. I did not expect such resistance when we had to drive twice to get our food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pittsford,3.4,3.13,3.13,,3.238
15,Marialis R.,"Rochester, NY",0,1,,5.0,2017-08-21,"Update: Best cheesecake ever!! Entire family loved it. Going back this weekend!! This was the first time I have came into a Cheescake Factory. I was nervous since when I pulled up there were so many vehicles and all I was going for was to buy a cheesecake for my husbands birthday. The inside was busy but the front was fast service and kind!!  Well, I was surprised at the prices but then saw the pieces and they're huge. So I went ahead and bought a 7inch one along with a slice for my daughter to try. Paid for it and the server went back to get it for me. She came back with a bad news good news comment and I was initially nervous. She said they were out of the 7 inch one that I purchased but that the manager gave the okay to give me the 10 inch one at no extra charge. I am impressed because other places wouldn't have done that! I must give them great review since they saved my husbands birthday. He really wanted that one and could just afford the 7 inch. Thank you and they've won a customer for life!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pittsford?start=20,3.48,3.13,3.13,,3.27
14,K H.,"Webster, NY",0,22,,1.0,2017-08-24,"I do curb takeout due to handicap. Last night I ordered crispy Cuban rolls. I got a creamy white dipping sauce that ruined the appetizer. I called and the manager said the new sauce is a Corporate decision. Really? French country salad which I love was full of bitter red leaves which I think was Radiccio with 2 pieces of goat cheese and about 1 pecan crushed up. Tasted nothing like which I ordered many times. Lastly, my love for their cheesecake is gone. The new Celebration cheesecake is bland, blah!

57,Andrea S.,"Walworth, NY",1,15,,3.0,2017-08-27,"We have been here plenty of times, and normally I would give them five stars for food and service, but the last few times were disappointing. They seem to run out of the same items. This was the second consecutive time they ran out of avocado egg rolls (which are divine if you've never had them). Oddly enough they still had guacamole--which when it came with my meal was a bit brown. Tasty, but not appetizing. So we then ordered the crab and artichoke dip. Guess what--out of that, too. Really? On a Saturday evening?  Skip to dinner and my black beans were hard--we're talking hard enough that whoever scooped them out should've known they were undercooked. The server was apologetic and willing to get me more, but since my son's were also undercooked, I doubted a new batch would be any different. The server also did offer to get me a different side, but I'm sure by the time it arrived we would all be done eating. We will probably be back, but I'm hoping that our next experience is a better one. If it's not, we may not come back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pittsford?start=40,3.28,3.12,3.12,,3.1840000000000006
26,Patricia B.,"East Rochester, NY",4,33,7.0,5.0,2017-10-16,I was out shopping at the pittsford plaza- did not realize it was past lunch time. Greeted nicely and got a table near the bar area. It was quite lively as students were off from college. Two senior ladies sat next to me and spoke very low. Enjoyed a glass of prosecco infused with fruit picked me up from having an eye exam & quick trip to TJ MAXX. Wow needed to relax had a slim size chicken slider with a side salad. Warm bread and a sweet smile from my server. Finished up and headed home to check in on my pup.

EGGPLANT PARMESAN Eggplant Lightly Coated with Parmesan Breadcrumbs and Cooked Crisp. Covered with Mozzarella Cheese, Fontina Cheese and Marinara Sauce. Served with Pesto Pasta.
