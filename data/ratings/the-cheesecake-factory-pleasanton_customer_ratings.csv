955,Christina L.,"Pleasanton, CA",94,38,,4.0,2012-01-02,"A must when you live in the area. Before the one in Pleasanton arrived it was always a treat to go to the one on top of Macy's in SF. Since it came to Stoneridge iris usually the go-to for my friends and I. I have never had anything there that I didn't enjoy. The drinks, while expensive, are all delicious and the warm bread given before any meal is a treat and always has to be replaced.

1157,Kelli S.,"Antioch, CA",121,31,6.0,2.0,2012-01-04,"Went to my niece's birthday 11/11/11, of course they were crowded as usual.  Told us 45 minutes, so we went into the mall and they were calling us 15 minutes later.  Okay.  Our waiter, obviously overworked.  Somehow, they managed to deliver my niece's burger to the wrong table, but instead of an explanation up front, they just set everyone else's food down and went on about their business.  I had to flag him down once he stopped ducking around corners and then he said ""Oh the manager hasn't come over yet?""  Not that anyone informed us that a manager was coming.  Then one manager comes into our section but starts with a different customer, party of 1 + baby instead of our party of 7.  Apparently this customer had a lot of complaints because then the manager sat down.  Niece - still no food.  Her birthday. So finally another manager comes over and starts asking if my niece wants soup or salad.  I flagged her over and told her ""she didn't order soup or salad, she ordered a burger, and we've been waiting so long, I'm sure it's ready, so go get it"".  Which she promptly did, which means it was probably getting cold because by this time our original server was gone on break.  The didn't try to accomodate my niece in any other way.  We asked the new server to remove the burger from the bill and he got super defensive saying that he didn't know, etc.  No one expected him to know, but go ask the manager to remove it now and save the attitude for later. When it was removed and they brought me my change, the money was ripped in half.  I asked for bills that weren't ripped so that I could use them for BART and got a total eye roll and more attitude.  Heavy sigh, I didn't tell you to get a job at the Cheesecake Factory.  LUCKILY, their food is consistent and usually good.

1130,Kailey M.,"Livermore, CA",17,37,5.0,3.0,2012-01-06,"I have been going to this Cheesecake Factory for quite a while and have a few select items on the menu that are my favorites, especially the avocado egg rolls. YUM!  I have a life threatening food allergy, so it's imperative for me to be careful with what I select, so I always order one of the same things I've ordered before. I normally NEVER have a problem when I come here as the waiters and waitresses are always accommodating and understanding when I tell them about my allergy. I don't expect any special treatment or exceptions, I just need to be careful about what I order.  Although I always order ""safe"" items off the menu, my last visit to the Cheesecake Factory ended with me in the emergency room. I don't blame the restaurant as I understand that things happen and that's the risk that I take by eating out. However, when I went back to explain to the manager what had happened and asked for some insight on how to prevent it from happening again, he blew me off and was completely rude. He didn't offer any sort of apology and consistently tried to cover his ass as if I was accusing them of doing something wrong. Clearly someone screwed up somewhere otherwise I wouldn't have ended up in the hospital. But I wasn't trying to place blame, I was trying to find out what had happened and how to prevent it in the future. He was a total and complete jerk. I think the service is great and the hosts and servers here do a great job of handling a lot of customers when they're busy, but the manager should be fired. It wouldn't, however, prevent me from coming here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pleasanton?start=1140,3.52,3.5,3.416,2.7,3.5080000000000005

1016,Max-Adam A.,"San Leandro, CA",578,197,52.0,1.0,2012-01-25,"When you hear the name Cheesecake Factory, you immediately think of their cheesecake, right? Besides their signature cheesecakes, they also have other great desserts, drinks and food.   Moving on....Last Saturday, I experienced probably the WORST.CUSTOMER.SERVICE.EVER! We arrived and were told that the wait would be an hour.  Sure, no problem.  One hour is nothing...We got the name on the list, pager handed to us. We left for a little bit and came back...Went up to the podium and ask how much longer the wait would be, I was told 20 minutes.  As part of my routine, I look around to see who was there before me and who was there after me.  20 minutes had passed and all of a sudden I see other people who came after me being seated.  Wait, what? This isn't right.  Like anyone else would do, I'm going to question this.  I asked ""these people were seated before us and they came way after us"" ...here's what was said to me ""I'm sorry, there was a bit of a confusion.""  CONFUSION? People on a waiting list are put on a list and given a pager, what the heck was the confusion about? How can you mess that up? After another hour wait, we were finally seated.  But the poor service doesn't stop there.  After we ordered our food and it was given to us, we asked for Parmesan cheese.  I watched that waiter go to the waiter podium, talk to his co-workers for about 15 minutes and as soon as he was walking towards us, I flagged him down.  He looked at me and said ""oh, the Parmesan cheese"" ...said it as dull and unapologetic as he could.   A waitress came to our table after of few minutes of eating and asked if everything was ok.  I asked for 3 straws and here again, she walks away and wasn't seen for the next 10-15 minutes.  When she came back, she asked if everything was ok and I told her no.  Informed her that we're still waiting for the straws. She apologized and came back ....with dirty straws. Usually straws are wrapped up in their little paper holder, but these were not! ALL straws were dirty on BOTH ends!! What's going on here?! The manager on duty was informed by the waitress that we were having a horrible experience.  The manager came to our table and apologized for everything and the reasoning for it was because ""its been really busy.""  Regardless if you're busy or have 3 people in there, customer service needs to be top notch! Customer Service needs to be the focus! It really didn't seem like it was a focus at all.  I let her know the problems we had and the huge lack of customer service from her staff.  So her compensation to us, not that we were expecting one, was priority seating on our next visit.  How displeasing is that?  How can you even guarantee that?  So the next time we come in you're going to seat us before anyone else because of our bad customer service experience?  Do you realize that this will cost you other customers to be upset as well? Not only at your staff but at us for being seated before them.   I don't understand and don't know how this place in this specific city got soo bad.  We came here a lot, I came here with friends a lot. It's within driving distance but it seems like I will need to patronize other CF restaurants in other cities or just not even give them my business at all.  Very, very, very disappointed with this staff at this location...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pleasanton?start=1020,3.56,3.48,3.42,2.5640000000000005,3.5120000000000005

It took awhile just to get some water and quite a long time to get our orders taken. The food was decent. Our server helped put some things umder the table legs to make it stop moving around which was nice because we didn't ask for it.  One thing I didn't like is how my friend asked for some more cheese on his pasta after being asked how's everything going, but the server forgot about it.

954,Stephanie C.,"Alameda, CA",99,13,1.0,3.0,2012-02-17,"I met a friend for dinner at the Pleasonton, CA location on a Thursday night. It was my first time at this location.   The Pluses: The head Concierge man at the reservation desk gave us wonderful, kind service and promptly, very pleasantly escorted and seated us at the bar for a drink when we asked.  Although we were told there was a 30 min wait, it was only about 15 mins! (maybe that was due to going on a weeknight, later on, around 7:30pm...the initial dinner rush had ebbed off, but it was still quite busy). Appetizer:  Got the crab-artichoke dip...very tasty.  Crostini it was served with was also good.   Alcoholic Drinks:  Friend ordered a banana pina-colada kind of drink.  She said it was good, BUT it cost her $9! (and it wasn't that big of a drink).   The Critique i have is with the FOOD and the WAIT STAFF SERVICE:  While the staff were pleasant and responsive when we asked for something, I was displeased that no one came to check on us mid-meal to see if we needed something, or if our drinks needed to be re-filled....I needed to catch someone's attn and ask myself for a refill because my drink was empty.   Foodwise, the quality of ingredients was excellent, but the dish lacked flavor. I had the combo of Chicken Madiera and Steak Diane.  While the steak was a perfect med-rare, as i ordered, and tender w/o grisle or fat, the meat itself really lacked seasoning. If it weren't for the pan sauce that came with it, it would have been utterly bland...and even the pan sauce seemed to lack flavor or any richness, probably due to fast cooking time.  I wanted to ask for some A-1 or BBQ sauce, but the waiter never even came around to see how our meal was going, not until the end of the meal to see if we wanted a to-go box and some dessert.   Upcharges:   While i was very happy to be able to switch out the side of mashed potatos for pasta with no extra surcharge,  there was an extra charge for having marinara sauce on it....i wasn't going to pay an extra few bucks on top of an already $20 dinner entree (not so cheap to begin with), so just took the pasta as it came, with some butter and parmesean cheese. I added my own salt and pepper...again, pretty bland.    Dessert:  I ordered the ""White ChocolateTruffle Rasperry"" cheesecake w/ chocolate crust...it's one of the originals they've had forever. While good, it was not as dense or raspberry-ish as i remember from the past.   Friend ordered ordered the Red Velvet Cheesecake....That was SOOOOOO GOOOOD!..rich, dense, and not overly sweet, as cheesecake should be. The cake part was great too  I'll order that next time! Cheesecake factory is a nice and popluar place to eat, but for the price and reputation of restaurant (which is definately for more upscale budgets, or special occasions).

I mentioned the saltiness to the waitress when she brought our check, and she said if we had told her earlier she would have brought replacement fries.  Shame on me for not complaining sooner.   What prompted me to write this, my first Yelp review, was the condition of the doggie box.  I was not feeling well during the meal, so ate only half my sandwich and only one or two small forkfuls of a fairly good size green salad that came with the sandwich and was on the same plate.  I asked for my meal to be boxed up.  When I opened the box for a light dinner, only the sandwich was in the box.  What gives the restaurant the right to decide I did not want the rest of my uneaten meal boxed up.  That really annoyed me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pleasanton?start=1060,3.2,3.41,3.424,3.0800000000000005,3.326

797,Azn B.,"Oakland, CA",620,156,139.0,4.0,2012-07-13,"I've never been a big fan of Cheesecake Factory; their food is unimaginative, everything is overpriced, and for a place with ""Cheesecake"" in their name, their cheesecake is certainly not anything I would worship. Other than going to the SF one for views, other ones are usually a forced trip for birthdays and such. With that said, this Cheesecake Factory was actually tolerable, even... good?      This is not my first time at this particular TCF (I got lazy), but this was the first time I actually enjoyed it. After numerous trips to many of their chains, I have finally found a dish that I liked: - I ordered the Chicken Bellagio ($15). Pesto, basil pasta with roasted, crusted chicken topped with arugula and thinly sliced prosciutto. It also had hints of white sauce that I'm assuming is alfredo and, above all, topped with freshly grated parmesan. I gave my whole table some and they alll loved it! The portion was huge, enough to take half of it home (if I didn't give 1/4 of it away). Too bad it's almost 2000 calories by itself. Whyyyy...  - Red Velvet Cheesecake ($8). I've never liked their cheesecake, and this one wasn't any better. The cheesecake wasn't cheesy enough, a little too sweet for my taste. It's more reminiscent of frosting than cheesecake which completely bugs me. I also like it colder and this is semi-room temp. Not to mention how over priced it is just for a slice... - I also tried their Crab Bites and they're actually quite delicious. Mini balled up crab meat and perhaps jicama, lightly battered and fried. Very soft, tender, and flaky. Too bad I only had one :[ - Mini Crab Wontons ($10). I preferred the Crab bites, but these were not bad. They came with a lot, perfect for a big party.       The main reason why I'm giving this TCF 4 stars is because of their tremendous service. I usually don't care for service but they were exceptionally nice. They came back to check with our table in the perfect amount of times. They boxed our food. They respond with such politeness and grace to our needs. They even apologized when I ask them to send the cheesecake back because it came out right when I got my entree (I specifically asked for it at the end).

I said ""two for first available - my name"" she gave me a buzzer and looked at the person behind me. Not one word was exchanged and she looked so done with her job. Can't expect much more from some 16 year old. I walked just outside to wait and it never buzzed, but I saw someone who sat as far as the benches infront of PF changs get buzzed. We came in 30 minutes later and asked the status, and the same girl said ""you just have to wait"". We waited 15 more minutes in the lobby and asked the status, she said ""we called you already."" I said ""it never buzzed"" and she said ""ITS NOT MY FAULT YOU LEFT THE LOBBY - IT ONLY WORKS IN THE LOBBY."" I responded ""so you want about 50 people to stand in that 7 foot square area by the door?"" Awful. We really thought that she was menstruating and the rest of the service would be cheesecake factory style service.

I've been to this place twice.  Once for take out and the other with 4 friends.  My friends and I venture into the cheesecake factory once in a while.  It's pretty much the same everywhere.  Good food, hit or miss service at best.  The prices are ok; not great, not bad.  But the prices for the cheesecakes are outrageous.   A regular plain 10 inch cheesecake is $42.  A 10 inch flavored cheesecake is $46-52.  Not cheap.  They also are extremely sugary.  I'm not a huge cheesecake fan but many people I know like it, but they will only buy it by the slice when they eat.  Extremely sweet.  Anyways, one time I went I had the Bacon cheeseburger and the other a  single pepperoni pizza.  Burger was great; fries were classic.  Crispy on the outside, not cooked on the inside.  I still don't get why some restaurants serve thick fries when they don't cook them right.  Pizza was great.  Other friends had 2 pasta dishes that they liked.  The server was ok but obviously busy.  Try to avoid busy times because you can wait a long time to get your food.  When I went there the second time I had a take out order.  I had a guinness at the bar and it took forever (30 minutes).  I was in a rush and got the bad and took off.  I didn't check the bag until I got home and of course they forgot my cheesecake. lol  omg.   I emailed the website and told them what happened and they sent me a $10 gift card which was very nice of them.  Pro's: -good, solid food -good bar selection Cons:  -Service is hit or miss.  Avoid busy times like after work. -popular cheesecake (but expensive if you buy a whole one)  It is what it is.  A national chain that serves pretty good food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pleasanton?start=860,3.6,3.43,3.496,2.8240000000000003,3.498
1082,Joanne B.,"Castro Valley, CA",1,74,1.0,2.0,2012-09-19,"Took my daughter here for a pre-back to school lunch. This place came HIGHLY recommended. Went during lunchtime which was obviously a mistake. The patrons were talking SO loud, I couldn't hear my daughter. We literally had to yell to each other across the little table. Seemed to be a lot of obnoxious business people. C'mon people, where are your manners! It was like being in an elementary school cafeteria. All we needed was a tray of food being spilled and a food fight, and I'd be in 2nd grade again. Wait staff was pleasant but quite overworked. Because we'd never been here before, we wanted to look at the menu for a few minutes - which turned into a half hour because our waiter was so busy, he couldn't get back to us. Daughter wanted some kind of veggie burger, to which the waiter said, ""I wouldn't recommend it"". Okay - I don't see the point in offering things that aren't recommended. My daughter is a vegetarian and had a difficult time finding an item to begin with. The noise level was so incredibly loud - couple that with having to wait so long to give an order....we decided to leave. Manager came over and tried to make us happy, but I couldn't hear half of what she was saying. After saying four times that we just wanted to leave, we finally had to just get up....and leave. Decor was beautiful, but the atmosphere was destroyed by the noise level. For the prices they charge, I would expect a more demeanor crowd. I don't want to pay $11 for a burger but have more noise than being at an A's game. They need to hire more lunchtime staff. Those folks were stressed to keep up and give people the attention they needed. Highly recommended, but highly overrated.

627,Kari C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",330,665,1115.0,4.0,2012-09-23,"Not bad at all. We were intrigued about Cheesecake Factory after reading about their restaurant operations in an article by Atul Gawande, surgeon and author. Food is about 3.5 stars and service was excellent. It was a busy Sunday lunch, but we were given a buzzer and were seated in about 10 minutes, exactly as promised. Me and DH only got water, but their selection of alcoholic & non-alcoholic beverages was vast. They brought warm, fresh bread over and it was delicious! Cold butter too! Such a nice surprise. There was a soft, chewy, mild sourdough and a dark wheat bread with a hint of sweetness, topped with oat flakes. DH really liked the dark bread, even though he's not a carb-lover like I am. I got a lunch sized portion of the famous Miso Salmon, plated on brown rice, and served with snow peas. Everything was fresh and the rice was softer and fluffier than I anticipated. Sauce was sweet and teriyaki-like. There were a few dabs of a creamy sauce. It all went well together. Snow peas were fresh, but had some fibrous bits. Salmon was fully cooked, a lot more done than I would have liked, but I learned from the server that I could have ordered it rare. There wasn't a trace of fishiness at all. Portion size for lunch is still bigger than what a normal person could eat! DH got the crab scramble with hash browns. I tried a bite and thought it was bland. I couldn't taste any crab in it. Hash browns seemed a bit undercooked in the middle and there wasn't enough ""browning"" for my liking. I think it was just undersalted. DH's portion was massive, covering an entire dinner-sized plate. He took about 1/2 of it home. Prices for dessert aren't cheap, but portions are also large. We got the tiramisu for $7.50, DH's favorite, which was surprisingly good! The flavors of chocolate, almond, and coffee were perfectly balanced. I would have preferred deeper chocolate notes, but that's my own bias towards dark chocolate. It had a nice amount of creaminess and the ladyfingers were not overly soggy. There was a massive amount of whipped cream, but we didn't eat all of that.  DH thought it wasn't a good deal, but overall, a pretty good experience. It is kind of loud inside, not really too romantic. A lot of people brought their kids. Definitely better quality food than other places that are kid-friendly, such as Carrow's or Denny's. One other gripe: some of our silverware was not completely clean. They had bits of leftover food stuck between the tines. We didn't ask to have them replaced, but I'm sure that they would have done so.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pleasanton?start=640,3.52,3.43,3.492,3.088,3.466

For dessert, I was persuaded by our server to order the white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake. It was only OK. The mac nut ended up tasting and crunching on the stale side which really ruined it for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pleasanton?start=820,3.32,3.47,3.456,2.732,3.41
953,Genevieve H.,"Fremont, CA",3,5,5.0,3.0,2013-02-01,"*3.5 Stars* This was my first time going to the Cheesecake Factory, and it definitely wasn't bad. It wasn't superb -- maybe I'd been looking forward to visiting it for so long that I hyped it up in my mind so much that I found myself not feeling, well, blown away. We came Saturday evening, and because the place is so popular, they'd said they wouldn't be able to take reservations, which is reasonable. We came around 7-ish, and the lady at the front said the wait was going to be about 1.5 hours. Admittedly, it's a long time, but we just spent the time at the Macy's nearby and were called in 1 hour later (guess they overestimate a little, which is fair).  Here's what we ordered: Starter: Sweet Corn Fritters. I wasn't sure what I was expecting, but it was pretty good! They're generously-sized chunks of fried sweet corn in some kind of batter. Sweet, savoury, and crunchy. Main:  Cajun Burger w/ Sweet Potato Fries: -- Pretty good! Mind you, this burger is pretty hot (as in fresh off the grill, not spicy). Glamburgers such as this one are served with fries or (something else, I forget). Regular fries are free, sweet potato fries are an extra dollar. The bun is grilled to perfection, and I loved how the grilled onions and bell peppers complemented the rest of the burger so well. One tip: let it cool down slightly before biting in, or at least use a napkin to hold the burger. The juices are really hot and scalded my fingers when I bit into it :) Evelyn's Favorite Pasta -- I'm a little iffy on this one. The pasta itself is pretty good -- the oven-baked tomatoes added a lot of flavor to the pasta, along with the broccoli and everything else. This is my one complaint: when it was served to us, it tasted stiff and rubbery. The waitress told us it was cooked to al dente, which I understand means firm...but it was still rubbery. We ended up taking it home and steaming it before polishing it off.  Steak Diane -- We ate it medium-rare, and it was just like a steak's supposed to be, with a lovely pink center. Even my dad, who likes going to American restaurants, complimented it. Despite that, I didn't feel like the steak was...special. Good, but not special. It also came with mashed potatoes (with skins and chunks), which were delicious. I'm a potato fan. Bang-Bang Chicken & Shrimp -- Hm, this one didn't really leave much of an impression. It's a Thai-inspired dish that looks like a plateau of rice in a pool orange curry. I did try it last, and I was really full by then, so take this comment with a grain of salt.  Dessert: Tiramisu Cheesecake: Wow. It's tiramisu...but it's also cheesecake. It was sweet and indulgent without being too heavy. We polished this one off quite quickly! In all, it was a decent first experience. It did come out to be pricey (but then again, it's the Cheesecake Factory), but it was a fun experience! Will try again sometime, but maybe during a less-crowded hour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pleasanton?start=960,3.36,3.47,3.452,2.7640000000000002,3.426

This particular Cheesecake Factory is always packed (Every time I've come, I've had to wait anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour), and they don't always take reservations. The service here is almost always crappy. I've only had one decent waitress. The rest have forgotten orders, been overly 'polite' by constantly interrupting to see if we were enjoying our meal, or just been straight up rude. Being really dimly lit, having noisy pop music no one can hear over everyone's loud conversations, and being able to hear all the noise from the kitchen make for an unpleasant atmosphere. The decor of bright, fancy-looking foreign art (I don't know how else to describe it) tries to fool you into thinking that it's some upscale restaurant, but it's just a franchise that's really nothing more than a glorified/more expensive Applebee's.  The only reason this place is getting three stars is because their food is really good and their overpriced cheesecake is delicious.

I think I've only been here a handful of times and most of it was to get their cheesecakes, which NEVER failed me.  I came here the other night for dinner. I ordered the Jambalaya pasta, their most popular pasta dish. My friend also recommended it to me because she had tried it before and said it was actually pretty good. My pasta came out and the first thing I noticed was the heaping tower of noodles and the LACK of sauce. It was soooo dry! It also came with chicken and shrimp. The chicken was moist, but flavorless. The shrimp (the few I found), was decent. I was not satisfied with this dish at all! Towards the end, our waitress came by to check up on us. I told her about my pasta and she got the manager. The manager quickly came and I told him about my dissatisfaction with my dish. He told me that it's common to have the noodles absorb the sauce because they give about 7oz of noodles. Yes, I do know noodles absorb sauce, but come on now, unless my dish has been sitting in the kitchen for a while, it shouldn't absorb that quickly! My dish was so sauce-less that it wasn't even glistening when it came out. It was seriously so BLAND. The manager was nice about it and did ask if I wanted to replace it. I was full, so I declined. He ended up taking my dish off the bill, though.

1407,Jennifer P.,"Castro Valley, CA",0,2,,1.0,2013-03-01,"I went to Cheesecake for lunch.  My salad came out before my meal.  I immediately discovered a lettuce bug the size of a dime-with-legs on my salad and ready to eat it. I gasped loudly at seeing this healthy crawling bug on my food as well as the mere size of it. The waiter took my salad away and a manager immediately came over.  She apologized and told me and my coworker that our meals would be complimentary.  Here's the kicker.  She then continued to say that this type of bug was ""common"" to be found on lettuce and that they tend to stick to lettuce and are hard to see.  I guess she thought this information justified a bug sitting on my plate. I was so appalled by her comment and it made me even more sick to my stomach.  Needless to say, after staring at our meal for a minute or so, we left the restaurant with our food untouched. The manager just let us go and did not offer for us to come back and dine again on the house.  That is the least she could have done.  So here are my thoughts that will stick in my mind after this experience at the Cheesecake Factory: 1) Lettuce bugs are commonly found in their lettuce, 2) they definitely do not wash their lettuce thoroughly and check for these common bugs, 3) the kitchen is probably not very clean, and 4) their management staff does not have a clue on properly handling a very unpleasant customer experience.  I do not recommend the Cheesecake factory if you are looking for a good, clean, BUG-FREE dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pleasanton?start=1380,3.08,3.38,3.428,2.724,3.2600000000000007

I had a cup (really a bowl) of Clam Chowder to start with and except for being slightly thicker than I like, it was pretty good - good clam flavor and a nice flavor for the soup part.  Then we had Crab Cakes and these were excellent.  They had lots of crab meat and not much filler and the exterior had a nice crispy crust - good flavor and good textures. I had the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta with chicken and shrimp.  The pasta was al dente linguine and the sauce was very nice - slightly spicy but nicely balanced and lots of the chicken and shrimp.  The chicken was all white meat but it was moist and flavorful. My wife had the fish tacos and she had a choice of grilled or deep fried.  She chose the grilled and she thought they were very good - good enough that she would order them, again. We finished with a shared Reese's Peanut Butter Cheesecake.  It is a large slice so we ended up taking home more than half of my pasta and about half lf the cheesecake..  Yup, large portions is pretty much a standard thing, here.

726,Michelle J.,"Oakland, CA",158,41,8.0,2.0,2013-07-28,"I love Cheesecake Factory. Really, I do. I just REALLY REALLY REALLY dislike this location. That being said it gets 2 stars because the cheesecake/food is still on point and the manager (?) at this location on 7/27 was the business, but everything else was meh or worse. First - got there Saturday night about 5:15. Normally, when I go to the Cheesecake Factory in Walnut Creek (run from Pleasanton to WC, trust me) at that time I am seated almost immediately. At this location though, our party of 4 had to wait. We were told it wouod be about 20 minutes. It was me, the hubs, our 5 year old and our 1 year old (and all of us were starving). It was not 20 minutes. It was 30+ minutes. I think the fact we had to wait so long (and had to wait at all) is because this location is TINY. The sign said capacity of 360-ish, but compared to all other Cheesecake Factories I''ve been to (at least 4 others), this one was definitely the smallest by far. When we were finally seated we were told that they did not have a high chair for my one year old. They only have 5 in the whole restaurant. Really? A big company like CF only has 5 high chairs in the restaurant. I have literally been to mom and pop hole in wall types places with more than 5 high chairs in the restaurant. The woman who seated us was not particularly helpful or apologetic about it either. If you've ever tried to eat out with an infant and no high chair, it is next to impossible.  When our waiter came to the table we told him about the high chair situation and he was not all that helpful either. It was so bad my husband planned to get up and scout out a high chair after we had our orders taken. AND our waiter clearly did not care about us. He kept saying, ""I'll be with you in a minute"" in favor of talking to other tables. Maybe he figured since we had kids we would not be getting liquored up (true) or ordering super expensive meals (also true), but that does not excuse bad service. After our order was taken a manager walked by and my husband flagged him down. We explained the high chair situation and the manager, who showed genuine concern for our situation said he'd be back. About 5 minutes later he showed up with a high chair. Thank the lord we saw him and he helped us out. If we left it up to the hostess or the waiter my son would have sat in our laps while we ate dinner. My husband actually saw them pushing out high chairs from a storage room so it was clear they actually had more than 5 high chairs but someone was too lazy to ask where they were (thanks for nothing hostess and waiter).  Aside from this high chair debacle and the lame waiter everything else was fine. I just know I will NEVER EVER EVER EVER eat at this location again. I would definitely get cheesecake to go, but if I want to eat at the Cheesecake Factory it will not be this location. Go to Walnut Creek, SF or San Mateo.

1186,Jericho L.,"Dublin, CA",131,5,,5.0,2013-10-24,"Though I do not eat at cheesecake factory much, from my experiences there those few times, I must say it does take the cheesecake. (Get it?)  Let's separate this into parts as to why I think it deserves a 5 star rating.  Wait time: Depending on the day and time that you go your wait time can range from 1 minute to maybe an hour or so. *Sundays are the worse cause that is everyone's off day. I personally enjoy going on slow days like Tuesday, especially since its much quieter and easier to talk without the russel and bussel in the background*  Service: I think all their waiters are amazing, and so patient. Each time they pass by there is always a smile (a genuine one at that) and they are pretty quick with attending to your needs. I do not recall a time I had to reask/repeat myself on what I needed, even on them busy sundays the workers are on top of their service.  Menu: I usually go for their pastas, but from the looks of it they have a good variety for whatever you're craving for. My father orders steak often, he can be picky with how well the meat was prepped but from seeing that he literally scarfs it down in just a few minutes goes to show that he enjoys them steaks.  *Side note: I do enjoy they personally grain pepper for you, adds to the ambiance.*  Cost: I myself go only on paycheck day, or when there is a special reason to be there. I have not just randomly decided to go to Cheescake factory 'just because'. It may be pricier for me, but with everything listed above you feel as if you get your money's worth.  Desert: I decided to put desert as its own separate category. Mainly cause, well its cheesecake factory and this is what they're known for. The amount of variety in their deserts is unreal and very impressive. It get anxious just thinking about it. They basically have so much variety that everyone can get their own specific one and no one would get the same order (well for my family)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pleasanton?start=800,2.8,3.11,3.336,2.868,2.9859999999999998

The portions have gotten slightly smaller in the last couple of years. Where the patty once used to cover the bottom half of a brioche bun, it now covers about two-thirds. Plus, the patties are flatter. The factory burritos favored by the kid has more rice than before.  And, at this location, they now nickel-and-dime you for the side dishes. The other night we wanted to swap a side of xx with a veggie for the fish taco order. We were given a choice of carrots, broccoli, or asparagus. When the bill came, we noticed an extra charge added for choosing asparagus (all short and scrawny 4 stalks of it). The San Francisco TCF did not charge for asparagus, at least not 2 weeks ago. When something is gonna cost extra, let's be upfront about it, okay? Then we can make an informed decision about swapping out a side that COMES WITH the meal. I hate to niggle on this nominal charge, but I did.  TCF used to be inviting and generous with their food.

491,Kim R.,"Pleasanton, CA",59,67,161.0,2.0,2013-11-26,"I've continued to eat at The Cheesecake Factory since I became gluten-free seven  years ago. I have found that if I stick to fairly simple meals (plain salmon, brown rice and steamed veggies), most restaurants can handle it (most....is the key word). I have never once became sick at the Cheesecake Factory after eating the plain salmon meal. So, I was very intrigued when I saw that they now have an official gluten-free menu. Needless to say, I rushed over. How exciting! It's a totally independent menu. Nice! There were many of their older dishes on this new GF menu which must have been naturally gluten-free to begin with. The new items that jumped out at me were the gluten-free hamburger buns and gluten-free pasta. Of course, I had a bunch of questions to ask. I've listed them below with my waiter's response. Do you use dedicated oil for the French fries listed on your gluten-free menu? No. I then went on to ask why they would go through the effort of introducing this menu without doing it correctly. Despite my attack on their procedure, he was very nice and was eager to learn and help me. Do you use dedicated water for your GF pasta? Yes (continue reading for the real deal on this). What is the flour blend for the pasta? I don't know but I will bring you the package. It turns out is Heartland brand which is a rice and corn blend. What is the brand of your GF hamburger buns? I'm not sure but I'll check....(later) It's Udi's. Are your salad dressing gluten-free? Most of them (so please ask when ordering). Do you use GF blue cheese? (The manager came over to answer this one)...Yes. Do you have GF beer? No, but we do have Angry Orchard Hard Cider (YUM) I notice your Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake is gluten-free. Has it always been gluten-free? No...we were told it was in the past but then we discovered there was gluten (wheat flour) in the crust (SCARY). It has now been revamped to be gluten-free. I decided to try something new to me so I ordered the pear and candied pecan salad with goat cheese (below). This has been on the original menu for some time. Much to my dismay when I got home and served Sammy some pasta, look what I found (see photo I have included)...I have to assume this is a wheat flour noodle since they mentioned nothing of a second type of GF pasta. Since they told me they use dedicated GF pasta water, I am assuming this came from a shared colander or they do not indeed use dedicated water...either way, this was a serious mistake. I absolutely would not consider the GF pasta here at The Cheesecake Factory a ""celiac friendly"" meal or for anyone else eating GF for that matter. It also makes me wonder about their other GF procedures as well. Of course, I had to try the GF Godiva chocolate cheesecake for dessert even though it has dairy. I had only a few bites (scrapping away the whipped cream) and it was chocolate heaven...cheesecake is something they do well. Will I be back? Yes, on occasion I will go back when my older kids want to go. I will order my usual, plain salmon with brown rice and veggies. I will have Sammy order the hamburger since there are probably fewer ways to mess that up. So for me, nothing has changed at The Cheesecake Factory. For Sammy, well, now he gets to have a bun with his hamburger. It's really not a big thrill for him since he's been raised since two years old to just eat the meat of the hamburger. I'm sad that yet another major restaurant chain has jumped on the gluten-free bandwagon without doing their research and training both the kitchen and wait staff properly. I'm hoping there will be enough complaints that they will correct this.

They have a huge array of items on the menu that will for sure please any palette. Plus, their cheesecakes really are that good! This place was packed by the time we got there (6:30). We ordered some kind of spicy thai wrap for an app, I got the cajun pasta and my friend got the shrimp scampi. O-EM-GEE!! I have never gotten that thai wrap before and it is that flippin good! The sauce has a little kick, just enough to waken the senses in your mouth. The red cabbage is drenched in the sauce and can be eaten as a little side salad. The wrap remained crunchy even with the sauce all over it, I absolutely hate when things that are meant to be crispy come our soggy. The cajun pasta was different from what I normally order. There was a good amount of depth in flavors and the portion was too big for me to finish. I really like that they don't skimp on the meat and shrimp and the shrimp are the jumbo prawns not the cheapy kind. I normally order the shrimp scampi and it came out just as good that night. I love the complimentary bread! Especially the wheat bread, at least I think it is wheat bread... We stayed there pretty long time and the waitress didn't rush us out. She was very nice and atentative. Of course I finished off the meal with the staple cheesecake and loved every bite of it!

It was really crowded, and the girl at the counter told me that it will be a 1 hour wait. I looked at my daughter and she said we will wait. I was given token # 69. The time was about 7:30 PM. Here I am standing waiting for my turn, watching people come and go by taking their tokens and waiting for their turn to come just like me. After some time I had a feeling that people that had shown up after me were being called. I told this to my daughter and she did not care as long as she got to eat here. After about 30 minutes a family came in took the token and stood next me. But 20 minutes later they were called and not us. Now my daughter saw this and asked me to enquire at the counter. We were told that we have to wait another 10 mins for our turn. When I asked how come poeple who came after me are being called, she told me that, this should not happen and has no clue why it is. After another 15 minutes when I again went to the counter I was told that I am the next in the waiting list. My daughter was so happy now eagerly waiting for our turn. A few minutes later we were called. When I went to the counter, another girl whispered in her ear that it is not their turn but the turn of another 2 guys who had shown up at the place about 15 minitures back!  I told them this and all I got as an answer was that I will be next. By now I was at my wits end and asked to speak to their manager. The manager had nothing more to say except that we were next. Instead she wasked me to tell her why I thought that people had been called before their turn. All I told her was to look at her logs and find that out. She had no answer. Long story short, I convinced my daughter to go to ""On the Borders"" at Hacienda Crossings and it turned out to be awesome. Myy daughter being the happiest girl in town after having her dinner and desert.

Drinks: Chardonnay and a strawberry daiquiri Kids lemonades in kid cups. All were good. Appetizer: Hot crab dip: cream cheese with crab shreds and artichoke with some tomato flavor. The crispy buttery bread served with it was great. I wouldn't order it again though. Good but not that good. Food: Kids mac and cheese-elbow macaroni in a kraft-type cheese sauce. Very basic. The pasta was al dente and the kids didn't eat much. Kids pizza- I did not like the cheese. The crust was thin with nice edges. Chicken romanesco- 3 pieces of flat chicken covered with Parmesan and panko, fried to a golden crisp topped w a light lemon cream sauce. Served with yummy mashed potatoes and asparagus.($18) Shrimp with angel hair pasta- lots of tomatoes. That's what the server advised and it was true. The pasta was overdone and it only had 5 pieces of shrimp. The tomatoes were bland. I had to add salt. I wish they offered me Parmesan. Not worth it. ($18) Dessert: Lemoncello torte to go: this dessert is so good. It looks like tiramisu, has a crunchy topping like an apple crisp, creamy, lemony, with a side of strawberries.

The Salad was wilted & Pasta was terrible, lacking shrimp, flavor and ingredients.

Sadly the manager couldn't have cared less about his job or Cheesecake Factorys Customer.

369,Christina L.,"Winston-Salem, NC",293,518,1894.0,5.0,2013-12-27,"No surprise to find me at a desserts place celebrating my birthday, right? I ordered the Chicken Bellagio - crispy coated chicken breast over basil pasta and parmesan cream sauce, topped with prosciutto and arugula salad. The chicken (2 patties) was impressively tender and delicious. The crust was perfectly light and thin, just enough to add a little crunch to the chicken. I would have liked to have more of the prosciutto, rather than a couple thin slices. Hot chocolate looked amazing when it arrived at my table, but of course, I still need a REAL dessert. Now that it's in season again, I just HAD to order the Peppermint Bark Cheesecake - white chocolate cheesecake swirled with chunks of chocolate peppermint bark, topped with white chocolate mousse, finished with chopped peppermint (available for the fall/winter holidays). Refreshing and beautiful, this cheesecake was presented on a plate that said ""Happy Birthday to You"" (in chocolate syrup). Looks and tastes incredible, even though I don't usually like/eat peppermint. Definitely glad I tried it! It was so crowded (due to everyone being on winter break for the holidays) that my group decided to sit outside (shorter wait period). However, at one point, the sunny sky suddenly turned overcast and it began sprinkling! Great. The waiters put up umbrellas, but not enough to ensure everyone was covered. Luckily, I was! Also, the waiters huddled around me to sing happy birthday, after announcing it was my 21st birthday, which it definitely was NOT (though I'm sure they all thought I was still in high school - for all you Asians out there, I'm sure you understand).

291,Maggie X.,"Phoenix, AZ",121,384,4865.0,3.0,2013-12-28,"I've had some of my worst dining experiences at Cheesecake Factories, but this time was surprisingly an exception. I still don't get the hype for this place (especially the location in San Francisco), but I do like this location enough to venture back for lunch - although only for lunch.  I like the decor of this restaurant in general; it's a nice and intimate setting with dim lights and both table and booth seating. What usually distracts from enjoying a dining experience here are the outrageously long lines (I've waited up to four hours for a table of three before) and lackluster wait staff.  This time though, my mom and I came for lunch within half an hour of opening. There was no wait, and we were seated at a corner table. Our waiter, Dave M., was incredibly thoughtful and attentive, even going so far as to offer a sample of the soup of the day when I wasn't sure what butterbean was.  Complimentary molasses and sourdough bread: ( ) Each meal is prefaced with a basket of molasses and sourdough bread, and I much prefer the former to the latter. It's pretty good bread, soft and spongy on the inside and crispy on the outside. It also comes with butter on the side.  Renee's lunch special with garden salad, half a turkey sandwich, and butterbean soup: ( ) The garden salad came with mixed greens and roma tomatoes. They were fresh, although the tomato pieces were cut quite large. The turkey sandwich had a good amount of sliced turkey and was quite tasty, although a little dry. The butterbean soup was delicious; it was made with bacon, butter beans, and kale. It was a little salty, but the flavor was really good.  Renee's lunch special with butterbean soup, half a chicken salad sandwich, and fries instead of salad: ( ) My mom opted for the chicken salad sandwich, and it came on toasted bread slices with chicken salad tossed with mayonnaise and lettuce inside. I had a bite of this, and it was a little too heavy for my taste. The chicken pieces were a little sparse, and the lettuce was weighed down by the heavy sauce. Instead of getting salad, my mom got fries, which were pretty standard. They were cut a little bit thicker than fast food fries, although not thick enough to be steak fries.  I think the lunch specials are a pretty good deal, and I'd come again at lunchtime when the wait isn't as long.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pleasanton?start=340,3.04,3.03,3.288,2.9880000000000004,3.034

Most of their dishes are high in calories, so I appreciate that they have a ""skinny"" menu for those watching their intake. Their Pasta Da Vinci and Chicken Madeira was really good, if you don't like creamy sauces like me. I also liked their Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad. They have a separate menu for brunch items.

962,Sarah C.,"Rohnert Park, CA",136,35,2.0,2.0,2014-02-13,"This is now the third Cheesecake Factory I have been to and it's safe to say it was the worst. I'm not expecting 5 star service or food from here, but I do expected to be treated a certain way.  We arrived here on a Saturday night at 7:35, fully aware that we would be expecting a bit of a wait. We signed in with a young man named Gabe and were told it would be a 50 minute wait. This restaurant is connected to a mall so we went and dilly dallied about for about 40 minutes. We arrived back at the restaurant at 8:10 and my boyfriend went and checked to see what the time frame was. That is when Gabe informed him that we'd only been waiting fifteen minutes and that we still had another 30 minutes til it was our turn. Before my boyfriend could respond, Gabe turned away and gave his attention to someone else. He and I agreed to wait 8:35 (an hour after our original sign in) and then go somewhere else. At 8:35, I went up and asked when we would be seated considering we'd been waiting an hour when we were originally told 50 minutes. The nice young lady whose name I did not catch asked my name again and then got a higher employee (I believe, not confirmed) because they could not find our name. They both searched and then admitted it seemed we had been taken off the list. The higher employee immediately apologized, found a table for us, apologized again and had us seated. I informed her of Gabe's actions and thanked her for her response to the problem. The rest of the meal went fine, our waitress wasn't the most on top of things but I could tell her section was quite busy.  I would be willing to come here again but I would frequently check in to make sure I somehow didn't get off the list. Being someone who has worked in customer service and with wait lists, I know it can be crazy but what happened to us was just unacceptable. Very pleased with the two female hostesses who showed class and extreme competency at their job.

701,Nick V.,"San Ramon, CA",224,81,2.0,3.0,2014-02-13,"I've been to this location several times, mostly because of the proximity to my house. I don't order a whole wide variety of stuff, but generally the food is cooked pretty well. There have been occasions where the pasta I have gotten wasn't seasoned properly, but no complaints about food other than that. The portions are good for the value.  Drinks are another thing though. The fountain drinks are fountain drinks, not much you can say about that. The lemonade is like a touch (or several touches) too sweet. Most of the drinks I've ordered from the bar were on the strong side, not that I'm complaining, but it's nice to have that balance...especially for those who don't enjoy a heavy-alcohol taste.  Not much to say in the decor department since all locations are pretty much the same. This place can get pretty loud and echo-y because of the tile floors and the deep ceilings. I would avoid this place during peak lunch/dinner hours, you could be waiting for 30+ minutes just to get a table. With the mall being next door, you could probably kill some time during the long wait, but I doubt the buzzer would work from all the way inside the mall.  I usually end up spending $15-20 to eat here.

924,Ken T.,"Berkeley, CA",111,63,384.0,4.0,2014-02-15,"On Saturday afternoon, I came with a friend to the Stoneridge mall to do some shopping. At 2 PM, we decided to get lunch at the Cheesecake Factory hoping that the wait wouldn't be too long then. However, they told us that the wait was for 40 min. Well, we were slightly bummed but it wasn't too bad. They gave us the little electronic device and we just went back and shopped some more. We came back after 40 minutes or so and the device started flashing! It was very nice that 40 min actually meant 40 min.  We were seated promptly and the waitress came quickly and offered us bread and drinks. We ordered the peach smoothie, which was pretty good! It had a really fresh flavor but was on the sweet side. I ordered the spicy crispy chicken sandwich with fries. It also came with a chipotle mayo sauce (or buffalo if you prefer that) which I thought was nice. The chicken certainly was very crispy. It looked like it had been fried for a bit too long though but still tasted really good. The spice was great. It was definitely there but not too spicy at all. It came with a nice piece of melted cheese on the top and lettuce and a tomato on the side. The lettuce was shredded, which is kind of weird to me to leave on the side...since it was pretty hard to get on the sandwich since it just kept falling out. In addition, the lettuce wasn't very fresh and tasted kind of bitter (and without the nice crisp of fresh lettuce). Other than that, the sandwich was pretty good. The fries were pretty standard. My friend ordered the Bistro Shrimp Pasta and thought it was pretty decent. The pasta and the sauce tasted nice but the sauce was a bit greasy. The shrimp was cooked well and tasted fresh. The serving portions of both dishes were both fairly large and along with the bread, we left very full (without room for dessert unfortunately). The good thing was that it was easy to walk by and get a piece of cheesecake to go! Overall, I would say it was a decent experience. The food is pretty good and the service was nice. The waitress was very energetic and checked up on us frequently to make sure that we were okay. I wish the food was more, well healthier, but I guess that's what you get for going to the Cheesecake Factory!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pleasanton?start=940,3.44,3.06,3.248,3.3120000000000003,3.2120000000000006

I've been to those ones a lot compared to probably any other restaurant in the past two years few years. When I walked inside the layout was slightly different which I guess is the norm for the Cheesecake Factory it has a slightly different layout however the same look the same materials were used in making the inside and outside probably. Oh I guess I'll also been to the Palo Alto Cheesecake Factory 2 times. This Cheesecake Factory hss dim lighting than usual it seemed, but I guess that adds to the romantic ambience of the restaurant.  So we got there late about 10:30 p.m. on a weekday. It was definitely not busy I assume that this Cheesecake Factory is probably not that busy during nights as compared to the first two locations I listed. We were seated right away the hostess was nice, and the waiter came shortly after I took our order, he was nice. I would have liked it if he would have cleared the dishes of the table more quicker but other than that he was actually helpful. I had ordered a Moroccan Chicken plate and I really like the sauce and so he actually was willing to you get more sauce to-go and he went and got more sauce and he ended up giving me a lot extra than I would have wanted or needed, but I like that sauce. When my boyfriend asked what would be a good dish to order he recommended on the the Jambalaya Pasta which was pretty good, and I tried both, I had had the Moroccan Chicken before, one that I guess I seem to order pretty regularly. I've noticed in the last few years that the size of the dishes at Cheesecake Factory's have become slightly smaller but however still quite large portions are usually about 2-3 portions per plate. My guy finished his whole plate, but I still feel like it was a good size portion. The Jambalaya Pasta was supposed to be maybe one of the spiciest or hottest  pasta according to the waiter and my guy asked for more red pepper, but for me it was definitely a spicy enough. For dessert we ordered a white chocolate raspberry cheesecake which was delicious, too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pleasanton?start=680,3.44,3.1,3.26,3.3440000000000003,3.2360000000000007

They have Sunday brunch and of which Giant Belgian Waffle sounds very attractive but I insist  So we had a Mango Key Lime Cheesecake. It was a good choice, the cheese is a bit sweet and the mango and lime are perfect to even it out. Maybe a bit less tart will be better, but it's much better than the red velvet.

Also, the woman on the phone said we'd only have to wait 30 minutes at a certain time... #trustbroken. The good thing about this place is that the manager is really nice (the African American man) and he really does mean it when he says, ""I'll try to do something about it."" The waiters are really nice too: friendly, energetic, and happy. The food however... let's just say the pasta is hard and should be cooked more, and my mom makes better rice, but maybe that's because she's Filipino... but still. They messed up on my order when I got the Teriyaki Chicken, but I didn't want to complain because I'm a waiter too and I hate it when the order gets messed up because we feel like it's our fault even though it isn't. The cheesecakes are really good, though. The only thing is that they're too sweet, but the presentation is excellent! They should just stick to cheesecakes in my opinion.  My final tip?

Back then I loved it, but quickly became tired of always going there. I hadn't been there in a long time (like 5 or 6 years), until we got a gift card for here. Along with the gift card was a gift card for a free slice of cheesecake. So, my hubby and I came here for lunch this past weekend. It was like I remembered it. Their menu is way too long and they have the most unhealthy foods of all time. I just don't like that. I get it. It's a restaurant in America, so of course, it's going to be unhealthy. But with the amount of stuff on their menu and the horrible nutritional facts for ALL the foods, it just makes this place seem like a lie to me. Don't let their Skinny menu fool you. Its low in calories and high in sodium and sugar. You just can't win. Definitely not the place to go to when you want to eat healthy....but alas, we have the gift card. I ended up getting the lunch portion of the tomato and basil pizza and a side salad with balsamic. The hubby got some shrimp appetizer and the club sandwich with fries. He also ordered a drink from the bar that took forever to arrive. The excuse was that there was only one bartender. Here's an idea!...have two bartenders during the weekend when it's busier for most businesses. Overall, everything was mediocre. However, their namesake did not disappoint.

Fresh Baked Flatbread~ The fresh basil, tomato and cheese with mozzarella, fontina and parmesan cheeses. It was super light. I would probably wouldn't get this again unless I was coming in for dessert only and needed a little something before I dug into my dessert.  Roadside Sliders which were bite-sized burgers on mini-buns served with grilled onions, pickles and ketchup. These were pretty good. Perfect for a Snack.  Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes topped with sour cream, salsa, avocado and salsa verde.These were super delish,  I loved the sweetness and all the extras to top it off.  Then for dessert I had the Toasted Marshmallow S'mores Galore Cheesecake which was Hershey's® Cheesecake topped with chocolate ganache, finished with toasted house made marshmallow, Honey Maid graham crackers and whipped cream.

Sat down served a little too fast didn't get a minute to check the drink menu. Our server was nice but she seriously needs a GPS as she disappeared A LOT. She managed to get our drinks to us and get the bill/tip that was about it. She served our appetizer and quickly disappeared. I guess she expected us to lap it up off the table as we were not given small plates other than the bread plates already on the table, after trying to locate a server, we just stole tiny plates from an empty table, thanks. Someone else brought our main dish. Another server finally came over and served us dessert which we couldn't finish, where he failed when we asked to get our desserts to go, upon getting home and opening the boxes later that night the desserts had just been dumped in and looked like cheesecake and tiramisu mush. This would have been a great review if the staff were taught cs is not just a smile and being friendly, it's about following through and completing the customer process from start to finish, would also be great if staff were taught how presentation is key.

John the bartender was super nice and helpful.  Told me about some of the drinks he was making that looked fabulous. I tried the pineapple mojito, and wow! Was it delicious! Service: We ordered our food and were squished because a lady had stuck an extra chair at the bar. During our entire visit, her wine glass, dishes and the chair  remained.  When our bread came, we asked 2 different people for plates and silverware, one disappeared, the other brought plates, and had to come back with utensils.  After the people next to us had left, new ones came and ordered, then we're served. We finally looked for John, to ask where our food was, he was actually in the kitchen trying to find it.  Food: My husband ordered probably one of the simplest items on the menu, nachos, no chicken. When they F-I-N-A-L-L-Y came out, they were with chicken, and burnt to a dark brown crisp. I don't even see how that is possible!  So of course they went back.  My chicken Madeira was fantastic, perfect even, I actually got the extra sauce that I always request, and never get. So, at Hubby's insistence, I ate my hot food while hot. He waited. When I was done, and the people next to us, who were seated a good 20 minutes after us, had appetizers, drinks, dinner then had ordered dessert and were finishing it, my husband still hadn't gotten his nachos. They finally came out, a bit burnt on the edges, but edible for the most part. So our quick dinner had turned into a fiasco.  We always enjoy our food here, service is either top notch, normally we sit at the bar, you have someone literally standing there who can help you. (Salt, pepper, butter, water, napkins...) or spotty, at seats, you see someone and then they disappear. Then they mess up the order.

We've been to this particular one over a dozen times especially after shopping at Macy's or in the Mall.   The staff is great, the food is great you may have to deal with a little bit of  a wait if you go during peak times but once you get seated, they are on the ball.   My favorite appetizers is the Firecracker Salmon, crab cakes or buffalo wings, and they have this deep fried, beer batter avocado, mushroom concoction that is off the hook.  As for my main dish, you can't go wrong with the Grilled Chicken and Avacado Club or the Miso Salmon, Cuban sandwich or anything on the menu, I love it all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pleasanton?start=740,3.44,3.41,3.32,2.8000000000000003,3.422

This review was long over-due but I would like to express how horrified I STILL am with the service here. I came here with a large party for a friend's birthday and will NEVER go back. There were about 18 of us and yes, we were all under 21, but you can't judge a book by its cover. So, to the servers that I heard complain, you are UNPROFESSIONAL and it is a bad reflection of your personal character and of the restaurant.  Before we were even sat, the hostess gave us a cold welcome and was disrespectful when I handed her a dirty fork to take from the table I was seating on.  So here we are, just being seated from a 2 hour wait and the servers are preoccupied with their pessimistic attitudes and the hostess was upset because she had to pick up a dirty fork from the table. She was so upset that she left it there anyway. I wish I can give my 2 servers a 5 star review because they were fantastic, but I can't because of everything else. I'm sorry guys.

My steak was cooked perfectly also mid rare,  but the sauce wasn't my taste at all. The shrimp scampi is also fried which I didn't realize until they brought out the plate. I ordered under factory combos where they pair 1/2 portions of a few different meals. So there wasn't a full description and my scampi was fried. Also not my prefference.

We sat outside for the first time, which was probably a bad idea considering we all wore shorts on a windy day. But I was more concerned out food would get cold, which it didn't. We tried the Chicken Samoas, and they were alright the filling was good but the dough was just a wonton wrapper, true samoa eaters know that's a no-no!

He seemed bothered by everyone and like he really didn't want to be there. The service was only okay. When they brought my daughter's drink it had something floating around in it and had to send it back. One of the things I really like about the cheesecake factory is there passion iced tea but when I ordered my drink and it came out it looked very cloudy and the taste was not good at all. I asked what was going on with there tea and I was told that they had just changed tea brands.  The look and taste was not good. I showed the waiter and another waitress and they agreed. I'm very disappointed that they did that. I hope that the rest of the cheesecake factories don't change brands because that would be a total deal breaker for me a would probably stop eating here.  I hope they read this and reconsider going back to the paradise brand as it makes a huge difference.

There is a nice mixed drink HH menu as well for $5.00 each.  All of the food were big portions. 4 sliders, 4 Mac n cheese balls and about 8 wontons. We couldn't finish it. We both liked the sliders that came with pickles and the Mac n cheese balls with red sauce. The wonton app was just okay. There wasn't much filling a 1/3 of each piece was empty fried wrapper.

The set-up is very nice and consists of multiple types of seating areas to accommodate various customer needs or preferences. The food was great, I ordered a steak dish (Surprisingly can't remember the name) and it was very delicious. It came with mashed potatoes, mushrooms, and a little bit of caramelized onions. The sauce was very delicious and had the right amount of seasoning to it. There wasn't too much or too less of salt and it was complimented the steak very cohesively. The Louisiana chicken pasta was very delicious also and I must say that I like large portions of food and the portions were just right. The appetizers like the crab wontons and veggie avocados bites-sized snacks were one of the best foods I've ever had. Fresh and well prepared. Some restaurants don't put in too much effort for their appetizers compared to their entrées but this place certainly puts a 100% effort in all of their food.

So my friend and I walk in and tell the host we're doing happy hour. We sit at a high table and after 5min or so a girl greets us and takes our drink order. Before she walked away I asked if they serve bread to happy hour seatings as well and she said yes. (If she would've said no then I would've sat at a regular table....)yeah I came for the bread!! So yes we took about 15min to order but hey our drinks weren't even at our table yet!! And neither was the bread. So I finally placed an order for the Asian chicken salad no onions dressing on side. Hello you have a book to write orders in it especially if you're ""busy"" and definitely if there are food modifications requested....i finally got my drink and salad. No onion but dressing was tossed in. I let my server know and because she didn't really seem to care I told her it's ok...it was NOT ok. But i stayed patient. We asked for our bread when our drinks came and then again when my salad came.""I don't know"" is what she says. As I was eating my salad I asked my friend to dig in, sorry no settings for her because the waitress used one of our two to greet another table. I'm a server myself, i know the cutting corners trick too, I just remember to replace the second place setting. After waiting 15more min of watching the server check on every table except us (avoiding us, knowing we were upset) I finally got up and waited at the side of the host stand for at least a min with three people there and none acknowledging me. A girl in normal clothes looked up at me then away without asking anything. Finally I stopped a guy, asked to change our server, let the girl (aka manager Melinda who finally decided to acknowledge me) know I wanted a different server and I've been waiting 50min for just bread now. Her excuse of being out of bread didn't work on me because like I told her the other tables sat after us already received their bread lonnnggg ago. She apologized, re sat me at a booth, spilled some of my margarita on the table as she placed it down. Never saw her again. New server took a little long to greet but was awesome. I told Matthew about the salad situation through hesitation not wanting to complain about everything but he was awesome about it and fixed it for me. Brought my desserts out very quickly and kept apologizing even though I told him not to. Nothing on my check was comped but hey we got a server that brought us bread in 2min upon greeting us! I'm a server myself and if my table waits even 20min for their appetizer/entree we automatically take care of our guests because we actually care! We don't ignore because of being uncomfortable. It's only a Wednesday.The restaurant was not even busy but everything took so long. Horrible manager on duty. I may be younger but I know how to treat others especially if I'm getting paid to keep others happy. This is the second time I came in over one year and the first experience was just as horrific as the second. Our entrees took over 50min the last experience.

PF Chang might have been a better experience since everyone was flocking into The Cheesecake Factory to only get let down by poor qualty service and food.  Great service and great food come hand in hand to really experience a fine restaurant. However, this Cheesecake Factory was unacceptable.  The welcomeness wasn't there. Sundays are the busiest day in the week especially popular restaurants.  The restaurant was pretty filthy. The tables weren't wipe down, napkins from the previous diners still near my seat. Silverware with dried soap marks, hot water on a clean cloth to buffer out the residue could  solve that, but nope the server brings us crusty silverware.  Our server was very inattentive. Very chatty with his ""homie"" but failed to stop by our table to ask if our main dishes came out great. He keeps bringing us new cups of water in exchange for our full glass of water. Maybe this was his idea of attentive service.   My gf's pasta dish was unbearable, she had the Evelyn's Favorite Pasta, the chicken had this icey wetnesd in the center and was so dry. The pasta looked like it has been sitting because the texture was chewy. The nastiest part was the signature bell pepper and purple eggplants, yummmm, NOT. Think again. The bell pepper look used and abused, and the eggplant looked sautéed until thr eggplants shribbled like a scrotum.   My bang bang  was edible, yes, but pleasurable? No. I chose this dish for its curry blend with coconut and nuts with a chicken and shrimp. I think the menu needs to be reworded to describe the bang bang. Basically my dish was a thick blend of curry (maybe yellow), coconut flakes (which didnt blend well, if they had done coconut milk it would be better), and the nuts didnt go well with the coconut flakes.  Ugly dish with mushy mango bits in the  middle with cold rice in the center. The scary thing is, my bang bang looked nothing like the picture thats on their website. Don't laugh at my turd looking bang bang.  What's up  with the lighting? Is it me or its super dim inside.  Pros:  + Appetizers were tastey and affordable  + Small plates and appetizers presentation + food quality was on point Cons:  - poor restaurant service  - filthy silverware  - inattentive restaurant staff - food quality was weak  Good for first dates?

Person who answered reassure me manager would call me back as soon as possible that evening and I wasn't asking for free meal just wanting to make sure he knew and hopes to prevent it from happening to another customer.  That was saturday today three days later still no call so I decide to call again today. Big mistake!

We (3 of us) were seated promptly but that is where our service ended.  Our server brought our beverages (water) and just put them on the table and dropped our bread off on the fly.  After 10 to 15 minutes took our order, left for 3-5 minutes then came back to confirm our order.  We waited over 35 minutes for our meal.  2 of our 3 meals were delivered.  Both were a bit dried out as if they had been sitting under the warmer too long.  After another 10-15 minutes we were able to get our servers attention to find out where our third meal was.  She returned a few minutes later with our last dinner, set it down and said ""it was just sitting there"". Our waters were empty at that point and we asked for refills and more bread which was handled promptly. Then we got our check.  She dropped it off and disappeared for several minutes.  The check she left at our table was not ours!  When we got her attention she took it back and brought us the correct check and some other guest's credit card.  Our check had been charged to someone else's card!  We asked to speak to the manager and walked the card to the server to point out the problem.  We could see her talking with her manager at this point.  She brought a final correct check to us.  We paid our bill with a gift card and left the restaurant with a very bad opinion of The Cheesecake Factory.  We expressed this to the manager once again as we left, receiving an apology.

It's never a good sign when an establishment clearly has no focal point and offers anything from Chinese food to Italian.  My sister loves to drag me to places like this. It was Sunday and I wanted to do some shopping at the mall. And this place is connected to the mall. How....Convenient....  We waited OVER an hour to be sat for a party of two. It was fairly obvious to me that the hostess had completely forgotten about us because everyone else we ""arrived"", meaning people who had put their names before and after us, had ridiculously numbered parties of 6 or 10 and they were seated first. We kept waiting and waiting and waiting until a manager had to step in and fix the hostess's mistake. I was seething...  Once we sat, the table next to us ALSO looked unhappy. Apparently they had been waiting for their main course entrees for over an hour. I inspected my silverware and there was old crusted food and something that looked like white paint all over my utensils. I was getting less and less hopeful and decided to drown my doubts and negative feelings with brunch appropriate cocktails. Got a new set of silverware, and I ordered the kale and quinoa salad to speed up the kitchen process. Our server was good and attentive, and the floor manager assigned to our area always checked in on us. The service once we sat down was good but I just couldn't get over my overall negative vibes from this place. The servers and runners looked exhausted and short staffed and everyone was trying very hard to make it a good day but I was not feeling it.

448,Peter P.,"Tracy, CA",25,27,,2.0,2015-03-16,"I think the best way to give this review is to just say what my family and I ordered, and what we got instead. We ordered Buffalo Wings for an appetizer, with ranch dressing instead of the Bleu Cheese. I asked for the Factory Grande Burrito and a Strawberry Lemonade.  I asked if the guacamole/sour cream/etc was outside of the burrito or not.  Our waiter explained that they put it outside.  I asked if they could put all of that within the burrito instead, and he said okay. My wife asked for the Ahi Tuna Salad (I don't remember the exact name) and a Margarita. For our two boys, one wanted the Mini Sliders with Fresh Fruit and Milk.  Our other son wanted the Chicken Strips with French Fries and Apple Juice. Let's start with the drinks.  My wife and I got our drinks before the kids, and they even brought out the wings before our kids got their drinks.  I would think that a restaurant would try to bring out the kids' drinks first, as kids are usually the quickest to complain; we had to let them share sips of our water because they didn't even have cups of water for the kids.  When the kids finally got their drinks, it was two apple juices, but the waiter was in such a hurry that they left before we could say anything.  After a bit we let them know they got the order wrong and we got the milk. The wings were good, but the dipping sauce was either bleu cheese, or the cheesiest ranch dressing I've ever had. My burrito came and the guacamole/sour cream/salsa/etc was not outside the burrito.  It also wasn't IN the burrito.  They just left it out completely. My son's chicken strips were served with fresh fruit, even though he ordered the fries.  My other son had NO side dish served with his Mini Sliders.  The waiter assured us the fries were coming; they never came. The kids and I had finished our drinks, but the waiter never came by for free refills.  He DID ask my wife if she wanted another Margarita, though. For me, it's unfortunate when a restaurant gets an order wrong or mixed up, but it's also understandable.  It's pretty bad, though, when you mess up almost EVERY order; the only order without a problem was my wife's salad.  I don't think we'll come back here because of that.  Plus we paid $90 for the meal.  The only reason this place doesn't get one star is because the food was decent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pleasanton?start=500,2.28,2.76,3.048,2.152,2.568

If the restaurant is short staffed, that is one issue, but giving customers raw food is a health concern (salmonella).

Well, to start with I would say that the staff is great, they always take a good care of you. They'll come and ask you in between meals if you need anything or u liked the food or not. And for the vegetarians, you can always ask to not have the meat in your dish or u can have it on the side. The place is clean even after so much foot print.  Coming to the food, I love the sweet brown bread they serve. The menu is so big that it sometimes gets little confusing. But the good thing is that you get lots and lots of options.  The tomato basil pasta, four cheese pasta, stuffed mushrooms, shrimp , Jamaican shrimp and chicken, Cajun chicken( from the special plates menu), all the  cheese cakes are the few things which I really like.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pleasanton?start=560,2.56,2.62,3.032,2.516,2.596

Now the last time we had eaten here was before we had such a restrictive diet so we didn't have to worry about what we ate. But I figured a place like Cheesecake Factory had to have something we can eat, even if we made substitutions and let the server know of our gluten-free, grain-free & sugar-free dietary needs. It took us a while to browse their menu because of how large it is, but also because we read almost every item & description carefully to see what was in it & what we can sub in or out. The server in our section looked pretty busy, but eventually another server came to our table to let us know that our actual server was backed up & that she would be helping out. She took our drink orders and gave us a few more minutes with the menu. Our server came up to us and apologized for the wait (Thank you!) We decided to order the steak, green beans, spinach, the 1/2 chicken & steamed carrots. We let the server know of our dietary restrictions and she said that she will definitely make a note on the order. (Thank you again!) We asked how all the veggies were cooked making sure there were no marinades or sauces. She said no that they were either steamed or just cooked in olive oil. For the chicken, it's supposed to have a sauce, but I asked if they could just cook the 1/2 chicken with no sauce, just plain. She said that was not problem! She was very friendly & very considerate of how ""picky"" we needed to be. As we waited for our food, the other server who was helping us as well, came up to us with a bread basket, and she said, ""I wasn't sure but I thought I'd ask..."" And we laughingly told her, ""No thank you, but you were definitely right that we didn't want the bread"" Our food came out and everything looked delicious! All the veggies were cooked perfectly. All we added was salt & pepper. Spinach & green beans were cooked in olive oil and the carrots were steamed plain. The steak was tender & juicy as well as the 1/2 chicken. Another woman who we assumed was the manager that evening came to our table to make sure that all our food was cooked accordingly and that there were no mistakes in the preparation. Before we left, we thanked our server for being considerate to our dietary needs. She informed us that they are definitely happy to accommodate and have been improving on being sensitive to customers with different restrictions. It's good to know that we can still go to a chain restaurant and find something on the menu and that the staff is friendly & helpful to accommodate such restrictions. Thank you Cheesecake Factory!

Finally our food comes and he has some lame excuse they lost our order. It would have been nice if he would have just come over and told us that. And there was really no apology or anything.  I was there again a couple weeks ago at 4 in the afternoon and we were sitting in the bar area. Again, hardly anyone in there. There were 3 of us at the table. Part of an order came out for one person...we waited...and waited. Finally we told her to eat. Then they brought the second order...and we waited and waited...then they brought the remainder of the first order. And AGAIN our waiter was no where to be found. They were both almost done when mine finally came. And when the waiter FINALLY showed us, he said they made the wrong order. So...he knew the kitchen or someone screwed up, but he couldn't just come out and let us know? As much as I like the menu, I doubt i will ever come back.

I think that when you go to a restaurant, you should have the same experience if you go in when they open or 5 min. before they close.  Got to the restaurant 30 min before closing. My wife and I spent the entire day at the fair with the kids and didn't have dinner. Not to mention that we hadn't seen each other over a week due to my job, so we wanted some us time. Got greeted by Michelle?  I think. Got the name from the check as she did not introduce her self. Instead she asked for our drinks and asked if we were ready to order. I didn't even get to open my menu, so we just ordered drinks. We had to repeat our selves a lot as she couldn't hear us. It wasn't because I wasn't loud enough, but due to the lack of attention span on this girl. She kept twitching and moving around like on some type of drug.  Anyways we finally got our drinks a little late as the bartender was in the restroom as Michelle said. We ordered our food but my wife couldn't get her food as the soup had been taken a way. So she only ordered a dinner salad.  Got our food and it wasn't that bad except that in my pasta I had angel pasta and penne pasta, but It didn't supose to come with it. You could tell that the cooks had sent the pasta baskets to the dish machine and they where just putting the pasta in the water, no big deal.  I know about 2 bites 2 minutes check back, but she came back and asked if she can bag it for us. I said no in a stern voice as I was starting to get annoyed. I also had to ask for bread, even though they usually bring it out before the meal. She had to check if they had any. I order dessert and coffee but she had to check if they had coffe, they did not, so I asked for dessert togo.  Over all a horrible experience.

She wore her dark black sunglasses while taking our order and was not wanting to be there. I wish I took pictures to show you all the unprofessional ism. It took over 40 minutes for our food.

We chose to do the curb side pick up. We placed the order at 10:55 am the gentleman was polite and informed me they open at 11 so our order would go right in. He said it would be ready by 11:20. I called back in at 11:02 to add a few more items to the order. Monica answered and said she had to connect me to the bakery? I sat on hold for ten minutes. I placed the call on hold and called back and another gal answered who took my updated order and said it would all be ready in ten minutes. We left and arrived to curb side pick up by 11:25. There is 3 designated spots for pick up and they were all taken by cars that were not using curb side pick up. We sat in the handicap spot thinking it would be a quick turn around. Instead we found ourselves waiting for 20 minutes in our car, several attempts to call the restaurant only lead to minute long rings before an answer to either put me on hold or say it was on its way out. Each call they acted like this was brand new, news that we were outside. There was also another gentleman who arrived 2 minutes after us going through the same thing making the same amount of calls. Finally I asked for the manager which was as useless as my other calls. He said HE would be out in less than a minute with our food. Of course that was not the case. I ended up walking into the restraunt my self. I finally got my order and was expressing my dissatisfaction to the manger and he honestly could have cared less. He said what did I want them to do, our food was hot and that they had a huge catering order today. I explained that was an excuse and did not make me feel any better. They are the ones who gave us our pick up time not me. I shouldn't be sitting in a car in a parking lot for 20+ minutes waiting for my food that should have been ready a long time ago. The curb side pick up sign says MAXIMUM TEN MINUTES PARKING so what happens when the restaurant takes longer? Shouldn't there have been an accommodations an apology a discount? According to this place NO.  They had several opportunities to make this situation right every phone call saying I was outside someone could have be honest and said it was still cooking.

I realized this the next AM and called them they said they had the card and I was there in a few minutes to pick it up. The girl at the reception said you have to go to the take out area and ask them. The girl at that counter had no clue but said she would find out. After 20 minutes of back and forth with a variety of people one man came out asked my name and 2 mins later said ""we don't have it"". I then stressed to talk to manager bec they had already told me they had it. The manager then walked out and took card from his front pocket and gave it to me. The level of incompetence was striking. The girl at front then said to me ""oh I thought you were asking me about gift cards"". The final nail in coffin was a day later I was informed by my bank that my card had suspicious activity and was used by someone. I had to cancel it. Moral don't make mistake I did and leave your card. You don't know who is handling it in back and what they are doing with the info. The second visit was w a large group of 8 ppl and we were told it would be 45- 1 hr. We waited and 11/2 hrs later were told that they are waiting for a party to finish. My wife pressed the receptionist about the time and maybe they could find another area instead of just waiting for that one table to get up( there were several empty areas). Her response during that conversation was ""don't put words in my mouth"" I told you it would be a while.

We wanted to roam around the mall while we waited but we couldn't do that.  The complimentary breads that come with the meals are pretty good. I personally prefer the sourdough bread but I know many prefer the sweeter oat bread.  Server and waiter were both professional and even tried to make small talk. Waiter constantly refilled our waters, packed our leftovers in boxes, and asked questions.   Chicken Potstickers ($10.50) - Very overpriced. You only get 5 and they're only okay. A tad too salty. You can buy cheaper (and probably better) ones at Costco.  Fried Portobello Mushrooms, Avocados, and Zucchini ($6.95) - Actually decent. It came with two sauces, both of which were good. The zucchini was the best of the three. Enough to share for 3-4. I would get this again if I come back. Tiramisu Cheesecake ($7.50) - Cheesecake was so so so good but the bottom coffee later was not so good. It was too bitter and more of a cake rather a crust. I really wish the cheesecake had a crust I could bite into.  S'more Galore Cheesecake ($7.95) - If you like graham crackers, marshmallows, and chocolate... Then you can't go wrong with this cheesecake. Creative display. Cheesecake is more of a chocolate displace but the crust is exceptional with chocolate chips lined on the outer crust.  The food at Cheesecake Factory isn't memorable, but their cheesecakes certainly are. We will come back here but solely for the cheesecake!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pleasanton?start=320,2.72,2.56,2.888,2.412,2.624

It's always a hit or miss but usually more hits. The place itself is always very clean and I always feel fancy eating here, even though I'm in jeans or something; there are these lights around the place that remind me of the Eye of Sauron...haha When it's a Friday night or the weekends, expect it to be super duper busy. They're usually pretty good with organizing guests but always make sure they have your times right and your name on a list. Service does take a lot longer on busy nights, even just to get drinks but I can see that it's one server running a lot of tables. I wouldn't get wings or things that take longer to cook on busy nights because they would come out raw on the inside.  As for my favorite here, it was Shrimp with Angel Hair; giant shrimps with a lot of tomato. Recently, it's changed to Pasta da Vinci. Even though I really don't like mushrooms, this dish is an exception. Pasta is never undercooked but sometimes they're over just a bit, not a big deal to me. The best drink in my opinion is their strawberry lemonade, with some sugar around the rim of the glass. As for dessert, the Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake is the best, simple yet delicious! Final Thoughts: Prices are as expected here, portions pretty big in size... I love this place but sometimes there are just things that turn me off a bit.

After I told our waiter that my pasta was uncooked, the manager Will West came to our table only to argue with me and tell me the pasta's are all al dente! Going back and forth finally he took it back and brought it back again without the sauce and the only vegetable I had asked for. No one checked on us for another 30 minutes. Meanwhile, we were informed that one of our other entree were given to another table in error. So at this point we only had 3/5 entrees and we had been there for over 2 hours now! Too late for our movie  we were suppose to watch, Mr. West comes back after I asked for him from 2 waiters and argues with me for about 5 minutes. I was literally speechless. Finally, a second manager approaches our table. At least this managers was sympathetic towards our feelings and the time we had wasted waiting around for dinner. I have never had a restaurant make so many errors and then argue with the customer as to why I should just eat it.

Looking at the average reviews of every Cheesecake Factory location in the area will prove this to you. Why people come here looking for an outstanding dining experience is beyond me. Me, I take this chain of mega-restaurants for what it is: mediocre food at premium prices. The Cheesecake Factory was one of the first restaurants to start the menu-as-long-as-a-short-story trend; the menu here is pages upon pages of mixed up cuisines that try too hard which results in, probably, hundreds of dishes done just okay but none of them outstanding.  My mother-in-law brought me here for lunch today before we did some shopping. I had the Cobb Salad and she had some kind of chicken/arugula/pasta dish. We had calamari to start with but I psyched myself out of eating it remembering this NPR story about how some calamari rings are actually pig rectum. We asked our server to hold the bread but he brought it anyway so we ate some. The food was alright. Edible, beyond giant portions. The only reason I would come back is for cheesecake, exclusively. I wondered aloud why I even bothered ordering real food when the cheesecake was CLEARLY the star of the meal. Our waiter was much more concerned with working the booth next to us full of four extremely loud, probably buzzed, mid-30s aged women. He seemed distracted and scattered. Everything about this place is JUST okay: food, service, atmosphere.  My biggest complaint is how LONG we were in there: Took forever to be seated, to have our order taken, to receive food, to have plates cleared, to order dessert, to pay, to get the hell out.

I like the Cheesecake Factory because the baseline of their services is great and then they go above to make sure that all guests experience a good meal in a great setting. I love going to the one located in Pleasanton as the manager Ashley Louie is the nicest and friendliest person that you will ever meet. I believe that all employees aim to be nice and personable. The portions are really quite large so if one is moderately hungry, one can share with a friend or take it home in a doggie bag. It's also a great place to order dessert and with a cheesecake selection that is long and varied, everyone will be pleased! I love the chocolate chocolate chocolate flourless cake!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pleasanton?start=420,2.24,2.5,2.604,2.484,2.396

Julio was our server who started off as attentive & informative as it was our first time eating here. We ordered Jamaican Shrimp, Kobe burger & Chicken Madera. The drinks & food were very good. We also ordered the salted caramel cheesecake but were told they were out. The Taramisu was suggested to us so we chose that. I was very disappointed that the cheesecake served to us was frozen and difficult to cut with the teaspoons given to us. I tried to flag our server down three times but was not able to get his attention. I thought the Cheesecake Factory was famous for the freshness & quality of the cheesecakes served!

Our utensils were dirty too, food was on the forks & I was ready to go then! But we were a party of 9 so I had to stay. We sat at the table for an entire hour with our waters and lemonades before we ever got food. Once the food came out, mine was wrong!

The food we ordered were only okay, nothing to rave about.. We got the Factory Combinations: Shrimp Scampi & Salmon; and the Shrimp Scampi & Steak Diane. They were smaller in portions. We thought the shrimp scampi would have pasta in it but it was just probably 3 shrimps in there, no pasta. The Steak Diane was a little too sweet for my taste. Their cocktails were good but when we asked for something off the menu, they weren't able to get it right. Hopefully next time, they can just be honest and say that they don't know how to make it.

I've had their pot stickers, buffalo blasts, cashew chicken, their cornbread appetizer thingy, southwestern egg rolls, steaks, won ton puff things, etc.  My favorites are definitely the luau chicken salad (every bite is filled with fresh deliciousness) and their country fried chicken sliders (get buffalo sauce on the side and make mini buffalo chicken sandwiches). Sooooo good! I definitely recommend those!  And their cheesecake is, of course, phenomenal! Can't go wrong with any option really.  Ask for Mariah when you go. Best server I've had there. The other servers are good too (I think I've only had one that was horrible), but she is on top of her serving game. Always brought refills without asking, was prompt, brought our food out hot, super good personality, etc. She just seemed to be a really hard worker. She's good at her job.

I got the Grilled Steak Medallions, which is basically four circular ""medallions"" shaped beef slices on top of mashed potatoes surrounded by a sauce with asparagus, tomatoes, and mushrooms. The mashed potatoes were delicious and creamy. (Well, I'm a potato fanatic so I don't complain much when it comes to potatoes) The sauce, though, was extremely salty. To make matters worse, the mashed potatoes and steak were swimming in it so there was no escaping the salty-ness of the dish. The portions were pretty big, so I didn't have room for cheesecake.

Almost An hour wait for party of 9 to be seated despite about half the tables were empty (they were too small for a large party, but numerous others were waiting as well).Zoom forward.  It's now 10 to 1 pm and everyone at our table got their food 10 minutes ago ( that's correct, another 45+ minute wait at the table) and I still have none. Waitress has been nice, doing a good job. Manager apologized, comped meal, but still no food.  Food just arrived 1:05, almost 15 minutes after food for others arrived. They were mostly done eating so I ate while they watched. I ordered steak tacos. Comes with rice and beans. Both of which were barely warm. Tacos were quite good. Fresh and hot. All the others in our party said the food was great. Once again, our waitress was great. I feel bad for the waitress and manager. I'm not in the food business, so all I can do is guess. I think what may have happened is some of the kitchen staff didn't show up or they just can't find enough. I'm guessing why half the tables were empty yet people were waiting is because they wouldn't have been able to cook enough for all the tables. That is reinforced by the time we waited for food. I've eaten here before and everything was excellent. So again, my guess, they were swamped and didn't have enough kitchen staff. Caught off guard if you will. They had plenty of wait staff. The manager was running around like crazy, so I should give her, and the rest the benefit of doubt and chalk it up to a bad day. Everyone is entitled to that once in awhile.

We waited outside in the waiting area.There was another party of 4 who was seated before us and had checked in after we did. There was also another family with a disabled person who had checked right after us and told their wait was 30-40 minutes. So I checked back in with a worker by the name of Lyric (a young black female) worker who was in charge of the lists. When I inquired about where we were on the lists, she immediately stated oh you have another 25 minutes. She didn't look at the list for my name and we had already been waiting for 30 minutes. I woo-saahhhed and went to the side to wait and watch how lyric was going to interact with the other customers. As I watched for the next 20 minutes, I noticed her interactions were more positive then what she had showed me. The next time we went to follow up on our table I sent my sister over. Lyric was better with her interaction and stated that we were the next table of 4 to be seated.  Needless to say we were not the next party of four to be seated. When were finally seated it took an additional 10 minutes or so for a waiter to come to our table.  When our food arrived it took an additional 35 minutes and the food was cold and our order was wrong. As we were almost finished with our meal we realized that the family with the disabled family member were still sitting outside. Mind you the wait time was supposed to be 30-40 minute the family had been forgotten about and had waited for almost 2 hours!!! The speaker for the outside people did't seem to be working and the workers didn't have the common courtesy to go outside to check if the parties were ready or inform them that their table was ready.

501,Sun B.,"Dublin, CA",32,108,65.0,5.0,2016-01-25,"This is a typical American restaurant  -  where service is shoddy, but people still visit because of giant food portions. We love their food and I think,  giving them 5 stars is fair enough.  We eat here on weekday nights, get the leftovers boxed up and don't have to cook at home for the next 3-4 days.  We are always treated well here and keep coming back. Since their portions are so huge,  the food last a bunch of days and we love that!   I don't understand why this restaurant is rated so low. 3 stars total?  C'mon people!  It seems most of the reviewers giving bad ratings are like  -  ""To one who strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also"" and that doesn't work everywhere because businesses are built on customer service,  it's a given.  If not, then they should be shut down.  But Cheesecake Factory,  which apparently people feel provides awful service,  has been doing that for decades and is still surviving because everyone has put up with it. Why? Because of the extremely low standards of customer service that folks have in the United States.  Raise your standards to how you should be treated and then maybe restaurants like this won't exist. For now, it does exist and no wonder only in United States can it exist. This restaurant won't survive or do that well in Europe as a matter of fact,  but anyways,  that's not the point.  Everyone knows that this is a lousy restaurant. That's a given at any American restaurant after 1906. We are not living in those times anymore.  I have got tips for people who WANT to get a good service out of the staff working here: First, order take out only (problem solved, yay!) Second, if you can't order takeout and HAVE to dine here, then you can utilize the following rules: 1) Give giant big smiles to the staff working here, just like their giant food portions. 2) Greet your server like you are meeting them after 10 long years! 3)  Keep praising the food so loud that every server passing by can hear you The staff here are not paid well at all,  so it is pretty common for employees at places like these to provide ghastly customer service.  The staff feel the need to take it out on the 'vulnerable customer' rather than having a spine and standing up to the 'company management / owner' who exploits them by paying them so low in the first place.  However, in spite of that, there are ways in which you can get a good service out of the staff (see above). Pretty often, the server will forget to bring your second course. Worry not, go up to the counter and say ""I am dying to have the second course, it is sooooo yummy! Oh my gosh I cannot wait!"".  The server will automatically either apologize or give you a serious look and say  ""I will go check if your food is ready and bring it out"".  The food is usually always ready but that's their standard excuse, don't feel upset.  If you are done eating and want to get out of here as fast as possible,  then just go up to the counter again and politely ask for the check. And voila you are done!  Just play by the above rules if you have to eat here and everything will be splendid!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pleasanton?start=540,2.68,2.45,2.564,2.324,2.5420000000000003

684,Dave N.,"Woodbridge, CA",14,66,398.0,2.0,2016-01-29,"I have mixed feelings about this place based on the last time we came here. We came here early to beat the lunch crowd. When I say early, I mean around 11:20am. There were plenty of seats and we were pretty much seated instantly. For the place to be as dead as it was, it was a little awkward getting greeted by our waitress after 10-15 minutes of waiting around. We saw other waiters and waitresses helping out other tables but apparently our table was apart of another server's section. She apologized and told us about how she had to defuse a situation in her section. We again thought it was really weird that she only had us to wait on, and her main section was located in a different part of the restaurant. No worries, we told her. We eventually got to ordering and after a long wait our food finally came out. During the wait, the restaurant started filling up until literally the place was packed. During the waiting time we started noticing our waitress start to forget that she was assigned that 1 table in that whole other section (our section). When our food came out, there were parts of the dish that were warmer than other parts. This was something I was able to overlook because my food still tasted great. I went with the Parmesan-Herb Crusted chicken which was 3 sautéed chicken breast, green beans and mashed potatoes. I figured I would try something new. I've always gone with the orange chicken for the past couple of years eating here at all locations. The only place I had eaten a Parmesan Crusted Chicken was at BJs Brewery. With Cheesecake Factory having so many dishes, it's always been hard to specialize and hone in on each dish that comes out of the kitchen. I thought my food I ate was delicious and rivaled well with the Parmesan Crusted Chicken I had at BJs. I'm also happy they didn't hold back on the vegetables. Only complaint about my meal was an inconsistent temperature across the items, and the juice from the chicken mixed in with the vegetables made for an unnecessary crossing of flavors that didn't work too well together.  While I enjoyed my meal, my girl's experience with her plate was a complete 180 Degree Turn. She went for the Jumbo Shrimp combo. Her french fries weren't hot, or warm at all, they were actually cold. The shrimp itself wasn't even warm at all. She was beyond disappointed. It's all bad when you can eat your meal and almost predict how everything went in the kitchen. It was obvious her plate was done first, they cooked mine, and put on the hottest thing on my plate (green beans) last, then the plates were sitting out for awhile. After our food was brought out, our waitress was completely MIA at this point. She didn't come back to check on us, and even if we wanted to complain about how cold my lady's food was, no one was checking on us at all. I had to flag down a waiter helping the table right next to us, to ask him to get us the check. We didn't want to wait another 30 minutes for them to re-cook my girl's food.  Sad to say this location is a flop. You try to get here on a day at a reasonable to get seated and served on time. This place only half way delivered. On a regular weekend day, don't be surprised if your wait time is 25 minutes to an hour. For God's sake get your shit situated with what employees are working what areas. It was awkward for us watching other waiters and waitresses being attentive to our tables and us not seeing our waitress at all because all of her tables are elsewhere. It wasn't just strange for us, other guests were noticing that it came off like we were getting ignored.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pleasanton?start=360,2.76,2.47,2.552,1.9600000000000002,2.5860000000000003

It's like being in an abusive relationship. I think to myself, ""Maybe this is the time that they'll get it together?"" But no. It never works out. My most recent visit is what brought me to air out my feelings via Yelp. Some friends and I agreed to meet for dinner there on a Sunday evening, expecting it to be crowded. No problem. We arrive and are greeted with a ""1-2 hour wait"" which is reasonable. We notice there are some adjacent tables at the bar so we decided to camp out until we could create a tic-tac-toe of seating to fit everyone.  Eventually we were able to accomplish this and let the servers know we would happily take separate checks if necessary, we just wanted to sit together. They provide us menus and let us know they would be with us shortly to take our drink orders. However, I was unprepared for the ensuing game of hide and go seek I was in for after our waitress disappeared for 30 minutes.  Fortunately, I was able to find our mythical waitress. She apologized profusely and took our drink order of some diet cokes, a few cocktails, and mostly waters. This seemed straight forward to me but 25 minutes later when I received my cocktail the ice cubes were former shells of themselves.  This was only the beginning, however. Shortly thereafter we were notified that they were unable to make my girlfriend's food as they were out of flatbread. This information would've been valuable much earlier but I digress. The manager gave a quick mutter of an apology and let her know he would be back with a menu shortly. Little did I know that the manager must hold down a part time job as a magician, as his disappearing act was phenomenal.   I once again was able to corral a waitress back over to our table to get a menu. She took the order and assured us it would be ready 'on the fly.' I was skeptical. I was proven wrong once the food arrived 15 minutes. Or so I thought. The pasta had a texture similar to that of a rubber band.  Once we received the bill, I asked the waitress to comp the pasta. Not the entire meal, our drinks, or appetizers. Just the $16 bowl of pasta. This resulted in an overly generous $10. Who needs to win the Powerball when Cheesecake is giving out that kind cash? I paid the bill and left.

We were seated and given menus, but we had to wait around another ten minutes to meet our waiter. She took our drinks and we got them pretty quickly, but we didn't get our bread basket yet; we then asked our waiter and she said she'll be back with it. She came back and we were introduced to a new waiter but still no bread, and we then asked her. We probably waited twenty minutes to get our bread and we didn't have our entrees yet either. She said it would be out soon but we waited almost forty minutes for our food. And when she came out she only came out with three out of the four dishes. She also informed us that the fourth dish will be coming out soon too but we waited another twenty minutes for the fourth dish. So A LOT of waiting was done that night.  I ordered the Southern BBQ chicken salad. It was humongous, had lettuce romaines, black beans, tomatoes, grilled chicken, corn, avocado and thinly fried onion rings on top. It looked very appealing and really good to eat. But, when you bit into the chicken it was really cold, and if you bit into the fried onion ring it was really cold and almost soggy.

I ordered the 4 cheese pasta gluten free.  With a side of asparagus,  the asparagus was burned, tasted burnt, looked burned and smelled burned . They brough it back steamed . All in all the service was crap,  and when we got our check they over charged for 2 items and brought back 2 receipts that didnt make since , said because one item was for happy hour they couldnt mark it all on one receipt.  Thats crap. It was way over happy hour before we left. They changed the order served us poorly and because of that we didnt tip. I dont tip people if their services arent good . And i am a great tipper.

Our server, Caitlin, was: humorous, attentive, fast and outstanding. She was so awesome that she inspired me to serve MY tables better at my own restaurant. I often feel like a lot of servers, including myself, become robotic after a long shift. It's hard to make a connection with each and every table you serve. So I really appreciated that Caitlin made us feel at home. It really comes down to the simplest of things, for example: bringing out another side of ranch when I'm running low or offering ranch in lieu of bleu cheese in the first place since I don't like bleu cheese on my Buffalo Blasts (which are awesome, you should try it).

It's one of our favorite items on their appetizer list. It's crispy, salty, and flavorful. However, I will admit that this is not one of the best calamari you can get. For my entree, I ordered the garlic noodles with shrimp. I thought it tasted a little plain, dry and didn't really taste the garlic like I thought I would. Nonetheless, I still enjoyed my meal with beer and the complimentary bread. Their brown bread is the best! I always like to ask the server for another fresh batch of brown bread to go.  For dessert, I always order their red velvet cheesecake. It's my favorite flavor that they have and every bite is a little taste of heaven with a dash of whipped cream. Their cheesecake slices are pretty generous and the prices for them are fair. The cheesecakes are the best part of the restaurant.

On a Wednesday night, it took 30 minutes to get a table, which actually wasn't as bad as I've experienced waiting 2 hours for a table on a Friday night. Setting: If you've ever been to another Cheesecake Factory, it looks pretty much the same. Fairly large, lots of seating in booths and tables. I like that each table is pretty private, so it feels more secluded to your group. There's also outside seating for warm days. Service: AMAZING. My party was at the restaurant for over 3 hours, and our waitress didn't even try to rush us (which she probably should have, because so many people were waiting for a table).  Food: Honestly, you can't go wrong with anything. The menu is extensive and sometimes seems think of frightening, but whatever you pick will be good. I personally love the pastas, which are HUGE and always serve as leftovers for the next day! Also, the macaroni and. cheese balls (they are exactly what they sound like) are to die for!

I actually love Cheesecake Factory, but every time I have dined at this location- I am so upset that I chose this restaurant over the others in the area. My last time eating there, Sunday- was a disaster. To sum it up, we placed our order as soon as our server dropped off our drinks. More than 1 hour later, our food was brought. We were told that the kitchen was very busy, and that was the cause of delay. The first plate that was brought out, was wrong...So my server took it back and immediately returned with my order. I had ordered the chicken bacon avocado sandwich with fries. When I went to pick it up, the bottom of the sandwich was soaking wet and felt like a wet sponge. My fries were cold and tasted like they had been sitting out for a long period of time. My husbands order, which was eggs, English muffin and potatoes- was also cold, and his English muffin was hard as a rock, and didn't come with anything to go on it (no butter of jam) when our server passed by our table, we had him come over and look at our food. At this point, we didn't want to send it back and have it remade or anything. We were upset, we were hungry, and we just wanted to get the hell out of there. The manager came over and said he would take care of our bill... Thanks. We wouldn't have paid for it anyway. They could have made up for us and given us a gift card, and told us to come back so they could make it up to us... But they didn't.

On all occasions of coming here, I have also experienced at least one unpleasant element that left me not wanting to come back (but the GF has built up a strong tolerance to variation in quality of entrees as this is the only place she could get her beloved Pasta Da Vinci...). First the food, I always get at least one of the following: Pasta da Vinci, Steak Diane, Chicken Madeira. As for the appetizers: Firecracker Salmon, Avocado Eggrolls, Spinach crab dip. Those are my go to and recommendations. I have also enjoyed the Farfalle Garlic Pasta, Spicy Chipotle Pasta, Louisiana Chicken Pasta but nothing beats the all time Pasta DaVinci.  What are some of my unpleasant experiences? I have experienced long waits for food (up to an hour of just munching on their bread and butter), getting ignored on requests, receiving cold dishes. There are many more that I can nitpick but one that was absolutely not forgivable was the missing of an entire side and several key ingredients in a dish. I ordered the steak Diane with side of smashed potato. It came cold and missing mashed potato, onions, and mushrooms. After asking about it, the waiter had said we requested to have no mashed potato which we didn't and the mushroom and onions were just plain missing.

I had a party of 7 We first got into the restaurant and its took us awhile for us to get seated even though we were told only 20 minutes. After finally being seated , We thought things were getting better because we had a wonderful server named Caitlyn was covering for someone else who was on break. Caitlyn was an amazing server,  She was friendly, fast paced, overall on point. She took our drink orders and entrees. After the other server came back from her break, She didn't even introduce herself. (Name was Elizabeth, Caitlyn had told us before hand.) When she came back things went downhill real quick. My uncle ordered a cheesecake and Oreo milkshake. My little cousin had ordered loaded potato tots. Long story short with that, Elizabeth came to the table telling us they were out of the tots so my little cousin had to order something else. She ended up going with the chicken teriyaki. Elizabeth had told us she would out that order in ahead of everyone's since the rest of us got our entrees by this time. We all got ours but my uncles dessert and my little cousins food. 30 minutes later, Elizabeth forgot my uncles dessert. And hour and a half later,  My little cousins food FINALLY got to the table. We had complained to Elizabeth to higher management. We ended up getting a new server. Three servers in one night.  Here's everything that just went wrong: Elizabeth forgot the food, didn't refill our waters until we asked, never cleared the plates off our table (appetizer plates , etc.) , instead of my uncle getting the Oreo milkshake they brought a Oreo cheesecake so wrong order, and when she brought the wrong order she blamed it on Caitlyn, Elizabeth wasn't apologetic at all, she copped out and had someone else tell us that they forgot to put the teriyaki chicken order in. So much went wrong, I'm not even sure if I listed everything. That's how bad the whole experience was.  However Caitlyn again was amazing,  Unfortunately I don't remember the third server but she was amazing as well. Not so sure if I will come back to this location.

Luckily, we had just beaten the Monday (!) dinner crowd by a few minutes and were promptly seated. I had Chicken Madeira and my mom had some Crispy Crab Bites.  The one gripe I have with Cheesecake Factory is that it take an eternity to get to your food. I really thought that since we beat the dinner rush, we would have our food and an above than average time. When you keep on looking on you your watch, you know that you have waited for your food too long. And what is somewhat a let down is that beyond the elegant and chic decor, the quality and taste of TCF food is no better than your local Chill's or Applebee's.

Didn't offer to take it and started to walk away. Excuse me I didn't order the casserole surprise! I politely asked her to have it remade. She leaves and after about 20 minutes the waitress comes by and apologizes for it taking so long. I waited another 10 minutes and told the waitress to let the manager know never mind my party is all done eating. After another wait the manager comes back with the meal in a bag. Really what a joke! If I wanted to go food I wouldn't of waited 30 minutes to be seated and another 30 minutes for the food. Sad it used to have good customer service!

I wasn't blown away with the pasta I got, but it was fine. The real disappointment for me was the cheesecake. We got the fresh strawberry cheesecake to go so we could eat it when we got home and watching a movie. But honestly the slice they gave us was sooo small that it was not a very shareable piece. The strawberry sauce too was a little much. I've have this cheesecake plenty of times at other locations and have been given a decently sized piece.

In the Walnut Creek Cheesecake Factory, it's a world  of a difference in how they treat customers and it is quite evident as that restaurant is bustling and alive while this one seems rather empty and depressing from the get go. I called this place just to make sure we  would be allowed to bring our small, quiet Poodle on the patio with us on 9/4 around 4pm. The staff who answered the phone did not know so she put me on hold.  I was on hold for 45 MINUTES before i finally hung up and realized they forgot about me so I called again. She answered again and I told her she left me on hold for so long, but she was completely unapologetic. She then said no dogs unless it is a service dogs. Which is odd because a few months back the staff allowed our pooch on the patio, so clearly they are inconsistent.  I asked to speak to the manager to give feedback about being left on hold for 45 mins and she abruptly handed the phone to someone else. The manager then said no dogs allowed. When I gave her feedback that the staff put me on hold for 45 mins for a simple question and did not seem to care, she too was unapologetic. When I told her they allowed our pooch in the patio just a couple months ago, she did not care and responded in a rude manner just as bad as the first person.  When I asked for the manager's name so I can report to corporate because I was so disappointed in how I was being treated, she had the nerve TO HANG UP ON ME just like that. If the customer service is this bad just on the phone, it makes me wonder about how they handle the food, wait staff, food safety and other concerns. Clearly they don't care about the customer!

I got the burger I normally get and the wait time was pretty standard. The food, however, was not. The burger was super greasy and the fries tasted like they had been deep-fried multiple times. I felt like throwing up afterwards. Then the waitress took FOREVER to bring our check. At this point we were done with our food and starting to get cold. She finally comes over with it and my husband puts a card in. He goes to look at the check one more time and she is walking over, but then sees this and walks away.

Even showing up at 11:10 made no difference as the desk took my name and told me it would be 5-10 minutes to be seated!   Management is permitting customers to wait rather than requiring their staff to be on site and ready on time.

The Pleasanton location on the backside of the Stoneridge Mall is always busy. Its been a while since I have been back because of the long wait times and inexperienced hosts. This time my partner and I came early but still were told to wait for about 8 minutes even though there were plenty of empty tables. The menu is huge literally a book and always has some thing I feel like having. This time I ordered the meatloaf and it was very good. It came in three thick slices with mash potatoes and a corn succatash.  Plenty of parking in the mall parking lot. Service is hit or miss with the initial interaction with the hostess podium.

I started going back to this location, on cause the waitress there that helps me is really good at her job. When I go into CF, I always get the same thing. This time I wanted to try something else.( Big Mistake ) I tried the Fish & Chips! I was pumped when it came out. It looked great! I soon come to find out that the fish wasn't cooked right. The small pieces were great, but the big pieces were mushy & falling apart. I couldn't tell if it was under cooked or old. I'm very, very disappointed in CF for this. love this place! What's not to love? The only problem is the service is very inconsistent. Sometimes I come in and the service is top notch. You never have to ask for refills, they bring bread right to your table, they seem genuinely happy that you sat in there section. But today was the total oppose of good customer service. I sat down in what looked to be a slow section, so I was very surprised that it took my waitress quite awhile to greet me and ask what I would like to drink. She then brought my drink over and then took off without asking me if I was ready to order. She then came back ask me for my order then took off. Never refilling my drink or bring over any bread. It's not really a big deal, but when I go out to eat, I want it to be a smooth transition. I don't want to have to ask for anything. Just for the record, this was durning the off hours, around 2:15 in the afternoon.  Anyways, my meal finally came and it was great. The food is always great at Cheesecake, yet their service is going down hill and fast.  When I returned to work, I shared my experience with a few of my co workers and they confirmed that the service isn't very desirable.

I was feeling really thankful to her for remembering me and doing that for me even though they had to handle a bunch of orders (When my cake was ready, I was out of her sight to pick up  phone for several minutes, so she had to call my name repeatedly.

Well the sauce is key to this dish. The sauce was not right at all, it was thin  and lacked the flavor that this dish usually has. The best way to describe the sauce would be that it was not reduced properly.  The next issue was that my daughter order which was a simple fettuccine and Alfredo it came with bow tie pasta, we specifically ordered fettuccine pasta, after waiting another 40minutes for our food originally her plate came out with bow tie pasta. We had to send it back and my daughter by this time is getting tired and hungry. We now are waiting another 30minutes. Her pasta comes out this time with what looks like a whole bottle of Alfredo sauce without any flavor what so ever. My daughter who is 7  says ""this isn't good mommy "".  I asked to speak with the manager and waited another 20minutes before she came out to say that she would remove the pasta from our bill.

249,Brandy B.,"Columbia, SC",172,132,802.0,1.0,2016-09-23,"Worst Cheesecake Factory experience ever...  Who goes to The Cheesecake Factory when visiting a new city?!!?!!  This was suggested by my friends -  I obliged. (#fail). I don't know if everything was heightened because I'd been awake since 3:30am EST and was starving or what because I was pretty delusional and numb by the time this ""dining"" experience was over. I've only been to The Cheesecake Factory in Charlotte NC numerous times so I thought I'd know what to expect - we waited 25mins for a table for 4 (which is exactly the wait time the hostess quoted us, so no biggie), our buzzer goes off we give it to the host, he has us stand and wait for another hostess to seat us... we wait 5 more minutes. We get sat at a nice round booth table (party of 4) so it's really spacious - and the seats are disgustingly dirty, like no one has ever climbed in to clean the back part of the booth. My son isn't one to complain but he was super thirsty - we waited 10 mins for the server to greet us before going to wash our hands and look for a water fountain or something (he never came) - we went to the bathroom came back, he still never came, we sat and sat and sat and THEN he showed his face to welcome us and state that he'd return shortly... 10 minutes later he appears, we're ready to order EVERYTHING.  So we waited ~30 mins for drinks!!!!!!!!! He comes back 10 mins later with our waters and two sodas, and another 2 mins later with my friends drink. Our app arrives maybe 5 mins after the last drink...loaded baked potato bites were delicious (only positive about the meal)... then we sit and sit and sit and sit - 20 mins after the app, my friends' dishes arrive, hers is wrong, the server doesn't come over to let me know our (my son and I) food will be out shortly for another 10 mins after their dishes had arrived, at that point she tells him it's not what she ordered, I ask for my son's food in a to-go box because he is now sleeping on my lap. My son and I wait another 15 mins before our server appears with our food (he forgot my sons fries and my extra ranch).  They order cheesecakes then (because we know that'll take another hour) and request the check.  He brings back the correct food for her within 5 mins (which was odd - due to the previous wait time and supposed ""back up"" in the kitchen). My crispy shrimp sandwich was disgusting - the shrimp was rubbery - the salad was nothing life saving either. At this point I'm too weak and tired to care or complain, I just wanna get some fuel and get the heck out! My friends fiancé was the only one who enjoyed his meal. The server never apologized for the extreme dysfunction, never took notice to the fact that i only took two bites of the sandwich and one fork full of the salad - never invited the manager over to make things right or at least show that they cared.   In Charlotte, wait times can be up to 3hrs (but once you're sat it's pretty much smooth sailing from there).  I thought a 25min wait time was amazing and this place was far less crowded than Charlotte - boy was a wrong. It was BAD - and I'm happy it's over!!!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pleasanton?start=280,1.64,2.12,2.268,1.924,1.928

209,Heather M.,"Livermore, CA",5,4,,5.0,2016-09-26,"I'm kind of puzzled by the 1 and 2 star reviews this location is getting - my boyfriend and I went for lunch on Sunday around 1 pm and waited about 20 minutes for a table, exactly on point with what the nice hostess told us. The wait was reasonable, as this location is perpetually busy. We decided to use our wait time to check out the neat menu slides on the televisions above the cheesecake counter. It helped expedite our service too, figuring out what we were hungry for in advance.  We were seated promptly after and brought our drinks without delay. Our server was very friendly and kept up very gracefully with the flow of her tables.  Props to her!!We never felt neglected despite the crowd. I believe her name was Alyssa? Anyway she was a total boss. I feel like a jerk for not remembering her name but also I was like on a rapturous mashed potato journey in my mouth, so. Pleasantly distracted.   But yeah, on to the aforementioned rapture: food was great - stuffed mushroom appetizer was totally delicious. I had the herb crusted salmon and bf had the chicken di pana. Portions are very generous! We had to take the rest of our meals home and get our cheesecake slices to go.  Again, the flow of service was really spot on when we went, despite how crazy busy it was. I think generally the disgruntlements detailed by the reviews here might be mitigated by a little patience, knowledge and preparation for how one's brain operates during a calorie deficit (grumpy babies much?? And I'm not talking about the children...) and understanding that Cheesecake Factory basically operates at rush hours at all hours. The food is great and definitely worth the (very reasonable) wait in my opinion, and also, there's a full bar. Who doesn't love a full bar? Have a cocktail. Calm down. Enjoy life. Be nice to the waitstaff because they are busting tail to get everything done for you. Your food will taste better without all that entitled impatient vitriol in your mouth, trust me on this! Anyway, fantastic food, exceptional service amidst peak flow of customers, and tasty tasty cheesecake. Also, the bathrooms are spotless.

The boyfriend and I decided to eat here last minute before heading into the mall, because we were both super hungry. Not the greatest plan, but the individual at the front said the wait would only be 20-25 minutes. Although it took us 30 minutes to get seated, which isn't bad for an extremely busy Saturday afternoon, it took another 30 minutes or so to be served our meal. We were basically at Cheesecake for a good hour and a half, but we only spent about 20 minutes of that time eating. Take away message; if you don't have a busy day or any major plans AND don't mind waiting AND you are craving Cheesecake food that badly, then Cheesecake is the way to go. PS: There's also lines at the restroom, yay! Food was okay, it's your typical Cheesecake food. My boyfriend and I ordered from the lunch menu, which I think you get the most bang for your buck. He got the Orange Chicken and I got the Luau Salad, both of which are generous in portion size. For dessert, we shared the Dulce de Leche Cheesecake. It was good, but after a few bites I was done. It was way too sweet. Overall, the food is fine. Service was better. Our server, Gigi was attentive, really chill, and she hooked us up with the bread (we were so hungry). My experience here wasn't horrible, but it wasn't amazing either. Very time consuming, but I think that applies to most if not all Cheesecake Factory locations, especially during the weekends. I hate to admit it, but Cheesecake will forever have a place in my heart. Although it's not the best restaurant ever, it does bring back some nostalgic memories from high school days.

We asked a few questions about our appetizers and a soup our waiter made a few jokes about it and even told us if we didn't like the soup that evening he would take it off the bill.. after a long wait our order was taken, not once did he come check on us or even ask if we wanted anything else to drink after our glasses were emptied. About 25minutes after our order was taken, our appetizers and our soup never came out. Only our main dishes made it to our table and the quality that evening was really not that good, Under seasoned and lacking. When we asked about it with a server who dropped off our food, our waiter came to us to speak about the matter. He flat out lied to our faces and asked that ""we ordered appetizers?"". Well ummm yeah we had a full on conversation about it and you even joked a lil about another dish.

I am extremely shocked by the rudeness of our host. I was so angry, I do not think I will be back here anymore ever again.

Walked in and went straight to the counter. The only girl behind was busy at work but in the 10min I stood there didn't acknowledge me at all until I interrupted her asking if there was anyone else and she replied I needed to wait for the cashier. All the while there is anywhere from 2-3 servers standing, waiting on the side for orders from her.  Cashier finally shows up and she's very pleasant. She begins to help a woman standing near the register when I again interrupt and inform her that I was first in line. She takes my order but then it's another 15min before I get it. REALLY???? At about the 10min mark I ask the host if there was a mgr I could speak with cause the wait was ridiculous. He says of course. He goes then returns and says the mgr will be right with me. I finally get my order but no mgr still. I wait a few more minutes then ask the host if the mgr was on their way? He replies and points to a woman walking away ""oh that was her."" I ask if he told her I was waiting to speak with her he says yes. I ask does she just not care and he replies ""I don't know you have to ask her."" My reaction: WTF??? She's now talking to someone and he goes over to them and the man instead of the woman comes over and asks if he can help me. I recount my experience and how ridiculous it is that I had to wait half an hour for 2 slices of cheesecake and then another 10min to talk to a mgr about it. His reply ""well I just walked in the door.""  Yeah these (bleeps) wasted my time. I get to the car to discover they did my order wrong too.

I thought  for sure The Cheesecake Factory wouldn't disappoint me or let me down. WRONG! I called on November 7 around 2:30 pm. The phone was ringing for a long time and I thought...wow; man they must really busy. When someone finally answered I was put on hold. I didn't mind but after 20 minutes of holding I hung up and called back. I thought maybe they forgot there was a call on hold. When I called the second time and when someone answered after another delayed answer I immediately said I want to place an order for a cake. They said ok can you please hold and I said ok. AGAIN The Cheesecake Factory had me on hold again. After 15 mins I hung up again. I said to myself; there's no way they can be this busy on a Monday at 2:30 in the afternoon... just to place an order for a cake...WTF! So I called a third time and someone picked up right away maybe because they knew or remembered someone was holding on he phone. When they answered I said to that person that this is my third time calling and I've been trying to place an order for a while  and it's for a birthday. I could not believe they put me on hold AGAIN and no one answered after 10 mins! I Could not believe this! So I called over to the Walnut Creek location to put in a order for a cake which is 20 mins away from where I live. When I called this location they answered on the first ring, transferred my call to the right person so I could put my order in; they took my order and I gave them specific details for the cake. I informed them that this cake needs to be picked up Friday November 11 @ 4:00pm. I was so upset when a guest of the party told me that the cake was not ready at 4pm and that there was no order placed and no one knew about it. So my guest who I designated to pick up the cake and set up for the surprise party was extremely late and showed up after the celebrant was all because the guest had to wait 45 mins for the SLOPPY birthday greeting on the $57 cake to get prepared. Then fight through traffic to drive to Hayward to get to the party 1hour later. THANKS CHEESESCAKE FACTORY for showing a loyal patron of your restaurant service like this! I'll never attempt or spend my money at your establishment again. I'll more than likely not even accept an Cheesecake Factory gift card as a gift.

I sent it back and I left. 3rd time I just went to get cheesecake. 3 slices that are not made on the premise that came to 27 dollars. I get home and they all taste off. Like they have been frozen and thawed way too many times and they all resemble the same flavor. Like when you go to a restaurant and get a coke and it has the diet coke, 7up, every soda combo.

We were given a menu, and ordered drinks which took a long time, but she explained the transition of switching staff due to their shift ending. We received our appetizer first. We devoured it along with the breads. Asked for water and received it in a short time. Our drinks slowly made it to our table along with the main course. We had a mistake in our whole cheesecake to go, but no problem. We asked for a smaller size cheesecake, and they corrected the bill. One of the male waiter brought the Lg red velvet cheesecake, but I canceled it, coz my family prefer the original instead. He politely took it back, and our waitress brought the small original cheesecake which my family loves. Overall, our dinner experience was exceptional. The wait was long, but well worth it.

Their fried mac & cheese balls are my favorite thing to order here!  Service is always on top!

From getting seated to the food quality to getting drink refills, I can say that there was nothing that was acceptable. We asked for bar seating. Three bar tables opened up. They sat, dirty, for at least five minutes. After they were clean, that sat clean for ten minutes. After staring at the three clean tables for ten, minutes, they seated us. And there we sat...and sat...and sat. Finally, someone came to the table and said, ""Is there something I can get you?"" There was no, ""Hi. I'll be your server tonight."" He seemed as if he noticed we were there for a while and was seeing if we had been served yet. I told him that we needed a server. He asked what he could get us. It was a very strange encounter. So, we ordered. And waited....and waited....and waited. About 25 minutes later, our ""nachos"" arrived. I guess they've abandoned the concept of cheese almost entirely. The ""cheese"" was this gloppy, gritty, pasty cheese sauce with a few sprinkles of real cheese on top. They were awful. I'd say it was canned cheese, but that would be an insult to canned cheese. Our drinks were never refilled. The table next to us was having an equally terrible experience. I will not be going back to this poorly managed establishment.

We then came back up at 8:42 to see how much longer we had, thats when Cheesecake started to drop the ball. The host again told me that we still had another 30-45mins to go. I then decided that I'd like to speak to a Manger to express how much of a bummer it was that we had waited so long and how our time didn't seem to be paying off. I was never awknoledged by not only ome but two managers, one of whom kept doing what she was doing at the host stand without even looking up from her screen. At that point I was over it.

I would give this rating a negative but since yelp doesn't have that yet I would have to settle with a one. I do not understand how management allows such behaviors from  the employees. I have worked in places where it can get busy and overwhelming but the experience that happened today does not repeat itself.  It all started when one of my colleagues went to go put our name on the waiting list and the host said it would be a 45 min wait. After 45 min, they went to go check on how much longer and the host rudely said that it was going to be an hour wait and she didn't say 45 when clearly 9 of us heard. We were quite a big party so I understood if it took longer so at the 56 min mark our boss went for an update and they told her that they were cleaning the table. The thing that made me mad the most is that parties of 2, 3, and 4s where being seated while we waited there. So from waiting from 9:15 to almost 10:15 without an acknowledgment for thank you for waiting would of been fine. THEY WERENT EVEN BUSY!!!! You know how I knew because I saw waiters and hostess talking and laughing.  Once we were seated we were all extremely hungry. I heard a remark of the waiters in-charged of that section that said ""Really, I have them"" I thought that was extremely rude because since we were a big party we were going to bring a lot of money to the establishment but I was happy we didn't get the waiter that was in-charged of that section we got a nice gentleman that almost made me forget that rocky start. The food was excellent and on point.  As we were about to leave the establishment 3 colleagues heard another remark from another employee. She said ""FINALLY! Leave."" Under her breathe but to her luck 3 people heard what she said. My boss thought that the whole experience was unacceptable and wanted to talk to a manager. To top this wonderful cake the MANAGER kind of brushed it off. Now it makes sense of how the employees are so customer service inefficient if they don't have a role model to follow. To put the cherry on top that same girl that made the same remark was talking to a colleague of hers and she was just laughing and looking in our direction.  If this gets to corporate. I hope you guys re-train most of your employees on customer service and how to efficiently coordinate especially on the hostess since they are the first face we see on coming in. Also I hope there is some compensation over this horrendous experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pleasanton?start=120,2.2,2.06,2.236,2.052,2.116

This location tends to always be busy regardless of the time because of its location in Stoneridge Mall.  I went with my visiting friend today and we waited around 40 minutes for a table for two. They seemed a bit short staffed but our server did the best she could. The bread plates on table were both dirty (crusted cheese on mine) and some unknown brown thing on hers. Our server immediately replaced them with new plates when she brought our bread and drink order.  The saving grace for today was my miso salmon and the pink lemonade. I substituted the rice with their fluffy mashed potatoes.  The glaze was a little burnt but I still loved it. The salmon was juicy and the mashed potatoes were soft and well seasoned.

468,Mina K.,"Little River, CA",0,3,,1.0,2016-12-28,"I was in the service industry for 6 years, waiting tables in restaurants and bars. Never in my career have I seen so much neglect and laziness. I went with my mother last night she is a senior with type 2 diabetes. We were greeted with a very sweet and kind front desk hostess who took the time that night to do her makeup, nice eyes with silver lining. She called us when table was ready. We had to wait standing up as every time the door opened near the waiting area we were hit with freezing cold winds. We sat down and ordered our dinners. I requested a gluten free salmon and vegetables with potato dinner and the waitress was confused and came back twice with confusing explanations of what exactly had gluten in the dinner. Was it the potatoes or the broccoli. It was the potatoes. The broccoli never came as it was stolen by another waiter supposedly. The appetizer we ordered never came and 20 minutes later she shows up and acts suprised and says "" oh, no one brought you the appetizer "" then comes back and says they don't have anymore artichoke dip. But did not offer to bring back menus for us to look at appetizers so we just didn't get an appetizer. After we were done eating our entire dinner the broccoli arrives and as she approaches our table with the plate of broccoli she stops in her tracks and holds the plate a way and realizes how late it' is and says with a disappointing look "" oh should I just bag it up to go for you "" ? My mom and I at this point thought a candid camera might be peeping around the corner.. But no this was real and not a joke. The entire time we were ignored. Our tea and hot water forgotten and not refilled. Wait was rediculous and our eyes were always fixated down the row of booths waiting and praying she will come back again. Table never once serviced or cleaned we were not taken care of at all. Our dinners came out seperately instead of all at once. We had to ask and then wait for EVERYTHING. The waiter seemed out of touch untrained lazy and slow. With an airy non caring demeanor. It was pretty much a joke. Instead of dealing with us she brought out the manager in a lazy way as if she shouldn't have to bother with her mess. This was such an amateur set up, kind of ghetto. Nothing like any chessecake factory experience we've had previously. The manager treated this as if it was no big thing and wasn't serious at all and gave 1 piece of a 1 inch pie covered in 4 inches of nasty whip cream to my diabetic mom and expected this to be the problem solver of the rediculous and annoying experience we had. I guess that's their policy, if anything goes wrong give them a piece of cheesecake and they'll shut up. My mom was shocked. Did they want us to share this 1 piece of tiny cheesecake slithered with whip cream? In my days working in this industry the manager would have apologized, given out dinner cards, and refered us to one of the top waiters they had. And definitely wouldn't give a blob of sugar to a senior with diabetes expecting to make up for their lack of basic service and neglect. If I wanted my dinner to be a mishmash of things and late to the table then I could have just STAYED HOME!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pleasanton?start=480,2.2,2.0,2.216,2.02,2.08

The wait is usually 30-45 mins if you don't have a reservation. Tip about the happy hour - you need to ask to be seated in the ""bar area"" in order to get happy hour. The nicer area with booths and big tables can't get happy hour pricing. The drinks are $5.99 for happy hour and the appetizers are also around $5-6 which is awesome. We all got 2-3 drinks and several appetizers and our bill was only $60-70! The food was pretty good but the factory nachos were a little to burnt. The avocado rolls were amazing and the tamale cakes (I think seasonal) were also amazing tasting! In all the service was great.

When our main course arrived, we were left with much to desire. My date and I both ordered the pasta carbonara, which tasted rather bland. I'm not sure if the sauce was all at the bottom or if they just barely put any on. The bacon in my dish was cooked excellently but all of my dates bacon pieces were burnt to a crisp, I kid you not. I got mine with chicken in it and even that was super bland. We would have sent it back but at that point we were pretty starved and there was no way we would have been able to stop eating and wait for a new dish even if it wasn't that good.

They are always fast and efficient! Although during busy hours it might take a while to get their attention but they will definitely get the job done. I've eaten a couple of their cheesecakes and man they are the best!! I have a huge sweet tooth and the cheesecake is usually a have to have in this place! Sometimes I will be full from the bread and main course so I won't have room for cheesecake but I recommend the Oreo cheesecake! It's my favorite!

111,Erika C.,"San Jose, CA",0,45,20.0,2.0,2017-02-18,"The only reason I revisited this location was because my brother forgot the names of every other restaurant. We arrived after lunch hour was over. The restaurant wasn't very packed, and we waited about 20 minutes. This time the ladies at the front were much more friendly. So, a bonus star for that. After we were seated, we were given menus and we actually waited quite a while for our server to return. It took about ten minutes, and the restaurant wasn't even busy. Bread and water took five more minutes. Our order took more than half an hour to arrive. We were just watching people seated after us getting their food before us. I was debating leaving, but our waiter came back around after serving another table, and assured us that our food was almost ready. It didn't come out for another ten minutes.  I ordered the herb crusted salmon fillet from the lunch menu, since I'd seen it on the display while I was waiting. When it arrived, it didn't really look like the picture. I understand that items from the lunch menu are smaller than the dinner menu because they are cheaper, and it's meant for lunch, but only four pieces of asparagus? Come on, I paid over 15 bucks for that dish. It also looked like it'd been out for a while because the white sauce at the bottom had formed a film on top. The salmon was okay. It was cooked to my liking, but the herbs did nothing. It was like the salmon was steamed, and it was so bland.  The best part of the dish was honestly the mashed potatoes. I'm not a food critic, and I probably have less taste buds than the average human, and this dish did not impress. I've been coming to this location for many years now, and the quality has dropped significantly in the past few years. In my last post, the hostess was super snappy and rude, rolled her eyes at me, and pushed me down the wait list. We didn't even stick around to eat. I read the apology from the restaurant, but you should do better than that. I absolutely hate when I get my food later than someone who orders their dish twenty minutes after me. Fish does not take that long to cook. I've been to other locations where the servers even offered us a ten dollar discount for no particular reason. I read the most recent review where someone was offered free cheesecake and supplied with plenty of bread because her order took a bit longer. I didn't get any of that, and the restaurant wasn't even busy. There were so many empty tables around us.  I hope no one else has the same crappy experience as us.

As for cheesecake I ordered their new nutella drizzled cheesecake and it was DELICIOUS! Words cannot express how amazing it was. I was already full and if I wasn't full I would have gotten my own slice. Instead I shared it with my sister. It literally tasted like the ferrero rocher chocolate. It was rich and sweet.

It upsets me because I normally LOVE Cheesecake Factory; just not this location. I decided to take my sister here for her birthday and I told her we need to get there early because it gets busy (and I didn't want to wait in traffic). So we got there at 5. The wait was actually the smoothest part of the night. We waited about 2 minutes before we were seated. We were STARVING so I was looking forward to the bread. Well, 15+ minutes go by and no one has come over to help us. Like, at all. Eventually, our server comes over and greeted us with his suuuuuper friendly personality (which is absolutely great for others. But I was just not in the mood at this point). We were ready to order so I got us the Fire-Roasted Artichoke and Crispy Fried Cheese for apps, our entrees and drinks. I also let him know we were here celebrating my sisters birthday (CLUE). A little while after our server put our order in, he comes back with the drinks and says ""I'm really sorry but we're out of the artichokes."" I was kinda bummed because I was looking forward to that, but not to worry, we still got the best app coming (the ""cheese sticks""). These are LITERALLY my favorite appetizer in the world because they are very similar to the cheese sticks at Macaroni Grill.  I'd say another 10+ minutes go by, he comes back. ""So I was just told by a coworker that we're actually out of the Crispy Fried Cheese too.."" HOLD UP, WHAT?! That made me SO sad because my sister never had them before and we were both looking forward to that. My attitude totally changed at this point because, what the hell. How do you run out of that?? UGH. He tried asking us if we wanted anything else and seriously at this point, I wanted to leave. So we said no, its fine. CLEARLY upset and he should've noticed that. So the entrees come out and its whatever. Normal burger and a humongous fried chicken sandwich. I asked my sister if she wanted cheesecake (because I THOUGHT they might bring her a cheesecake for her birthday like they normally do). We order the cheesecakes and I also ask him to bring a jar of their ranch, which they sell up at the front near the cheesecakes. This guy goes ""well I need to get a manager with the key and blah blah blah."" I was like, ""Dude they are at the front. You can't just bring one up?"" I've never had this happen in the past. Eventually he comes back with an empty jar and goes ""so I'm gunna have to fill one of these up with the ranch from the back."" Do whatever you have to do because at this point, we've been here for TWO HOURS. TWO FREAKING HOURS for TWO PEOPLE. He comes back with jar with the weirdest handwritten label that just looked super sketch. My face looks upset and angry and this all should have been a clue. I wanted to talk to the manager but I also wanted to get the hell out of there. He gives us the check and I was hoping for some sort of discount or SOMETHING. Anything to try to make it up to us after this horrible experience. Butttt no. Nothing. I was PISSED. So I just paid and he comes to get the check and says ""hope you had a nice time here."" And I said ""no, we did not. We did not have a good time at all."" He stood there SHOCKED. ""Oh really? You didn't have a good time?"" I looked at him like WHAT?! How did you not know, dude. I said ""no, and it's disappointing that you couldn't help us out. But we're ready to leave. We've been here for way too long."" This just made me laugh and look at him crazy, he said ""Oh I'm so sorry. You should come back on the weekend."" ARE YOU SERIOUS?

We waited 40 minutes to get seated, which isn't that bad considering there's always a lot of people there. When we sat down our server didn't even come to greet herself or himself. We flagged someone down after sitting there for 20 minutes, and then come to find out she was our server. Her name was Andrea. She asked us what we needed and I mentioned we'd like to order. She abruptly asked one of my sisters what they wanted to order. Didn't apologize for not getting helped or nothing. Her response was, what do you want, and abruptly tried to go through everyone on my table. Then as she was done taking our order she was leaving and we flagged her down again because she didn't even ask us what we wanted to drink. She took that down and left. Almost 15 minutes later we asked if we could at least have bread. And she came back 7 minutes later with bread but we had no utensils or plates so we asked for some. We somehow ate our bread with butter with no utensils. Our drinks came shortly after that but she still didn't bring us utensils. Our food came almost 40 minutes after ordering however we didn't get our appetizer! When we were done with our meal she mentioned they were still making our calamari...and we asked to cancel the order. She came back stating oh we already cancelled that for you. Ummmmm how are you going to cancel our calamari when we didn't even ask you to???? And not bother even telling us? Quickly after that, we asked for the check which came out in like a minute after asking for it. That's probably the only thing they did rt we're assuming! Quick to get you out and pay for your food! We checked our bill.... and whattya know? Calamari is still being charged. This took another 20 minutes to get taken off!!!! Never again. By the worst Cheesecake Factory ever.

Egg rolls were soggy and calamari were not crunchy, seemed like they had been sitting on the side for a long time. For main course, we ordered steak Dianne, medium rare, chicken Marsala, and bang bang chicken and shrimp. Steak was cook much more to a well done side, so tough and chewy. Chicken was also overcooked, it was so dry and rubbery. For the chicken and shrimp, the peanut/curry sauce was so salty!  When we told about the situation to our server, she just replied ""that's how we always cooked our food and no one complaint!"" I'm so lost for words. Re train all your employees even your cooks. What a disaster! Not worth waiting for 30mins of my time and $$!! Waiter asked if we wanted to see the dessert menu but when we were about to put in our order, everything that we wanted were out!!

It comes w/ 4 sliders about 3inches big. Cooked well good fried batter all it could use is a little sauce to elevate the taste. Over all a 4 out of 5 stars. For lunch My boyfriend ordered the Bacon Bacon Cheeseburger. It's came with smoked apple wood bacon, pork belly, American cheese & cheddar cheese , and a garlic butter sauce on a toasted bun. 4.5 out of 5 stars.  I had the BBQ Chicken Salad. IT WAS HUGE. It came w/ Grilled Chicken, cucumbers, black beans, avocados, tomatoes and fried red onions on top w/ a side of BBQ Ranch dressing. I enjoyed it but next time I'll just order a half size. 4.5 out of 5 stars.

118,Kerry R.,"Deerfield, IL",5,16,24.0,1.0,2017-04-23,"I visited this location on April 11 and although they were out of both NY Strip and Ribeye steaks I ended up having one of the best Fillet Migon steaks I have had.  The service was great and the food was awesome. On April 15th my wife flew into town to spend the holiday weekend with me (I'm in town for three weeks on business) and I was very excited to take her to the Cheese Cake factory for our Easter dinner.  After being seated I ordered a drink and was brought the wrong one.  We ordered our food and was asked if we would like bread and about twenty minutes later we finally received it.  When we went to eat the bread we noticed we didn't have any other utensils other than forks and waited several more minutes before we received butter knives at which point we shared one with the table next to us who was in the same situation.  I ordered the bone in Ribeye steak rare and when it arrived I received a medium well steak with burnt green beans on a plate that felt like it had been in an oven.  The steak I received was a scrawny boneless cut that looks like they bought it from the grocery store which makes sense since they were out of that cut of meat on my last visit.   Several minutes later my wife received her food and immediately noted the rather row rice they served her.  At this point I mentioned to steak and green beans to the waiter and he sent the manager over to speak with me.  The manager proceeded to pass the plate's extreme heat off as an effect of being under a heat lamp and tried to pass off my medium well steak I ordered rare as copacetic.  Eventually the manager offered to cook me another rare steak and when I received it it was refrigerate cold and looked as if it had spent about 10 seconds on the grill.  The steak was seriously cooked less than tartar, it was basically freaking raw and once again there was the burnt green beans.   Needless to say this was one of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever encountered.  Even though I had a terrible Easter dinner I was willing to still visit a Cheesecake Factory again but after I wrote their customer service department online I never even received so much as a canned email response from them.  This company apparently does not care if you enjoyed your meal and could care even less about the lack of professionalism the manager displayed. The floor in the restaurant was also so greasy you could slide from one end to the other with a little effort. I not only won't be visiting this Cheesecake Factory I won't be visiting any Cheesecake factory, PF Chang's or any other restaurant this company operates.  The lack of customer care and professionalism is bewildering.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pleasanton?start=160,2.56,2.26,2.24,1.5400000000000003,2.38
56,Lisa S.,"Hayward, CA",0,5,,1.0,2017-04-28,"Because of the incompetent people that work here, we were not able to enjoy a nice dinner with our sister who is in the military before she returned to Korea. This was the worst restaurant experience we have ever had. The night ended with us being chased down in the parking lot by 2 managers accusing us of walking out on the bill.   We got there at 6:45 pm and was told that it would be about a 30 minute wait, they gave us a pager and we sat down. They paged us, went to seat us then told us that it was a mistake, escorted us back to the waiting area and had us waiting longer. We were finally seated and the poor customer service continued. Our orders were taken and the manager offered us a free appetizer which we appreciated but by 9:00 pm we still had not received our food. People who came in after us were already eating so we told the waiter to cancel our orders and left since we lost our appetites and had enough of the BS. The only items we received at this point were 4 waters and a coke, the waiter did not stop us and tell us we had a bill. When we got to our car we were bombarded by both managers, one proceeded to take a picture of our license plate and told us that the police and mall security were on their way. She accused us of walking out on our bill and running away from them when we saw them coming. Mind you, I had my five month old baby in my arms sleeping and we were not walking together as a group since my husband walked ahead to get the car seat in first, we had no idea they were coming behind us. We told her that we didn't even have any of the food we ordered and she yelled at us ""you guys had alcoholic drinks!"" We told her we did not have any alcoholic drinks and she continued to accuse us of having some and said there was a Georgia peach on the table. She obviously had no idea what was going on. We explained to her the situation and then she tried to offer us the food for free but we declined, we just wanted to leave at that point and grab a quick bite. I did not appreciate her escalating the situation and being hostile with kids around.

200,Victor V.,"Hayward, CA",0,1,,1.0,2017-04-28,"Thursday April 27th 2017 - We arrived at the cheesecake factory around 6:45pm yesterday and proceeded to reserve a table. After waiting 30 minutes we were called up and they proceeded to take us to the back corner just to find out that all the tables were full and they had made a mistake. They called it a false update. We walked all the way back to the receptionist just to find out that our waiting seats were already taken. We stood up for another 15-20 mins with a toddler in the middle of the restaurant before they could clean out another table. We finally got our table but the waiter took another 15 minutes before taking down our drink order. 15 minutes later we received our bread but no water. The water came another 15 minutes later after we all had dry mouths from the bread. It could have been 10 minutes but our waiter decided to have a 5 minute conversation with the next table for whatever reason. At that point we were offered a free appetizer for the mistake they had made earlier with our table. We accepted and ordered nachos. We then placed our order of food just to have the waiter come out 10 minutes later and tell us that they didn't have one of the items in stock. After waiting another 45mins to an hour we started get frustrated. It took 3 people to tell us that our food was coming out soon. Obviously there was something wrong with our order. After all the ""false updates""  we received I told our waiter that we were canceling the order. I walked back to our table and we began to leave. At no point did they tell us we had an outstanding bill and the waiter let us leave. We walked out the door and walked to the car. All of a sudden 2 manager level employees ran to our car and accused us of walking out on the bill. It was a short fat Caucasian lady and a tall Caucasian man They accused us of stealing alcoholic beverages when all we ordered was 4 waters and a coke. Obviously they did not know what was going on in their own work place. I mean what the hell is a Georgia peach anyways? They took pictures of our license plate and told us the cops were on the way. I am disgusted to highest degree that this even happened. They even said that we ran from them with a 5 month old baby in our arms. After i told them that all we ordered was a coke I gave the short manager lady 20 dollars and she put it in her pocket. After realizing the mistake they had made she offered my money back but i said no. Keep it. We asked them if they wanted us to stay for the police but they said no. She said the coke is only 3 dollars so here is your $20 back and my brother took it. It was so bad that my brother is seeking legal advice for the harassment we received. This was supposed to be the last dinner before my sister flies back to South Korea for 1 year to her army base. By the time we left all the other restaurants were already closed. We settled for Tapioca Express yesterday night. I am not a active Yelper but the unforgivable service and accusations we received yesterday has led me to this post. I will be an active yelper going forward in order to inform the world of  the horrendous service that these restaurants provide. As i am typing there are multiple 1 star reviews to right of me so i am glad i am not the only one that see's the truth.

Our server arrives I ask him about the fryers he said he had to check with kitchen. When he comes back he said that yes they are safe and fried separately. Great so I order burger GF bun and fries. Simple enough right? So after about 20 mins he comes over to tell me that he is going on break and introduced our new server. She comes back 10 mins later and tells me that the fries are safe and being cooked separately. I never mentioned this to her but I was glad she knew what was up. ANOTHER 30 mins goes by. So now it's been an hour since ordering. At this point the manager comes over and says that they can't make the fries separately and that they never do. I let him know that 3 people told me otherwise and it is marked GF on their menu. He apologizes and offers me a side salad instead. I say ok cause we were starving and annoyed.

It is a very busy location,this area in particular, is always busy when dining out!! Annoying. Yes. Anyway- what is confusing is why they like to sit everyone in a row on those bench like tables elbow to elbow? Weird to me.We just ask for a booth when not in the mood to share dinner convos.! There's usually enough seating elsewhere but they like to cram everyone together like cows at a feeding trough..lol (We only go for early dinners as to avoid the crowds). Today waitress was great,bread was served promptly (I was surprised),drinks came fast and dinner was fine...Salads were wilted though.The cheesecake was underwhelming. It just didn't have the same rich dense taste I was used to.Tasted like whipped cheesecake,I don't know it was weird. And small.Portions used to be bigger...

Next thing we know she passes by and tells us ""I'm so sorry that your food is not here...my manager will be by to speak with you.""    Ten or fifteen minutes pass and the manager arrives and apologizes and states ""we're going to pay for your main dishes that you ordered...they should be arriving in less than 10 minutes.""     So, should I call ""BS"" now or just state that the given promise of the manager was an all out lie. Well, both then! Almost 25 minutes elapsed and our so-called ""lunch"" was served to us closer to 4:30pm. We didn't even finish the food due to the fact that it was tepid, not hot but tepid, like luke warm water. The weather outside was hotter than the food bought to our table.       Suffice to say, this was the worst Cheesecake Factory experience we've ever had.       It will be a while until we come back to eat at CF.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pleasanton?start=80,1.8,2.18,2.144,1.7320000000000002,2.028

We were only a party of 3 and we were seated right away and the best part we were seated at a booth. But, after being seated that's when waiting for seemed like forever started. The person that said that our server will be here right away didn't arrive right away. So we waited for about 10 mins before our server got to our table. And it wasn't busy yet so i don't get why it so long to even ask what we'd like to drink and give our complimentary bread. Even the drinks and bread took awhile to be given to us. We decided to not get appetizers and just get main entrees because who knows what how long that will take. So we just ordered what we wanted at the same time she asked for our drinks.

Came on 7/4 which is a holiday so maybe that could be the reason for such poor service, But our server (did not get her name because she never introduced herself) who was very sweet just could not keep up. We were sat in the bar area and it was painful watching our server apologizing to our surrounding tables. It was just busy and I don't think the hosts were seating with enough of a grace period for her to fully catch up. When we were sat another table next to us was also sat in her section & I overheard her taking the drink order for the table just right next to us. Understanding that it was really busy we just waited with no complaint until she finally got to us but unfortunately she never did, after 20 minutes she sent over her manager (who I think should have done more to help her really, like buss tables, refilled drinks, etc) he apologized for the wait and told us he was just starting us until she could get around to coming over. When we finally order he said we had just missed Happy Hour, I looked at my phone and it was now 6:06. After explaining our long wait to the manager he honored the happy our price, we ordered our food and then waited another 30 for the food to come out.  The server apologized over and over then began to blame the kitchen. I guess my overall reason for this post is YOU GUYS ARE A TEAM!   The host failed the server then, the manager failed the server by not providing enough follow up, & last the server failed the kitchen by bad mouthing them.

One of the appetizers come out   And yet we are still waiting on the other appetizer and we don't have waters or small plates to share the food with. We stop one of the servers, she is flustered and says I need to go get a check before I help you...(wtf) she comes back and grabs us some plates finally! We get the manager and all he has is excuses.. while he is sitting at our table (by the way who invited you to sit down) the server brings out the second app and the to go food!

I ask her to place all the food order at the Same time so it comes out together.. she stated if I place it now it will take about 20 minutes. I said place it in 10 min.. ask I'm walking back to the table guess what?! Our food is there.. my food tasted like a frozen meal from the freezer isle of Safeway (orange chicken) it was cold, my sister ordered lettuce wrapped burger with nothing on it and she got a fully loaded burger and my friends rice was undercooked and no flavor. We took one bite of the food and placed it at the end of the table. Our server walked by 4 times and did not stop to see what the issue was... at this point we asked for the manager & we are not happy.. my sister proceeds to show her frustration and states ""this is bullshit and now I'm pissed"" the manager tells her she needs to watch her mouth... oh so let's piss us off even more by Chastising us . We tell him we don't want the food remade and what do you know all of 15 min later here comes my boyfriends food. When she said it would take at least 30 min.. i ask him to put it under a heat lamp. He asks us what he can do and we tell him he needs to take care of the bill at this point. He proceeds to charge us $63 and then has the nerve not to being the Togo food because we said we wanted him to take care of the bill. At this point I'm pissed, he has ruined my birthday. I have not had any dinner and I went off on him. I asked for the regional managers number but do you think he ever came back to the table?! Nope. Horrible horrible horrible, this location is a disgrace to the brand Cheesecake Factory. We should have went to Walnut Creek !

After 40 minutes, she approached me and offered us a seat outside in the sun because there were no umbrellas available. It was 100 degrees out so we opted out for sitting outside, labika said it would be an additional 40 minute wait. When i explained that we had been waiting 40 minutes already. She corrected me by saying that I had only been there 13 minutes. My husband corrected her by telling her that we had been there 40 minutes. Then she said that she was not the original person that helped us and would need to go Check with the other hostess. When we told her she was the one that helped us she was flustered. there are 2 girls to choose from at the front and its not hard to mistake them, she said she had to talk to a manager...I overhear her telling him that we have only been there 13 minutes and i was being difficult. I stepped in and explained that we have now been there for 45 minutes, not 13...and that she doesn't have her facts straight. She then proceeded to tell me i was wrong again. While we were standing around waiting, the manager had even addressed us with a hi and Thank you for coming in after we had been waiting 25 minutes, so he knew we were waiting longer than she insisted on.   It seems that since she never asked my name, she assumed that it was Jared. My name is Rose..yes I am a girl! She then wanted to argue that I told her my name was Jared...dear girl, you never asked my name, if you did i would have told you rose, I can even show you Id in 4 different types. But thank you for assuming i am a boy. I do look like a girl with boobs, makeup and hair done! Yet, you continue to treat me like a was lying. The manager found my name Rose and stated that we checked in 47 minutes ago...When i looked at her for an apology,  the manager said that it was not necessary. Way to back up your lying employees. She was caught in numerous lies yet he backed her up and not even offered an apology to me. This is by far horrible customer service. If You made a mistake, as people do, own up to it. Don't continue to harass the customer to try to cover your tracks. I am so glad that this happened because I WILL NEVER RETURN TO YOUR RESTAURANT. This happened at approximately 6:40pm July 22nd.  This is by far the worst lying job from employees to customers I have seen in a long time. And what a horrible manager to have such a cocky attitude towards the customer when it was evident that your employee is a liar!! He was even able to tell me i waited 47 minutes not the 13 his employee continued to state. Bad bad bad manager and employee!! See ya cuz I will never be back!!! Buy really just want to say Thanks!

I've been a server in many different restaurants for over 4 years so I understand how stressful busy nights can be, that being said, that is no excuse for how terrible our service was.  We arrived around 8 and was quoted 30 min for a wait for 2 of us, which is fine. We waiting almost 40 min, also totally fine.  After we got sat and about 10 min of not being greeted, I stopped a server to ask if he could find ours. He rolled his eyes and walked off, nobody came.  A total of 20 min goes by and I stopped somebody to get me a manager. The manager comes over, apologizes takes our order and I let him know the guest next to us was waiting almost as long so he takes theirs as well.  When bread was brought to our table my boyfriend asked for a dr. Pepper and was brought a Diet Coke 10 min later by someone else.  About 20 after we ordered the table next to us got their food. We waited about another 20 min before we just got up and left. We were sitting at our table for over an hour and never once had a server. I have been to many different Cheesecake factories and never had this horrible of service. I've never once complained to a manager or walked out before my food arrived.

The server took almost 10 minutes to come by to take our drink order and another 10 minutes to bring us a kids menu. On to the food: Blood orange Mojito: really sweet and weak. Skinny Long Island: not sure what made it ""skinny"" but it tasted like artificial sweetener and had barely and ice- i didn't enjoy it :( Little side salad: Mixed greens with vinaigrette- fresh and satisfying. Kale salad: really fresh and was enjoyed  Kids Pasta with Marinara- Huge portion (enough for an adult and a half) My son enjoyed it. Jamaican jerk shrimp- this is my favorite item on the menu and it was good as always- highly recommend.  The server asked the order in which we wanted the food but it didn't matter as all of it came out at the same time. At one point we asked for salt and pepper and the server, after 10 mins, still had not returned. I grabbed some off of another table & when he finally came by he apologized for all the delays and said "" sorry i had to take care of some issues in the kitchen"".

I'm not sure how I haven't left a review previously, but the experience today has prompted me to do so.  We found bar seating and had to wait for 5 mins or so to have the table wiped down, but no big deal. We took a while to order but after placing our order we waited at least 45 mins for our food. It may have been longer, but at least 45. During that time we had to ask for bread after waiting around for at least 10 minutes. Then we had to separately ask for plates, table settings, and napkins.  We received no drink refills until over half way through the meal when a girl carrying a water pitcher gave me a refill. My date asked a host to see a manager and explained our wait time and experience and asked about our food. The food came out a few mins later. We rarely saw our server throughout the meal and he checked in on us zero times since taking our order. He finally showed up to collect our dishes after they had been sitting a good 10 mins. Not only did he not check in on us, we rarely saw him on the floor and had to ask other workers for the settings, bread, etc. I've been to this and other cheesecakes, but this is easily the worst service and experience ive had. Oh, the pasta dish we ordered wasn't fresh out the kitchen hot and my miso salmon had semi burned sauce in one half of the bottom of the fish. See my attached picture. I'm not sure what happened. Today was a combo of incompetent, unaware, inexperienced service, semi absurd wait time, and less than great food quality. The table in front of us and behind us seemed like they received things in a more timely manner, but we weren't keeping track of times on them. I will probably not opt to go to this location in the future, but maybe we just got a bad server.  Forgot his name, but I think it was Mike or Mark. He wasn't overtly rude or anything, he just wasn't present or really doing his job.

She blamed the delay on some kind of holiday and told us the food has been ready for awhile but that there was no one to bag it. I asked to speak with a manager.

4,Lindsay C.,"San Francisco, CA",218,176,177.0,1.0,2017-07-31,"Managed to get a seat at one of the tables in the bar and avoid the hour wait at 3:40pm ... that was the only positive thing that happened this entire dining experience.  We were greeted by our server Mike who took our drink order, food order, and brought us our drinks. He completely ignored us the entire time after that.  We had to ask multiple other wait staff if we could get bread and utensils. It was hard to catch our servers attention the few times we saw him pass by because he was always looking straight ahead after checking with in with the table behind us. He never stopped by to say anything to use or tell us our food was on the way or anything.  After about a 45 min wait I asked one of the kind wait staff to get me a manager. I explained to him the situation and told him we have been waiting a long time and our server was nowhere to be seen.  The manager then disappears and a few minutes later our food shows up... served by another server of course! Looking a bit glossed over - that look when its been sitting under the heat lamp for a little while and has been ignored just like us.  Ugh! My super pet peeve when eating out is getting food that's lukewarm. The same manager pops back up and asks how everything is. I explained to him I haven't had a chance to try it but it looks like it's been sitting out. He kind of shrugs his shoulders and disappears never to return. Doesn't offer a do-over, apologies or anything - I knew I should have asked to have our dishes cancelled and had left earlier.  Well the food was subpar - got the Bistro shrimp pasta which was - not hot and not too flavorful. I would have liked some parmesan cheese but that's too much to ask for in this restaurant. I craned my neck towards the back of the restaurant and saw 4 servers standing around talking and laughing. I was trying to catch the attention of anyone and the one server that did catch my gaze quickly turned and walked into the back. The servers here obviously don't work as a team here and that's sad because being a former server that attitude and work mentality kind of just rubs off on everyone.  My date's miso salmon had this burnt sauce taste on the bottom of the fish. At this point I just felt defeated. I rarely come to this place and it used to be such a nice treat when I do come here. This left a sour or should I say burnt sauce flavor in my mouth. I had planned to order two cheesecakes and to save myself from disappointment I just ordered the one.  After finishing most of the food and sitting around our waiter Mike finally shows up again to ask how it was. We ordered our cheesecake and 15 mins later it comes to the table.  And lastly, OMG the restroom was DISGUSTING. The first 2 stalls I walked into the were a mess. The toilet paper was off the roll holder in 2 stalls and on the floor and had stuff on roll in in both stalls. The last stall I walked into was nasty too. I told another one of the manager when I walked out of the restroom and he mentioned he would have someone go look at it. NASTY!  90 mins later I was able to finally get out of this place. I warned the next patron who wanted our table that the server is a bit slow so to be specific about everything you are asking for. She like was just glad to avoid the wait for this place. Good luck lady. What a waste of time and money!

I asked for her to give me her name.  She never apologized for the delay in service and did not even offer to comp a discount for the cheesecake.  She did not even say goodbye and have great day.  Jennifer needs to go back to customer service school.  It is her job to ensure proper customer service and she failed.  The recent reviews are pretty poor based on horrible service and I can truly see why.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pleasanton?start=200,2.0,2.09,2.168,2.02,2.0540000000000003

I picked my order up, didn't check the food as the receipt on the bag said no pine nuts. When I got home, I opened the container to find a ton of pine nuts. I called and spoke to a manager (I believe his name was Jason) who apologized and offered to credit my card and send me a gift card. Sounds nice and all but.... now it's a week later and not only did I not get credited back but I never received a gift card. I basically paid for food I couldn't eat.

She had what came off as a very poor attitude. She complained to us (and then proceeded to complain to 2 other tables that i heard) about how disorganized the set up was and that they had too many people outside for the amount of servers, which i found very unprofessional and also kind of took it as the amount of customers were inconviencing her. We then overheard her get in an arguement with another server over who's tables belonged to who, which again, was very unprofessional. Trinity apologized for the arguement however her apology seemed insincere. All in all she seemed extremely disgruntled about everything that day and made it a poor experience.

We were there with family friends, including kids, and my husband and the other husband both ordered the hibachi steak.

Which doesn't make sense, they could always just bring that on the side. Once the steaks came out, the husbands noticed that it didn't have any glaze or any sauce on the steak and the meat was extremely dry and tough. They called the waitress over and she called the manager. When he came over, he took the plates away and said they would make new ones. After waiting another 20 minutes, by this time, were were all anxious to leave, the manager came back and said they never had the hibachi steak, what they had provided to us was a different type of steak that they tried to make look like hibachi, these are his words not ours. He didn't apologize, he basically said they didn't have any hibachi steak. This was after they had waited twice for this steak. He offered us a paltry cheesecake, which we declined. At this point, we were done eating, the kids were anxious to leave, and our husbands were hungry and had to leave hungry.

We were told there was a 30 min wait and given a buzz box. We nearly missed our call for seating as the box never went off and the young woman calling out names was barely loud enough to be heard. I had ordered the Chicken Alfredo, my husband the fish. The wait for bread and our entrees were very long, close to an hour. I was told all orders are made fresh, since I had ordered pasta I conceded to wait. Our dinners finally arrive and were disappointed. The pasta was unfortunately, sticky and gummy with undercooked chicken. The sauce was like glue. My husband said the fish was decent, but had far too much breading and he did not like the tartar sauce at all. The portions are more than enough for the price.      I informed the manager of the less than palatable pasta dish, he gave a vague attempt at an apology and tried to explain how the kitchen might have overcooked or messed up the cream sauce. He offered to remove it from the bill, which I excepted as I had eaten very little of it. My husband took the left over fish home for our dogs.      Our server was wonderful, very attentive and professional, hence the two starts.     The place was very busy during our visit, music was so loud you couldn't hear each other to really carry on a decent conversation. We were seated at a table with barely enough elbow room between tables; not really a private or intimate atmosphere for an enjoyable dinner.           We did not stay for dessert as the place was too loud and crowded.

When these came out, the plate that was supposed to be shrimp+chicken did not have any shrimp. And the order with just chicken was literally half the size of the shrimp+chicken order. Not to mention, the chicken this time around was not the squarish chunk pieces they served back then. The chicken only order literally was not more than 10 small pieces and had a dry texture instead. The waiter said this is because the shrimp+chicken plate is almost twice the price. We were told they'd make it right. 30 minutes later.....nothing. And throughout this whole dining, out waiter tried to keep on getting us to order more (to up his tip I presume).

335,Irene S.,"Hayward, CA",42,172,551.0,2.0,2017-12-10,"I had a nightmare of an experience at Cheesecake Factory that really ruined not only their reputation for me but also what was supposed to be a great celebration of a 49th anniversary. We came here Saturday night at around 5pm and were told up front that they could not accommodate a reservation of more than 7 people because it was not allowed. 7 was the max that they could seat at once. WTH? I have never heard that especially seeing as how we have seated 12 here a while back. They told us that they would have to accommodate 7 on one table and the other 3 on the other table and they would try to have them nearby. So in other words, we had to split our family into 2 tables. We went for it anyways since we had already traveled to this place to celebrate. We were told our wait would be 45 mins to an hour. Pretty standard for this place but we have never really waited the full wait time. Well that wasn't our luck this time. We waited an hour and 15 mins for the table of 3 (not both our tables). Are you kidding me? The other table for 7 we waited 1 hours and 45 minutes for. In fact, we had to let the manager know to check the time on our beeper to which he said ""you guys have been waiting for 1 hour and 39 mins"" before he got the staff to work on a table for us. When our table was finally ready not only was it WAY on the other side of the first table for 3 but we passed by a group of 12 people that were seated right in front of us. So I guess they lied as to the reservation size to us since they clearly allowed other big parties in there. Even our waitress told us that she had never heard of that rule. We decided to take matters into our own hands and make room for the other 3 in our booth and were crammed in there so we can all celebrate together. At the end of it all food of course took a while to arrive and we ended up spending about 4 hours in this restaurant. Oh and need I forget to mention, they didn't even bring us any complimentary dessert to celebrate the anniversary we were celebrating. We all swore to never come here again due to the lying and lack of care the hosts and other staff showed. I would suggest if you are more than 4 people or even 2 people not to come here unless you aren't that hungry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pleasanton,2.12,2.34,2.28,2.088,2.252

He took our drinks and appetizer and brought us our drinks and appetizers after 15 mins. However, our bread did not come, as they were still in the process of baking.  The bread comes back, however we only get sourdough and didn't not receive the whole wheat bread, as we were told it would get to us. Also noted we were offered olive oil and vinegar for the bread, but that was forgotten too. 30-45 mins pass by and we get our food, cold. The food was already ready to be delivered, however it was forgotten to be taken our table. I was asked if I wanted Parmesan on my pasta and I said yes, however 15-20 mins pass by and I never got any. A few bites in, I was ready to pack up and close the check.  We figured to buy the cake at the entrance, and another mistake... instead of the coffee cheesecake I was given Chocolate cake when I was ready to devour it at home.  Overall during this 2hr dine in:  Food was still great, however served a bit cold.  Server was very sweet and nice, yet seemed like he had a long day and needed more assistance and was pacing through several tables... as we didn't receive many of the things we hoped for.

It took FOREVER to come out. The people who sat next to us and arrived after us received four entrees before we even got anything.

For your entree, you can't go wrong with anything...portions are huge and you can do family style for the best option.

We waited 1 hour to be seated which we were fine with as this is to be expected on a Saturday during the holidays. Once we were seated, we waited 10 minutes for the waitress to come by and ask if we wanted drinks.  We ordered 2 drinks, 1 burger, 1 sandwich and an appetizer all at once while we had the chance. After another 20 minutes, the waitress came by to let us know they were out of the appetizers we had asked for. Bummer, but whatever. We asked for our drinks again which she came back with shortly after. The Mojito was good but the soda was regular instead of diet. Whatever, it happens.  Waited another 40(!) minutes when the waitress came by and said the fries were still frying and would be another 10 minutes so she could bring out just the burgers.  We said we would wait the 10 minutes for everything. At this point, both parties on either side of us (who were seated after us) were already paying. They caught on and were completely shocked. One family told us they were not leaving until we got our food to see just how long this would go. 15 more minutes passed when a man from management came to tell us they put the wrong sauce on the sandwich and would need another 10 minutes. We couldn't help but laugh. After almost 2 hours from being seated, we finally got our food from a woman who introduced herself as our new waitress! It was so late, the first one had to go home at some point I guess.  The food was great. The Buffalo Chicken Sandwich did have a random black bean in it. We were not offered any discount, free dessert or sincere apology after all this.
