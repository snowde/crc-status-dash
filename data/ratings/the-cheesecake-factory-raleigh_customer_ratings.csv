139,Katherine S.,"Raleigh, NC",47,2,,5.0,2012-01-11,"My review is a little biased, as anything that has to do with cheesecake is okay in my book, but the Cheesecake Factory is one of the few fancier restaurants that has never failed to please me. I don't go enough to consider myself a regular, but I have been dining here since it first opened. I stopped in last week for lunch with a friend and was seated right away- an uncommon occurance, I realize. The hostess was consciencious of my daughter (who was in her stoller), and our server was amazing. If I could remembe his name I would totally give him a shout out. I ordered the Santa Fe salad, which was delicious, and a large enough portion that it lasted me through lunch AND take home for dinner. All in all, this is one of my favorite places! Oh, and their cheesecakes are pretty damn good too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-raleigh?start=200,3.6,3.6,3.6,3.3800000000000003,3.6000000000000005
136,Daniel M.,"Cary, NC",42,23,3.0,5.0,2012-01-18,"I've waited so long to review this place but that's because I am just not excited to review it!  I just don't think reviewing chain restaurants is as important as reviewing small businesses.  But, Yelp keeps flashing this check-in and asking me to review it so here goes.... This place is amazing!  If you haven't been to a Cheescake Factory yet I can't understand why.  I mean, they are everywhere, aren't they?   The food is absolutely delicious!  The menu could take 20 minutes to go through, they have everything. For me, spicy ahi tempura roll as an appetizer and the chicken medeira as an entree.  There is enough food here to split with your significant other (if you are not trying to eat to exhaustion) and you will still have room for any of the huge selection one-of-a-kind delicious cheesecakes!  If you like fruity adult beverages, they have a huge selection here as well. Now for the kids - the kids menu offers sliders and chicken fingers and mac & cheese and a couple other items.  It is reasonably priced and has enough food for a growing boy.  You can get a ice cream sundae for $1 more and it's enough ice cream to give your kids stomach aches (not that you'd want to, my point is it's a lot of ice cream).   The service is great!  The place ambiance is great!  The food is great! The only draw back is the huge line and wait to get a table.   I almost forgot, GO GET BRUNCH HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Monte Cristo ftw!  Mimosas for the ladies!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-raleigh?start=200,3.76,3.76,3.76,3.3800000000000003,3.76
134,Miss V.,"Dallas, TX",5,99,20.0,4.0,2012-01-28,"This place is a favorite between me and my boyfriend. It's the only place I've ever seen him order a salad, and that being said, it's one of the rare places I will order a salad either because they are typically huge, and have a whole lot of toppings that make it very filling. A few things: 1. Sometimes, the salads are made a little bit differently depending on who's the chef, which means occasionally the salads are smaller than normal, or forgot an ingredient. The servers are awesome though and typically fix what they can although when we've gotten a much smaller salad neither one of us has wanted to be the piggie that exclaimed, ""hey! MORE salad in my trough! Don't be stingy!""  I mean, they already give us two baskets of the dark bread.  2. If you get something to go, I've noticed that the to-go portions are smaller than the in-house portions. (are you noticing a trend?) I mention this because typically the salads we get are two meals worth, so when we're paying $14-16 for a salad, we like to stretch it out. 3. I can't say I've ever had anything bad here. Get creative. I typically get the pear and endive salad, and add goat cheese and beets in lieu of chicken (there's sometimes an extra charge for the cheese.) Boyfriend digs the Southwestern (or is it the Barbeque Chicken?) I'm not a big fan of their veggie burger, but I have played around with another burger and had it on their fry bread, which is messy but delicious.  4. I've ordered several of their slices of cheesecake, and while they're solid, they're not so melt-my-little-grinchy-heart that I'm willing to shell out $7 for them except when I'm feeling especially magnanimous with my stomach.  5. Oh, and their tropical iced tea is really good and enough to make me want to go there tomorrow.  6. This place might not be the best for people with hearing aids. There's most often a din of some sort, which makes it great if you're needing a public place to trade nuclear armament design upgrades, but not so great if you've had a really tough day and don't want to be surrounded by the happy, materialistic cacophony of the Mall. p.s. Dear Waitstaff-- you all rock my socks off. At all of the Cheesecake Factories I've been to in several states, I've only had the rare off night with a server and never at this one. These guys and gals are professional, warm, and for the most part efficient (c'mon, they can't control the kitchen) with presenting the food or keeping stomach grumbles to a minimum with bread and refills. Don't forget to TIP your waitstaff commensurate with the appreciation you had at having fine service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-raleigh?start=200,3.76,3.76,3.76,3.2800000000000002,3.76
101,Jenny S.,"Raleigh, NC",48,231,19.0,4.0,2012-02-14,"I've been a huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory's cheesecake ever since a friend of mine used to bring us slices at work all the time. SO TASTY!  However, I've never reviewed the restaurant itself, and honestly I don't eat there often. Not because the food isn't good (it is) or because the service is bad (it isn't), simply because I really hate waiting in lines and this place is ALWAYS packed!  I went with four friends last Sunday and we had a great time. My girlfriend showed up 40 minutes early to secure us a table (praisetheLord) and we were able to sit right down and order drinks. I opted for the Strawberry Martini, which our server warned us ""packed a punch"", but it wasn't bad at all. Quite delicious and honestly sweet enough that the sugar rim was an unnecessary garnish. I did appreciate the giant strawberry on the rim though!  I had the Crispy Crab Bites as an appetizer (from their ""skinny"" menu) and the Turkey burger as my meal. I had requested sweet potato fries and it came out with normal fries, which our server Christopher quickly remedied. Looking at my check I don't see the upcharge for the sweet potato fries, so that was an unexpected bonus.  A lot of times turkey burgers are too obviously pre-formed patties, or they are overly dry. This one was fantastic, but it was almost too moist! It fell apart all over the place and I had to eat it with my fork as a kind of turkey-burger-scramble, but it was delicious nonetheless.  For an appetizer, entree, and two drinks, my tab was still under $50. Not bad for a night out at Southpoint. The only downside was, after all of our food, we didn't have room for any of their signature cheesecake!

I've never really loved eating here, and last night was the last nail in the coffin. I shan't return for dinner. Many of the cocktails are well done, but the menu doesn't make ANY sense. If you're going to have such a weird array of food genres, at least organize them a little better. It took me forever to decide on something that sounded remotely appetizing (Orange Chicken) only to find that ""brown rice"" actually means ""burnt and scraped from the bottom of the pot"". The chicken was sickeningly sweet and I really didn't eat any of this meal. Unfortunate really - especially for the price.

108,Lauren H.,"Raleigh, NC",65,273,32.0,3.0,2012-05-23,"When I think of The Cheesecake Factory, I think of reliably good food with extremely large portions. This is not a place we go regularly, but whenever I do end up here, I never leave disappointed with my meal, and I don't even like cheesecake. We ate dinner here tonight after Josh received a gift card for Christmas. I ordered something new for me, the spicy chicken tacos. The plate came with four tacos that were stuffed full with spicy chicken, cilantro, tomatoes, cabbage, cheese, avocado and crema. They were served with rice and black beans which were also good. Josh got a chicken dish which resembled chicken piccata served with mashed potatoes and asparagus. His was even better than mine. My usual choice here is the Cajun Chicken Littles, which are your basic chicken tenders served with corn and mashed potatoes. However, I wanted to try something new tonight so I steered away from my normal choice. We did not get dessert and left with half of our food for lunch tomorrow. However, I have tried one of the chocolate layer cakes in the past, which was huge and so delicious. As I mentioned earlier, I do not like cheesecake so I can't say much about the cheesecake except that everyone I have eaten here with seems to love the variety of choices. The service here is generally very good. It can get very crowded (usually an hour or more wait, especially on the weekends). We got very lucky tonight and were amazingly seated right away (at 7 PM on a Wednesday night). Overall, this is a good spot to stop for lunch or dinner if you're at the mall. The menu is large enough to have an option to please anyone in your group and they now have a ""Skinny"" menu as well for (slightly) healthier options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-raleigh?start=220,3.76,3.76,3.76,3.1480000000000006,3.76

151,Nancy H.,"Raleigh, NC",25,17,,3.0,2012-06-20,"It's an ok restaurant. The food is average, not memorable, the cheesecake is what I think people really go for. The wait for a table can be long, which is frustrating at times. The menu is way to long, I wish they would shorten their selection and stop trying to be something for everyone. It makes it difficult to order and maybe if they focused on a particular cuisine their quality of food would go up. There serving sizes are enormous, so I would recommend either sharing with someone or preparing to take half or more home with you. That being said, their cheesecake is pretty good. Aside from my own home-baked it is the only kind I have found that I like (although not quite as good as mine). Last time we went, we actually ate somewhere else and just stopped by to get cheesecake to go (I think that is the way I like to do this restaurant the most, avoids the long waits for tables, horribly designed menu etc.). The service is so-so.

131,Justin P.,"Cary, NC",25,81,,4.0,2012-12-22,"I had always heard that The Cheesecake Factory was super popular, but I didn't realize how popular it was until when I actually went. It was 6:00 at the Cheesecake Factory on Glenwood Avenue. There are two entrances to the restaurant and people were just waiting in both entrances. My most helpful tip for newcomers: GET HERE FAST AND PUT YOUR NAME IN FAST!!!!  When we eventually got a table, I took a look at the menu. The lines aren't the only big things at The Cheesecake Factory. The menu is huge! There are probably 10 pages (not including ads) of food, drinks, and cheesecake! The menu is also a little weird. I wouldn't expect Shepard's Pie, Orange Chicken, and Bang Bang Chicken to be on the same menu, but at the Cheesecake Factory, that is the case. I ordered the chicken di pana. It is lightly breaded chicken breast served over a white wine butter sauce with mashed potatoes and broccoli. Here is what I received: 2 GIANT chicken breasts, 4 broccoli florets, and possibly 5 giant scoops of mashed potatoes. Portion sizes are huge. I'm glad I don't come here too often. Everything at the Cheesecake Factory tastes good. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the mashed potatoes were scrumptious. Surprisingly, the Shepard's Pie is delicious. I would definitely recommend the pork chop too.  You can't come to the Cheesecake Factory without their cheesecake. Their cheesecakes are amazing, all of them.

We ordered the appetizer, the Chicken Samosas, wafers wrapped with spicy chicken, served with a cilantro dipping sauce. It was pretty good. My wife had the meatloaf which she thought was pretty good. I had the Salisbury Chopped Steak with mashed potatoes. The food was good, but it did not wow me. In all honesty I think you can get the same quality food at a chain like Chili's or Applebees for 1/'2 the price. The money we spent at Cheesecake was not a dining experience.

Were told it would be twenty minutes. Didn't even leave home for twenty minutes, figuring we'd have to wait like usual. Boy was that right. We waited in the designated parking spots 15 minutes...no employees came out to acknowledge any customers/cars during that time.  (All spots were filled). Called their takeout number to  make certain they knew cars were waiting. It was almost another 15 minutes, and another car's order came out before ours, and they were the last vehicle to arrive. I didn't blame it on the poor girl who finally ran out with our orders, I blame it on poor management and poor staffing during busy times. Do not offer carry out if you cannot accommodate those customers in a timely manner. By the time we got home, we had soggy sandwiches. Watched one couple go in to grab their food themselves.

It was part both and the other side chairs. It was so small, and uncomfortable. We had chicken sliders they were good and I thought it was a large appetizer (we got 4 of them). We also ordered a beer. The menu says what beers they have but no prices. I asked if they had any beer specials and my waiter said no we never have specials (rudely) and asked for my id. I would of never ordered the beers if I knew I would be paying 7.25 per glass! And the waiter asked if we wanted another one and never mentioned the cost. We ordered 4 beers and it end up costing as much as our appetizer and two entrees. For the entrees we got Alfredo which was very plain I did not eat most of it. The other entree was stuffed chicken tortillas. Most of the plate was filled with black beans, the pancakes that came with them were too sweet, too cornmeal tasting, and the tortillas were just okay. The floor was slippery so I mentioned it to a waitress passing by and she said it was from the grease they carry out from the kitchen and they have non slip shows so it doesn't bother them. I almost slipped and than I watched a woman shortly after almost do the same thing. They said they would clean the floor, they never did. I would go back for the cheesecake and that's it.

Portion sizes are large.  That being said the prices reflect it and normally I have to take food home and I would rather get and pay for smaller portions and eat it at one sitting. Bad: Menu is too large.  So many pages and options.  Three pages of appetizers alone.  Also all of the advertisements in the menu seems cheap.  The food is not cheap so do you have to subject your guests to pages of advertisements that surely you sold that space for? The veggie burger is downright gross.  I will admit it is hard to find a place with a good one but this was on the list of the worse ones I have ever had. I can't ding them on always being crowded - good for them!  But the tables, esp. in the bar area are so close that you have no privacy.  It is like you are almost sitting next to  a stranger. Loud.  Very loud.  Nothing intimate about the setting as you almost have to yell at each other to talk.  Nothing warm and inviting about the atmosphere.  Not relaxing. Fries are salty. Desserts are WAY overpriced.  I have had some very dry ones, too.  Lastly the Limonchello cake.  The cheesecakes are normally good but charging about $8 for a slice of anything is too much!

We love cheesecake factory in Charlotte, NC, Virginia, and in DC where we have family as well. We went there to celebrate a birthday for my uncle who is one of the pillars of our family. First, the people here told my cousin that they don't take reservations when she called a week ahead of time and the day of in the morning when they opened, which is a lie, because again, we go there all the time and all of the cheesecake factories take reservations. So when the rest of the family got there which was 10 minutes later, we still had to wait 30 minutes. My family party was about 12-15 people, they tried to sit us down in two separate areas. I don't know what they were thinking. 6 people would sit on the far left side of the restaurant and the rest on the right side. We are celebrating a birthday at a restaurant for God's sake. Then the young lady in front that was seating individuals, with red long hair, had a very nasty attitude and was down right rude. Well my mother talked to her like she had some sense somewhere and informed her that we are here to patronize the restaurant. She didn't pay attention to us at all because we were of color, however, the individuals of white American decent were seated and handled in the utmost manner. NOT ACCEPTABLE. We actually know some of the board of trustees and partners as well as investors in the restaurant. Not to throw names around, but again, we go there almost once or twice a week, so this was horrible. Needless to say, the manager, a guy who seemed as though he had no clue of being a manager tried to seat us in two booths. Not only were we annoyed, we were furious. We just sat down to get the dinner over with vowing to never come back. We sat down in two booths that were back to back and the food was simply nasty and uneatable. Example, my sister and I had a steak, salmon, and shrimp dinner and I had salmon and the salmon was small like 2 inches long and 3 inches wide. The steak was hard, nasty, and not seasoned. We look over to the left of us and there was a reservation for a party of 20 full of teenagers and kids; but I thought you don't do reservations. The only positive to this place was the server. She was so friendly and we gave her a great tip!

We got seated quickly, then the waitress took 10 minutes to come over. She was quick to bring drinks back, but took forever to take our order even though she came out twice bringing food to a table and the check to the table across from us.  When our order finally was taken it took over and hour to get it out to us and they forgot my plate! It took the manager 10 minutes to get over to the table to apology for the delay. Of course they did comp our meals. And 10 more minutes for me to get food. Told my mom and sister in the meantime to eat since their food was getting cold. Her tuna was over cooked and the crust wasn't crusty but soggy.   The only up side is that the cheesecake that I got to go was awesome, of cousrse let's hope that a restaurant named the Cheesecake Factory would get that right!!! My main issue is the excuse that it was all to blame on the kitchen. I saw some waitress' that could be a better job. And a manger that shouldn't have taken that long to come out and apologize  at my table.  I have worked in the restaurant business  and always hate that the kitchen gets blamed  for everything maybe if the menu wasn't soooo large the staff could have an easier time getting food out!  Also management has to be in command of the staff and it looked to me like they were clueless.  We were clued in that I wasn't the only one who wasn't get food.

Why they cannot simply plate on regular plates is beyond me. Every time we are there with our kids, we have to send their orders back to be re-plated.

We ordered ribeye steak with mashed potatoes & onion rings. As well as a chicken & penne pasta dish. Honestly I didn't think the food was worth the price but the cheesecake is enough to make me come back again & again.

The food is always piping hot and very tasty. I've had the egg scramble, the omelette mentioned, the grilled salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus is my go-to. They also have some really good grilled spinach that you can sub for if you're not down with asparagus. I appreciate that tangy lemon butter sauce they pour over the plate with the grilled salmon meal. (And no, they don't cook the salmon to death here -- thank goodness! Though still, I always do try to remember to ask for it medium rare to medium as a safeguard.) The numerous flavors of cheesecake are exactly what I'm into, and I've tried almost every kind, including several of the seasonals.

I go and I'm waiting behind 4 waiters who are ordering cheesecake for their tables. The staff working the bakery seemed unbothered and the waiters were in no particular rush. After waiting 10 minutes and listening to their after work plans someone noticed me and took my order. 5 minutes later I was handed my slice of cheese cake that was sitting in the display window. I paid my $8 and went on my way. I got the red velvet cheesecake. One word ; Yuck  It was so bland with the WORST aftertaste. No creaminess no cheesecake flavor. Just gross chemical flavor. My whipped cream tasted better. Immediately my cheesecake went in the trash and I went to Walmart who's cheese cake was 100 times better.

Not a bad experience, and one I'd do again, but not one I'm in a hurry to get back to considering the myriad of other great restaurants Raleigh has to offer. My friend had a craving for Cheesecake Factory, so I figured what the hey, since I'd been years ago in Charlotte and thought it was ok. The wait on a Sunday evening was about 20 minutes around 6 PM. Service was fast and friendly, so no points off there. The seared tuna tataki salad was pretty good. Fresh ginger, ripe avocado, and tuna were delicious, not to mention a high point in a menu not friendly to the calorie-conscious. (I did not save room for dessert, sadly). If I had to name a downside, is that this dish, with an unsweetened tea, cost over $21 bucks (not including tip) and had to wait 20 minutes for. Though what I ordered was perfectly fine, I definitely knew I was paying more for decor/the franchise/etc, which is typical for more upscale chains like Maggiano's, California Pizza Kitchen, and Cheesecake Factory. rather than a novel culinary experience. Again, so many other great restaurants around Raleigh that offer more bang for the buck.

68,K S.,"Raleigh, NC",0,8,,1.0,2015-08-18,"I have family that work at Crabtree so we have gone to Cheesecake Factory a number of times. This occasion was my sister's mother-in-law's birthday celebration. A very sweet 76 year old woman who was accompanied by 'Sister' another very sweet elderly lady. We arrived at 2:25pm on a Sunday afternoon, expecting a wait of course. We were told a 25 minute wait for a table. All right thats acceptable. After 50 minutes of waiting in an overheated hallway I went up to ask how much longer it will be. Was told rather rudely that it will be an additional 15 minutes since we had the audacity to have 7 people in our party. Now, I've worked in restaurants before, happen to have owned one in the past. And letting my eyes wander around the restaurant I saw at least two tables that could accommodate a slightly larger than regular party of 7..both tables were empty and reset. No one was being shown to them and they remained empty the 5 minutes or so it took for me to get the attention of the hostess. Finally after 15 more minutes we were called to the hostess stand where were subjected to standing around (with 2 older women over 75) with I would guess part of another large party for at least 5 more minutes while we waited for someone (not a hostess) to show us to a 'table' which ended up being a cramped booth really meant for 4 people (perhaps 6 in a crunch) with a chair thrown at the end of it blocking a narrow passageway.  There were two other same sized booths completely empty by the way..right next to the one we had just been sat at. My husband had the misfortune of getting the chair at the end of the booth and was constantly being bumped into by passing wait staff. Let me round it up and say that the wait for a table exceeded an hour. Our order was taken promptly enough, my unsweet tea was refilled with sweet tea (absolutely hate that)  and we proceeded to wait an additional 50 minutes for 5 salads , a hamburger,and a dried out chicken dish. Our waiter was replaced mid way through our service because obviously we went from being lunch customers to dinner, since it now was after 4:00pm. My husband had to take his salad to go because the wait was so long and he had to return to work. We all ordered cheesecake and they sang a happy birthday..except my cheesecake did not come out with the others. By the time it did everyone else in the party was finished and ready for the checks and to get the heck out of there. I asked for it to go. From start to finish, the whole unpleasant experience lasted almost 3 uncomfortable hours.  Unfortunately, I will not be coming back. Its been a tradition to take the older members of our family there to celebrate their birthdays. But I was in a state of discomfort after waiting over an hour for a table, being crammed in an uncomfortable booth for almost an additional 2 hours..I can only just imagine how very uncomfortable those two ladies were at the end of the meal. They were too polite to complain. I fortunately do not suffer the same malady. Hey Cheesecake...you need to hire a competent and time conscious hostess, you need to be better organized, and have a quicker turn around. You need to train your staff better on a whole.

I work at a restaurant as a waitress and I will say the costumer service I always receive at this restaurant is near to none. The service is always very bland and nothing great for what you'd expect at such an expensive, high quality restaurant.  I get better costumer service at a McDonald's honestly and that's pathetic. Last night I went to the Cheesecake factory for my birthday. As we sat on the patio it started to look like it was going to rain and began to sprinkle a little. A waiter we getting his table an umbrella. He asked us if we would like one, and we said yes.... he looked at us and said.. with an attitude  ""they are over their, you can go get one"".... for one I do not go to a restaurant and spend well over $100 to get my own umbrella. Not to mention he was very rude about it. We eventually got our table moved inside bc of the rain. We spoke to a manager about the issue and the Manger didn't seem to be too nterested nor care attitude all. Not sure if this was an hourly manager or what but by his very unprofessional attitude I would assume so. I think all of the employees seem to be very unprofessional. When the group of guys came to sing happy birthday to me at my table,  they made me feel miserable.  You could see the ""I hate my life"" all over there faces and they were walking off before they barely got the last word out. I just as much as any waitress understand that some days we just don't want to, but the phrase ""fake it till you make it"" applies in this job.  For them to go to work and make the money they do waiting tables, you'd think they'd work a little harder and be alot happier.  I deal with crazy, ridiculous people at my job and I always have a smile on my face and work hard for my money.

I had been dying to go back bc I love me some Cheesecake Factory. My whole family party was about 10 and our wait was about 45 min on a Sunday evening which was fine. We were seated and we told our server that it was my sisters birthday so that they could do something for her. So we ordered and the food came in just in time since the bread was going fast and we had gotten to our second baskets of bread. What is it about their bread and butter?! Haha so good. Since the portions are so big a few of us shared dishes so that was perfect because we finished it. Soon after our plates were picked up we asked the waiter to already do the birthday thing so we could sing my sister happy birthday and give her her cards and present. However she did not do anything yet. We waited and she was nowhere to be found. We ended up just giving my sister her cards and gifts bc it was already a while. And we finally placed our dessert order bc she told us they can't do a birthday special thing for her unless we ordered dessert. I was shocked. It ruined the rest of our what happened to be a perfect dinner celebration. They finally sang happy birthday when the cheesecake came out but the night was basically ruined. On top of that after singing the song (which normally the bday celebrant blows the candle and makes a wish) she interrupted the moment to ask if we need anything else. It was just all kinds of wrong after that. So all in all the food and overall service was great but that last part was not. I can't remember a place that doesn't do something special for birthday occasions without needing a dessert order. I just didn't feel it make sense.

The top half of the slice is pumpkin cheesecake and bottom half is a pecan pie. It's a great combination of two wonderful desserts. The cheesecake was good, and they're definitely on point with the pumpkin flavor. It had just the right amount of spice, and the texture of the cheesecake is always pretty good at the Cheescake Factory. The crunch and sweetness of the pecan pie part really complements the pumpkin cheesecake, and I enjoyed my cheesecake. My only complaint would be that the price of $8 for a cheesecake slice is pretty high, but you are getting quality.

We walked into the Cheesecake Factory at 8:17 p.m. on Sunday February 21st. We were immediately greeted by a very kind gentleman in a blue shirt (who we thought was the manager) and the hostess. We put our name in for three people and were told that we had a fifteen minute wait. That was completely fine. When we were finally seated (which was not in the fifteen minute wait mark) we were greeted by our waitress. After all our food was ordered and brought to the table (which took 45 minutes!) my fiance had noticed that something he had specifically ordered not to have was on his food. Because of his allergy the food was sent back. In the meantime of waiting for his meal, my friend and I have completely finished ours. By the time we were ready for our checks our waitress mentioned the manager (who we HAVE NOT seen all night long) was offering us free cheesecake. We decided we didn't want to take advantage and asked to just speak to the manager to explain our situation. When the manager came over and introduced himself is when the REAL problem occurred!! The manager's name was PHIL. The second he came to our table there was instantly a rude vibe coming off from him. He asked us what our problem was and as we started to describe it he interrupted us with a sarcastic remark about the ""timing"" and continued with saying our problems were in fact not really problems. Phil then apparently decided he was done hearing us and stood up and said ""WHATEVER THE FOODS ON ME."" We were in COMPLETE shock. I have NEVER in my life been so disrespected EVER.

There were groups of people in the entrance and waiting area, so I knew we would have some wait time. When I asked about the wait time for two, the Hostess said it would be about 15 minutes. Not bad with all these people standing around waiting, so I had them put my name down and they gave me a number. I should've known that it would be much longer than 15 minutes!

It didn't take our waitress long to come over and take our drink order. To keep things simple, we just asked for water with lemon.  While we went over the menu our waitress brought our water along with the complimentary bread and butter. I was starving, so I pretty much ate all the bread..lol. I decided on the Spicy chicken sandwich with the side of fries and my guest got the Factory burger and fries. We waited probably 15 minutes before our food came out.

Long story:  Their system is inefficient and chaotic.  They are preparing to-go dessert and dine-in dessert orders all in the same small space.  Once you get through the line and finally order (and pay), you don't really realize you're in for such a long wait.  The cashier asks for your name, which they'll call out once your order is ready.  However, the lobby is super crowded, and there were dozens of other people waiting for their to-go cheesecakes.  As such, its hard to get close enough to hear your name.  Regardless, waiting for anything more than 5 minutes is unacceptable.  The cheesecake is good, but its not the best dessert in Raleigh. I'd never wait that long again.  If we hadn't already paid ($17 plus tip for 2 slices), we would have left.  But of course, once you pay, you're stuck waiting.  It's not like you could even make it back to the register to ask for a refund without waiting in line for 10 minutes all over again.   Another note: people in the lobby commented that they'd been waiting for 60-90 minutes.  That means these people had been waiting since 4:30 or 5, which I would have thought was a ""safe"" time to expect little-to-no wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-raleigh?start=120,3.36,3.22,3.22,2.7280000000000006,3.2760000000000007

Portions are huge (and should be for the price) but no matter when you go, you will have to wait between 15 minutes and hours for a table. If this restaurant were closer, parking was more available, and it was less crowded, I'd go much more often. There have been many times we went here only to find no parking and/or an extremely long wait time, so usually we just don't go anymore except when I have that extra-special craving for my favorite dish and am willing to wait to be seated. Since it's always so crowded, servers tend to be overworked and you  won't be able to easily flag down your server for soda refills or whatever. Why don't they open another one in Wake Forest ?

Three of our four entrees were lunch sized portions. Pasta is cheap, they could do much better. The biggest issue I had was a twenty minute wait for one piece of cheesecake to go. So I'm thinking wow, presentation must be awesome. Nope just a piece of cheesecake on a plate. Its the equivalent of going to DQ and having to wait for ice cream.

Our server came and offered to refill while we were finishing and signing the check. Not good. The table next to us was sat after us and left before us, and we saw their waiter more often than ours. While the specialty cheesecakes were really good (Oreo and Adam's PB), the plain cheesecake was just okay. I was pretty surprised. Texture and presentation were fine, but the flavor was just bland.

They have small plates if you want to try a few different things or you aren't really hungry.

This is a great place to have dinner and also a great place to come just for dessert. Or take it all to go and enjoy it in the comfort if your own house.

203,Marie T.,"Raleigh, NC",28,172,48.0,4.0,2017-01-15,"The one thing you can count on with The Cheesecake Factory is consistency across the board, which helps when you're going to dine with really picky eaters. I feel there are enough amazing restaurants in the Triangle area to avoid chains, but if you're going to go to a chain, The Cheesecake Factory is a good bet. Their menu selection literally has something for everyone (for which I am eternally grateful for when dining with really picky people). Their coffee is solid, too. As far as desserts go (because let's be honest, dessert is the best course), their carrot cake is off the chain. I would seriously drive out of my way for their carrot cake. It is amazing!!!  Best carrot cake I've ever had, and I'm quite the travelled carrot cake eater. Their cheesecakes are all relatively solid (the red velvet is to die for!). Their strawberry shortcake dessert is unfortunately majorly lacking. Avoid this menu item...it's like chewing balloons with sugary sauce mixed in. On to the food! With the varied selection, obviously some things will be better than others because you can't do everything great, but all the entrees I've tried have been pretty solid. The shepherds pie can sometimes fall on the salty side when the kitchen is rushed, the corn fritters are the bomb, the pastas are always pretty good, and the little flatbread pizzas are wonderful. Service is a definite hit or miss. Some servers are excellent at this location and other servers appear to hate their job, the restaurant, and every patron that comes across their table. That's to be expected when a restaurant is this large and the price point is where it is. Unfortunately, due to the proximity to the mall, you can get some larger groups of kids hanging around just ordering drinks and one slice of cheesecake, which I'm sure does nothing to improve the server's mood. Best deal: get your Cheesecake to go and enjoy it in the peace of your own home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-raleigh?start=100,3.32,3.27,3.27,2.8320000000000003,3.29

Chic-Fil-A's white bean chicken chili (limited time only) for $5 was much better. The service was really good, especially for after 9:00. We sat in the bar area and our waiter was very attentive.

34,Aly M.,"Morrisville, NC",0,10,,1.0,2017-04-08,"tl;dr The food was good, as per most Cheesecake Factories but DAMN, management/servers were extremely unprofessional dealing with scheduling. I went with a few friends on a Friday evening. It was super packed and the wait was 30-40 mins which was fine and anticipated since they don't accept reservations. Food was the standard quality that you can expect from the Cheesecake Factory.  Honestly, the service was pretty good throughout the meal, they even brought bananas and stuff out for my 2-year old (odd and unexpected but pleasant, I suppose). The service wasn't super quick but our group didn't mind because we were all chatting.  The bad part came after we had paid for our food and were on the tail end of the desserts that we had ordered. As it turned out, they were getting ready for a large party coming in. That's fine and all and we would have been happy to get up and leave IF THEY HAD TOLD US. But instead, all the servers just stood and stared. And the icing on the cake was when our server stormed past us and huffed, ""WE HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL *THEY* LEAVE!"" That, plus our server's pretty obvious fake-nice act throughout our meal plus that staged and obvious attempt at guilting us out of our seats, pushed me over the edge. So I went and spoke to the manager, just to let them know that they should have handled the situation a little bit better. Now I knew that it's not going to change anything but dang people, get your acts together.  Oh, LOL, and I guess the hostesses and servers were so unprofessional that they let one of the ladies in the big group come up to us and ask if we could leave.  Cheesecake Factory, word to the wise, you should have just explained to us the situation and we would have understood and wrapped up and left.

We were seated pretty fast at a totally claustrophobic two top sandwiches between two more tables.  When I say a tight fit, it was so bad that we didn't talk much during our lunch because the lady to our left talked loudly on her cell the entire time and on our other side the four top chit chatted loudly so we just sort of sat.  Our waiter was friendly and smiled, but he was overwhelmed, I think.  Our water went empty twice and we had to ask a different wait person to fill our drinks.  The crab and artichoke dip was good but the bread that came with it was so hard it was difficult to chew gracefully, or really at all. I ended up eating the dip with my fork!  Our waiter kept asking me if we wanted bread, we said yes twice and it arrived when our first appetizer did.  Kind of a fail.   The Firecracker Shrimp was good, sauce spicy.  The side salad had barely any dressing and just was not good.   My lunch partner ordered tomato basil pasta, it was ok.  Nothing to rave about.   Overall, food is overpriced, service is pretty slow, and dang this place is expensive!

I came in on Sunday around 12:50 and was told by the hostess who barely looked at me that the wait was an hour for 5. I didn't mind since it was national cheesecake day and I expected it. What I didn't like was the fact that she was a hostess but was not friendly at all. I'm sure she was just overwhelmed.  So we ended up walking around the mall for 35 minutes before heading back and as soon as we got back, our buzzer went off, awesome! The Asian girl that sat us was not very pleasant. She was rude in how she spoke to us. I had a stroller, my son is 5 months old. I had asked for a sling so I would be parking my stroller but it was how she spoke to me that got me. It wasn't friendly at all. I told her I would take just the car seat as long as they had the sling I requested. She said to park it near the bar and proceeded to rush me in while my friend parked my stroller. I told her I wanted to wait for my friend so we could walk in together. She seemed a little irritated. When we got to the table, no sling but it was a booth so I opted out since the car seat would fit into the booth with me and my 4 year old. Anyhow, I ended up asking my server for a sling to make it more comfortable. By the way, my server was awesome. Super nice and attentive. As we began to eat, the same Asian girl walked by to seat another family and this time, there was a man in a wheelchair so she needed more space and instead of asking us to move the sling, she TOLD us to move it out of the way for the man. She was rather rude and seemed irritated that we had a sling there. Luckily, I was nursing my son so he wasn't in the sling and we moved it somewhat under the table.  This girl is not meant to work in service. She's not very nice for a job that requires her to interact with people. I understand it was very crowded but you should still be courteous to all your patrons cause it's your job! She was just pushy and it left a bad taste in my mouth.  Like I said, I love Cheesecake Factory and have always had a great experience but this last one was not good. The hostesses are the first impression of a restaurant. Someone really needs to talk to this girl. She looks young and inexperienced. Maybe some more lessons in customer service would benefit her.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-raleigh?start=40,3.16,3.19,3.288,2.476,3.178

I suppose a manager came out also and apologized for the mishap and said they were preparing me another meal. Great. I enjoyed a portion of it and the remainder was boxed so I could take it home along with my key lime cheesecake. My disappointment was in the fact that I wasn't offered anything other than an apology for potentially swallowing glass along with my pasta!

As of 9/17/17, on our occasional trip to the Cheesecake Factory, we ordered the tex mex egg rolls as our appetizer as well as hibachi steak and bang bang chicken and shrimp as our entrees. After about 35 or so minutes, our entrees emerged and me and my wife both were confused. We asked the waiter, who was incredibly understanding and helpful, what happened to our appetizer and he said they didn't ever make them and he would just remove them from our bill.  As I go to eat my hibachi steak, I notice there are chunks of solid potatoes mixed in with the mashed potatoes. Also, the steak, which I ordered medium, came out rare or fresh off the cow.  My wife went to go eat her meal and realized her rice was cold, not even luke warm, and the rice was all clumped together and just disintegrating upon touch.  We asked for a manager to help resolve the situation and make her aware of what went on. When the manager comes over the lady tells me that the potatoes, despite saying mashed on the menu description, are supposed to be ""LUMPY AND BUMPY"" and that the steak I got cooks more rare so I should have asked for it medium well if I wanted it medium. The lady doesn't even address the fact that my wife's meal was cold and our appetizer never came out.  In my time of dining out, I've never had somebody sit there and tell me that I'm wrong and defend the kitchen when the meal that came out was clearly not done correctly. She could have made the situation be done and over with by just saying okay and offering to re cook the dinner but instead wanted to bicker with my wife and I about our meals instead.  The customer service from management was absolutely terrible. The customer service from our waiter, Tyler, was beyond exceptional. He continued to take care of us despite the situation and maintained a positive and helpful attitude throughout. On the bright side, once the food was re cooked, the appetizer came out steaming hot and fresh in 5 minutes and our entrees were both fresh and better than the first time. Although my ""mashed"" potatoes were still ""lumpy and bumpy"". TLDR; didn't get an appetizer, food came out raw with lumpy and bumpy mashed potatoes and wife's food came out cold and nasty rice. Customer service from the manager was terrible but the waiter, Tyler, was exceptional and the second batch of food came out nice and fresh and cooked perfectly, besides the potatoes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-raleigh,3.08,3.11,3.296,,3.098

Seating at the restaurant is hit or miss. If seated in a round booth, you will have a much nicer experience than sitting in the bar area. The tables are just way too close to enjoy the experience.  The menu has always been pages and pages of options. So it's pretty much dependent on what you order.  This visit, I opted for a California guacamole salad. It was huge and no humanoid could eat this size portion in a single sitting. So, while the prices seem higher than normal, know that you will have leftovers!  The salad was way to heavy on the cilantro, I do like cilantro, but next time would opt out as that overpowered the other flavors of the dish.

The waitress never came to check on us after we ordered. We waited 45 minute to get our food. The food was good, not warm-cold. So disappointed!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-raleigh?start=20,2.68,2.98,3.208,,2.8600000000000003
255,Debra M.,"Morrisville, NC",100,32,23.0,3.0,2018-01-08,"The server was fine. The food was fine. The cleanliness of the establishment was pretty awful. I admit that it was late on a Saturday 9:30pm when we arrived but it was dirty. The floor had multiple things on it and the women's rooms were a disaster area. I was pretty disappointed by that because, honestly, I believe that cheesecake factories are usually run efficiently and cleanly. There have been tons of articles about their methods and how healthcare should replicate it. I would not want my hospital to look that dirty though...I hardly even wanted to stand on the bathroom floor. I've been in nicer Wal-Mart bathrooms.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-raleigh,2.72,2.99,3.2,,2.8820000000000006
261,Jim E.,"Cary, NC",0,1,,1.0,2018-01-10,"I brought my family out to dinner to celebrate my daughter being home from college in Massachusetts for the holidays. We arrive for dinner at around 7 PM, our food is bought out at 7:55, which is fine with drinks, bread and conversation. The only problem was that my meal, the chicken Parmesan ""pizza style"", did not come out. I am told it'll be right out, then I am told it was ""sold to someone else"" and they are re-making it and it would be out in 5 minutes. At 8:06 they offer to bring me some soup, so I say okay, might as well eat something while everyone else is eating. At 8:17, a full 22 minutes after everyone else's meal is delivered, my dinner shows up. 2 in my party have finished eating, and 1 ate so slow waiting for my food to come out that their food is cold (the other meal was a salad, so I guess it was already not hot.) By that time, I have been hitting the water and ate half the bowl of soup so I could only eat a little bit of the chicken.  We get all our leftovers boxed up and when the bill comes, I tell the waitress that I do not want to pay for the chicken parm that held up the family dinner. The manager comes over and asks if we were offered soup, which I was, and I told him I ate about half of it, but I ordered chicken parm and it was over 20 minutes later than the rest of the food at the table. I also told him that I did not want to punish the waitress for whatever error was made in the kitchen or with the orders. He told me I had to do what I had to do. I was like, are you serious, you are not going to take the $14.50 off the bill of over $90? He indicated that if I would leave the chicken parm leftovers at the table, he would not charge me for it.  I was shocked - I'd never heard that from a manager before in all my years of frequenting restaurants all over the country. I said to him, what difference does that make, you are just going to throw it out, and you've already created a NOT enjoyable dining experience for us here tonight. He said that if I was going to take the leftovers with me, that he was not going to give me free food. At that point, dinner ruined, I felt kinda bad leaving a $0 tip on a $93 bill, but I felt like that manager gave me no choice. Sorry Salma! Everyone understands that sometimes orders get screwed up, it's part of the experience you go through when you visit any restaurant. But the way it was handled at the Cheesecake Factory, for the price of the ""Experience"" of eating there, was definitely a bad experience. I drove by literally dozens of restaurants to get there, and I will not ever be going back. There are too many places that show they DO care about customers to give any more of my $ to a place like that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-raleigh,2.68,2.98,3.184,,2.8600000000000003
