But this review is simply about The service here at this location is just plain and simply stupid! Something needs to be done by management ASAP! The last few times we have been here we get sat pretty fast but then  wait and wait for a while before someone comes and brings us water or acknowledges us!!! We sit there wondering who the f is our waiter??  I also find it very annoying that our waiter/waitress gets switched on us like 2-3 times! I understand people have to take breaks but seriously the last time we were there we literally had no idea who the hell our waiter was bc we had someone come up to our table and introduced themselves 3 times!!!! lol.... To the cheesecake mgt get ur heads out of ur asses and get ur staff on point! Great food but terrible experience which unfortunately for your business I have to give u a poor rating for bad service!! Almost forgot to mention when our first waitress came by and finally took our order after like 10 mins of waiting. I was actually reading reviews about this place on yelp. After taking our order she quickly came back and asked, ""were u waiting for a long time?"" I said yes. I'm sure she saw the yelp page open on my phone lol...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rancho-cucamonga?start=700,3.4,3.4,3.4,2.9520000000000004,3.4000000000000004
566,Tiffany G.,"Buckeye, AZ",8,14,,2.0,2012-01-25,"This review is directly related to the service received at Cheesecake Factory. All of the food we ate was excellent. My mom wanted to go to the Cheesecake Factory for her birthday so we made the trip down there. The wait time was 45 minutes for a Saturday evening around 6pm. Not bad at all. We were seated 60 minutes later, still not too bad for a Saturday evening with football on. Our waiter came, took our drink order, came back with the drinks, and then took our dinner order. My dad ordered the garlic pasta, my mom ordered the chicken tacos off the light menu, my husband ordered the mac n cheese burger, and I ordered the shrimp tacos off the light menu. Twenty or so minutes later, my dad's food came out. Kidding you not, five minutes went by before my mom's food came out. Another three to four minutes later my husband's food came out. I asked the server where my food was and she said the manager would be over to explain, then she bolted.  When the manager came over, instead of addressing the table, she spoke only to me. Of course there was some mix-up in the kitchen on where my food was. But she never explained why the rest of the food came out at different times and while she kept apologizing, it was clear she did not care. Once the food finally made it, it was good. I'm disappointed in the lack of service but will try another Cheesecake Factory down the road. Just not this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rancho-cucamonga?start=520,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.9520000000000004,3.3200000000000003

I normally opt for miso salmon or that pasta farfalle with BACON and peas but this time around I wasn't in the mood for anything fishy or heavy. Renee's special looked good. It comes with half sandwich of your choice, generous bowl of soup of day, and a salad. My choice of sandwich was the almond chicken salad. I personally thing Costco's chicken salad is probably better but this one wasn't too bad tasting. Even though they say it's half of a sandwich, it's really like a whole sandwich. The bread comes slathered in butter and toasted.  I got to try their New England clam chowder, which was pretty tasty. The balsamic dressing is always delicious to me. Altogether, I personally wouldn't get tha chicken salad again, but would get anything with that balsalmic dressing. Service was okay. They crammed 7 of us ladies in a booth.

They found my weakness for fried macaroni and cheese balls.  Their cheesecakes are delicious and it takes me a little too long to decide on which one to order. The Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake is probably my favorite and is definitely a must try.. as of all of their cheesecakes. So glad it's part of Victoria Gardens; you can fill up on cheesecake and burn off the calories as you walk around and shop.  The ONLY problem I have with this particular restaurant is that it's always busy and there's always at least a 30 minute wait (unless you go in the daytime during the middle of the week).

Went there the other day with my fiance. The waiting area was crowded but we only waited for 10 minutes which was decent. When we sat down at our table, The table was still dirty from the last patrons. It had bread crumbs and other filth on it. The WORST of it is that they put the flatware on the table which was dirty. No napkins wrapping and protecting the flatware or even placing the flatware on top of the napkins, no, just the flatware straight on the dirty table. So gross. The waiter was aweful also. We waited at our table for quite some time before he even came over to get our drink orders. He was awefull.

The server already knew she was going to get the automatic 18% gratuity tacked onto our bill so there wasn't anything she really had to work for. I think since this restaurant chain is such a fashion statement, they remain a watering hole for many crowds. The food portions may be large but quality, taste and quantity are highly inconsistent. They do not accept reservations so forget holding a large gathering here, you could get stuck waiting a long while. If you come in a large crowd, do not expect decent service, but do expect to fork over an often undeserved tip. There should be a law against that so customers are not forced into tipping for bad service. I attended another graduation party at a hole in the wall restaurant the next day and was much more impressed. Plus the restaurant refrigerated the cake I brought the guest of honor until it was dessert time. This place sat us outside, did not care about the cake melting, and did not bring out proper serving utensils. I guess we were to be thankful that they even let us cut the cake there I guess.

I went with a friend to eat dinner around 5:30 PM, or so.  After checking in I was informed it'd be about an hour wait, which didn't bother me because I had expected it after seeing the crowd.  We were seated about 20 minutes faster than expected, which was about the best part of the meal.  We ordered the crab/artichoke dip for an appetizer, and my friend got a glass of wine and I had a Mojito.  My friend's entree was the endive salad and I had shrimp with angel hair pasta.  The food tasted fine, and the server was ok.  My friend's salad, however, was basically void of endive.  I have no idea what that stuff is, but according to her, there was none in the salad.  There was a shift change before our meal was over and we ended up with a new server.  When we were finished, I requested a box for leftovers which took a little longer than usual to receive.  And I'm not sure if i'm wrong or not, but I remember the servers at CF boxing up the food for you.  I'm fully capable of boxing my own food mind you, but that's one of those extra mile things.  I also wanted to get a box for the bread, but the server seemed too preoccupied with the party next to us to notice I was trying to get her attention.  After about 10 minutes, I ended up asking another server for the box. The primary issue with my meal happened about 11 hours or so after it ended.  That's right, food poisoning.  I woke up Sunday morning at 6 AM with an immediate urge to go to the bathroom.  What followed was a day filled with trips to the bathroom, spaced an average of 15-20 minutes apart.  And when I wasn't in the bathroom, I was laying in bed, writhing in pain.  Put simply, I felt as if someone was wringing my insides the same way you would wring water out of a wet towel.  It is now 12:30 AM, Monday morning as I right this and I am still suffering.  The bathroom trips have decreased in frequency and number, as have the sudden painful sensations, but they have not gone away entirely.  I have not been able to keep anything down all day, not even water.  My next step after this review is to contact the restaurant manager and inform him of my experience personally.  Hopefully the staff will be able to take some measures to ensure this won't happen again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rancho-cucamonga?start=560,3.4,3.4,3.4,3.3360000000000003,3.4000000000000004

Another 10 minutes pass and she comes back to ask for our order and I replied to her with ""well we wanted an appetizer but.."" and she interrupted me to say I can take my time she'll just come back... Took our appetizer order down and left. We got the mushroom, zucchini, avocado fries which were amazing BTW!!! She came back about 5 minutes after we had eaten all of our appetizer to take our food order (so who knows how long we waited I lost track enjoying the yummy food!)

Because it's local and  the food and service are second to none CF has a menu like a book that offers a wide variety of yummy cuisine regardless of where you're from or what your taste buds are used to.  The food is absolutely luscious and wonderful. It's a tad overpriced perhaps. But boy, they know what they are doing here. They really do. The service is always prompt, waiters are nice , attractive and energetic and the place is lively. They refill your water as expected and you never have to flag a waiter down. Oh, and they don't run out of stuff. If you are sitting outside, they don't forget about you, and you get the same five star service as if you are sitting inside. Don't worry if it's cold, they have kerosene tower heaters.. The desserts and dessert bar are very expensive. I think I saw a whole cake there for $50. By the slice it is around $7.00 or more Noise level can be quite loud depending on what time you go there. The décor is Ritz Carlton nouveau riche to a degree but still inviting and not imposing This restaurant chain should give the others lessons Wait times can be somewhat long, but that is expected when it is a busy time for them.

I then received a spaghetti with meat sauce instead of the carbonara plate I ordered...  The waitress took it back and then came back and stated they tossed peas and bruschetta into the spaghetti plate she had taken away. What??  Lol. I told her to take it back and remake the right dish that I ordered..  Haha. But...  Then the manager came and talked to us and ensured my dish is being freshly prepared and took it off the bill.  Don't forget to always let the waitress know when something's not right with your order/meal or the service, you deserve a good dining experience and a quality meal.  In my case, the waitress already knew that this was wrong and alerted the manager before I could say anything..  That's a good thing, but at the end, the waitress ended up to not be attentive and was MIA for the most part..   Probably because she had too many other tables to wait on.

After about 30 minutes our pager went off and we were seated by our waiter. So we're at our table relaxing and talking ejoying ourselves when some male Cheesecake Factory employee confronted us asking us with a very angry look on his face and in a very demining tone of voice and asked us  if we had checked in.I mean this male employee was behaving like he was coming down off METH and he needed a fix. So we did'nt respond.  We were just  looking at him like what in the hell are you talking about and what is your problem. So he raised his head up with his nosie  flaring open he was turning red and foaming at the mouth loudly repeated to us did you check in. I remained very calm because i have class and morals so i simply pointed towards our waiter and told this animal to talk to him. The problem was our waiter forget to punch in our ticket after or before he seated us so this low class amoral no manners havin unprofessional disrespectful gasbag thought we actually snuck in and seated ourselves what a flippin empty suit . He had to be on some kind of drugs. Our waiter was very professional and he apolagized for this animals behavior. I felt this male employee owed us an apology so when i saw him again i said excuse me i did'nt like the way you talked us you were rude and you are the one who made the mistake not us. He looked at us with a very nasty look on his face and said im doing my job and walked away. I called him a DICK HEAD. Personally i wanted to reinact a sense from one of those reality shows. This fool has ZERO class and no morals he woulld'nt even apologize and he is the one who made the mistake. Finally a manager came over and talked to us she was very nice she apologized and compted us our drinks and a slice of cheesecake.

The host seemed very bothered when answering my husband's question. We did not want to sit outside with our kids because it was a very hot, humid day. Once we were finally seated we told the server we wanted to order everything (drinks, appetizers, and entrees at once because we waited so long and were starving). When I ordered my food I asked for it without sour cream and the waiter made a joke and said extra sour cream and then said he was kidding.. and to top it all off, when I got my order.. there was a big glop of sour cream on it so I had to send it back  and wait longer.

We got the new one and hesitantly ate it. My husband was trying to keep me calm and not to throw up. I waited for a manager or the waitress to come back and talk to us about it and apologize, but nothing. I finally asked the waitress if we can speak with the manager. She said yeah she'll get her. The manager came over and apologized finally and said she would take it off the bill. UH, you should comp our whole bill as I was ready to walk out.

I loved the ambiance and decor paired with an attentive wait staff. The lighting was dimmed down and interior design reminded me of the Bellagio. Our main dishes were excellent and had good flavors that you wouldn't expect from a place like this. The black pepper Jamaican chicken was very tasty and the spices were on point. The main dish portions are definitely a shareable size if you're trying to save some dough though. We also had calamari and buffalo wings which were also delicious but again, pricey.

The service was extremely slow and when we got to our table they sat us in a corner which was extremely dirty. The menu was sitting on top of my napkin and plate which was completely disgusting because MANY people handle the same menu with their bare hands. My utensils were also on the bare table which I'm hoping was cleaned properly. The worse part about this whole trip though was the fact that my sister found a fly in her Green Iced Tea. We told the waitress we wanted another one and she did just that, but when the check came, instead of removing the drink, she charged us for it. I've never been so disappointed in a restaurant. For a chain that is modernly upscale and high priced, I would expect so much more. I will never go back to this specific location again.

They have a very dynamic and large varity of choices on the menu. If I had reviewed this resataraunt a few years ago I would have given it a 4. We went to this particular location recently for my wifes birthday. I had not been to a Cheesecake Factory in quite some time. A couple of my favorite dished are the Chicken Costoletta and the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. The service at this location was just average, It seemed like they were under staffed which made our wait times longer than usual. Their drink prices (which they don't put on the menu) are outrageous. One thing I noticed this time is that the portions seemed to have decreased. One of the things I like about Cheesecake Factory is that I always left with practically a whole other meal to take home as leftovers (which offset the higher prices for the meals.) Not this time though. Although I could not quite finish my meal, there was not quite enough left to justify bothering to take it home. I almost always order the Chicken Costoletta and in the past ended up taking almost half of it home. The other people that were with me noticed a change in the portions in their meals also.  So it appears they have smaller portions for the same prices.

So I put my name down (party of 2 please) and was given an estimated time and the hostess told me 20-25min, not bad considering the amount of people that were already ahead of me. But,, (good news) she was spot on, I think about 22min passed (I know, I'm a stickler for time) and our table was ready..  During the waiting time for our table, I checked out the menu (over bearing.. Options, options, options) and I highly recommend doing this at any restaurant (so when ur server first comes to you, your ready to order).. I ordered the chicken Madeira and the steak Diane with sautéed asparagus and mashed potatoes (hold the butter).. And a nice wine mushroom reduction sauce on my proteins. Medium on my steak please.. Of course I ordered an app.. Avocado egg rolls (to die for).. With a sweet dipping sauce (yumm) and they don't skip out on the avocado inside (massive amounts ).. And during the wait for our dinner,, of course complimentary bread and butter was given (oh no,, double time at the gym, carbs carbs carbs).  As our food came out, my dinner looked amazing.. Nicely presented .. But one little issue,, my steak was medium well (almost to well done) .. So I sent it back (aggravated,, no not me,, I mean it happens) just be patient.. Finally I got my correct temp on my steak.. So juicy and the chicken so moist and the reduction sauce (flavorful).. Also, we ordered a kahlua coffee cheesecake.. AmAzing taste for coffee lovers..

611,Kathy S.,"La Verne, CA",0,11,,2.0,2015-01-22,"Went to celebrate my birthday. This restaurant is usually crowded on weekends so we went on a Wed. nite instead of Saturday nite (my actual birthday) in order to beat the crowds.  Big mistake!  It wasn't crowded when we got there about 6:30 p.m. but got very crowded as we were waiting for a table.  My husband told them we were celebrating my birthday.  We were not given a pager, but I noticed other folks checking in after us got pagers.  A female employee was calling out names to seat people, but you could hardly hear her because of the loud music and general noise in the restaurant.  We were told there would be a 15 minute wait and they actually called us at 15 minutes, but they took us to a tiny two-fer table near the kitchen next to a large party on one side, and a wall on the other.  The kitchen was directly behind us.  My husband requested another table and the hostess said we would have to wait, so we decided to wait.  We asked for a booth, but they said the booths were only for parties of 4 or more.  (Don't expect to be seated at a booth if there is only two of you--their seating policy is not customer-friendly and leaves much to be desired.)  Thirty-five minutes after we had arrived, we were seated at another tiny table-for-two between a large party and another couple.  Too close to these tables in my opinion.  Barely enough room on the table to hold the bread, appetizers, and entrees, and drinks that we ordered  And after being seated for a few minutes I noticed my shoes were sticking to the floor under the table.  Ewwwww! Food was fantastic!  We ordered Stuffed Mushrooms and Chicken Samosas as appetizers, I ordered the Tuscan Chicken as my entrée,  my husband ordered the French Dip sandwich, and we ordered one piece of cheesecake to go.  They didn't do the ""birthday thing"" for me, though they were doing it for other customers around us.  My guess is they were so busy they completely forgot about it. No big thing for me, but it might have been for someone else.  We had gift cards given to us for Christmas that we paid with, so they only thing we paid cash for was the tip.  Good thing, because I don't think I would shell out any money to this restaurant Great food or not. Three stars.  Pros:  Good food, good service, fast service Cons:  1. Frenetic, barn-like atmosphere.  ""Ambiance"" music is too loud, as a result people had to talk louder to have a conversation, thus creating an uncomfortable din throughout the entire restaurant.    2. Not enough employees to bus and clean the vacated tables,  making customers wait much longer than necessary.   3. No seating at a booth unless you have a party of 4 or more when the restaurant is busy.  The seating layouts in this restaurant really stink.  The tables are so close together you can't avoid bumping elbows with the stranger at the table next to you, or hearing their conversations.  Not exactly my idea of a nice dinner in a restaurant.   4. Only giving out pagers to certain customers, and not to others.   5. Dirty, sticky floors!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rancho-cucamonga?start=600,3.88,3.4,3.428,2.216,3.592

There are wayyyyy too many choices Which always makes it that much harder to pick something to try. After flipping threw the menu for what felt like 10 minutes I finally found the drink page. Something that stood out to me was the Strawberry Creamsicle. It's like a strawberry shake with alcohol. It was alright. In my opinion not worth $11 I wanted to be different and try something that I normally wouldn't get so I ordered the Macaroni and Cheeseburger. The waitress said that it's super cheesy and good. Well I like cheese so I was extremely excited to get it. But unfortunately super cheesy it wasn't. It just tasted like a cheeseburger. The macaroni was forgettable. I Was disappointed with it.

Shortly after the appetizer arrived and the waiter said we would be served our main course  at another table. When my wine was delivered the waiter placed a napkin over the top of the glass to avoid knats from flying into the glass....seriously?.. the entree was delivered and we were never moved. The manager came to the table finally and told us that we should have said something earlier.....not to manager .....WE DID!!!! And you choose to do nothing. When I complained at the end all he said was sorry. I plan to file a complaint with the health department and I will never eat at Cheesecake Factory again!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rancho-cucamonga?start=580,3.48,3.34,3.452,2.052,3.3960000000000004
580,Nicole A.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",22,4,,2.0,2015-03-15,"The service: We wanted to order some food for take-home, so we utilized the curbside service. After looking through the menu, we selected our entrees and I called in the order. I began telling the greeter on the phone that I would like to place an order to go. Before I finished my sentence, she put me on hold without saying a word to me, which I found to be odd. The only reason I knew I was on hold was because the hold music started playing. After placing my order with the bakery, I was told it would be ready in about 15-20 minutes. We arrived at the curbside parking about 20 minutes after I placed my order, and called the restaurant to let them know we were there. They said they would bring the food right out to us, but 20 minutes later, we were still waiting. We ended up going inside to get the food, which had just been sitting on their counter. Our extremely long wait out at curbside was never even mentioned by them. No apologies, nothing. Being too exhausted from the day, we just paid for the food and left. Needless to say, by the time we got home, our food was cold. The food: I ordered the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta. When I opened the carton, I originally didn't see any chicken.  It wasn't until after I started stirring the pasta a little that I found the 5 bite-sized pieces of chicken that were included in this $18 plate of cold food. The chicken was dry to the point of being hard to chew and swallow. The pasta itself was pretty bland. My husband ordered the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. He said his was ok, but probably would have been better if it was warm. Overall, we may give this place one more try, but I highly doubt we will use Curbside To Go again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rancho-cucamonga?start=560,3.36,3.33,3.444,2.152,3.342

I've dined at this location now twice, once for lunch and once for dinner.  When I came for lunch my party of four was seated pretty quickly. Our waitress was very nice and friendly, BUT oh my god ..... A lady in my party pointed out how DIRTY her shirt was! The waitresses and waiters all wear white blouses and white pants, but her armpits were STAINED YELLOW. We had to see this and then EAT?! It was really disgusting and made us all lose our appetite. The lady who pointed it out to me wanted to tell the manager how gross it was, but didn't want to embarrass the girl. Wow I really don't get why they don't have everyone just wear BLACK. Now that my eyes have been opened to this I always look for it. Ugh.  Lunch: I ordered the Renee special turkey sandwich that came with salad and cream of mushroom soup. The bread of the sandwich was incredibly hard and dry, as was the turkey. The salad had a vinaigrette that I did not like and the cream of mushroom soup was borderline disgusting. It tasted like Marsala sauce.. It was weird. Good thing I had brown bread to eat.  Dinner: bang bang chicken and shrimp. This was my second time ordering this and I didn't like it as much as when I had it at a different location. The sauce was a little too mushy and had too many raisins.  Also, when my coworker and I came for dinner we requested a table outside since it was so cold and dark inside. We were told 15 minutes and given a buzzer. 15 or so minutes later I heard the hostess calling my name... And my buzzer wasn't even buzzing.. So that was pointless. When we got to the patio there were 11 empty tables!! Uhh exactly what were we waiting 15 minutes for?! Our waitress was friendly enough, but that was annoying.

And a place I only go every once in a great while it as it is a special treat. Yesterday when my boyfriend and I went the gravy that usually is served with the chicken and biscuits dinner was switched out for a brown gravy. I am horribly and highly allergic to any beef and or pork of any kind. I was not informed that this gravy had any kind of beef renderings, I have been very sick ever sense.  This was the only meal that I consumed yesterday. And I have been in pain, and I spent a sleepless night with horrible cramps and a lot of other details that I won't bother you with, as they are not pleasant. I will not visit this cheesecake factory again. The portions are huge and my boyfriend and I like to share. The meal was not separately plated. As it is at the cheesecake factory in Riverside at the Tyler Mall. The server at Tyler was kind enough to make our plates beautiful and inform the kitchen that we were sharing. This was not so at Victoria gardens. We were just handed a cold plate and told to five things up amongst ourselves. It wasn't very professional and I didn't feel that a good tip was in order. At the Victoria gardens Cheese Cake Factory we were treated like a number, rushed in and rushed out. Yet at the cheesecake factory at the Tyler Mall in Riverside we are always treated as though it is a special occasion. We are even sat by the window so that we can keep an eye on our vehicle as we have a small dog that we are very concerned about. She is older and needs lots of special attention.  The server at the cheesecake factory at Tyler also gave us a cup of ice water to go for our dog.  The server at Tylor just seemed to have a special knack.

383,Sara K.,"Glendora, CA",17,12,1.0,1.0,2015-05-24,"So disappointed in this place. Came to celebrate my 21st birthday and waited more than 2 hours to be seated. Worst part is, they DO NOT take reservations which is complete bull****. It was my birthday so of course I had a big group (14), knowing beforehand that I was going to be waiting a while, but I didn't think almost 3 hours. The manager, Gabriel, put us down on the list for 2 hours but we ended up waiting basically 3 hours. After waiting, our buzzer didn't even go off so I'm pretty sure if we didn't go up to ask them how much longer, we would've never gotten seated.  Apparently they only have 2 large tables, one inside and one outside. There was already a party of 12 that got there before us. An hour goes by and they seat a party of 16 that came in AFTER us. We go and talk to the manager and the associates tell us that there's nothing they could do. They were rude and had an attitude. The manager, Gabriel, was in no way professional. He made it clear to us that he was the ""manager"" as if he were the president of the United States and did nothing to ease our anger. Being a manager doesn't make you ""special"" lol anyone can be a manager and have better customer service than he did. He told us ""You have to wait, people are celebrating their graduations and birthdays blah blah blah"" like me wearing a big a** light up sash didn't make it obvious we were too! LOL. He even had the nerve to tell us ""15 more minutes"" like he knew that the party that we were waiting for was going to be done by then. Guess what idiot, we waited not 15, but 45 extra minutes including the 2 hours you supposedly put us down for.  This Cheesecake Factory sucks. They need to learn their manners and serve better customer service AND take reservations. Besides the horrible service from the ""manager"" and the two girls up front, our waitress was awesome! She was sweet and very helpful. But I still rate this place 1 star, if I could put no stars, I wouldn't think twice. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rancho-cucamonga?start=380,3.08,3.16,3.32,2.18,3.1280000000000006
305,Sarah L.,"Monrovia, CA",68,10,7.0,3.0,2015-05-24,"Honestly, I would give the hostess 0 stars if possible, but the waitstaff made up for the crappy attitude we recieved from the hostess. Went for a birthday dinner with a party of 14 people on a Saturday night. Unfortunately they wouldn't accept any reservations, even with a large party. They told us it would take about 2 hours to be seated, which seemed reasonable for a busy night. After some time, a few people from our party wanted to check and see how much longer it would take. The hostess gave us an attitude about it so we asked to see a manager. A male gentleman claiming to be the manager came in and gave us the same attitude just because we wanted an update on our wait time.  After 2.5 hours, we finally get seated. Turns out, they turned off our pager as a result of us asking for a wait time update.  Our waitress definately made up for the crappy attitude we recieved from the hostess and manager. She was very attentive to our party and maintained her cheery attitude which eased us from the earlier confrontation. I would give her service an A+ for constantly refilling our drinks, checking up on our meal and her friendliness. The food was also decent enough for the price we paid.  I wouldn't recommend dining here with a large party, but I hope the restaurant will one day be able to accept reservations in the future or even at least upgrade the dining area to allow better accomodations for multiple large parties.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rancho-cucamonga?start=320,2.92,3.16,3.332,2.444,3.0640000000000005
388,Richard O.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",67,30,18.0,1.0,2015-05-25,"This place had me, my friends, and boyfriend waiting for 2 hours and 30 minutes. They kept telling us that it'll be another 30 minutes after another. We had complained to them and asked if there was anything we could get for a complimentary, they refused and as I was talking to the manager who was on duty on 05/23/15 around 6:40 pm he was super rude and replied as ""I'm the manager.."" I didn't appreciate it at all. I didn't care if he was the manager, just the fact that he was a jerk. The receptionist ladies that night as well, we're super rude. One of them that was wearing red lipstick that night, she replied to me as I walked to the table and had asked her if my table was ready, she said ""you come up here too much.."" I didn't like that. Who trained her? Because they sucked. She was super rude and her customer service sucked ass. She needs to either change her attitude and behavior or get re-trained. Also, they kept moving those of groups of 2-6 ahead of us when they came in at a later time than us. Which didn't make sense!  Overall the food was good and the waitress was super nice and friendly. That is why I'm giving it a 1 otherwise I would have given it  a 0 for me. Customer service at the front end sucked! Make them better (:  And by the way, you guys need to make bigger tables because 2 isn't going to work for those who have to wait. And/or have options such as combining the tables together.

261,Jordan A.,"Albuquerque, NM",19,46,,2.0,2015-05-29,"The only reason this is two stars instead of one is because the slice of cheesecake I ordered was the best thing I've ever had.  For starters, we got in there and they said the wait would be about 30-45 minutes. No big deal, we were visiting from a state that doesn't have a Cheesecake Factory and I was willing to wait. After about 30 minutes, our buzzer went off. Yay!  Not yay. We gave them our buzzer and they said to stand in this other area and our name would be called shortly. From what I could tell, they'd print off a sheet of paper with our name and table number on it, then take us to the table. We waited 15 minutes in line, with other parties that had 4-6 people in them being called ahead of us. Then they called the party of 2 that was in front of me and my fiance, so I was hopeful we'd be next. Nope, another five minutes of them calling everyone except us. I finally lost my patience and went to the host desk and said ""Excuse me, but what was the point of buzzing us up here if you're going to make us wait another 20 minutes for a table?"" There was a man that was probably a manager standing up there, and he took me and my fiance to a table immediately after that remark.  Our server was just as bad. Her section included a table of what was either her friends or fellow employees, and she spent her time sitting with them and laughing, with my fiance and I she was quite cold. Not rude, just not friendly and not overly helpful. I'm willing to bet the manager told her about my losing my patience and she assumed that I was going to continue being rude, which stinks for her. I ordered the Lingurian pesto pasta, and the type of pasta had changed and the chicken I added to it had just been haphazardly tossed on top of the bowl of pasta. My fiance had a pizza that was relatively decent.  My Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake was to die for though.

It was the waiting after we had ordered our drinks. The waiter took the next table food order straight away even though they arrived after we did. After 20 min of waiting on a beverage order he finally took our order. 45 min- an hour later our food arrived. By this time we all just wanted to go home. Not once did the waited come back and ask for refills.. It was discouraging.  He was obviously overwhelmed or something.

The chicken Alfredo we ordered was bland and sent back. The pasta carbonara has a very strange after taste. The only kind of decent food we had was the chicken littles. I'll keep coming for cheesecake, but anything else isn't really worth it.  Also, I really hope the menus are cleaned or sanitized between customers since the hosts just throw them down on the napkins we use to wipe our mouths, the plates that hold our food we consume, and all the silverware we put in our mouths.

The Louisiana Pasta was supposed to have a creamy New Orleans sauce but they were either short on sauce or forgot to put on the plate. The bow tie pasta was swimming in oil. Rather nasty.

We've had rude waitresses that give us attitude after we point out an error with our order to those that go above and beyond to deal with my picky dad. It's a long wait and I can't tell you if it's worth it or not, but if you love the food and don't want to wait I'd suggest calling in and ordering your food to go.

The menu is really consisitent and you have the options of having big parties or a date. Most of these restaurants give the same consistent experience but i like the one in rancho is the best place to settle down after shopping. You have all of the stores you need close by and if it really crowded you can takes seats outside. Even in the winter it feels nice and warm due to the heaters they have. If there was anything i could complain about it would be that there isnt such a great waiting area inside. During the winter you dont want to wait outside it gets too cold and its the only place without the heaters. So when you go inside there are only two benches to sit and on the weekend that place gets swarmed. You cant call and make reservations so its tought to avoid the crowd. If you do see that its busy dont underestimate how quick they can seat you. Today when i went i would have guess were going to wait at least 45 minutes but the hostess said 15 minutes which actually ended up being 12. So always ask the wait.

The waiter looked tired and didn't want to make second trip for our order of fries when There were two that had been ordered a side for order and he said it was actually a double order put together I said no it's not its one order and my daughter had a separate order which came separately.  he knew I noticed he was lying to me about that in order to avoid his second trip to the kitchen but he quickly corrected it by grabbing us our order of fries and bringing them out.  I know it's hard to sometimes keep a smile but when a customer walks in they are paying for expensive meals so the appropriate thing to do is to be more courteous and smile more be appreciative that we are there as customers and paying a pretty penny for our dinners. We go there because it's dining and entertainment.  people already have tough days and go there to enjoy a nice dinner and relax with family or what not. Make their visit a pleasant one. At least for the hour they are there then you can vent your frustrations once the visit is over.  I would've left a higher tip had he simply smiled and made us feel more welcomed instead of looking forced. Customer service matters a lot when you arrive at a restaurant you really like and tell a lot of people about. Especially now with social media.  I'd like to mention that the environment is still nice and located at VGs which is always good because you can walk around after or before a meal if the weather is pleasant that day/night. What can I say it's still one of my favorite restaurants and would've given it a 5 had the customer service Been better and the hostess not forgotten about seating us a lot later than what we were suppose to wait. 10 mins turned into 30 and it was 1030pm   And forgotten.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rancho-cucamonga?start=260,3.36,2.81,3.164,3.0520000000000005,3.0300000000000002

The service was outstanding! We both really liked him and wish I had gotten his name to mention here.  As for the food: They give you bread while waiting for your dinner which was yummy.  We shared the artichoke dip and it was SO delicious but they really skimped on the tortilla chips.  I had the Kobe burger (heavenly, really everyone should try it) and the baked potato soup (amazing beyond words.) My friend really enjoyed her chicken fettuccine although I feel it was overpriced ($21) but it was a large portion!  We told our server it was her birthday and that we didn't want singers or attention, just a candle and a birthday message written on the plate.  Note to everyone: Birthday cheesecake ain't free here! Only negative comment I have is the price of the alcohol. They don't have the price of the drinks on the menu for good reason! We each had two rounds of lemon drop martinis and ended up paying over $50 on drinks alone.

202,Ataru N.,"Hesperia, CA",10,372,181.0,4.0,2016-03-12,"I first tried Cheesecake Factory in MD on a date with a guy I met when I was in town for an anime convention in the late 90s. The love affair has continued for 15+ years... (With Cheesecake Factory, not the guy.) I am not a huge fan of chain restaurants in general, but of the chains, Cheesecake is my favorite. Huge portions, consistent quality, open relatively late, quite an array of choices that don't suck, modern, lush decor reminiscent of themed luxury hotels in Vegas (it's no wonder that this chain was chosen for the Grand Lux Cafes in the Venetian and the Palazzo), and good if not incredible service. The fresh and hot bread they give for free is as good as or even better than bread I have paid extra for at high-end restaurants. Not everything I have had here is good, hence the 4 stars instead of 5, but the things I like are pretty consistent. We always share the chicken marsala with mushrooms and bowtie pasta, plus something else new, usually chicken something. The bowtie pasta (angel hair or spaghetti is another story) is almost never overcooked (hard to find in Italian restaurants especially out here). It's always enough for at least 2 or 3 meals. Unfortunately for a place with cheesecake in their name, they don't have any cheesecakes, or any desserts really, that I don't find way too sweet to bother ordering. I can't stomach more than a bite or two. We've given up on desserts here. Service can suffer a bit when they're busy, but I find that having an understanding attitude about their being swamped always gets me better service. The worst service I ever had here was a girl who was just phoning it in, she wasn't even rude or anything. Bathrooms are usually clean and there isn't usually a wait except during high traffic times. I try to avoid this place on Friday and Saturday evenings. I like the ""eye of Sauron"" lamps at all the booths. Some dishes we consistently enjoy:  * Ahi tuna tartare - the sauce this comes with is delectable, and I like the deep-fried wonton chips, though I usually don't at other places (too greasy)  * Ahi tuna carpacchio - this comes with a different sauce which is equally delectable  * Chicken marsala - TBH even though this is my favorite dish, it borders on sweet, just below the level beyond which I would find it inedible Some dishes we tried once and liked:  * Portobello, avocado & zucchini sticks (I prefer the portobello ones; the zucchini sticks are too soggy and the avocado is too ripe and mushy)  * Chicken Madeira  * Pasta da Vinci - basically the same as the Chicken Madeira but with penne instead of mashed potatoes  * Chicken with Lemon Couscous - delicious, but was Israeli couscous, not regular couscous, which was not what we expected based on it being called just ""couscous""  * Crusted Chicken Romano  * Chicken Piccata - but the angel hair pasta was overcooked  * Chicken Parm Sandwich As I mentioned, the chicken dishes we've tried so far have mostly been wins. I am not a fan of white meat, finding it too dry and stringy, but here the chicken breast is almost always tender and moist. The worst chicken dishes we had here (Chicken Bellagio and Chicken di Pana) were still okay, just not as good as the others, and not good enough to have again. Some dishes we tried once and disliked:  * Fried mac and cheese balls (the Mac Daddy cheese balls at Fred 62 are much, much better)  * Burger - don't remember which burger exactly, but it was underwhelming for a restaurant burger; cooked to death (well past well done) even though we asked for it to be as rare as possible, but I understand that cooking ground meat to less than medium is scary for many restaurants (although if they are an A, I don't understand not being able to go to medium rare or medium).  * Chicken samosas were okay but with their egg roll wrappers and meat-only filling, not samosa-like enough. I want to try some of the other dishes, like the steak, but the chicken is so good I don't know when we'll get around to them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rancho-cucamonga?start=220,3.72,3.13,3.208,2.8960000000000004,3.366

Arrived to the location at 12:45 with my 36 guests, found my reservation is canceled and the patio is full of people, when I talked to the manager on duty his name was Jeff (I guess) he said sorry there is nothing we can do for you, and the wait for a party that big is about 2 hours.  My guests were doctors, lawyers, business men and women, and a TV station owner and producer. After my husband almost had a fight with Jeff the manager, we waited for an hour to be seated in a sad long table in the big patio with people all around us, service was horrible, as if you are sitting in a tacos truck in the street. The manager didn't even apologize, he probably felt as if he made us a favor by seating us. Dean the manager who I originally made the reservation with didn't call to follow up or apologize for what happened and the magnificent embarrassment they caused me in front of my whole family and friends, haven't heard from them until now.

We knew we'd have a wait since Sundays are usually busy at any resturant. I checked in and received a buzzer and was told an hour wait. Ok, we waited patiently, after and hour and 10 min passed I go to the he front counter and ask where I was on the list to get a table. I was told they were waiting for that table and the hostess pointed to a table full of people and said they have already paid we are waiting for them to leave. I sat and we waited longer, now an hour and a half wait I look at the table the hosted pointed to and no one has left. I ask again when will we be seated a different hostess tells me the same about waiting for the same table to leave. I let her know I was told that 20 minutes ago and no one has left. They bring a manager to speak to me since I was a ""party of more than 8"" she tries to tell me the same about waiting for the table to clear., I asked her  isn't there anywhere else, I've been told for 35min now that table is leaving and they haven't moved we've waited now overv1 and 1/2 hours. She says she'll see what comes up next that'll fit us. With in 10 min my buzzer goes off and we are seated (not at the table they kept pointing to). Also during our wait early on we ordered a  whole 7inch cheesecake from the cheesecake counter to celebrate my daughters birthday with. The lady at the counter says all their whole cakes are frozen and it will take 30 min to defrost. I told her that was ok, we haven't even been seated yet and that we wanted it after our meal, I paid $28 and change for a whole cheesecake and a white chocolate Happy Birthday plaque. We finally sit and we inform our waiter Cole M. That we ordered a whole cheesecake from the front counter and want it after we eat, he is aware. Cole M. was a great server and was very attentive with our drinks and needs. When it came time for our cheesecake, Cole went to get it from the front counter. He came back and apologized that our cheesecake was still completely frozen. I couldn't believe this since I had ordered it at least 2 1/2 hours ago. I took my receipt to the cheesecake counter and spoke to the lady who rung me up, she claims she took it out as soon as I ordered it, I explained to her it is still completely frozen and there is no way we can cut into it, she offered to cut it for us, I got the cheesecake and brought it to her, she says she'd have our waiter bring it to us once it's cut. 10 min later our waiter comes and apologizes for them not taking it out to thaw and they currently have my cake sitting on the expresso machine to help it thaw faster. Another 10min pass and our waiter brings out our slices of cheesecake again apologizing. This was the worst experience I have had at any cheesecake factory and by the time we left after being there for over 3 hours, I was to exhausted to even find a manager to speak to.

When it comes to their desserts I rotate between their fresh strawberry shortcake. It's large enough to split three ways with a giant sweet rock sugar coated scone split open & stuffed with a scoop of vanilla ice scream, fresh strawberries & loads of homemade whipped cream.

This particular location does the brand good. Two of their go to items are the Chicken Madeira and the Shrimp Bistro Pasta. Both are around $18. The chicken dish is wonderful, topped with a good sauce, cheese and Asparagus and served with mashed potatoes. The Shrimp dish is loaded with garlic, and is in a creamy, lemony sauce, served over perfectly cooked pasta. The bread basket is good with fresh whole wheat and sourdough loaves. The drink menu has a large selection of different choices. Closed the latest meal here with Raspberry Lemon and Classic Cheesecake. Scary good if you have a sweet tooth.

Oh, and how can I forget the complimentary bread basket! Everything was delicious. The nachos were so good! The chicken was yummy and way too much for one person and my son liked his sliders.

I will say that this has been worst experience I have ever had at Cheesecake Factory. I ordered the shrimp pasta off of the lunch special menu and let the waiter know that I did not want any cheese on my pasta and he let me know that it did not come with cheese and that the sauce was regular marinara sauce. I receive the pasta and it had cheese in the sauce, I sent it back and the waiter said he could bring me a new one with no cheese.  Pasta # 2, still had cheese in it, I let him know that I was not trying to be difficult but I absolutely could not eat any dairy. He suggested a shrimp pasta with just tomatoes and basil, before I accepted his suggestion I asked, ""will it be the same price as the original pasta I ordered?"" the waiter replied, ""Yes"".  By the time I received my food, it was 3:40pm and my friend had already finished her food.  I received my bill and the waiter charged me $15.95 for the last pasta I was given.  I told the waiter, that he made a mistake on the bill because he told me that last pasta he suggested cost the same as the original pasta I ordered which was $13.95.  He let me know that he would fix it. The manger Elva came to my table with a non sympathetic ""oh well"" type of attitude and told me that, $15.95 was the price of the pasta they suggested and that I would need to pay that price. She did not care that I was told something different. She showed no customer service skills and could care less if I was a returning customer.  I asked her for the corporate phone number to make a complaint. She didn't even have enough decency to come back to give me the phone number herself, she sent it with the waiter, along with my $15.95 plus tax bill. I don't understand why she could not have just honored what I was told. I feel that my whole view of cheesecake factory has now changed and Elva ""the manager"" is the reason.  I will say that the waiter did apologize but the fact of the matter is I was lied to and was the one to suffer for the lie I was told.

The filling was amazingly stuffed with vegetables, although the egg felt a little overcooked in my opinion, if it were a little more on the runny side it would've been better. The side fruits were my favorite and highlight of the dish since it had absolutely no melons (I'm allergic) by default and the fruits were all fresh rather than canned (LOVE!). The house potatoes were just mediocre though, I'm used to potatoes being baked/roasted/grilled but these were super deep fried (not a fan) instead.

182,Berlynn C.,"Chino, CA",105,2,,1.0,2016-12-28,"My family and I ate here last night it was our first time and we were excited to try it out. We arrived around 7:50 and it was extremely packed and were told it would be a 30-40 minute wait for our party of 5 and a child. So we seemed that was a fair time to wait since they seemed very busy. 8:30 comes around and we are starting to notice most of the parties that put their name in around the same time we did had gotten sat so we kept telling ourselves we should be next. When it hit 8:40 we went up to ask how much longer since we started to notice people that got there after us were getting sat. The hostess told us oh you guys are next. I am a server and understand how it is when it is busy but I began to get upset when I saw other parties of 5 getting sat. Now it's 8:50 and has been a full hour we are waiting so we go up again to ask and they tell us the same thing ""we're next"". I hate to complain but I felt it was time to speak to a manager. She apologized and sat us right away. She offered a complementary appetizer which I really appreciated and just hoped the rest of our visit would be great. Well, unfortunately it was not. Our FIRST server came up to us and grabbed our drink order right away and when she brought the drinks she said she would be back with bread and to take our order. She came back about 10 minutes later with another server and said she was going on break and the other server is taking over. That other server said hi and said she would be right back. Our complementary appetizer came out that was great but it was 9:30 and we had gotten sat around 9. Finally that server comes back and takes our order and brings bread after 30 minutes of being sat. My poor 7 year old brother was starving so we gave him bread to try to hold him off until the food came. The food begins to come out and of course my little brother's comes out last. So all of us are sitting there not eating until his food comes maybe about 5 minutes after the rest of our food. They did not even bring all his food they brought his chicken first then the fries a few minutes later. We were hoping the manager would come back and check on us to make sure the rest of our visit was better but she did not. After being there for almost 3 hours we did not want to take the time to find her again. Our first and last time that we will be coming here.

228,Adan ..,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,19,22.0,1.0,2017-01-11,"So we have been there two times in 3 weeks. So where do I begin? We showed up 3 weeks ago and they were busy, took an hour to sit us down. So we finally get seated and they took our order. First of all plates are anywhere from $10 and up and the portions are big. My problem started when I ordered the Kobe burger, I got it medium rare and twenty minutes passed by and nothing. My waitress came and let me know that they ""ran"" out of frozen meat for my burger.... what???!! Are you freaking kidding me? Why is my 18 dollar burger made out of a frozen patty at 18 dollars a plate specially a kobe burger? Anyway the manager came and apologized, she said she would comp my dinner since my wife's food came first. 5 minutes later my waitress came and said oh I heard we don't have meat to make ur burger, I said yes manager came already and she told me. My waitress seemed to be out of the loop and the manager never talked to her about it. I ended up eating 25 minutes after my wife so it kinda ruined date night. Today we went again because we got a bunch of giftcards for the place and my wife loves the food. Today we showed up and there was no one really there but still took 5 minutes to sit us and they sat someone before us who showed up literally 4 minutes after us all the hosted said was whoops you guys were here first right? I didn't even bothered and went along with it. We sat down and ordered, my wife's food was cold so she asked if they can reheat it for her, she took the plate back but once again it was another example of us eating separately. We flagged another waitress and asked for ours only to find out that "" our waitress"" was out on break but no one bothered tell us that she was going on break and someone else would help us. We never had our drinks refilled and I am tired of this place. They don't care about you the consumer but have no problem trying to up sell you on stuff! This was our date night again and it was ruined by poor service again. I will be contacting corporate and complaining! Dinner for two without drinks was 45 dollars and the food was cold and not even an apology!

As for appetizers, we got the deep fried avocado, portobello, and zucchini ""fries"". It was about $6.95 for a good amount, not too filling and probably about 3-4 pieces each. Comes with two dipping sauces as well.  As for entrees, for a party of three, we ordered Chicken Bellagio, Herb Crusted Salmon, and the Eggplant Parmesan. All good, favorite was the Herb Crusted Salmon though. The Chicken Bellagio was good but they ran out of arugula so the prosciutto was out of place.

52,Martina R.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,4,2.0,3.0,2017-03-02,"The Cheesecake Factory is a chain restaurant with good food and a superb dessert selection. The restaurant decoration is unique, artistic and very appealing. Let's start with the PROS:  -Desserts:! I'm in love with their cheesecake. Always flavorful, creamy and fresh. I also love their Strawberry Shortcake , it's to die for. Key Lime Cheesecake is quite different to other cheescakes I have tried. Finally, Banana Cream Cheesecake is just the best dessert in the world. Their entrees and appetizers also do the trick for me, I've tried many of them and they don't disappoint, main courses are good but not as good as the cheesecakes and desserts the restaurant sells. For main course I like the Bang Bang Chiken and Shrimp the most; it has a coconut curry sauce, rice and chicken. -Parking. I love being able to eat and not having to worry about my car being parked in the street. -Their drinks: The amount of alcohol the drinks have is huge. Get 2 Mai Thais and you'll be hell of drunk. The CONS: -Service: Does not match the food the restaurant has. -Wait: Always packed, they need to expand and make more space so that we do not wait 2 hours for a table. A few positive things and food bad ones, probably 3.5 stars would be fair if it was possible. Although the restaurant is not as bad as other chain restaurants still needs a lot of improvement to reach 5 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rancho-cucamonga?start=60,2.92,2.97,2.976,2.252,2.95

Our server didnt look happy, seemed too busy. Our waters came our after 10 min and the bread came out after 20 min with our appetizers. I had asked for lemon in my water, which didn't happen. The avocado rolls were good, but the main dish was too peppery. We asked for bread and that didn't come either, despite asking twice. during the time our waiter just passed us and didn't care to ask how we were nor any refills on drinks, etc. At the end, no dessert was asked he just gave us our check and left.

After 40 min , we got sitted, the waiter asked for our drinks, which took a while. Not even water was brought to our table or the pre- bread to stuff you up before the main course. 10 min. Later we saw another waitress and asked for our wine and beer.  We ended getting one water and our official drinks. We order the four cheese pasta to be shared between my SO and myself. I have gotten this meal before & this time around it didn't taste the same. Watered down, undercooked pasta and no taste to it. The service was bad. It was like we were put in a small corner & forgotten. Yes, I understand group customers are likely to be more important , but give us the same service as those who have a bullet bill because two people  can always leave a bigger tip. However, that's not the point.  The point is service should be the same , with respect. We didn't leave no tip. Because we had three or four different waiters.

It was just my husband and I, and we sat at our table for 30 minutes before being offered drinks. The waitress was kind of short with us but got nicer towards the end (aka tipping time). The food runners kept trying to give us wrong food (forcing us even). They would take the food back to the kitchen and send another runner out with the same wrong order. This happened three times! My food wasn't good either. The pasta tasted like it was boiled hours or days prior and left out to dry - very tough. The cheesecake slices are tiny, and now cost $8 each, but this is probably what all the locations are doing now. Refills were out of the question as the waitress made herself very scarce. Yes, the restaurant was busy. I don't understand why though. I will not be back here. We were in such a hurry to get out of there that my husband didn't notice his credit card wasn't returned to him.

144,Barbara F.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",740,127,780.0,2.0,2017-03-16,"So I have been coming here since they opened their doors about at least a decade ago and I can't believe this is my first time reviewing it. I frequently come here for dinners, birthdays, office lunches (here and at work), regular lunches, brunch, curbside to go etc. Ive rarely had issues and have always been a loyal customer. Last night wasn't the best experience. After a long day at work, I wanted to take a break from cooking dinner so my family and I can here. Let's start at the hostess table. I patiently waited my turn behind 2 groups of people. Somehow some girl sneaked in from the other side (which it was obvious wasn't the line) and instead of the ""male"" hostess attending to me since I had patiently been waiting, he decides to help her first. Strike #1. We sit down, order, and get some of our food. The fries my son got had plenty of burned (black) pieces of fries. He asked me ""Mom, why are they rotten?"" Strike #2. We get our bread and one looks as flat as a pancake and was very hard. Another one had a gaping hole in the center and was very hard. Strike #3. The server comes out with our food, and instead of placing it in front of me like every normal server, he holds it out and it stays suspended in front of me. Doesn't even courteously ask if I could take it from him. Anyways, I take it and set it in front of me. The other server who brought me my soup managed to set it in front of me and she was literally half his size. I even had to hand him my glass for a refill, which of course I don't mind doing but on top of that I had to hand him all of my plates for him to take all of this being asked of me by his ""give it to me"" hand gestures. I'm sorry but if I wanted to do all of this during dinner, I would have just stayed at home. Wow, just wow! Strike#4. The only reason why they get 2 is because the two new plates that we tried, the Carne Asada Medallion plate, and the Pineapple Shrimp and Chicken were good.

Unfortunately, when she ordered, our waitress, Whitney, informed that it was no longer on the menu. It was really the only reason we decided to go there in the first place. Whitney was kind enough to ask the chef if they can somehow make it but unfortunately the kitchen didn't have the ingredients. So, we ordered other items. We also ordered a bottle of wine. This was extremely disappointing because apparently the bottle was brought to our table already previously opened. When I noticed the lack of wine etiquette, Whitney said she didn't have a wine opener and had to borrow the bartender's. I don't agree with nor appreciate the lack of proper etiquette because I, myself, have been a bartender and waitress; therefore, it is simple wine etiquette that when a guest orders a bottle of wine, you present it, open it, and pour the first glass to taste. Whitney did not do any of this. Although she was nice, we felt this was a lack of customer service. All she offered was that if we were to get ANOTHER bottle that she would make sure to open it at our table. Again, dissatisfied with the response to this observation. About this time, Whitney introduced Suzy to take over. Another issue we had was when my mom got her amended order of the shrimp garlic pasta. It came with small steamed shrimp instead of grilled shrimp as she requested. Suzy was awesome. She apologized for the mistake and brought out the correct order. Overall, I don't think we will return to this location because the service has been much better at the other locations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rancho-cucamonga?start=220,2.88,2.79,2.996,2.052,2.8259999999999996

Well, after so many valid complaints the manager came and literally did not even apologized. He agreed on taking back 2 of the plates and asked the birthday girl if she was ok with her salad (the one where she found the bug) since she was eating it despite the fact the put aside the 4 legged friend.  I can't believe he (the manager) did not even apologized or insisted on taking that nasty bug of the table. I am extremely disappointed. He should have display a different approach since apparently someone in the kitchen, under his management, was not doing doing their job correctly.

She had been there several times before but it was my first time. I was impressed with the huge menu that had something to offer for everyone. We decided on Nashville chicken nuggets as an appetizer (which were great by the way) and after receiving our nuggets we felt as if we were forgotten about because our server hadn't checked on us for quite some time. We then started to look around and noticed that people who were sat while we were eating our appetizer were now receiving their meals and we were sitting in front of an empty table still. After attempting to be as patient as possible another 25 minutes passed by and we had to ask for the manager. The manager arrived just as our food did and assured us he would figure out what the issue was and how to resolve it. He came back to inform us that there was a misunderstanding about who our server was and that our order wasn't put in until just a few minutes before we received it. After apologizing several times he offered to box up our meals for us and assured us that customer service is usually much better and hoped we'd return to give them another chance.  Well, we will definitely be coming back to The Cheescake Factory to give it another shot because of the way that the manager handled the situation.

My husband was getting irritated , but I kept telling him they are probably busy even though most of the seating was open.  Then a waitress came over and asked if anyone has served us? We said no , so she said she would get the order for the other server. Then she ended up being our server.   Then our food never came out, she looked over at us and then said it was coming out soon. We continued to wait, then my food came out . My husband ordered the Cajun pasta with chicken and she brought his out without any chicken. We asked what happened , she said  she would get the order , then she came back and said they dropped the chicken.  Ok? So they couldn't make another dish or give us chicken and she apologized and said she would bring over a manager.  The manager came over and then said was there a problem , duh? What is going on?

Salads- come in servings that can feed 2 and each with a unique flavor. My favorites are the Chinese Chicken, Sheila's Chicken, Santa Fe and Cobb. Burgers- You gotta try a Kobe Burger. Pastas- Here is where you just pick one! I love them all. Jambalaya, Evelyn's, Louisiana Chicken, Farfalle w/chicken, spicy chipotle are all full of their own unique flavors. Desserts- can't go wrong with any of the cheesecakes but if you want something different, try the strawberry shortcake during strawberry season( April- July), great option. Also the lemon torte.

Went in with a girlfriend of mine at 7:30pm and was told the wait was an hour and a half. While that was quite steep we understood since it was mothers day weekend and waiting accordingly. When our table finally got called the time was 9:00pm so you can imagine we were starving at this point! Our waitress came around and dropped off our menu's and took our drink order. When she came back we told her we were ready to order. We ordered 1 appetizer and 2 entrees (the same dish). 30 mins later a food runner dropped off our appetizer. Our waitress NEVER came back to check on us till an hour later, and the only reason she did was because she was going on break and another waitress was going to be taking over. My friend and i were trying our best to be patient but an hour and half wait for food is just ridiculous! We asked our new waitress what was the ETA of the food, and that it had been an hour and a half at this point and she was in total shock as well that we had waited so long. The waitress came back with our ticket and said it must have gotten lost in the back somehow and was extremely apologetic and offered us a complimentary cheesecake. She even offered to get the manager for us. But that's where things turned. The manager came over, 'Issy' and we calmly explained to him that we had been waiting a total of 3 hours and just wanted to see what happened to our meals. He stated that he talked to his waitress and she said we NEVER order any entrees. Now why in the world would we sit at our table for an hour and a half never ordering a thing? His tone was absolutely appalling! Especially as a manger and was basically insinuating that we were lying. Horrible customer service on his part!  At that point we told them just send the check so we could get out of there. To add insult to injury this particular night we were celebrating my bday and being newly engaged!!!

They had us wait longer for another table.                 Finally we get buzzed again to say that our table was ready, we get seated and notice that the table wasn't even cleaned right. The table was all sticky, and the utensils that were supposedly ""cleaned"" were all dirty with a piece of lettuce on it. By then I was completely grossed out and didn't want to eat there anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rancho-cucamonga?start=20,2.28,2.56,2.916,2.436,2.448

121,Chris S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",38,40,114.0,2.0,2017-07-09,"Well my son wanted to have lunch here today, so I agreed. We have eaten here several times in the past but I had not posted a review, well today they get one and it is not so great.  I love appetizers and their menu has an array of them. I ordered fried zucchini, mozzarella and potstickers.  The fried zucchini was good, light and crispy  panko style breading and zucchini was firm inside. It was served with ranch dressing that was to thin and runny. The potstickers were good. Nice presentation. Soy based sauce with black and white sesame. I love the shaved green onions.  The fried mozzarella was for my son and he didn't like it. Served as triangles instead of sticks and had another cheese inside don't know what but texture and taste was different. I ate one and there wasn't a lot of cheese inside and what was there was was not mozzarella.  I didn't care for it either.  So my son ordered spaghetti and meatballs. He ate about half and said he has gad better. I have the roasted pear and blue cheese flat bread. That was good. I would order that again. It had roasted pears, pecans, arugula, blue cheese and grilled onions. It was a good bite.  I also chose to partake in their specialty martinis. I have a blood orange martini and it was very good, but real sweet. Then I had a well mannered dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives. That was not so good. It was off balance and I couldn't taste any alcohol. It tasted like dirty water. I ate the olives and passed on the cocktail. Got the bill. $13.50 for each of those martinis. I thought that was a bit excessive. Won't be drinking cocktails there. I would run out if money before I caught a buzz. We did get cheese cake to go for the boys after all it is the cheese cake factory and that is something they do do well.   Would I go back?  Hmm, it is a chain restaurant and mist of the time it is a hit or miss. Today was a miss, but I will probably go back but certainly not on a consistent basis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rancho-cucamonga?start=140,2.28,2.6,2.912,2.6320000000000006,2.472
72,Molly E.,"Upland, CA",4,20,,1.0,2017-07-14,"Okay. Long horrible story, but I will try to make it short. (It has taken me a while to write this and originally I had a dissertation below). But in a nutshell, I took my son to Cheesecake Factory in ""Victoria Gardens."" And it was a shit show. Literally lost my appetite, but stayed for my little guy because he was hungry and had waited long enough..... 1. The check in. They told me 25 to 30 min for a table. I was in front of the place at the 20 min mark and no buzzer was going off, but I took my son to the car to grab something... We walk back @ the 27 min mark and I was told they were buzzing me for 10 min and we lost our inside table and would have to be outside. That was a lie with the time. I even checked my phone from when the buzzer went off at my car. Nope... Needless to say, my son was excited to eat outdoors. So, I said fine.  2. We are seated. When the host is walking us to our seats (he was nice), I say to my son, ""We should have gone to the restroom before we were seated."" (I didn't realize how far the walk was going to be back through the crowd until we got to our table). We get water and PLACE OUR ORDER with our server. My son is super excited to order even more than what I initially ordered. I am thinking about washing our hands before we eat because we just went to the closed kid park where my son stuck his hands in the lack luster fountain/birdbath... I deleted 3 and 4... It involved the bugs outside. 5. There were quite a few bugs flying around so, my son and I go to the restroom to wash our hands. When we get to the restroom we both us it at the same time (different stalls). We wash our hands CORRECTLY, dry them, and head back to our table (all of 4 mins). When we get to the patio, my son says, ""They stole our table!"" And he says it really loud. I walk him back inside and a waiter says, ""Maybe you were at the other patio,"" and points us in a direction that confused me from where I had walked from. I go there anyway and it is totally not the right place and my son is saying ""NOOOOOOOOOO, they stole our seats""....... The whole time.  6. Seats taken. When I take a step into the dark covered patio, I walk out and have a chance to talk to my son again and explain to him that he is right. (I already knew he was right because I remember the ladies sitting between the boor and our table. They were dressed fully covered.) So, we walk back and I explain to a waitress that people are now sitting at our seat. She said she would find our waitress.  7. Seats taken 2. I see the waitress that claimed she was going to tell my waitress like 3 more times while I am waiting with my son at the door of the patio. He is hungry and frustrated and definitely feels cheated at this point and is asking a million questions about how people are allowed to steal seats from people. And asking why. ? ""Why are they allowed to take our seats? We had to wait for these seats outside because we were late for our inside seats. So why can they just take our seats? Why don't they tell them to move?"" 8. At this point several people in the bar area as well as where are seats were are just staring at us standing in the area by the door. A waiter ask me to move. I move, but then I just out loud where am I supposed to stand when our table now has people sitting at it. Two waitresses ask me about it (because my waitress never came over to deal with it). I explain to them what is going on and they go to find my waitress. 9. A man in a grey shirt comes back, does not introduce himself, and starts explaining how he has a table inside for us. And that there was a mix up. At this point I am so pissed with the shitty ass service, his lack luster approach to customer service, and I feel like really speaking my mind, but I hold it all in and now feel on the verge of crying.... This was literally the most embarrassing dining experience I have ever had. The whole freaking restaurant has been looking at me standing out of place for over 5 minutes (probably close to 10 mins like the hostess claimed they were buzzing us for) and you now have a table inside in the back of the restaurant.  10. I am going to wrap this up because it only gets worse. My server comes back saying a bus boy gave away our table because they just saw drinks there. Ducking liar. As a waitress you would have been checking on our table so you should have stopped anyone from moving our drinks. They bring bread.... And two seconds later some other girl comes around with a bread basket enough for ten people. I am like we just got bread. She gave me some creepy smile and then said, ""I was told to bring more."" WTF. Like bread gets rid of embarrassment. Bread gets rid of discrimination. I couldn't even eat. I was so disgusted and I had to wait 10-15 min for utensils. The manager had the audacity to come back and say, ""I am going to take care of you don't worry. Dessert is on me."" GTFOH with your dessert. I tried calling them, but no manager avail. I just plan to call corporate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rancho-cucamonga?start=80,2.24,2.56,2.904,2.5000000000000004,2.4320000000000004

I agree with others the price of cocktails are absurd here.  But I came for lunch and the ice tea gets free refills.  Tortilla soup. Excellent. Full of flavor and fresh vegetables.  Lunch special chicken piccata. Really good. Always one of my favorites however this time they forget the capers--the quintessential ingredient in a piccata. It was a good dish Nonetheless.  This place seems to get hammered with poor reviews due to being crowded and long wait times. This is pretty much the case for every Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to for dinner.

Tonight my husband and I decided to make it such a night. The wait wasn't horrible (40min) but when you wait that time, get called in stating your table is ready, then are told to wait again for someone to seat you (10 more min) is poor management. This was the practice for every customer. Once seated the waitress was very friendly but stated they were behind on the orders for bread. Ok, it's busy, I can deal with that. When the food finally came the server didn't know what table to bring it to. I had to flag him down stating that was our order. To top it all off, my Chinese chicken salad was chicken less. They offered to bring me out a piece of ""already cooked"" chicken from the back and since it had been sitting back there pre cooked it would take a min. At this point I was over the entire experience and very disappointed from what should have been a nice evening out to dinner. What has happened to our ""good restaurants""?

It was a very busy day as it was the day before Father's Day. We had a wait (about 20 minutes), as we were waiting for their big section for a large party. We ended up waiting about an hour because these two customers would not leave our section even though they were the only ones left. Cheesecake Factory did not want to kick them out, which is understandable. I felt like kicking them out myself! I did not though. I understand that people go eat and like to have conversations, maybe catch-up. But it is common courtesy that, if you see a bunch of people waiting to get a table, that you kind of speed it up and talk elsewhere.  They ended up seating us even though those two ladies were still there. Our servers, Leandra and Nick (I believe) were great. Leandra was our first server, and then Nick took over once she left. However, my mother-in-law's meal did not come along with everyone else's. The manager came to speak to her and apologized that a mistake was made. He gave her something for free. It was a very large party and very busy, so I can understand that mistakes are easy to make. Overall, good job Cheesecake Factory!

Every time I call for curbside pick up the hostess is incredibly rude when she transfers to the bakery. Usually the bakery takes about 5 minutes to take the order. Today I called 3 separate times Bc I was on hold for 10 minutes each time. I would understand if I called during the lunchtime rush but I called at 1:45 pm. The last time I called I tried to have the hostess take my order but she immediately transferred me again to the bakery.

180,Jera D.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,5,,1.0,2017-09-07,"This place needs major help. It was Mom's 66th birthday with a total of 8. It's a Thursday night at 9. How bad can it be? Definitely seemed understaffed which led to a 20-30 minute wait, which the hostess mentioned that she needed to ask for a manager to offer a wait time, when I asked what the wait time would be (okie). I accepted that there was a wait. I get called back up to confirm my phone number. Confirmed and sit back down. Cool. They will text when our table is ready. Except 30 minutes went by and still no text / table. My sister went up to ask because at this point its 9:30PM. No one is in the place. Their response: it will be about 15 more minutes to set up the table, which our reaction would be like any normal person's reaction: holy cow 20 to 30 to 45 when no one is there Hahaha! Crazy thought. Open tables all around. People ate and left in the time that we were waiting.  Getting a little frustrated we discussed the fact that maybe we should just do take-out. I asked for menus and we browsed. The man then says ma'am they are setting the table it up. My reaction, again, like any normal person, ""it's been 45 minutes. This is unacceptable. No one is even here"". We start browsing menus and I get up to see if the table is still being prepared. I was then told by the hostess, ""Oh you grabbed menus for takeout."" We didn't think you wanted it anymore "". And repeated and repeated in a rude and condescending way of course, which I then said yes, thank you, is the table available?"" So they said, yea would you like to be seated?"" Would I like to be seated??!!! Like any normal person: What have I been waiting for 50 minutes on???!!! Am I right?! Then I said I would, but I'd like to speak to a manager first. And he was  right there. This whole time this jack rabbit had been listening and didn't think to intervene. Then I said, ""we been waiting for a table for about 50 minutes now. Couldn't someone approach us and ask if we did want the table after all"". The ""I'm the manager"" was already in a manner that you wouldn't say wow this guy is a professional, but then proceeded to flat out argue the fact that I didn't want a table because he saw that I got take-out menus. 1. Don't argue with an upset customer 2. Diffuse the situation and check in with people. Don't assume. Anyways, after everyone heard his arguing with me and just the exhaustion from the whole ordeal, we were ready to just leave. Yard House is a hands-down better choice. Don't waste a second on this place. Hopefully this will catch the attention of someone in upper management because this wasn't the first time leaving upset here for me and people don't want to pay for a $50 cheesecake and 20% gratuity to be told off while waiting the whole night.

127,DiAnna A.,"Long Beach, CA",1,3,,1.0,2017-09-16,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory yesterday as it's one of my favorite places to go for Happy Hour from time to time.  However on this occasion I found hair in my food. After quietly informing the server I just asked for a simple replacement. Shortly thereafter I was greeted by a very tall Male manager informing me ""it was part of the dish and not hair, also stating it happens all the time."" He then proceeds to say he will take it off the bill and replace the food.  It was never taken off the bill however it wasn't ever a money issue as much as a service issue. I'm fully aware that ""Great Service beats out poor food any day."" I come from the industry and worked years in NYC 5-star restaurants so to be told that the obvious hair wasn't hair yet part of my dish was highly disappointing. I'm very familiar with the dish as I have ordered it for years, as well as the preparation it takes to make the dish so I was knowledgeable as to knowing it was hair. Yet I didn't want to be difficult so I just agreed and said a replacement would work perfectly.  I was sent out half of my replacement with no garnish and when I said that I barely ate any of my dish and I'm receiving half I was told ""this is all I was told to replace."" I then had to explain the situation which made it seem as if I was begging for extra food just to get the appropriate replacement.  I finally received the rest of the replacement just thrown in a to go box, again no garnish like the original.  I informed my server that I was very disappointed by the way the situation was handled. Instead of trying to make the situation right all I got was a ""I'm sorry, come see me again I'll take care of you."" I don't see that to be true when the first time was a disappointing experience. I'm not naming names because I don't want anyone to get into trouble however I would just use this as feedback for better staff and management training.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rancho-cucamonga?start=140,2.84,2.53,2.852,2.6280000000000006,2.654

We were seated promptly at our time of reservation, and things started going downhill from there.  When we all put in our orders, my dad, whose birthday it is, specified he would like his dish served hot. It took about 40 minutes for us to receive our food, AND although the plate itself was very hot, his food was cold.  We sent it back and the waitress offered to remake it, saying it would only take 10 minutes. 20 minutes later, the rest of us have finished our food while my dad is still sitting there, hungry. He told the waitress to cancel the order as we'd already finished our meals and he'd feel uncomfortable eating his food while we watch on for another 20 minutes. We asked to speak to the manager. 10 minutes later, still no manager, so we ask a server passing by for the manager. Neither the manager nor the waitress were apologetic. The manager admitted they had been having that problem today, but did not explain how he'd go about resolving it.  It's my dad's birthday, and on his birthday he watched his entire family eat a meal he was very much looking forward to, without him. Although we specified that this was a birthday occasion, no cake was brought out, no song was sung. Other tables celebrating birthdays got that special treatment, while we did not, although we had made reservations a few days in advance specifying it was a birthday occasion.

After 45 minutes, I finally asked another waitress to check on our food... and with an attitude she said that they are very busy because of the 1/2 off cheese cake.

Before we traveled home we decided to grab lunch at The Cheesecake Factory (TCF). It is always good for a good meal and the menu offers a wide variety. It was about 11:30, and we were set at a booth right away. Our waiter, Ian, greeted us right away and got us set up right away with my very favorite, Green Iced Tea, and my husband, his usual dark diet soda and ice water. Mind you, I have dined at TCF many times, however I was immediately impressed by Ian's attention to detail. At this point, he even asked whether I'd like my tea with sweetener or on the side. In the course of our normal ordering conversation, Ian pointed out the brunch offerings located on a separate card within TCF's already comprehensive menu. We decided on Chicken Samposas as an appetizer. I chose the Monte Cristo Sandwich served with breakfast potatoes and my husband ordered a BBQ Burger and fries. Everything was so delicious and served with the utmost quality and level of personal service. Our drinks were refilled without asking, our tabletop kept clear of plates unintrusively as we finished aspects of our lunch. Even when Ian bade us farewell as he was going to have his own lunch, we were graciously handed off to Danielle who maintained the same level of service us us.  Though we ordered appetizers, my husband quickly devoured his meal and began to covet my extraordinary sandwich with his eyes. Knowing I was growing more full by the moment I offered a quarter of my sandwich, complete with a little dollop of the strawberry preserves (yes, I do love this man). His eyes rolled over in appreciation for my excellent lunch selection. I quickly assessed my stomach capacity; I would have room for the rest of my sandwich, but not my breakfast potatoes!  He could fill up on those. We were both well sated at the conclusion of our meal. Danielle asked if we had any room for dessert and we hastily declined (because I was so full-more food seemed out of the question). Danielle teased us to take dessert home for later, and again we declined. Instead, Danielle prepared my wondrous Iced Green Tea in a to-go styled cup and straw and we were on our way. I didn't quite make it out to the car without feeling that moment of regret, Why didn't I bring dessert home?! Good as it gets, I don't usually go to the mat and give out ""Excellent"" on my reviews; however Ian and Danielle with TCF food made this Saturday an excellent dining experience.

I almost didn't want to go, due to the low rating, but we were getting only pre-movie drinks and an appetizer, so you know, $25 off, why not? We sat in the bar for prompt service. The bartender was a master of her craft. I got a perfect mojito, and my husband got a perfect margarita.  We ordered the Calamari, because we love calamari, and that's what we order when we are in celebratory mood (I had won a costume contest, after all) and I have to say it is definitely in the top 3 calamari experiences of my entire life.  The outside was crispy, but not too crunchy. The inside was DOWNRIGHT BUTTERY! Not the slightest bit rubbery whatsoever. There were both the rings, and the intact tiny squids we all know and love. I generally avoid the red cocktail sauce in favor of the white sauce, but at the urging of my husband, I was pleasantly surprised and I can say without a doubt that that is The Best cocktail sauce (the red dipping sauce if that's what it's called) I have ever had. It was tart, with just the whisper of a spicy kick.  The portion was so generous, we had trouble finishing it between the two of us. It's probably, seriously 13 years since I've had its equal.

Chicken Madeira, Lemon Herb Chicken, Calamari, Pear/Arugula/Bleu Cheese Flatbread, and Kids' Roadside Sliders.  My husband loved the Chicken Madeira. The chicken was moist and tender, and the sauce was very flavorful. The Lemon Herb Chicken on the other hand was overly tangy. My daughter  has had a similar dish from other restaurants, and the previous ones she had had just a hint of lemon, not overpowering. I was pleased with the calamari, although I have had better dishes. I truly enjoyed the pear, arugula, and bleu cheese flatbread. It was light, but filling enough. Loved the combination of pecans and pears. My son was satisfied with his sliders.  To top of our dinner, we ordered a slice of Mango Key Lime Cheesecake to share. I would have preferred fresh mango slices on top instead of mango jelly/gelatin; it tasted artificial to me. My boys enjoyed it, though.  All in all, the dining experience was pleasant enough.

23,Darien C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3017,223,141.0,4.0,2017-12-03,Service has definitely improved here! Visited a few times and I only dine in the bar area now. The waiters are much more attentive and friendly here and the speed of receiving drinks and food is much quicker than dining in the other areas of the restaurant! I came here this past Friday night for dessert and not surprising - they were busy. We did end up putting our name in with the host but kept our eye on the bar area since that is the only place I really like sitting at now. It took maybe 15 minutes but we did grab a table from another couple that were leaving.  A bus boy came right away to clear the previous guests dishes and wipe down the table. A few minutes after we sat down a waiter came by to let us know he would be back to take our drink order. Even though the bar area was full he was pretty attentive during our visit. Kevin P was the one who served us during our visit and he was great! He would stop by to check on us but not intrude too often.  I ordered the Chocolate hazelnut crunch cheesecake which is basically a Nutella cheesecake. It is super sweet! As are all of their cheesecake options but this one was covered in a thick layer of Nutella on the top that made me feel like a sugar rush would stay in my system for weeks to come! Definitely need a large glass of water to go with any of their desserts because the sweetness will overwhelm you after a few bites.  It's so sweet I even wondered if it is better to share one of their slices of sugar heaven. And sharing food isn't one of my favorite things to do! The desserts are cut big enough to share with someone if you've already eaten an entree too so keep that in mind.  Overall I am upping my previous rating to 4 stars because of them improving! I have yet to eat in their main dining area but I am content with the bar area because I have received good service there. Will continue to come here mainly for dessert! Good on them for being able to convince me that they deserve better a better rating and more visits to come!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rancho-cucamonga,3.28,2.69,2.792,2.576,2.926

It's chicken breast, in a delicious wine sauce, topped with cheese, mushrooms, and asparagus. It is served with mashed potatoes. Lastly, if you are a chocolate lover the Oreo cheesecake is the best. I also love the fresh banana cheesecake. I gave this place 4 stars and honestly I was leaning toward 3, but it is my favorite place to eat.

Last night daughter had a large hair on top of her Salmon as it was put in front of her . She  Pointed it out to the waitress and was told she would get another however waitress left the disgusting plate in front of my daughter and came back in over 5 mins to pick it up  ? Waitress promised to get another plate on the fly . 2nd plate came at a regular time as I slowly finished mine waiting for her to be served . When check cAme was told by Waitress  that she charged us for 3 and took off the extra one .  I was disappointed there was no discount or offer to make it right and yet to point out you charged us for 3 and took off one ?? How generous not to charge us for the 3rd one . We gave our card to pay And decided when waitress cAme back that this just seem right . So asked her if Manager could  come over he didn't come till over 5 mins and his name was ""John"" he was very condescending and it was brought to his attn about what happened . He explained about the 3rd charge of the salmon was for them to monitor their inventory. He offered free cheesecake my daughter  stated no thank you I don't like cheesecake . Your cheesecake is 6.00 my salmon was 19.99 how does that compare  John said well we already charged your card there is nothing I can do . Really John that's your response ? We left with the same bill at the same price . I am extremely Sad and disappointed . Hoping that someone with much more Power than John reads this and determines this wasn't handled appropriately . With many years of experience of eating in restaurants this was handled poorly from the start . Mistakes happen and we can overlook the hair , but to leave the plate and wait for them to remove it Yuck!!!!

106,Katrina R.,"Yucaipa, CA",0,5,,4.0,2018-01-07,"The food was so good, even though we waited almost an hour for a table we will still go back. Weekends are busy, next time will definitely go back during the week. Our waiter was fantastic. The only bad thing i have to say is that they're unorganized when it comes to having guests wait. They were paging people and then having groups of people wait in a main walking area for servers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rancho-cucamonga?start=40,2.72,2.73,2.756,,2.726
51,Danya D.,"Duarte, CA",1,9,2.0,1.0,2018-01-07,"I was very disappointed with my experience tonight. I came with my three kids because I wanted to give them a small treat before going back to school. There was a 45 minute wait, which is not very pleasant but understanding when they are trying to accommodate a big crowd. Then after I received my food, the shrimp was over cooked and the plate looked and tasted almost like a microwave dinner. I didn't think it was necessary to pay $20 for this so they offered to bring me another plate, but I ordered something different. I asked them to put it in a to go box because I was with three kids and they were already getting really impatient. When I got the bill I was disappointed because they didn't try to compensate for ruining my experience. When I asked to speak to the manager they offered me a piece of cheesecake, but I didn't want cheesecake.  I felt that they could have done more to resolve this issue.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rancho-cucamonga?start=60,2.64,2.7,2.768,,2.676
25,Dawn S.,"San Francisco, CA",143,82,88.0,1.0,2018-01-07,"The definition of bad service. Came here at 4:30Pm to grab a table, they do not take reservations. Waited an hour. Sat down for ten mins. The waiter that was supposed to serve us, looked at us and walked away didn't even say hi or serve us water. I had to flag another waiter down and tell him the situation. I don't get why he was serving the tables surrounding us makes eye contact then ignores us. Food was good, portions are huge. People next to us were huge too, so i guess it blends in. Poor chair, looked like it was about to break. Definitely should have ordered one plate per four people. Loved the 1,300 calorie cheesecake. delicious. Bought an entire cheesecake to bring home. Ghetto wide chicks in the bathroom taking selfies and holding up the line when there's two empty stalls. If you cut them because they expect you to wait for their selfie time to finish....they yell ""THERE'S A LINE."" ""DAMN JOCELYN, you a thug.""

29,Colleen E.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",15,22,10.0,2.0,2018-01-10,I tried Cheesecake Factory back when they opened and was not really impressed. I have heard all these great comments about it the last few years so I decided to try it again last night.  Well my friend and I ordered the California Cheesesteak sandwich based on the picture on the internet and description listed. I also ordered the spicy tortilla soup. The soup was totally tasteless and not spicy. The sandwiches did not look like the internet. The bell peppers were extremely hard to find. The cheese tasted like velveta and I hate that taste. The coffee had grounds at the bottom of the cup. The waitress acted like a chicken with her head cut off. Needless to say I will not be going back anytime soon,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rancho-cucamonga,2.6,2.74,2.748,,2.684
1,J W.,"San Bernardino, CA",2,98,59.0,3.0,2018-01-10,"I'm a little disappointed.. I ordered chicken quesadilla for appetizer, and extra bread  however, it took so long that it came with my main entree. I asked if they would take it back because at that point everyone's food was there. I'm guessing because the place was extra packed. But I can attest that I usually have better service. I can't say I won't return but if I see it that busy I'll just come at a less busy time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rancho-cucamonga?start=20,2.56,2.73,2.74,,2.662
32,Reyna G.,"Rialto, CA",0,6,2.0,3.0,2018-01-10,I like the chicken Alfredo delicious but they take too long to get your order omg the blended Georgia peach alcohol drink is s o good. I always ask for more brown dark bread but they never bring it  they bring me more white bread I tell them and they say they will take a while to cook it and they always get my order wrong but I like some food there the cheese cake good but not as good as the Costco one . Oh Fried macaroni and cheese  balls really good and the Caesar said really good with the Caesar or ranch on the side cause they add to much dressing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rancho-cucamonga,2.56,2.73,2.74,,2.662
37,Matmarv B.,"Corona, CA",0,7,,5.0,2018-01-11,"HE ISTHE MAN! It was my brother's 40tj birthday and we decided to celebrate at this Cheesecake venue. It was already 530 pm and dinner was in full swing. I told the hostess that we were a big party of 8 adults iwith two small kids. The hostess notified Mr. Derrick, the night's manager and he immediately explained the situation that it might be an hour wait or less. I suggested he can break our party into two and he promised to be ""creative."" It was not even that much of a wait and we were seated on two tables right across each other. I observed him during the next half an hour, walking around, helping his entire team of smooth flow,. He was non stop delegating his orders with so much efficiency till he was perspiring on a winter night.  His work ethics and leadership was impeccable and I salute him for his hard work, courtesy and professionalism. Our server Marina provided a stellar service too. Nothing was amiss from drinks, bread, dessert and main dishes were delivered timely. The food  was very consistent of Cheesecake high standard. Salute to the kitchen staff, Marina and Mr. Derrick! All their hard days work made my brother's birthday even more special! Thank you so much for a another round of great experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rancho-cucamonga,2.68,2.77,2.744,,2.734
27,Regina D.,"Sparks, NV",5,26,2.0,5.0,2018-01-12,Stopped here to have lunch with a friend the wait time was at least 30-45 mins but that seems pretty normal for Southern California. Our waitress was attentive even though it was packed so that was definitely appreciated! The avocado egg rolls and the spaghetti and meatballs were amazing!!!
