265,Mimi J.,"Bakersfield, CA",774,1295,3576.0,4.0,2012-01-02,"It's been years since I've been to a Cheesecake Factory restaurant, but the memories were pleasant so I was looking forward to my return visit.  The decor is simply amazing - upscale yet not intimidating, the lighting and layout (heavy on the booths) made for an intimate setting perfect for couples, families, or large gatherings of friends.   There was a bit of a wait to be seated, but then it was New Years Day and there were plenty of us waiting to sample the food and the waiting area had plenty of comfortable benches.  The hostesses and servers were pleasant, attentive, but unobtrusive.  The drink orders were quickly taken and basket after basket (after basket) of hot fresh bread - both white and dark (Squaw bread perhaps?) arrived at our table. The menu was extensive and carried a wide variety of American homestyle favorites, from grilled cheese, to burgers; from salads to pastas and meatloaf.  There is something here to please just about everyone. We started our meal with the Avocado Eggrolls much I must say were truly amazing.  Smooth and creamy on the inside and a crispy golden brown crunch on the outside.  I have always been a big fan of Avocado Eggrolls, but what made these special was the dipping sauce made from tamarind and cashew - a unique blend of flavors that made a big impression on me.  Seriously - once the eggrolls were gone, I was dipping bread into the dip so as not to waste a drop. I had the chicken enchiladas with black beans, corn salsa, and lime cilantro rice.  Wow.  I like all three of them, but it was the lime cilantro rice that really stood out. One of my friends spoke very highly about his Orange Chicken.  I didn't try it, but I could see it was comprised of large chunks of crispy battered chicken - mmmmm.. I only wish we'd saved room for dessert but - alas - it was not to be.  Next trip!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rancho-mirage?start=260,3.4,3.4,3.4,3.024,3.4000000000000004

I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in over 5 years.  Anyway, this review is just for the Spinach and artichoke dip - very good!  Comes with chips and not bread which I like.  The seating was quick and the lighting is dim and relaxing, really nice atmosphere.  The place seems huge, but maybe that's how they all are?  Anyway, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but if you're in the area, I would recommend it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rancho-mirage?start=320,3.4,3.4,3.4,2.9600000000000004,3.4000000000000004

332,Linda K.,"La Quinta, CA",0,2,,4.0,2012-01-31,"We dined there on 1/30/12. As always, the food and service was great.  The key to enjoying Cheesecake Factory is to go early because regardless of what restaurant you go to, when there are over 40  people waiting in line to get seated, something or everything will suffer. My issue with the Rancho Mirage location, is the booth seating comfort level.  The cushions need desperate help!! Guests may as well be sitting on TOP of the marble tables because there is NO upholstery or padding left to the seat-cushions.  We couldn't even sit there long enough for dessert or conversation. This is inexcusable for a restaurant, in my opinion. Comfort is a key element in having your guests enjoy the food and ambiance.  I have emailed the location, so I hope something gets done sooner, rather than later.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rancho-mirage?start=340,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.9920000000000004,3.2800000000000002

329,Ashlyn S.,"Rancho Mirage, CA",1,1,,3.0,2012-02-20,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory for a valentines date with my boyfriend. As we sat down we didn't have silverware, so a man grabbed some from the back. I noticed right away the silverware felt greasy and my boyfriend had white food on his fork and spoon. We were both grossed out and we returned the silverware to our waiter. He didn't apologize and he seemed mad that we returned the silverware.  When we got our water glasses mine was covered in white goo. Gross! When our waiter went to take our orders he seemed rude. He was making remarks about what I wanted to order. The four cheese pasta, without chicken. He seemed mad I didn't order chicken. I wonder why? My boyfriend didn't like how he was acting to me so he ordered chicken enchIladas WITH chicken. With emphasis on the chicken. The waiter picked up on his sarcasm and seemed to relax. He was nice from then on. No problems after that at all. the food was good and the cheesecake was excellent. My only other comment is that three waiters walking by dropped three glasses or plates.

Of course it is about 100Degrees outside so not sure if many people do that during the day. The menu is great. There is something for everyone here. I got the Teriyaki Chicken. Its served with Rice, grilled pineapple, grilled bananas. It tasted different then the one I get from the Cheesecake I normally go to. But it didn't taste bad.  Portions are very big here, which is always a plus. Got a nice cold corona on that hot day and it totally hit the spot.  Our waitress had a bit of an attitude, then she changed her shift and the nice waiter took care of us great.. by the time we were paying the attitude women came back!

280,Cat L.,"Kailua, HI",32,32,2.0,2.0,2012-05-05,"I've been to a Cheesecake Factory once before and I didn't remember being bad but I regretted coming here instead of to Olive Garden. Everything is not only pricey but the food has the same taste and poor quality like that of a TGI Friday's or similar restaurant. I got the nachos and seriously, if you don't eat them within 5 minutes, they cheese turns rubbery and hard. I was disappointed because they put very little cheese on it so most of it was just tortilla chips with some sour cream, thin chunks of chicken, and guacamole. I ended up getting the burger sliders they have in the appetizer menu. I don't know if it was me or the food but they tasted disgusting and the cheese smelt rotten. I've honestly never been one to complain at a restaurant, I'm either too embarrassed or do it out of respect for the people that work. But I actually complained to my waitress and the manager stopped by and was really nice about it. She didn't charge me and offered something complimentary but I didn't take it. I must of had a poor memory of the first time I ever came to one of these restaurants since I was so excited about the cheesecake. Another let down :/ I got the original cheesecake and it's not what I expected or wanted. It has an almost bitter flavor because of the sour cream (or whatever the thin layer of cream on top of it is).  At least I got good service from the waiter and manager.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rancho-mirage?start=280,3.48,3.48,3.48,2.6960000000000006,3.4800000000000004

347,Rae T.,"Moreno Valley, CA",272,352,708.0,2.0,2012-06-16,I am giving two stars just because we had excellent service. Unfortunately the food was bad. I ordered the fish n chips lunch which came in tiny overcooked nuggets. The batter was tough and drenched in oil. I ate the fries and left the fish and the bland coleslaw. Such a waste of 11.50. My friend paid for the meal so I did not feel right complaining about the meal plus I had lost my appetite anyways. As we sat and talked a bit longer we ordered cheesecake. Mine was overly sweet but my friend enjoyed his oreo cheesecake. The service was one of the best I had ever had. The server brought out a plate of fruit and bread for my son to keep him occupied while we were waiting for our food since this is one of few establishments that do not provide coloring material with the kids menus.

It is HUGE! It is literally a mountain of food. It's a big whopping Mt San Jacinto of food. Imagine someone's girlfriend asking for this, trying to show she has a dainty appetite, and then looking like a PIG! Ugh! It is literally a foot high and is topped with crispy white rice noodles.

240,P S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,4,,2.0,2013-01-07,"I went here yesterday while visiting the Rancho Mirage area. This was one of the worst restaurant experiences I've had. I've been to Cheesecake Factory in other places and liked it, but this location gave me a bad experience. First, they sat our group in a booth, facing a window where the sun was brightly shining in our eyes. I literally had to wear my sunglasses in order to try to cope with the extreme sun, which was still not enough, I still had to cover my face with my hand. The screens for the windows were apparently up but this did nothing to shield the sunlight in any way. In addition to that, I had an extreme headache, so this bright sun in my eyes was really not helping. The waitress did not even acknowledge the sun in our eyes, nor offered to have us move to another booth.  It was not until we got our food that one of the people who served us our food apologized for the sun, yet did nothing about it.  We were stuck with the sun in our eyes for the whole meal. Second, I ordered a lemonade for a drink, and I noticed brown specs in my drink. I have no idea what it was. I managed to take some of it out with my straw, and it was just gross, I didn't even know what it was. Third, I ordered the chicken parmesan sandwhich, and while I was eating it, I noticed little fuzzies(?) or lint-like hairs, all over the bread of my sandwich. I'm not sure what it was, but I did not like seeing it on my sandwich.  Fourth, I asked for a water at the end of our meal. I was given iced water in this mug type cup. As I was drinking, I noticed a lipstick stain on the cup. That is when I had it. That just drew the line, because that it just disgusting. They didn't even wash the cup well enough, who knows what else wasn't clean. Really bad experience at this place. I will not be eating at this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rancho-mirage?start=240,3.08,3.08,3.08,2.8240000000000003,3.0800000000000005

It is reminiscent of a Vegas restaurant. I am in love with the skinnylicious menu. Healthy, flavorful food, with cheesecake portions around 400-600 per entree.  The enchiladas, artichoke, tropical chicken (?) and chick salad sandwich were all outstanding.  The veggie escabeche that came with the enchiladas was incredibly delicious and gourmet. The river is touristy but over all a great place to go eat.

A big mistake it was for us.....my daughter who order what she usually does (at the CC in Sherman Oaks) chicken alfredo got very sick in the middle of the night at our hotel. She ran to the bathroom just in time as she vomited profusely! Poor thing she kept saying it was the pasta mommy!!  We should have took the hint when we first entered the restaurant and exited.

Today the corporate office called me however I missed the phone call. I then called them back and as of this writing I have not heard back from corporate office.

Now it seems everything about it is going downhill. I even tried three different times to see if I can get a better experience. It makes me very sad to post this review. But being the Yelper that I am, it's important to share. The location is beautiful; it's the highlight spot within the River at Rancho Mirage. Waterfront seating on the patio, beautiful landscaping, and trendy shops all around.  That's about all I can say that is positive. We were escorted to our table, and it looked like a few spots were missed when they wiped the table off. The floor underneath our table was full of food crumbs. Believe me, I wasn't trying to look for it, but since there was no table cloth the food crumbs on the floor were very visible. Our waters had no ice and didn't taste very refreshing.  I ordered the Well - Mannered Dirty Martini and although there was a little spillage when the waitress set my drink down, I did enjoy it along with the Blue Cheese stuffed Olives that came with it. For appetizers, we had the Avocado Eggrolls and felt like they were bland. Even the Cilantro sauce seemed a little dull? We tried the Factory Burrito Grande and we were very disappointed. The burrito looked like it was sitting under a heat lamp way too long, the ends looked dehydrated and overall unappealing.  Inside there was very little meat and too much dried out rice. At this point we were too discouraged to even want to try the Cheescake, which was a huge disappointment. Overall WAAYY expensive for the quality of food and the dining experience we received.  In my humble opinion, the Cheesecake Factory has some high management issues and lost their strive to be the excellent dining establishment they once were.  I doubt I will ever go back to The Cheesecake Factory again.   :-(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rancho-mirage?start=140,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.7600000000000007,3.2000000000000006

She rarely checked up on us. The food was quite honestly salty. My fiancé had the seafood and chicken jambalaya. It was oily and salty. I had the mac n cheese burger with fries. My fries were super cold and I wanted to complain to my waiter but she was never around and I was too hungry to wait for them to bring me new fries.

We were running late having dinner and wound up here at 8:45. My wife and I both ordered well done steaks. Both steaks came out almost an hour later and both were rare. The server took them back for more time on the fire. The steaks came back out, and still weren't well done but considering how hungry we were, we decided to eat them. I've had tough steaks a couple of times in my life but this was the first time I had a steak so tough I literally could not chew it. It was hands down the absolute worst steak I've ever had in my life. Unfortunately, that was not the only issue we had tonight. When they brought the steak back out, they also brought fresh fries but for some reason decided to use the same onion rings. And the green beans that seemed pretty decent, lost their appeal quickly, when halfway through we found a hair. Needless to say this was our first and last time at a cheesecake factory. The thing that really stinks is that by the time this played out,  all the other restaurants were closing, so there were no other meal options.  Thanks a lot cheesecake factory for ruining our last night out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rancho-mirage?start=320,3.32,3.3,3.3,2.8240000000000003,3.3080000000000003

309,Miguel R.,"Yucca Valley, CA",0,8,2.0,1.0,2014-06-17,"I had heard so much about this place. Various friends had recommended it and made it seem like it was worth it; it was, to some extent. Some friends and I visited the place to have dinner. We were greeted with a big smile and were seated almost right away. We ordered our drinks and appetizer, lettuce wraps, and they were good. Plating could have been a little neater and organized, but we dove in right away. The menu was really long, it had almost every plate imaginable, so it took us a while to decide on an actual entree. They offer sandwiches, burgers, salads, pastas, if I well recall they offer pizzas, soups, Mexican, and tons of other dishes that do not fall under the category that the place is listed as, new/traditional American.The server came once in a while and asked if we were ready, she always had a decent and jocund tone. After several minutes of deliberation we decided, I ordered BBQ Chicken Salad. When the plate arrived, I was surprised at the image before me. The plate was dead. The colors were not vibrant and vivacious as other salads I had eaten before. The lettuce was not crisp and green, instead it was yellowish, as if it had been exposed to air for a while, and it was a bit soggy. The tomatoes were a shade of light red, instead of the vivid red tomatoes usually are. The onion rings were cold, as if they had been cooked an hour or so before the salad was plated. And the chicken. Oh, that chicken. It was, in one word, bland. It had no flavor whatsoever. It tasted as frozen. Not even the BBQ sauce made up for the blandness of the whole salad. I put some salt to it and it did not fix anything. One of my friend's ordered a breaded chicken breast, and his plate also looked dead, and the chicken had, again, no flavor. HIs greens were tasteless; the only good thing on this plate were the loaded mashed potatoes. The chef has to much to deal with, the massive menu. They should cut back on so many unnecessary foods. I understand they may have a large menu to accommodate the grand variety of palettes, but it's working against them. They should focus only on two things, American food and cheesecakes, that's it.

I've had their cheesecakes before, but it's been a while. I took my mom as well to try and get her to eat. She wanted the soup, but they only had one soup. I wish they had a bigger selection on soup. I understand it's called Cheesecake Factory, so they specialize in cheesecake but really one soup? She didn't like anything on the menu, she's picky so it's hard. I know she loves bread (she'll eat loaves of bread like chips which is quite odd in my opinion). So I asked for a side of bread, my mom liked the bread. I tried it and it was really yummy. Anyways I mainly wanted to write this review about their cheesecake. They have a pretty huge selection. I didn't know what to get, but I was craving white chocolate so I got the white chocolate caramel macadamia but cheesecake. I was tired too so I decided to get coffee with my cheesecake. The coffee was whatevs (it taste like coffee from regular coffee you brew at home). The cheesecake was really sweet, but in my opinion the macadamia but to cheesecake ratio was too much. They put too much nuts and they added way to much whip cream. Whip cream is good, but they added it on tripod the cheesecake and then to the side (which is way to much!). Another thing I want to add is that the cheesecake was really sweet, probably too sweet. I don't recall cheesecake being that sweet. I felt like it was too much for me to be honest (I could probably only eat half of that cheesecake slice) Also our server was really nice! However I changed my mind because she kept walking by our table and didn't ask us if we wanted any more water or if I wanted a refill on my coffee. I tried to get her attention, but she didn't come. I waited like 10 minutes. I just felt like she neglected our table because we only ordered the cheesecake.

It was HUGE.  Big enough for two people for sure, maybe three or four.  It's almost like the food here should be ordered ""family style.""  Then, we shared the margherita pizza, which was oddly kind of over cooked.

Our waiter was very nice and took great care of us. For an appetizer we ordered the stuffed mushrooms. It comes with six. They were very tasty! I got the Baja Chicken Tacos. They were fabulous! My husband got a chipotle chicken sandwich and was very pleased with his choice as well. Our 1 year old daughter got grilled chicken with mashed potatoes (SO delicious), and carrots.

178,Martin R.,"Diamond Bar, CA",341,31,6.0,3.0,2015-08-01,"In my opinion the cheesecake factory is far too overrated. Our waitress was a Ninja!! I say that because she would never be seen so you can actually tell her or ask for anything but as soon as you said you wanted something -- BOOM!! She was there within like two seconds asking if you wanted to thing you just said to yourself. She never really let you know that she was paying attention to you because she would just turn her back as you were asking for something! She did seem to have a very pleasant personality but what killed it was the fact that it seemed that she didn't pay any attention to you. Which is horrible customer service actually.. In her defense she did bring you what you wanted although she never actually spoke to you or said things like ""oh you're welcome"" or, ""OK cool! Coming right up!"" Not even acknowledge that you said something and she heard you. .. Her name was Wendy btw. With regards to the food, I got the shrimp and Diane steak which was good. However there was way too much garlic on the shrimp, which for a garlic lover, was far too overwhelming! The steak was pretty good albeit small pieces it too had strong pieces of garlic in it.. I did like the mushrooms however. One member of our party wanted lasagna and for an American establishment you would think that they would have this. However no, they did not. They had everything else except lasagna. It's kind of hard to understand why they would not have such a simple thing. Does it take too long to cook lasagna!? We were confused. The birthday treat that they gave our family member was a joke. Basically they have a little cup which they put Hershey's syrup on the bottom, then filled it with whip cream..  and put a candle on it. You would think that a place called ""the cheesecake factory"" could spare half a slice of cheesecake for your birthday.. but did they? No, they did not!  Instead they give you a little cup of whipped cream with sprinkles on it! LoL Overall they were nice & courteous, not rude at all. It just wasn't the best type of service that you would expect from a place like that. I must say I would not advise you NOT to try it for yourself. However I do say that I would not go in with any high expectations. The only reason I would ever return was if there was a company convention in Palm Springs and this was the place that they chose for an after event. Or if a birthday party was scheduled there.

My boyfriend needed a refill, and set his glass to the edge of the table to basically signal the waiter or any staff member to stop by. Never got refills or checked on. Even where I work, the servers help each other out and stop by tables if they see the guests need refills or something else. Had to ask another server for the check because at this point we just wanted to leave. The woman who cleared our table and got our check let the manager know we were unhappy. The manager, Tim, came by and was okay. We explained that this was not the first time we received crappy service.

I can't remember the last time I sent an entree back at a restaurant but I had to this time. The chicken tasted like it was a few days old. I sent it back and asked for something different. 10 minutes later the manager came by and literally said ""can you please tell me why you didn't like the dish because you ate most of it."" I almost fell out of my chair in shock of how rude she was. I had maybe 4 or 5 bites of the plate and sent it on its way. I told her that is wasn't good and that I would pay for the dish even though I barely had any. I don't need her charity. She was so rude that another manager overheard the conversation and was so embarrassed that he wanted to cover our entire bill. I said absolutely not and I paid for everything. I didn't want that terrible manager to get her way by thinking she can completely insult customers and cover her rear end by paying for our bill.

Brought it to the attention of the waitress and she asked us if we put all the pepper on it...nope we didn't. We asked for more sauce and it did taste better.  Of course by the time the sauce came the meal is cold.  Manager did come by table to make sure we liked the new sauce saying sorry.

So not a good start. Our server who I did see was busy with other customers took a while to get to us. We had ample time to figure out what to order. We ordered and then the server came back and asked if we wanted bread. Ofcourse we did. After another 10 minutes we finally got some water and our bread.  I ordered the Chicken BBQ pizza which was average..I always got this before but I feel it was better at the other locations I have been to. My friend ordered the lunch pasta. She said it was too oily didn't even eat half of it.  We didn't even stick around to order cheesecake. Oh well. Definitely wasn't a good visit to the cheesecake factory.

The food overall was good. I got a chicken plate with a really good lemon sauce. I subsisted the mashed potatoes for pasta which was excellent.

(Mon night) It was a half hour wait for a small table in the dining area so we just opted to eat at the bar once we got our drinks. It was later in the evening so it was relatively calm in the bar. The drinks were good but expensive. IE $12.25 for a small martini. My go-to dish - the garlic chicken farfalle was not the usual star dish I am used to. The chicken was not seasoned at all in the dish and there was not a lot of it. I paid $5 extra for 4 shrimp to be added to the dish. They were smaller than expected and way over cooked on the grill. Rubbery and a waste. So was the pasta, overcooked. Not a lot of sauce was on the plate like it normally would be and the ingredients in the dish were generally sparse. Hubby loved his chicken marsala however, and was able to sub pasta for mashed potatoes. This chicken was prepped quite differently (properly) and the mushrooms were delicious! We had such good service, we said nothing about my food. We politely declined the cheesecake offered for purchase at the end of every meal and finished our drink to leave. We only get to a beloved CF once a year or so. It was good but could have been a bit more special with some food/expediter quality control.

91,Charla M.,"Desert Hot Springs, CA",23,34,,2.0,2017-01-08,"Upon our arrival we noticed how beautiful the restaurant was. I have been to the Marina Del Rey, Canoga Park, Victoria Gardens, and The Grove locations and this one is the best looking one thus far. The wait wasn't very long but when our pager went off the young lady took our pager and said she would handle it, and she seated another family without letting us know what was going on. I went to the front desk to find out what was going on, and we were treated like what happened wasn't a big deal and treated as though we were stirring up trouble, and she said our menus were there and we would be seated.   When we were seated at the table the server gave us our water with NO straws. The server took our order and didn't check on us as much as she should have or anticipated our needs. She did not offer boxes for our food, she just watched it sit there, and finally she asked us if we needed her to box it up. The server did not bring enough napkins, and her attitude was so so. I asked the server for change and she brought back two 5's and ask could I wait for some 1's which took some time. Instead of the wait she could have just got change, it was for her tip. Despite what went happened, we still tipped her the 15%.  I feel it's all about the experience when you go to a restaurant, and we felt a little uncomfortable. The server was very bland even though she smiled. The other races that were being serviced by this server made them a priority, met their needs, and they even received straws with their drinks. I know there are probably not many African American patrons that come there but we shouldn't have to feel like it. I requested a manager and he was apologetic with a smirk on his face and it just didn't seem sincere. He said he would talk to the server. For the most part we felt that it was not an inclusive environment, it wasn't inviting, and it seemed like most of the staff treated us like we were out of our element or we we inconveniencing them in some way. Everyone that walks in that restaurant,  should be treated equally.  When individuals are in a customer service or service occupation they should be able to anticipate needs of their customers, make everyone feel welcomed, not assume that because they are a certain race that they are going to act a certain way, or assume what a persons reaction is going to be to something, and if the individuals do not have exposure to a certain culture, race, ethnicity, or sexual preference they should get educated.

Although I really like the large variety of options on the menu, the food never actually tastes as good as it looks in pictures. It's always either too much seasoning or not enough. I had a pasta dish and it was way too oily. I gave up trying to enjoy it not even half way through and picked at my husband's food instead. And even his food seemed a little on the bland side. Not going to call anyone out by name, but our waitress was particularly horrible. It took her forever to even come get us started with appetizers and then to get our main course order. She took much too long between checking up on us and even kept forgetting to bring the additional things we asked for, like a side of ranch for my fries and my friend's new drink order.

Mexican, Asian, Italian, American! They have it all!

This is actually an appetizer but he enjoyed it as his meal. Would be awesome to share with a few people. I ordered the Skinny-licious Asian chicken salad! Soooo huge, and full of fresh veggies and chicken!!! I will probably dream about that salad!  Of course we had to order cheesecake! So we got the Oreo one to finish!

We came to this location for my birthday yesterday with a party of 9 people. When I got to the host counter, I was not even greeted, the girl just stood there and starred at me. So I just said my name is Chris and there's 9 of us. I then asked for an approx wait time and she said there's no way of telling me and handed me the pager.  We waited for 45 mins until we decided to ask the host how much longer. She said the table were waiting for was just paying the bill. Another 20 mins goes by and she said that same table just ordered dessert. We waited a total oh 90 mins and must've watched at least 50 people walk out in large groups. We were still never called. I asked if we could sit out on the patio, but she said it's closed.  We decided to no longer waste any time and go elsewhere as it was getting very late and the host still could not tell us how much longer we could wait.  I came to this location last year and waited about 45 mins for a party of two. I totally get they're busy and there's no way of making reservations, but this particular location is the WORST when it comes to wait times. I will not be trying my luck here again. How can management allow an hour and a half or longer to be wait times?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rancho-mirage?start=20,3.6,3.5,3.448,2.8560000000000003,3.5400000000000005
143,Angie M.,"Cherry Valley, CA",0,2,2.0,1.0,2017-07-30,"This review is based on my visit on 07/30/2017. My family and I were told it was going to be an hour wait for a party of 8. We decided to wait it out. While we were waiting we noticed parties of 6 and 7 get were getting seated before us. Once the hour passed, I went up to the hostess and mentioned that it had been an hour and we still had not been seated. She told me that they were waiting for a large party to get up, and that large parties usually dine in for an hour and a half. She mentioned that the party had been dining in for 2 hours now, so the table should be available soon. I thought it was ridiculous that our chances of getting seated depended on this particular table. It's a huge restaurant, tables can be rearranged to accommodate their customers. But I kept my comments to myself. After waiting for 1.5 hours, I brought it up again to the hostess. The manager just happened to be standing right by her. He didn't even apologize for our wait. He simply used the same excuse the hostess had used. At this point my family and I were very frustrated, but we had waited too long to leave. After waiting for 1 hour and 45 minutes, I went up to the hostess a third time. I got the same excuse. This time I did bring it up to their attention and mentioned that we were never going to get seated if our chances of getting seated depended on this ONE table. We saw families that were there before us go in and out, meanwhile we were still waiting for a table. But both the hostess and the manager didn't seem to care. After waiting almost 2 hours we finally got seated. Our waiter was Maggie, she was AMAZING. We let her know we had waited 2 hours to get seated and we were all ready to order. She sincerely apologized, and proceeded to take our drink order along with our meal order. She provided 5 star service! But this review is about the customer service we received from the manager CHARLES. At the end of our visit I decided to head over to the Cheesecake counter because I wanted to see their options as opposed to looking at their menu. They were having a promotion and cheesecakes were 50% off. I purchased 2, and handed the cashier a $20 bill. When I got my receipt I noticed I only received a discount for 1 of those cheesecakes. The same manager from earlier happened to be standing there so I brought it up to his attention. He rudely told me it was one discount per person, which is understandable. But I said to him that I had 7 other people with me, so I wasn't abusing the promotion. I also said to him that I'm sure he remembered me from earlier because I had spoken to him about waiting 2 hours to get seated in his restaurant. He laughed and rolled his eyes, and behaved like a 13 year old teenage girl would. At this point I had enough, I asked if he could process a return for the cheesecakes. This so called ""manager"" didn't even know how to process a return. He struggled for a while, and finally made some other employee process it for him. First of all, he shouldn't manage a restaurant if he has no sense of customer service. And second, if a manager can't do something as simple as work the register he shouldn't be managing other employees. The company should look to hire within and actually employ someone with decent people skills.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rancho-mirage?start=140,3.48,3.47,3.432,2.724,3.474

Comp my beer off my ticket? 2) 40 minutes for sliders and some Thai chicken wraps in a rather empty bar. So the people sitting next to us who walked in after can get their burgers first, but you can't get appetizers out? 3) when the sliders do arrive one of them is missing a bun? Because your line can't check to see if it's correct right?  This was a pretty ridiculous experience.

The food eventually came as ordered and it was hot.  We enjoyed our meals... my birthday celebration continues... but then dessert time came around and we were stuffed.  So we opted to get two desserts ""to go"" and after mentioning to the bartender it was my birthday, both desserts were charged on our bill. I don't mind paying for dessert when I order it, but usually one is comped or other surprise and delight gets offered when it is a birthday. I was pretty disappointed with the experience. Also, we had been in a few months ago and one of our entrees was brought to another table so we got to watch each other eat while the other one sat and waited while they remade the entree.  Manager offered apology but nothing else, not even a dessert.  At this point I'm pretty much over this place.  Used to enjoy coming here.  You can see by the amount of check-ins we were frequent guests.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rancho-mirage,2.32,3.29,3.42,,2.9019999999999997

And no matter which Cheesecake location you go to it's pretty close to the same. I love the Crispy Chicken Costeletta or the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp.  And the Filet is really good.

We had not decided on our meal but Tamas kept his eye on us. As soon as we were ready, he was there.  In Europe, service is generally pretty stealth - and he was too.  I looked up from my Bang Bang and saw him watching his tables.  He came by a few times to check on us.
