Sara served us and pulled out all the stops to make our visit memorable, down to the warm damp napkins on a plate to follow some fingertip appetizers.  She even talked me into trying a new cheesecake, the Raspberry Lemon Tart Cheesecake, although I had been resolved to pass up dessert in exchange for a second glass of Chardonnay. We had a lovely time in the sun on a balmy January afternoon.  It is a great spot to relax and converse after shopping the Galleria.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville?start=400,3.72,3.68,3.68,3.572,3.6960000000000006
289,Lydia K.,"Rocklin, CA",441,417,164.0,3.0,2012-02-16,"Went for my sister's birthday with a party of five of us.  I called ahead for reservations.  They do not take reservations BUT THEY WILL (according to the girl on the phone) take phone ahead seating.  Well when we got there the host told me they don't do that either.  I was put off because on the phone she said they did and she took my name.  The host was gracious and said he would get me in soon and when they seated us about 10 minutes later he said they seated us sooner and sorry for the mis-information.  I was peeved but they did make an effort to make up for it.  Please don't give me mis-information in the future, it just doesn't sit well with me. THE FOOD:  I ordered the seared tuna salad for $16.95.  Considering the huge portions that the Cheesecake Factory is know for I was expecting a good amount of tuna for the price right?  Well I was very dissapointed with the 5 very thinly sliced pieces about 1x1 1/2 inches each.  Also, the picture online shows sesame crusted tuna, this only had a spicy seasoining that tasted just like Tony Chachere's which was too much.  The dressing was tasty and overall it was edible but dissapointing.  I would not order it again. My husband had the BBQ salmon with corn succotash and mashed potatoes for $15.95.  He loved it and it was a big portion.  I tasted the salmon and potatoes and both were great. The other three enjoyed their meals but I did not taste them. I didn't hear them saying they were particularly wowed by their meals and one said the food was overly salty... We had cheesecake for dessert and I remember the slices being larger in the past, especially for $6.95.  Not worth it. The service was excellent and timed pretty well. As we were leaving, on the way out the hostess said, and this is an exact quote:  ""Thanks for leaving... I mean coming in.""  LOL we laughed for a long time with that.  She laughed too and when we joked we wanted her name she covered her name tag the entire time!  It was sooooo funny.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville?start=280,3.76,3.66,3.66,3.2440000000000007,3.7

Cheesecake Factory definitely topped my expectations in terms of service, but just met my expectations of food (excluding the cheesecake, of course!).  Ambience is one you'd expect from an American food chain restaurant. Dimly lit on the inside with a mediocre sound level. Not quite formal, and not quite homey. Our server was very nice and friendly, so no complaints there.  A tip on their food - their avocado eggrolls appetizer is absolutely delicious! It is a must try on anyone's dinner menu. All other foods are so-so, nothing quite so memorable. Cheesecake is delicious as expected, but I'd have to warn that I'm a rather boring eater sometimes. I always go for the original cheesecake (or the strawberry topped one), so I wouldn't bet on my cheesecake experience as a reliable review.

We asked him nicely to get the manager which he did and we told the manager it was irritating and not hygienic and after he made excuses for it he apologized and bought us a free desert. Then two guys come with mops and water and proceeded to mop around our table with stinky water. I couldn't believe it and took it as direct insult from the manager. We never asked for a comp or anything, just not to be bothered while eating...they could have cleaned the area near us. We asked for the manager again and another one came and made the same excuses, didn't seem to care when we said we had mop handles in our faces.

We both ordered burgers and I ordered mine medium well as usual. Unfortunately, my burger was a little too pink for my liking. I let our waitress, Anna, know and she immediately took it to the back to get it replaced. Her manager, Chris, then came over and made it clear to apologize for the uncooked meat and to let me know that if there were any more problems, he would love to pay for our dessert. A few moments later, another manager, Slade, came over and also apologized saying that he wanted to make sure we were not upset. I got the burger back within minutes and it was PERFECT. Slade and Anna both came back to check on me and make sure I was satisfied. When we were ready to order our desserts, Anna let us know that they were completely covered and we couldn't have been more surprised!

Another couple arrived 10 mins after us (still no cheescake btw) ordered and within 2 mins they had their desserts and were gone......ok.....15 minutes later.....""excuse me how long does it take to get 2 slices?"" oh well, we're sorry but we're really busy right now and i'll need for you just wait till i can get someone to fill that order..... ok so now its 25 mins, no cheesecake and we're ready to go, i was furious i couldnt even be bothered to ask for my money back and we're running quite late for another appointment......as we're about to leave, a hostess walks up looking to change a large bill but this girl behind the counter says something and walks away.....my guy offers to change the large bill for her so she can proceed with her  night.......so no home support either.....congratulations! you have an ineffective team member and she's slowing you'r entire to-go section on a saturday night......a valentines weekend at that. 30 minutes by now and my guy just tells the young lady(if we dare call her that) to forget the order we're leaving and she bustles around irritated and gives us 2 containers with messy slices.  i said forget it!, we left the containers, took our money and just left. Im at loss to describe why that happened, what in goodness did we do to piss her off and why were we selectively picked on by this individual i will never know.

217,Joe K.,"Sacramento, CA",731,610,440.0,4.0,2013-02-26,"The Cheesecake Factory was my next stop on my quest for the best salad in Sacramento.  Believe it or not, my girl friend and I had never been to a Cheesecake Factory.  We both liked the large roomy interior which kind of reminded me of something you might see at Disneyland. We were promptly seated in a nice comfortable booth next to a window (I guess we just live right) where our waitress took our drink orders and gave us extensive menus that resembled children's books in both size and the thickness of the pages.  We were in no way intimidated by the size of these menus and immediately found our way to the lunch salad specials.  (It helps to be on a quest.) I think the waitress was quite surprised when she returned with our drinks and we already had decided on our orders.  We shared an avocado eggroll appetizer, Ida ordered a Carlton Salad and I ordered a Luau Salad.  The avocado eggroll was so damn good and I must admit that it set me up extremely well for the disappointment they called the Luau Salad. The chicken they use on their salads is a bit on the disgusting side.  It has kind of a boiled gelatinous texture and is completely void of any resemblance of flavor.  The rest of the salad was mostly lettuce with barely a touch of each of the vegetables they had mentioned on the menu.  The fried wontons were good and the dressing was good but they were not even close to being enough to save this boring mound of mediocrity.  I could barely even taste the meager distribution of sesame seeds that was my reason for ordering the Luau Salad in the first place. Now for the good part:  What do you do when you go to the Cheesecake Factory?  You eat Cheesecake.  I ordered a slice of White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake and Ida ordered a slice of Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake.  I am surprised they don't have the paramedics standing by.   You should have seen the size of those slices of cheesecake.  They were rather large and very rich and decadently topped with whipped cream.  I think I must have gained ten pounds before I even took a bite.  Oh; but it was a wonderful ten pounds indeed. My suggestion would be to order the avocado eggrolls and the cheesecake.  Skip the salad, it is a complete waste of calories. P.S.  Our waitress was wonderful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville?start=220,3.56,3.64,3.64,3.408,3.6080000000000005

Even though the Cheesecake Factory is a chain restaurant that some people might snub their noses at, I couldn't be more impressed at the visually appealing décor of Egyptian and Art Deco combinations of the interior!  It actually took my breath away, because this is my kind of taste!  I knew then and there that I was going to love this place no matter what!   The menus are extensive with food selections that would appeal to every appetite.  Even so, cheesecake was always in the back of my mind.  But we didn't want to feel too guilty by not eating something more substantial, so my boyfriend and I decided on eating some healthy salads first.  Our waitress Natalie was very nice and had a fun sense of humor as she guided us through the menu as first timers of this restaurant.  Our meals began with huge glasses of Diet Coke and ice tea with some hot, fresh breads and butter.  Then we ordered an appetizer of their popular Avocado egg rolls with an accompaniment of a sweet tasting dipping sauce.  Everything was perfect right from the start!   The main course: I ordered the Carlton Salad, while Joe K ordered the Luau Salad.  I couldn't believe the huge portions that were piled on our plates!  My salad was very good and had plenty of Romaine lettuce, grilled white meat chicken, feta cheese, avocado, dried cranberries, raisins, pears, oranges and pecans tossed in a vinaigrette dressing.  On the other hand, my boyfriend had the Luau Salad, but didn't seem as impressed with his, stating that it lacked some of the ingredients and flavor he was expecting this salad to contain.   Eventually, I had to stop eating salad or I wouldn't have room for dessert, so I got the rest to go.  The exciting finale arrived as we ordered the cheesecake!  I got the Caramel Pecan Turtle and bf got the White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut.  I didn't want to slice into these mouth-watering works of art, but forced myself anyway!  The combinations of chocolates, fudge, caramel, nuts and creamy cheesecake just can't be described in writing.  You'll just have to try it yourself!  Now I know why they named this restaurant after its heavenly desserts!  A great marketing tool that will draw in cheesecake lovers like me into becoming a continuous patron!                 My dreaded business mini trip to Rocklin, CA couldn't have turned out to be more of a successful and fun filled day that was highlighted by eating at the Cheesecake Factory!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville?start=160,3.6,3.64,3.64,3.54,3.6240000000000006

We were seated for 10 minutes before our server came and recognized our table telling us that he would be right back, 5 minutes later he returned to grab our drink order. 5 minutes later he returned with half of our drinks and bread which tipped over on his wet tray and then put on the table. When I told him that we would not accept the bread off of his tray he put up an argument informing me that the trays are sanitized after each use - I worked in food for 6 years, doesn't matter if your tray came right out of dishwasher - food should never touch it, he finally took the bread back. My brother ordered a sweetened green tea, it took 10 minutes longer for this drink to come out - I was able to have my water refilled by the time my brother got his ice tea, and my refill wasn't done by our server. So 30 minutes in we now have drinks, and our server continues to not be around, we manage to get him over to grab our dinner order and at the end he finally introduces himself as Micheal and takes off to the kitchen. During the 45 minutes our food was cooking Michael refilled a few of our drinks and got my brother another ice tea within 2 minutes of requesting it, why'd it take so long the first time??? Finally food came out - my brother gets shorted again- wrong order, my mother- missing sides. A manager, Mike, comes over and attempts to figure out what was wrong with the order, it is then that we informed Mike of the horrible service we had received, Michael overheard this and attempted to interject quickly being cut off by his manager and my brother. Manager Mike tried very hard to fix things, it wasn't happening though, by this point we were so frustrated with the lack of service we had received there was nothing he could do to make our dinner better.

Cheesecake factory has pretty much turned into my family's go-to pick for birthday lunches/dinners, casual family dinners, as well as a popular pick when I go on date nights with my sister.  I almost always start with an order of crispy fried cheese, which is mozzarella cheese that comes shaped as triangles with marinara sauce on the side. (I always ask for a side of ranch because who doesn't like fried cheese dipped in ranch?) The BBQ chicken salad at Cheesecake is delicious: romaine lettuce with veggies, chicken, bbq ranch dressing topped with onion straws. When I come to Cheesecake Factory I normally come with the predetermined idea that I going to indulge, so with my salad, I ruin any chance of healthiness by order a side of french fries. The french fries that they serve are some of the greatest fries that I have ever had. How do they get them that perfectly golden and crispy? Now if I am at Cheesecake for a birthday party or some other form of a celebratory event I go for the lemon raspberry cheesecake. There is NO other cheesecake that compares.

The zucchini was delicious but the deep fried avocado was a miss as far as we are concerned. $6.50 sausage flat bread pizza, this seemed smaller and more expensive, but still tasty, probably not worth $6.50 any longer though. $3.50-$4 or so Strawberry Lemonade: this was crazy good, not to sweet not to tart with free refills a huge hit.

If I was comparing it to local restaurants, then I would stay away. Food- 2.5/5. For the money you get HUGE portions. Please take half of it home! Or don't eat anything else for three days. Your choice. I honestly can't really find anything here that I particularly like with the exception of two things. The cheesecake is really good and they have a ton of flavors so it kind of doesn't even taste like cheesecake sometimes which is good. Cause I don't really like cheesecake. The other thing is the ranch dressing. Yes, that's right, they have the best ranch dressing I have ever tested. Hard to believe right? I still have not found anything to compare. Other than those two things, everything else is eh. The Grilled Cheese is edible, salads are OK, nachos are fine, the garlic noodles are gross, and well, that's about all the vegetarian options. My Husband loves their Shepherds Pie which he gets every time we come here. Either it is that good, or he likes nothing else.  Atmosphere- 5/5. The restaurants are always so beautiful. Nicely painted, interesting light fixtures, comfy booths, etc. great for a night or with the family or date. Service- 4/5. I don't think I've ever had bad service here. There always seems to be enough people working and they are attentive.  Vegetarian Friendliness- 2/5. As mentioned above, there are only a few things on a menu with 30 pages for vegetarians. Kind of disappointing! And they are just the basics too, grilled cheese, salad, nachos, etc. You would think they would have more inventive dishes considering the menu. Overall- 2.5/5. If I had a choice between The Cheesecake Factory and another chain restaurant, I may pick The Cheesecake Factory. Or not. If I had a choice between The Cheesecake Factory and pretty much any local restaurant in town, I would eat local and save 3000 calories while doing it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville?start=220,3.96,3.8,3.8,3.468,3.864

545,Michelle B.,"Fair Oaks, CA",117,197,58.0,5.0,2014-01-27,"I started coming to this Cheesecake Factory location a few weeks ago. I've been here several times now and every time the service is absolutely wonderful, especially Heidi, and the serving sizes are plentiful. Plus, I feel the entrees are fairly priced. Depending on the mood I am in, going healthy or cheating on the diet, there's something for just about everyone. 1st visit I had the Beets & Goat Cheese Salad, it was surprisingly plentiful and filling. If you're also getting an entree, I recommend sharing the salad. I recommend asking for extra apples.  However! When I mentioned it to the server that they should up the apple quantity in the salad, she actually called the manager over, so I could share my comments with the manager (made my opinion feel really valued). I spoke with Ron, wonderful guy, and he absolutely agreed. In fact, Ron said he asks for extra apples on his own salads too. So, it is possible that they may, in fact, have already started serving it with additional apples!!! 2nd visit, I ordered the Buffalo Hamburger, but I ordered it protein style (with a lettuce wrap). When it came out, it barely had any buffalo hot sauce or blue cheese crumbles. I let the server know and she said originally the kitchen had goofed and they made it on a regular bun, hence my condiments were probably stuck to the bun. She quickly sent out a hearty bowl of extra buffalo sauce and blue cheese crumbles and the manager Ron delivered them. Again the manager was genuinely interested in my feedback and getting to the bottom of the issue regarding the lacking condiments. The burger was perfectly cooked, how I requested (medium-rare), and very good!  3rd visit, we had a big group and we were looking for appetizers and dessert. We ordered the Chicken Nachos which were HUGE. We had 4 kids and 2 adults and there were still some nachos left over. We also ordered the calamari, it was very good. Not the best I've ever had, but good. As well as we ordered the deep dried Macaroni Balls, these were a great hit with the kids. For dessert, we split 3 cheesecakes among 6 people. Smores', Dulce (caramel), and New York Plain Cheesecake. They were all equally wonderful, but how can you go wrong with cheesecake?!? Beverages: their hot chocolate is incredible!

We ordered: Buffalo Blasters (appetizer) - these are little fried wontons full of shredded chicken, cheese, and buffalo sauce. They are honestly one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten, and the boyfriend and I crave these things daily now! Fried Zucchini (appetizer) - these were for me since my boyfriend doesn't eat vegetables. I'm a huge fan of fried zucchini, and these were the best I've tried so far.  Fettuccine Alfredo (meal) - probably not the best fettuccine alfredo I've ever had but it was still pretty good. Crusted Chicken Romano (meal) - this is basically like chicken parmigiana. Breaded chicken breasts over tomato cream sauce and noodles. It was pretty good as well. Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake (dessert) - couldn't have asked for a better tasting birthday ""cake"". I love love LOVE pineapple upside down cake so this was perfect for me.  Honestly, this place has a great atmosphere, great service, and delicious food.

Since they don't accept reservations or call ahead seating, we arrived a half an hour early to wait for a table for nine of us. As expected, the place was packed! But then again, this place is always packed. But, we were able to get a table in about forty minutes, not bad considering it's Mother's Day weekend.  While we waited for others to arrive, we waited at a table in the bar. Adam, our server was very friendly and knowledgeable. While hubs ordered his usual adult beverage, Long Island, I wanted something different, Adam knew that I was indecisive, he gave me some suggestions, and when I decided on one he didn't recommend, he suggests the Passion Fruit Margarita. When my drink arrived, it was delicious! Something new, out of my norm, nice change!  When the rest of our party arrived, we were seated in the patio area, at first I was reluctant, it was a windy day but it was very tolerable, since the table was closest to the building. Madison, was our server for the dining area and she was phenomenal. She was very professional, expedient, and attentive.  It took our party a lengthy amount of time deciding what to eat, especially me. There's over twenty pages in their menu with a variety of entrees, salads, apps, sandwiches, burgers, and desserts. I like that there's a bit of almost every internationally inspired dish here. There's Chinese, Italian, Mexican, Greek, Japanese, and American. With so many choices, it was super difficult to make a decision. On this visit, we had Moroccan chicken, bistro shrimp, meatloaf, fish n' chips, lemon chicken, miso glazed salmon, french dip, teriyaki chicken and flat bread pizza. Everything was delicious. I tasted my brother's Moroccan chicken on a bed of cous cous, it was really good. I had to sample the ever popular miso glazed salmon and that was phenomenal! The salmon was grilled to perfection with a crusty outer exterior. Seasoned to perfection. I think I'll be ordering that on my next visit. The teriyaki chicken was yummy as well, I had asked my daughter if she was sure about her choice because she is very finicky about her teriyaki chicken. She had it before,  therefore she was adamant in her choice. She made an excellent choice, loved the presentation including grilled plantains.

Our waiter was great and our food arrived in a relatively decent amount of time. We always order the avocado rolls as an appetizer. I also like the beet and goat cheese salad. We used to order the vegetarian pizza with goat cheese, but since they've removed that off their menu, I'm yet to find an entree that I LOVE. I ordered the ""Incredible Eggplant Sandwich"" and unfortunately it didn't quite live up to its name for me. After our meal, I received a survey code, after which you get a $10 eCard. I did the survey while my son wandered in the kids' area at the mall, and to my excitement, the code arrived shortly after so we headed back to the restaurant for a slice of cheesecake to go. This is when things went a little sour for me. Now I understand that they are called the CHEESECAKE factory and naturally their dessert section would be pretty busy, however, I stood at the counter and made contact with MULTIPLE employees, none of which even ACKNOWLEDGED me!! After a few minutes of waiting, I finally blurted out ""This is where I stand to make an order, right??"" after which they responded they would be right with me. I ordered ONE slice of cheesecake that was readily available in the counter and then had to wait for over TEN minutes for them to get it ready!!! What the heck! When they finally did prepare it for me, it literally took less than a minute. WHY DID IT TAKE SO LONG FOR THEM TO GET IT FOR ME??? I was tempted to just go back there and get it myself! I'm a relatively patient person, but it just irked me that they would leave me standing there (with no other customers waiting at the physical counter) wait for over ten minutes for something that takes less than a minute.

I used to love going to this chain restaurant that is loved by pretty much everyone and it is a disappointment I have to write a negative review.  We went around 9pm and it wasn't busy at all. We were seated quickly but after that it was horrible, slow service. Our waitress took forever to take our drink and appetizer order!  We got our appetizer- the Crab Wontons- which were actually delicious and ate them. It took us about 20 minutes to eat them and we realized the waitress still hasn't came by to take our order even though she walked by countless times. It was an additional 15 minutes before my fiancé had to flag her down. He ordered the classic hamburger and I ordered a Caesar salad with added grilled shrimp. It came out in a timely matter- but the food was nasty. My shrimp was dry and there was hardly any dressing on the salad. The dressing was also bland and I had to send my salad back because I could not eat it. The waitress then became very rude and had attitude. My fiancé also didn't finish his food- his hamburger was dry and tasteless. I was surprised how a chef could ruin a simple salad and hamburger. I am not sure this horrible service and food was because it was late and the employees were not having it- but I will never go here again.

However, it was Yummy...this was a very simple dish with great flavor, if you like it sweet. But then, who doesn't like it sweet  you get your choice of white or brown rice, I chose brown. They laid the Miso salmon over the bed of rice, then laid snow peas around the bed of rice.Next time I will ask for more snow peas, or maybe a side of veggies, because they only give you about 6 snow peas total. Finally, they topped it off with a tasty white wine cream sauce, yum, I'm almost ready for some more. We couldn't shut it down with out the cheesecake! Because we were stuffed, we decided to share a slice of the red velvet cheesecake.

First - the service is not the fastest.  If you know what you want when you order your drinks, I recommend you do it - otherwise you won't get it for a while. It isn't  a terrible wait - but I believe this place is under staffed.  Once you order your food, service seems a bit normal. Second - if you have kids, get the ""kids plate""... I didn't even realize they had this, but the hostess asked me if we wanted it.  All it is is 4 pieces of bread and some banana slices.  This makes this place worth the money alone! You know how many restaurants I go to just hoping my kid doesn't freak out while in his high-chair.  The kids plate will keep him entertained until you get your food )my kid is 18 months, BTW). Lastly - a food review. Typically I order the skinnylicious soft tacos... which are basically 3 tacos which are really, really good.  If you order their normal size plate, it is inly 3 dollars more and you get FOUR tacos and rice/beans.

This wasn't a big deal as we decided to go early and put our names down in case in was busy...It was of course but we had a lot of time to kill. It was a nice plus to see that instead of waiting with the masses inside the restaurant they give you the options of text messages while you walk the mall. The final wait Til was over an hour and half, no surprise there, but by that time we were just happy to get a table. Our waitress was surprise nice and super quick, got our bread and drinks out almost instantly.

The only one to not like his dinner was my gf's brother, however he is super duper picky and I knew once he ordered it he wouldn't like it..oh wells On to dessert, you can't go to Cheesecake Factory and not get a cheese cake or two. We ordered two, the pineapple upside down cake and white chocolate raspberry. I can't complain about either, both were delicious and a great ending to the meal.

It's been continuously getting worse. Less drink refills, less checking on how we're doing... The last time I came, I was waiting for my BF. I was seated and forgotten until he arrived 40 minutes later. I knew he'd be late, but I expected to be checked on by staff. No bread. No asking if I wanted to order anything while I waited. The waitress brought me water and never returned. Even after he arrived, she only checked on us once. No drink refills. Just felt pushed out.  2) Food portions: my favorite dish is the Lemon herb chicken dish. Still is. But the portions were half what they normally are! I've noticed it getting smaller, but this was ridiculous. One time, while big and pregnant, they brought this dish and the chicken was raw!!! I had to send it back, which I very rarely do.

It was an hour and 10 minutes. Meanwhile almost all other parties were seated before us. I complained twice. By the third time, we were ALL pretty perturbed. They finally sat us, where we sat for over an hour before we got our meals. The trouble goes on and on. I had to go to the social station (oh, I mean the server station) to tell someone to send the manager over, but that was a joke. Nothing changed except that 4 servers brought our meals. After that, we went back on ignore. I can't stress how aggravating that was. With that many people extremely unhappy and very hungry before they even get seated, get out of social mode and GET TO WORK!

When my plate was delivered, there were multiple bugs (very small) crawling all over the lettuce that was served with my meal. I immediately had the waitress return the plate to the kitchen, and did not order an additional lunch plate. As someone who is ServSafe and HACCP certified, this is incredibly alarming and a clear indication that this establishment is not following proper procedures and protocol for their food preparation.  The waitress had the manager come and apologize for the ""inconvenience"". The manager did not seem genuinely apologetic for the incident, and did not make an effort to rectify the situation. Generally, restaurants with excellent customer service would offer some form of incentive to return to the establishment after an experience like this, but the manager did not.

It is NOT bad, but I never find myself craving it either. When reminded of the prices after a recent visit, I'm just not impressed. Our service was less than average. It wasn't bad, but it was the kind of service that makes you irritated that tipping 18% is customary in our country. For an addition 18% on top of already overpriced food, I would like impressive service. Unfortunately I didn't find that here. Our waiter was busy, I'll give him that, but more specifically I felt he was distracted. We didn't get ignored and service wasn't bad, it simply wasn't anything beyond sufficient.

The dishes are overly greasy and buttery. The flavors are usually overkill with sauces that are too heavy or creamy or tangy or whatever. There's no fusion of flavor, there's just one overpowering element in any dish you order that kills it.  The cheesecake is exceptional, but at $7 a slice, I don't think I can stomach it.

Line can be long at time especially on a weekend so wait times might be high. They have lots of seating inside and some seating outside.

514,Lily D.,"Roseville, CA",78,451,1213.0,2.0,2015-07-30,Food good but service is not and where the low stars come from. I have only been to this location once about 5 years ago.  Its just a not a place I think about going.  I had been with friends but my husband had not so we agreed to go.  It is a little smaller than the one on Arden.  We walk in for late lunch around 230 on Wednesday.  Little did know it was cheesecake day and all slices were half off as I saw on the flyer at the counter.  Not ONE employee ever told me about it.   We had walked in with another group and the hostess was a little confused who to help so I politely tell her that they were first so she takes them to her seat and we view the dessert case trying to make our cheesecake selection in the meantime.  I turn around and she is helping/seating the new people who just walked in.  Hello???  Our server came and got our initial drink and food order in a good amount of time but went down hill from there.  I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken as I remembered really liking it.  Husband got avocado rolls which for a meal left me unsatisfied but was actually tasty.  My dish was not as good as a I remembered.  Noodles were a little too al dente and not as flavorful?   Waitress was inattentive. Checked on us once about 3 minutes after our food delivered and I had not taken a bite yet. Then nothing.  Our drinks were bone dry and we were about to get up and get refills ourselves at the drink station that was so teasingly close to our table when she finally came.  I told her we both made sure to leave room for dessert!  so she asked if we'd like a dessert menu.  Yes please!  Their desserts are very expensive.  EVERYTHING is $7 minimum.  They wanted $6.95 for a bowl of fresh strawberries.  Are you kidding me??? and $7.95 for a hot fudge sundae.  A cheese cake slice is $7-8 in which I can accept but still so pricey if you figure on a table of 6 would add another $42 to the bill.  Thank goodness for being half off day.  We decided what we wanted and waited.  And waited.  And waited 10+ minutes before she came by to take our dessert order.  The wait was so long that it didn't sound good anymore and the wait was not worth it as we had things to do.   As for the survey for your $10 egift card.  Be wary.  It asks for your name/address/phone/email and not a whole lot about your visit.  Two questions exactly.  Seems like a phishing expedition on their part even though there is a whole one page disclaimer but I think that is why they do it. I have never seen such a long in depth disclaimer in my life for a survey!  Overall I was very disappointed in this visit.  Service was terrible.  Food was not outstanding.  I couldn't even try their infamous cheesecake.  Looks like another 5 years before I return to this location.  There are just too many good places to eat in Roseville now to want to come back.  Plus I am not a huge cheesecake fan.  I like it but don't love it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville?start=120,3.6,3.38,3.576,3.2720000000000002,3.4680000000000004

The server we had last time was super sweet and attentive and I wish I could remember her name because she was awesome. Tonight, not so much.  Our server was friendly and was able to answer a couple questions about the menu, but we barely saw her the whole meal. When she was actually at our table, she was always in a hurry to run off and forgot anything she didn't write down. Waited ten minutes to order drinks, waited another ten to actually get them and when she dropped them off she put them all on the edge of the table and ran off before we could say a word. That's not a huge deal but really? Food took longer than usual and we weren't able to get more bread/refills because she didn't come back until some of the food was out, and learned only then that one of the entrees was missing. Asked for bread again, and again, and finally got it as we were leaving. I get it, it's a Saturday night and it's busy, but honestly tonight's service just felt lazy and the lack of it turned what should have been a 45 minute dinner into at least an hour and a half.

Their cheesecake wasn't too bad either, but for $8 a slice, I could have gotten an entire cheesecake at Safeway that tasted better.  The atmosphere was like a badly decorated Vegas casino- and just as loud! No offense, if that's your style. It's not mine.  We ordered several things to try just because the menu was so huge there must be something this place excels at, right? Wrong. The food is WAY overpriced for the mediocre crap you get. The broccoli was not even steamed correctly. It was like crudités that sat in the back of the fridge for a couple weeks until they were kind of limp, then warmed briefly before being served as ""steamed veggies"". The pasta was ""eh"", the potatoes sucked, and the appetizers were gross. You know how Chef Ramsay always says pick a limited menu and excel at that, because you can't be good at a bunch of random items? He was right. I wish he would do a Kitchen Nightmares episode at The Cheesecake Factory. I can't believe people actually enjoy eating here. I can't believe this place is still in business. I'll never go back unless I hear that they have refined the choices on the menu and really put quality first.

Very disappointing. On the bright side, the sauces that came with them were wonderful.  For our entrees, three of us ordered the Steak Diane (all medium rare). One came out medium rare, the other two were medium well. All were horribly under seasoned.  About 10 minutes after we ordered we were informed that there was a shortage of mashed potatoes and were asked if there was a side dish that they could substitute for the mashed. I said that I wanted the mashed and didn't want a substitution. Another five minutes goes by and the waiter comes to our table to inform us that they now have found some mashed potatoes and all was right with the world, that is until I tried them and found that they had large chunks of uncooked potatoes in them (argh!).  The other person in our party ordered a burger and fries which wasn't too bad except for the fries which are large fresh cut fries much like In & Out Burger serves just a bit thicker.  And just like In & Out fries they are great when they are hot, but five minutes later when they cool off a bit, they become incredibly nasty.

I came in for Lunch, and usually I prefer lunch service than dinner service.  It's always busy, crowded no matter what day or time you come here ...  and on their Menu you can order anything at anytime!  I love the Ahi Tartare appetizer, it's very tasty, pretty presentation, and nice flavors of the soy sauce with Avocado, ginger, Ahi tuna.  I tend to always order the same thing to eat, either the Steak Diane or Chicken Madeira.  Those are definitely my top 3 favorite choices.  Haven't tried many other items on their menu yet, but I did have Brunch at Sacramento Arden, which they do have an awesome Sunday Brunch menu. As for cheesecakes, I usually try to order a different one each time I go there and haven't been disappointed yet.  I tried the Pumpkin one last year, so I know that is great!  Salted Caramel was OK.  So far my most favorites are the Tuxedo and Red Velvet, but want to try so many more!!!!  Yesterday was actually the first time I ever ordered Cheesecake a la mode.  I guess I was expecting only one scoop of ice cream, but it came with two scoops of Vanilla ice cream.  Definitely could not finish it :(  I really enjoyed the Red Velvet cheesecake with the ice cream, it was perfectly delicious together.  You can also purchase whole cheesecakes, they are kind of expensive.  I am thinking about ordering a whole one for Christmas this year, if my family can make a decision on what flavor to pick!  They have so many cheesecake flavors, it's a long list... Lunch was great as always.  I highly recommend the Steak Diane, though on menu I thought it said $17.95, and my receipt was $19.95, so prices may have increased recently.  Hostess was Welcoming and I have a preference where I like to sit, which she gladly accommodated me.  My server was friendly, attentive, polite.  She did a great job and was helpful to kindly box up the leftovers.  The inside of the restaurant, design and colors are quite beautiful.  Hopefully will be back around December and Christmas shopping, definitely want a slice of Peppermint bark cheesecake too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville?start=60,3.84,3.54,3.584,3.248,3.66

If you have false or loose teeth, I wouldn't recommend it. It took a lot of effort to bite into it. They also don't put cheese on a turkey sandwich, which was weird. The turkey was also dry. The salad was soggy, but the dressing (Chinese Plum) was pretty good. I will say, the stuffed mushroom appetizers are great. But I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone.

130,Jeanice S.,"Sacramento, CA",269,271,424.0,3.0,2016-01-02,"Food: I love their ribeye steak here. They are the only ones I've found that serve it on a place with some kind of juice that helps the meat stay juicy. Although, the steak does not stay warm throughout the whole time you're eating it, or maybe I'm just a slow eater, but there are some places that cook the steak with the plate so well that every bite of the steak is warm. I do like their pastas, but they got rid of the sun-dried tomatoes pasta, which was THE best pasta they had on their menu. I've tried a few of their pastas, and they're good but nothing out of the ordinary. Their french fries are crunchy and golden. They always serve two huge onion rings with the steaks, and it's OK. They side vegetables are plain. I ordered the string beans and broccoli once and they could have been cooked a little longer. Their PASSION FRUIT MOJITO is delicious! It has the right amount of everything in there. My boyfriend likes this location's food more than the Elk Grove location. Service: Sometimes we get a waiter that is great, sometimes we get a waiter that just isn't that happy. I don't come to this location much but the waiters seem not as cheerful as the ones in Elk Grove.  Price: The price is kind of expensive but then you do get a large amount.

I would give the place 5 stars if it wasn't so freaking expensive! My go to dish - and no judgement - is the Mexican Tortilla Salad - but with the wasabi vinaigrette on the side. I know - what a weird mix of flavors but i love the ingredients in the Mexican Tortilla and the flavors in the wasabi vinaigrette. They got rid of the wasabi vinaigrette for a while but I'm glad i asked for it because it's back! i don't think they sell it up front for take home - but honestly - even if they did who can finish a huge jar in 5-7 days unless they are having a party right? This salad runs like $13.99 or $14.99 - a bit pricey for let's be honest - a salad. I do love how they have the variety of bread and butter for the table - that's a highlight since there's usually 2-3 kinds of bread :) yum.

There was a case of stuffed animals with the names of some of their cheesecake on them... they were cute. It was elegant and the designs on the wall were intriguing. It was like walking into an art gallery with designs everywhere... When our buzzer lit up, they sat us toward the right side of the restaurant. It was a very cozy table. After a few minutes, we ordered an appetizer-the zucchini sticks and a bacon burger to split. It came with 2 kinds of bacon-thick candied bacon and crispy bacon. Sounded great! We asked that they not put on the ""secret sauce."" Our waitress was very attentive, very nice.  She brought us bread and butter and a few minutes later, we got our zucchini sticks. The zucchini sticks were great, but the ranch tasted sour. So next time, I'm bringing my own ranch, lol! We finish all of our zucchini sticks by the time the burger made it out. We had received an extra plate so that we can split it ourselves. As we checked out the amazing looking burger....AND found that damn secret sauce on it! So we told the waitress, and a manager made her way out to let us know they were working on another one. We sat about 10 minutes waiting for our remake. When it came out, a manager delivered it. :-) We check for the no sauce on the burger, cut the thing in half. ... 2 bites in, I thought I had hair in my mouth....but couldn't really find it unless I wanted to split my food out and inspect it. Plus, I only thought. When I looked back at my plate, sure enough, there was a dark hair on my plate. Trying to convince myself it was mine, I tried to pick it...but it had been intertwined in my burger. It was thin, about 4 or 5 inches long and absolutely not mine. My husband watched as I wrapped it around my hand to pull it out of my burger.  Disgusting!  We stopped eating, they apologized and asked if we wanted anything else.  Not really. I THINK I HAD PART OF THAT HAIR IN MY MOUTH! They did offer us a slice of cheesecake, which we took home. It was the salted caramel.

I have visited their location in Arden Arcade a handful of times for work meetings and I have always had a decent experience. TCF is a odd duck to me, the restaurants are quite beautifully adorned but the patrons are generally casually dressed. The food is typical chain restaurant ""menu for every taste"" yet is expensive for what you get. The menu touts fresh proteins and local sourced produce when available, which is not common to chain restaurants. Fresh food is commendable but when your menu is exactly 714 pages long execution can become a problem. I ordered the ""Roadside Sliders"". Noted hamburger aficionado George Motz wrote an article recently touting the Roadside Sliders as one of the better examples you can get. I don't disagree with his assessment as all the ingredients are there: white squishy bun, fresh beef, onion and pickle (and for some reason ketchup, I held the ketchup). The problem lies with the aforementioned 714 page menu. How can you cook everything properly when you have so much to do? The answer in my entree was you can't. The beef was overcooked, the onions were beyond charred and I had to steal some of the daughter's ketchup (shame!!!) to tackle the dryness. That being said the server was given back a clean plate. I couldn't leave without a slice of cheesecake. I ordered the ""Original"". Tremendously delicious!! Graham Cracker Crust, creamy sour cream filling and whip cream to round it out.

I arrived with a party of four during lunch rush and waited 20 minutes in an overcrowded waiting area to be seated. We were seated awkwardly in the middle of two other parties. we ended up being here for three hours simply because our server Austin neglected us the entire time and took exceedingly long to bring us our food. My friend ordered the mushroom burger without the beef because she is a vegetarian and he said ok got it! Next thing you know he brings a burger with beef in it, after everyone around us who ordered after us already got there food, and we had to send it back. When we tried to get our check so we could leave he completely ignored us and did not even ask if we wanted desert. We had to tell him ourselves. The couple next to us even noticed how poorly he was treating us and said that we were doing the right thing being nice because maybe he is just having a bad day. If that's the case maybe he should choose a different profession? Also, The garlic noodles were the worst I ever had! My friend couldn't even eat any of the cheesecake because they all contained gelatin! And the last time we were here our server told us some cheesecakes did not contain gelatin?!

We received a generous gift card from a family member last year so we've been going to this Cheesecake Factory off and on to use up the balance. The menu is HUGE and takes a while to read through.  Since my husband just had oral surgery, we needed super soft foods so we figured soup and cheesecake might be the way to go.   Got a clam chowder bowl to share (which was a HUGE bowl!!).  It had a lot of big pieces of clam.  Pretty good.  Maybe a little on the saltier side but maybe that's why they give you bread. Husband got the California omelette, which didn't come with any additional protein so he opted to add chicken.  We also substituted the breakfast potatoes for mashed potatoes instead (since those would be easier for him to eat without chewing too much).  We didn't know this till the end but that ends up being a pretty pricey omelette at $13.50 plus $3.50 = $17.  Glad we had the gift card! I got a Cobb salad with honey mustard on the side.  It was great!   We got a bunch of desserts to-go to use up the gift card:  red velvet cheesecake, lemon raspberry cheesecake (recommended by our server), Godiva cheesecake and the chocolate layer cake (not sure the exact name).  The two chocolate desserts are amazing.  The other two, not sure we'd get again.  They were just ok. Servers were great, food was good.  Only downsides are the prices can be high (our entire meal cost us around $90, including tip!), AND they are super busy on Friday evenings and weekends.  Our wait on a Friday evening was about 20 min, which wasn't too bad but as we were leaving around 7:30pm, the place was packed with people waiting.  This location seems considerably smaller than the Arden one. I'd come back again if we got another gift card, and I'd try to come at off-peak hours to avoid the crowds.  :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville?start=40,3.52,3.64,3.536,3.536,3.5920000000000005

66,FoodLover C.,"Carmichael, CA",0,14,18.0,3.0,2016-12-14,This review is based on our food that we ordered. I had the hibachi steak and my girlfriend had the da vinci pasta. We also ordered the deep fried zucchini and avocado. Too much salt in our zucchini. We tried the fried mac n cheese and it was good. My steak was done medium rare. I didnt eat my mashed potato because i dont like mashed potato and I forgot to switch it with other sides. Deep fried asparagus is good. The hibachi steak is like steak topped with terriyaki sauce imo which is not a good combination. The outcome of my steak was a little bit sweet. I was expecting to taste at least a little of the wasabi.  The da vinci penne pasta of my girlfriend is somewhat okay but I'd recommend you to get a different pasta. It is lacking of taste and a kick. There was chicken and mushrooms but i feel like it is lacking of taste. I feel like I'd like to boil my pasta with salt and after sautéing my chicken and mushroom I'd simmer it with chicken broth and mix the penne pasta in it. Service is okay.

However, last night I was feeling brave and ordered something different....the mac & cheese burger.  Oh em gee!! It was so amazing & perfect & cheesy & delicious! Basically, it's a chargrilled burger on a grilled roll topped with a deep fried patty of fried mac & cheese and then sliced cheese on top of that.  It is served with shredded lettuce, tomato, pickle, & onion on the side. This burger has got to be the best burger I have ever eaten. I always make sure to order a slice of cheesecake to eat when I get home. CF is one of those places that will satisfy just about anyone's craving. Don't forget to eat the brown bread!! It's to die for! The only negatives are: Limited seating in the lobby area The restaurant is LOUD The restaurant is pretty dark.  The lobby gets to be really crowded & it makes it difficult for the servers to pick up Cheesecake from the cheesecake counter.  Other than that, CF is great!

I only hate half of what was on my plate, and also saved an entire serving of black beans untouched specifically to take home with me. When I asked our server for a box so that I could take everything on my plate home, he insisted to box my food for me, so I said okay. I was disappointed today to see that only half of my food was actually boxed, and the entire bowl of beans that was on my plate was nowhere to be seen.

35,Donovan H.,"Citrus Heights, CA",298,320,1322.0,4.0,2017-01-16,"For those of you that have not dined at ""The Cheesecake Factory"", I must warn you that their menu book is about the size of a bible. And trying to find the perfect appetizer, entree, drink, and dessert can be way more of a tedious process than you might expect. To put it simple, they more or less have everything you're looking for; salads, sandwiches, burgers, seafood, chicken, steak, pizza, pasta, soup, breakfast food (during AM hours), well you get the picture. The location that I am focusing on is in Roseville and is more or less part of the Galleria shopping mall. Do keep in mind that parking here can be extremely difficult since the parking lot is shared with the mall shoppers. And it can get even more crowded if you plan on dining during dinner hours, weekends, and over the holiday shopping season. My lovely lady and I were very fortunate to grab a parking spot that was very close to the front entrance. And this just happened to have been on a Sunday afternoon around 5:00pm. The inside can describe several words; elaborate, gaudy, extravagant, and posh. It almost reminds me of being at a casino with the high ceilings, gold trim, and Tuscan artwork throughout. This particular location has a generous bar area, large tables for 10+ guests, and booths for smaller parties and couples. When my lady and I came, we put our names on a waiting list, told it would only take 15-20 minutes and received a buzzer. And they were good on their word as the buzzer did indeed go off in about 15 minutes. What makes the waiting part difficult is that there is no real sitting area except for a few small benches. Once we were seated, we were given menus and only a few minutes later, iced water with lemon wedges. Luckily we both knew what we wanted which helped simplify the whole process. I went with their ""Herb Crusted Filet of Salmon"" complete with a side of mashed potatoes and asparagus. She ordered their ""Steak Diane"" which also includes mashed potatoes as well as sauteed mushrooms and grilled onions. As for drinks, I went with a 22 oz. of their Racer 5 IPA while she had their Red Sangria. Our server was very friendly, had a good sense of humor, and made us feel right at home from the time we were seated until the time we left. And as busy as this place was, our food came out within only 15 minutes. Keep in mind, there must've been at least 200 guests dining here when we ate here so I am guessing they have a huge kitchen with at least 3 dozen chefs/cooks. As for our food, everything tasted good as what we had expected. My salmon had a nice seasoned flavor while the lemon sauce was a great addition. Her steak was seasoned very well as each medallion was tender yet there was quite an abundance of mushrooms on her plate.  Since we were both very full (this place is notorious for serving their guests hearty portions), we decided on ordering a slice of their cheesecake to-go. We both agreed on their ""Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake"". This included glazed strawberries with a few whipped cream puffs in our to-go box. When eating it at home, I do have to say that their cheesecake is one of the best I've tried and it's what they're known for, not to mention worth the extra calories. Overall, ""The Cheesecake Factory"" is and always will be a restaurant that has a little something for everyone. I do advice researching what you'd like to eat prior to coming in here to simplify the entire process. In the past, I have had many different food items and the quality of their food competes with restaurants such as ""BJ's Brewery"", ""Yard House"", and ""Outback Steakhouse"". Prices are competitive and if you're looking to save a few bucks, they do offer an excellent Happy Hour menu. Not to mention, a Sunday brunch for the weekend warriors. My rating for the Roseville ""Cheesecake Factory"", a respectable 4-stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville,3.52,3.62,3.484,3.184,3.5800000000000005

But the restaurant itself deserves zero stars, but it received one since that's not a possibility.  We arrived at 4:50 on a Saturday night, expecting some sort of wait since it was a Saturday and Saturdays are typically busy nights and the Cheesecake Factory is always busy. We were told 40 minutes and we're seated by 5:30, so no issues there. We were then told that new menu additions had been added tonight to test out and were shown a new, additional menu with around 10 new items. We thought nothing of it at the time but you'll soon learn why this was an issue. We had placed our order at around 5:45 and by the time 6:40 had rolled around we still had not received our meals and the manager came over to tell us the kitchen had backed up and our meals would be out in a minute. 15 minutes later our meals finally arrived,  about on hour after we had ordered them.  Mine as well as my Dad's arrived cold and my mom's arrived wrong as well as burnt. The manager offered to fix my mom's meal but she simply made do because she didn't want to wait another hour. The waitress (a different one as Nicole had gone on break) offered to take mine back and get a new plate but by the time she came around I was already halfway done and didn't want to wait any longer. Thankfully, the comped my meal and gave us free cheesecake which was generous and we were thankful for that. But the experience didn't end there.  After we had finished eating we spent another 30-45 minutes simply just waiting to check out. This was due to the fact the the Break waitress had run the wrong table and had to go through and cancel everything to redo it. Nicole was very straight up with us when she came backs as well as apologetic for what had happened, even stating how bad she felt and we appreciated the honesty but truthfully we were anxious to get out as our dinner experience had already lasted 2 hours.  Word to the wise Cheesecake Factory: Don't test 10 additional menu items on the busiest night of the week. The kitchen can't handle it, it stresses out and causes a multitude of problems for managers and waiters/waitresses and makes really unhappy customers. I know for a fact that we were not the only table that the manager had to come to for a problem, so I'm sure that my family as well as others had a very long and unhappy Saturday night dinner all thanks to the Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville?start=120,3.36,3.56,3.464,2.8240000000000003,3.4800000000000004

We have had three visits in the past year, with exception to ""date night"" where it was just my Husband and myself, the other two times we had a part of 8, and a party of 11.  On both the occasions where we were with large parties, our WAIT time was over 2 hours.  That being said, it is understandable that there would be a wait.  The first time, it was a FAMILY gathering, we were told multiple different times that our table would be ""coming soon.""  After the 5th time you've heard that, you start getting irked.  On the second occasion, it was the evening of Sierra College graduation, and it rained that night prompting the ceremony to be cleared due to rain/lightening.  When we arrived, we were told an hour wait, by the time we were seated, it was 2 hours and 26 minutes later.  The ""thing"" that really bothers me is the REPEATED TIMES we were given, ""Your table should be ready soon.""  No, it wasn't.  Now, my vision of customer service (especially on visit # 3 where the MANAGER became involved) there was NO offer of free appetizer, dessert......nothing.  THAT is not good customer service. The food was VERY slow coming out, and 3 orders were wrong.  The server was EXCELLENT, so we brushed it off and adhered to our 18% tip policy.  Now, ONE of those entrees should have been given FREE of charge, but again, NOTHING. We won't go with large groups ever again, perhaps just our date nights.  Hoping that any Manager seeing this review considers the ""wording"" to large parties as far as when their table might be ready.   The food is typically pretty good, even if I don't eat cheesecake!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville?start=60,3.48,3.55,3.504,2.6320000000000006,3.5220000000000002

I only came here cause a friend dragged me in here, she really like the place. For me, it seemed just too busy, not too many people wise, but the atmosphere I found far from relaxing. The service was fast and efficient and all bubbly in a rehearsed chain restaurant kind of way. The menu is huge to so many choices it's too had to decide. We started with the fried calamari for $13. It was a pretty standard prep and similar to what most sports bar make, but $13 , I thought was a bit high. For my lunch, I had Fish and Chips $18 and my friend had the Chinese Chicken Salad for $15. The food was tasty enough, nothing to make me gush, but the prices for what you get sort of left a sour taste in my mouth, like I sort of felt ripped off by our $60 lunch with tax and tip and all I got was Fish and chips and a shared appetizer of calamari.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville?start=60,3.36,3.52,3.488,2.6640000000000006,3.4560000000000004

I got there and I had to wait in line 30 minutes because you pick you food up at the same counter where they have customers indecisively picking out cheesecake.

My husband turkey burger had a massive amount of grilled onions on it, my roast dip was way too salty, and put fries were hard.

I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants to begin with and definitely not the restaurants that do it all. Mexican, Italian, Asian and so much more all packed into an enormous menu. You know that saying? Jack of all traits is a master of none, well this definitely confirmed that theory.. Came here for my husbands company dinner and left pretty disappointed. The biggest disappointment was the service, followed by the less than average meals provided.  Our waitress ( forgot her name) was just blah... not friendly or personable. No general knowledge of the menu or drinks and carried a smart ass kinda attitude.  My hubby wanted a Bloody Mary and asked how they were here ( not all Bloody Marys are created equal) , her answer "" ah I don't know, aren't they all the same? Never had one come back!"" Really?  That's the best you can do? What a turn off! Same snotty , unbecoming attitude continued throughout the evening and especially when it came time to splitting the bill. It took every good part of me to keep me from ripping her a new one. God knows, I'm trying to be a better person. We saw our waitress a total of 3 times through our entire night, once to take orders, one drink refill and to pay the bill. That's it's! Forget the "" do you need anything?"" The "" how's your food?"" Or "" would you like another martini?"" No where to be found.  Forgive the rant but when have people given up on service and stopped taking pride in their work? Since when doing just the bare minimum become sufficient?  Food was just ok, not good, not bad. Pretty to the eye but lacking in flavor. Over cooked pork chop and bland fish tacos bout sums it up. Edible but certainly not enjoyable. I had to pour hot sauce on my tacos for flavor for Christ's sake ! In all honesty I really wanted to give this place a 1 star review but the delicious dirty vodka martinis could not be ignored.

I read all the other posts and see that when someone didn't receive the kind of service we all expect from Cheesecake factory or any other (non fast food) average chain restaurants, the replies are copy and pasted. The promise to address the issues and limit the experience to an isolated one, is obviously not being done properly or at all. Someone who truly understands customer service should be put on the payroll and some serious training of staff should occur. After my personal experience was mishandled by both the server and manager on duty, I write to you to open your eyes and expect to receive a little more than oops we are sorry and we will do better next time. I find that I am disappointed yet again.  How my situation should have been handled is: After I informed you that the food was not prepared properly, the Manager should have made sure it was perfect the second time. The 2nd plate should have been made fresh with all side dishes fresh as well. This didn't happen! The 2nd dish came out looking worse than the first and even less meat than the first dish had. It was sloppily presented as well. When I pointed this out to the Manager who personally delivered the second dish, He should have apologized again, asked if he could have 1 more chance to make it right and then he should have not charged me for that dish. To go a step even further, he could have given me his business card and wrote some type of goodwill gesture on the card. Perhaps a discount on the next visit or a free appetizer or something that goes beyond minimum effort! If you all want to improve your service, you need to think outside the box. I would have written a wonderful review and praised your actions, had you handled the situation better.  I live in Rocklin, there are many good restaurants around. You were on my list of better restaurants. Please get with the program and see to it that improvements are made. PLEASE!  #1 I am so disappointed in the service I received this evening. My family and I met for dinner. I arrived early and had a few martini's. Once my wife and daughter arrived we ordered dinner. I ordered the medallions medium rare. It arrived dry and gray in color. Very well done. I don't like to complain but wanted to enjoy the meal. I decided to mention the meat was overcooked to my waitress. Her reply......""Let me send it back, I didn't cook it!"" ??? What? My family tries to wait but didn't want to let their food get cold or soggy. They finished their meals. Finally a manager came over and apologized for the overcooked order. I mentioned the response I received from the waitress. The Manager said he would speak with her. 15 minutes later the manger hand delivered my newly cooked dish. The meat was again dry and gray in color. The mashed potatoes were dry and appeared to be from my original order. I hurried to cut two medallions in half showing the manager how the meat was cooked well done again. He looked at me with a look that told me he was done helping me. I said the meat is still over cooked and the meal appeared to be dry overall. I received a blank stare from the manager. I said we'll, I don't have more time to wait for yet another replacement meal. The manager just walked away. Soon after the waitress returned and stated; she was sorry for her remark and added usually people laugh at her remark that she didn't cook the meal. I looked at my wife and daughter in disbelief. Is this customer service at Cheesecake Factory? I think not!  ",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville?start=60,2.92,3.38,3.484,2.568,3.196

We ordered Tex mex egg rolls for an app. Our waiter came by shortly and said they were out of the egg rolls and if we wanted something else. So we decided on the taquitos. Shortly after that the manager comes by and she apologizes and says they are out of the mix and asked if we wanted something else. We went with the hot wings and she comped us for that. Which we appreciate!  Here's what bugged the crap out of me. The table to the left of us ordered 5 mins before we did. The table to the right of us had a different waiter who took their order 10 mins after we got seated.

I agreed he could have them remake it. Shortly after I believe it was a supervisor that came up and apologized about the inconvenience and assured me it would come out perfect! I said thank you and about 10 min later a fresh order came out. Before the waiter left he said how is this.. I took my fork and scraped off a puddle of breading.. it was way worse than the first time! At that point I lost my appetite. My fiancé had stopped eating waiting for me to get the remake.. so now her food had been sitting for 20 min. The waiter took my food back and the supervisor came back and said we took it off your bill and had it grilled up more.. we ended up leaving the remade food because it was still mush and wasn't happy at all.. so we received the bill and paid it.. still tipped 15% because it wasn't the waiters fault.. still ended up paying almost 60 bucks..  2 sodas  1 potsticker order 2 pieces of cheese cake Her lettuce wraps. Very disappointed and probably won't be returning. The staff was nice. I'm not one to write reviews often but I had to.. sorry Cheese cake factory.. you have failed us..,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville?start=60,3.08,3.19,3.444,3.0120000000000005,3.146

48,Jessica H.,"Davis, CA",11,26,12.0,3.0,2017-09-23,"There's a reason they don't call this the Pasta Factory. We ordered a Chicken Bellagio and Louisiana Chicken Pasta, both popular enough dishes to warrant copycat recipes on the internet.  The Louisiana Chicken Pasta is bow tie pasta (haven't had that since elementary school!) dotted with little slices of mushroom and red bell peppers topped with parmesan breaded chicken breast. The pasta itself was bland and the sauce lacked Cajun flair. The breaded chicken was delicious: tender and flavorful and dusted with cayenne pepper for an added kick. It saved what would otherwise have been a really lackluster dish. The Chicken Bellagio is basil pasta and cream sauce topped with breaded chicken (yay!) and arugula. Arugula itself is slightly bitter, and the dressing was just plain sour. Interesting combination. I felt like I was being punished with a healthy serving of greens before I was allowed to dig into the rest of the dish. Once again, the highlight of the dish was in it's breaded chicken: tender, delicious (but no cayenne pepper here). The pasta itself tastes like a bland rendition of pesto pasta. What does it matter if the basil is in the pasta or in the sauce? We topped off the evening with some Coffee and Creme Chocolate Supreme cheesecake. You know it was good because it rhymed and because well this is the Cheesecake Factory.  Overall, the experience was as expected and consistent with other Cheesecake Factory restaurants I'd been to in the past.  Special shoutout to our server, Jenna, for being super sweet and recommending the awesome dessert. If this review were for your service, alone, I'd be rating a hell of a lot more than 3 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville?start=20,3.08,3.18,3.448,3.2440000000000007,3.1400000000000006

This restaurant is usually one of our favorites because of their awesome menu and typically great food but it has been awhile since we've eaten here. Today was a game changer. The service was fine but the quality of food has gone down and the prices have gone thru the roof. I almost always order the Factory Chopped salad which is considered an appetizer salad. That salad, which was $8.95 not long ago is now $13.95!!! The turkey burgers we ordered had no taste and they were the size of a very small sausage patty. So disappointing. The salad that came with it was a small handful of spring mix with dressing. This ""salad"" consisted in nothing else.

27,Sherri G.,"Rocky River, OH",61,132,137.0,5.0,2017-10-15,"I so appreciate this cheesecake factory location. The food is always fresh and the menu options so extensive that I can't fathom anyone not finding something they enjoy or are in the mood for on this menu. My difficulty is often deciding what to order. What I love most about this location is there ease of carry out. I travel to this area once a month and always find myself having at least one night where I just need to grab and go but do want typical fast food. Cheesecake factory makes take out a breeze. You can call ahead and have the option of coming in to pick up or you can drive up to one of their pick up parking spaces in the mall parking lot. they have four or five parking spaces allocated to drive up pick-up. All you have to do is call the phone number on the sign when you arrive and one of their cheerful staff will deliver the food right to your car.  Yesterday after a full day of weather related Airport flight delays I arrived into my hotel area after 11:30pm.  I was worried that my only option would be some 24 hour fast food chain. To my delight Cheesecake Factory was open until 12:30 AM. I ordered the Renee's  special which came with your choice of a chicken salad or club sandwich and soup or salad.  I chose the chicken salad sandwich which was served on a brioche toast and there soup which was a hearty baked potato, delicious. It really put a positive note on a difficult day. I would highly recommend if you are going to do carry out that you spend some time preparing by looking over their menu online, especially if you are adding in cheesecake which is always the end to a great meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville,3.64,3.27,3.484,3.3480000000000003,3.418

Looking around I could see that this was a typical Cheesecake Factory restaurant. Modern, classy look and feel and very good service. Why mess with a solid business model. I started with a Conn Creek Cabernet Sauvignon and ... a club soda to stay hydrated. Then, I ordered a cup of soup and a small green salad. The soup was a chili, lime, chicken tortilla and it was delicious. Chicken cubes in a rich broth, fresh lime juice, green onion, cilantro, cumin, red peppers and corn tortilla strips (and much more I can't identify). Generous serving.

21,Candace Y.,"Elk Grove, CA",83,395,486.0,4.0,2017-12-22,"While doing some Christmas shopping, we decided to grab a few appetizers as a light lunch /snack to refuel.  As you might expect, the shopping hordes were out in numbers, and there was a bit of a line. As we waited to be seated, I noticed a separate table set up to sell gift cards across from the cheesecake to go counter.   It looked like they were accommodating the extra traffic for to-go dessert products well. Once led to our table, I noticed the decor and the various glass light fixtures illuminating the space.  There were several sconce-style lamps that resembled the Eye of Sauron and a few that looked steam-punky with reddish-brown glass cones with black iron supports. (It's a pretty cool effect.).  We quickly picked three appetizers:  the Cubano, the samosa, and the mushroom plate.   While we waited for them to be prepared, we were pleased with the bread and plate of butter that was served to us.  The brown wheat bread was very good, and the sourdough was not bad.  The butter was soft enough to spread easily, I observed. The food came, and we dug in.  The small plates were pleasingly presented.   I was hungry enough to have to consciously slow myself down to taste and enjoy.   All three dishes were pretty good, albeit the Cubano was a tad on the oily side.  The mushrooms were savory with the seasonings.  The samosas came with a white sauce that went well with each crisp bite.   The service was good.  It was quick and courteous service.  I get the sense that this establishment has a good training program.  We'd been seated by one person, who subsequently introduced us to our server.   After the bread and the order-taking, there was a shift change, and we were introduced to the subsequent server.   We did not experience any lapse in service, which was a pleasant surprise.   I do believe that this enhanced our experience.  I will confess that I do not normally frequent large chain restaurants, but this dining experience was unexpectedly quite pleasant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville,3.68,3.23,3.48,,3.41

358,Mary J.,"Rocklin, CA",0,5,,2.0,2018-01-05,"We went there on December 31th 2017 just to have our last dinner for the year. It was obviously busy as expected. The waitress was super helpful, smiled and checked on us every few minutes despite the busy work; thus the 2 Starr rating. Food was nothing to write home about. The chicken was burnt, the hamburger patties were over cooked and dry, my daughters pizza pepperoni pizza were so dry with edges folding and burnt. Our bill came to $155.00 and I tipped the waitress $20.00. She was awesome. We asked to package our food after we all took few bites and decided it was horrible. As soon as we hit the packing lot, we found a trash can and dumped it all there. We had an order to go for my hubby we brought it home for him there were 3 pieces of shrimp and about 6 pieces of chicken in the shrimp and chicken pasta meal. We chose not to complain to our waitress because she had no control of how bad the kitchen performed but she knew that we were displeased with our orders. We have been to the Arden location prior and love the food there. I have pictures of our meals. .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville?start=40,3.56,3.29,3.508,,3.398
