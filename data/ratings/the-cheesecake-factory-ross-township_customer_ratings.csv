58,Stacie C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",146,536,1322.0,4.0,2012-02-27,"My friend and I arrived early on a Sunday for brunch.  Our server William was very helpful and friendly.  He went over the menu and asked if we had any questions as I had never been there before.  I told him it really wasn't necessary because even though I hadn't been there before, I was far from unprepared.  He then went on to tell is, ""It's going to be a good day"" and how he picks one day every three weeks or so and decides it's going to be his birthday.  I like the way he thinks. It felt like MY birthday when my Morning Quesadilla arrived.  There were so many goodies in there, I couldn't believe it.  And goodies on the side, too - heaping piles of salsa, sour cream and guacamole.  So delicious.  I highly recommend.  I also ordered the Lemon-Ricotta Pancakes because I've heard such good things about them.  They tasted almost as good as they smelled which was heavenly.  But after my quesadilla I was only able to eat a portion of the pancakes, even when assisted by my friend.  I took home the leftovers and they were still delicious the next day. I also ordered a piece of Godiva cheesecake to go.  I don't think I've ever been disappointed by a piece of their cheesecake and this was some chocolatey goodness. The place was hopping when we left, so I would recommend getting there early (i.e. when they open) to enjoy the brunch menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-ross-township?start=40,3.024,3.024,3.024,3.024,3.024
114,Rachael B.,"Valencia, PA",7,23,,4.0,2012-03-01,"Great experience, service was very attentive and on top of their game. We had a table of eight and they still managed to keep everyone's drinks filled and the bread basket full. We ordered the artichoke dip as an appetizer; a bit on the disappointing side. The chips were nice and crispy, but a little over-salted. I went with something I knew was good there...the Herb Encrusted Salmon with Asparagus and Mashed Potatoes (ha I write it like it's a move title). Anyways, it never fails to disappoint! They cooked the salmon medium rare (the way it SHOULD be cooked!) and the lemon butter sauce gave a nice sour edge to the entire meal. The decor is nice and laid back, although the lighting gets to be a bit too dim by the end of the night, at least in our section. Sometimes I feel like they crowd their menu a bit too much thus serving a lot of so-so dishes. They could benefit from a good spring cleaning of the menu :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-ross-township?start=100,3.024,3.024,3.024,3.024,3.024
89,Amy S.,"Brooklyn, NY",100,485,124.0,4.0,2012-03-10,"I think this is a good place to go when the members of your group can't agree on what to eat.. because they have almost everything you could possibly want. Sandwiches, burgers, pasta, seafood, chicken, steak, pizza, appetizers, and other stuff. And cheesecake of course. I got the jambalaya pasta today. I was in the mood for something spicy and this did the trick. It wasn't too hot where I was dying while eating, but good enough to get the kick. The chicken was so soft and the shrimp perfectly cooked. The linguine was really good too! Only thing was, it was a bit too oily and kind of heavy. (Sidenote: this dish only comes in full portion. I wish it came in lunch size because it's pretty big.) My friend and I also split a chocolate raspberry cheesecake. At first it's really good! but then it gets to be a bit too rich for my taste. Same for her, because we couldn't even finish it. Also, we were really full.  I really enjoy coming here cause they have good food, but sometimes their food is a bit too heavy/rich for my taste and the waits are really long. Also, because there are so many people service can be a bit slow sometime. Not unbearably slow, but noticeably slow. No reservations either. So, yeah. But their bread is good!

The service was all you could wish for, the atmosphere is chain, the cheese cake looked good. I chose a healthy chopped vegetable salad that was meh, fine. I can't even find descriptive words for it. It was as if on a lazy day I cleaned out the fridge of bits and ends of cooked and raw veggies. Mostly lettuce, huge bowl, couple chunks of asparagus, unexceptional dressing, a couple pieces of beet, a handful of good cheddar chunks on the top for $10 without chicken.   For $12 I could have gone to Mad Mex and had a similarly large salad with lots of grilled chicken and a spicy sauce, for $7.50 I could have had a homemade Thai soup with drunken noodles at Red Orchid.

(I ordered 2 chicken salads and a piece of cheesecake).  I sat around for about 25 min. and was a little annoyed with the extra time because a large amount of the staff was standing around.  When my order came out, the woman who was at the bakery was easily the hardest working person at the time.  She was apologetic for my order taking extra time and gave me an extra piece of cheesecake at no additional cost.  I was very appreciative of this since I didn't ask for it.  She said it was the least they could do for making me wait longer.  We were very satisfied with this level of customer service.  Everything was good and we enjoyed our meal.   The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 was the fact that this woman was killing herself at the bakery doing orders left and right while there were several other staff members standing around the bakery watching her work, not offering help, and at times they even seemed not aware that there were customers standing 5 feet away from them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-ross-township?start=80,3.152,3.152,3.152,3.152,3.152

When I stopped here at around 2pm the wait was about an hour they said so I found an open seat at the bar and ordered there.  The draft beer was pretty good, the rib eye steak with mashed potatoes was fantastic. I got the strawberry cheesecake for dessert and wasn't impressed. You figure The Cheesecake Factory would have great cheesecake but it tasted like it was made of a thick pudding. Maybe I'm used to New York type cheesecake, pretty firm with some nice taste, this wasn't it.  The place was packed and noisy, when i left around 4pm they were saying the wait was about 1.5 hours.

75,Ken P.,"Pittsburgh, PA",18,19,,4.0,2013-07-16,"Part of me doesn't want to like this place, but let's be honest...for the most part, the food is freakin' delicious.  What I'm trying to get past though is the 500 page menu with nothing that is particularly healthy. Also, as a general rule I try to stay away from chains (it helps me feel more snobby). But like I said at the Cheesecake Factory, everything seems to taste great. On our last trip I went with the ""Bang Bang Chicken."" Sure, it wasn't what I'd expect from an authentic Thai restaurant, but I wouldn't have been at the CF if I wanted authentic Thai. For an American take on the dish I'll say it tasted awesome. If nutrition is on your mind, it's a bit tough to navigate the menu. You'll probably be able to get out under 1,000 calories, but you need to know what to look for, limit the alcohol intake and skip dessert.

The bad: -It's very popular.  LOTS of people here at all hours.  It is not surprising to have wait times 1-2 hours on any day of the week at any hour of the evening. -The drinks cost a small fortune.  My wife and I waited two hours for a table one night and thought...""why don't we just have a couple drinks while we wait?""  We did.  We paid our bar tab and then bought dinner and wine.  When we paid for the meal it cost less than the bar bill had for two drinks each. Best way to enjoy the Cheesecake Factory is go an hour or so before you really want to eat and get on the waiting list.  Take a buzzer with you into the mall, shop for a while and then check back.  Otherwise, the wait is too long.  Plan ahead, and it's a nice evening meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-ross-township?start=40,3.24,3.24,3.24,3.0520000000000005,3.2400000000000007

The decor is always awful and quite frankly I have no idea what it has to do with cheesecake. I also wonder why they make their servers dress in white. It seems like a bad idea because they will always look dirty. You just can't keep white clean in a restaurant. I think they want you to feel like you're in heaven but if so, it must be the dodgy part.  The food is decent but I find their portions to be way too large creating inflated prides. Also, their menu is so large it seems impossible for them to make anything amazing food-wise. I do like their cheesecake but I question the amount of unnecessary ingredients they use.  We ordered the white bean chicken chili from the Skinny menu (because we wanted normal portions). And we also shared the kabob appetizer. Both were among the most enjoyable things I've gotten there. The chili was very good and a bit spicy. The kabob could have been better but I wasn't expecting authentic kabob taste. The meat was the disappointing part. The yogurt sauce was good though.    Our waitress last nice gave us an extra 25 minutes to decide on dessert since we weren't ready the first time.

My first recommendation is to get there when it opens otherwise you will be waiting quite some time for a seat. Normally when I eat there I go for lunch since they serve huge portions. I normally order a lunch salad and it is so huge I really can't eat much more of anything else. They do serve two kinds of bread with your meal. My favorite is the brown bread with white seeds on top. They do have various cheesecakes in a cooler case when you enter so you can see the various types. You can also purchase them for takeout.

The green beans were slightly salty but the asparagus was on point!  The pasta was effin' yummy.  The coating on the chicken was thin and crispy, and the pasta was al dente (hell yes!).   As always, portions were HUGE - def. enough for a second lunch, ha!  Oh, and the bread here was really good!  It came out totally fresh - warm bread FTW.  Our waitress was really nice and attentive.  I'll DEFINITELY be back again.

It should be the ultimate place to dine while at the mall!  Beautiful interior, soaring ceilings, custom painted fancy columns, dark wood booths.  Service is friendly and generally spot on.   Back to the menu (complete with advertisements, am I the only one that finds this so tacky?), you can get pizza, pasta,(including jambalaya style) seafood, steaks and chops, salads, sandwiches, burgers, omelets and Sunday Brunch.  For beverages, they serve wine, beer, cocktails, frozen drinks, espresso, milkshakes.  Again, you want it, they got it.   Quantities can sometimes be too large.  I got a salad here one time that was so big it was almost embarrassing.  I could not longer see my date over my salad.  It was more greens that I could eat in one week.  Oh, and the cheesecake.  The choices here are also over the top and decedent.  But really, who has room left for dessert?  Of course, they are more than happy to bag it up for you to take out.

55,Grandin H.,"Sacramento, CA",1,37,,2.0,2016-04-13,"I know exactly what to expect from Cheesecake Factory restaurants. The food is always consistent, they have plenty of choices (maybe even too many), and the cheesecake is rich and delicious. I've been here a few times during off-peak hours and there is sometimes still a wait. The wait on weekends just isn't worth it.  The food is rich. Everything is rich. Sauces, toppings, cheese... and if those weren't heavy enough, they bring warm endless baskets of bread with butter. Hmmm, can anyone really leave without dessert? OK, it's delicious. Yes, it's delicious. But, this isn't the place you want to eat three times a week, or you'll soon be buying a new wardrobe. (Check out their calorie counts for each menu item--some entrees have a whole day's worth of calories--and that's before you add on appetizers, bread, and, of course, the cheesecake!) Enough of that...  The menu is about a half inch thick with lots of variety. It's a 'something-for-everyone' place that offers seafood, meat, poultry, and pasta. Most of the entrees are pasta-based meals in very generous portions. We usually leave with plenty of leftovers to make another meal.  Every Cheesecake Factoy I've ever visited has the exact same menu, the exact same portions, and the exact same decor. Once inside, you can't tell if you're in a Cheesecake Factory in Florida, or a Cheesecake Factory in Pennsylvania, or a Cheesecake Factory in Moscow (if there are any in Moscow!) There is a reason they call this place a 'Factory.' It's like going into an expensive McDonald's--you know exactly what to expect, both good and bad. The decor is 'Bellagio' meets 'Disney World.'  The interior of this place (like all other Cheesecake Factories) is someone's idea of ancient Rome (I think). It looks like the interior of most houses on that old TV show ""Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous' proving that there is no correlation between wealth and good taste.  As everyone else comments, the wait is long--sometimes painfully long--and the seating is often cramped. They don't accept reservations, and the range of the pagers is not too far from the front entrance. The hostess will give you a fairly accurate estimation of how long your wait will be, so you're probably safe taking a walk around the mall and returning reasonably often to ask, 'How much longer....?' That's IF you really want to eat here. When I do go here, I usually plan on a late lunch/early dinner (3PM) or visit on weekday evenings. I have to admit, I started this review with 5 stars, and as I wrote all the negatives, I kept whittling away at stars, until I ended up giving them 2. If you're in the mood for heavy, rich, 'comfort' food, by all means splurge (both calories and $$$) and eat here. I usually go here when friends suggest it.

A little too sticky and there were odd bits of lettuce in the cheese (when the sandwich does not contain lettuce). Wasn't a fan.

It wasn't anything spectacular but they do give you a healthy portion.  The bread that came with the meal was fairly good.  The couple we came split fried chicken and mashed potatoes as well as a salad.  I was a little more envious of their meal than mine.  For dessert, we had the Tuxedo cheesecake in a to go box which for sure exceeded my expectations.   Overall, this is a very expensive place to go eat at.  Our meal was around $60 for 2 dinners and a dessert.  I'm not opposed to come back, but if I'm going to spend $60 for dinner I will go somewhere nicer.  I think the menu does have items that are reasonable and that I would look to get if I end up going here again.  The cheesecake is for sure excellent, so I wouldn't hesitate to stop in to pick up dessert sometime.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-ross-township,3.88,3.88,3.88,2.732,3.88

Once we arrived there was a 25 to 30 minute wait which I didn't mind. Once our pager went off we almost literally broke our necks walking to our table as the floor was so slippery.  Once seated our waitress Meghan came and took our drink orders. We hadn't been to a Cheesecake Factory in a while so it was nice to see some new items on the menu. When we finally decided what we wanted I chose the Pasta with Shrimp and Sausage and my wife chose the Chicken Chipotle Pasta. A few minutes later Meghan came back with our bread. 10 to 15 minutes later Meghan came back and said that our food would be coming soon. By this time a few other groups had been seated and placed their orders as well. Another twenty five minutes later we still have no food. All of the other tables around us had gotten their drinks, appetizers and entrees and we still had nothing! Finally we got our food almost 45 minutes after being seated. We did not order appetizers just entrees so we had bread and water until our food finally came. By this time I was really feeling some type of way! At least our food as good! After I got our check and paid I was going to just let it go but I couldn't so I asked to speak to the manager. Once she came over I let her know what happened. I let her know they we had been come to the Cheesecake Factory for over twenty years and never once had to wait that long for food. She apologized and offered us a piece of cheesecake. I usually enjoy the Cheesecake Factory, but after this experience, I don't know when or if I will return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-ross-township,3.12,3.39,3.39,,3.282
24,Chengchen L.,"Pittsburgh, PA",15,7,37.0,4.0,2017-09-05,"Food was great, service was a little slow as the place was packed, highly recommend making a reservation even if it is during the week...we went there on a wed night and we had to wait for 20min and then they messed up and some other ppl took our table so we had to wait longer. The waiter was nice, but you can tell he gets irritated when we ask questions since it was so busy and he prob had other things he needs to do...we had the eggroll sampler, the chicken sandwich and pineapple shrimp, and my daughter really liked her bowtie alfredo. All the food was great with generous portions, next time i go i will be sure to make a reservation",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-ross-township?start=20,3.2,3.39,3.39,,3.314

0,Eric T.,"McKnight, PA",0,3,,4.0,2017-10-26,"Generally do a great job but I've got a rant.  You changed the eggplant parm dish.  The new dish is awful.  Please go back to your old preparation.  I'm guessing the new one comes straight from a freezer to the microwave to your table which is the reason for the change.  The previous dish was beautifully prepared.  I liked it so much I had most of my family ordering it as well.   Lastly, I've enjoyed some very nice meals at the bar.  Can't recall the gal's name but she is a gem and I've gone back just because of her.   I'm going to give 4 stars as I think you do a good job but you have to fix that eggplant dish.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-ross-township,3.16,3.41,3.41,,3.31
13,Andy M.,"Carmel, IN",0,23,,3.0,2017-12-26,Bring your headlamp and a jacket!  This place is dark as a cave and almost as cold.  We actually got our iPhone flashlights out to see our food.  Was seated by the window which was quite breezy.  Food is always good but the atmosphere left little to be desired.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-ross-township,3.16,3.4,3.4,,3.3040000000000007
4,Gwen K.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,20,13.0,5.0,2018-01-01,Even tho the price is high but it worth every penny. Sometimes I just go there to buy cake. The only downside is the wait. Line is always long.

6,Roya G.,"Pittsburgh, PA",128,7,11.0,4.0,2018-01-05,"Ahhh the cheesecake factory. An absolute nightmare for indecisive people like myself. 3 menus (regular, special, and skinnylicious) for me to debate over until I just about give up and order something spontaneous because the waitress has visited my table 3 times now asking if I ""still need more time"". And that begins our tale. My fellow yelper Madilyn and I headed into the Cheesecake factory tonight with an open mind... Yet I felt my choices were still made poorly. ANYWAYS, I got chicken samosas as my starter - it was actually delicious. Super hot and crispy, well spiced, and the cilantro sauce was an excellent pairing. Reminded me of a good Indian restaurant. Okay so the entree is where I feel I made the wrong decision. I ordered the Cajun jambalaya pasta, which was listed as being ""very spicy"". First off... not spicy at all. So that was disappointing. Also the pasta was definitely overcooked, WAY past al dente and starting to all stick together.. almost mushy. I think there were 4 pieces of small shrimp. It still had an OK flavor - just not what I was expecting for $19. Ended up taking most of it home. OH- I also got a moscow mule and an asian pear martini. The moscow mule didn't even come in a copper mug... I wish I took a picture to show how sad it looked but it wasn't even worthy of one. But I gotta say the pear martini was amazing. I'm still giving 4 stars because of the following reasons - friendly, attentive staff - nice atmosphere - extensive menu - great bread/butter to start - it was actually WARM inside compared to other restaurants i've been to lately. Always a pleasant experience, as I've been here many times before. Will surely be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-ross-township,3.32,3.43,3.43,,3.386
5,Kelsey V.,"Hollsopple, PA",111,10,30.0,4.0,2018-01-07,A Vann sister favorite! The Cheesecake Factory always is a big hit with us. Today I got the Louisiana Chicken pasta and split the Fried Mac & Cheese Balls with my sister. The pasta has a nice kick to it and breading on the chicken is light and crunchy. The only downside today was I found a dark long hair in my pasta. The Mac & Cheese was fantastic as always though.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-ross-township,3.32,3.43,3.43,,3.386
2,Kelly V.,"Pittsburgh, PA",97,40,144.0,4.0,2018-01-07,"While it was super busy, Kelsey and I walked in and were seated right away. We started with the bread and butter (we both love the brown bread) followed by the Mac & Cheese appetizer. It's huge! It comes with four pieces total. Very good! I had the Farfalle chicken pasta with garlic. I've had this dish before and today it was just okay. Overall we have a great lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-ross-township,3.44,3.43,3.43,,3.434
3,Erica S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",51,78,62.0,4.0,2018-01-10,This visit I ordered the veggie burger and the side salad. The veggie burger has a really good taste to it. It's made out of black beans and rice and It comes with lettuce tomato onion and pickles on it. I added mushrooms because I put them on everything as well it came with a piece of cheese. The only thing about the burger is that it breaks apart easily. The salad is really fresh and comes with pieces of tomato and I believe little peppers. The balsamic that they toss it with is very VERY light. Just tasted like wet lettuce. I still have them a 4 Star because they normally have excellent food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-ross-township,3.56,3.43,3.43,,3.482
12,Kimberly B.,"Findlay, OH",26,6,2.0,1.0,2018-01-13,"My first time at a Cheesecake Factory and I was severely disappointed. The wait was about an hour, which I was ok with especially after hearing so many rave reviews of the food and cheesecake. While waiting I couldn't help but be distracted by one of the front desk girls who was constantly on her cell phone while patrons were trying to get her attention. Once we were seated, our waiter was nice enough. I ended up ordering their fish and chips and my husband ordered their club sandwich. When the food came I have 5 smallish pieces of fish and fries (I got a salad instead of the coke slaw). At first, I thought the portion size was a bit small for being over $17 for the meal but I figured it must be good. My fish was over cooked and unseasoned. It was chewy!  My husbands club sandwich was ok although the bread was over toasted as well. When I asked for extra ketchup our waiter gave me a nasty look and walked away. I assumed he hadn't heard me and must have gave a weird look for another reason. He did come back with the ketchup. We got cheesecake to go and I haven't had it yet but I sure hope it is awesome!  I will not go back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-ross-township,3.44,3.41,3.41,,3.422
