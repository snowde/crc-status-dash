1747,A g.,"Fairfield, United States",31,14,7.0,1.0,2012-01-04,"My date and I came here and will NEVER come back! My date ordered a steak cooked well done and received a steak burnt on the outside and blood red on the inside while it was already swimming in it's own blood. He cut the corner piece off and wouldn't eat it. We called the manager over who apologized and took it back for what we thought would be a replacement. They brought back the EXACT SAME STEAK WITH THE PIECE HE CUT OFF PUSHED AGAINST THE REST OF THE STEAK!!!! How filthy and unsanitary! We don't know where that steak had been between our table and the kitchen. Not to mention the fact that not only was it cooked to one temperature then cooled to almost room temp and then placed back on the stove to bring the temp up again?? Is that safe?  I ordered the chicken bellagio which tasted like the butter noodles I used to eat when I didn't have anything else to eat, it tasted like poor mans food except it cost $15 freakin bucks. The chicken was doughy with no taste at all. To top it all off we were seated next to a servers station where this tall chick wearing glasses with a gap and black hair. She bitched and complained about how she could be at home right now and these people were getting on her nerves. Then she says thanks for letting me vent, I turned and told her be thankful she had a job and next time I don't want to hear all of that crap on MY evening with my man. I will never and I mean never come here again it was an absolute waste of time and money. They did comp our cheesecake slices which were obviously amazing but other than that consider the cheesecake factory dead to me.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=680,3.56,3.49,3.572,2.5320000000000005,3.5180000000000002

During lunch time, I usually get the pasta lunch special where you can order a lunch sized portion of their select pasta dishes.  It's cheaper than dinner prices and I've never been able to finish a whole one by myself.  The cream sauce for their pasta dishes is simply divine, so whenver I go, I ALWAYS order the Fettucine Alfredo or the Pasta Carbonara.  What's really awesome about it is that I can change the type of pasta used int he dish.  The Pasta Carbonara is supposed to come with Spaghettini, but I prefer Penne pasta.  They change it, no problem, and there isn't any extra charge!  When I go for dinner, I usually order the same thing as lunch.  What can I say, I'm a creature of habit. The only difference, I've just started ordering cheesecake for dessert.  My preference, the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake.  Oh.  Em. Gee!!!  AMAZING!! It's sweet, chocolatey goodness in my mouth! Granted, it is quite rich and I can never eat the whole thing in one sitting, so I always take it home and eat it for breakfast the next day!

I stand there in front of the display like a little kid trying to figure out which one I want to try out at the end of our dinner!  We ended up ordering the Chicken samosas, Crab cake bites, side salad with house vinaigrette and the Rib eye.  The chicken samosas were yummy... but the cilantro dip was a little too plain. I tasted more of the sour cream. but otherwise still a yummy appetizer. It came with 4 samosas.  The crab cake bites were scrumptious!!! Perfectly fried and paired with a mustard dipping sauce. I would say that the 6 mini bites are equivalent to 1 regular size crab cake.  As far as the side salad goes... there really isn't much to say, beside that the purple cabbage should either be drenched in the vinaigrette or at least be separated so it is able to absorb some more of the dressing as well.  The rib eye was fine. It was cooked a little too well done. We asked for medium. But it was still ok. Nothing to brag about here.

I met a friend here for lunch on a Monday, and the place wasn't too busy and we only had about a fifteen minute wait which isn't bad for a restaurant that seems to be very popular.   We were seated in a booth and were greeted by the most BLANDEST waiters ever.  He seriously didn't have a personality or was just having a bad day and didn't want to work.  Oh well.  My friend and I both ordered a strawberry lemonade (totally hit the spot) and my friend ordered the chicken fettucine and I ordered the chicken enchiladas.  I wasn't expecting much since this place seems to have such a vast menu and definitely didn't specialize in enchiladas.  However, I was quite surprised at how tasty they were.  I was served three decent sized enchiladas topped with melted cheeses and a side of black beans and rice.  My friend, although he ordered the half size of the fettucine, received quite a large portion as well.  Maybe that's why everyone loves this place - great portions!  My enchiladas were so good that I would definitely order them again. What I like most about The CF is that the place is huge and spacious.  The menu is another plus because literally anyone could find something on the menu to their liking.  They have a bit of everything:  burgers, pastas, sandwiches, ethnic foods, etc.  I think I may be back in the future to explore the menu a little more.  Even our boring and slow waiter didn't ruin my experience.  Nice!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=720,3.56,3.56,3.508,2.9240000000000004,3.5600000000000005

I tasted more of the sour cream. but otherwise still a yummy appetizer. It came with 4 samosas.  The crab cake bites were scrumptious!!! Perfectly fried and paired with a mustard dipping sauce. I would say that the 6 mini bites are equivalent to 1 regular size crab cake.  As far as the side salad goes... there really isn't much to say, beside that the purple cabbage should either be drenched in the vinaigrette or at least be separated so it is able to absorb some more of the dressing as well.  The rib eye was fine. It was cooked a little too well done. We asked for medium. But it was still ok. Nothing to brag about here.

I had called two days prior and asked the receptionist what their slowest day of the week was, so as to avoid the endless stream of Cheesecake Factory patrons. Monday was their slowest day of the week according to the woman on the phone. Monday was my birthday so this worked out perfectly. I show up with a party of four (me included) Monday around 5 pm. I mentioned to the hostess that we would be having four additional guests showing up for dessert only. She was kind enough to give me several seating options. I chose to sit at the tables closest to the bar. Our waitress was decent. She got us started off with the drinks. I ordered the caramel pretzel vodka milkshake. (Had I known that one drink was $10 I would have never ordered it. ALL prices should be listed on Cheesecake Factory's menu, not just some of them!) Sadly the drink was not up to par with its premium pricing. There was more than a pregnant pause between ordering our drinks and ordering our food. I was a little annoyed that ordering took so long, especially because the restaurant seemed very empty. Our orders were placed. Again I felt there was an extraordinarily long wait for our food. We were a party of four, and the restaurant was uncharacteristic of the seemingly always busy Cheesecake Factory I have seen in the past. I do not remember the exact placement of events, but somewhere between ordering our food and getting our food, our initial waitress had left for a lunch break. This is where I felt my visit went downhill. I do not recall the fill-in waitress ever checking on us, nor being present when our food arrived. The food itself was good. Always is. Again I do not remember the exact order of events that took place, but the additional four guests arrived and our original waitress returned from her lunch break. Desert was ordered. Desert was probably the most time consuming part of our visit. It took FOREVER to receive our damn cheesecake! Ironically our waitress seemed annoyed with us, like we had done something wrong! Nothing verbal, just silent body language cues. Desert is finished, and the late four arrivals of our party leave. It is now 8 pm, and I swear 2 of the 3 hours we spent in the factory were dedicated to waiting. We received the check... The waitress charged us an automatic gratuity of 18% for our ""large party.""

Aside from a lacking in service I didn't feel that I needed to pay more for four people who only received dessert.

During lunch time, I usually get the pasta lunch special where you can order a lunch sized portion of their select pasta dishes.  It's cheaper than dinner prices and I've never been able to finish a whole one by myself.  The cream sauce for their pasta dishes is simply divine, so whenver I go, I ALWAYS order the Fettucine Alfredo or the Pasta Carbonara.  What's really awesome about it is that I can change the type of pasta used int he dish.  The Pasta Carbonara is supposed to come with Spaghettini, but I prefer Penne pasta.  They change it, no problem, and there isn't any extra charge!  When I go for dinner, I usually order the same thing as lunch.  What can I say, I'm a creature of habit. The only difference, I've just started ordering cheesecake for dessert.  My preference, the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake.  Oh.  Em. Gee!!!  AMAZING!! It's sweet, chocolatey goodness in my mouth!

What I like most about The CF is that the place is huge and spacious.  The menu is another plus because literally anyone could find something on the menu to their liking.  They have a bit of everything:  burgers, pastas, sandwiches, ethnic foods, etc.  I think I may be back in the future to explore the menu a little more.  Even our boring and slow waiter didn't ruin my experience.  Nice!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=720,3.8,3.56,3.512,3.0520000000000005,3.656

1937,Kathleen F.,"Beaverton, United States",34,49,,4.0,2013-02-06,"I am never disappointed with the good ole' Cheesecake Factory! I have never had a dish I didn't love to pieces. My Favorites are the Mac 'n' Cheese Burger and the Chicken Chipotle Pasta. Off all the chain restaurants, they have the best waitresses (Who actually know the menu) and alcoholic beverages(I would rather come here and pay $12 for a fantastic Pina Colada than crappy Apple Bees). Desserts are of epic proportions, I have had their cheesecake(original and dulce de leche) and the Godiva Chocolate Brownie(Wonderful!). The Cons: Price and Waiting time I think anytime you go to the Cheesecake factory on the weekends or special holiday, you are going to have to wait.........there is no way of getting around it, its how the cookie crumbles. I have never had their brunch but I wouldn't even attempt to go wait for it(the wait is pretty long on sunday mornings). Its no better at the Roseville locations either, so dont even attempt to drive the extra 15 minutes to think it will be ""faster""....because it won't. The price is pretty outrageous, for 3 adults to eat, this includes :one appetizer, 3 entrees, 3 standard beverages, 3 desserts and tip will run about $110. Add in alcoholic beverages, you are looking close to $140! BUT, If you are anything like me and only eat out a couple times a year, you want quality food that is going to satisfy you and this place hits the spot. I have never left here feeling like I threw away money like at other major chain restaurants, because of the quality your are getting....nothing beats it. If you have never been here you are missing out....get yourself over and try their cheesecake....IT FLIPPING AWESOME!!!

We order: *Strawberry Cheesecake * Red Velvet Cheesecake **Chicken Samosas *Appetizer Caesar Salad (that was more than enough for two maybe even three people to share) *A Mint Mojito *And a Passion Mojito (SUPER DELICIOUS) All that for $57 bucks NOT BAD AT ALL AND VERY FILLING!  Now lets discuss how Luis put a damper on the evening, the ONLY reason I gave 3 stars was I normally receive GREAT service, my company and the food we ate was great HOWEVER the overall dining experience was definitely dampened by our server.  THE CONS: Our server was an IDIOT and COMPLETELY inattentive to our table! I guess I wouldn't be as irritated if he didn't ensure he checked on the needs of the not one but two birthday table full of of ladies... guess what creeper you're loosing out on this table's tip!  Speaking of birthday, I asked before we even received our menus that they come over and sing happy birthday to my friend and THAT never happened but the perv sure made sure the table of ladies was taken care of with their birthday song. Ugh RUDE! Whats worst. He bought our cheesecake and left for five minutes..... Anyone want to guess what critical piece he left off.... go ahead I'll wait....that's right he FINALLY came back and asked how everything was and if we needed anything um yea dummy, something TO EAT MY $10 cheesecake with! -_- To which he responded oh I'm so sorry! (IDIOT) after which he began reaching over my date and I to clear our half drank cocktails an the rest of my samosas umm WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING BRO!?! 1) I'm not done with my drink and 2) I'm TOTALLY eating my somosa's in the morning BYE BYE! I kindly told him I was still eating THANKS and continued about my evening. After bring the bill and the to go boxes I KID YOU not my date barely got his cheesecake onto the plate and was seconds away from scooping his dollop of whip cream into his box when this tad grabbed his plate by then I was SO frustrated that I spoke up and let him know WHOA still boxing. That action solidified in my mind he was going to get not ONE cent over the bill!

Since our group was large, we had 2 servers.  They were both friendly and attentive.  Prior to ordering, they asked if we would all like separate bills, which is a plus.  They kept all of our waters filled throughout the night and did a good job remembering who ordered what even though a few of us changed our seats.  Large groups can get annoying, especially when they start moving around or getting out of their seats (which we did) but the servers kept a smile on their face and made us feel very comfortable and welcome.

Since we wanted to enjoy the celebration we decided to order the appetizers first, and our main meal after we finished the appetizers. We started off with the calamari and nachos with chicken. The portion sizes here are huge...the calamari was well seasoned and fried, the nachos had large scoops of sour cream, guacomole, salsa, and covered with melted cheese....very good way to start the meal. For dinner, the table ordered the farfalle chicken pasta, grilled rib eye, bbq ranch chicken salad, and the herb crusted salmon....we did it family style so everyone had a little bit of everything.

And now that it's in the rear view, never to be an issue again, a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders, I've cleared my mind, my soul, and have never been more focused and happy moving on.  Ok, let's talk about the drinks!  San Pellagrino water to start while the bartender concocted my Macallan 12 on the rocks (shame most establishments don't stock on 18/25+, but I understand... $$$).  I usually have it neat but it was already warm there in a packed bar/house.  And so as the condensation wrapped around my ice cold glass, I took a whiff of that sweet, oak, sherry filled aroma only my whiskey can give me.  And once it hit my lips, the sweet burn from the aged single-malt, to the smooth finish rolling from my tongue down my throat, coating it with the finest blend of alcohol known to man... in that moment, in that warm feeling, I knew it was going to be just fine the rest of the night.  And so were the next three rounds.   Alas, feeling warm, comfortable, and now satisfied from completing my mission, ""Mission unfinished business"", I left satisfied, content, and ready to a little tipsy, hehe.  It was the perfect setting to close out that chapter of my life, and as I walked out the doors to see the glowing lights of The Cheesecake Factory, I also walked into a new life full of happiness and mental focus that no one can break.  Thanks again for a splendid time TCF, was very happy to be back in the 916.

Well now I can brag to them that I finally did!  I decided to come to this place for my first time for my 22nd birthday dinner on a Friday night. 4 of my friends and I came here around 6:30pm (sad we missed the Happy Hour 4-6pm) and it was packed, but luckily we were able to get a booth in like 10-15 minutes.  I asked my friends what was good here and I read the reviews of this place and everyone talks about their cheesecake; specifically their Red Velvet cheesecake so I knew I had to get that for dessert.  Started off with the unlimited bread! I love love their brown bread (had a sweet taste to it) I ended up ordering the Avocado Eggrolls for appetizers and shared it with my friends; we all loved it! For my entree I got the Factory Combination (Steak and Salmon) and it was served with mashed potatoes and asparagus. I really enjoyed the steak (marinated in a sauce with mushrooms too) and the mashed potatoes (I'm a big fan of mashed potatoes) and the salmon and asparagus was alright. Steak was the right texture, not too tough and the mashed potatoes were creamy. My friend recommended me to get the Factory Peach Bellini (not a strong drink but a very fruity/girly drink) and I enjoyed it! And of course for dessert, I had a Red Velvet Cheesecake and the staff sang me Happy Birthday as well. Everyone was right, their Red Velvet Cheesecake is the bomb! A few of my friends also bought the Dulce de leche Cheesecake for TOGO and all I can say is that it was also very delicious as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=340,4.16,3.7,3.568,3.568,3.8840000000000003

2107,Katie G.,"Sacramento, United States",3,23,2.0,4.0,2013-05-10,"I live right near this Cheesecake Factory, so  I come here relatively often with my boyfriend. Even when it's busy, the two of us don't have problems just walking in and sitting at the bar. I think that one time we gad to wait for a table or seats in the bar area for maybe 10 minutes.  My boyfriend always gets the chicken enchiladas and they are delicious. Not the most authentic enchilada, but still good nonetheless.  I usually try to get two of the small plates so I can have a little variety. I really enjoy all of the flatbreads they have there. I think my favorite is probably the pear and blue cheese one. It is a little sweeter than I would have expected but was still very good.  The ahi tartare is amazing. I was surprised at the quality of the ahi in there because this is a chain restaurant. But it did taste very fresh and the avocado and sauce that come with it are perfect.  I had the endive salad, but it wasn't my favorite. The lettuce has a very string flavor, which I wasn't really prepared for. The dressing was just alright. Nothing special.  The arugula salad was pretty good. I really like that instead of dressing they just put olive oil and lemon on the salad. The last time I ordered this though, there was wayyyy too much lemon juice and it was nearly in edible. I'll likely request for light lemon juice next time to avoid this.  The grilled artichokes are delicious. They come with two dips and one if them is a vinaigrette that is surprisingly well matched with the artichoke. I'm definitely getting this every time I go here now.  The crispy crab bites and the crab cakes are both delicious! They are also very rich and I could only eat one. I would only get these if there were a group of people to eat them.  The Carlton salad is pretty good. I really like salads with dried fruit and candied nuts, but since I had this there I've had a number of better salads like this. I would pass on this in favor of something else.   The lemon raspberry cheesecake is the greatest. It's the only cheesecake I ever get here. Amazing! The service here is always consistent. The servers are very nice and attentive. Sitting at the bar, I've noticed that service is a little slower, but I don't mind it.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=800,4.04,3.89,3.632,3.8240000000000003,3.95

775,Kathleen F.,"Beaverton, OR",34,49,,4.0,2013-06-02,"I am never disappointed with the good ole' Cheesecake Factory! I have never had a dish I didn't love to pieces. My Favorites are the Mac 'n' Cheese Burger and the Chicken Chipotle Pasta. Off all the chain restaurants, they have the best waitresses (Who actually know the menu) and alcoholic beverages(I would rather come here and pay $12 for a fantastic Pina Colada than crappy Apple Bees). Desserts are of epic proportions, I have had their cheesecake(original and dulce de leche) and the Godiva Chocolate Brownie(Wonderful!). The Cons: Price and Waiting time I think anytime you go to the Cheesecake factory on the weekends or special holiday, you are going to have to wait.........there is no way of getting around it, its how the cookie crumbles. I have never had their brunch but I wouldn't even attempt to go wait for it(the wait is pretty long on sunday mornings). Its no better at the Roseville locations either, so dont even attempt to drive the extra 15 minutes to think it will be ""faster""....because it won't. The price is pretty outrageous, for 3 adults to eat, this includes :one appetizer, 3 entrees, 3 standard beverages, 3 desserts and tip will run about $110. Add in alcoholic beverages, you are looking close to $140! BUT, If you are anything like me and only eat out a couple times a year, you want quality food that is going to satisfy you and this place hits the spot. I have never left here feeling like I threw away money like at other major chain restaurants, because of the quality your are getting....nothing beats it. If you have never been here you are missing out....get yourself over and try their cheesecake....IT FLIPPING AWESOME!!! I would give 5 star but I had to take one off for the wait time :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=760,4.28,3.98,3.692,3.472,4.1000000000000005

1777,Steve M.,"Sacramento, United States",154,241,6.0,3.0,2013-06-11,"We received a great gift from my brother of a dinner and a movie.  The dinner was for The Cheesecake Factory, so off we went.  We were both very pleased with our meal, first the menu is just as huge as I remember, so many things to choose from is one of the biggest challenges you will face here.  Ultimately, I decided on a Chile Relleno burger (something I have never even considered before), and my wife had the fish tacos.  We also had a couple of small plate appetizers consisting of the Bang Shrimp  and the fried polenta sticks.   The bang shrimp was GREAT (highlight of the night) and the dipping sauce was excellent too.  The Polenta sticks were good - but different.  They reminded me of a limp mozzarella cheese stick.  When our entree's arrived we were half full form the small plates but were ready to go.  My wife's tacos were good, and with four tacos, she only finished half.  I loved her beans and rice but she didn't care for the rice as it had a lot of Cilantro (not her fav but one of mine).  My Chile Relleno burger was interesting.  The Chile Relleno gave it a slightly odd texture, but the taste and flavor was good.  Cooked to a perfect medium well just like I ordered. We had good service considering it was a busy Friday night.  We would go back again, but probably only with a gift card or coupon - there are many more places we have never been that we are anxious to explore.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=620,4.2,4.02,3.708,3.404,4.0920000000000005

Since our group was large, we had 2 servers.  They were both friendly and attentive.  Prior to ordering, they asked if we would all like separate bills, which is a plus.  They kept all of our waters filled throughout the night and did a good job remembering who ordered what even though a few of us changed our seats.  Large groups can get annoying, especially when they start moving around or getting out of their seats (which we did) but the servers kept a smile on their face and made us feel very comfortable and welcome.

The restaurant hadn't filled up with a dinner rush yet and my friend and I decided to sit at the bar for drinks and happy hour food. Don was our bartender and I'm so happy he was. He made sure to ask us exactly how we wanted our martinis prepared, which I appreciated. There aren't a whole lot of ways to mess up a martini but there are many ways to make one better by personalization. And he did. My friend and I shared the white bean hummus and a chopped salad. Both amazing! And it wasn't a problem when we asked for share plates, more bread, or fresh ground pepper. The prices weren't cheap but the portions were hefty and everything was very very tasty. Don was on his game. Also a pleasant guy to chat with. It's uncomfortable when bartenders never speak a word to you - We know you can hear our entire conversation so please don't pretend otherwise. Conversely I dislike when bartenders talk too much - as nice as we're all being to each other, you aren't the person I came to have a drink with. Don had the right balance of friendly attentiveness. He also seemed experienced and to genuinely like his job. Whether that's actually the case doesn't make a difference.

805,Katie G.,"Sacramento, CA",3,23,2.0,4.0,2013-10-05,"I live right near this Cheesecake Factory, so  I come here relatively often with my boyfriend. Even when it's busy, the two of us don't have problems just walking in and sitting at the bar. I think that one time we gad to wait for a table or seats in the bar area for maybe 10 minutes.  My boyfriend always gets the chicken enchiladas and they are delicious. Not the most authentic enchilada, but still good nonetheless.  I usually try to get two of the small plates so I can have a little variety. I really enjoy all of the flatbreads they have there. I think my favorite is probably the pear and blue cheese one. It is a little sweeter than I would have expected but was still very good.  The ahi tartare is amazing. I was surprised at the quality of the ahi in there because this is a chain restaurant. But it did taste very fresh and the avocado and sauce that come with it are perfect.  I had the endive salad, but it wasn't my favorite. The lettuce has a very string flavor, which I wasn't really prepared for. The dressing was just alright. Nothing special.  The arugula salad was pretty good. I really like that instead of dressing they just put olive oil and lemon on the salad. The last time I ordered this though, there was wayyyy too much lemon juice and it was nearly in edible. I'll likely request for light lemon juice next time to avoid this.  The grilled artichokes are delicious. They come with two dips and one if them is a vinaigrette that is surprisingly well matched with the artichoke. I'm definitely getting this every time I go here now.  The crispy crab bites and the crab cakes are both delicious! They are also very rich and I could only eat one. I would only get these if there were a group of people to eat them.  The Carlton salad is pretty good. I really like salads with dried fruit and candied nuts, but since I had this there I've had a number of better salads like this. I would pass on this in favor of something else.   The lemon raspberry cheesecake is the greatest. It's the only cheesecake I ever get here. Amazing! The service here is always consistent. The servers are very nice and attentive. Sitting at the bar, I've noticed that service is a little slower, but I don't mind it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=800,3.64,3.97,3.756,3.504,3.8380000000000005

Is what all my friends ask me when I tell them that I've never been to this place before. Well now I can brag to them that I finally did!  I decided to come to this place for my first time for my 22nd birthday dinner on a Friday night. 4 of my friends and I came here around 6:30pm (sad we missed the Happy Hour 4-6pm) and it was packed, but luckily we were able to get a booth in like 10-15 minutes.  I asked my friends what was good here and I read the reviews of this place and everyone talks about their cheesecake; specifically their Red Velvet cheesecake so I knew I had to get that for dessert.  Started off with the unlimited bread! I love love their brown bread (had a sweet taste to it) I ended up ordering the Avocado Eggrolls for appetizers and shared it with my friends; we all loved it! For my entree I got the Factory Combination (Steak and Salmon) and it was served with mashed potatoes and asparagus. I really enjoyed the steak (marinated in a sauce with mushrooms too) and the mashed potatoes (I'm a big fan of mashed potatoes) and the salmon and asparagus was alright. Steak was the right texture, not too tough and the mashed potatoes were creamy. My friend recommended me to get the Factory Peach Bellini (not a strong drink but a very fruity/girly drink) and I enjoyed it! And of course for dessert, I had a Red Velvet Cheesecake and the staff sang me Happy Birthday as well. Everyone was right, their Red Velvet Cheesecake is the bomb! A few of my friends also bought the Dulce de leche Cheesecake for TOGO and all I can say is that it was also very delicious as well.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=340,3.84,4.01,3.788,3.2800000000000002,3.942

And now that it's in the rear view, never to be an issue again, a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders, I've cleared my mind, my soul, and have never been more focused and happy moving on.  Ok, let's talk about the drinks!  San Pellagrino water to start while the bartender concocted my Macallan 12 on the rocks (shame most establishments don't stock on 18/25+, but I understand... $$$).  I usually have it neat but it was already warm there in a packed bar/house.  And so as the condensation wrapped around my ice cold glass, I took a whiff of that sweet, oak, sherry filled aroma only my whiskey can give me.  And once it hit my lips, the sweet burn from the aged single-malt, to the smooth finish rolling from my tongue down my throat, coating it with the finest blend of alcohol known to man... in that moment, in that warm feeling, I knew it was going to be just fine the rest of the night.  And so were the next three rounds.   Alas, feeling warm, comfortable, and now satisfied from completing my mission, ""Mission unfinished business"", I left satisfied, content, and ready to a little tipsy, hehe.  It was the perfect setting to close out that chapter of my life, and as I walked out the doors to see the glowing lights of The Cheesecake Factory, I also walked into a new life full of happiness and mental focus that no one can break.  Thanks again for a splendid time TCF, was very happy to be back in the 916.

The restaurant hadn't filled up with a dinner rush yet and my friend and I decided to sit at the bar for drinks and happy hour food. Don was our bartender and I'm so happy he was. He made sure to ask us exactly how we wanted our martinis prepared, which I appreciated. There aren't a whole lot of ways to mess up a martini but there are many ways to make one better by personalization. And he did. My friend and I shared the white bean hummus and a chopped salad. Both amazing! And it wasn't a problem when we asked for share plates, more bread, or fresh ground pepper. The prices weren't cheap but the portions were hefty and everything was very very tasty. Don was on his game. Also a pleasant guy to chat with. It's uncomfortable when bartenders never speak a word to you - We know you can hear our entire conversation so please don't pretend otherwise. Conversely I dislike when bartenders talk too much - as nice as we're all being to each other, you aren't the person I came to have a drink with. Don had the right balance of friendly attentiveness. He also seemed experienced and to genuinely like his job. Whether that's actually the case doesn't make a difference.

Therefore, I wasn't looking forward to dinner again. at this semi-upscale chain restaurant known for their cheesecake and multifaceted American menu. Much to my surprise, I was really impressed with the staffing, timing, and comfortable environs. We were seated quickly, our drinks and orders taken and food on the table, all in under 30 minutes. Prices are reasonable and service was really good. The kitchen did an amazing job with our large party's diverse orders. I loved the classic burger with mesclun salad on the side- a great deal for $10.95.

I called to set up a reservation for 12 people and was told to come in 15 minutes before the time we wanted to eat (which was 6) to put our name in. I thought only 15 minutes was a stretch for 12 people so I went in a full hour early. When I went in at 5, they then told me it would be two hours before we could be seated. I called everyone else in my party and told them to come at 630. By 6 I went to check on our progress and was told we would be seated by 615, a time when none of our party would be there. I called everyone again and told them to hurry. We didn't get seated until 8 o'clock!!!!!! I was there for three hours, they changed their story multiple times, our party ended up being split into 3 groups so we could eat. It was also a group of mainly elderly relatives that all wanted to go out and have dinner together because we had been to my grandpas funeral earlier that day. Two were in wheel chairs which was my reason for getting there early to make sure they didn't have to sit around and exhaust themselves waiting. I am so disappointed and disgusting with this restaurant. I will never eat here again. They have us a free appetizer which was ridiculous compared to the BS we had to deal with. Plus they messed up our food orders. It would have been nice if they were honest with me in the first place when I called and told me this would be difficult for them to accommodate and not until much later in the evening at that.

For how surprisingly busy it was at 2pm, we were seated at a booth very quickly, but it only went downhill from there. Once our waiter took our orders, it was almost an hour of sitting there without ANY food before he came to tell us that the kitchen overcooked my boyfriend's burger and had to redo it. He offered us soup or salad while we were waiting, but didn't mention it if was complementary or not...so we declined. Once our food finally came, we practically inhaled it because we had been waiting so long. We were reluctant to stay longer, but the reason we had come in the first place was to redeem free cheesecake slices, so we ordered a slice of pineapple upside down cheesecake. Even that took a while to come, considering how the front cheesecake counter has slices on plates ready to go for the waiters. Once that plate was cleared, we waited for our check. And waited. Our waiter was nowhere in sight, not even at his other tables nearby. Finally, I flagged him down and asked for the check. After TWO hours at The Cheesecake Factory, when all we had wanted was a simple late lunch/linner, we were more than ready to leave. The saving grace of this experience was the cheesecake.

329,Brittney K.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",380,163,1299.0,2.0,2014-03-24,"Not sure if our waiter was new or what, but the service was especially disappointing. For how surprisingly busy it was at 2pm, we were seated at a booth very quickly, but it only went downhill from there. Once our waiter took our orders, it was almost an hour of sitting there without ANY food before he came to tell us that the kitchen overcooked my boyfriend's burger and had to redo it. He offered us soup or salad while we were waiting, but didn't mention it if was complementary or not...so we declined. Once our food finally came, we practically inhaled it because we had been waiting so long. We were reluctant to stay longer, but the reason we had come in the first place was to redeem free cheesecake slices, so we ordered a slice of pineapple upside down cheesecake. Even that took a while to come, considering how the front cheesecake counter has slices on plates ready to go for the waiters. Once that plate was cleared, we waited for our check. And waited. Our waiter was nowhere in sight, not even at his other tables nearby. Finally, I flagged him down and asked for the check. After TWO hours at The Cheesecake Factory, when all we had wanted was a simple late lunch/linner, we were more than ready to leave. The saving grace of this experience was the cheesecake.

Our party of 7 had a wonderful time with no complaints whatsoever . The staff was very helpful from taking our picture to expediting my margarita . Of course it is 'a' large chain type of restaurant but they are sure doing something right and I am sometimes amazed when things are so well executed . When I have the time I like to check the menu before arriving just to get an idea of what they serve , but did not get a chance to do that on this visit as our first destation was closed [the menu is extensive but needed (?) at a place like this] - food 5* - service 5* - cleanliness 5* - value (someone grabbed the check before I could but the prices on the menu seemed reasonable for what your getting) 5* - intangible / vibe / over all feel 5*  average (hold on let me figure this) 5*",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=560,3.92,3.49,3.788,3.572,3.6620000000000004

Their menu is really big and has lots of choices. It took me a while to order.... The waiter was nice about it or at least looked like he was. I ordered a burger and from the menu it sounded good.. But it turned out to be very dry.. The food here is NOT worth the wait!!! It was my cousins birthday so we told the waiter after we ordered. Hoping he would bring a desert after dinner. Not only did he forget... But it was not complimentary. It was 8$ for a cheesecake. Jeez...  Nice place to go if you want to be fancy but not really worth it.

Lunch and dinner comes with free sour dough and wheat (or is it rye) bread. I like the wheat one a lot! It's soft and a little sweet; it tastes well with the melted butter.   My bf and I were just there for lunch. We shared a regular sized sun dried tomato and chicken fettuccine. It will full you up! It's creamy and a bit tangy from the tomatoes. It's good, but not special. But how special can pasta get?  I generally order a slice of Godiva cheesecake, one of the best cheesecakes I have eaten so far. I love dark chocolate, so the degree of bitterness is great for me. I remember the first time I had it, right after I swallow that first bite, I felt a cool feeling in my mouth. It is a must try!  So I decided to try something different, the Reese's cake cheesecake. It was too sweet for me, but it would be good for someone who loves milk chocolate and peanut butter. For me, the cake layer took up too much space compared to the cheesecake layer. It was too rich and too high in calories for me to eat it all at once, so as usual, I finished it in 2 days (with my bf's help)!

Lunch and dinner comes with free sour dough and wheat (or is it rye) bread. I like the wheat one a lot! It's soft and a little sweet; it tastes well with the melted butter.   My bf and I were just there for lunch. We shared a regular sized sun dried tomato and chicken fettuccine. It will full you up! It's creamy and a bit tangy from the tomatoes. It's good, but not special. But how special can pasta get?  I generally order a slice of Godiva cheesecake, one of the best cheesecakes I have eaten so far. I love dark chocolate, so the degree of bitterness is great for me. I remember the first time I had it, right after I swallow that first bite, I felt a cool feeling in my mouth. It is a must try!  So I decided to try something different, the Reese's cake cheesecake. It was too sweet for me, but it would be good for someone who loves milk chocolate and peanut butter. For me, the cake layer took up too much space compared to the cheesecake layer. It was too rich and too high in calories for me to eat it all at once, so as usual, I finished it in 2 days (with my bf's help)!

We ordered mostly appetizers in order to have multiple tastings, and each dish was spectacular.  None of the dishes we ordered lacked in taste and flavor.  5 Stars!!! Fire Roasted Chile Relleno:  Extra Yumm-O!  This was my favorite dish of the night.  I love Chile Rellenos which I order frequently when I go to a Mexican restaurant, but the dish at Cheesecake Factory was heightened to another level and one of the best I have tasted.  It was crispy and flavorful.  There was also a hint of mild heat which I enjoy.  Fried Macaroni and Cheese:  I'm not a fan of Mac & Cheese, but these fried cheese balls were filled with perfectly cooked pasta and cheesy deliciousness. Roasted Pear and Blue Cheese:  Sweet and tangy flavor over a thin crust of crispy flat bread. Crispy Crab Bites:  Yumm-O!  What can I say? Mahi Mahi & Shrimp Vera Cruz:  My friend ordered an entree from the SkinnyLicious Menu.  The fish and shrimp were perfectly cooked, and the flavor profile for the entire dish was superb.  Perfect dish as an appetizer for two if you're sharing. Aside from the food, it was amazing to watch how the employees were coordinating with each other to get a table set up for the next customer.  Efficient and flawless!  Take time to observe these worker bees in action if you have not already because they work hard to make our experience pleasant.  Way to go, Cheesecake Factory!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=380,3.84,3.72,3.708,3.0600000000000005,3.7680000000000002

Firstly, their soda mix was off, so the soda was flat and syrup-y, which as a person who enjoys soda, I found very annoying. I politely informed the waitress, but she did not seem to care. Secondly, the person who brought out the food, likely a manager of some sort, asked if I wanted ketchup and then brought some. It reminded me of the awful ketchup I had in middle school when the school tried to save money by buying canned generic ketchup and adding water to it.

The louisiana is creamy but has a little kick of spice in it topped chicken that's crispy till you get full and leave it in the fridge for the next day.  Leftovers aren't bad though folks. AND WHEN I'M FEELIN REAL FANCY, I get the key lime cheesecake after.

I called to set up a reservation for 12 people and was told to come in 15 minutes before the time we wanted to eat (which was 6) to put our name in. I thought only 15 minutes was a stretch for 12 people so I went in a full hour early. When I went in at 5, they then told me it would be two hours before we could be seated. I called everyone else in my party and told them to come at 630. By 6 I went to check on our progress and was told we would be seated by 615, a time when none of our party would be there. I called everyone again and told them to hurry. We didn't get seated until 8 o'clock!!!!!! I was there for three hours, they changed their story multiple times, our party ended up being split into 3 groups so we could eat. It was also a group of mainly elderly relatives that all wanted to go out and have dinner together because we had been to my grandpas funeral earlier that day. Two were in wheel chairs which was my reason for getting there early to make sure they didn't have to sit around and exhaust themselves waiting. I am so disappointed and disgusting with this restaurant. I will never eat here again. They have us a free appetizer which was ridiculous compared to the BS we had to deal with. Plus they messed up our food orders. It would have been nice if they were honest with me in the first place when I called and told me this would be difficult for them to accommodate and not until much later in the evening at that.

If you want to try a host of great food before you skip to dessert, come here. If you're looking for neither, still come here. You will become a believer. As soon as you walk in the door, you'll notice the tidy and inviting atmosphere, as well as the fresh display of almost every cheesecake they have to your left. Once you see those, you know you're coming back. Maybe not tomorrow or next week, as you'll need to recuperate, but face it: you're coming back. The restaurant always looks great. Its colors are relaxing and eye-pleasing, the buidling itself is spacious, and has outdoor and bar seating. The bathroom usually doesn't reek of urine, which is one of the highest forms of compliment I can give to a public restroom. When you sit down to order, they will offer you sweet wheat bread, and either white or sourdough along with butter. And no, you don't get to choose between white and sourdough; I was just too busy stuffing my face with wheat to recall which one it was! The food gets better every time I order. My favorite item on the menu by far is Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp for three words: sweet, spicy Thai. I had to stop myself from ordering it the last few visits so that I could experience a spot of the rest of the huge menu. This is a real item, I kid you not: a burger with topped with fried macaroni and cheese, smothered in more cheese. Need I say that I was scarfing it down during a conversation with abandon? Fish and chips come with huge portions of fish, fries (substitutable for sweet potato), and cole slaw. Everything is huge. For health buffs, you may want the alternate menu, as hardly anything runs under quadruple digits for calories. The cheesecake is served in either large, thick slices for around 7.50 or one of two full cake sizes for special occasions (the larger ones go for 50). Allow me to list off the ones you'll probably want: the large, multi-layered Ultimate Red Velvet, the caramel-covered White Chocolate Macadamia with its sweet cookie-tasting crust, the seasonal flavors, Peppermint and Pumpkin, and the legions of chocolate-based flavors, including Snickers, Reese's, Godiva, mousse, and 30th anniversary cake. That is hardly a third of them. I plan to try them all in years to come. They also have traditional desserts on their menu, which is cute. I may try them someday. The only slight I have against this restaurant is this one server who was visibly and audibly anxious about me ordering several slices of cheesecake to go. It was very rude.

They are not TGIF but they also are not that 5-star 2 month wait on reservations establishment.  Yes the menu can be overwhelming. Goodness gracious it's a novel. But they do capture something for everyone...from appetizers to entrees to delectable desserts and of course the best cheesecakes in the Western Hemisphere. The place can be cheesy (no pun intended), but it is a place where all walks of life can meet at neutral ground. While meeting at neutral they can enjoy great food, great drinks and yes again the best cheesecakes around.  The miso salmon, wasabi tuna, and the jambalaya pasta are killer. I try to stay away from this trifecta of deliciousness but I just can't. For the cheesecakes, just try them all. My favorite is the Dutch Apple and the pineapple upside down.

I asked the waitress if I could get a new slice of cheesecake on a new dish. At first, she only returned with a new dish of whipped cream, I asked if I could get, yet again , a new slice of cheesecake given that the original slice had the nestled up against the soiled dish in the first place. As if my order was so complicated, she finally took the original slice of cheesecake back, only to return with that same slice of cheesecake but now on a different plate. Frustrated, I told the waitress that this was the same slice of cheesecake she told me no it was not. Unbenounced to her I had created a dent in the same slice of cheesecake with my fork to see if they would actually give me the same slice of cheesecake prior. Nonetheless I sent it all back .

Our server, Costas, was super friendly, helpful, patient, and had an all-around genuine and positive attitude. The service he provided was fantastic, definitely one of the best service experiences I've had.  The Cheesecake Factory now has a new superfoods menu! Perfect, since healthy eating has been making trends lately and people are more conscious of the foods they are eating. I ordered the almond-crusted salmon salad - pan seared salmon over a salad of kale, brussel sprouts, arugula, avocado, quinoa, cranberries, radishes, and vinaigrette dressing. The salmon was very tender and delicious. The kitchen forget to include the avocado, but our server brought some on the side. Apparently the new menu has only been out for a week so the kitchen was not super familiar with it yet.  I guess after eating a super good food, it's time to eat the super bad food...yet also super good in its own way. The Oreo cheesecake...aka Oreo Dream Extreme is my favorite and I just cannot order any other! Although many other flavors taste good, no other can match the rich, decadent, awesomeness of the Oreo cheesecake. I've been to Cheesecake Factory at least 3 times this year and probably 5 times within the last couple years and each time I've ordered the Oreo cheesecake. I've have tried the tiramisu, s'mores, and chocolate cheesecake, which are all good, but still love the Oreo best. In previous visits, I've had the herb crusted salmon, chicken marsala pasta, and a cheeseburger. The herb salmon was really tender and perfect, the chicken marsala pasta was flavorful and delicious, but the burger was not good.

401,Steph M.,"Sacramento, CA",735,253,2306.0,3.0,2015-02-07,"Mediocre and OVERPRICED American food. Ordered the spaghetti with meatballs tonight and it was $14.95... not sure how a simple dish like that could cost so much! The portion wasn't even big enough to share (three meatballs and a bit of noodles in a NON-MEAT based marinara sauce...) and now I'm regretting not ordering their Kobe burger, also around $15 but probably more satisfying! Their spaghetti was sweet and the sausage meatballs were OK, but it wasn't anything spectacular. They DO have a ""Skinnylicious"" menu which offers healthy alternatives of their entrees (500 or fewer calories) but, in my opinion, all they do is cut portion sizes in half and charge a dollar or two less than what the original item costs--NOT WORTH IT! The free bread they give out is always GOOD (especially their brown bread)... just refrain from peeking at the nutritional facts! :P For actual FOOD, I'd rate them a 2/5--I've never been ""WOW'ed"" by their entrees/appetizers/brunch specials.  I would recommend ONLY coming here for dessert!! Their cheesecakes are DELICIOUS and they have so many to choose from you're bound to find something you like! They even offer non-cheesecake items including; tiramisu, carrot cake, warm apple crisp, Linda's fudge cake, black-out cake, chocolate tower truffle cake, strawberry shortcake, and lemoncello cream tortes. My favorite cheesecakes are the 30th Anniversary chocolate cake (original cheesecake, fudge cake, and chocolate truffle cream), white chocolate raspberry truffle, fresh banana cream cheesecake (banana cheesecake topped with bavarian cream and freshly slices bananas), their original cheesecake with strawberry toppings, and their dutch apple caramel streusel (their original cheesecake, baked apples, and a caramel and brown sugar walnut streusel). I've tried their low-carb original cheesecake with strawberries which is sweetened with Splenda and, in my opinion, if you're going to indulge in cheesecake you might as well stick to the ORIGINAL! Cheat meals are OK every once in a while anyways so treat yourself! :)  For cheesecakes I'd rate them a 4/5.   Our waiter, Andrew, was really nice and gave good suggestions on what cheesecakes to order. He was attentive without coming off as being annoying. The service here is always pretty good! (5/5). I'd rate the overall cleanliness of the restaurant a 4/5, their lighting is so dim it's hard to tell what's clean and what isn't. The restaurant itself is very modern and nice for date nights when you're looking to go somewhere slightly upscale and ""safe.""

At first, she only returned with a new dish of whipped cream, I asked if I could get, yet again , a new slice of cheesecake given that the original slice had the nestled up against the soiled dish in the first place. As if my order was so complicated, she finally took the original slice of cheesecake back, only to return with that same slice of cheesecake but now on a different plate. Frustrated, I told the waitress that this was the same slice of cheesecake she told me no it was not.

Me and girlfriend went on a Saturday afternoon and boy was it packed. Also a 30 minute wait just for us two. This place doesn't have pagers, they text you when your table is ready. So we wait and eventually get a table. Our waitress was friendly. The menu is pretty big as it has everything from pizza to pasta and burgers. I decided on the stuffed mushrooms for a snack and my entree the pepperoni pizza. My Gf got a pasta dish that I can't quite remember the name. Everything was good that we ordered. Pizza was a bit on the thin side but they loaded it with lots of cheese :-)  oh and they bring out bread while you wait for your food. Overall a pleasant experience.

The service is good, the menu is huge, and the food always tastes great. I have to say though, I was a bit disappointed today during my visit. Of the many delicious menu items that are served here, there is one entrée in particular that I order just about all of the time. The infamous Grilled Shrimp and Bacon Club Sandwich. This thing is killer. I flipped through the menu today as we sat down for a quick lunch, and I couldn't find the darn thing. So then I asked our server as she was ready to take our order and she gave me the news that I knew I'd be dreading. They no longer serve it. Ouch...heartbreaker. So I guess it's on to the next best thing, their Chicken Madeira. There's not too much to say about it other than the obvious, it's absolutely delicious. Chicken breast draped with cheese and sautéed mushrooms, lounging in a pool of their Madeira wine sauce. It also comes with mashed potatoes and asparagus. What was also cool was that I told our server that my wife and I would be splitting the entrée, so they served it on two separate plates. I know it doesn't sound like a big deal but a lot of restaurants would just bring you an extra plate and have you split it up yourself.

I came around 12ish (and on the day of Easter), so it was pretty crowded. The wait was about 30-40mins. But the good thing is that it's right next to the mall so you can spend your time walking around instead of just sitting there. & they text you when it's time to be seated :)  Okay, enough with that. Let's talk about the food !! ~^___^~ FOOD~~~ 1) Firecracker Salmon --pretty pricey for the amount that you get. ($10.95 for 4 pieces) But delicious. Basically salmon wrapped with egg roll sheets and fried. The salmon inside each did not have a fishy aftertaste, and the sweet sauce at the bottom of the plate completes the overall taste. I don't know if they added the red cabbages just to make it look nice, but I do recommend eating it with the rolls. The cabbage gives that extra crunch that's needed. Plus, the sauce is all over it so it tastes great! 2) Farfalle w/ Chicken and Roasted Garlic --DELICIOUS. It had a smokey taste to it from the bacon bits and the caramelized onions. And the taste of the roasted garlic overwhelms the dish in a good way. The chicken that it comes with was very soft and not chewy at all.  I personally love garlic and onions so this entrée was purrrfect for me. AND who can so no to bacon? 3) Louisiana Chicken Pasta --ALSO DELCIOUS! This dish had a more tangy taste to it with a kick of spice. It tasted like I was in New Orleans! The red and yellow peppers complimented the spices that completed the dish.  Overall, it was a great experience. I'm sad I got so full from the appetizers and pastas because I didn't get to try any of the cheesecakes! & the place is called CHEESECAKE Factory -__-"" but oh wells.

514,Alex T.,"Sacramento, CA",1317,1006,6490.0,4.0,2015-04-09,"i came here on a Tuesday happy hour around 4 pm. i was excited to come here and try out the deep fried mac and cheese balls after the raving from my good friend. when i enter i was sat down in the bar area. i had looked at the happy hour menu and there was a big selection with lots of small bites and drinks available as well. i went ahead and order the deep fried mac and cheese balls and one luncheon special garlic noodles withe chicken. i was glad they offer the luncheon specials til 5pm and happy hour is on too. i also took advantage of the 3 dollar Stella with a slice of orange.  the bread they start you off was wonderful and fluffy warm and fresh. the wheat bread reminded me of black angus bread which i really love because its honey oat wheat bread. crisp and lightly sweet on the outside and fluffy in the inside. and when its warm and fresh outta the over its outstanding with some melted butter on it. lets start with the deep fried mac and cheese. they give you 4 pieces and on the outside it is a breaded bread crumb texture and in the inside as you bite into is creamy melted cheese covered pasta shells. it was amazing with the side or marinara sauce which seems like it was mixed with ranch or something inside the sauce. it paired very well and had all kinds of explosions of texture and flavors in my mouth like it was having a disco party. i rate this dish a 5 outta 5. it was amazing cheesy good!  now time to rate the garlic noodles pasta, it was a very nice and colorful pasta dish. i was offered some fresh Parmesan cheese and of course i will take some. i then tasted the noodles and it was very moist and buttery good. then the next bite was the char grilled chicken which was very flavorful. i almost got tricked that the chicken were boneless and when i bit into it there was a bone, so be careful. overall the dish was missing some black pepper and of course i i wish they had fresh pepper instead of table pepper. also to my thoughts the dish was a bit bland and not garlicky enough for me since i love it garlicky overall the menu says 12,95 but with chicken added to it is 2 dollars extra. overall the price was 14.95 which was on the pricier side.  overall my experience was great.  had a good time and like the vibe as well. the service was great and didn't leave our water empty. i like the big selection of happy hour and regular menu as well. they also serve brunch on Sundays and i am kind of excited to come here and try that out. also a note they don't have bottomless mimosas which was my first question for every brunch spot LOLZ.... but yea not bad prices fro brunch most items were 10 to 12 bucks but most expensive one was 14.95. i will be back for the terramisu cheesecake soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=500,4.12,3.72,3.616,2.8960000000000004,3.8800000000000003

I came around 12ish (and on the day of Easter), so it was pretty crowded. The wait was about 30-40mins. But the good thing is that it's right next to the mall so you can spend your time walking around instead of just sitting there. & they text you when it's time to be seated :)  Okay, enough with that. Let's talk about the food !! ~^___^~ FOOD~~~ 1) Firecracker Salmon --pretty pricey for the amount that you get. ($10.95 for 4 pieces) But delicious. Basically salmon wrapped with egg roll sheets and fried. The salmon inside each did not have a fishy aftertaste, and the sweet sauce at the bottom of the plate completes the overall taste. I don't know if they added the red cabbages just to make it look nice, but I do recommend eating it with the rolls. The cabbage gives that extra crunch that's needed. Plus, the sauce is all over it so it tastes great! 2) Farfalle w/ Chicken and Roasted Garlic --DELICIOUS. It had a smokey taste to it from the bacon bits and the caramelized onions. And the taste of the roasted garlic overwhelms the dish in a good way. The chicken that it comes with was very soft and not chewy at all.  I personally love garlic and onions so this entrée was purrrfect for me. AND who can so no to bacon? 3) Louisiana Chicken Pasta --ALSO DELCIOUS! This dish had a more tangy taste to it with a kick of spice. It tasted like I was in New Orleans! The red and yellow peppers complimented the spices that completed the dish.  Overall, it was a great experience. I'm sad I got so full from the appetizers and pastas because I didn't get to try any of the cheesecakes! & the place is called CHEESECAKE Factory -__-"" but oh wells.

Every Cheesecake Factory I've ever tried is usually just okay. This one was the same. I'm not disappointed because I expected it.

519,Lor G.,"Carmichael, CA",0,42,8.0,2.0,2015-06-11,"I use to come here for their Skinnylicious herb crusted salmon salad served on a bed of baby greens with asparagus, tomato and tossed with their vinaigrette dressing. Today and the time before last, I have been very disappointed in the quality. They use to serve the salad with a freshly cooked salmon fillet. Now they actually state, 'Chilled Salmon' on their menu. Well, you know what that means! Cold salmon that has been sitting in the refrigerator (probably overnight). For $17 I expect fresh cooked salmon.... like right then, when I order it.  Since I have received the chilled salmon twice, I specifically asked the waiter to tell the cook in the back that I would like my salmon freshly prepared and not chilled.           Now my mama didn't raise no dumb bunny, and I know when I've been bamboozled. So, when my salad arrived, the salmon was room temp and dry as a piece of shoe leather. Which tells me that the cook took a piece of salmon out of the refrigerator and put it in the microwave to heat it up. I had to take sips of ice tea just to wash the dry (hard around the edges) Salmon down. I mentioned it to our waiter and he said that he specified ""freshly prepare salmon"" on the ticket and made special mention to the chef.  Chef! Really? There IS a difference between a chef and a short order cook, which I suspect is what the Cheese Cake Factory has cooking the food, back in the kitchen. Seriously, no ""chef"" worth his/her salt would ever let a piece of freshly grilled salmon come to a customer that dried out and tough All it takes is for me to be lied too. Then it leaves a bitter taste in my mouth for all their yummy desserts. Epic fail Cheese Cake Factory! I will certainly NOT be a returning customer.

1127,Dave N.,"Woodbridge, United States",14,66,398.0,3.0,2015-06-12,"I occasionally come here with my lady who's a big fan of this place. When we're hungry, we'll literally drive about an hour to Sacramento just to come here. Imagine driving about an hour out of town only to be met with a 20-40 minute waiting list. I jokingly tell her lets go to Cheesecake Factory when I'm not even hungry. It has gotten to a point where I know in about an hour and a half later before we even get inside and get seated and I know we'll both be hungry at that point. You really have to pick the right days to come in. Clearly Friday nights and Saturdays are going to be busy. Expect a bit of a wait.  Onto the food. This place has so many dishes on the menu it's incredible. If you aren't feeling a burger and fries, they have pizza. If you aren't wanting pizza they have mexican food. If you don't want mexican food they have (list goes on and on here). Dead serious here. The menu can accommodate anyone's pallet. I think the issue is obvious here. With so many dishes on the menu, how do the cooks hone in and specialize on any dishes? From my experience and hearing the opinions of others, they really haven't. The food is certainly average at best. The portion sizes aren't consistent each time I visit.  There have been times where you could tell your food was finished along time ago, but with the amount of tables your waiter or waitress is balancing, they're getting it out to you a few minutes later. This may not necessarily be the truth because this place has staff moving from the kitchen to tables, but it's been too many occasions now where the only thing somewhat warm on my plate is the orange chicken. Imagine being hungry for a couple of hours now, having traveled 48 miles only to be told there's a few people in front of you we'll need you to wait a bit, and then you're served average tasting semi-warm food. This has only been my luck here, as my girl's food always appears to actually be steaming hot.  What I feel this place has going for it is the interior and obviously the cheesecake. Their cheesecake is to die for! If your meal is mediocre, end it with a cheesecake and you'll end up leaving feeling like you at least ate something tasted great. I've yet to comment on the general staff here. They're all very busy (at least the times I've been in). You never just see the staff sitting around and relaxing. They are always moving table to table, and going in and out of the kitchen. I would absolutely love to catch this place on a day and time where they aren't that busy to try to gauge the food and wait time on an average day, but I can't make it out to this location during that day/time.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=200,2.68,3.46,3.52,3.2120000000000006,3.1480000000000006

They DO have a ""Skinnylicious"" menu which offers healthy alternatives of their entrees (500 or fewer calories) but, in my opinion, all they do is cut portion sizes in half and charge a dollar or two less than what the original item costs--NOT WORTH IT! The free bread they give out is always GOOD (especially their brown bread)... just refrain from peeking at the nutritional facts! :P For actual FOOD, I'd rate them a 2/5--I've never been ""WOW'ed"" by their entrees/appetizers/brunch specials.  I would recommend ONLY coming here for dessert!! Their cheesecakes are DELICIOUS and they have so many to choose from you're bound to find something you like! They even offer non-cheesecake items including; tiramisu, carrot cake, warm apple crisp, Linda's fudge cake, black-out cake, chocolate tower truffle cake, strawberry shortcake, and lemoncello cream tortes. My favorite cheesecakes are the 30th Anniversary chocolate cake (original cheesecake, fudge cake, and chocolate truffle cream), white chocolate raspberry truffle, fresh banana cream cheesecake (banana cheesecake topped with bavarian cream and freshly slices bananas), their original cheesecake with strawberry toppings, and their dutch apple caramel streusel (their original cheesecake, baked apples, and a caramel and brown sugar walnut streusel). I've tried their low-carb original cheesecake with strawberries which is sweetened with Splenda and, in my opinion, if you're going to indulge in cheesecake you might as well stick to the ORIGINAL! Cheat meals are OK every once in a while anyways so treat yourself! :)  For cheesecakes I'd rate them a 4/5.   Our waiter, Andrew, was really nice and gave good suggestions on what cheesecakes to order. He was attentive without coming off as being annoying. The service here is always pretty good! (5/5). I'd rate the overall cleanliness of the restaurant a 4/5, their lighting is so dim it's hard to tell what's clean and what isn't. The restaurant itself is very modern and nice for date nights when you're looking to go somewhere slightly upscale and ""safe."" I say ""safe"" because they have a lot of menu items to choose from, anywhere from your typical pizza, pasta, burgers and fries to salmon, salads, and steaks, and portion sizes are usually HUGE so you can always share. Overall, I'd only come back here to PICK-UP cheesecakes versus actually dining in!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=400,3.56,3.46,3.512,2.8920000000000003,3.5000000000000004

Our server, Costas, was super friendly, helpful, patient, and had an all-around genuine and positive attitude. The service he provided was fantastic, definitely one of the best service experiences I've had.  The Cheesecake Factory now has a new superfoods menu! Perfect, since healthy eating has been making trends lately and people are more conscious of the foods they are eating. I ordered the almond-crusted salmon salad - pan seared salmon over a salad of kale, brussel sprouts, arugula, avocado, quinoa, cranberries, radishes, and vinaigrette dressing. The salmon was very tender and delicious. The kitchen forget to include the avocado, but our server brought some on the side. Apparently the new menu has only been out for a week so the kitchen was not super familiar with it yet.  I guess after eating a super good food, it's time to eat the super bad food...yet also super good in its own way. The Oreo cheesecake...aka Oreo Dream Extreme is my favorite and I just cannot order any other! Although many other flavors taste good, no other can match the rich, decadent, awesomeness of the Oreo cheesecake. I've been to Cheesecake Factory at least 3 times this year and probably 5 times within the last couple years and each time I've ordered the Oreo cheesecake. I've have tried the tiramisu, s'mores, and chocolate cheesecake, which are all good, but still love the Oreo best. In previous visits, I've had the herb crusted salmon, chicken marsala pasta, and a cheeseburger. The herb salmon was really tender and perfect, the chicken marsala pasta was flavorful and delicious, but the burger was not good. The burger was dry and plain tasting, definitely not their specialty. Also on the negative side, the prices are a tad bit high and there can be a long wait for a table.

When they came to the table she let me know she didn't want a small sundae, but would prefer a cheesecake. The server said that they couldn't possibly do that because it was against policy. How can you not get cheesecake from the cheesecake factory on your birthday?! I won't be going here again, unless under some other circumstances. The burger was definitely not worth 14 dollars...",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=660,3.52,3.43,3.536,2.9960000000000004,3.466
1646,S R.,"Folsom, United States",3,118,266.0,1.0,2015-08-10,Ordered herb grilled salmon which arrived raw.  According to waiteress it was grilled. No sign of fish having  been grilled. Looked to be marinated fish that was thrown in microwave. If i wanted raw fish i would order sushi. People sitting at the next table told me this is how the salmon always is so they no longer order it with salmon being so expensive. I didn't want to send it back to the kitchen in case they spit init and bring it back to me after reheating it.  ....Do NOT order the SALMON !! ... Service could have been better.

This was because it was nearby and we did have a gift card burning a hole in my wallet. I'm pretty aware they usually open at 1100 AM. Well on Sundays it's 1000 AM. Lucky for us there was no wait and we requested to sit out on the patio. Both my hubby and I thought this was an awesome choice as we like to eat outside and when it's not crazy busy!!! Yes! Our waiter JT was very laid back but attentive as he came back to refill our drinks without us asking. I chose to eat healthy and had skinnylicious salmon. We did receive wheat and sourdough bread. Both were delish as well as my entree of salmon and veggies that consisted of asparagus spears, chopped, crunchy carrots and my fave green beans! All in all everything was yummy and really no complaints! If you haven't ever eaten at Cheesecake Factory their menu is like a book! We have been here several times although it's probably been over five years I think! They even had a special SkinnyLicious menu designed for those who wish to eat an entree lower in calories but yet have delicious tasting meal. Both my hubby and I ordered from this menu and it was amazing! I actually chose not to have dessert here as I had something else in mind! The reason for one star reduction is outside the patio its view is Arden Way and the parking lot. It's not super pretty but it wouldn't keep me from coming back here again as we had great service and wonderful food!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=120,3.12,3.28,3.488,3.6,3.2160000000000006

We must have driven by this place a million times!  My wife and I just happen to be in the area after checking out a food fair at a local Jewish Temple down the street. Coming all the way from Elk Grove, we didn't want to go home right away. The Cheesecake Factory sounded like the perfect place to have breakfast or brunch on this Sunday morning.  We had gotten there around 10:30 this morning. As you enter the restaurant, you'll find comfortable bench seating on your right, and a case full of tempting cheesecakes and desserts on your left. They also have a full service bar. Coming this early in the morning, we were able to find close parking as well as not having to wait to be seated. This place can accommodate a large number of customers. There were tons of tables and chairs and also a large number of booths. A perfect place to bring the family to wine and dine. This was a perfect morning to dine outside. They have a huge outdoor dining area! There must be at least 25 tables out there. They offer so many different items on their menu that the menu comes in a little book. There seems to be something for everyone! Starting with appetizers and salads, pizzas, hamburgers, sandwiches, soups, pasta, fish and seafood, steaks and chops. They also serve eggs and omelettes all day long, and Sunday Brunch until 2:00 pm. It was nice to know that they also offer a large number of Vegan Entrees! Today I ordered out of their ""SKINNYLICIOUS"" Menu. I had their ""Sausage and Ricotta"" baked flatbread.(Sausage and Ricotta Cheese with Fontina, Parmesan and Romano Cheese and Herbs). ""Only 490 Calories! "" The flatbread came out ""Hot"". The crust was just the right thickness. Not to thin but yet not to thick. Does that make any sense ? Oh well! This was one of the best tasting flatbread I had in a while.  My wife also ordered out of their ""SKINNYLICIOUS"" Menu. She  had their grilled salmon with steamed asparagus, carrots, and her favorite green beans. The size of the salmon was not small by no means. I would say it was a 4 to 5 oz piece. Cooked perfectly. The vegetables were cooked just the way she likes. Not over cooked, but still on the crunchy side. All of this under 590 calories ! You got to be kidding! The service today was fantastic. Our waiter JT was  very attentive and very professional. He took our order promptly and made sure our glasses were never empty! I mentioned to my wife how impressed I was with JTs service . We had to pass on dessert today. But we'll make sure we leave room for dessert the next time we come.  We had a wonderful time today! And will surely be back soon!

We must have driven by this place a million times!  My wife and I just happen to be in the area after checking out a food fair at a local Jewish Temple down the street. Coming all the way from Elk Grove, we didn't want to go home right away. The Cheesecake Factory sounded like the perfect place to have breakfast or brunch on this Sunday morning.  We had gotten there around 10:30 this morning. As you enter the restaurant, you'll find comfortable bench seating on your right, and a case full of tempting cheesecakes and desserts on your left. They also have a full service bar. Coming this early in the morning, we were able to find close parking as well as not having to wait to be seated. This place can accommodate a large number of customers. There were tons of tables and chairs and also a large number of booths. A perfect place to bring the family to wine and dine. This was a perfect morning to dine outside. They have a huge outdoor dining area! There must be at least 25 tables out there. They offer so many different items on their menu that the menu comes in a little book. There seems to be something for everyone! Starting with appetizers and salads, pizzas, hamburgers, sandwiches, soups, pasta, fish and seafood, steaks and chops. They also serve eggs and omelettes all day long, and Sunday Brunch until 2:00 pm. It was nice to know that they also offer a large number of Vegan Entrees! Today I ordered out of their ""SKINNYLICIOUS"" Menu. I had their ""Sausage and Ricotta"" baked flatbread.(Sausage and Ricotta Cheese with Fontina, Parmesan and Romano Cheese and Herbs). ""Only 490 Calories! "" The flatbread came out ""Hot"". The crust was just the right thickness. Not to thin but yet not to thick. Does that make any sense ? Oh well! This was one of the best tasting flatbread I had in a while.  My wife also ordered out of their ""SKINNYLICIOUS"" Menu. She  had their grilled salmon with steamed asparagus, carrots, and her favorite green beans. The size of the salmon was not small by no means. I would say it was a 4 to 5 oz piece. Cooked perfectly. The vegetables were cooked just the way she likes. Not over cooked, but still on the crunchy side. All of this under 590 calories ! You got to be kidding! The service today was fantastic. Our waiter JT was  very attentive and very professional. He took our order promptly and made sure our glasses were never empty! I mentioned to my wife how impressed I was with JTs service . We had to pass on dessert today. But we'll make sure we leave room for dessert the next time we come.  We had a wonderful time today! And will surely be back soon!

209,Karen K.,"Elk Grove, CA",1443,1117,18489.0,4.0,2015-08-30,"After passing through the Jewish food festival bc of its crowds and another busy breakfast spot we decided upon  Cheesecake Factory. This was because it was nearby and we did have a gift card burning a hole in my wallet. I'm pretty aware they usually open at 1100 AM. Well on Sundays it's 1000 AM. Lucky for us there was no wait and we requested to sit out on the patio. Both my hubby and I thought this was an awesome choice as we like to eat outside and when it's not crazy busy!!! Yes! Our waiter JT was very laid back but attentive as he came back to refill our drinks without us asking. I chose to eat healthy and had skinnylicious salmon. We did receive wheat and sourdough bread. Both were delish as well as my entree of salmon and veggies that consisted of asparagus spears, chopped, crunchy carrots and my fave green beans! All in all everything was yummy and really no complaints! If you haven't ever eaten at Cheesecake Factory their menu is like a book! We have been here several times although it's probably been over five years I think! They even had a special SkinnyLicious menu designed for those who wish to eat an entree lower in calories but yet have delicious tasting meal. Both my hubby and I ordered from this menu and it was amazing! I actually chose not to have dessert here as I had something else in mind! The reason for one star reduction is outside the patio its view is Arden Way and the parking lot. It's not super pretty but it wouldn't keep me from coming back here again as we had great service and wonderful food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=120,3.24,3.33,3.488,3.472,3.294

287,Rainie A.,"Elk Grove, CA",47,10,10.0,3.0,2015-09-11,"A Thursday night, busy but no wait and plenty of tables open. Our server took forever to come over to take our orders and just as long to drop off our check. He was friendly, but you could tell he was starting to stress out. The bread basket was below average. I'm not fond of the wheat bread. It was a bit sweet and hard. I ordered the sweet tamale as an appetizer, very delicious, but I think it works better without the salsa, sour cream, and avocado since it was sweet. My entree was the chicken madeira. It was tender, topped with asparagus and mushrooms, and the sauce was good. The chicken itself had no flavor. The mashed potatoes were my favorite part. My friend ordered the chicken teriyaki. NEVER order Asian dishes from a non-Asian restaurant. It was almost 20 dollars for a plate of hard white rice and mediocre chicken. The maraschino cherry garnish was definitely interesting to see on the plate.... All in all, not a very good place to eat. Will come again to try something else if I ever feel like overpaying and sitting in a dark, cold room. PS I saw the Eye of Sauron.... Many of them.

Today and the time before last, I have been very disappointed in the quality. They use to serve the salad with a freshly cooked salmon fillet. Now they actually state, 'Chilled Salmon' on their menu. Well, you know what that means! Cold salmon that has been sitting in the refrigerator (probably overnight). For $17 I expect fresh cooked salmon.... like right then, when I order it.  Since I have received the chilled salmon twice, I specifically asked the waiter to tell the cook in the back that I would like my salmon freshly prepared and not chilled.           Now my mama didn't raise no dumb bunny, and I know when I've been bamboozled. So, when my salad arrived, the salmon was room temp and dry as a piece of shoe leather. Which tells me that the cook took a piece of salmon out of the refrigerator and put it in the microwave to heat it up. I had to take sips of ice tea just to wash the dry (hard around the edges) Salmon down. I mentioned it to our waiter and he said that he specified ""freshly prepare salmon"" on the ticket and made special mention to the chef.  Chef! Really? There IS a difference between a chef and a short order cook, which I suspect is what the Cheese Cake Factory has cooking the food, back in the kitchen. Seriously, no ""chef"" worth his/her salt would ever let a piece of freshly grilled salmon come to a customer that dried out and tough All it takes is for me to be lied too. Then it leaves a bitter taste in my mouth for all their yummy desserts. Epic fail Cheese Cake Factory! I will certainly NOT be a returning customer.

I'm not fond of the wheat bread. It was a bit sweet and hard. I ordered the sweet tamale as an appetizer, very delicious, but I think it works better without the salsa, sour cream, and avocado since it was sweet. My entree was the chicken madeira. It was tender, topped with asparagus and mushrooms, and the sauce was good. The chicken itself had no flavor. The mashed potatoes were my favorite part. My friend ordered the chicken teriyaki. NEVER order Asian dishes from a non-Asian restaurant. It was almost 20 dollars for a plate of hard white rice and mediocre chicken. The maraschino cherry garnish was definitely interesting to see on the plate.... All in all, not a very good place to eat.

186,Dave N.,"Woodbridge, CA",14,66,398.0,3.0,2015-12-06,"I occasionally come here with my lady who's a big fan of this place. When we're hungry, we'll literally drive about an hour to Sacramento just to come here. Imagine driving about an hour out of town only to be met with a 20-40 minute waiting list. I jokingly tell her lets go to Cheesecake Factory when I'm not even hungry. It has gotten to a point where I know in about an hour and a half later before we even get inside and get seated and I know we'll both be hungry at that point. You really have to pick the right days to come in. Clearly Friday nights and Saturdays are going to be busy. Expect a bit of a wait.  Onto the food. This place has so many dishes on the menu it's incredible. If you aren't feeling a burger and fries, they have pizza. If you aren't wanting pizza they have mexican food. If you don't want mexican food they have (list goes on and on here). Dead serious here. The menu can accommodate anyone's pallet. I think the issue is obvious here. With so many dishes on the menu, how do the cooks hone in and specialize on any dishes? From my experience and hearing the opinions of others, they really haven't. The food is certainly average at best. The portion sizes aren't consistent each time I visit.  There have been times where you could tell your food was finished along time ago, but with the amount of tables your waiter or waitress is balancing, they're getting it out to you a few minutes later. This may not necessarily be the truth because this place has staff moving from the kitchen to tables, but it's been too many occasions now where the only thing somewhat warm on my plate is the orange chicken. Imagine being hungry for a couple of hours now, having traveled 48 miles only to be told there's a few people in front of you we'll need you to wait a bit, and then you're served average tasting semi-warm food. This has only been my luck here, as my girl's food always appears to actually be steaming hot.  What I feel this place has going for it is the interior and obviously the cheesecake. Their cheesecake is to die for! If your meal is mediocre, end it with a cheesecake and you'll end up leaving feeling like you at least ate something tasted great. I've yet to comment on the general staff here. They're all very busy (at least the times I've been in). You never just see the staff sitting around and relaxing. They are always moving table to table, and going in and out of the kitchen. I would absolutely love to catch this place on a day and time where they aren't that busy to try to gauge the food and wait time on an average day, but I can't make it out to this location during that day/time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=200,2.8,3.21,3.4,2.7640000000000002,3.046

It was super busy people kept bumping into U.S. While we were waiting and we were sat at a tiny 2 top where our conversations were overlapping with the tables on each side of us so we couldn't have any hard core convo.

They don't take reservations and we had a party of eight so there was an expected wait. However, the ""hostess"" was not forthcoming with the time we were to wait. She told me it would be 30 min to 40 minutes. When 40 minutes came and went, I went up to check with her. Rather than apologize for the extended wait, she informed me In a surly tone that we had ""only waited  44 minutes"". I consider this rude and, not in any sense, good customer service. She should have apologized for the extended wait and assured me that we would be seated shortly. NOT IMPRESSIVE and I will not be returning to that restaurant nor the chain any time soon.

Their food is delicious, affordable for the type of restaurant, and there is such a wide range of food options to choose from! In my opinion this is the perfect place for a romantic date night or a celebratory birthday dinner with friends and family!  I mean, you always start off on a good note here when the waiter brings you the delicious soft warm bread that you cannot help but indulge in. To be honest, I go through about 3 of those baskets before my meal even gets to me.  In regards to dishes, you really can't go wrong with any order here but just in case you'd like recommendations, my favorites include: the factory burrito grande and the spicy chipotle chicken pasta. I recently had the egg roll sampler appetizer for the first time and that was delicious too! Ps if you get the factory burrito grande prepare to come VERY HUNGRY! Or you can also take it home and eat it for the next 2 meals. A lot of the dishes are pretty big and I almost always take home leftovers Now comes dessert, because that's obviously the main reason everyone comes here!!! Bring on the cheesecake!!! My favorites are the s'mores cheesecake, the salted caramel cheesecake, and the red velvet one! But truthfully, you really can't go wrong with any of them.

Service- Our server was so polite just a very nice person and so attentive and right on every point! We didn't have to wait for anything he was always right there, if he had to come back he would explain really quick that he would be back in one minute, he was very attentive to all his tables and let me tell you this place was packed wall to wall.

It came out nicely plated, golden brown, crispy, hot, cheese fully melted and served with Marinara Sauce. Very delicious! I want more just thinking about it. Food- I ordered the Grilled Chicken & Avacado Club. All their food was big portions so you won't be leaving there hungry. My Club Sandwich was the best I ever had. Nice juicy grilled chicken breast, bacon, lettuce, tomatoe and avacado on golden brown grilled bread. Oh so good I'm still snacking on the other half.

398,Hi I'm Cameron F.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,,2.0,2016-01-18,"In  my attempt to find a place that was open later on a Sunday and served a wide variety of foods we ended up here.I wanted to go to the Porch,... The Food ar Cheesecake Factory generally consists of frozen and fried.They plate the food for the most part.Frozen,fried foods.There is no ""whole foods"" going on back there.The chef's quickly add on the fresh veggies. We orders several appetizers/small plates. We had an order of Chicken pot stickers,and an order of their spin on a Cubano sandwich,fried and presented  like a spring roll, served with some sort of  mayo dip.We had their Samosas,Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls, and I ordered a Beets with goat cheese salad. We ordered various entrées. I felt bad for my sister in law,eating fish at that place.I would ONLY eat fresh fish.I'm just saying! The issue with the cake and the service! There is no need to say on your birthday,you just want to relax and have a nice evening with your family and friends.You have a  service expectation.When you manage to make everyone  want to leave,that's just not the experience you signed up for. We had a special bithday cake made at a bakery in Oakland,a Tres Leche cake.Nearly any restaurant will charge a fee if you bring outside food or drink. No problem! However,they are still supposed  to serve it to us!  My parents gave the cake with basic instructions,. (Like, please serve this ), and our name on it when we arrived.My family spoke with our waitress as we were seated. I have ate there several times.I have had 2 bad dining experiences there.This was by far the worst of both negative dining experiences there. After dinner,we waited for approximately 30 minutes talking,waiting.I was nervous  they would sing happy birthday to me.No cake came.No waitress.Finally my mom checked,  and they forgot about the cake.They brought the orders of  strawberries we ordered.Some of our party wanted ice cream and she never came back.My father wanted to complain to managment but I just wanted to leave. For nearly a 30 minutes we sat there talking,no one asked if we wanted coffee,or any other dessert items.She did not come to check on us once.We would question if they were get the cake and then that turned into did she forget about the cake.Again,she did not come back to check on us.My mom had to fo find somone. The cake was dropped of at our table.It was not cut, nor did they give us anything to cut the cake with, or clean plates.They should have brought the cake over,on a cake tray, OUT of the box.Or, asked us if they were not sure.An apology for our wait and for their mistake would have been apprexiated.This qualifies for HORRIBLE SERVICE. I will say this,typically their service is better than this.I have had pretty good service.This is my second encounter with a lousy waitress or waiter there,but she was by far the worst.She certainly needs more training,but the manager/supervisor also needs to be aware of what is going on in the restaurant too. The service of the waitress was rude.I noticed it right away She was not friendly,she had an attitude.She dis not check on us.She did not ask us if we wanted more of the bread.She seemed very distracted.Her service not only did not meet my expectations,for my birthday.She managed to upset everyone there,with her rude personality,lack of service as no show, for my cake as we waited. No one ordered drinks of more deserts when they finally appeared.They  just wantes to have the cake and LEAVE.Everyone was angry that she forgot to give us the cake and kept us waiting. Food,frozen and fried.This okay plated frozen foods.There is no ""whole foods"" going on back there. Basically frozen food.The ""chefs"" add on the veggies.Most of the appetizers/small plates  are  frozen/fried. We had an order of chicken pot stickers,and an order of their spin on a Cubano sandwich,fried and presented  like a spring roll, served with a mayo dip.We had their Samosas,Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls, and I ordered a small beets with goat cheese salad.

The cake was dropped of at our table.It was not cut, nor did they give us anything to cut the cake with, or clean plates.They should have brought the cake over,on a cake tray, OUT of the box.Or, asked us if they were not sure.An apology for our wait and for their mistake would have been apprexiated.This qualifies for HORRIBLE SERVICE. I will say this,typically their service is better than this.I have had pretty good service.This is my second encounter with a lousy waitress or waiter there,but she was by far the worst.She certainly needs more training,but the manager/supervisor also needs to be aware of what is going on in the restaurant too. The service of the waitress was rude.I noticed it right away She was not friendly,she had an attitude.She dis not check on us.She did not ask us if we wanted more of the bread.She seemed very distracted.Her service not only did not meet my expectations,for my birthday.She managed to upset everyone there,with her rude personality,lack of service as no show, for my cake as we waited. No one ordered drinks of more deserts when they finally appeared.They  just wantes to have the cake and LEAVE.Everyone was angry that she forgot to give us the cake and kept us waiting. Food,frozen and fried.This okay plated frozen foods.There is no ""whole foods"" going on back there. Basically frozen food.The ""chefs"" add on the veggies.Most of the appetizers/small plates  are  frozen/fried. We had an order of chicken pot stickers,and an order of their spin on a Cubano sandwich,fried and presented  like a spring roll, served with a mayo dip.We had their Samosas,Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls, and I ordered a small beets with goat cheese salad. We ordered various entrées. I felt bad for my sister in law,eating fish at that place.I would ONLY eat fresh fish.I'm just saying.  The food is just not for me. No more Cheesecake Factory.DONE. 2 stars for previous good service,but the stars are also a reflection of terrible service.The service realy matters.It was my birthday.You forgot to bring my cake!

It was super busy people kept bumping into U.S. While we were waiting and we were sat at a tiny 2 top where our conversations were overlapping with the tables on each side of us so we couldn't have any hard core convo.

Had the steak and shrimp last night and it was about as bland and lacking flavor as food can possibly get. Our server was friendly, but the food took forever to come out and then when it was time for dessert it took forever just for the cheesecake to come out as if they were making it to order. The cheesecake is good which is their only saving grace for me because the food is not good at all. Maybe too many menu items (it was difficult to decide from such a large menu) making it difficult to do any one thing really well.

I think it's the variety that does it for me, they do several things well. My go to appetizer is the buffalo blast, Its the perfect mix of fried, chicken, spice, and cheese. Its their take on a buffalo wing and I am in love with it! This was also the first place I ever had fried mac n cheese, and till this day it is my favorite.  For dinner I also have several items I enjoy: kobe burger, cajun pasta, chicken madeira, farfale pasta, and the hibachi steak. During last nights visit I had the kobe burger and it was cooked perfectly, but the fries it came with tasted mediocre at best. I enjoyed a 22oz. Stela with the burger, which was the perfect mix to a long day at work. Thankfully I had a little room in the tank and ordered a chocolate cheesecake. The cake was fresh tasting and did not taste like a store bought cheesecake.  The only reason I can't give this place 5-stars is due to the spotty service. Unfortunately it is never consistent. I have had decent service, but on several occasions I have had poor service. I don't know why but the servers forget about you and aren't prompt majority of the times with requests (bread, extra sauce, utensils). On a side note I would also ask for the brightness of the lights to be slightly brighter, but I get the whole idea behind the ambiance factor, but at times I have to bring my face down to my plate in order to see specific ingredients in my food (First world problems).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=180,3.04,3.33,3.336,3.248,3.214

So damn good. The sauce they come with is delicious. Fried macaroni and cheese balls. I know,  I know.  It sounds like a heart attack on a plate.  My mouth has never loved something so much.  Every friend I've brought to cheesecake has tried them and you can watch the smile come across their face as the taste hits them.  General concensus : ""damn!"" Served on some marinara,  too good to be true.  Lunch / Dinner: Herb crusted salmon. Freaking delicioisness.  Comes atop some creamy, lemony sauce that's out of this world, with asparagus and mashed potatoes. I always mean to ask for extra sauce but I never remember.  Put that stuff on everything...it's good! Their soups change daily so when you hear the server say ""baked potato soup"" you say ""yes please!"" Creamy, cheesy, bacony...seriously incredible. Drink: Asian pear martini!! It's made with real pear puree so you'll get the yummy graininess of eating a fresh pear. My man gets them too because they're just that damn good. Cheesecake: all of them.  My personal faves are white chocolate raspberry, peanut butter cup, and the sinfully rich Godiva chocolate that comes with fresh whipped cream and a square of Godiva dark chocolate on top. Get it with cofee. Or if you're feeling fun, Irish coffee. I'm usually feeling fun!  If you're too full after the meal to eat cheesecake, get a slice to-go.

Table count:4. The positive. As I mentioned the wait was reasonable and the young man at front was very polite and courteous.  Our food consisted of a salad, the salmon dish and a shepherds pie for yours truly.  Each and every dish was impeccable, tasty and worth every bite.  I like to think that a good dish means less to take home.  We did not need any boxing today. The unfortunate:  I understand completely packed restaurants and hundreds of seated patrons with dozens more on the wings waiting patiently.  But table service was not what I had hoped at today at The Cheesecake Factory.  The water came out fine and in a few minutes,  we had to ask then wait over 10 minutes for the first batch of bread which has three loaves and was ok.  20 minutes later no follow up service and we had to ask for more bread which only brought 2 loaves and was more stale than a piece of croutons. The last positive was the drinks, pineapple Mojito's and typhoon punches.  Definitely hats off to the bartender.  Kind of made up for other aspects.   This is I think was a one off I generally have great experiences.  HAPPY DINING Yelpers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=260,3.32,3.35,3.344,3.12,3.338

I ordered that and my friend got the Louisiana chicken pasta. The spaghetti was really good. Those meatballs are no joke! They were so big and so yummy. The Louisiana chicken pasta is actually one of my usual dishes here. My friend ended up ordering that and I got to have the best of both worlds! Lucky me. That crusted chicken in the pasta has so much flavor. Total yumminess! The pasta can feel pretty heavy though, sometimes. It's pretty greasy. Probably all that butter they use to cook it, but it's good. We also ordered the loaded potato tots. I thought the tots were going to be actual tots with toppings on top like a nacho, but they're actually mashed potato deep fried with bacon and cheese inside, served with sour cream on the side. They were good. I like anything potato and fried. ;) The complimentary bread is so good. They serve the wheat bread warm and butter just melts on top. I always try not to eat so much bread, so I have room for my food, but that never happens. Their dishes are really big too. My friend and I both didn't finish our dishes. And we felt we still had a full dish by the end of our meal. Two people could share a dish if they wanted.  They have really good cheesecakes. I always come here wanting a cheesecake at the end of my meal, but most of the time, I never have room for it! Depending on when you come, there can be quite a wait for a table.

Our server was a man named Timothy. We got seated and he took our drink orders as well as our food orders. Since we were a party of 8, our table was really long. Timothy stood on one end of the table trying to take my sister's order (who was sitting on the other end), and she was literally yelling over the background chatter of the restaurant. He finally walks over to that side of the table to take their orders. Shouldn't it be common sense to move to the other end so people aren't shouting across the table?  Anyway, Tried to order my usual dish (chicken chipotle pasta with their Louisiana chicken instead of the honey glazed chicken) but he insisted that they don't allow the substitution at all because it's ""two completely different dishes"". I gave up, I didn't want to waste breath over a chicken substitution so I just ordered it regular.

And when it was time for the food boxing (past experiences, my waiters have 100% always brought the good back to be packed and brought it back to our table) he gave us 5 boxes to do it ourselves, and only one small bag. I don't know what the logic in that was.  Overall it was the worse service we've ever had here and we've been going occasionally for as long as I can remember.

We've all heard that the Cheesecake Factory is an excellent place to eat at and the food is super delicious. But my hubby and i's experience really tells a different story.  My hubby and I got to the restaurant at around dinner time, but we were seated rather quickly. We were given our complimentary bread and butter quickly, along with our drinks, which we decided to have just water.  Our waiter was really nice and quick at getting our orders down, without much deciding I decided to order the chicken bellagio while my husband decided to get the Kobe beef burger FIRST. The waiter left with our orders, but with some more deciding he decided to go with the fried mac and cheese burger (medium rare). He chased down the waiter and asked for a change, which our waiter did right away.  The wait for the food was sort of long, but we weren't upset because we had already expected the wait and we had our bread to munch on while we waited. My husbands food came out first, and then mine took a little while to come out after.  At first bite I wasn't too satisfied with the pasta, it was sort of dry and all stuck together, it didn't seem like it was fresh or that it was heated up all the way. My husband was also not satisfied with his burger, being super picky with his burgers, this one was cooked very well done, but he asked for it to be medium rare. We sent the burger back, but not the pasta because I'm less picky than he is.  The new burger was taking sort of long, but I think our waiter sensed that we were getting irritated because he offered us some soup. He also kept us updated on the burger and how much more we had to wait on it.  When his second burger finally came out though, it was perfect. Although on the negative side, we were both so full from the fries and soup and bread that we couldn't even finish our foods. I ended up eating only half of the portion that was on my plate. And my husband also ate just half of his burger. We ended up deciding to take it all to go, but I was displeased that our food wasn't boxed for us, and that we had to do it ourselves.  Overall our experience at the Cheesecake Factory was not such a pleasing one. Our food took forever to come, it wasn't fresh, we had to send one plate back, the wait was forever and in the end, we didn't even feel like trying some of their cheesecake.

I can't complain about the wraps during today's visit because they amazing as always! However, the Chicken Madeira today was really bad! The plate was cold; the cheese was hard; there was little to no flavor; and the whole plate was pretty much dry. I have to say I was not happy with today's visit. This place usually does a pretty good job in attending to their customer needs, but today the service wasn't even that great. In addition, the waitress brought us the wrong dessert and insisted that it was the right order.

I'm not sure if what we ordered made her upset or if she decided to not try giving us good service but after that her tone and attitude went down.  Too make my story short we noticed her being upbeat and cheerful with her other guest but with us it seemed she was over us. We weren't rude to her at all which in this case I would of been but my wife went over to the manager on duty and she came over and took care of the situation.  Diana was on it and was sorry we had a bad experience and ended up giving us a new waitress and a free cheesecake.

1369,Tim N.,"Sacramento, United States",233,13,,5.0,2016-06-25,"My friends and I arrived at The Cheesecake Factory on a busy Saturday evening around 5:30. Because Arden Fair is pretty busy on weekend evenings, it first took a while to find parking (I ended up parking in front of the UA entrance). After I walked over to the restaurant, I discovered that it would take nearly two hours before a table would be ready. Because we had a party of 15, I'm assuming that wait time is ""fairly reasonable"" - in the mean time, some of us visited Arden while the others remained to look over the menu. After our table was furnished, we were greeted by a friendly server and were served bread and drinks. The server was extremely professional in demeanor and illuminated our experience with small-talk. Some of my friends ordered sole cheesecake, while others ordered pasta and I ordered the Steak Diane - with such an array of menu options, the worst part of our experience was deciding which plate to order. After consuming the provided bread, our entrees were delivered in a timely manner. My stead was cooked well, but the entire dish was sitting in a pool of steak sauce, which was somewhat overwhelming. As we ate our meals, our waiter checked in periodically to ensure that everything was going smoothly and even bagged our plates to-go at the end of the meal.

The cheesecake itself is ok, but not really great in terms of flavor. They insist on offering about 40 varieties of EVERY category (from salad to pasta to dessert) but they don't really do anything particularly well.  They literally have so many entrees available that I don't remember any of them clearly, so if a friend suggests we go to Cheesecake Factory, I think ""yeah, I guess they're ok..""

I asked them if they had a candle since the cake was for a friend's birthday and they gave me one for free. I was so happy I didn't need to run to the store for one candle! I couldn't help myself and I was practically drooling so I ordered a slice of Chris' Outrageous for myself. They were both divine and we gobbled the cake up after singing happy birthday!

245,Rebecca A.,"Elk Grove, CA",66,81,22.0,3.0,2016-07-30,"Came here tonight for the first time with my boyfriend. We napped after work and woke up at 8pm hungry. We decided to use our gift card we got for here and have a late dinner.  Upon arrival at 9:20pm there wasn't a lot of parking open so we immediately prepared ourselves for a long wait. It was about 15-20 minutes though which is normal.  The waiting area and the cheesecake to go counter is right next to each other right as you enter, so the entrance is a cluster of people.  Once we got seated we immediately met our waitress who greeted us with hot bread and butter. She took our order of drinks: 2 waters and 1 Sierra Nevada(OMG IT WAS $9 ALMOST!!!) My water tasted really weird, almost like the taste of licking your finger after using nail polish remover. My boyfriends water was fine so I just didn't drink mine. I think it may have been something on the cup, maybe some soap residue making it taste a little strange. My boyfriend was ever so stoked to see the eggs and omelets are served all day! He's a huge breakfast foodie. He got a bacon ham and cheese omelet with English muffins and fried potatoes. He cut into his omelet and cheese, small bacon slices, and cubed ham just oozed out of it, it looked so good! He loved his food and was happy to have leftovers to heat up for breakfast. I got the cheese pizza. I have to say when it comes to pizza I don't care about anything, I'll eat whenever/where ever with any type of crust or cheese. When I bit into this pizza though I immediately got a smokey flavor almost like it was grilled? But the cheese had a very very fake taste. There were herbs like oregano and garlic in the cheese as well but it still couldn't mask the fake cheese flavor. Almost tasted like those off brand $1 cheese pizzas from the freezer aisle. It wasn't terrible but I didn't expect such a fake flavor from this restaurant. I asked for ranch to help change the flavor but the ranch was super sweet tasting at first and then ended tasting like garlic! I wasn't very impressed with my meal! Our waitress told us the cheesecake slices were half off tonight so we both got a slice! I of course being the caramel lover that I am got the Salted Caramel Cheesecake and my boyfriend being the Oreo fanatic he is got the Oreo Cheesecake!  Half off was nice and super unexpected!  My Salted Caramel Cheesecake slice tasted like the Ben and Jerrys Caramel Core ice cream!!! So good. A thick layer of caramel just coats the entire slice. Highly recommend if you love caramel! :) My boyfriends Oreo Cheesecake Slice was amazing. I'm not a huge chocolate person but he is and he was very impressed!

1146,Rebecca A.,"Elk Grove, United States",66,81,22.0,3.0,2016-07-30,"Came here tonight for the first time with my boyfriend. We napped after work and woke up at 8pm hungry. We decided to use our gift card we got for here and have a late dinner.  Upon arrival at 9:20pm there wasn't a lot of parking open so we immediately prepared ourselves for a long wait. It was about 15-20 minutes though which is normal.  The waiting area and the cheesecake to go counter is right next to each other right as you enter, so the entrance is a cluster of people.  Once we got seated we immediately met our waitress who greeted us with hot bread and butter. She took our order of drinks: 2 waters and 1 Sierra Nevada(OMG IT WAS $9 ALMOST!!!) My water tasted really weird, almost like the taste of licking your finger after using nail polish remover. My boyfriends water was fine so I just didn't drink mine. I think it may have been something on the cup, maybe some soap residue making it taste a little strange. My boyfriend was ever so stoked to see the eggs and omelets are served all day! He's a huge breakfast foodie. He got a bacon ham and cheese omelet with English muffins and fried potatoes. He cut into his omelet and cheese, small bacon slices, and cubed ham just oozed out of it, it looked so good! He loved his food and was happy to have leftovers to heat up for breakfast. I got the cheese pizza. I have to say when it comes to pizza I don't care about anything, I'll eat whenever/where ever with any type of crust or cheese. When I bit into this pizza though I immediately got a smokey flavor almost like it was grilled? But the cheese had a very very fake taste. There were herbs like oregano and garlic in the cheese as well but it still couldn't mask the fake cheese flavor. Almost tasted like those off brand $1 cheese pizzas from the freezer aisle. It wasn't terrible but I didn't expect such a fake flavor from this restaurant. I asked for ranch to help change the flavor but the ranch was super sweet tasting at first and then ended tasting like garlic! I wasn't very impressed with my meal! Our waitress told us the cheesecake slices were half off tonight so we both got a slice! I of course being the caramel lover that I am got the Salted Caramel Cheesecake and my boyfriend being the Oreo fanatic he is got the Oreo Cheesecake!  Half off was nice and super unexpected!  My Salted Caramel Cheesecake slice tasted like the Ben and Jerrys Caramel Core ice cream!!! So good. A thick layer of caramel just coats the entire slice. Highly recommend if you love caramel! :) My boyfriends Oreo Cheesecake Slice was amazing. I'm not a huge chocolate person but he is and he was very impressed!

They have so many tasty cheesecakes to choose from, it's nearly impossible! I came here to grab a slice of cake for my friend's birthday. I couldn't decide between two of them and asked the cashier what his take was on both flavors. I decided to get the new caramel cheesecake which was a great recommendation from the cashier! I asked them if they had a candle since the cake was for a friend's birthday and they gave me one for free. I was so happy I didn't need to run to the store for one candle! I couldn't help myself and I was practically drooling so I ordered a slice of Chris' Outrageous for myself. They were both divine and we gobbled the cake up after singing happy birthday!

Their food is delicious, affordable for the type of restaurant, and there is such a wide range of food options to choose from! In my opinion this is the perfect place for a romantic date night or a celebratory birthday dinner with friends and family!  I mean, you always start off on a good note here when the waiter brings you the delicious soft warm bread that you cannot help but indulge in. To be honest, I go through about 3 of those baskets before my meal even gets to me.  In regards to dishes, you really can't go wrong with any order here but just in case you'd like recommendations, my favorites include: the factory burrito grande and the spicy chipotle chicken pasta. I recently had the egg roll sampler appetizer for the first time and that was delicious too! Ps if you get the factory burrito grande prepare to come VERY HUNGRY! Or you can also take it home and eat it for the next 2 meals. A lot of the dishes are pretty big and I almost always take home leftovers Now comes dessert, because that's obviously the main reason everyone comes here!!! Bring on the cheesecake!!! My favorites are the s'mores cheesecake, the salted caramel cheesecake, and the red velvet one! But truthfully, you really can't go wrong with any of them.

I ordered that and my friend got the Louisiana chicken pasta. The spaghetti was really good. Those meatballs are no joke! They were so big and so yummy. The Louisiana chicken pasta is actually one of my usual dishes here. My friend ended up ordering that and I got to have the best of both worlds! Lucky me. That crusted chicken in the pasta has so much flavor. Total yumminess! The pasta can feel pretty heavy though, sometimes. It's pretty greasy. Probably all that butter they use to cook it, but it's good. We also ordered the loaded potato tots. I thought the tots were going to be actual tots with toppings on top like a nacho, but they're actually mashed potato deep fried with bacon and cheese inside, served with sour cream on the side. They were good. I like anything potato and fried. ;) The complimentary bread is so good. They serve the wheat bread warm and butter just melts on top. I always try not to eat so much bread, so I have room for my food, but that never happens. Their dishes are really big too. My friend and I both didn't finish our dishes. And we felt we still had a full dish by the end of our meal. Two people could share a dish if they wanted.  They have really good cheesecakes. I always come here wanting a cheesecake at the end of my meal, but most of the time, I never have room for it! Depending on when you come, there can be quite a wait for a table.

If you want to overeat on some ""meh"" food but don't have the patience for waiting for a table at Olive Garden, come here.  However, it IS possible to eat a normal portion and not waddle away...you just have to order an appetizer as your main course. The appetizers here are the size of a large-ish normal meal.

The cheesecake itself is ok, but not really great in terms of flavor. They insist on offering about 40 varieties of EVERY category (from salad to pasta to dessert) but they don't really do anything particularly well.  They literally have so many entrees available that I don't remember any of them clearly, so if a friend suggests we go to Cheesecake Factory, I think ""yeah, I guess they're ok..""

I had the Almond Crusted Salmon over Kale Salad which was missing the salad dressing--  no biggie, didn't need the calories anyway.  My mom had the Skinnylicious Enchiladas Plate-- not sure why she would order Mexican food here, but she said it was okay.  My sister had the Avacado Egg Rolls--  she didn't finish them so I can only assume they weren't ""the best she ever had.""  I tasted a piece & thought they were good.  Our server was really nice.  Overall, dinner was 3 stars, pretty average chain-restaurant experience.   As we were leaving, I decided to order 3 slices of cheesecake to-go.  We got to our hotel room looking forward to tasting them, but unfortunately THEY WERE FROZEN!!  Like biting into ice cream FROZEN!  Not sure why they didn't just tell us, hey these are frozen so wait a bit to eat them.  No one said a word!  I mean, had I ordered this to our table, I'm sure they would have brought me a thawed piece of cheesecake, omg!!   Anyway, after paying $8 per slice, we had to put them in the hotel  room fridge until morning... then we had to checkout & be at day 2 of the conference from 7am - noon...  yeah, didn't really get to enjoy that $25 + tip of cheesecake!  So I decided to call a mgr to let them know about the cheesecake mishap...   I spoke with Diana...  she claimed to be the mgr.  She listened & explained ""see what had happened was...""  yada yada, someone dropped the ball.  She agreed that we shouldn't have been served frozen cheesecake  (""deeply chilled"" as she called it).  She concluded with an apology & a thank you for coming in & thanks for bringing it our attention so that next time--- uuhh, NO hun, there will not be a next time since you clearly do not value or respect your customers.  I wasn't looking for a freebie; I was hoping she would be interested in rectifying the wrong.  For now, I refuse to waste my time, energy, or finances on *hoping* for a better outcome next time...  especially after basically thanking me for throwing $30 of your cheesecake into the conference hall trashcan, haha!  Sorry, but no.  If this is any indication of her mgmt style, then I understand how we were served frozen cheesecake.  Too bad I didn't stop by after the conference to return the ruined cheesecake!  Guess Diana would have preferred that I FURTHER inconvenience myself by driving out of my way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=240,3.76,3.4,3.344,3.0120000000000005,3.544

The buffalo kicker appetizer was cooked in oil that was too cold resulting in grease, grease and more grease. My server was pleasant when she brought me a new order, exactly the same as before-inedible.  My Kobe burger ordered medium-well was charred to oblivion, far past what I asked for. The meat was dry and burned on the bottom. The 'sauteed' mushrooms were dry and raw, also inedible. The sweet potato fries were cold and tasteless.  The upside? Good service and delicious iced tea.

I think it's the variety that does it for me, they do several things well. My go to appetizer is the buffalo blast, Its the perfect mix of fried, chicken, spice, and cheese. Its their take on a buffalo wing and I am in love with it! This was also the first place I ever had fried mac n cheese, and till this day it is my favorite.  For dinner I also have several items I enjoy: kobe burger, cajun pasta, chicken madeira, farfale pasta, and the hibachi steak. During last nights visit I had the kobe burger and it was cooked perfectly, but the fries it came with tasted mediocre at best. I enjoyed a 22oz. Stela with the burger, which was the perfect mix to a long day at work. Thankfully I had a little room in the tank and ordered a chocolate cheesecake. The cake was fresh tasting and did not taste like a store bought cheesecake.  The only reason I can't give this place 5-stars is due to the spotty service. Unfortunately it is never consistent. I have had decent service, but on several occasions I have had poor service. I don't know why but the servers forget about you and aren't prompt majority of the times with requests (bread, extra sauce, utensils). On a side note I would also ask for the brightness of the lights to be slightly brighter, but I get the whole idea behind the ambiance factor, but at times I have to bring my face down to my plate in order to see specific ingredients in my food (First world problems).",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=180,3.72,3.53,3.436,3.216,3.6060000000000003

I had the Almond Crusted Salmon over Kale Salad which was missing the salad dressing--  no biggie, didn't need the calories anyway.  My mom had the Skinnylicious Enchiladas Plate-- not sure why she would order Mexican food here, but she said it was okay.  My sister had the Avacado Egg Rolls--  she didn't finish them so I can only assume they weren't ""the best she ever had.""  I tasted a piece & thought they were good.  Our server was really nice.  Overall, dinner was 3 stars, pretty average chain-restaurant experience.   As we were leaving, I decided to order 3 slices of cheesecake to-go.  We got to our hotel room looking forward to tasting them, but unfortunately THEY WERE FROZEN!!  Like biting into ice cream FROZEN!  Not sure why they didn't just tell us, hey these are frozen so wait a bit to eat them.  No one said a word!  I mean, had I ordered this to our table, I'm sure they would have brought me a thawed piece of cheesecake, omg!!   Anyway, after paying $8 per slice, we had to put them in the hotel  room fridge until morning... then we had to checkout & be at day 2 of the conference from 7am - noon...  yeah, didn't really get to enjoy that $25 + tip of cheesecake!  So I decided to call a mgr to let them know about the cheesecake mishap...   I spoke with Diana...  she claimed to be the mgr.  She listened & explained ""see what had happened was...""  yada yada, someone dropped the ball.  She agreed that we shouldn't have been served frozen cheesecake  (""deeply chilled"" as she called it).  She concluded with an apology & a thank you for coming in & thanks for bringing it our attention so that next time--- uuhh, NO hun, there will not be a next time since you clearly do not value or respect your customers.  I wasn't looking for a freebie; I was hoping she would be interested in rectifying the wrong.  For now, I refuse to waste my time, energy, or finances on *hoping* for a better outcome next time...  especially after basically thanking me for throwing $30 of your cheesecake into the conference hall trashcan, haha!  Sorry, but no.  If this is any indication of her mgmt style, then I understand how we were served frozen cheesecake.  Too bad I didn't stop by after the conference to return the ruined cheesecake!  Guess Diana would have preferred that I FURTHER inconvenience myself by driving out of my way.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=240,3.6,3.49,3.404,3.0440000000000005,3.5340000000000003

1142,Ashley K.,"San Bruno, United States",63,60,47.0,5.0,2016-12-03,"I'm a cheesecake factory fan, that is for sure.  In my opinion it is hands down the best chain restaurant there is.  If you want to have a great experience like I do,  here's what you need to order: Appetizers:  Avocado egg rolls! So damn good. The sauce they come with is delicious. Fried macaroni and cheese balls. I know,  I know.  It sounds like a heart attack on a plate.  My mouth has never loved something so much.  Every friend I've brought to cheesecake has tried them and you can watch the smile come across their face as the taste hits them.  General concensus : ""damn!"" Served on some marinara,  too good to be true.  Lunch / Dinner: Herb crusted salmon. Freaking delicioisness.  Comes atop some creamy, lemony sauce that's out of this world, with asparagus and mashed potatoes. I always mean to ask for extra sauce but I never remember.  Put that stuff on everything...it's good! Their soups change daily so when you hear the server say ""baked potato soup"" you say ""yes please!"" Creamy, cheesy, bacony...seriously incredible. Drink: Asian pear martini!! It's made with real pear puree so you'll get the yummy graininess of eating a fresh pear. My man gets them too because they're just that damn good. Cheesecake: all of them.  My personal faves are white chocolate raspberry, peanut butter cup, and the sinfully rich Godiva chocolate that comes with fresh whipped cream and a square of Godiva dark chocolate on top. Get it with cofee. Or if you're feeling fun, Irish coffee. I'm usually feeling fun!  If you're too full after the meal to eat cheesecake, get a slice to-go.

Table count:4. The positive. As I mentioned the wait was reasonable and the young man at front was very polite and courteous.  Our food consisted of a salad, the salmon dish and a shepherds pie for yours truly.  Each and every dish was impeccable, tasty and worth every bite.  I like to think that a good dish means less to take home.  We did not need any boxing today. The unfortunate:  I understand completely packed restaurants and hundreds of seated patrons with dozens more on the wings waiting patiently.  But table service was not what I had hoped at today at The Cheesecake Factory.  The water came out fine and in a few minutes,  we had to ask then wait over 10 minutes for the first batch of bread which has three loaves and was ok.  20 minutes later no follow up service and we had to ask for more bread which only brought 2 loaves and was more stale than a piece of croutons. The last positive was the drinks, pineapple Mojito's and typhoon punches.  Definitely hats off to the bartender.  Kind of made up for other aspects.   This is I think was a one off I generally have great experiences.  HAPPY DINING Yelpers.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=260,3.76,3.62,3.456,2.9280000000000004,3.676

I wasn't too big on the pizza, nothing about it really stood out to me. The jambalaya said it was going to be in a very spicy sauce, but I felt it was mild. The shrimp and chicken pieces were very tender and juicy. As for the sauce of the pasta, it was just ok to me. Again, nothing stood out.  For dessert we ordered the salted caramel cheesecake. And holy moley! It was sweet. Very rich and creamy. And their slices are always very generous. I never finish them either, so it's always a good idea to share that as well.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=20,3.64,3.56,3.42,2.8000000000000003,3.5920000000000005

Our server took his time getting our drink order, which he got wrong despite bringing an alcoholic beverage to our table prior to checking our ID.  Our complimentary bread basket was only brought to our table after our server noticed he had brought the two adjacent tables theirs. Once our orders were taken, the wait seemed normal. Our appetizer came about 5-7 minutes after. However, our entrees took an additional 45 minutes to come out. A simple order of an omelette breakfast plate, and a Louisiana chicken pasta dinner.  Our server only checking in after about 15 minutes of our adjacent tables receiving their entrees. Who mind you, were 5-10 minutes later in arrival than us. Our server then gave us the update that the kitchen ""just got smacked"" and our orders were coming. Was that before or after our adjacent tables got their orders?  Once our entrees arrived it was immediately noticeable that the Louisiana chicken pasta had been sitting out for quite some time. The pasta was extremely rubbery, the chicken dry, and sauce had come down to a temperature only slightly above the room's.  Overall, surprisingly dissatisfied at the service.

I was transferred and put on hold to make an order after a 2 minute wait. The order taker asked what I wanted, my name, and gave me the price to pay. I got the Cuban sandwich order with fries. The representative didn't tell me how long it's going to be or ask for my phone number to let me know it is done. 10:17 PM Arrived in the parking lot and it wasn't busy since there were a few spots open along the restaurant. Expecting to get the meal within a few minutes. 10:18 Paid for the food at the to-go/cheesecake display area. While waiting we noticed other people were waiting for the cashier to help them out. They must have been at the cashier's for at least 5 minutes without being helped. We also noticed that it wasn't as busy as it normally is since their hallway wait area was not packed and there were empty tables. 10:55 PM Got the TAKE-OUT Cuban sandwich. Way too long of a wait time. 10:56 PM I noticed the fries and sandwich were lukewarm. Didn't even bother to ask for hot food because the wait time was not worth it. 11:10 PM Got home and ate the meal. The sandwich was good because of the great quality meats they had and the fresh bread, but again lukewarm. Not worth the wait. There were about 20 fries in the bag and they were comparable to Burger King's. Not worth the extra dollars for the Cheese Cake Factory name attached. Some of the fries had a frozen fry taste to it as well. I suggest to not get fries or if anything, order them extra crispy to make it palatable. Or maybe even get the side salad instead of fries. In general, I would give them 0 stars and not come back due to the approximate 48 minute wait time for a TAKE OUT order and my meal being under par for having to wait during a time when the restaurant isn't that busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=100,3.56,3.46,3.416,2.468,3.5000000000000004

The bread they serve first while we all wait for our order is so good though! I only take a small bite... Their utensils sometimes have dry foods from before stuck on it and that's quite disgusting to me. Ever since this experience, I've been coming here once every 6 months or once a year, but it's slowly becoming none a year. And I don't order their food anymore. Just the cheesecake cause who doesn't love cheesecake? :) 4 STARS FOR THE CHEESECAKE THOUGH! I rarely come here, but when I do, it's usually with my sisters.

However what upset me was the way this was handled - so unprofessional and lazy. This WAS a door dash order so I get that the money is handled through Door Dash- fine. You would think though, that since CHEESECAKE FACTORY'S employee is the one who royally messed up the salad, they would take responsibility. But no. Door dash is responsible for the delivery and they did great - arrived early, no hassle... The restaurant is supposed to know how to make their own food. I ordered The Vegan Cobb salad and not only did it have CHEESE (hello...not vegan) but it had two other items it was NOT supposed to have. Also, it was MISSING 5 major items which made up the bulk of the salad -  almonds, sunflower seeds, quinoa, garbanzo beans, and avocado were all missing. When I called and spoke with the hostess she was really nice but then gave me to the manager, Dandy. Dandy was super inflexible, took no responsibility, did not apologize or offer any compensation just kept saying I had to go through door dash. I was *not asking him to give me my money back* all I wanted was for it to be remade. When I asked him for his name he hung up on me. I called back and called him out on it. He denied it.

If you go during the weekends or peek hours than be prepared to wait and they don't do call aheads. Always love the complimentary breads they give. I usually order the firecracker salmon or calamari as appetizers. The firecracker salmon is amazing but they only give 4 pieces for the price of $12. Yes, like the other yelpers have stated that the main dishes can be pricey but the portion of food given is a lot, I always ended up sharing a plate with someone else.

We started with appetizers, they were delicious!  The spinach dip & chips is a MUST ($12). So is the cheesy garlic bread ($10) I'm very impressed.  Next time I'll just order appetizers instead of dinner.  For dinner I had the Steak Diana plate cooked medium ($20). The sauce included caramelized onions and mushrooms. The plate came with the steak already cut up into small chunks and a buttery mashed potatoes. My plate was a solid 5 star meal.  It wasn't dry at all, just all around juicy. And the portion was just right.  My mom ordered the Chicken Marsala($19) and she enjoyed the chicken, but she didn't like the pasta it came with. My dad ordered the Carne Asada medallions ($15)  and it came with rice and corn. He also said he enjoyed his plate but he expected a more flavor. My brother has the Chicken fettuccine Alfredo ($20) and it was a decent portion. Clearly, there was no room for dessert so we all ordered a cheesecake to go. They were all a huge $8 slice.  In the end we ordered 4 cokes ($4 each) , 2 appetizers, 4 dinner plates, & 3 cheesecakes and the total came out to $145.00. I personally thought it was a lot of money for a restaurant that super fancy or anything, but again the food was good. So I would totally come here again but only for a special occasion like a birthday or anniversary or something. It just seems a little over the top to pay $145 for 4 people to have dinner (my own opinion of course). Hence my 4 star rating. I wouldn't come just to have a week night dinner.

I was transferred and put on hold to make an order after a 2 minute wait. The order taker asked what I wanted, my name, and gave me the price to pay. I got the Cuban sandwich order with fries. The representative didn't tell me how long it's going to be or ask for my phone number to let me know it is done. 10:17 PM Arrived in the parking lot and it wasn't busy since there were a few spots open along the restaurant. Expecting to get the meal within a few minutes. 10:18 Paid for the food at the to-go/cheesecake display area. While waiting we noticed other people were waiting for the cashier to help them out. They must have been at the cashier's for at least 5 minutes without being helped. We also noticed that it wasn't as busy as it normally is since their hallway wait area was not packed and there were empty tables. 10:55 PM Got the TAKE-OUT Cuban sandwich. Way too long of a wait time. 10:56 PM I noticed the fries and sandwich were lukewarm. Didn't even bother to ask for hot food because the wait time was not worth it. 11:10 PM Got home and ate the meal. The sandwich was good because of the great quality meats they had and the fresh bread, but again lukewarm. Not worth the wait. There were about 20 fries in the bag and they were comparable to Burger King's. Not worth the extra dollars for the Cheese Cake Factory name attached. Some of the fries had a frozen fry taste to it as well. I suggest to not get fries or if anything, order them extra crispy to make it palatable. Or maybe even get the side salad instead of fries. In general, I would give them 0 stars and not come back due to the approximate 48 minute wait time for a TAKE OUT order and my meal being under par for having to wait during a time when the restaurant isn't that busy.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=100,3.76,3.22,3.376,2.244,3.4360000000000004

Usually, there is a line outside when I drive by on weekends, but it was a weekday, so not too busy. There was a 10 minute wait, but that wasn't bad, considering I've waited way too long at other restaurants that weren't worth the wait. Our servers were friendly and I got a birthday song. Also got a complimentary sundae with a candle! The food was delicious and left us all stuffed. Which saddened me because if you're visiting here, you want to taste the cheesecake. I couldn't eat any there, but bought two pieces to enjoy at home. I've only had a forkful of the key lime cheesecake and I can see why this place is so popular. Was a bit pricy, but less than $100 for 3 people and extra cheesecake is pretty nice.  Only thing that was bad was a friend of mine ordered a burger well done, but she got it rare.

167,Tim C.,"San Francisco, CA",27,4,4.0,1.0,2017-06-01,"Overall the service started out normal. As with any Cheesecake Factory, busy, but not overly so that their service and timing of entrees leaving the kitchen would be delayed in such a way that would be noticeable. Our server took his time getting our drink order, which he got wrong despite bringing an alcoholic beverage to our table prior to checking our ID.  Our complimentary bread basket was only brought to our table after our server noticed he had brought the two adjacent tables theirs. Once our orders were taken, the wait seemed normal. Our appetizer came about 5-7 minutes after. However, our entrees took an additional 45 minutes to come out. A simple order of an omelette breakfast plate, and a Louisiana chicken pasta dinner.  Our server only checking in after about 15 minutes of our adjacent tables receiving their entrees. Who mind you, were 5-10 minutes later in arrival than us. Our server then gave us the update that the kitchen ""just got smacked"" and our orders were coming. Was that before or after our adjacent tables got their orders?  Once our entrees arrived it was immediately noticeable that the Louisiana chicken pasta had been sitting out for quite some time. The pasta was extremely rubbery, the chicken dry, and sauce had come down to a temperature only slightly above the room's.  Overall, surprisingly dissatisfied at the service. This is extremely rare as I've had many great experiences with this restaurant in their various locations. Maybe it was just an off night, but in either case, it will be a while before I step foot inside another Cheesecake Factory, or at least this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=180,3.56,3.24,3.336,2.372,3.3680000000000008

Then when I went to order an appetizer, the server told me to pause because had to check if they had it. So I asked him, keep it simple, let me know what you don't have so I can know what not to order. He comes back out and the list is pretty long (17 items). Someone somewhere messed up and didn't order  correctly to keep their inventory full. The server told us they were out of most of the items by noon.  Both steak Diane's came with so many mushrooms, we had to brush them off to find the steak. At least it was cooked as requested (medium). The fries our table ordered were salty.  They would have gotten 2 stars if it wasn't for our server who tried his best to make up for the restaurants shortcomings.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=40,3.64,3.25,3.332,2.604,3.406

1585,Romeo S.,"Sacramento, United States",0,2,1.0,1.0,2017-06-12,"Let me start off by stating that I love this place and my review is based on an experience we recently had. I must state that I do work in the same complex as these guys so I am more favorable of my opinions towards this place, but not this time. However, We see the same security walk and drive by daily. We park behind the green lines everyday. So if the server who helped us had come into our store, knowing he worked closed by, we would ensure his experience was nothing less than exceptional. This server had a condescending demeanor about him. He did not come by for a while and when we waived him down we had to practically beg for more water. In doing so, he rolled his eyes, walked away and returned with a slam on our table with more water. I am so perplexed to how he is in customer service. No one should be treated as if they were less than a human, especially not in a professional environment. Our horrific experience has tainted our impression on this once great location which has now forced us to do our monthly meetings at another restaurant in the complex. So who was responsible for this horrendous behavior that it has forced me to write such a review? The demonic servers name is Luis M. And if you are punished by receiving him as your server, run and run fast.

I ordered the tomato basil pasta which was good and a good portion my friend ordered the enchiladas which was okay wasn't that great. After dinner we ordered 5 desserts To go 2 tiramisu cales 1 key lime pie 1 mango key lime and a salted caramel cheesecake. Although the server only came back with all but the salted caramel which I just let it go cause while waiting for the check I managed to finish the mango key lime pie (couldn't resist). The tiramisu cakes didn't look at all appealing therefore I returned it requesting for one that would look edible like the other desserts I got. And keep in mind I have ordered the tiramisu dessert before. He returned it back with the same exact cakes and this time the cakes were worst and it was just a mess in the box. So I walked over and ask politely to take it off my bill I didn't expect him to holler over to the pastry workers to point out Im the one who decline to his cake. I was in shocked I could not believe this server Luis m. Would point out loud and clear in front of me that I am the person who doesn't want the desserts.. I will think twice about coming back.

First off, our waiter was kinda cold if I may say. He asked what drinks he could get for us and looked quite impatient while my boyfriend was looking through the menu since we had just sat down. He ended up just getting a water since he noticed that the waiter looked irritated. He then came back and mumbled ""can I start you guys off with some bread and butter?"" I could barely hear what he said and my boyfriend couldn't hear at all and it's not like it was extra loud in there.  Food wise, my boyfriend got the steak Diane and said it was pretty good. I got what I always get: Louisiana chicken pasta. However, mine didn't have much flavor and it was really oily. At other locations, they always come with the block of Parmesan cheese right when they bring me my plate of pasta but this one didn't. It didn't bother me much until it took me over 5 mins to flag down a waiter/waitress for some cheese (we were sitting in an area where waiters and waitresses were coming and going so 5 mins was kinda pushing it). Food did come fast but our appetizer came like 10 mins after our main courses and what we had ordered was literally grilled cheese with a piece a bacon so idk why it took so long lol.  As for service the rest of the night, we never saw our waiter again. It wasn't even him who brought us our food. No one came by to ask how we were doing. We had to wait over 20 mins just to ask for boxes for our food and for the check. However, the lady who did help us at the end with the boxes and check seemed pretty friendly and was the type of customer service I was used to seeing at a Cheesecake Factory.  We tipped really little (didn't even want to tip tbh) and that's coming from people who always tip, even at little snack and drink places.  Tldr; love Cheesecake Factory, just not this one.

If i went elsewhere, the wait might be longer.  I didn't get my food till 6:25, that's 25 minutes after the time i specifically told them i wanted the food to be READY for pick-up. Tell me?  What is the point of calling in early when you have to end up waiting anyway.  Had a meeting at 6:30, and wanted to eat something before then but due to poor staff abilities, i showed up late and was not able to eat my food till later, around 7:30.  Bad bad experience, makes me think twice before putting anymore money into this establishment! **NOTE on another occasion i called for road side pick up, gave them info of the car i would be driving.  they said to call a certain number when i was ready outside,  After picking up the kids i was relieved to just drive up and pick up our food. Got there and gave them a call, said no you have to come in, AGAIN what is the point of giving me all these options and not falling through with it?? Makes no sense! Had to get out of my car with a bunch of kids, maneuver my way into the restaurant and grab my food.  If i did not have my kids with me, no problem, but i chose this option for a reason and Cheesecake Factory just couldn't pull through.

As for me, I dig it!  I have two very safe go-to meals at the Factory - their fantastic Thai For White People dish called Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp (coconut peanut heaven, and easily 3 meals on one plate), and their killer Club Sandwich, probably the best club sandwich I've ever had.

It was family tradition to dine here for my birthday celebration every year (since I was 18, I'm 22 now), but I'm sad to say it's time for a change. The wait was exactly 30 mins so not mad about that, but it all started going downhill when the lady seated us at our table pulling a chair out into the middle of the walkway when I preferred sitting on the booth side so I had to push the chair back in and make my way to the booth.. not a big deal just annoying. Then our server came by and we ordered drinks and you guessed it, he totally forgot mine. I just knew he should've taken notes before he even left the table. I still gave the server the benefit of the doubt and assumed he was new and poorly trained.  20 mins after waiting for the server to take down our order, we waited a whole 45 mins before food got to us.. and it wasn't even our food. This lady came to our table with fried macaroni like no, not us but seriously where's our food. Quit playing. One guy literally had 1 table and kept passing them multiple times.. seriously a waste of productivity. It was so unorganized like did all the managers and experienced workers go on vacation or.  Another 15 mins later, entres come out.. before appetizers. Now I'm not even mad anymore, just confused. So let's talk about the entre, farfalle specifically terrible there was a piece of string cheese in it, looked more like a lunch potion than a dinner one trust me I would know since that is the only thing I get from this place. Got charged for the farfalle with chicken when I got it without the chicken, makes no sense. Okay appetizers, don't recommend any of them: tater tots, fried zucchini, nachos all a big thumbs down. I mean factory nachos were a go-to until they burned it.. like how does that happen? The chips were brown, anyone could see that even under the dim light. Yet the server, Theodore who insisted we call him Teddy, (firstly you aren't sweet nor cute like a Teddy so no one is going to call you that) even questioned me like wth, dumb (bleep) you eat it then mf.

On the positive side, the food was good. It is the same as every Cheesecake Factory so you can expect some consistency there. But really, does anyone go there for the food or the cheesecake? You go for a bite to eat and a piece or cheesecake right. My cheesecake of choice? The Dulce de Leche cheesecake. Hands down. There were specials there as well like the double chocolate something and birthday cake cheesecakes but my favorite will always be what I order. The waiter was polite. The hostess greeted us and sat us as soon as they could. So, yah. I would recommend this Cheesecake Factory and will probably go there again.  Why the loss of 2 stars then since I liked it so much? Hands down the prices are way too high. My wife and I got 2 chicken plates, 2 ice teas and 2 pieces of cheesecake. $100. $3.50 for an ice tea that we had a hard time getting refilled. So the prices have gotten a little out of touch. Maybe next time we will eat before and just go there for the desert. My second star was removed for a combination of factors. First the restaurant was busy so we had to wait for a couple minutes. No big deal and no star removed for that. But when we were sat we got the tiny table in the back corner that always seems to be forgotten about. So as we waited at this tiny table we were overlooked by our server a couple times.

23,Nicole B.,"Elk Grove, CA",269,211,644.0,4.0,2017-07-10,"My two cents on Cheesecake  Atmosphere-  Usually located in most midsize and large cities.Besides Sac I have been to Walnut Creek, LA, Atlanta, with San Francisco being my favorite.  Spacious, good size bar,  plenty of seating. Casual while being slightly elegant.  Great place for a casual date, family, outing or special occasion.   Service- Like most chains hit or miss. Some occasions service is stellar. Can get prompt, friendly, efficient service. Other times you can get a subpar server, and service can be slow.  Food-  The highlight of Cheesecake factory is the wide variety of their menu. From the burgers, salads, appetizers, to full size entrees they have something for everyone. Servings are generous and the food is always tasty. Wide variety of cocktails that are delicious with many creative non alcohol drinks as well.  And of course their Cheesecake....So many choices,  creamy and with a good size crust..My favorites are the white chocolate raspberry and the banana caramel.  Salivating just writing this review!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=20,3.0,3.06,3.156,2.9920000000000004,3.0360000000000005

It was family tradition to dine here for my birthday celebration every year (since I was 18, I'm 22 now), but I'm sad to say it's time for a change. The wait was exactly 30 mins so not mad about that, but it all started going downhill when the lady seated us at our table pulling a chair out into the middle of the walkway when I preferred sitting on the booth side so I had to push the chair back in and make my way to the booth.. not a big deal just annoying. Then our server came by and we ordered drinks and you guessed it, he totally forgot mine. I just knew he should've taken notes before he even left the table. I still gave the server the benefit of the doubt and assumed he was new and poorly trained.  20 mins after waiting for the server to take down our order, we waited a whole 45 mins before food got to us.. and it wasn't even our food. This lady came to our table with fried macaroni like no, not us but seriously where's our food. Quit playing. One guy literally had 1 table and kept passing them multiple times.. seriously a waste of productivity. It was so unorganized like did all the managers and experienced workers go on vacation or.  Another 15 mins later, entres come out.. before appetizers. Now I'm not even mad anymore, just confused. So let's talk about the entre, farfalle specifically terrible there was a piece of string cheese in it, looked more like a lunch potion than a dinner one trust me I would know since that is the only thing I get from this place. Got charged for the farfalle with chicken when I got it without the chicken, makes no sense. Okay appetizers, don't recommend any of them: tater tots, fried zucchini, nachos all a big thumbs down. I mean factory nachos were a go-to until they burned it.. like how does that happen? The chips were brown, anyone could see that even under the dim light. Yet the server, Theodore who insisted we call him Teddy, (firstly you aren't sweet nor cute like a Teddy so no one is going to call you that) even questioned me like wth, dumb (bleep) you eat it then mf.  Then dessert time rolled around and we would've gotten cheesecakes but unfortunately I was nervous about waiting another hour or Theodore not getting the order right, so we paid our dues and ran for our lives.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=40,2.88,2.98,3.144,2.308,2.94

This place is a great place for large parties, family get togethers, and even romantic dates! The bar area is cool because it's large with tvs so you can eat appetizers and watch the football games!  Parking is okay, can get very busy but there is plenty of parking because it's connected with the mall. They also have valet parking as well. Food is average, nothing spectacular! They have a wide variety of choices which is good when you bring a large group but I feel the food is only mediocre.  I've had their burgers, to pastas to the steak. Just recently I had the spicy crispy chicken sandwich and it was very dry... the chicken was not moist but the chipotle mayo was good. I also tried the BBQ burger and again, it was dry.... overcooked. The fries are crispy and good but the burgers are only so so. My lady had the fish tacos and they were good, not great. You can have your fish tacos either fried or grilled and we had it grilled which was a good decision....  We tried 3 different apps... the deep fried mac and cheese balls, stuffed mushrooms and fried zucchini! The mushrooms were small and you only get 6... flavor blend.... the zucchini was small and lacked flavor. The fried mac and cheese balls were really good... good batter and flavor... my favorite of the night.

63,Todd B.,"Olivehurst, CA",0,73,,3.0,2017-09-07,"So, my reviews always start out with 5 stars and I take one star away for every negative I experience. On the positive side, the food was good. It is the same as every Cheesecake Factory so you can expect some consistency there. But really, does anyone go there for the food or the cheesecake? You go for a bite to eat and a piece or cheesecake right. My cheesecake of choice? The Dulce de Leche cheesecake. Hands down. There were specials there as well like the double chocolate something and birthday cake cheesecakes but my favorite will always be what I order. The waiter was polite. The hostess greeted us and sat us as soon as they could. So, yah. I would recommend this Cheesecake Factory and will probably go there again.  Why the loss of 2 stars then since I liked it so much? Hands down the prices are way too high. My wife and I got 2 chicken plates, 2 ice teas and 2 pieces of cheesecake. $100. $3.50 for an ice tea that we had a hard time getting refilled. So the prices have gotten a little out of touch. Maybe next time we will eat before and just go there for the desert. My second star was removed for a combination of factors. First the restaurant was busy so we had to wait for a couple minutes. No big deal and no star removed for that. But when we were sat we got the tiny table in the back corner that always seems to be forgotten about. So as we waited at this tiny table we were overlooked by our server a couple times. I would have waited another 10-15 minutes just for a real table. Anyway, not too shabby.

Here's what happened, yes, all in one night: never got a soup spoon with my bowl of soup, (it's a giant bowl), we asked for straws three times with two different people, our server spilled water all over our table and my friend by accidentally dropping the butter dish for the bread, they replaced the fries that the water spilled on, but not her utensils and napkin. Our server was completely apologetic but I felt like we had to ask for everything! This is only for the service.... Now for the kitchen: it took about 45 mins for our food to come out. We waited so long that the booth behind us had 2 different parties that had come and gone. Also, My friend that got spilled on ordered orange chicken with extra vegetables and white rice. Our server wrote it down right but the kitchen plated it without rice. My other friend ordered carne asada medallions with rice... her poor plate had 3 chunks of meat on it... it looked like the saddest plate in the world! If you're hungry, don't order that!

I'm also really upset about the fact they charge for their Special ranch sauce that I used to have with their brown (wheat) bread.

It's a little too expensive for the bland taste it can be. The bread they serve first while we all wait for our order is so good though! I only take a small bite... Their utensils sometimes have dry foods from before stuck on it and that's quite disgusting to me. Ever since this experience, I've been coming here once every 6 months or once a year, but it's slowly becoming none a year. And I don't order their food anymore. Just the cheesecake cause who doesn't love cheesecake? :) 4 STARS FOR THE CHEESECAKE THOUGH! I rarely come here, but when I do, it's usually with my sisters. I'm mainly here for the variety of cheesecake that they have. It's hard to choose what to eat since they all sound and look delicious.

1545,Nicole B.,"Elk Grove, United States",269,211,644.0,4.0,2017-10-07,"My two cents on Cheesecake  Atmosphere-  Usually located in most midsize and large cities.Besides Sac I have been to Walnut Creek, LA, Atlanta, with San Francisco being my favorite.  Spacious, good size bar,  plenty of seating. Casual while being slightly elegant.  Great place for a casual date, family, outing or special occasion.   Service- Like most chains hit or miss. Some occasions service is stellar. Can get prompt, friendly, efficient service. Other times you can get a subpar server, and service can be slow.  Food-  The highlight of Cheesecake factory is the wide variety of their menu. From the burgers, salads, appetizers, to full size entrees they have something for everyone. Servings are generous and the food is always tasty. Wide variety of cocktails that are delicious with many creative non alcohol drinks as well.  And of course their Cheesecake....So many choices,  creamy and with a good size crust..My favorites are the white chocolate raspberry and the banana caramel.  Salivating just writing this review!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=20,3.36,3.13,3.136,2.9600000000000004,3.222

Tonight I called my dinner order in (Fish N Chips and the Spicy Chicken Sandwich with Fries) and was told it would be ready in 20 minutes. I arrived about 20 minutes later and called to let them know I had arrived to pick up my order. The person who answered (Silvia) transferred me over to the to go section. I waited on hold for 14 minutes and not one person picked up that line. I hung up and then called back. Silvia answered again and I let her know I waited on hold for about 15 minutes to let them know that I was there to pick up my order. She said they were busy and she would let them know I was there. Another 20 minutes went by and still no one had brought our food out. I called back and Silvia answered again...I explained it had be close to 1 hour since I made my order and had been waiting for my order for 40 minutes. She apologized and said she would let them know. 5 minutes later a server came out to our truck with the receipt for our order to collect payment before he brought out our food. I told him I was really frustrated because it had been an hour since I called in my ordered and I was originally told it would be about 20 minutes. I told him I had been waiting in my car for 40 minutes and have called 3 times to let them know I was there for my order. The server was baffled that I had called 3 times and proceeded to tell me that they JUST NOW told him we were there to pick up our order. He told me he would go get a manager to speak to me. A few minutes later he came back out with our food and a manager. I explained my frustration about the situation and asked her if my food had been sitting in there the whole time. Neither the manager or the server knew how long our food was sitting out from. I told her that we had ordered fish N chips and that is not something that should be sitting out for a period of time if that was the case. She said she was going to take care of our charges and said I have your food here now for you. We really just wanted our food and wanted to get home. The worst part is that when we got home and pulled the food out nothing was edible. The fries were cold and hard as rocks, his fish was soggy and cold, my chicken sandwich was hard and cold. This told me that our food sat out for an extended period of time, yet the manager still gave it to us. This was all the way around unacceptable!

Then when I got home, I was highly disappointed. My favorite pasta that I always get (Pasta da Vinci), it was just plain awful. There was literally no sauce, it tasted old, dry and it looked like they literally just microwaved it and put it in a take out box.

Basically online order was messed up and I thought I would just call and they would offer to remake it and I could go pick it up for dinner after work. However what upset me was the way this was handled - so unprofessional and lazy. This WAS a door dash order so I get that the money is handled through Door Dash- fine. You would think though, that since CHEESECAKE FACTORY'S employee is the one who royally messed up the salad, they would take responsibility. But no. Door dash is responsible for the delivery and they did great - arrived early, no hassle... The restaurant is supposed to know how to make their own food. I ordered The Vegan Cobb salad and not only did it have CHEESE (hello...not vegan) but it had two other items it was NOT supposed to have. Also, it was MISSING 5 major items which made up the bulk of the salad -  almonds, sunflower seeds, quinoa, garbanzo beans, and avocado were all missing. When I called and spoke with the hostess she was really nice but then gave me to the manager, Dandy. Dandy was super inflexible, took no responsibility, did not apologize or offer any compensation just kept saying I had to go through door dash. I was *not asking him to give me my money back* all I wanted was for it to be remade. When I asked him for his name he hung up on me. I called back and called him out on it. He denied it. I finally got his name and the name of his manager - gave me the CEO of Cheesecake Factory - David Overton... don't tell me you don't have a manager besides the CEO geez.

Our server was completely apologetic but I felt like we had to ask for everything! This is only for the service.... Now for the kitchen: it took about 45 mins for our food to come out. We waited so long that the booth behind us had 2 different parties that had come and gone. Also, My friend that got spilled on ordered orange chicken with extra vegetables and white rice. Our server wrote it down right but the kitchen plated it without rice. My other friend ordered carne asada medallions with rice... her poor plate had 3 chunks of meat on it... it looked like the saddest plate in the world! If you're hungry, don't order that!

Tonight I called my dinner order in (Fish N Chips and the Spicy Chicken Sandwich with Fries) and was told it would be ready in 20 minutes. I arrived about 20 minutes later and called to let them know I had arrived to pick up my order. The person who answered (Silvia) transferred me over to the to go section. I waited on hold for 14 minutes and not one person picked up that line. I hung up and then called back. Silvia answered again and I let her know I waited on hold for about 15 minutes to let them know that I was there to pick up my order. She said they were busy and she would let them know I was there. Another 20 minutes went by and still no one had brought our food out. I called back and Silvia answered again...I explained it had be close to 1 hour since I made my order and had been waiting for my order for 40 minutes. She apologized and said she would let them know. 5 minutes later a server came out to our truck with the receipt for our order to collect payment before he brought out our food. I told him I was really frustrated because it had been an hour since I called in my ordered and I was originally told it would be about 20 minutes. I told him I had been waiting in my car for 40 minutes and have called 3 times to let them know I was there for my order. The server was baffled that I had called 3 times and proceeded to tell me that they JUST NOW told him we were there to pick up our order. He told me he would go get a manager to speak to me. A few minutes later he came back out with our food and a manager. I explained my frustration about the situation and asked her if my food had been sitting in there the whole time. Neither the manager or the server knew how long our food was sitting out from. I told her that we had ordered fish N chips and that is not something that should be sitting out for a period of time if that was the case. She said she was going to take care of our charges and said I have your food here now for you. We really just wanted our food and wanted to get home. The worst part is that when we got home and pulled the food out nothing was edible. The fries were cold and hard as rocks, his fish was soggy and cold, my chicken sandwich was hard and cold.

Usually, there is a line outside when I drive by on weekends, but it was a weekday, so not too busy. There was a 10 minute wait, but that wasn't bad, considering I've waited way too long at other restaurants that weren't worth the wait. Our servers were friendly and I got a birthday song. Also got a complimentary sundae with a candle! The food was delicious and left us all stuffed. Which saddened me because if you're visiting here, you want to taste the cheesecake. I couldn't eat any there, but bought two pieces to enjoy at home. I've only had a forkful of the key lime cheesecake and I can see why this place is so popular. Was a bit pricy, but less than $100 for 3 people and extra cheesecake is pretty nice.  Only thing that was bad was a friend of mine ordered a burger well done, but she got it rare.

1569,Ginny L.,"South San Francisco, United States",161,6,2.0,1.0,2017-12-06,"I've always remembered Cheesecake Factory for their good food and good customer service but for my experience, this one had neither.  First off, our waiter was kinda cold if I may say. He asked what drinks he could get for us and looked quite impatient while my boyfriend was looking through the menu since we had just sat down. He ended up just getting a water since he noticed that the waiter looked irritated. He then came back and mumbled ""can I start you guys off with some bread and butter?"" I could barely hear what he said and my boyfriend couldn't hear at all and it's not like it was extra loud in there.  Food wise, my boyfriend got the steak Diane and said it was pretty good. I got what I always get: Louisiana chicken pasta. However, mine didn't have much flavor and it was really oily. At other locations, they always come with the block of Parmesan cheese right when they bring me my plate of pasta but this one didn't. It didn't bother me much until it took me over 5 mins to flag down a waiter/waitress for some cheese (we were sitting in an area where waiters and waitresses were coming and going so 5 mins was kinda pushing it). Food did come fast but our appetizer came like 10 mins after our main courses and what we had ordered was literally grilled cheese with a piece a bacon so idk why it took so long lol.  As for service the rest of the night, we never saw our waiter again. It wasn't even him who brought us our food. No one came by to ask how we were doing. We had to wait over 20 mins just to ask for boxes for our food and for the check. However, the lady who did help us at the end with the boxes and check seemed pretty friendly and was the type of customer service I was used to seeing at a Cheesecake Factory.  We tipped really little (didn't even want to tip tbh) and that's coming from people who always tip, even at little snack and drink places.  Tldr; love Cheesecake Factory, just not this one. Will prob not be coming back",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=100,2.68,3.01,3.044,2.2760000000000002,2.8779999999999997
143,Romeo S.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,1.0,1.0,2017-12-06,"Let me start off by stating that I love this place and my review is based on an experience we recently had. I must state that I do work in the same complex as these guys so I am more favorable of my opinions towards this place, but not this time. However, We see the same security walk and drive by daily. We park behind the green lines everyday. So if the server who helped us had come into our store, knowing he worked closed by, we would ensure his experience was nothing less than exceptional. This server had a condescending demeanor about him. He did not come by for a while and when we waived him down we had to practically beg for more water. In doing so, he rolled his eyes, walked away and returned with a slam on our table with more water. I am so perplexed to how he is in customer service. No one should be treated as if they were less than a human, especially not in a professional environment. Our horrific experience has tainted our impression on this once great location which has now forced us to do our monthly meetings at another restaurant in the complex. So who was responsible for this horrendous behavior that it has forced me to write such a review? The demonic servers name is Luis M. And if you are punished by receiving him as your server, run and run fast.

91,Monica P.,"Sacramento, CA",168,21,6.0,2.0,2017-12-06,I usually come here just for drinks at happy hour but tonight I went in for a late dinner. I understand that they close at 11pm I didn't think coming In at 9:45pm would upset them . The server Luis m. Wasnt so happy with us at all throughout the whole entire night . I ordered the tomato basil pasta which was good and a good portion my friend ordered the enchiladas which was okay wasn't that great. After dinner we ordered 5 desserts To go 2 tiramisu cales 1 key lime pie 1 mango key lime and a salted caramel cheesecake. Although the server only came back with all but the salted caramel which I just let it go cause while waiting for the check I managed to finish the mango key lime pie (couldn't resist). The tiramisu cakes didn't look at all appealing therefore I returned it requesting for one that would look edible like the other desserts I got. And keep in mind I have ordered the tiramisu dessert before. He returned it back with the same exact cakes and this time the cakes were worst and it was just a mess in the box. So I walked over and ask politely to take it off my bill I didn't expect him to holler over to the pastry workers to point out Im the one who decline to his cake. I was in shocked I could not believe this server Luis m. Would point out loud and clear in front of me that I am the person who doesn't want the desserts.. I will think twice about coming back.

But a few days ago, I had a pretty frustrating experience. I got in line at the bakery to pay for my pre-ordered cheesecake. Once I got to the register, I was told I had to pay for it at a different register in the front. Given, there was an 8×11 hand written piece of paper stating that is where we pay for it, but unless you really stop to read everything you won't see it. So I went to pay for it, went back to the other register to make sure they saw my receipt and order and then waited. Understanding it was Christmas Eve day i figured it would take a while but more than 30 minutes go by and everyone who paid after me had already left. I went to ask about it and got my cheesecake within less than 5 minutes. Their explanation for the delay: there were 2 of the same cheesecakes sitting out there for a while with no names on it so no one did anything about it. Next time, put a sign where it's visible to everyone standing in line so they know not to pay there and if theres food/dessert sitting out for a while then figure out where it goes.

70,Sam T.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,1,,1.0,2017-12-27,"I am usually very patient when it comes to waiting for food and to-go orders, especially when it is very busy. But a few days ago, I had a pretty frustrating experience. I got in line at the bakery to pay for my pre-ordered cheesecake. Once I got to the register, I was told I had to pay for it at a different register in the front. Given, there was an 8×11 hand written piece of paper stating that is where we pay for it, but unless you really stop to read everything you won't see it. So I went to pay for it, went back to the other register to make sure they saw my receipt and order and then waited. Understanding it was Christmas Eve day i figured it would take a while but more than 30 minutes go by and everyone who paid after me had already left.

I called to set up a reservation for dinner and I was told it's a first come first serve... I live an hour away, and the people I have invited live even further. My guests agreed to dinner here because they know I love this place, but to have to come hours early just so I can get a table before everyone else is ridiculous. I will always return because like I said I love this place but they need to make things easier on people who live further away that are visiting their establishment.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=20,3.12,2.98,3.024,,3.0360000000000005

1182,Parker H.,"Santa Cruz, United States",0,6,2.0,1.0,2017-12-29,Worst burger I've ever had plus shitty service. Started off ordered a burger and added cheese to it. I was patiently waiting for my burger and was wondering where the hot bread was and never received it. I haven't been here in a while so I thought they stopped serving it but noticed on other tables around me that they had bread. So sitting there starving with just water at the table about 20 minutes goes by which isn't bad my burger comes out and it has lettuce and tomato on one side of the bun and the burger on the other side which looks like a piece of charcoal just burnt with NO CHEESE. I flagged down the waitress told her that the burger didn't have cheese and she said the burger I ordered doesn't come with cheese and I specifically added cheese to the original order which she forgot I did and remembered when I reminded her. She walks away I continue to eat my fries and my dried up burger that no one wants even at a BBQ just sitting there waiting for cheese finally the waitress brings out a slice of cheese on a hot plate that's partially melted to the plate and have to peel it off and put it on my cold burger that's been sitting there for a good 15 minutes and my fries were gone in the process of waiting. So instead of getting a new hot burger she gave me a flimsy piece of Macdonald's cheese to put on a cold burger. I was so hungry I ate it anyway and it was completely disgusting had no flavor and was cold and burnt. After I ate the nasty burger they brought out bread I mean really ? Too little too late. My girlfriend gave a one dollar tip which I told her to put 0 but her pasta dish was okay. I'm sorry but Cheesecake Factory sucks the service sucks and the food is over priced. The only reason why I went there is because of a gift card we had. I can make a burger 1000 times better than the piece of burnt bs I had. I definitely won't be going back. Terrible,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=60,2.88,2.94,2.98,,2.916
