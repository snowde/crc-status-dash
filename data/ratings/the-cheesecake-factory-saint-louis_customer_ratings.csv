86,Mina I.,"Chicago, IL",570,150,154.0,3.0,2012-01-11,"This is your typical chain restaurant but I actually enjoy coming here for a meal or even just to get a dessert. They have a huge assortment in regards to their menu; such as over 9 different varieties of salads (I love their Cobb and caesar salad), different types of proteins, many to choose from their appetizers (I love their Mac and cheese bites), burgers (I just ate their bacon cheeseburger with fries last night - very juicy and delicious), and of course, their many assortments of cheesecake! I for one love to indulge in their red velvet, snickers and their Godiva chocolate cheesecake.

Right sized (for me anyway) and as a person who has never been fond of sandwiches or salads oozing with dressings to the point I have to dig through to find the salad or meat, having a sandwich now with a small enough amount to satisfy me - I'm good to go!  And if it isn't enough that's what asking for a bit more on the side is for.

63,Tim G.,"O'Fallon, IL",72,65,539.0,2.0,2012-01-27,"Obviously, there's not much I can say about The Cheesecake Factory, that hasn't already been said.  This place is a family favorite, especially for birthdays!  Our most recent trip however (25 Jan 12), fell a bit short of what I have come to expect (and love) about TCF.  Typically, I'd give TCF a 4-star rating.  But on this occasion, 2.5 at best. Let's walk through this chronologically... after being seated, our waiter took our drink order.  I asked what kind of single-malt Scotch they had, the waiter was clueless.  I asked him to please ask the bartender for a Scoth list.  No harm... I ultimately ended up ordering one of my favorites, an Oban.  However, it was brought to me in a brandy snifter!  Don't like drinks not properly served!   The Cheesecake Factory is known for it's liberal appetizers!  In most cases, the appetizer is usually enough to satisfy a moderate appetite.  I must assume the economy crunch and rising price of food has severely impacted TCF's ability to serve these appetizers, at a moderate price.  All of the appetizers we ordered were small quantities/size.  No longer a value for the price paid.  Just skip the appetizer and go straight to the entree! All of the entrees were fine, not remarkable, but fine.  My daughter ordered the Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp (her favorite).  Unfortunately, half-way though her meal, she found a hair on her plate.  Her meal ended there!  Now I realize, occasionally, things like this happen in every restaurant.  Not that they should, but the plain fact is they do.  But the damage is usually mitigated by the staff's response.  The waiter immediately brought it to the attention of the manager, who promptly came to the table, apologized, and offered to do whatever was necessary to make it right.  That's the response I expect, and that made the occurance less unpleasant.   My other daughter, who was celebrating her birthday, had the New Orleans Shrimp.  She liked it, but to me, it seemed to be a bit scarce on the shrimp/sausage.  This was hidden by an exorbitant amount of white rice (enought to feed the whole family) used to fill in far too much empty space on the plate!  My son had the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta and seemed to really enjoy it.  I had the Hibachi Steak.  Not bad, but way over-priced for the small cut of beef.  The shiitake mushroom/bean sprout/onion topping was exceptional, though!  It was accompanyed by tempura-battered asparagus.  That was incredible.  Unfortunately, it only came with two spears.  All things considered, our entrees were, well, satisfying. Dinner was rounded out with what else?  Cheesecake!  I mean why go there and not have cheescake for dessert.  Right?  The plethora of choices and trying to decide on which cheescake to have, is part of the fun.  Call me unadventurous, but I always get the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut!  It's my favorite, and in my mind the best!  But that's always a matter of personal opinion.  All of the cheesecake here is exceptional!  It happened to be my daughter's birthday.  The waiter brought her cheescake to the table with a candle.  It was beautifully presented with the words ""happy birthday"" written on the plate's border in chocolate syrup.  Nice. So, in the end, I'd characterize this visit to TCF as fine.  I'm disappointed in the reduction in portion size, though, as this has always been part of the TCF's niche.   I think I left this as a tip, but always do the 30-minute call-ahead seating.  Oh, BTW, they did remove my daughter's entree (the one with the hair), from the bill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-saint-louis?start=160,3.48,3.48,3.48,3.1120000000000005,3.4800000000000004

I love the ""romantic"" atmosphere with the dimmed lights and the cozy tables.  If I have to say something negative I do think they cram too many tables into the areas and that you sit too close to your neighbors if you're not in a booth.  Not always comfortable but it does allow more people in the establishment.

It's pretty bad to walk out in the dark into this parking lot, esp. if it's raining and if you arrived at a busy time for the neighboring businesses and had to park far away.

I have several issues with this establishment.  First, the seating arrangements.  You are either allowed to sit in an incredibly uncomfortable booth, or you are allowed to sit at an incredibly uncomfortable table with the next table practically in your lap.  The tables are so close that a guest at the table next to ours knocked our pepper shaker off of our table with his behind while he was squeezing between the tables. My second issue, is the music.  If the music is so loud, that even when yelling at the server they cannot hear you, it might be an indication that the music is too loud.  Just my thoughts. The food the last two times was just ""meh"".  This last time, mine was way too salty, and the time before that, my friend had to return his dish because it was even saltier than mine.   Admittedly, I have not tried the desert; the main course discouraged me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-saint-louis?start=180,3.52,3.52,3.52,3.0480000000000005,3.5200000000000005

He presented as that not being on option and then insisted that I just eat the shrimp because it would still be vegetarian despite me not even saying I was a vegetarian. I could have very well been allergic to shrimp, but that didn't seem to matter as he was annoyed by my order and made it clear when he rolled his eyes at me.

Not so. There is actually very little that is naturally gluten free (think steak or steamed fish with none of their sides) and even less that can be modified. I am told all of their dressings have wheat in it. They also have added wheat somehow to their rice and beans (say what?? Why on earth you need to...). I finally ended up getting a Cobb salad with a steamed chicken ( the seasoning they usually  use has wheat) and a very boring oil and vinegar dressing.

Still,  the small size also has a small price. It is a nice appetizer to share with another person. As for my meal, I actually decided to go with the Cuban sandwich, as I didn't want anything heavy. While the sandwich is not authentic Cuban, it was good. They state that is was made with Cuban-style role, but it isn't. The texture of a Cuban-style roll is smooth, while this roll was very coarse. Also, it came with mayo which is something not on a traditional Cuban. Therefore, just ask for the mayo on the side if you want something closer to an authentic Cuban (as I just used my mayo to do my Utah-style fry sauce). But still, the lack of being authentic didn't take away from the flavor, which was absolutely amazing.

I like the fact that the menus are large enough that both Sean & I can find things we like on them. I noticed they have a new ""skinnylicious"" menu (retarded name, IMHO) and honestly nothing sounded too good from it. It didn't help that they had to put the word ""skinnylicious"" in front of every fucking thing. (I am gonna keel over if I have to type that word one more time, rofl.) But I opted for the regular menu and strategically planned to only eat 1/2 of whatever I ordered so that I wouldn't have a massive stomachache and need to consume extra prescription drugs to manage my problems which ensue later.  I have always loved their herb encrusted salmon but I wanted to try their steak diane. To my delight/surprise they had both of these items available as 1 entree so you can try both. The salmon comes in a (very) buttery herb sauce and the steak comes in a mushroom-y steak sauce with onions. A wall of mashed potatoes separates the surf n' turf. The salmon was 100% perfect, loved it. The steak (medium rare) wasn't bad either but it was definitely a tiny bit chewy...not exactly filet mignon but hey whatevs. I think the dish cost about $19, which ain't bad for steak and salmon. Sean had a burger (as usual) and enjoyed it until he realized the bun had been grilled with practically a stick of butter. Urp. The dessert menu is freakin' massive, but I am not really a huge fan of cheesecake unless it's the plain, original kind (uh oh my inner Sean comes out!) although white chocolate raspberry cheesecake is pretty amazing too. Protip, though, if all you like is their original cheesecake, you can get it at Red Robin for cheaper, I am pretty sure, b/c they started selling it there a few months ago. ;) Linda's fudge cake at the Cheesecake Factory is pretty flippin' fantastic, but I am scared to look up the calorie content. Since I had opted for a glass of wine that night, I decided to pass on the dessert calories. But still, can't help but to drool at the case on my way out. I wish they'd open one of these in St. Charles....

After we declined bread, she brought a bread basket anyway and disappeared. We waited a very l-o-n-g time to have our order taken, and then we waited 1/2 hour for our food. Unfortunately, things got worse. An overpriced order of Vietnamese shrimp and shiitake mushroom spring rolls was badly prepared. The real joy was that the dish contained ONE shrimp and ONE mushroom among the three rolls. The rest was shredded carrots and noodles! We tried to get someone's attention to send our food back, but it was useless. Our waitress was completely overwhelmed; the  ""manager"" was busy sweeping up broken glass. We thought things would improve with dessert, and we were wrong. Cheesecake with an upcharge for strawberries arrived with TWO small berries served in a shot glass on the plate. There was no strawberry sauce and no sweetener, but some wildly creative slicing to make the tiny glass appear full.

Shrimp were in a cream and salt sauce and the shrimp were breaded and fried. Salt on salt on salt. The chicken was decent, nothing spectacular.

When my buffalo tenders came out sans the buffalo, I still said nothing. I ordered a side dipping sauce so that the server wouldn't get in trouble.

So, we didn't have to wait long for a table. Maybe five or ten minutes and we were seated. The place where we sat was outside on the patio and it was near the door. We could hear the door opening and slamming shut, but that was the only negative aspect of our experience. There were so many choices in the menu, it was very difficult to make a decision on what to eat. I eventually chose their chicken and biscuits entree and my dining partner chose an enchilada. The prices were a bit steep, but you get a lot on your plate. We ended up eating half of what was on our plates and taking the rest home. My partner ordered one enchilada, but that thing was so massive, you'd think some Mexican giant dropped down from some bean stalk and made it for us. Yes, it was huge. We had to have cheesecake, because, why go to a cheesecake restaurant without having their dessert? I had Adam's Peanut butter cheesecake, which didn't disappoint either.

This gives me a little more understanding of the processes of addressing issues.  That being said.... My wife and I sat at a High Top at the bar. It was empty at the time so no need to wait for the hostess to sit us. 5 minutes after sitting down we got our drinks and placed our order. We both got the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic. When I was an employee I got hooked, and hooked my wife as well. Normally I would recommend this dish. This time :20 passed and the food runner came out and said that she dropped one of them. She said that they were firing a new one on a fly and offered to bring out the one that was ready. My wife was totally ready so I said to bring it on out. I know that this dish fly time is 5 minutes, so I would not have to sit there too long with no food. I understand that things like this happens and if they fixed it in due time I would have been satisfied.  When the first dish was brought to us it looked odd. It was very wet and the bowl was wiped bad. My wife stirred it up and I said we will kick it back. The cooks put extra cream in the bowl so it could sit in the window while they did the re-cook. Yeah, that is not the way to do it. So, now we have 2 re-cooks. :25 passed and we only seen our server once and the food runner once. At the :25 mark we went to the host desk and asked for the MOD.  Patrick, the MOD, came up and spoke to us. He tried the excuse that they are busy and it could take time for a re-cook. I asked him how long and he said :15 or maybe longer. I asked him again, and it was the same. I then let him know that I worked the first 4 years and that I opened Birmingham, AL unit as a trainer. I let him know that the dish re-cook should have been  5 minutes and if the station was fully loaded no more than :10. He then agreed. He did offer to bring the dishes out to us, but we only had 30 minutes left on date night. He packed it up and comp'd the meal.

The bread is awesome, specifically the honey wheat brown bread! So good! The service is typically not bad. The prices are kind of high for the entrees ($10 - $20) and the cheesecakes (around $8 - $10 per slice), however they do offer a pretty nice lunch menu. The portions are large so expect left overs. My top pics: crusted chicken romano, godiva cheesecake, factory burger, old fashioned burger, santa fe salad, hersheys chocolate bar cheesecake, and key lime cheesecake.

They offer a sizable menu with servings bigger than your stomach can hold. Most of the time, I skip the appetizer because I usually can't even manage to finish my main course. However, I have tried some of their delicious apps (crispy cuban rolls and stuffed potato tots) and have enjoyed them tremendously! They usually start you off with some bread which I always skip. The dinning room is quite large as to accomodate enough people so there is minimal wait time (unless of course, you come here at a very busy time).  The service in general very consistent and on the good side. Sadly, they got rid of one of my favorite menu items which was the chicken katsu but they do still have my other favorite: the shepherd's pie.

This is the place you go when you have multiple indecisive eaters with you as they can pretty much satisfy any palatte with their 30 page menu. Im not going into too much detail because this place has been around for quite a while and if you havent been here before, it's def worth a try.  One of my fav small plates are the chicken samosas. They have changed the recipe since ive had it last and let me say that it was for the better. I love the new filling... now if they would just fill up the cup with the cilantro sauce that would be amazing, i mean the thing only holds like two tbsp anyways, why so stingy???  One of my favorite entrees is the chicken picata. I've actually not had good chicken picata that ive absolutely loved from even italian restaurants that taste better than theirs. I usually have to put salt and pepper on it which is fine but this time it was a little salty. They used way more capers than usual and didnt have a lot of extra sauce to go with the ton of angel hair pasta they give you. Someone else prob would have sent it back but a little excess salt doesnt bother me too much and i also like capers. My cousin had the fried shrimp platter which in all of my years of going to CF's no one has ever ordered it but those shrimp were huge! And cooked to perfection. The mac and cheese was pretty good too. My bf had meatloaf, he liked it but I wasnt impressed by it.  The food was great however service was def lacking here. Our waiter was so not attentive. We had to flag him down for everything. He not once just stopped through unless he was dropping something off. Not only that, our food was slow to come as well. I had ordered a bowl of alfredo pasta for my one year old to come out before our meals and it took forever. Once i asked the waiter about it, he went and got it and i could tell it had been sitting under a heat lamp for a long time as the pasta on top was a little dried out. One thing that never disappoints at CF's is the cheesecake. Thats the only thing ive found to be extremly consistent nationwide although i can say that most of their foods taste the same.

It was simply all piled on the table and we were left unattended until we were ready to check out. Finally, the manager was unable to follow our directions to split the check 9 ways for about a half hour and it still ended up being incorrect!  The manager commented that it was ""crazy to split the check"". If a restaurant manager does not know how to split cost 9 ways with a simple math, then he is quite simply incompetent. All in all I would never go back to this place for a dinner again.

Completely grossed me out. Then the food comes out... and it was nowhere near hot. It was strange to me to eat room temperature pasta that JUST got brought to us.  The second time, my burger wasn't like the menu said it would be. I got the BBQ burger. I didn't get onion straws, I got just plain onions, then it said it would have a BBQ ranch, had nothing on it, just plain BBQ on the side... and the fries were awful. Cold and were probably made an hour prior to being served to us. And my sons pasta had hardly any sauce on it and was cold. Not even being dramatic about that, it was cold. On top of the food that just wasn't good... our server was mia a lot. Being a waitress myself, this bothered me. She even noticed my son and I barely touched our food and didn't ask for a box... and didn't care.

As a result, I highly recommend taking advantage of the call ahead seating. The other thing that the hosts are not great at letting patrons know is that the high top tables in the bar area are open seating and full service. This has been useful to me on more than one occasion. Your level of service here will vary wildly based on the busyness of the restaurant and section you are seated in, but overall it's ok. I tend to order their pastas, and usually go with the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. It's spicy and delicious and comes with bow tie noodles. The  bread they bring to the table while you are waiting for your food is yummy. They obviously they offer a number of Cheesecake varieties, but I tend to go with the original and usually get it to go. They also have a lighter fare menu if you've got friends who want something a little healthier. You can do curbside pick up at this location, which I feel like is somewhat unique in the StL restaurant scene. If you're going to choose a chain restaurant, CF is as good as they come in my opinion.
