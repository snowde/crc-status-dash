We ordered drinks including wine and they came to the table promptly.  We then placed our orders.  Ten minutes later the waitress comes back to inform my niece they just ran out of the small lunch pizza she ordered and said she could order the larger dinner version but it would cost more and would not come with salad.  What does this mean!  Two things come to mind:  1. if the really cared about us they would have just brought the bigger pizza after our disastrous seating experience,  2. that obviously they are serving frozen prepackaged food - otherwise if they had dough to make a large pizza then why would they not have the same dough to make a small pizza! The wait - it was over an hour after my niece graciously said she we would have something else off the menu that our food came and over 1.5 hours after we were seated before we were served!  No drink refills (we had to ask). The disaster!  We had a small catastrophe before we were served in that an ice tea glass was knocked over and broke and glass and ice tea were everywhere.  We managed to clean it up the best we could but sat there in broken glass and tea all over the place with no assistance (although two employees acknowledged the breakage - but did not assist - other than handing us a towel).  We piled up the larger pieces of glass and ice on a spare plate with the towel.  The waitress never took away the mess and we sat and had to eat our lunch in broken glass and water.  She took our lunch plates away but never took the mess away nor called for assistance.   Bottom line!  NEVER AGAIN!  The worst service ever!  Mediocre prepackaged food, long waits and totally insulting experience!   Shame on you Cheesecake Factory!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-salt-lake-city-2?start=200,2.5320000000000005,2.5320000000000005,2.5320000000000005,2.5320000000000005,2.5320000000000005

I enjoyed the cold summer rolls which contained shrimp and asparagus in a rice wrapper as an appetizer. I ordered Sheila's cashew chicken salad (lunch size) and it turned out to be a very large portion. I wish they used more salad dressing, but the quality of chicken strips was very fresh and tasty. I liked the amount of cashews in the dish. My husband ordered two excellent alcoholic beverages--a mai tai was his favorite as it was large and boozy. The second drink, a margarita, was ok but the mixer tasted of artificial lime powder. I enjoyed a strawberry lemonade, which was decent, but nothing special. My husband's entree, the lunch-sized shepherd's pie was too salty. Tasted like it was made with french onion soup mix.

However the service was horrible the server was not pleasant and she didn't do any efforts to make it better, so we decided to drive a bit further and to go to Murray, however tonight we needed to go to city creek  and I was craving for cheesecake factory.

I got one of the Skinnylicious Salads on the supplemental menu and it was loaded with yummy beets, asparagus, goat cheese and healthy options. I was going to get the skinny balsamic too but the server brought my husband his ranch dressing early and I had to taste it. It had a stronger that usual garlic flavor, obviously homemade and was fantastic on my salad.  Hubby got the Skinnylicious Turkey and Avocado sandwich and he loved it! My daughter ordered the bowties, butter and Parmesan which she practically inhaled. From the fresh, soft bread to the end of the meal, it was all terrific. We unfortunately left no room for the actual dessert but that was okay.

The bottom of the sandwhich was burnt black. So we sent it back. After waiting about ten minutes the new one comes out. Still burnt on the bottom but just a little bit better than the first. Still burnt though! Like seriously?! We were waiting for a new sandwhich so not only did they burn it again, but they could have taken it off the press and we could have gotten it faster as well and we would have been a lot happier. They didn't take the sandwhich off the bill, but I disputed it. First of all, the second sandwhich came out burnt again and we waited 10 minutes. Second, the manager never came to apologize. Third, they wanted to charge us and the waiter got all snarky when we wanted to talk to a manager about it. They ended up taking the sandwhich off but they were rude about it. Also, he said he took off the ""first"" sandwhich just not the second. He's all, ""so we took off one sandwhich now you want two sandwhiches taken off?"" it's like uhh we should have never had two to begin with if the cooks made it right the first time. So we order one sandwhich not two. A remake of a horrible sandwhich does not count as two? And if the second sandwhich that came out after 10 minutes of waiting was yummy and perfect -NOT BURNT AGAIN- then we would have nooo problem paying! But $13 for a sandwhich that came back bad again?

But I can't be against something that is legitimately good, and tasty, and SO MUCH FOOD IN A PLATE. Their location first of all is gold, with not only perfect downtown location, but also in the City Creek Mall. Good deal to go there after shopping, or walking around downtown. Their service is always great. Their food is always well prepared, and always impressing with their cheesecakes, which truly are a joy to any human being that likes cheesecake (Which should be everyone). I love their nachos with the chicken. The presentation for the nachos is great, but the flavor, the texture... the toppings...! the actual chips!!! Thick and crunchy, but not annoying. Great Guacamole, jalapenos, cheese, creamy cheese, onions. sour cream... and the chicken. SHIIIIIIIII. The chicken is so well made. Perfect seasoning, perfect texture... ahh... I'm pretty in love with these nachos. One nice disclosure: They do not validate parking for City Creek. So don't expect to get your parking paid. They do have a good valet system right beside the restaurant. Also, lots of seating, and nice outside seating too. Chessecake Factory is always a safe choice, since their menu is HUGE. And their quality is pretty good for the most part. But it's not a magical local experience. Or an organic heaven. It's a multistate establishment, like chili's and restaurants of that sort, with a bigger menu and ""nicer"" food. ALSO, I would definitely stay away from their lemonades/limeades. They are extremely terrible. But that's it.

This location was another fine example of the well-developed Cheesecake Factory brand.  The location of this restaurant was great, right in the middle of the pretty shopping mall and the restaurant itself had beautiful high ceilings and low ambient lighting. We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table, but the weather was nice and we enjoyed a bench near the fountain.  Our server was a top-notch professional who quickly greeted us and took our drink order. Thankfully, we know how large their portions are and skipped ordering an appetizer. Unfortunately, they ran out of salmon so I couldn't enjoy my favorite Miso Salmon dinner, but I stepped outside my comfort zone and was pleasantly surprised by the Oven Baked Herb & Lemon Chicken. I would've preferred a green vegetable instead of cooked carrots but the Mashed potatoes were yummy and our drinks from the bar were really good too. After dinner, I decided to splurge and order the Strawberry Shortcake a la mode and a cup of coffee. I expected a moist slice of cake but it was more like a biscuit topped with berries, whipped cream and ice cream. The cake was a little on the dry/hard side but still yummy. Perhaps I should've stuck with cheesecake, Lol.  This is where things got bad, hence the 3-star rating. I added the cream and sugar to my coffee and used my unused spoon to stir it up. I then took a sip of coffee from the spoon and licked it, only to discover with my tongue, chunks of dried food on the spoon!!!! YUCK!!! I politely told the server about my surprise discovery and his reaction was honest and professional. He acknowledged the problem and immediately apologized. I asked for a new coffee and he promptly returned with one, along with the manager who also apologized and offered anything to rectify the situation. I'm really not one to try and get free stuff or discounts unless something is really really bad, so I just accepted the apology and finished my coffee. The server returned and once again apologized, and seemed visibly upset about the whole situation. He said that if it were him, he wouldn't have been as nice as I was.  He returned with the bill and said that he just couldn't accept my reluctance to ask for compensation, and in order for him to feel good about it, he insisted on at least comping the dessert. What a nice gesture.  We enjoyed our dinner and the truly professional level of customer service from the server and management, but I guess the dish washing and table setting staff members need to pay closer attention to their jobs.

Her attitude was not the nicest, but this is to be expected when your 32 weeks and assigned to a party of 40. Clearly my heart went out to her b/c she simply she was struggling. The other waiter seemed overwhelmed and you could tell immediately he was not up for the task. He was all over the place. The drinks, food, checks got mixed up and at the end he was just so rude and not once apologized for all the mixed up. Finally it was dessert time and when  the dessert came out it was placed in a togo box without our request, we knew that was a hint. Lol! Thankfully everyone had a good time and didn't care about the crappy service we received or the empty drinks that were never refilled, or the snappy waitress who looked like she just wanted her baby out NOW.

True, it's pretty dang expensive ($15-30 per person, not including drinks or dessert) and the wait is often bad but the quality of food has made it worth it on special occasions. The chicken and biscuits are my favorite, but also loved the steak diane and shepherd's pie. (Get something with mashed potatoes, because they're great here. And trust me, that is not a recommendation I usually make.) There are SO many choices, I'm not sure you can go wrong. Well no, I take that back. Though I haven't had anything bad, the artichoke dip and raspberry lemonades were both forgettable. The main dishes, however, have yet to disappoint. Portion sizes are massive and your caloric intake will be through the roof, so plan on getting a doggy bag.  I'm not typically a fan of cheesecake (which is bizarre, since this place is called the Cheesecake Factory) but this place does it right. I honestly just stick to the original, plain jane cheesecake, so I can't vouch for the others, but it was really good. (The first time I got it, an employee scoffed at me for not being more adventurous and it was kind of rude, but that was an anomaly in otherwise pleasant service.)  My only other complaint is that it's pretty dark in there. The guy next to me was using his cell phone as a light to be able to read the menu.

However, this place is always packed, so I recommend you to avoid their busy hours. I went here on a Saturday noon, waited for about 10 min for the table. What I don't like about this place is that the space between each table. It seems to me it's getting narrower each time I came here. The service were pretty slow that day, it seemed our waiter had forgotten us from time to time. That's why I didn't give it the fourth star.  I got the lunch pasta-Evelyn's Favorite, and lunch favorites- Famous Factory Meatloaf. The pasta was a bit tasteless at first, without chewing with the sundries tomatoes, it was flavorless. The meatloaf was enjoyable. It was tender and perfectly seasoned and cooked. I love how they put onion on top of the meatloaf to bring out even more flavor. We ended our meal with the Limoncello Cheesecake. It wasn't as sweet as the other. I always think that their cheesecakes were too sweet, but this one was unlike the rest, it had a freshness taste in it.

I was absolutely appalled that he would do that, when I called the manager she was not pleasant either. I am not a very hard person to please, but the way the entire situation was handled was a complete joke. Not only what he did was illegal but it was almost worse how the manager dealt with it.

120,Megan C.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,3,,2.0,2015-07-18,"Went there with my husband for our 1st year anniversary...definitely not the greatest impression for my first time at any Cheesecake Factory. It started out ok because as for any nice restaurant on a Saturday night we had to wait about 25 mins to be seated. Our primary waiter was nice & took our beverage order & followed though in giving us time before coming back while we decide on an appetizer & any other beverages we may like. It all went down hill as soon as the server who brought us our appetizer came by. The table was really small for 2ppl & it was already crowed from our large menus & bread basket & two side plates. This particular server, whom I didn't catch the name of, was obviously in a rush & discourteous as he kept telling me to move the items around to accommodate the large platter so he could put it down. He even was telling my husband to move the items as well. I was trying to tell him that without sweeping the plates & beer bottle off the table that I had no where else to put the items id already stacked & scooted to the side. He hastily plopped the platter down & took off, but not before I had asked him to take the beer bottle to toss as I didn't want to accidentally knock it off & shatter it. He yanked it out of my hand & said, ""yeah, it's that kind of a night."" I work in customer service & that was just uncalled for! When our original waiter came around to take our order we placed our order to go- he was a bit surprised. We explained we did not want to spend our anniversary in an already crowded place if we were just going to be treated like that. My husband said that in the many times he'd been there he's never had service such as that. The manager was informed & very apologetic & even went as far as paying for our entrees and getting us dessert. I appreciated our original waiter & the manager, Tyler. I feel bad that one servers customer service skills were lacking & that it effected the waiter, so we left a small tip anyhow.  Overall it was a sad evening for dining out. Too small of tables, too loud & crowded & the menu is SO big that it takes quite some time to review & decide- it has way too many options. And they really should accept reservations on the weekend.

This was Wednesday, 09/09/2015. my boyfriend and i went there around 5pm, the restaurant had some customers but not like dinner hours packed. Let's just start off with the server. We got a guy server, after we ordered our drinks and food he never came back to us for good 10-15 minutes. then a lady showed up say she's gonna be our server. I asked her to bring us some fresh bread because the ones that the pervious server brought to us was bit cold and hard to chew. She started to ""explain"" (in a harsh tone): "" all our bread are like that, i mean i could if you really want to but it's gonna be the same."" i was like, ""the bread is very hard and i would like to have some fresh ones. please do so."" She said, "" okay fine, i will bring you some!"" seriously, your job is to bring what customers want, not to argue with me how i want my bread!! Then we got our food, till we finished our food, she never come by refill water/check on us/ anything. few minutes after we finished, she brought us the dessert menu but we decided to just skip it and asked her to bring us the check. When my boyfriend got the check, he asked me, "" please tell me what does she mean?!"" he handed me the bill, the server circled the tips section and wrote a big ""thank you!"" right next to it. we both felt confused and uncomfortable, ""who would just circle the tips section? for what? to tell/ remind us that we need to tip her????""  so my boyfriend went to talk to the manager, the manager of that night was a hispanic lady, she explained that the server circled it because not everyone knows to pay the tips, they circle tips on every single customers bill. my boyfriend said, "" did you check? because i really don't think she will circle the tips section on American customers' bills."" by the way, my boyfriend and i are both international college students (asians) but i don't think there's any communication/ language barriers that we had with the server or the manager. my boyfriend said to her, "" well this is not a comfortable situation, i felt that she is asking and reminding me for the tips."" The manager just acted like it's not a big deal and said, ""oh sorry you felt offended, i will talk to her. you don't have to pay the tips if you don't want to."" We both live in the US for over 5 years, and this is the first time i learned that ""it's a common thing that servers circle tips section to remind customers to pay the tips."" We left the restaurant that night so upset and pissed, not only because of the server but more the manager.

She was very friendly, funny, didn't have a problem explaining menu items to us newbs, and everything came out quickly, considering the rush.  The food was spectacular. The Steak Diane was probably the best steak dish I've ever had in my life. It was cooked perfectly, the mashed potatoes were AMAZING, and the flavor just can't be duplicated (I've tried, thanks Pinterest). Their coffee is superb as well. I nearly stole my hubby's caramel macchiato because it was THAT good.  Of course, the cheesecake is to die for as well. I mean, it better be, it's the CHEESECAKE factory.

I will just start by saying that for the most part the food is always decently good. I had the best lettuce wraps I have had here one time. I also had one of the worst cheesecake factory salads I have ever had at this location.  But what has been really hot or cold has been the service.  On a recent visit our waitress was hardly a waitress at all. It took over 10 minutes for her to come and introduce herself or give us water. After about another 10 minutes, she came by again and said ""Sorry I don't have any time I have other people I have to help that are very needy"" so... maybe the Queen of England was also there and we were just chopped liver compared to that? Not really sure what that was about because we were paying customers too.  OH WELL. We finally ordered. I ordered a lunch size chicken salad... well they brought out a huge salad and I asked if it was the lunch size and the girl who brought it out assured me that it was the lunch size. Well they forgot the dressing, and it took another 5 minutes to flag down a worker to get dressing. So okay I was a little upset but I got over it. The salad was fine, nothing amazing. I have had better at other locations. Well fast forward to the bills... and they had charged me for a full dinner salad. I told my waitress I only had a lunch, and she said that they gave me a dinner size. I protested and said it was unfair to charge me for something I didn't order. She eventually agreed and only charged me for the lunch size, but it wasn't without a big hassle and without her making me feel like I was the most demanding person in the world. I really just wanted to pay the price for what I ordered. So that experience wasn't good.  BUT the next time I came a few days later, I had one of the nicest workers serving me ever. He was so attentive and checked on me the perfect amount of times. He made sure I always had water and that I had all the things I needed. I had the mushroom chicken lettuce wraps and they were simply delicious, fresh, and a great deal. It was about a 100 times better experience.  OVERALL..... I mean I think the food is pretty good or I wouldn't keep coming back. It isn't the best food ever, but it is open late, and there is a huge menu so it pleases pretty much everyone you come with.

My orders were not complicated. According to my server,  the kitchen failed to adhere to my request for light sour cream on my order.  She stated that not only did they forget, the amount on the order was so much that she ordered me another and the manager comped the item. I did not complain,  or request any accommodation.  I had nothing to do and nowhere to go.  I was enjoying an evening with my daughter who has to have their calamari whenever we see a restaurant and I give the option.  The calamari was extremely salty but she enjoyed.  Back to my situation.  When the check came to the table I was charged twice for the items that were comped but only one item was deducted. Basic math suggests that 2-1=1. The tally for the messed up entree should have been 2-2=0. When I pointed this out,  the waitress promptly engaged in a back and forth that included every thing from the kitchen messed up,  to the manager messed up.  Somewhere in the back and forth this sorry excuse for a hospitality industry employee made the mistake of saying. ""Well you ate it...""  Zero to 100 real quick. Go get your manager.  Somewhere in there,  there was an offer to fix it and an admission that she had made a mistake by not reviewIng the check.  Too late!  You really messed up when you chastised me for eating the dish I came in to purchase that you charged me twice for after extending the offer to comp the item. Sadly the table next to me had a different problem with the quality of her order.  The waitress reordered the dish.  When the waitress looped back around,  the other patron explained she might just be interested in something else.  In a huff the waitresses tells the lady,  to basically make up her mind because if she doesn't want the replacement dish she needs to hurry up and cancel the order she submitted. Thanks a bunch.  On a first time trip to Salt Lake City and the state of Utah,  my daughter and I now have a miserable experience to remember. I tried to use it as a teaching experience. I explained to her that this young lady either was really bad at her job or was really having a bad day.  I went on to share almost by default I tip 20% of the check amount.  In cases where the kitchen messes up I don't penalize the server.  In this case I explained that on the little check we had of $30 and some change I paid $31.

I decided to splurge and get the orange chicken dinner ($16) and Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake ($8).  Service: We had to wait awhile for our whole party to arrive, but our waitress was very patient in filling our drinks and bread while we waited to order. Overall we were there a little over 2 hours - 30 min waiting for our party. About 90 minutes waiting for food, eating, getting to-go boxes, getting the check, and paying. I'm not sure about the procedure for getting to-go boxes. but we all could have done it ourselves. It took awhile for our waitress to package up 6 meals. I think she did fantastic job making sure our drinks were full and checking to see if we needed anything else.  Food: I didn't expect to have 3 meals on my plate.  The chicken was crunchy and flavored fantastically alongside a huge scoop of rice (option of white or brown) and veggies. There was literally 3 servings on my plate. I ate as much as I could that night. Then had it for lunch and dinner the next day! I usually opt for a pasta dish at Cheesecake factory but I heard the Orange Chicken was good so I gave it a try.

227,Nichole D.,"Lehi, UT",126,108,180.0,1.0,2016-04-08,"I am sorry to do this but I feel it has to be said. This was one of my worst dinning experiences I have ever had. My husband and I went to this Cheesecake factory with his parents and man did things go horrible awry. First off, I want to point out that we are big fans of the Fashion Place Cheese Cake Factory (will review later) so we have come to expect a level of service from this franchise. Our dinner started off with an extremely long wait to be seated (to be expected at any Cheese Cake Factory) the major issue was the fact that the restaurant was not very active the night we were there (Sunday). After finally being seated we were shoved into what seemed to be the back of the restaurant. The lighting at our table was extremely dim and we were hardly able to read our menus. All things up to this point were forgivable.  Things went terrible down hill when our two year old son was playing with his drink. The cup he had seemed to lose its integrity as he was drinking it and decided to give way all over the table (not there fault). Dripping with drink we began to try and scramble to find some type of help from the service at the restaurant. This is where our nightmare continued. After many failed attempts at gaining the attention of multipule waiters and waitresses. I decided to ask the help of a waiter and his response was that he would come immediately after he finished the table he was working on. But after completing the table he completely forgot the promise he had made and even after our attempts to draw his attention he acted as if we were invisible. After he left I tracked down a bus boy who finally came and helped us clean up our table. Next, I feel because we were stuffed in the back of the restaurant our waiter seemed to have forgotten about us. He never seemed to come and check in on how things were going and even after we complained about our lack of drinks his remedy was to bring each of us triple drinks to make sure we were satisfied (which took up to much space on our table and created a new problem with our two year old) the best part was he brought us the wrong drinks.  Lastly, the time on the food took an exuberant amount of time longer than expected. Normally I would plan on one hours worth of time but our food took double (solidifying the feeling that we had been forgotten). I know that there is more that I have forgotten but I truly have to give this Cheese Cake Factory a thumbs down. I will not be returning. I recommend you save your money or make the extra drive to Fashion Place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-salt-lake-city-2?start=60,2.96,3.06,3.06,2.34,3.0200000000000005

Our server seemed like he didn't quite care, once we mentioned we were in a hurry he stopped making eye contact. We also did not get any bread before our meal. Not that I could eat it anyway, but my husband was missing it. Especially when everyone around us had some. Also, our check didn't come in a booklet.

Three times.   Consistency in service here gets a C- but the food is always satisfactory.  I dislike change so I order the same things over and over again but I'm not upset.  Each dish comes out better than the last time I ordered it.

She took about 10 min to even come give us some water, we ordered, food came about 30 min later and my rice was not cooked at all and the chicken was pink.

We were a party of 5 hanging out outside, with my rambunctious and tired one year old, when the buzzer went off indicating our table was ready. We went in and was told to stand at the hostess table as we would be seated shortly. It was super cramped at the hostess table but we were expecting to be seated shortly so it wasn't a big deal. Unfortunately, that was not remotely the case! We waited another 20minutes while other parties (same size as ours, some larger, some smaller) were all seated. It was so incredibly uncomfortable. We kept getting bumped into by both staff and patrons. We asked multiple times when we would be seated and we kept receiving the same answer ""soon"". Mind you, we had already waited 45minutes for our buzzer to go off. Needless to say I was not very happy with any of the hosts or the managers who were foreseeing this fiasco with us and with the giant crowd growing inside at the host stand. However, the best part about our visit was our waitress. She was absolutely fantastic, I wish I knew her name so I could give her credit. She did an amazing job regardless of how busy she was.

38,Jason Y.,"Syracuse, UT",205,20,131.0,2.0,2016-12-19,"Great food, great service from the wait staff - Manager was passive aggressive. My wife and I stopped by the Cheesecake Factory on 16DEC2016 at about 2pm for lunch at the City Creek Mall in SLC, Utah. She had the chicken and couscous and i had the Kobe burger (which was outstanding). Our server was knowledgeable and promptly answered our questions about the dishes we placed under consideration before we ordered, and when we did order - they were out in a very reasonable amount of time. I never had to ask for a drink refill: Be proactive on this servers, and you will be well compensated for your efforts. During our meal, the manager came out to our table  and asked me if my 360 camera (that was mounted in a tripod and sitting on the table so I wouldn't kick or sit in it) was recording video. I told her it wasn't and she said that she didn't care...but corporate would. I found this odd that Cheesecake Factory corporate doesn't allow recording video inside the restaurant. One would think that recording memories and events would be encouraged. I assured her that I was not recording video and showed her that the camera was off by turning it on, showing her the blue LED's and then turning it back off. I told her that I could place the camera on the floor under the table or on the chair next to me if it was a concern. She said it wasn't her...it was 'corporate' that had the problem, and left. After this interruption by the manager, we went back to conversation and enjoying our meal.  A few minutes later, 2 of the waitstaff started taping pieces of paper on the glass separator (level with the camera sensor and lens) apparently to attempt to 'block the recording' that the manager had insisted I was doing. My wife got pissed off and grabbed the camera and shoved it under the table. The wait staff (a very nice young woman and young man) said they were tasked by the manager to, 'block the recording of how we cook our food'. That is paraphrasing, but she seemed embarrassed that she was tasked to carry out this objective.  To be honest - I was embarrassed for her. When I asked her (the wait staff) why the manager didn't object that the camera was on the table after I asked her if she would feel more comfortable if I placed the camera under the table, she said, ""Oh my God, the manager said you were trying to video record how we prepare our dishes, I'm so sorry!"" I had the Kobe Burger. It isn't rocket science how to cook a hamburger. You cook it, flip it, cook it then eat it. I'm not sure why Kobe burger flipping is a secret at Cheesecake Factory...but it was a pretty damn good hamburger. While we won't be coming back to Cheesecake Factory...it isn't because the food is bad, or the wait staff is incompetent.  It is because Cheesecake Factory 'corporate' hired a passive aggressive 'manager' that believes people are trying to record how the food is made, and is not genuine when interacting with customers. **UPDATED Monday Dec 19 (a few days after my last visit to Cheese Cake Factory)** I added +1 because as you can see below, CCF responded to my review. It is my opinion that CS on social media is an important part of the Customer Experience. This shows me that CCF's digital strategy team is willing to pick up the ball after it was dropped by the City Creek restaurant manager. I replicated my initial review on G+ (where they indicate they had responded) but I haven't read it yet.  Validation begets validation. +1 to CCF digital strategy for acknowledging and addressing my concern in a timely manner.

57,Ty B.,"North Salt Lake, UT",0,10,3.0,1.0,2017-01-20,"We have gone to this Cheesecake several times and not had too many issues. We like the food and the Cheesecake is an obvious. We haven't ever had amazing service though and tonight was the straw that broke the camels back. We were waiting in line to sit in the self seating bar area behind 2 other couples. One of them got a table after about ten minutes. The couple in front of us continued waiting for a while. Then we noticed 2 girls that had walked in front of us all and looked like they were going to sit in the bar area so the gentleman in front of us let them know that there was a line for the tables and they told him that the restaurant had told them there is no line and that it was first come first serve. I then stepped in and explained that yes it is first come first serve but we were all there before they were. They said they weren't looking for a fight and it was ok. When a table came open the couple in front of us beat the girls too it. So the girls sat at a table where two people had not even stood to leave yet. I asked the girls to allow my wife and I (who were holding a baby this whole time) to have the table because as we discussed earlier we had been waiting for a good half hour longer than the girls had. They refused to move and told me to talk to the restaurant if I wanted anything to be done. So I talked to a server who basically said tough shit to me and I asked for the manager. Manager came out and said although he agreed it wasn't right that the girls did that there was no way for him to ask them to wait and that the ""corporate"" policy was whoever sat in the table first got it. I asked if he really wanted people acting like animals to get tables and he said no but there is nothing he can do about it. Preceded to tell me how I was in the wrong and when my wife realized they were about to kick us out for ""making a scene"" we ended up just leaving. The management could have done a much better job and should have some sort of ""line"" for the area they are going to let patrons self govern. I never thought they needed that before because I didn't realize people would be so indecent but manager acted like it was normal and happened all the time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-salt-lake-city-2?start=80,2.6,2.84,2.84,2.6920000000000006,2.744

Yesterday I went with my brother and aunt. The service was quick, considering a Tuesday night at 6. It was awesome we were seated quickly and our waiter was so amazing. I can never complain about the service.  Now for food, I have to first mention... I LOVE THE BREAD here ! Like ugh, yesterday it came out so fresh and warm. I always want to eat like 5 loafs but the portions here at the Cheesecake Factory are huge so if I ever ate that much bread, I can forget about the entree lol. Now onto the real stuff.  My brother got the lemon chicken I believe. The portions came out nice with potatoes and a side of veggies. His chicken looked great. He told me that it's a great burst of flavor in every bite. So if you're a chicken lover. This would be a good choice, as long as you like lemon too.  My aunt got the pasta carbonara, but with shrimp instead of chicken. She really enjoyed it. Finished the whole thing faster than me and my brother eating. She said it was flavorful and the amount of food was more than enough.  If you love pasta, this is a good one to try.  I got the skinnylicious enchilada. Which I've had before, and I love. It's low in calories but tastes just as great. The side salad it comes with is just wonderful. I absolutely love the cheese and the amount of chicken they place in each one. I think it's a good healthy dinner if you're not looking for a basic salad. It's a must try.  We didn't try cheesecake but I'll have to next time cause it looks so great! I'll be back again !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-salt-lake-city-2,2.76,2.82,2.82,3.156,2.796
33,Jennifer J.,"Draper, UT",145,122,263.0,5.0,2017-03-20,"Sometimes getting a table at The Cheesecake Factory in a timely manner can feel as impossible as getting an audience with royalty. I didn't have high hopes that on the first night of FanX we'd be able to get a table in less than three hours, but they shocked me when they told us the wait would only be thirty minutes. I was even more pleasantly surprised when thirty minutes only ended up being about fifteen. I'm sure because of the event there was a lot of traffic throughout this establishment this evening, but have to compliment the entire staff for remaining professional and high on positive energy. Nothing but good vibes here this night, considering how many oddly dressed people (my party included!) might have passed through. As far as food goes, I've mentioned it for another location. I feel like there is something for everyone here; the menu is huge and can accommodate all tastes and even appetite sizes. And if you're looking for something to help you keep your waistline trim, they've got that, too.  My friend and I split a pasta dish that she selected; it sounded just okay, but was ridiculously tasty. The wine was really evident in the sauce, and the pasta was cooked to perfection. The chicken was moist, too, and didn't taste veiny. Our server, Andrew, was extremely professional and rolled with the punches, even when presented with a very odd request. My friend JJ and I don't get to see each other all that often, and we both have seriously quirky personalities. We decided we wanted to recreate the scene from ""Lady and the Tramp"" after we were joking about our shared pasta dish and if we only had a meatball and one strand of spaghetti. Andrew graciously accommodated our request, bringing out one meatball and one strand of spaghetti so we could act the scene for a few laughs with our friends. I loved that he said in his ten years of being in the service industry that this was the first time he'd ever had anyone do this particular iconic movie scene. This is the type of service industry professional I've always attempted to be, and this is the type of server that I love having when I go up.

6,Bryn M.,"Midvale, UT",8,72,14.0,2.0,2017-04-10,"I used to be a fan of this restaurant, especially for a chain. My last few experiences here have been disappointing enough to want to write this review. We went around 8:30 on a Friday night with a larger group (5 adults and 5 kids, two of whom are smaller). We were told the wait would be 45 minutes, which makes sense on a Friday night. We told the hostess we had a party of 10 and needed that to include two high chairs. They gave us our number and we waited....and waited.....and waited. Finally after an hour an a half we asked the hostess how much longer it would be. She told us we were getting close and that a certain party had to leave before we could be seated. All this would have been fine if the service and food had been decent. When we were taken to our seat we were short both chairs and high chairs. The person seating us said our booking had been listed for 8 people. We told him we couldn't all sit and he shrugged and walked away. We had to flag someone else down who told us we couldn't scoot the open table next to us over because they were about to use it. They wanted all 10 of us to sit around two four tops scooted together. We finally were able to get someone to allow us to move the additional table and then they had to go pull two high chairs out of a storage closet to get our kids seated. The waiter then brought us water and we ordered drinks. He shorted us a water for one of the kids so I asked him for an additional water and we ordered drinks besides that. We had enough time during the seating wait to know exactly what we wanted to order, but it was almost another 25 minutes before he brought out the drinks and bread and at that point he still forgot the water for the kid he missed in the first place. I asked him for it again and we were able to order our food. We were on two checks and just on our check we ordered well over 100 dollars worth of food (more like $150). Of that only one of the dishes was even half decent, which was the Buffalitos. We ordered factory nachos and they took so long to come out that the entire plate was soggy and cold. We also ordered Chicken Bellagio and one whole breast was nothing but fat and gristle. There was also some weird colored fat on the prosciutto, which is usually quite good. The worst of the meals was the Factory Burrito. It was old and dry and tasted like it had been made and then sat for hours under a heat lamp. The food took so long to come out that this could have been sitting for a long time. The others who were with us also ordered Apple Juices for their kids which came out after two reminders and once we had ordered dessert. The cheesecake itself we took to go because it was so late. The 30th anniversary was half frozen and put into the wrong container so that it was completely squished. Overall what should have been a fun night out that we saved to splurge on was stressful and disappointing. I actually contacted the restaurant directly about these issues before posting my review on yelp. I wanted to give them a chance to respond directly, but this was the second time in a row we've had a poor experience and I haven't heard a word back despite reaching out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-salt-lake-city-2?start=40,3.0,2.92,2.92,2.6640000000000006,2.9520000000000004

In fact we planned on going to another restaurant but the power was out in their area so we decided on the Cheesecake Factory. *Service was great, 5/5 We arrived a little after 8pm and despite seeing several large groups waiting in the lobby they were able to seat the two of us in just a couple of minutes. Our waiter was there when we needed and allowed us space to talk and eat. *Atmosphere was good, 4/5 Our placement wasn't the greatest but I can't complain. It would've been nice to have a little more room between our table and the other patrons. The dim lighting was on the dark side, but I can see that they were setting it up to be more of an intimate dining experience. *Food, 1/5 The free bread before the meal was better than the chicken carbonara. Before I ordered I asked our waiter to weigh in on a couple of dishes I was deciding between, they recommend the chicken carbonara. The presentation was bad. Before I even tried it I could tell it must've been sitting in the window for 20min. It's possible this was ordered by someone else and sent back. The dish lacked flavor, was stale and old, lukewarm at best, and extremely oily. Even if the food had come straight from the kitchen it wouldn't have made up for the lack of taste. Nothing about the food was fresh, from the pasta to the peas. *Wrap-Up I've been several times before, generally with a big group. Usually I'm excited to go back and try something else, but this time I left thinking it was my last. It was bad enough that after getting home I hunted for food from the fridge and cupboards.

When I check in 10 minutes prior to my reservation, often I still have to wait 20-30 minutes from that check in point.

70,Bobby S.,"Salt Lake City, UT",63,39,5.0,2.0,2017-08-08,"My family and I checked in to Cheesecake Factory at about 6:25pm. We were there to celebrate family members who were going away for 1.5-2 years, doing service work. The representative told us it would take an hour to get a table (on a Tuesday night), and it was fine. Our ringer notified us at about 7:45pm that our table was ready.  We initially asked for a table for 15, but ended up asking for 18. When we got to our table, it was pretty tight, so my brother cleaned a table and a few chairs and added it to ours (so we could fit). We ended up with 20 people. After this happened, one of the waiters came up to our table and told us that we weren't supposed to do that. Then, he told us how wrong we were to do that. He, then, went to tell a manager named Josh who came out and yelled at us in front of everyone. So embarrassing! He yelled, ""You guys said 18 and now there's 20! What you're doing is making another family wait longer! You're also taking a table away that should've been cleaned up for someone else!"" EVERYONE who was in the restaurant just stared at us. He was so unprofessional at handling a situation under pressure, and both of these guys (Josh and the male waiter with glasses) treated us like we had stolen money out of their cash boxes!  I sat there feeling uneasy about the situation, and I went to find the General Manager (Mike). As one of the managers at the restaurant, Josh should've felt good that we were bringing in business! We were buying dinner and desserts for over 20 people so we were paying for the service charge as well. Since I don't believe in paying people (or a business) to treat me like crap, yell at me, and embarrass me in front of other paying customers for a SERVICE (and the GM wasn't there), I went looking for another manager. I found Cindy and she was amazing! She told us we were ok to sit there. In fact, she cleaned up another table and moved things around so my entire family could all fit. Our waiter (Ethan) was truly kind and easy going. He was aware of the situation and did his best to make it better! He delivered the best possible service that a waiter could offer. If it wasn't for Ethan or Cindy, the night would've been HORRIBLE! Between the horrible interaction we've had with Josh and an unknown waiter, and the wonderful help and true customer service from Cindy and Ethan we're giving this restaurant 2-stars. UPDATE (2 weeks later 8/25) I contacted their GM (the next day) to inform him about Josh's actions, and he apologized and said he'd send a letter to me as a ""formal apology."" Well,  2 weeks later and still no word. Their customer service isn't about the customer. It's about their bottom line! Don't spend your hard earned money here.

When she came back to the table she dropped off their check and went to another table in her section checked on them and walked back out of site. Finally she returned to the section checked on one other table and then decided to make formal contact with me asking for my drink selection.

Here it goes: If you want to go to The Factory, and don't want the lines you'll often find, come for Sunday Brunch. We arrived today around 10:30 a.m., were greeted by a near-empty parking lot and a zero minute wait. That's right, all the yummy CF offerings, none of the crowds or noise.   To me, The Cheesecake Factory is the only national chain that is a Jack of All Trades, Master of ... All Trades.  They make great Saturday and Sunday Brunch-specific meals. I love the Green Chilaquiles with carnitas, slow-cooked pork (you can also choose chicken), roasted Poblanos, cilantro, tomatillo chile sauce, sour cream, cheese, onions, and corn tortillas. Their Monte Cristo is amazing .. the Monte Cristo is my favorite sandwich and only a few places in town make it right. The Factory's is my favorite. And the Fried Chicken and Waffles Benedict ... a Factory original mashup of poached and Hollandaise-covered poached eggs with deep-fried chicken strops on top of a Belgian Waffle. And their maple-butter syrup ... man, I could drink this glorious stuff.   On our most recent brunch, we cheated a bit and ate off of their lunch menu. We started with the Egg Roll Sampler: Crispy Cuban (AMAZING, my favorite!), Firecracker Salmon, Tex-Mex, and Avocado. They make epically good egg rolls.   For the main course, I got the Crispy Pineapple Chicken and Shrimp. It's a little sweet, a little savory, and a lot of yummy. My wife got the Chicken Parmesan ""Pizza Style"": Breaded chicken covered with marinara and cheese; it has a big serving of angel-hair pasta with creamy Alfredo sauce.  Both are awesome, but my wife's Parm has the advantage of being real filling ... the lucky girl gets another meal out of it.   Oh, yeah, they make cheesecake! Faves are a matter of personal taste, but I've never had one that is meh or bad. I love them all, but the ones that have a special place in my heart are Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple, Reece's Peanut Butter Chocolate, Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake, Tiramisu, and Peppermint Bark.

The Cheesecake, I mean come on, it's the Cheesecake Factory and I will give it to them, still to this day the Dulce De Leche, Snickers, Oreo, essentially all their creations are delicious. And that's about it. Come on guys, I've seen some college publications shorter than the menu at CF. I somehow always manage to spend 30 minutes reading the biggest menu on the planet. Why? Why the need for so many options? Think of it this way. You're trying to impress a date. Would you wear a dashing tuxedo? or would you wear a tuxedo, a suit, your funeral suit, your wedding suit, your prom suit ALL at once. Why? What are you trying to hide? It's simple, their absolutely mediocre less than impressive food. It's really not that good. Just a lot of it on a plate in a dimly lit restaurant so you can't really see how bad it is.  However, what were we expecting? It's a chain, their focus is essentially the same as McDonald's, VOLUME. Their intent isn't making the best mac and cheese burger, or pineapple chicken and rice, or chicken curry, or the best spaghetti there is. They stuff you with volume and trick you into thinking it's the best thing you've ever had. Don't be fooled. Skip the tom foolery and go straight to dessert. No pretense, you can't hide a bad cheesecake (or maybe you can).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-salt-lake-city-2,3.36,2.92,2.92,,3.096
65,Anthony B.,"Provo, UT",22,1,,2.0,2017-12-10,"First if all the cheesecakes are great, hence the name of the restaurant. I waited 2 hours to be seated which is reasonable because it was super busy. Once seated, I ordered a filet mignon. Keep in mind this particular filet is the most tender and most expensive as well. Our waiter was great, especially for the restaurant being so busy,  Basically the only reason I don't give this place one star. After waiting another 40 minutes just to get my food, my filet arrived. First of all, it was super burnt, cut in half, and not even juicy or tender at all!!! 30 dollars for what literally looked like a meteor that hit my plate.  Not even exaggerating.  First sign that the chef sucked was the filet being cut in half. Second sign was the fact that it was already easy to cook since it was cut in half but even then, chef manages to burn the filet still!  One half of the  filet was literally charcoal black. Even a piece I kept staring at because it was just so black and hard that even a starving child in Africa wouldn't even eat it, not even look at it! The other half of the filet was barely even edible but still dry and had a taste that was 1 dollar worth. Not to be mean but I would bet all my money on McDonald's, because hell I'm sure they can make a better filet and price it at 1 dollar. So not worth a 30 dollar price tag. I should have been refunded for this pathetic plate",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-salt-lake-city-2?start=20,3.32,2.9,2.9,,3.068

25,Sandra S.,"Sandy, UT",99,47,7.0,2.0,2017-12-26,"Pretty disappointed in today's visit. Me and my boyfriend came here as a late birthday dinner. I ordered the chicken Madeira and the other dish ordered was the pasta with shrimp and sausage. The chicken Madeira, when I first tasted it, the temperature of the food felt like it was sitting out for 10 minutes or so. It was not even warm, and my chicken barely had the wine sauce. With the pasta, it was was undercooked and it came out with chicken instead of the shrimp so we had it sent back. I'm sure they took someone else ordered cause they said they made him a ""new"" plate but it wasn't even five minutes. I also felt bad because a couple next to us were here first before us and we got our food before then.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-salt-lake-city-2,3.08,2.89,2.89,,2.966

21,Christine S.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,5,7.0,1.0,2018-01-07,"This is by far the worst Cheesecake Factory experience I have ever had. I have gone to several CFs in other states, but this one gave the well known popular restaurant a bad name.  I had a fairly large party and we were celebrating my brother in laws graduation. We understood reservations were not taken at a certain time and by the time we got there it was 8 pm. There was a high volume of guest and parties already waiting to be seated so our wait time was 3 hours. We decided to wait. After about an hour and a half we came back a checked with the host on the wait time and she stated it went down 30-20 mins instead. We were so relieved considering many of us were already so hungry.  Across the waiting area there is a dining room. As we waited the remaining time there was a large table that had not been cleaned for at least 30 mins. Once they cleaned it they sat the other large party ahead of us. Half our group are from Vegas and we were surprised how long they waited to clean the table considering that large party probably waited longer than us. At the CF in Vegas they would clean the tables right away. CF staff are quite known to be diligent.   Before we were seated my sister asked the host if our party was gonna be able to sit together or visible to each other and she said yes. Once we were seated we were taken to 3 booths. Two were right next to each other and the other table was four tables away from ours. You can imagine our confusion. I can understand if the booths were right next to each other but to have a third of our party sat on the other side of the section did not make any sense at all. My sister asked the host if there was any way for all of us to sit together and the host said, "" I don't know right now this is the best option "" and then walked away to attend to other guest. My sister asked another question and the other host kept saying, "" I don't know, I don't know..."" The responses were not helping at all.  We sat down and ordered our drinks. My sister who was very uphad to go up to the podium to speak to the host again about the table arrangements. Eventually the table that was very far from the others was moved to a much closer table. This also meant the servers had to switch. There were great confusion with the seating and our server already seemed flustered and irritable. My sister asked for a plate from the server and he yelled at her and asked if she needed anything else. They took one of the dishes from one of the guest in our party (who did not move at all) to a different table. This person had to watch us eat and when his food came we were already done. We tried to make the most of the dinner.  Although the dinner was not what we had hoped would be I appreciate the staff for trying.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-salt-lake-city-2,3.04,2.9,2.9,,2.9560000000000004
