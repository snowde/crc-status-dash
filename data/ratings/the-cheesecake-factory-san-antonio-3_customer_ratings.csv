48,Amy S.,"San Antonio, TX",73,34,81.0,3.0,2012-01-05,"Open since 5 December 2011, the Cheesecake Factory is a chain restaurant known for their gargantuan portion sizes. The NW side of San Antonio is teeming with chain restaurants and the Shops at La Cantera is no stranger to embracing them. It's unfortunate San Antonio chefs and chef owned restaurants are lacking on this side of town.   Nonetheless, our party of four was seated promptly and courteously.  Our server was friendly and attentive.  I personally ordered a child's portion meal which was more than enough of portion to satisfy me. The husband and guests were pleased with their menu selections. Always a good place to eat to take home leftovers for your next meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio-3?start=160,3.1800000000000006,3.1800000000000006,3.1800000000000006,3.1800000000000006,3.1800000000000006

We spent a decent amount, had alcohol, appetizers, food, and dessert but you would think we were scum. The waitress would not make eye contact so that we could order a second round of drinks, we had to get the manager to give us a wine menu and to order our 2nd round. The waitress would move as fast as she could to avoid eye contact. When I paid I was going to ask for a box for the cake and she dropped it and ran as fast as she could. Having to call the manager over twice, I would have thought he would have corrected this or offered something like a coffee or some sort of token, but no.

I asked to speak to the manager, his response was even more disappointing, he stated he just had the same conversation with another table....  He didn't offer to take anything off our bill or a complementary dessert for next visit.  He only offered worthless excuses.   We spent a lot of money on a disappointing dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio-3?start=180,3.24,3.24,3.24,3.24,3.2400000000000007

73,Jason R.,"Cedar Park, TX",45,14,1.0,5.0,2012-09-28,"This is definitely one of my favorite places at La Cantera! First you have cheesecake.  Keep in mind this is not MY reason for coming but everyone that I've come here with (ranging from my wife to cousins to groups of friends) are always satisfied with their nightly choice of cheesecake. Secondly, the serving sizes.  I've you're concerned with not g etting what you pay for just dispatch that from your mind immediately.  Their lunch portions are good enough for dinner portions and for the most part, their dinner portions are enough for 2 meals (I'm lookin' at you meatloaf.) Third, SIT OUTSIDE.  Actually only do so if it's a good day outside.  If not, feel free to sit inside it's equally as good, however this is one of the only places where the patio is decently covered and not excessibely loud or distracting (or HOT). Lastly the staff is on their game.  I've never had a bad thing to say about anyone that I've come in contact there. I even once left my 'doggy bag' at my table and walked away.  They bussed the table and I came back and it was :cringe: gone.  I was able to speak to the manager about how excited I was to eat my leftovers the next day and lo' and behold he gave me a 25 dollar gift card to come back at our leisure and enjoy their services all over again.  That's about as good in customer service as it gets. I can't say anything in comparison to the North Star Mall location as I've never been there but definitely give this one a try if you are in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio-3?start=140,3.604,3.604,3.604,3.604,3.6040000000000005

53,Don R.,"Boerne, TX",0,3,,1.0,2014-01-12,"Nothing worse than being disappointed by a old friend. We visited the Cheesecake Factory in the La Cantera Mall for a late lunch. We were made to wait a short time although the restaurant was but half full. After another wait at iur table, our server Beth greeted us with the usual request for drinks. We had sufficient time to read the menu fore and aft, so we were ready to order drinks and meal. Beth took the order with my wife ordering a chicken marsella, I believe and my order of their most costly item a Ribeye with French fries and a dinner salad in addition.  I instructed our server to substitute Caesar dressing for their standard vinegarette. Beth brought our ice teas and I asked for a tea spoon to add equal to my tea.  After about 20 minutes, I stopped Beth as she passed us for the 4th time and asked her for my tea spoon. She said, ""They haven't brought me one from the back yet!"" I told her that twenty minutes was unreasonable to wait, whereas she brought my wife and I fresh napkins with silver as she mumbled that she had to do it this way!!!???. Then she delivered a half hour late the bread and butter that us customarily provided at the drink service. We waited for my salad for another 20 minutes as Beth finaaly had the facilitators deliver our meals NOT as ordered but without french fries and a substitute salad with vinegarette and Caesar dressing on the side. I told the facilitator to take the salad back where she decided to tell me that I had ordered it thst way. My wife's meal appeared to be as ordered, I got a plate with a 1/4"" ribeye, over cooked and a butter knife to cut it. This $27 steak I didn't expect to be of Barn Door quality but I did expect it to be better than a Dennys $12.95 steak. As i truly struggled to cut this piece taken from between the horns, the manager came to rescue our experience. We sat and listened to him bad mouth Beth's mistakes, I began to feel sorry for her having to work for this guy of little managerial experience. Aster another 20 minutes my steak and my wife's chicken were both swimming in a coagulated slime of excess fat. The manager returned with the steak knife and began again his excuses where at I asked him, "" just let us finish and thank you."" Now make believe you a manager of a nation chain who business model strives for consistency in food and service nationwide.  You have 2 early retirees very displeased; what would you do? Well this is what they did... Beth shows up with a dessert menu and asks, ""Will you be ordering cheesecake? She know the answer as she flopped the bill on the table turned on her heals and went where she disappears to. I opened the portfolio and what do you think I saw? Now you're the manger, what would you do to 2 regular customers who are exactly the demographic any restaurant is looking for. Well, your wrong, they charged me for everything including what I didn't get!!! I gave her my credit card and much later as usual, she brought me my receipt and very cheerfully said the manager took off the French fries you didn't get!

Every Sunday, The Cheesecake factory serve brunch. I have been a few times to the North Star location (nothing to yelp about.). So I decided to try the La Cantera location.  My mouth watered as I read Belgian Waffle with Peanut Butter Cream, Fresh Banana, Bacon and Maple-Butter Syrup. They usually sprinkle the bacon on top, but I made a request to have it on the side. Service was relatively fast. Once I was serviced I eyeballed my plate and wanted to take a photo before eating, but I could not help myself. I devour those waffles as a fugitive that was on the run and this was my first meal out of the joint in 40 years (Jail House Rock, get it? Ok I am corny.). I had made Elvis style pancakes before even try to recreate the famous sandwich nothing comes close to how good this plate was (was meaning two minutes after me eating it like a ""Hound Dog""). The Peanut Butter cream was nice and creamy even melted when the hot pecan tasting syrup touch it. The Bananas was, in fact, fresh with no brown only brown was the Maple-Butter Syrup.

Soup, salad, sandwich that could easily feed two and not to mention the bread which is to die for! Finally, the reason people go to the Cheesecake Factory: cheesecake. The newest flavor, lemon meringue, was beyond delicious as was the classic chocolate mousse.

When the host tried to seat us, in a very narrow area that would create issues for servers to walk by, I had to ask to be moved to another table that had ample space for a stroller. Normally I wouldn't have brought the stroller to the table but our toddler was sleeping after fighting naps all day, so we were;t gonna mess up a good thing.  Our server was very nice and attentive to all our needs so I would give 4 stars to her. However, don't order chicken piccata from this place. The chicken was cooked wrong, it was terrible. Then the sauce was almost like a soup with green stuff floating all over and scarce capers. I love capers and thats a huge reason why I order this plate, but I guess the price of capers these days is up there with gold. I gave one of the three pieces of chicken to my husband who likes to vacuum up my extras like an anteater but even he didn't like it. In all, I think I ate one piece and had a few bites of the pasta.  My husband ordered the Ballagio chicken I believe, its lightly fried and crispy, very thin, topped with arugula and prosciutto. As I looked at his plate in envy, he devoured it and claimed it was glorious.  Our son had bow tie pasta with meat sauce, it looked good but they were holding back on the sauce, so he didn't finish it.

Our original nameless server got our drink order while her hands were full of dirty dishes from the table next to us, we ordered the stuffed mushrooms for the appetizer(which was brought out by another nameless server), which were okay in flavor, although as our table was set with no knives, we had to ask a passing server for some. Our nameless server took our food order, then told us the evening shift was starting and we would be getting Jessica as our new server. Our food was brought out by surprise! Another nameless server. Presumably Jessica checked on us about 1/4 of the way into our meal asking if it was okay. Since I'm a server and was trying to have a nice day I didn't complain, however my salad tasted like wilted dirty lettuce and the grilled onions on the burger tasted like dirty fryer, we should have.

143,Mister D.,"San Antonio, TX",51,479,137.0,4.0,2015-04-14,"Environment: B (+0.5) We met here for a business meeting/luncheon. It was a nice day so we decided to sit outside on the patio and the seating was excellent (little padded benches that were really comfortable). The only reason there was a -0.5 was because the hosts/hostesses sat a large family with a dozen kids next to us. When a customer tells you they are there on business, be mindful of who/where you're seating people around them (and for reference they have a massive patio so this is not a completely unreasonable request). The end result was while we were trying to talk, we had random kids running around with balloons chasing each other and screaming.  Food Quality:  A (+1) Everything looked and tasted great. I had the fish tacos at the recommendation of the server and they came out great. I usually hate black beans and rice, but both were surprisingly good. Selection: A (+1) The menus are actually books with pages after pages of food items. I'm not sure how often food items get updated here, but I imagine they have seasonal items.  Don't let the books fool you though - there are ads throughout the menu books, so while they are long, this makes them seem much more extensive than they really are.  Service: A (+1) Our Server was Julian and he did an excellent job. He had just the right amount of attentiveness to where he wasn't nagging but he wasn't neglectful either. Drinks stayed filled and he made excellent recommendations for us all and we were thoroughly impressed with his service and knowledge of the menu.  Value: A (+1) For the food quality and level of service, I felt as if the cost that I paid for my meal was more than justified. It's also important to consider the location - being inside the mall around other premium restaurants (like Perry's Steakhouse and Yard House), Cheesecake Factory is actually competitive on pricing, all things considered.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio-3?start=100,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.7359999999999998,3.2000000000000006

First, I wonder if I happened to be assigned the same waitress as  another reviewer (David R.).   Although we were not treated nearly as bad as David seems to have been, our waitress seemed disengaged and ho-hum about her job.  She made us feel like she really didn't want to be serving us and she didn't have a welcoming demeanor about her.  My wife's choice words were, ""stuck up"".    The next negative point is one that really got to me from the get-go.   As I was reviewing the menu I happened to look down at the fork that was sitting in front of me -- it had an old lettuce leaf plastered to it, yummy :).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio-3?start=100,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.44,3.0000000000000004

Every location I go to; doesn't matter if it's in STL where I currently live or in NJ/NY when visiting family.  The food is always good.  Now let me tell you about this visit. Honestly this was the worst service I have ever had. We paid our bill and went across the street.  We were on vacation. Talking about moving out there within the next year. We were at 6flags earlier that day then stopped by to do some shopping. (He had showers at the hotel so we're in cute dinner clothes. We didn't come straight from 6flags) anyways.  Most reviews were negative towards the host. However all 4 of them were welcoming and friendly. One day us at a little two top. We waited almost 10 minutes before a server came and we both asked for water for now. We both had a headache. Probably from being in the sun all day.  I wanted a cocktail but she had someone else drop off the water. Okay no big deal. So we came by for our order and we still weren't felling that well. So I told her we realized we aren't THAT hungry we are just going to do some apps. We ordered 2 and I asked to keep the 1 menu.  (We were going to order more but never got the chance). I guess since we said we weren't that hungry, that meant we weren't worth her time. I'm in the industry. TRUST ME I would have been worth her time. (Her name was Melody, Mellie, or Melanie) we had to ask a busser who barely spoke English for more water. She walked by and dropped off our check. Clearly she didn't want us to order more.  We ended up doing next store to get cocktails and food and dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio-3?start=120,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.3440000000000003,3.0000000000000004

Their happy hour has a nice selection of food for $5.50. We ordered the warm crab and artichoke dip (AMAZING) and the happy hour burger. On previous occasions I've tried the avocado egg rolls (super good!), the sweet corn tamale cakes (very flavorful but they fall apart easily) and the spinach dip (just okay). On this visit we also tried the Greek salad for $6.75 (it was pretty disappointing - very bitter arugula and too much dressing), next time we'll just get the regular salad.

Pasta and salmon is pretty good and the price is just right.  This story was from June of 2015, and i never ever went back. Unfortunately, the useless and empty headed hostesses can really make your life so much more complicated. I had a hostess give us a 30 min wait time and when finally got called, she sat me and my 3 friends, only for us to order drinks and her come back and tell us she accidentally gave us someone else's table and she gave our table to someone else, so we had to wait another 25 min or go sit outside (when one of our guests wasn't able to sit outside for health reasons).  So we sat outside and sure enough our waitress was the worst server i have ever encountered. She brought things out late, cold, gave us attitude and never gave us refills, not to mention we rarely saw her. It wasn't even busy and we realized people who were seated way after us had gotten their food already.  When we were wanting to order dessert she had rolled her eyes because she had our ticket ready, so we told her to forget it and I gave her my card. Later she came back and put the bill on the table only for her to pick it up again and circle something very harsh and vigorously at the bottom of the ticket. When she places it in front of me, i look at it and noticed she circled the gratuity percentages. Um? i can read. The ticket was torn due to how harsh she circled, and that did it for me.  I am known to leaving nothing less than 20% tip when i go out. I love tipping because i love making others feel like they did good work. But this girl? Hell no.

He refilled as soon as my glasses were empty which I couldn't stop appreciating and being hungry I underestimated the quantity. Oh my god it was a lot of food!

I take mine black no milk and no sugar but their blend was actually pretty classy. It wasn't bitter at all like a good black coffee. I can't stand the coffee at ihop so I was a little nervous ordering coffee here.  I would come here again but maybe mainly for desserts since the ambiance service and the sweet stuff were my favorite bits. I might try to explore the menu more but I think it's best to stick with the cheesecake and coffee because I like to play it safe. Keep up the good work!

I took a big bite of one of the meatballs and it was raw....when we told the waitress, she questioned me...she said verbatim ""which meatball was it?"" and followed to question my statement. As I pointed to which meatball it was, she said if I wanted to get a fresh plate of just meatballs by itself, and I agreed thinking I was going to get a fresh plate, but moments later the manager Kim came up and said that if I wanted she could just take the old meatballs and ""warm them up"" not even offering my new meatballs, let alone a fresh plate of pasta. At this point I was starving so I agreed to the suggestion of warming up my meatballs. So on a dirty bread plate that was on our table, I continued to place the meatballs on the plate. Kim grabbed the dirty plate with my undercooked meatballs to the back. I waited for 15 min and still no meatballs...so I proceed to eat what was left of my cold spaghetti....meatball-less....finally the waitress came back and was like ""oh you still haven't gotten your meatballs?"" And I said ""NO"". Because I had already ate all my pasta I didn't see a point in still waiting for the re-heated meatballs. So I cancelled my order...she left for a few minutes and came back with the manager Kim and said they were only going to charge me for a spaghetti and marinara sauce for the inconvenience....My friend Jackie complained to Kim again because she felt it was ill from their part to still charge me for a plate that I didn't even get to enjoy because of the undercooked meat.

PRO:  Seated as soon as we arrived in a clean booth with clean utensils this time. Waitress came promptly to get our drinks and food orders. Food came fast. CON: We had a waitress come to take our drink order, then a waiter showed up a minute after to take our drinks and when we told him someone else had already taken it, he walked away saying ""Wow, that's great..."" sarcastically. Husbands pork chop was dry and mashed potatoes were bland. Ordered the Thai Lettuce Wraps since there was no chicken parmesan, would be nice to put in the menu that there is cilantro (I can't eat this stuff) This is what the menu says ""Create Your Own Thai Lettuce Rolls! Satay Chicken Strips, Carrots, Bean Sprouts, Coconut Curry Noodles and Lettuce Leaves with three delicious Spicy Thai Sauces - Peanut, Sweet Red Chili and Tamarind-Cashew."" Had to carefully make sure I picked out each piece big and small. MORE OF THE OK SIDE: I was really excited for the chicken parmesan pizza style, only to find out they were all out, I understood since they said this was a ""good dish"". Ordered a Tiramisu cake, it was good, but for $9?  Overall, not what I expected from ""The Cheesecake Factory"" that everyone talks about.

Not sure that's the excuse for the excessively long, small printed menu, yet the options can be overwhelming. On the other hand, they have a variety of cheesecakes. The garlic, cheesy bread was great, yet the two dips that came with it lacked any real favor. The avocado egg rolls were good, yet not great. The dipping sauce was on point, yet the actual ""avocado"" portion was gross processed gauc wrapped in a delicious, crispy wonton shell. Thank God for dipping sauce. Soon the meals came out, yet not before two very poor renditions of ""Happy Birthday"" or whatever celebration song the staff sang. A New Orleans Jazz Funeral would have had more pep than the flat, uninspired vocals that announced that a birthday boy or girl was among us. Just before the meal, we all agreed that if they attempted to sing this cringeworthy song for my sister whose birthday we were celebrating, we would politely decline (and we never faced the awkward decision). The meals came out fairly quickly. I ordered the Chicken Bellagio, my sister - the Crusted Chicken Romano, and my hubby - the New York Strip. His plate was stripped like a sad casino showgirl - so much lost potential. On the other hand, he said the steak was perfectly cooked. My sister loved her Chicken Romano, yet took half of it home since the lunch portion was huge! I did the same with my Chicken Bellagio (which I just finished eating 6-7 hours later, without heating, and it still tasted fabulous!) Let's get to the part where this place really shines - cheesecakes! My sis opted for Red Velvet (her personal fav). My hubby went healthy with the low carb cheesecake with strawberries. We learned it's made with Splenda. I opted for the Fresh Banana Cheesecake. I attempted to finish it, yet I was full from the meal and most of the cheesecake. Are they the best at customer service or singing? Heck no, yet they know how to close the deal on a meal - with the Baskin Robbins of cheesecakes.

They have a board that lists all of the cheesecake flavors along with price and calorie count. Dont expect to find one under 900 calories (so worth the extra time at the gym). We waited less than 2 minutes before our cheesecake was out.  Overall a great cheesecake. There was melted marshmallow over the top of the cheesecake. It was very rich.

The restaurant seemed very clean and had nice decor and furniture for dining. The bar area looked quite classy and had a lot of seating available. A little early for drinks right? We were seated and the waitress shortly came by after. She asked what we wanted and I got 2 water with lemons and a diet coke with lemon ($3.00). She brought by the diet coke with a straw but I was surprised not to get any or be even offered straws for the water. I know its kind of picky but its the small details which reveals how your going to be served. I also asked my waitress on any recommendations which she listed some things off really fast but her menu knowledge was really lacking. I understand the menu is huge at this location, but at least recommend me a few favorites of yours unless she doesn't eat the food here which says a lot about the place. One of my big gripes was that every other table got their bread with butter and we didn't. I got a tab of $50 dollars in the end after 2 cheese cakes and 2 entrees. I was disappointed of how the skinny chicken pot pie came out. It was kind of soggy although I didnt really express my disappointment to the waitress. I don't really want to be the guy that complains unless I am really offended. The cheese cakes came out pretty decently which is why I bumped up this place to a 2 star. If it wasn't for that, I'd give it a 1 star because the sandwich, soup and salad I got also known as the Renee lunch special was not that fantastic especially for a whopping price of $13. The Renee special which allows you to either get a turkey or chicken salad sandwich, soup which I didn't get to pick or was told what kind of soup it was and either regular garden salad or a dollar more for the Caesar which I opted for. The soup was okay, which was a cream of corn with a little bit of bacon. I've had better soup while on a Navy ship. The sandwich is something I would ever crave or desire again and the salad was really less than spectacular. It lacked flavor and any amount of salt and pepper I tried putting on it didn't help. I was less than impressed with this Cheesecake factory especially with it being my first one.  Overall: I already heard bad things about this chain and my visit here only confirms it. It disappoints me more than ever since this chain is from my home state of California.

The lunch portion is HUGE! My son ordered Pepperoni pizza off the kids menu and let me tell you, the kids pizza is pretty big and it was delicious. I also love their pumpernickel bread with butter.  Today, the restaurant was still doing half off cheesecake, so of course I had 2 slices of our favorite Oreo Dream Extreme cheesecake Togo.

He even mentioned how it was national Cheesecake day and suggested some for us. I love seeing high management work side by side with their staff.

98,Shaylyn C.,"San Antonio, TX",2,8,,2.0,2017-08-01,"Very disappointing experience last night.  I love the Cheesecake Factory and have been to locations all over, but this is the worst experience I've had at one.  I gave two stars because the food tasted good, but the service was a mess. It was during national cheesecake day so it was very busy, and our server was obviously flustered and seemed new.  She did not have familiarity with the menu, and when I asked for a recommendation between two items she didn't know what I was talking about.  I have celiac, so asked for GF bread along with the bread basket.  They brought it out 10 minutes later, still frozen.  I ordered a pasta dish as my entree, with GF pasta, and when they brought it out there was regular pasta mixed in with it.  I'm glad I noticed, or it would have made me seriously ill.   They brought me a new dish, and my husband was already done with his meal before they brought it out.  The server did nothing to make up for the mistake. Those with celiac should be careful- clearly the kitchen is not being cautious about cross-contamination.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio-3?start=20,2.76,2.86,2.86,2.9520000000000004,2.82

We'll let me say that for one the food menu has way to many items on it which only proves that there's nothing fresh it's all frozen! YUK! The food was horrible and the service was way to slow we received our bread with appetizers. I think the only thing that was fresh was the cold beer I drank. My wife had the mai tai and it tasted like a 11 dollar glass of simple syrup. You would think that at least the cheese cake would be delicious right? Frozen!!!. What sad is people keep coming in this place so nothing's gonna change until y'all wise up and learn what fresh should taste like.

The table we were sat at wasn't cleaned well but I didn't say anything only because I didn't want anything done to my food. Each time the waitress came to check on us she gave us rude stares and every time I said thank you when she brought our refills she didn't acknowledge and just walked away. I was mistreated the waitress seemed to have feelings of entitlement because she was super angry when she wasn't tipped well for her poor, slow and rude service. This place has a track record of hiring criminals, shortly after my visit my car was vandalized by the staff here. I received a private message from a waitress here on Facebook telling me that's what I get for not tipping well. They talk bad about their customers as soon as they cannot hear. Don't go to this location ever if you want a nice meal with good service. They will take too long to bring your order the food doesn't even taste fresh.

We had the egg roll appetizer which gave us 2 of each. We shared the spicy chicken chipotle entree small portion was just enough for two. The sauce was actually way too sweet that we had to add a lot of salt to balance it. We ordered the Chris outrageous cheesecake to go. It taste exactly like an almond joy but much more rich.

Fried calamari $12.95  Too breaded for my taste. Just a standard calamari. Portion was a bit better.  Louisiana chicken pasta $17.95 The chicken was made perfectly. Nicely breaded and moist. Sauce was too oily, but I still enjoyed the dish. A lot of color and flavor.  If you don't have to ask for a water refill, then the service is spot on. :) Although, there needs to be some work on friendliness. But that's just being nit picky.

It was a Thursday night and dead in the place, empty tables everywhere and staff standing in corners. Our party was 6 adults and 2 kids. I've worked in the industry.

After we ordered we got our food pretty quickly. I ordered the brunch combo and substituted the pancakes for French toast. I was a little sad that they ran out of the brioche French toast even though they just opened. Everyone enjoyed their food. The eggs for me were a little under scrambled and the bacon was cooked to a dark crisp. My mother had one complaint that she requested no scallions in her omelette but it was filled with scallions.
