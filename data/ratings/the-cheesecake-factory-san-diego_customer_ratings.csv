There are so many choices and everything sounds so good that the most challenging part of visiting is choosing what to eat. I narrowed my lunch selection to the club sandwich or herb-crusted salmon and after much debate, opted for the fish. And boy was it good! The salmon was moist and tender and the mashed potatoes were wonderful. I especially loved the sauce that ringed the plate and perfectly complemented both the salmon and potatoes.  The waiter cracked me up when I asked for extra potatoes in place of the asparagus and he called me a ""reverse vegetarian."" Yep, that's right, no veggies for me!

But actually at this spot I've never really had to wait all that long despite the huge crowds that I've seen. I guess because I always opt to take first available and seem to get seated outdoors which is just fine because it's either a beautiful say in San Diego or the heat lamps are warm enough to keep me warm.

It's so much louder and crowded than the one in Valley Fair mall in Santa Clara (SF bay area). We were just 2 people so we only had to wait 15 min. there were a lot of larger groups and you can tell they've been waiting for a while.  So be prepped to wait if you got a large party. food is always delicious and consistent. our favorites are thai lettuce wrap appetizer and cajun jambalaya.

I was really excited to order the Fried Macaroni & Cheese because I've had it before and LOVED it... however that was the only thing we ordered that was good. We both ordered a drink ($13 each for a tiny martini!) and I got the Crusted Chicken Romano, she ordered the Pasta Carbonara, both off the lunch menu which has smaller portions. Both were VERY bland and lukewarm... I would rather have had the grilled cheese we ordered for my nephew off the kids menu. We both had just a couple bites of our meal and let them take our almost full plates away. The Fried Macaroni & Cheese was delicious and filled with steaming hot gooey cheese... yummy!! I should just have just ate that and skipped the pasta.

901,Leslie C.,"Concord, CA",60,147,27.0,4.0,2012-04-01,"Ahhh yes, the Cheesecake Factory. Relatively high on my list just because it's reliable (they're everywhere!), even the pickiest of eaters can find something to eat (their menu is like a novel), and the servers are always friendly. Same story at this location. We had to wait about 45 minutes for our table but that was ok since we had a large party and, to be honest, I was expecting longer since it was Saturday night. Our server was very accommodating of our wanting to split some plates, getting separate checks, and some of our party coming late. Props to her.  Two tips for anyone who hasn't yet been to a Cheesecake Factory: 1. These plates are ginormous. Don't believe me at your own peril. I always eat half of my entree and save the rest for lunch the next day. I suggest ordering something that re-heats well. 2. Don't be a dumbass, order the cheesecake. Trust me, it's pretty damn delicious and there are like 20 kinds, literally. I recommend the Chocolate Tuxedo, while one of my best friends swears by the Dulce de Leche.

927,Anura R.,"San Diego, CA",5,36,,4.0,2012-04-13,"Crowded is the best word to describe this particular Cheesecake Factory. No matter the time or day you will usually have to wait five to twenty minutes to be seated. The fact that its always packed to the brim is really my one issue with going here.  The food is good enough, the portions are gigantic (especially the cheesecakes themselves), and the menu is varied enough that almost everyone can find something to order. That said, go when you're hungry or else you'll have leftovers for a week.  The servers are, for the most part, friendly despite the fact that they are always rushing around to accommodate everyone in their sections, and there's a fifty/fifty chance that you'll wind up with one of the really sweet, talkative waitresses.  The fact that the restaurant is attached to Fashion Valley mall means that parking is almost always ample, I recommend the parking garage directly West of the main entrance or the lot just East of the front doors.  I've mixed feelings regarding the atmosphere. While I enjoy dimly lit restaurants and having barriers separating the main dining areas I hate noise, and with so many people eating here all the time noise is unavoidable.

The staff is not very helpful and you can tell that they're unsatisfied with their jobs and it definitely rubs off on the way they talk to their clientele.

They have a pretty extensive menu but I ordered the Philly Cheesesteak with fries. I was actually kind of dissapointed. The bread was good, the cheese was good, the steak was good, but it was just so greasy! The fries were pretty good. Nice and crispy. Not particularly greasy, but they are fried in oil so it didn't help the sandwich taste any better. I had the leftovers again the next day and it still didn't taste any better. I do like the free bread and butter the give you before the meal comes. It comes out nice and warm and the rye bread was the best! The sourdough was good too. Overall, I didn't like this particular meal, but we didn't have to wait to get seated and the service was okay. Maybe it's because I didn't get the cheese cake?

Not sure this is normal for a Friday night (7:30pm), but there were lots of prom night couples. Now onto the food: My wife had the ""Three Taco"" Skinnylicious dinner. She found the tacos to be excellent but the sauce was a bit too spicy for her tastes...kinda buffalo-ish. I had the meatloaf dinner.

847,Jessie F.,"San Diego, CA",15,5,,1.0,2012-06-02,"This was my third and final attempt to enjoy a cheesecake factory restaurant.  It was unsuccessful. Where to begin.  Let's start with the location.  At an overcrowded mall, the restaurant feels more like an auction house than a restaurant.  The place isn't really designed to handle nearly as many people as they seem to have on a regular basis.  As a result our party of 8 (6 adults 2 children)  was forced to stand for an hour while we awaited a table.  They do not take reservations, which we had tried to secure earlier in the day, even for large parties.  They also required managerial approval in order to combine two tables to make room for our party, which meant even getting in line took over 5 minutes.  To call this place crowded is an understatement, and to call them prepared for the amount of patrons would be a bold faced lie. So after our long wait, we were called to the front desk which had people packed around it as if it were a mosh pit, it took another 5 minutes to be seated by the hostess who wasn't quite ready for us apparently, and when we were finally seated it took another 5 minutes for our waiter to arrive and take our drink order.  Our drinks arrived without straws, which it seemed they had been rationing out to only about half of the patrons.  I ordered a Pomegranate Mojito just to tolerate the place at this point, luckily it came with a straw.  The Mojito was tolerable, it tasted watered down and was far from actually impressive, and I had no desire to order another.   Fifteen minutes later our waitress finally returned to take our order, which I'd decided on over 10 minutes earlier.  I've eaten here twice before and on both occasions I tried their seafood and wound up having food poisoning shortly thereafter, so I decided to play it safe and try to order something which I could imagine they actually couldn't screw up.  I went with a Hawaiian pizza, which has ham, pineapple, and red onions on it (literally the only ingredients) and when I ordered it the waitress informed me that it had red onions on it, just in case I wasn't capable of reading the three ingredients in the item I ordered. after another 25 minutes or so, our food began arriving in pieces, and I do mean in pieces... salad dressing for a salad here, a grilled cheese sandwich there.  When my food did arrive most of the glasses at the table were empty, and the only one which I was offered to have refilled was the Mojito, I had to request the other.  My food was serviceable, but unimpressive.  The pasta's I've tried have had the same effect, and I really don't find anything special about their food at all, especially for the price they charge for it.  I can rattle off many great restaurants around SD that have far better food for far less, but I digress.  The verdict on the pizza:  Like everything I've seen here, it seemed designed for the fattest person imaginable, Almost no pineapple on the pizza, however it was smothered in ham, so much so that I wound up picking pieces of it off to ensure I could even taste the cheese.  After completing my meal I decided to bypass dessert, which I've had before (the cheesecakes are quite overrated, other than their enormous size there's nothing spectacular about them) and asked for my check.   I was informed that they would only split the check one time, which meant I had to remain at the table until after everyone at the table had finished ordering, which included dessert, which I found to be wildly lazy and unprofessional.  For the prices at this place, I should receive better service than what I could expect at a cheap diner.  I patiently waited for my check; however.   Everyone ordered their desserts and they all arrived before the waiter even returned to see how the bill would be split, instead of splitting it after taking their order, knowing I wished to leave. When i received my bill there was an %18 gratuity automatically added, which explained my outrageous service and why they could care less.  At no point during the meal did they ask about my meal or how the food was.  Other than delivering our items, or asking for the next course, I did not see our waitress at all.  And I was thoroughly disappointed with the restaurant AGAIN.  And finally my bill came to over $70 for food which I would expect to find in any drive in diner in the midwest. The cream of the trip; however, is that last night, once again, just like my previous 2 visits, I spent most of my evening sprinting from my bed to vomit with an upset stomach.  This was my last attempt at tolerating the Cheesecake Factory and I will not be returning.  I would honestly rather eat fast food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=840,3.52,3.69,3.48,2.9160000000000004,3.6220000000000003

The sauce is delicious and the pasta could not be prepared any better.  The only downside to this place is that they do not take reservations and the place is usually crazy busy on the weekends, so it would be wise to plan accordingly unless you are planning on waiting for a minimum of 45 minutes for a table.

Saying that much, if you're coming here during dinner rush and expecting to get seated quickly AND then come on yelp to complain about it...well...let's just say I'm laughing at you and not with you. Come here for an early lunch (when they open) or for an earlier dinner before 6pm. It's been a few years since I've come to this location, but we arrived at 5:30 and got seated right away. We tried the Stuffed Mushrooms. I enjoyed that my appetizer actually came before the main dish. So many of these chain restaurants get that part wrong. Anyways, they were pretty decent. The wine and parmesan flavors complemented each other, but it was a tad bit on the salty side. They added a ""skinny"" menu for people who want to be calorie cautious...although nothing on the menu seems to be lower than 600 calories. Nonetheless, I tried the Skinnylicious Chicken Salad Sandwich. I enjoyed it as it was light on the mayo. The bread was lightly toasted and quite tasty. I'm ate only a third of the salad, but that's not because it was bad. I'm just not a fan of arugula and endive. It came with a standard vinaigrette.  My husband got the Teriyaki Chicken dish. He enjoyed it quite a bit. And like everyone has been saying...the portions are HUGE. I took a bite and it was tasty as well...all the tang and sweetness expected in a teriyaki dish. I didn't finish my sandwich and left some room for cake. How could we not have some?! We went for the 30th Anniversary cake. It was pretty decadent.

The experience feels slightly more elegant. The best part of Cheesecake Factory though, are the cheesecakes. I've had good pastas, and Chinese Chicken salad here. My experience with their other foods....not so good. We got the buffalo chicken wings as an appetizer, they were just ordinary wings I could have bought frozen and reheated from Costco. It came with 3 sticks of celery. We also tried the Steak Diane with Salmon combo - it was medallions of beef sauteed in a too strong sauce with mushrooms. How do I describe the sauce....too sweet, too savory...too much, not right. The salmon tasted overcooked and mushy. The few sprigs of asparagus it came with were a little hard on the bottom. The Steak Diane and Scampi combo was the same, only the Scampi was 3 lone shrimps cooked in an oily, too creamy sauce...the basil and tomato were cooked right in and much overdone. I could not taste it, and by cooking in the sauce that way, it didn't taste fresh. The combos are really not worth it. They don't do meat right.

The food exceeded expectations and the shared Coconut chocolate cheese cake was very good.   The cheese cake is a bit overrated(once you've had the best NY cheesecake  anywhere else is hard to beat) however the CC Factory versions are  decent.  Try the ""Skinnylicious"" menu--for relatively lighter fare.

863,Michael L.,"Arcadia, CA",112,262,30.0,2.0,2012-07-31,"This Cheesecake Factory sadly disappointed me. I've never been taken care of so poorly at a Cheesecake Factory, and the Cheesecakes I had that day were subpar for sure. I came with two of my friends, and all of us were quite excited for their annual National Cheesecake Day with half-off Cheesecakes. The first thing we had was the bread. As thankful as I was that it was hot, the bread tasted worse than the other ones I've had in the past. Their rye bread doesn't have quite as much flavor or sweetness as what I've been used to. We each followed up with a lunch-sized portion of their pasta, getting Pasta Da Vinci and Louisiana Chicken Pasta. I had forgotten how much smaller their lunch portions are. It should still fill the average appetite, but their dinner portions may be almost twice the size of their lunch portions. Their pasta tasted the same as the others, so I was quite thankful for that. If you do plan on coming here for pasta, the two pastas we ordered are definitely the ones I would recommend. We concluded our meal with two slices of cheesecakes, their Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel and their Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake. Both were mediocre. The Dutch Apple tasted as if it's been sitting out for days. The streusel and crust was extremely soggy and the cheesecake looked as if the middle deflated. Disappointing considering this is normally a $7 slice of cheesecake. The Lemon Raspberry Cheesecake, was lacking in fruit flavors and was not as dense as I expect New York style Cheesecake to be. It could be that they mass produced these cheesecakes more than usual in preparation for the event, thus lowering the quality of their overpriced cheesecakes. For the normal price, I'd recommend going elsewhere for dessert. The waitress for my table did nothing to make our table feel any better about the meal. She pretty much ignored our table, perhaps noting that it was merely three college students. The waitress didn't fill my water cup up once, nor did she notice the times we tried waving her over. It literally took me to wave and speak up an ""excuse me!"" in order to get her attention. Another time we thought she saw us as she walked over, but instead she just put her back against us while she talked to the table next to us. Honestly, would it hurt you to pay more attention to us? Overall, the food was nothing special - if anything it's overpriced and lacking in flavor. Their cheesecakes were not nearly as great as I remembered. I don't think I'll be coming back to this Cheesecake Factory again.

We went in around lunch time (12pm) and after we were seated, our waitress came over and greeted us. However, she did not bother giving us her name or anything. She simply just handed us our menus and left.  For entrees, we had their Pasta Da Vinci and their Louisiana Chicken pasta. My friend's Pasta Da Vinci was about 1/4th smaller than my boyfriend's Pasta Da Vinci. I'm guessing they are not really consistent in terms of how much food they plate each time. I had their Louisiana Chicken pasta and it was a bit too flavorful and salty for my taste. The chicken was also really really thin - almost a sliver.  The worst part of my experience was our waitress. She was never around and was not really friendly towards us. In addition, she never offered to refill our water cups and because it was so hard for us to find her, we eventually did not even bother asking.  When it came time for dessert, we ordered two cheesecakes and it took out waitress almost 10 minutes to get them. I am not sure why plating two cheesecakes would take ten minutes but it somehow did.

697,Dan P.,"San Diego, CA",65,303,3.0,1.0,2012-08-01,"Let me preface by saying that I don't like Cheesecake and I only went here because of a birthday dinner for my GF's sister. Waited 90 minutes for a table (why the heck don't these idiots at this kind of Chain restaurant take reservations?) on a MONDAY night because it was ""national cheesecake day"" even though no such thing actually exists.  Sat down and the waiter was quite friendly, but the table was a cheap outdoor one with really uncomfortable seats.   I ordered the Chicken Di Pana with a side of ""cheesy"" grits.  It also came with Broccoli.  Even though the plate was the size of a small table, the serving size of food itself was not exactly anything special.  The chicken was bland and flavorless, and despite the appearance of the breading, it was not in any way crunchy, which suggests to me that it was made earlier and then microwaved.  The broccoli was barely cooked and without any kind of flavor whatsoever. The ""grits"" were a joke.  They were honestly closer to Baby food than Grits.  There were actual corn pieces in it and yet no actual GRIT.  Seriously, it was corn-flavored mush with a few corn kernals and no taste of cheese.  Compare to the cheesy grits at ""The Americana"" in Del Mar and there is no comparison and they are the same price...and ""The Americana"" has better food. Oh yeah, and the manager said that because of the high demand for Cheesecake that night that they had to get the order for Cheesecakes 20 minutes in advance so they could be transported from the bakery...Hmm, I thought this was a cheesecake FACTORY.  Doesn't that imply that the cheesecakes are made in house? Overpriced, over-crowded, not-very-good food, SLOW service (the guy was nice, but my water sat empty for the last half of the meal and we spent 15 minutes trying to flag him down to get the check and takeout boxes) means 1 star.

1374,Kaylee H.,"San Diego, CA",21,188,41.0,3.0,2012-08-08,"Cuz and I went to the CF for lunch today as kind of a special ""lunch before she has a baby and her life is over"" kind of thing.  The last gasp, as it were. I have to preface my review by saying that I really do not like Fashion Valley.  The stores are overpriced, the people working in said stores and snotty beotches, and there is NO PARKING.  The only time I venture to this devil's den is to go to PF Chang's and The Container Store.  My love of PF Chang's trumps any issues I have with this Faux Beverly Hills Mall.  As does my love of organization.  But I've never had trouble finding parking when going to PF Chang's or The Container Store, because they're on the fringe of the madness I guess. So after driving up and down and up and down the aisles of the parking structure (silly me, I thought we'd be able to park in the covered lot so the car wasn't hot as the surface of the sun when we returned), I threw in the towel and parked on the top deck, in the sun.  Should've brought a brisket and left it on the front seat, I wouldn't have had to cook dinner tonight. We walk over to CF.  And let me just add here that, the architects of the parking structure (on the north side of the mall along Friars) didn't take into account that people might want to walk from the structure to the restaurant, and not directly into the mall.  To get to the restaurant (or PF Chang's or The Container Store) one has to walk across the busy street and walk a bit and then cross again to the other side when the sidewalk finally begins, or risk one's life by walking in the street.  And hey, even though it's a small street inside the mall parking, people drive like it's Indy for crissakes.  And it's exacerbated by the valet parking doods who figure it's worth risking their lives and the lives of men, women, and children to get a good tip.  Whatever. We enter CF and it is packed.  Here's what I am thinking:  Don't these people work???  Surely they can't all be spoiled unemployed wives like Cuz and I.  Happily though we were seated very quickly.  Unhappily, the tables are thisclosetogether.  If you're into privacy (and being able to actually hear your meal-mate), forget this place.  The reason I give this place three stars is for their ""Skinnylicious Menu.""  I LOVE IT.  I love eating at restaurants that go the extra mile for the odd duck who wants to eat healthy (me).  The menu is long and has lots of yummy, and relatively low caloric, appetizers, entrees, and even cocktails.  Gotta love that!  I had the Skinnylicious Pear and Endive Salad, with Grilled Chicken, Endive, Radicchio, Arugula, Butter Lettuce, Roasted Pear, Blue Cheese, Candied Pecans and Tomato Served with a Low-Cal Vinaigrette.  It could've used some larger pecans but I know they're trying to stay under a certain calorie count.  Cuz had Chicken Lettuce Wrap Tacos.  We both had iced tea which was very refreshing on this stinkin hot day in August. The waiter brought us some bread and here's where points are deducted from the initial five-stars:  Bread that is not warm, with cold hard butter.  What am I supposed to do with that?  This country doesn't know enough about how wonderful bread is when it's hot and the butter is smooth because if they did there would be rioting in the streets to correct the injustice and shame of cold bread/frozen butter.  Either warm the bread, or serve whipped butter.  Come on people. Waiter was fine, not great, just fine.  Service was not speedy but not an unusually long wait. Bottom line:  I would return to eat at CF if they had locations other than this mall, but the mall, the parking, and the wait all add up to:  Probably won't return to this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=1040,3.32,3.69,3.52,3.0200000000000005,3.5420000000000003

Service: It was definitely a whole lot better than before. There were people overflowing out the door waiting for a table. I put in my reservation for 2 and the wait was roughly 30 so they say. I took a walk around the mall and came back and to my surprise the line disseminated. We got a seat right away and the service pleasant. Food: The food was surprisingly delicious. Ordered the Chicken Samosas and to my surprise it was very tastely and wasn't too americanized from the traditional samosas. This version has just a hint of curry, enough to tantalize the tongue. I had the meatloaf entree and it was surpisingly hearty and good. There was 3 one-inch slices of meatloaf with a side of corn veggie medley and mashed potatoes.  Drinks: I just had water, but they serve beer and wine too. Overall:  To my surprise I have been rejuvenated that this restaurant chain made a complete 180 from its opening days. This place use to be an overrated joint serving over-priced salads, pastas, and entrees. Its a whole lot better now with better food, portions, and ambiance. Not too shabby.

443,Faye L.,"San Diego, CA",515,1213,8810.0,4.0,2012-09-18,"Enough reviews and pics have been posted on this. Here is what I order almost EVERY SINGLE TIME: Avocado Eggrolls:  Avocado, Sun-Dried Tomato, Red Onion and Cilantro Fried in a Crisp Wrapper. Served with a Tamarind-Cashew Dipping Sauce - *mind blowing*. Words cannot describe how awesome this dish is. Even if you hate avo, try this dish. It might just convert you. Their tamarind dipping sauce is stupid good Shrimp Scampi and Chicken Madeira : Our famous Shrimp Scampi sautéed with whole cloves of garlic, white wine, fresh basil and tomato AND Sautéed chicken breast topped with fresh asparagus & melted mozzarella cheese and fresh mushroom Madeira Sauce. - the sauces for BOTH these dishes make this *THE* best entree here. I crave this dish like no other.  So a few side notes: Ordered TO GO for first time few weeks ago... - person taking order was nice and efficient - there is supposed to be reserved designated spots for Cheesecake factory customers picking up food. ALL 3 spots were taken. I saw 1 spot being taken by lame loverbird teenage couple grabbing subway or something in the mall. The other 2 spots were taken by handicap drivers (I didn't know this but if you have a decal, you can park anywhere that says reserved?). - someone will come out to your car and give you receipt. You then give them your credit card, they go back inside to process, and then come out to get your signature and tip - the to go order of my combo scampi shrimp and chicken Madeira was really nicely done. It looked and tasted awesome. They also packaged extra sauce for me per my request - the bread that came w/ it was nice as well Here's my gripe: - ordered low carb cheesecake. Didn't want strawberries on it. They put strawberries on there but the girl that came out to take my credit card said they didn't charge me extra for berries. Came home and 1) cheesecake looked AWFUL + puny ; 2) the berries that came with it looked old and over riped and 3) they charged me for the berries I didn't want. The presentation was terrible.  If you've been to CF before, the cheesecake section is separate from kitchen. They usually bust out the dessert orders pretty fast. I put the blame on them, and them alone, for the cheesecake disaster.  I called the manager to voice my concern as we had driven 25 min one way to get our order. I just told him it was disappointing to get such a sad cheesecake b/c we've always been so happy w/ our food there. He was a bit defensive and asked 'did you eat the cheesecake, wasn't it ok'. And I said no, we haven't touched it, we're staring at it right now. He took the item off the bill (haven't confirmed yet) which we appreciated. I told him that we really loved what the kitchen produced but that he should tell the cheesecake prep girls to take more pride in what they put out. Anyhow, the low carb cheesecake tasted terrible. The crust is really gritty tasting. I'd rather run 20 miles and then treat myself to one of their full carb slices of cheesecakes next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=440,3.04,3.54,3.492,2.8320000000000003,3.3400000000000007

1036,Annie L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,63,,1.0,2012-10-04,"It was my first time dining at this location and it will also be my last. Six of us came here to celebrate my best friend's birthday, but I will speak for myself in this review.  My experience at this restaurant progressively worsened throughout the night.  After being seated, our waiter, Matthew, greeted us in a melancholy manner and remained impersonal and robotic the entire time.  He was not interested in creating a great dining experience; he seemed to question our satisfaction only out of protocol, not genuine concern. The birthday girl decided to order a cocktail, and as she was reaching for her ID, I told our waiter it was her birthday.  He nodded without a word or a smile and just stood there, waiting for her ID.  Don't people usually wish others a Happy Birthday out of courtesy?  When we asked if he could take a picture for us, he simply stuck his palm out, without a word, waiting for one of us to hand him a camera.  Is it wrong for me to assume waiters/waitresses should be personable and verbal considering they encounter people every day?  Our waiter was impatient and lacked interpersonal skills.  He made us feel unwelcomed and acted as if we were inconveniencing him. To top it off, our waiter did not take directions well when it came time to pay.  Our bill was $146.45 (gratuity included).  We paid $90 in cash and asked him to charge two cards with $29 each, totaling $148.  He did not bring us back our receipt or our change from our cash payment and somehow added a $4 tip on top of each $29 credit card charge.  When we explained his error to him, he did not apologize.  All he said was, ""I'll give you your $2.""  I was insulted and repulsed by his nonchalance and his lack of remorse. At the end of our meal, I calmly addressed my concerns with the Manager, Chuck, but even he proved unhelpful and offered no sense of concern for our discontent.  My experience at this location was contradictory to The Cheesecake Factory's company mission: ""To create an environment where absolute guest satisfaction is our highest priority.""  Our waiter dampened our spirits on what should have been a festive and fun night.  The service and experience I received singlehandedly shattered my positive image of The Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=960,3.32,3.57,3.492,2.244,3.47

We windowshopped and then decided to come back after 25 minutes and still had to wait about 10-15 minutes more.

I was expecting more salad greens on my plate, but it was mostly just tomatoes and cucumbers. I also got the Crab and Artichoke dip, which was actually really good! It was a perfect blend of flavors.

I don't know if my standards went up or something is wrong with this place but I seriously wanted to walk out of the restaurant in the middle of the dinner!!! I have been to Cheesecake Factory in SF, Palo Alto and LA...but SD has the worst food and services ever! First of all, the bread that they served wasn't warm... that's okay. It's not a big deal to me. Then, I ordered a passion fruit mojito ... when I took my first sip ... yikes I just taste syrup... the mint wasn't crushed... it's just flowing on my glass... so I told the server that this is tasting right to me ... his response was ""it can't be wrong because it was made by their recipe!!"" However, they offered to change my drink, so I decide to go with the regular mojito because I thought maybe the passion fruit flavor is supposed to be sweeter. When I got my regular mojito, all I tasted was just sprite and again the mint wasn't crushed... I wasn't the only person felt the same way. Something is wrong with their ""recipe""!  My bf got the bang bang chicken and shrimp... the server asked him if he wants white or brown rice... he goes with the brown. Of course, the plate came out with white rice!!! I ordered the garlic noodle with shrimp... the pasta was so dry and I seriously think I can make the same stuff... don't understand why it cost $17. During the meal, I was watching them how they set up their table... seriously... I can't eat my food anymore. There were trash all over the floor and they didn't even care to clean them.

Between the beautifully toasted buns, the huge pile of mushrooms, juicy beef, and two types of cheese made this hamburger one of the best I've ever tasted.

We arrived on Saturday night, December 29 around 7:20 pm and waited an hour an 45 minutes before begin seated. No problem, we were willing to wait. We spent the time waiting for our dinner table in the bar area. Our bartender was Tracy, a very personable and helpful bartender, 5 stars for him. We then were seated at our table, our waiter was very attentive and nice. The food was great. We ate our entrees, ordered dessert and that's where the experience goes south.  We were seated at a 2 person table with a four person table to my right and a 2 person table to our left. As we received our dessert, the apparent manager on duty seats a partial party of 8 on either side of us with the remaining 2 diners from the new party left hovering around waiting for us to leave. The tables on either side of us are now having conversations over us as we eat our dessert. We didn't even have our check yet.  One of the waitresses serving the area actually points out to the manager (dark brown or black hair wearing a maroon dress shirt and I think they were grey or khaki colored slacks) that it is not right to seat this party while we are still eating, and he yells at her. SHE WAS RIGHT. The manager is having this conversation with the concerned waitress directly behind me, offers no apology for the fact that we now have 2 tables of people talking over us, pushing for us to leave, never mind the grown men a few feet away leering at us as if we are in the wrong. It's unfortunate that the last 15 minutes of our evening ruined the experience, but it is an honest assessment and deserved based on the poor judgment exercised by the manager, perhaps he should receive some more training.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=1000,2.92,3.24,3.408,2.6320000000000006,3.1120000000000005

We had to flag down various servers and busboys to take our order, refill drinks, provide our check and run the check. 4 of the 5 meals came out together and we were asked if we wanted to have our food delivered as is, without the sauce so that we could all eat together... Uhh, seriously??! Did I order the dish without sauce? No. So why would I do that because you are incapable of having everything ready at the same time? Such a weird experience and a disappointing birthday for the family. I went to see a manager after the meal and was again let down by how dismissive he was, stating that the food did not come out at the same time because of kitchen issues.

1153,Foster B.,"Chicago, IL",0,3,,1.0,2013-02-06,"Let me start off by saying I'm a huge CF fan. Their restaurants typically have wonderful food and ambiance for group gatherings. Which is why I wanted to bring a group to the one in San Diego. We were attending a conference nearby and I was hosting a late night gathering. I called 1.5 months ahead to find out how to reserve a room since they state, ""We can serve groups up to 40.""  They asked me to call back 2 weeks before the event since ""We don't take reservations."" Reasonable request. I did so and that time they asked me to call back a few days before the event because, ""We don't take reservations."" Again - reasonable request. I did so ... again.... and they said that bringing a group of 15-20 at around 9:30 pm wouldn't be a problem and ""We don't take reservations.""  When we arrived at 9:30, we encountered a mildly irritated staff. When I tried to explain that I called ahead to alert them so make sure they wouldn't be put out by a large late-night group, I heard one more time... ""We don't take reservations.""

Our waiter was one of the best and most attentive waiters I've had in a long time. I also love that the menu is so huge. There's literally any kind of food you could want to eat.  The food was tasty, with big portions, and of course the cheesecake was heavenly. However, my boyfriend didn't love that the cobb salad (while gigantic and overall good) was all shredded lettuce instead of actual leaves. It was just a step up from the lettuce you would get at Subway.

463,Tim S.,"Surprise, AZ",112,1124,1499.0,3.0,2013-02-09,"3.5 stars.  Solid! This is my wifes favorite place in the world.  We had a gift card and decided to come down here for lunch today.  This place is a giant cluster F.  We put our names in and had to wait for about 25 minutes to be seated.  We did get a booth in a section away from all the madness so that was cool.  This is what we ordered and how they stacked up. Appetizer-  Avocado egg rolls.  These things were great.  My wifes friend always gets them and until today, I had never had one.  They are egg roll wrappers stuffed with avocado and some other stuff.  They were pretty freaking tasty.  $9.99 tasty?  Eh... debatable.  Cuban Sandwich-  You cant find Cuban sandwiches at most places.  It sounded good so I thought I would give it a shot.  It turned out to be awesome!  The bread was good (not a traditional Cuban sandwich bread), the pork, ham, cheese and pickles melded together.  It was a really good sandwich.  It also comes with a little cup of fries.  They salt the hell out of them (thank goodness....I hate places that dont salt their fries) and they were really hot, crispy and tasty.  Some real good fries.  I would definitely get this sandwich and fries again. Pizza and Caesar salad lunch special-  My wife got this one.  It comes with a large sized salad and a personal/small pizza.  The pizza was just meh.  The crust was way way way way too thin and it was droopy and greasy.  The taste was alright but the crust was so badly messed up it took away from how good it usually is ...so says my wife. Dessert-  We went with the Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake.  Holy mother of GOD!  This thing was possibly the best chocolate dessert I have ever encountered.  This thing was a massive slice!  Here is the description straight from their website    "" OREO® Cookies baked in our creamy Cheesecake with layers of fudge cake and OREO® Cookie mousse. Topped with a milk chocolate icing.""  This thing was so creamy and chocolatey and rich and decadent.  Chocolate fudge, cheesecake, Oreos, cake, whipped cream etc....it was flat out amazing.  I may have to come back very very soon just to grab a slice of this awesomeness.  Overall, the food was very good.  A few things keep it from being rated higher than it should IMO.  Its always way too busy and the wait is long.  Its expensive too.  Even with our $25.00 gift card, the total after tax and tip still came out to $37.00.  Basically a $62.00 lunch.  That did include the appetizer and dessert but that is still a little expensive for lunch.  At the end of the day, that Oreo cheesecake was worth the price of admission alone.  If you have a sweet tooth and love chocolate/Oreos, head on down immediately and grab yourself a slice of heaven!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=380,3.2,3.19,3.456,2.9560000000000004,3.194
772,Rachel E.,"Hillcrest, San Diego, CA",83,49,9.0,2.0,2013-02-11,"We went to The Cheesecake Factory on Sunday because we had a $50 gift card.  We've been here before several times, but probably wouldn't have gone back if it wasn't for the gift card. PROS:  The cheesecake is good, and apparently they make a really good burger. The service is decent and helpful. CONS:  Parking at Fashion Valley for a Sunday Lunch is a PAIN.   There is a lot of waiting in order to get to the table part of the experience.   There are TONS of people.  Don't go if you don't like crowds. The décor is something I try not to look at. If you're an indecisive person, it will take you 20 minutes to decide what to get off their extensive menu. The drinks are overpriced. ---------------------------------------------- ENVIRONMENT & SERVICE: It's a chore to get into Cheesecake Factory for lunch on the weekend.  It was just 2 of us, so our wait was about 20 minutes.  We scored bar seats, and could have ordered our food right there, but decided to get a drink and wait for a table.  Our total was $17 and some change (not including tip), which I think is steep for the cheapest glass of pinot noir on the menu and a Stone IPA.  We knew from prior experience not to waste our time with the mixed drinks - it's a minimum $10 per drink and always a stingy pour. You know that feeling when you've been waiting for a table, and you're hungry, and you're a bit miffed because you just put down a $20 bill for a beer & a glass of wine, and then that little indicator starts lighting up and you know it's your turn to sit down?  It's an exciting feeling, even for a little thing like that.  But at The Cheesecake Factory, there's no Sarah or Alison or Jennifer to greet you with a smile as you walk back to the foyer, saying ""right this way!""   Instead, there's a hostess fortress where they take your buzzer back, saying ""please wait over here for your name to be called.""  Wait a second, isn't that what I just did? Isn't that what the buzzer means?!?  Nope.  Not at the Cheesecake Factory.  I was just extracted from my comfy seat at the bar, and placed into the ""elite"" waiting pool, where I spent another 5 minutes crammed against the side of the wall, trying to stay out of the way of the servers running between the kitchen and the cheesecake counter, and suspiciously eyeing those around me to see who will make the second cut. Our server, thankfully, was attentive but not overbearing, not memorable but efficient, which is sometimes just what you want.  He recommended the burger, which was a good call, and boxed our leftovers up quickly, and didn't mind when we just sat for a little while trying to digest the mess in our stomachs after we paid. THE FOOD: There's bread to start (the brown squaw bread is great!), but with cold butter patties, which is always something that peeves Shawn Michael.  You can't spread cold butter.  I know this place is a ""factory"" of food, so they have to keep their butter cold during storage, and there's such a huge turnover of guests that it's likely unfeasible to thaw butter in accurate quantities to a spreadable consistency... but we both wish someone would try to figure it out.   We got the Buffalo Blasts- in all their creamy, savory, crispy glory.  This is what you think when you first bite into one, and by the second, you're thinking about how many calories are packed into one of the deep-fried pockets of gooey goodness.  Perhaps more frightening than the near-300 calories for each Blast is that each one is also loaded with over 1,000 mg of sodium... and we hadn't even arrived at the main course. Shawn Michael had the Smokehouse BBQ Burger, and I had the Monte Cristo Sandwich.  The Monte Cristo was just OK... The bread could have been crispier, and I hate it when all the insides are piled in the center of the sandwich- I shouldn't have to re-distribute the contents in order to have more than one good bite out of each sandwich wedge.  Shawn said his burger was REALLY good.  It made it to his top 10 list of San Diego Burgers, so that's saying something. And we had the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake-this velvety, creamy, melt-in-your-mouth dessert does not disappoint.  We had it at our wedding, so that's saying something! CONCLUSION Even while I enjoyed (for the most part) my indulgent food episode, while I was savoring my last bite I said with a smile, ""Can we please never come here again?""  Perhaps it's the thousands of calories I ingest effortlessly, or the crowds and overpriced drinks... but it makes me feel a bit like I'm waiting in line for a fried Oreo at the fair. Now that I think of it, my reaction to the Cheesecake Factory is strikingly similar to my reaction to the San Diego County Fair.  However, I shouldn't think ""fair"" when I go to a restaurant. I guess the upside is that my experience has satisfied that bit of cultural longing; I might just skip the trip to Del Mar this June!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=720,3.2,3.16,3.444,2.8560000000000003,3.1760000000000006

718,Vi N.,"San Diego, CA",128,9,5.0,1.0,2013-03-17,"Someone please enlighten me because I  can not understand how this place manages to have 3.5 stars. You're paying Benecotto/Cucina Urbana prices (both 4+ stars on yelp) for Olive Garden (and possibly even Chef Boyardee) quality food. Hell, you can go to Cucina Charisma in Hillcrest (4.5stars) and pay a fraction of the price. I JUST DON'T GET IT! I mean, I know this is the Cheesecake Factory, and that it's a chain, but I do expect some minimal level of edibility.  I ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta (with grilled chicken instead of breaded) to go via curb side pick up. This review will deconstruct the dish and elaborate on everything thing wrong with it and possibly this establishment in general.  First, the chicken was burnt. No, I apologize, it wasn't merely burnt, it was BUUURRRRNNNTTT.  As such, the chicken breast bore more semblance to burnt hamburger patties than it did to chicken. Also, usually when one properly cooks chicken, you let it rest before tampering with, so to ensure that the flavor doesn't drain from the meat. I don't think the cooks adhered to this. Instead, I believed they butchered that chicken breast immediate, without giving it the chance to sit. I mean, this is something so elementary that a chef (or amateur home cook) should know about.  Consequently, the meat itself was dry. Furthermore, the dry and nasty-ness of the chicken breast was exacerbated by the fact that the burnt outside gave the breast a gritty, bitter taste. Second, the pasta was bland. I've recreated a similar dish at home, so I know the potential it has. Anyway, back to the blandness. As a ""southern"" dish, I was expecting more bold flavors - you know, some thyme, cumin, paprika, cayenne, parsley, all that good stuff. Instead, what I got was bowtie pasta with minimal butter and maybe some cream. In order to salvage the dish, I decided to salt and pepper the life out of the dish, but to no avail. It's likely that all the salt they used to de-ice DC after the snowstorm would not have been sufficient to salvage this dish.  Third, there was no red or yellow bell peppers as the menu suggested. I'm sure the addition of such ingredients would have helped with the blandness problem.  Fourth, doesn't anyway find their menu tacky. Why are there advertisements?  Anyway, needless to say, after two bites (one of the chicken and one of the pasta), I threw it away. What a waste of $20 dollars ($18 for the dish and $2 tip I gave to the curb side pick up girl)!   The management really needs to more closely inspect the quality of food they are serving. Basic skills are obviously lacking (i.e., taste the food you're putting out to see if it's properly season, look at the protein to see if it actually resembles what you're trying to serve, etc.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=680,3.16,3.08,3.42,2.468,3.1120000000000005

Just think of all that cheesecake.  Endless fatty, chocolatey goodness, gradually hardening your arteries until you drop dead from acute myocardial infarction. Sounds lovely, huh? That's why, instead of ordering a mountain of cheesecake, I spent my $100 on two consecutive brunches filled with salad and white wine. Don't get me wrong -- salad at the Cheesecake Factory isn't ""healthy"" per se, but it's still better than the alternatives filling up their War & Peace-length menu. Over the course of two brunches, I pretty much ran the gamut of Cheesecake Factory's salad menu.  Here's the list of what I tried: ** Tuna tataki salad -- seared tuna, avocado, mixed greens, tomato ** Chicken tostada salad -- grilled chicken, tortillas, black beans, corn, onions, cilantro ** Carlton salad -- romaine lettuce, grilled chicken, feta, avocado, cranberries, pears, orange ** BBQ ranch chicken salad -- chicken, avocado, tomato, cucumber, onion strings It figures that the salad I liked the *least* (the tuna tataki -- fairly bland) is the healthiest.  In fact, that one is on Cheesecake Factory's ""SkinnyLicious"" menu, meaning it's under 500 calories, so you can enjoy it without guilt.  (Unfortunately, every time I see the word ""SkinnyLicious"" in print, I gag a little.)   Likewise, the best of these salads in the least healthy (the BBQ ranch chicken salad -- very flavorful and satisfying).  It just goes to show that trying to eat healthy at the Cheesecake Factory is a lost cause indeed.   You can't go wrong with the chicken tostada or Carlton salads, either.

It had like a raw texture to it, but it looked cooked. It was good because I love rotisserie chicken but for $15, I could've bought 3 big whole chicken from costco. Nothing special about this dish at all. My awesome mashed potatoes could beat cheesecake factory's any day. His: Factory burger (around $10) - It was served in a baguette which I found pretty weird.

It had bavarian cream on top and the cheesecake filling tasted like bananas w/ fresh cut up bananas. It was yummy! and now the bf's favorite.  Now, the reason why I only gave this 3 stars wasnt just because of the average food. It was also our server. Wasnt friendly at all and had a little snooty attitude. No extra tip for that guy!

My sister's plate was grabbed by another waitress, forcing her to wait another 10 minutes while they cooked her another. Despite talking to the manager about the mistake, no actions were taken to make the situation better. We were promised a free slice of cheesecake to make up for it, but it never came. We had a party of seven and despite advertising that they can accommodate parties up to 40, we were stuck at a booth that seated 6 and simply placed a chair at the end of the table in the pathway for our other member to sit in. The waiter we had was quite snooty with us, and did not pay very much attention to our requests. One such instance was the splitting of the checks. He had to come back to us to re-split it twice. A mandatory gratuity charge of 18% is automatically added to the check for parties of six or larger, which seemed a little unusual considering most restaurants force gratuity with parties of eight or more. Most of our party paid with their bank cards while I chose to pay in cash. We never received our receipt, nor the change from our payment, which was very unsettling for myself and my wife considering that the tip had already been taken out of the check. No receipt and they stole our change on top of that. It was only a few cents, but still, it was stealing.

He hears me rave about it constantly so it was about time!! Unfortunately we went on a Saturday night so there was quite a wait, but I knew that was to be expected. I've visited this location during both busy and quiet times, and usually the quality of food is not affected either way. However, it appears as though the rush affected our food BIG time. Our appetizer (buffalo blasts) was the only thing that came out hot - too hot, in fact. They were soooo crunchy and overcooked! My spicy cashew chicken came out cold about 35 minutes later, and it was also about half the portion that I'm used to with this dish. What?! Is my memory just failing me?! The flavor also seemed...saltier? Maybe it's because I cook my own version of this  that I've become accustomed to. *Shrug* I enjoyed it regardless, but my boyfriend DESPISED his dish. He ordered a burger with bacon and fried mac and cheese on top, which sounded incredible to both of us. He said that the mac and cheese totally ruined the burger though - the cold, grainy gas station nacho-type cheese sunk into all the other ingredients and completely turned him off. I encouraged him to stop eating, split my dish, and voice his opinion to our server but we were so hungry after an hour and a half wait before we even got seated (and then over another hour wait for our entrees) that he was just over it. First time I've ever seen anyone unsatisfied with what they ordered, and my boyfriend isn't even as harsh a critic as me! I feel awful changing my rating since I am such a huge fan of this place (and our Reese's cheesecake to go was fab-u-LOUS) but this was a seriously subpar dining experience.

I still do (unconditionally) love the avocado egg rolls but just about everything else seems to have gone way downhill.  The half chicken was at one point of time one of my faves but the last time I ordered it, it was bland and certainly lived up to the rule of ""don't order the chicken."" I loved ordering the chicken! The prices can no longer be justified with such a decrease in quality but the service has always been nothing short of fantastic. Besides the time the manager blew me off with a ""what do you want me to do about it"" answer when dealing with an undercooked pork chop, I can't complain about anyone who has ever touched the table during any of my visits. Training in the front of house still seems to be a priority but behind the scenes has definitely suffered. It's a shame to see a restaurant that at one time aimed for excellence regardless of their size to take such a turn.

I don't mind taking it out, but I'd rather not waste food like that. The third time I went I got their fettucini alfredo with chicken. Not a whole lot of chicken, like a few pieces and the noodle tasted like it wasn't fully cooked? The noodles weren't soft, they were a little hard. The sauce was really rich though.

336,Caleb T.,"Encinitas, CA",90,396,826.0,4.0,2013-06-02,"I try to make it a point that whenever I review a chain restaurant, I only write the negative reviews; because, seriously, why would I bother saying, 'the Sausage Biscuit at Burger King is to die for!  Four stars, King!' It is, by the way.  That place is a complete shit hole where good taste goes to die in a festering cesspool of its own waste while baking under a constant and sweltering noon day sun.  But the sausage biscuit ain't bad... DON'T JUDGE ME! But, I digress.  Cheesecake Factory, I come here every once in a while, invariably with extended family for either a loving get-together or to cushion a sudden shock, and every time I'm always satisfied and impressed by whatever we get. Sure, the wait times can be insane, we got there at 6:00 on a Friday night and weren't seated until after 7:00, but it's kinda worth it.  This last time around, my girlfriend and I split a Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad and the Chicken Madeira. The salad was extremely fresh with a great and flavorful salsa garnish.  Despite the moisture of all the ingredients, the tostada shell below stayed crisp and deliciously salty.  And the chicken was well grilled, cooked to order, despite a crappy salad like you would get over at P.F. Changs. With the Chicken Madeira, the chicken itself was fairly breaded and moist, but it's the mushroom sauce that graces the top of it that really makes the dish.  Paired with Chessecake Factory's mashed red potatoes and grilled asparagus, and both of us were happily fed. Around the table was an Herb Crusted Salmon, simple but tasty.  Cashew Chicken, the only disappointment (a very mild one, at that) in my opinion.  FIsh and Chips, a staple of most restaurants that this one does a good interpetation of.  And Chicken Di Pana, that had a butter sauce that was surprisingly delicious. And then there's their namesake, the Chesecake.  Even the worst of cheesecake is pretty damn good; and the cheesecake here rests comfortably on the opposite side of that spectrum.  About the only complaint about the desserts, is that there aren't any that strain the realm of originality.  No chances are taken, about the biggest stray from the comfort of the tamest of palettes would be a salted caramel cheesecake (yes, Virginia, salt and sugar do go well together)... So, c'mon, don't hate too much on this franchise food stop in any upscale mall.  If anything, grab yourself a slice of Oreo Cheesecake for the car ride home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=340,2.72,2.98,3.344,3.2800000000000002,2.8760000000000003

This time's experience goes as follows: My bud and I arrive and are told 25 minute wait.  There are like 20 people waiting, we find that to be hard to believe but it seems like a decent wait time so we agree. I couldn't tell you how long we waited but we had so much to catch up on that honestly, I didn't think it took more than the 25 minutes. Our buzzer goes off and we hand it to the hostess, then she tells us to wait in a line for our number to be called! WHAT?! Anyway, we were called within about a minute and a half or so...I thought it was odd that they'd call us to wait in another line but whatevz. So we follow our hostess and are taken through to the outside....We were like, ""great, the losers seating."" NO! The patio seating is soooooo pretty. Lawn chairs, heaters, and waaaaaay quieter than the inside! The ambiance is awesome outside! Very romantic...not that I would know -_-.  Anyway....the bread basked they hook it up with at the beginning is BOMB....I love the brown bread....it has an ever so slight hint of sweetness. Appetizer: Fried Mac & Cheese....which I would never dream of ordering (I wasn't brought up on soul food)...It was amazeballs (literally, they were balls lol) 4 of them so we each got two.  Next up....we got burgers which I guess we were craving cuz we were originally going to go to Bunz (Across the street) I liked mine better...The Americana....oh so cheesy and stuff. Meat was thick and we asked for ""well-done""....It was ""well done""  It also came with mini buckets of yummy fries. Ok...so dessert....Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake! WHAT?! Yum....we had that to go and our waitress was nice enough to pack it with forks so we could try it before we left.  Ok....so the biggest awesome thing? When our busser took my plate away I told him I still wanted to eat my fries. He said ok and proceeded to just remove the plate.  A minute later, dude comes back with a new thing of fresh fries!

I feel like it NEEDS zero stars, because we didn't even get to eat there...  It was my aunt's birthday, and she called two weeks in advance seeking a reservation (we were going to have a pretty large group, around 20 people). The person who answered the phone said that they don't take reservations, but that if we came in around 5 pm on the night in question, things should be settling down enough to give us a wait of maybe an hour-- not much longer than that. A week later, my uncle (who was stressing about not being able to make a reservation) called back, and was told the EXACT SAME THING by someone else-- just come in around 5, they usually get a little quiet around that time, wait shouldn't be more than an hour.  So on my aunt's birthday, we get there at 5. The manager tells us it's going to be somewhere around THREE HOURS. My aunt, panic-stricken, looks at me and says ""What are we going to do??"" The manager (oh-so-generously) advises us that if we split our party into smaller groups, we could possibly be seated sooner. Thanks, dude. Over the course of our (admittedly short) interaction, he proved to be flippant, rude, snarky, and completely uncaring/unsympathetic. Thanks, bro, but we'll take our money elsewhere. I'm not angry that they were busy-- good for them! I'm not even angry that the manager was rude to my aunt. Well, ok, I am a little angry about that. My real frustration comes from the fact that my aunt asked him why two separate people would have told her and her husband on separate occasions that the wait would be around an hour if they came in around 5. His response? ""Oh, we tell everyone that."" No apology for misleading information, no nothing. If he had said that it was unusually busy, or ANYTHING that led me to believe they weren't DELIBERATELY misleading their potential customers, I'd feel a lot better.

The chicken salad sandwich came served on some brioche and the tender all white meat chicken was mixed with roasted almonds, mayonnaise, some scallions, and served with sliced tomatoes and lettuce.

I'm allergic to the shrimp they used here ): I broke out in hives about 30 mins after finishing my meal. Sad. No more shrimp from Cheesecake Factory for Dianna.  Overall the food was pretty good. I love their fried Mac n cheese balls. We really wanted to get a piece of cheesecake but we were so gosh darn full! I love the portions here! You always have left overs lol. The Chinese chicken salad is also a favorite!  Verdict: don't get the shrimp it's cooked very poorly. But I guess that depends on the chef & it's not quite in your control.

However, I can't let this one go. At about 4:00 p.m. my husband I decided to have dinner at the Cheesecake Factory. When we got there, they told us it would be about a fifteen minute wait which was fine by us. When we were seated (outside), we had a wonderful waitress who took our drink and food order right away. I'm sorry to say I can't remember her name but she rocked! However after about 20 minutes we were approached by another waiter who tried to get our order then asked us if we had been helped. It seemed like there was a lot of confusion going but it wasn't really a big deal. What did bother me though, is that were seated right next to a large party, a baby shower actually who were very loud, especially with their drinking games. I didn't complain to the waitress though, I just wish someone had warned us or asked us if it was okay, since they got pretty loud after a few drinks. Anyway, no big deal. I ordered the fish and chips, one of my favorite dishes. This time though, I seriously wish I had passed. Why? Because about an hour after we had left, I became very sick. My job is to know about food, how it can be contaminated, along with food borne illnesses. After about 20 minutes of vomiting and some other horrific symptoms that I won't bother to horrify yelp with, I realized I had food poisoning. I spent the rest of the night in my bathroom.

I was pleasently surprised with the size of the soup, I just wish the quality was equivalent. Canned soup. Yay.  My husband ordered the pizza and he hated it. It looked like a tombstone *frozen* pizza. Plain, greasy. We ordered 2 cocktains and they were just as much as our food but about the size of a low ball. They make sure to add lots of ice so it gets watered down and can fit in a bigger glass. 11.95 for a long island, but 8.95 for soup and salad?!  We left at 6.

709,Anna L.,"San Diego, CA",192,158,5.0,3.0,2013-12-11,"I should preface this by saying: we are not Cheesecake Factory people.  My boyfriend received $45 worth of gift cards as a stocking stuffer at his work.  Having no other plans for the evening, we headed down to Fashion Valley (despite my concerns about the mall holiday crowd.) As it turned out, the wait was less than 10 minutes, which was a first for any of my prior experiences at this location. Our server was Robin, and she had a very full section as we arrived. How busy she was did not stop her from kindly greeting us and offering drinks. My boyfriend pointed out that the table had some crumbs, which our server sent a busboy to take care of speedily, even replacing his silverware. I scanned the menu for things that looked tasty, finally landing on the Chicken Madeira.  Every ingredient is one that I favor, including perfectly crunchy asparagus, marinated mushrooms, melted mozzarella, and a rich wine and peppercorn gravy atop the chicken, with a heaping side of mashed potatoes. My bf went for the Chicken and Biscuits, which was lightly seasoned sliced chicken, beside mashed potatoes, a mixture of mushrooms, carrots, peas, and onions, topped with a splash of gravy and a fluffy biscuit.  He wasn't crazy about much, other than the biscuit, so i gave him half of my chicken.   After dinner, since we were using gift cards, we checked out the cheesecake menu.  Bf was set on the key lime cheesecake, where I was leaning more toward the pumpkin pecan, so we got both, in addition to two coffees.  Robin, actually, was really excited that I was trying the pumpkin pecan, and noted that once it ran out, there would be no more until next October.  I gotta tell ya, it was pretty terrific.  I'm not that big on desserts, but pecan pie is a weakness.  The combo of pumpkin cheesecake and pecan pie were... a seriously holy matrimony.  So delicious.  Unable to finish the gargantuan slices, we packed the remaining dessert to go, as the server dropped our check. Our server, Robin, was  so on top of everything.  We never wanted for water, a friendly (but not over-attentive) check-in, or a smile.  She seriously rocked the house, and I would absolutely love to have her as as server again (I even got the bf to leave her a bigger tip than he had originally intended- not because he wasn't happy, but that he's not in the service industry, and I'm still trying to train him how to leave a proper gratuity.)  Completely unrelated to our service (which was, again, outstanding) my boyfriend was up all night, with stomach cramps from his food.  He's not that sensitive, so something had to have been off.  I, however, was fine... so that brings it down to the Chicken and Biscuits as the culprit.  That, unfortunately, is why this is 3 stars.  I don't expect much from chain restaurants, usually, but I at least expect myself or my dining companions to return home in good health.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=680,3.24,3.47,3.252,2.604,3.378

938,W W.,"San Diego, CA",0,52,,1.0,2013-12-19,"My experiences with this establishment have always been less than stellar and the last one is the final straw.  I will attempt to be brief. I came here with my child, two of my sisters and their two children on November 9, 2013 for a late lunch.  We were seated immediately and thought that this may be a good thing.  Well, we were seated in a section with a tepid waitress who was thoroughly disinterested in us.  She appeared annoyed when I inquired about the gluten free options for myself and my child; she was unable to answer all of my questions (yeah, sorry, we have food allergies and she should know her business) and had to go inquire of the kitchen - a prospect that was obviously less than thrilling to her.  At least she got our orders in correctly. The food is good, but not spectacular.  Also, I had ordered a la cart and one of my dishes was forgotten.  Not a big deal, but the waitress never acknowledged it; rather, a random manager came by to tell me and to apologize.  Our waitress failed to check up on us or refill our waters; now, this is a pet peeve of mine as I drink about 4 to 6 litres of water per day.  It's the middle of the day.  I'm thirsty.  Please fill my glass; is it that difficult?  Apparently it was for her. I should mention that after finishing our meal, my child began to become ill.  Uh-oh. When our check came, there were some oddities.  We wanted to split the bill onto three cards so I was hard at work trying to do the math; I worked on it for 30 minutes but could not match up the totals.  I noticed that they charged us a mandatory 18% gratuity (that bent us a bit, seeing as none of us felt our server deserved that much even though we all typically tip around 20%), even though we only had a party of six!  Finally I realized that they weren't charging us 8% tax, it was more like 9.4%.  What?  Since our waitress had abandoned us, we asked another passing waiter about the tax rate; he didn't have an answer so he got a manager-who also didn't have an answer.  In fact, she said that since she was from Arizona, she didn't even know what the rate in San Diego was.  You know, I work in retail, as well as one of my sisters, and we both were dumbfounded:  how can you work in the service industry and not know the answer to our question???  At least the manager removed the difference from the total. At this point, my child was very ill.  On the way out the door I inquired after a manager I might speak to when I got home.  I obtained a name and called when I got home.  The man seemed empathetic at first and expressed a wish to have fixed it in the restaurant.  I explained that my child was becoming sicker and sicker and had to get home.  He also had no answers for me but told me to call corporate on Monday.  REALLY????  What kind of manager are you?  He became indifferent to the point of talking to others while I was on the phone with him - how rude! I did call Cheesecake corporate headquarters on Monday morning.  After speaking with a nice woman and her doing some footwork, the issue was resolved.  We were being taxed on the gratuity that we should not ever have been charged.  Wow.... really?  She refunded one of my sister's cards and issued a gift certificate for us to use.  However, I stressed to her that I live in San Diego and there are too many good places to eat for me to waste my time with their establishment ever again.  EVER. I WILL NEVER DINE HERE AGAIN.  I don't care if you're food is tasty, Cheesecake; your service is terrible and your staff is ill-informed.  Go cheat someone else, I'm done with you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=880,3.32,3.44,3.236,2.436,3.3920000000000003

I went in with 6 of my college buddies and you could tell that our waitress Ashley did not want to wait on us. But since she knew we were a party of 6 or more, she would get a 18% tip no matter what.  About 3 minutes after we ordered my buddy forget to mention that he wanted mushrooms added to his salad and mentioned it to her as she passed by and she actually have him attitude and said well I have to go tell the chef now since I already put your order in. At that time I asked for more water for the table and she came with one pitcher which only filled up half our waters. She then left and didn't bother to fill the rest of the waters so I had to ask another bus boy. Throughout the rest of the meal we all just felt a negative attitude as she clearly didn't want to wait on us. I Come to Cheesecake at least once a month and they always take care of us. We ask for separate bills and they always handle it with no issues and we always leave nice tips. When we asked her, she complained about it and said she would see what she could do. She came back with a full check and a pen and asked us to tell her how much money we want on each card which is not splitting the check for us at all.

While they do not represent culinary revolution,  it is usually consistent and good... oh but not today, this one is not good. Chicken was so sadly overlooked it was an affront to poultry and chopped salad was brownish and over dressed in a bad balsamic concoction.... How do you mess up salad? We thought they might just have a pinch hitting, bench warmer, chef filling in on an off night, but it might be more about quality control and branch management because despite needing to send back two of the four dishes they didnt comp anything and then the bathroom was so dirty it looked like a gas station. We try to be sports and not send things back but had to send two things back, yikes. The waiter and manager were decent about it but not the kind of ok you would want after having to send back most of what you ordered.  On the positive side, the Margarita and fried macaroni appetizer were the normal good you expect from this solid chain.

The bread was soft and was a grain bread, now it's a piece of white bread slathered in butter and toasted (so much butter I asked to get a piece of plain bread and switch it out) but it didn't help the sandwich, they changed the chicken (it was diced) now it's poor quality pulled meat. And big chunks that are hard to chew. It almost looked comical when it came out. I was like seriously guys? The ceaser salad on the side was poor too. Old stale croutons, and the dressing is forgettable.  I also had fried catfish the last visit....omg no. Do not get this. I could only eat the mashed potatoes.

Okay, so lets get some of the negatives out there, in case you didn't know. It's located in Fashion Valley. The parking is horrendous most of the times. Their customer service is spotty. When it's busy, there will be a long wait, period. Seriously, go eat somewhere else. The portions are huge, so you eat way too much, which means too many calories and you get fat. The place is surely not where you want to go on a budget. With that all being said, coming here for me has always been about the special occasion. Call me a huge sap, it just is what it is for me. What's great about it is that this place can seat a pretty huge party when carefully thought out. Now I'm not saying the wait will be any less and in fact they don't take reservations until 11am, I believe. Their menu is very expansive and they do a lot of it very very well! Easy to please a group of people that want it all! This last visit, my wife and I came after she got off work and I had just taken leave from transferring off the Gridley. I was very pleased that there was no wait on a weeknight and we got seated immediately. One thing I noticed was the seating outside had been upgraded. Yeah, I asked to sit outside to enjoy our San Diego winter! Once we got out there, I noticed that there seemed to not be an uncomfortable booth or chair in sight. We asked to be moved once because one of the heaters did not reach to my seat. DAMN, eating outside with the heaters on you and the very very nice comfortable seats set the mood just right on the night. I loved it! As far as our meal, I had the tried and true Chicken Madeira with all aspargus and my wife had a small caesar salad with shrimp, both of which were great! Her shrimp was grilled and was cooked perfectly. My dish was delish, as always and I believe the best dish here! We pretty much split the Chicken Madeira since my knew if she didn't get any at first, that I would eventually destroy it by myself in record time! Our service was way better than normal on this occasion, as they were all so attentive. I'd love for it to stay this consistent! Oh, of course we got a slice of cheesecake. Their blueberry cheesecake was so f'in good. We killed it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=480,3.04,3.3,3.188,3.184,3.1960000000000006

Anyways, we sat outside and it was peaceful. It was lovely too! I ended up leaving so satisfied.  The second time I came here for my birthday was in 2014.. Okay, everything was good. My boyfriend and I only waited for about five minutes. We had to sit inside which kind of suck to be honest. It was so loud and it was hard to have a conversation with my boyfriend without yelling. Okay, so we had this waiter and he was too much! He talks way too loud and it's just hard to explain. I just know when a waiter/waitress is being over the top and is too much.

I like the chicken piccata, chicken marsala, Kobe burger, jambalaya, burrito,  and many other plates. The prices are a little high, but worth it, portions are usually generous, and the quality of the food is excellent. $7-9 for cheesecake and cake is expensive but it is great! They have 2 peanut butter chocolate versions too. They have a friendly staff, good service, and there is outdoor seating. If you just go in to get a slice of cheesecake to go, they don't have a good system or queue in my opinion.

Great portion) - Shrimp scampi (Very good, next time we'll order with sauce on the side since it was saturated in it) - Chicken maderia (I think that's how it's spelled.

The reason they're not getting 5 stars from me is the wait to eat can be incredibly long. They don't take reservations so if you're going here at primetime, your wait could easily exceed 1 hour. There isn't a lot of waiting room either so plan on standing around or going shopping while you wait. This location is located in the Fashion Valley Mall in Mission Valley so there's plenty of shops nearby for your convenience.  The entire wait staff here wears all white which I kind of like. I've yet to see spots on any of the employees attire which shows you they care for a clean and tidy restaurant.  The menu is quite extensive. There's everything from pasta to seafood to burgers to Chinese food and tai dishes. They also offer a skinnylicious menu if you prefer to eat as healthy as possible when you eat out. They have a variety of options on this menu as well and that's more often than not what I order off of. Their prices are pretty cheap on the skinnylicious menu as well as you're typically getting a smaller serving of food. If you get their normal menu items, you get a ton of food. If you ever have any issues with your order the wait staff is very good at getting that taken care of and they all have been very friendly.  My tables of choice are in the bar area. If you're lucky enough to find an open table, just sit and avoid the wait. There are a few TV's in the bar which are nice if you can't go a meal without watching sports. They have a full bar so you can order a wide variety of drinks.  The bathrooms are some of the nicest I've seen in busy restaurants.

551,Erin D.,"Houston, TX",14,905,882.0,2.0,2014-05-02,"I know what you're saying - the Cheesecake Factory? Why go there? The answer: It's the only place to eat (aside from PF Chang's) close to where I was working. FYI don't follow the signs to the Cheesecake Factory if you enter off of Fashion Valley drive. It's faster and shorter to go in the opposite direction of the signs.  Parking was horrendous, which I suppose is expected at a mall. If you've only got 30 minutes for lunch, forget it. You will spend at least 20 minutes trying to find parking. There is a parking garage behind the Cheesecake Factory. If you want to park on the first floor, it's $3. However, if you're willing to go up and down some stairs, you can park for free on the second or third levels. To enter the free parking part (because the garage has two separate entrances for paid and non-paid), enter RIGHT behind the cheesecake factory. I have never seen a split parking garage before. Usually everyone in the garage pays the same price (or it's completely free). Because parking was such a pain, I called to ask about the wait time. The guy who answered said there was no wait. Upon arrival, there was a 5 minute wait. This doesn't seem long, but if you're on a timed lunch break (thankfully I was not), keep this in mind. I ordered the pizza and salad lunch special. The green salad already comes with a viniagrette, so be aware. I got the supreme pizza with everything (sans olives) on it, and it was pretty decent. I could only eat half of the salad and half of the pizza, so the lunch portion is still generous. The table next to me ordered salads, and I thought they were HUGE. Overall, the Cheesecake Factory is not my favorite place to eat. I probably should've ordered a cheesecake, but there was no time. My bill was $14.91 including tax and tip. I suppose that's not too bad for lunch, and I was able to take half of the pizza home.

The Cheesecake Factory is notorious for having some of the most calorie loaded meals. Do we outlaw these restaurants? No, we come once a year or embrace obesity. I'm still deciding myself. They have some decent appetizers. The avocado eggroll is probably my favorite. The tamarind sauce is very tasty and overall it's a unique dish. I almost always order a pasta here and if you know me at all I'm a HUGE gluten sensitive pasta freak. Their pastas have never disappointed me and I've been to multiple factories on the East and West coast and have tried almost all of them. The great thing about CF is that they are really standardized and you get the same dish wherever you go. Of course, no meal is complete at the CF without some cheesecake. Sometimes I am tempted to get the big ol' fancy ones with like 8 ingredients: chocolate, caramel, nuts, cream, raspberries, turtles etc, but I've learned the best ones are always the really simple ones. The original topped with strawberries, the Godiva and the berry ones.  Come hungry, leave heavier.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=380,3.44,3.33,3.284,3.024,3.374

We sat there waiting to be seated, watching them seat 4 other couples that walked in after us. We had to say something to them after the 5th person and it seems as if they just forgot about us completely, letting us stand there, 5 feet away from them, for 20 minutes.  They say us at a table that still had the check from the previous customers laying there. When we tried to get someones attention to come and get it, they just told us to wait for the waiter. After the waiter finally came, we ordered some drinks and an appetizer. She brought us out some water (no straws) and took our order. Since we didn't get any straws, I spent the next 15 minutes trying to get a waiters attention so that they could give us some straws. A guy said he would and never showed back up with them. Finally our appetizer comes out, 30 minutes after ordering it and we ask that guy for some straws and after about another 5 minutes he finally brings them out. We finish out appetizer and wait another 15 minutes for someone to come take our real order.  I'm honestly tired of reliving the experience in this review. We finally got our food at around 11:15 PM, an hour and 45 minutes after we arrived, the steak wasn't medium rare and it looked like it was just thawed out and thrown on the grill. The broccoli looked like it was run under hot water, put on a plate, and thrown in the microwave to make it hot. We finally left at around 11:25.

Nope it was only about a 45 minute of a wait. When I signed us in I made sure to tell them that we were celebrating my sisters birthday.  Once seated we ordered drinks and appetizers. We ordered the wings and fried mac n cheese balls with marinara. My husband said the wings were spicy hot and very vinegary. The mac n cheese balls were very good, these are a definite must to try when you come here.  We then ordered 4 entrees, Orange Chicken, Chicken n Biscuits, Steak Diane. The servings were huge. The Chicken n Biscuits were not that great, it was served with a side of seasonal vegetables they were the highlight of my meal. The chicken was dry I ordered an extra side of gray just to add moisture to it. We then ordered 4 pieces of cheesecake all of which were delicious.  Now here is why I gave the 1 star.

My sister was here visiting for work so I made the 60 mile drive to where she was working to take her to a nice dinner for her birthday.

I've tried the majority of their cheesecakes and quite a few entrees on their menu and they're all delicious. The reason why I only gave 4 stars is due to the lack of consistency with their food and service. This location always seems to be busy but at times it's busy beyond belief. On those days, the quality of the food and service is definitely effected. There's been a couple of times where I've received my food and the order was wrong and/or the food was cold, and I mean it wasn't even warm. I guess it's ok since they make up for it with the amazing cheesecake that I MUST get after every meal. For entrees I suggest getting the Chicken Madeira or the Smokehouse BBQ Cheeseburger; amazing.

The service is usually decent here with the servers being semi attentive, varying heavily on your server. I feel it would benefit to have a more attentive wait staff as a whole though as the wait staff of a restaurant can make or break your experience, as it has far too often here.   The food is almost always very good though to make up for the mediocre wait staff thankfully. Very little of the food doesn't taste good and the quality of the food is very consistent, showing a well trained kitchen. If I was able to tip directly to the kitchen I would every visit.

Nor the fact that he kept putting his head near my lap then when he flipped over he kicks me on my leg with his feet as he laid down again but in the opposite position!

I took a sip and thought it was overly sweet.  A couple minutes later, the owner delivered our food. My friend said her looked great. I thought mine looked a little too white of a flatbread. I took a bite, no flavor, we asked for pepper and cheese, mine...still no flavor. Really bland. My friend took a bite and she thought she tasted bleach...So the waitress came by again and asked about our food. We mentioned it. She asked if I wanted something else, but I was too tired and hungry to look at the menu again. I already knew what I wanted for my cheesecake, so I ordered that instead.

1102,Leah R.,"San Diego, CA",0,23,,1.0,2014-10-07,"*This review is for to-go/curbside ONLY-their dine-in is fine. Two terrible experiences with this particular cheesecake factory and their to-go team: 1st: So I used to work in the mall, and everyone knows how precious each minute is for lunch time when you are hourly. As a fellow service member, I have so much sympathy for food service and understand how tough it must be to please people when they are hungry. So i come in ordering two slices of cheesecake for myself and a coworker and it was pretty empty on a weekday. I was the only one in line for to-go, and everyone else was waiting to sit in the restaurant. I order my cheesecakes with Guy #1, and Guy #2 starts prepping for them. Guy #1 then turns his back to me (which is fine) and starts gabbing about his date to his other coworkers while Guy #2 makes my cheesecakes. He finishes in about 3 minutes and sticks them on the counter. Guy#1 is still turned around and does not see these cheesecakes are done. I'm still standing there waiting for him to realize they are done. I could have reached for them, but seeing as I'm only 5 feet and their cheesecake display counters are high I couldn't reach. I finally got them after another 5 minutes of Guy #1 chatting about his potential Friday night plans. 2nd: I called in my order on a Tuesday night at 6:52 (saw the receipt) and knew I would be there in around 10-15 minutes for curbside. Once again, I ordered 2 cheesecakes and some bread thinking these things were already made and just needed to be in place in to-go boxes and bagged up. I arrived at 7:04 and called them informing Erica I had arrived and was waiting outside. In between calling and FINALLY getting my food, two cars already got their order which were hefty family orders of appetizers, entrees, and cheesecakes. I kept thinking what the heck? I just ordered 2 cheesecakes? Finally, this girl comes out at 7:23, but she had to ask me for my name as she brought out the wrong order. She took my $20 and said she'll be back with the change and the correct order. It took her another 10 minutes to do all that. I finally got my food at 7:30. The whole process took 40 minutes for 2 cheesecakes (and they forgot the bread). She also didn't even give me the correct change, just breaking my $20 asking me ""what would you like back?"" In my head, I'm thinking...""all my change!!!"" But, I had to settle for 3 dollars back since this girl didn't understand the concept of breaking my $20 with change and everything. (I didn't want to tip her at all, but i settled for $0.36 when I was planning on just giving the whole $20 if they had given me my stuff on time).  Anyways, don't do to-go or curbside if you want a LOOOOOONG experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=1100,3.08,3.33,3.268,2.5960000000000005,3.23

I came here a few nights ago with some friends, and was disappointed by the size of my cheesecake. The Oreo cheesecake is always delicious, but could have used a little more for what I paid. (Almost $8 for one slice) As an appetizer before hand, a friend and I split the avocado egg rolls. 6 came on a plate so we each ate three which seemed like a perfect portion since we decided to skip a main course. The dipping sauce is good and the egg rolls were fresh and hot. Again, a little overpriced for how many came out of you have a larger group with you, but tasty none the less. We sat outside on a nicely furnished outdoor seating patio with really nice heating lamps by each table. The atmosphere of the whole outdoor area had an unusually upscale feel to it.

It is topped off with a medley of peas, onions, red and yellow peppers, crisp asparagus, and juicy pieces of honey glazed chicken.

627,Kat M.,"Point Loma, San Diego, CA",20,12,,1.0,2014-11-05,"I have worked in restaurants for a long time. I've seen a lot, heard a lot, and I personally dine a lot.  Disclaimer: Consider yourself warned of The Cheesecake Factory Fashion Valley, the Chicken Madeira, and weird C grade service. You just never know what kind of problem solving abilities you will encounter. Here is my experience:  1. I approached the host stand. She did not make eye contact or greet me for over a minute. Prior to doing so she spoke with a co-worker who interrupted her consistent gaze at the computer screen. After her coworker spoke to her, she said hello to me. I smiled, ""Hello, two please."" She was polite. Just amazing that this generation does not prioritize greetings; we love looking into computer screens! Whatever no foul, just weird. 2. Sat down, greeted three minutes later, ordered 2 waters, a glass of wine, & a side salad. I asked for a glass of Pinot Noir, he recommended a wine. I look up the wine, I asked him the name he said, he repeated it, I couldn't find the name he said. I asked if it was there; he said ""I don't know it just came to mind."" Okkkk, ummmm? I order a glass that was actually on the menu. Weird.  3. 1 water served. I reminded him I wanted 2. He said he would bring it out when the other person in my party arrived, he said he didn't want the ice to melt. Ok- weird.  4. Waiter returns, I order, Chicken Madeira. It is my favorite & one of their most popular items. My boyfriend asked, ""Can I order from here?"" as he held up the small bites menu. Waiter's response, ""If you want,"" in a condescending tone. Odd? I can't assume to know his intentions. Food came quickly. Several bites in the waiter checks on us. 5. Next bite, the chicken is undercooked. Blood is present. I use the flashlight on my phone to verify. Yes in fact it was bloody, pink, chewy chicken! Undercooked.  I rationalize why the chicken could be undercooked; my hypothesis: The chicken is pounded to a thin piece for preparing; I'm sure it is a fine balance to not over cook the chicken, and in doing so it was undercooked. Understandable.  6. Waiter checks on us. I show him the bloody chicken, he takes it away. He's quick & hesitant to look at the meat in front of me, & a bit dismissive, probably trying to correct/minimize the complaint. He informed me a manager would come over.  7. Manager, ""Oh no, I'm so sorry, I'll fix that right away."" Im fine with that, yet surprised. Undercooked chicken is NOT GOOD. 8. Manager brings a new Chicken Maderia within 4 minutes. I thought, wow/fast. He disclosed that he pulled one off the line so I wouldn't have to wait. My thought: someone's food is now jammed up. I appreciated the prompt response.  9. I examine the plate, it was my first plate, re-plated; sloppy on the edges and re-dressed. They just put a new piece of chicken on it & I could see where I took a fork full of potatoes off of it from round 1. I'm hopeful the chicken was new & cooked. Cross contamination is now an issue. 10. I ate a couple bites, seems fine. Waiter checks on us. I'm good. I say thank you. Error sorta fixed, no big deal. 11. Few more bites. UNDERCOOKED again. My boyfriend also has a bite. Pink, chewy meat.  I cut open the meat, use the flashlight to verify; pink rubbery meat! Ok this is a foul! I have a food handlers card & I know everyone in that building has one too! That fine balance chicken preparation technique should have been corrected. 12. I cut into the other piece of chicken, it's already cut, the kitchen or manager checked to ensure it was not undercooked. My educated guess: It's probably a piece of chicken from my first plate. Maybe they thought, ""why waste the other piece of chicken?"" We'll cross cross contamination would be a really good reason to dump that first plate! Lazy, risky. NOT GOOD.  13. A new manager approaches, ""What happened?"" he asked. ""What are we doing for you?"" he asked. Did he really just ask me to solve his problem?! I respond, ""I don't know what happened, but I know that was not a new plate, & bottom line the chicken was bloody, & undercooked on 2 attempts. I don't trust that you even brought a new plate."" I should have asked him what he was going to do. I'm not hungry now, having consumed a portion of undercooked chicken that I will be glad to never eat again. Visions of food poisoning symptoms flashed through my mind. He informs me he is going to find out what happened. I never find out. He does not return. 14. Waiter offers a complimentary dessert. The cheesecake won't be bloody, right? Check is dropped, meal is comped, but my boyfriend's is not, $14.00 is the total. The waiter gets a 15% tip. He didn't make the food, but C grade service was provided. Conclusion: RAW/UNDERCOOKED CHICKEN x2. My experience was unacceptable & weird! Thanks for not requiring payment for the undercooked chicken meals. A comped side salad, a glass of wine, and slice of cheesecake sure helped with today's malaise! NOT.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=560,3.2,3.31,3.288,2.8200000000000003,3.266

My wife brought me here for my birthday and for being a veteran, i have to say, i ordered 1 mojito, cant say it was at all good, i figured maybe it was just watered down, so i ordered another, before I know it, i had 4 mojitos i didnt feel anything of a buzz. When I asked the waitress, nothing seemed to make sense. My only suggestions, food presentation was a bit sloppy, and lastly, if your going to charge $12-$15 for a mojito, its only FAIR the drink show for it. ""CONSISTENCY"" Maybe a bit of bar tending training is needed. The mojito was basically lemonade with mint and full of ICE.

They have a huge menu with a good variety of different dishes. Anybody can find something that will satisfy their palates. I've been here so many times and it's always difficult to decide! Of course, the free bread and butter allows you to peruse the menu for a while even if you're starving. Hahaha! My favorites here are the lettuce wraps, tuna tataki salad, their pastas and their steaks. This place is, of course, known for its huge portions and it's always a good idea to ask for a to-go box so you have room for one of their rich and delectable cheesecakes. Speaking of cheesecakes, they have a lot of varieties from the original to fruity to creamy and chocolaty. I usually get something with chocolate, but the banana cream and blueberry are also delicious. They also have other non-cheesecake desserts but I've never really tried them. The Cheesecake Factory is a popular place so be sure to plan ahead especially if you're eating during peak times.

We didn't say anything we just pushed it aside and used another one. We had to ask twice before getting lemons for our water. When I got my steak it was burnt and over cooked. The worst part was the waitress continued to argue the steak was not over cooked nor burned. She refused to take my plate back by making all sorts of excuses. I don't think it's a waitress' position to make that decision. She should've taken it back or had a manager come out and look at it. Her attitude was very unprofessional! After she left, she came back and said if I wanted they would remake the steak but this time cut it in half and then cook it. I didn't like the idea and at that point I no longer felt comfortable sending back my plate with her. It seemed like if she was taking my plate back it was coming with a little something on it.

Best I have had in a while the whole family loved it.  As far as the food.. Well it looked good... The BAD: There was an awful smell like they used old mop water to clean the floors, this was very unappealing right when your stepping in. The mugs they used need to be thrown away and buy new ones, also my wife's mug was dirty. The pasta had NO FLAVOR, is was bland, and all you could taste was oil. I was extremely upset about that.

Until today, i hadnt been to a Cheesecake Factory since high school, which was nearly 5 years ago! The days when we'd bop around the mall for hours and eat here with our obnoxious yellow Forever 21 shopping bags and order virgin daquiris. Embarrassing! Anyways, after December Nights we were in the romantic holiday mood and had some time to kill before our 10:45 movie so we decided to come here. The only reason i didnt give 1 star is because our server, Marshall was so polite and on top of his stuff. He checked up on us frequently and cracked some jokes and made the experience a lot better. We ordered the fettucine with chicken and sun dried tomatoes and the shrimp scampi and steak diane combo. I also had a pineapple moscow mule. The food was really below average. I probably would have been happier with my food at a Dennys or something.  The fettucine was pretty okay but it was way to saucy and the sun dried tomatoes were just plopped right on top of the pasta. The combo meal was a whole 'nother diasaster. Everything was strangely spicy and salty yet extremely bland at the same time. The shrimp was so peppery and the batter on the shrimp tasted like pure flour. The sauce was sooo incredibly bland yet i could not stop drinking water which means there had to have been so much salt in them! I asked for the steak diane to be cooked medium but they came back soo overcooked and past well done and the sauce on them was dreadful. Lastly, the combo came with mashed potatoes but they were hardened and cold by the time they got to me. The pineapple moscow mule was alright but there was no ginger or lime flavor. It just tasted like pineapple and vodka. Pretty dissapointing for $10.  Honestly, after tonight i definitely remember why i have not come here in over 5 years. It is extremely overpriced and the food is just not good! The service was great, but if im going to pay over $50 for dinner, i'd rather go somewhere with food that is more palatable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=540,3.12,3.27,3.336,3.2720000000000002,3.21

374,Kelli S.,"Honolulu, HI",1902,1170,9782.0,4.0,2014-12-23,"This past year, The Cheesecake Factory (TCF) celebrated ""National Cheesecake Day"" on two days (July 30-31) instead of just on the last day of July. When I was in Hawaii, I always had wanted to go to the one Cheesecake Factory on the island for this celebration--in which you get 50% off a cheesecake for dine-in only--but I knew the Waikiki location would be absolutely chaotic (more chaotic than it actually is). But, I figured it was worth a shot going to the Fashion Valley Cheesecake Factory in San Diego to experience my first ""National Cheesecake Day"" ... and I just had my fingers crossed that it would not be too frenzied.   Much to my surprise, my dining experience at this Cheesecake Factory was better than I thought it would be. I met a friend around 7 p.m. for dinner; I came a little early to put our name in, and I was actually seated within 10 minutes. There were larger parties waiting to be seated, but the crowds were not as large (or crazy) as I imagined they would be.   I perused the menu while I waited for my friend, but I already have a few tried-and-true Cheesecake Factory favorites (including cheesecakes). Our server was attentive and friendly, and she brought us everything we needed without us really asking (extra water, napkins, etc.). I had a great first-time visit to this location and would definitely come here again. And, my friend and I were both happy to experience our first-ever ""National Cheesecake Day"" celebration with our discounted cheesecakes. Here's what I would recommend if you're dining here: ""Macaroni and Cheese Burger"": This burger definitely falls under the ""gourmet"" category. It's unique because it includes a slightly flattened deep-fried mac and cheese ball (like the ones featured in the appetizer mentioned above) atop a charbroiled patty, Cheddar cheese sauce, lettuce, tomato, pickles, an onion and mayo. I would recommend only eating half of this savory burger if you plan to save room for dessert. ""Chicken Madeira"": This chicken dish is famous as the eatery's ""most popular chicken dish."" Flavorful and savory, this one is definitely a winner. The dish contains a couple pieces of tender, sautéed chicken breast topped generously with melted Mozzarella cheese and pieces of asparagus. It's also covered with flavorful mushroom Madeira sauce and is served with fluffy mashed potatoes. Again, if you're a cheese lover, you'll want to indulge in this savory dish. ""Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple"": Be forewarned -- this is probably one of the sweetest cheesecakes on the menu, but it's definitely one of my favorites. This decadent dessert features the original cheesecake in an Oreo Cookie crust and includes caramel, chunks of Butterfingers and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, and peanut butter throughout. Peanut butter lovers will especially appreciate the fresh dollop of peanut butter mousse that comes atop the cheesecake.  ""Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake"": Even though this sounds overwhelmingly sweet, ironically, this cheesecake isn't as sweet as its close cousin, the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple, because it contains layers of moist chocolate fudge cake in between the layers of cheesecake (versus layers of pure cheesecake). The layers of moist chocolate cake offset and complement the layers of cheesecake in a nice way, and peanut butter lovers will rejoice upon eating the dollop of peanut butter mousse atop the dessert. There are generous chunks of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups (my favorite candy) loaded in the cheesecake layers, and there are also thin layers of caramel. Finally, the crust is an absolute wonder, as it's covered with Reese's Peanut Butter Cups as well.  ""Loaded Baked Potato Tots"": I think this is one of the newer additions to TCF's menu--I have never noticed tots on the menu before--but it sounds like a yummy shareable app. It features crispy potato tots filled with cheese, bacon and green onions, and it comes served with sour cream. Think of your traditional loaded baked potato skins ... but in tots form! I love tater tots more than fries, so I definitely want to try this snack-like dish one day. ""Bruleed French Toast"": I think this is what I ordered for breakfast on the first and only time I went to TCF for brunch on a Sunday. I did really enjoy my meal because I love thick-sliced pieces of toast -- alone, on a sandwich, anything. This entrée features thick slices of rustic French bread that's baked and grilled to a golden brown and topped with powdered sugar. Yum! I remember savoring each bite of toast, which sported a soft, chewy interior and had that crunchy exterior that tasted even better with the added sweetness from the powdered sugar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=320,3.36,3.24,3.324,3.504,3.2880000000000007

My husband ordered the Steak Diane and herb crusted salmon. I ordered my usual; Jambalaya pasta all shrimp. I loved my husbands meal bc you get salmon and steak for a good price! It was also delicious. The salmon had a zesty sauce/ flavor to it. The steak came with mushrooms in a yummy sauce.  Service was excellent and never fails here.

When we arrived the host told us the wait was only 15 minutes. I figured they forgot about us since 15 minutes later my buzzer did not buzz. I gave them a little window and finally asked about our wait time. Turns out the host entered our pager number wrong. She didn't apologize for her mistake but she did seat us next. I thought okay whatever.. I'll let that go. Then our waitress came along and made everything worse! She had no smile, didn't ask us if we were celebrating anything..

669,Hannah S.,"Long Beach, CA",117,9,1.0,1.0,2015-02-10,"I'm going to preface this review by saying that I love The Cheesecake Factory and I would not be giving this specific restaurant one star if I didn't think it truly deserved it.  I went to San Diego for a fun birthday weekend, and on 2/7/2015, me and three friends went to The Cheesecake Factory to celebrate. I wasn't thinking about the fact that it was 7pm on a Saturday night and that there would probably be a wait. When we went up to the counter, we were told the wait would be 1 hour and 15 minutes. We were all starving, but decided to wait it out (because we all love this restaurant). We were sat on the outside patio, which was fine by us. We were sat around 8pm, so the wait ended up being a little less than we had expected, but by the time our server actually showed up at our table, we might as well have waited outside.  Around 8:10, our server (I don't know his name because he didn't introduce himself), came to take our drink order. The Cheesecake Factory is known for their amazing bread, so I was excited to receive some with our drinks. Another 5 minutes went by and we did receive our drinks, but no bread. Then, the waiter told us he would ""be right back,"" but never returned. We ended up asking another server if we could have some bread, and he did not make any eye-contact with our table, said ""ya,"" and kept walking. Yes, the restaurant was busy, but that shouldn't take away from its customer service. A couple minutes later, our server came by and told us that they had ""changed their policy,"" and that the customers now need to ask for bread, and that's why he didn't bring any. I don't know if this is true or not, but I have been to a lot of Cheesecake Factory's, and none have expressed this ""policy."" Oh and by the way, he still didn't bring any bread at this point.  This is when everything went REALLY downhill.   Another few minutes went by, we finally got our bread, and our server took down our orders. At this point, it was precisely 8:24pm. I know this because we started to time how long everything was taking. Around 8:29, our server came back and told us that he didn't write ""legibly,"" and that he couldn't read what our orders were (WHAT?!). We proceeded to re-tell him our orders, and then asked for another basket of bread. He was a bit more on top of things at this point, and told us that the wheat bread was in the oven, and it wouldn't be out for another 10 minutes.  At about 8:45, the manager on duty came onto the patio and walked up to the table directly next to us to apologize for the wait. This party was seated about 20 minutes after we were, yet we were completely ignored. The manager brushed by us like we weren't even there. A couple minutes later, that table, that had come AFTER us, got their food (and a basket of the bread that was supposedly ""in the oven""). By that point, I was truly angry, but the story continues.  After 40 minutes of waiting, our food finally arrived. One of my friends got his food about 5 minutes before we did, but the rest of us received ours at the same time. We were all angry at this point, but we were so hungry that we all dug in. My boyfriend's burger was cold, like it had been sitting in a refrigerator for the past half hour. I was so angry that I didn't even want to eat my food anymore, and I went to talk to a manager about this terrible experience. Now, this was the same manager that had ignored us earlier, but I put that aside and explained the situation. I showed her to our table, and she asked the rest of the party what had happened, even though I had just told her everything. It was almost like she needed another witness to believe what had actually happened. She wasn't kind, but she apologized which I appreciated. However, she only offered to comp MY meal and gave us 3 free desserts. I was grateful for this, but my boyfriends burger was cold, which she knew, and she still didn't offer to have his meal comped. She only offered to re-make it. I don't know what was going through this woman's mind, but I think we deserved to have all our meals comped. After we saw our server and the manager deliberating right in front of us, our server came back with dessert menus, and never apologized.  We finally got our cheesecakes and left The Cheesecake Factory after 10PM. We got everything to-go, because we had no interest in eating our desserts there, and I especially did not want to ""celebrate"" by birthday there any longer. I know we were treated the way we were because we were a group of young adults. We clearly weren't respected in any way, yet we gave no reason to be disrespected. This is the worst experience I've ever had at one of these restaurants, and I will never be returning to this specific location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=620,3.8,3.35,3.36,3.0760000000000005,3.5300000000000002

Delicious. The fries were dull though but nothing salt and ketchup can't fix. Their ranch seemed to be too much? I'm not sure how to explain it but it was odd. The fried calamari was sooo good. Last time I tried grief calamari at a sushi place, I almost puked from how slimy it was but this one was perfect! It's so hard picking out a slice of cheesecake because all look so good! The Oreo is hard to finish completely because of the chocolate edge but it was delicious. Even though the server was really busy, she always dropped by to see how our meal was and made sure our drink cups were full! I love this place.

I've tried many of their appetizers, a couple of their entrees, their drinks, and of course their cheesecake. The food and service has always been good ever since my first visit. Even thought it's always busy, the service hasn't been too laggy where you gotta ask twice. If you're looking for good foods to try I recommend their calamari, avocado egg rolls, chicken bellagio, steak diane, or their grilled chicken avocado club.

545,Joshua A.,"San Diego, CA",295,46,96.0,5.0,2015-03-11,"I can't find one reason why I wouldn't rate this restaurant 5 stars. Rosani, our waitress for the past two times eating here, is absolutely amazing.  I suggest that you ask for her to be your waitress because of the following: -reliable recommendations based on cravings, popularity, & protein of choice. -genuine and friendly service from beginning to end. -constantly checks up on you and refills your water -makes your experience at Cheesecake personable and enjoyable. 5 star service!! I don't think I would want any other waiter. The food was equally amazing! For an appetizer, we ordered the Ahi Carpaccio. It is raw tuna topped with house dressing with avocado and cucumbers on the side. It also comes with a sweet and tangy sauce you can pour over it to add more flavor. For our entrees, we ordered the Chicken Madeira and the Breaded Parmesan Chicken. The chicken Madeira was served with mashed potatoes and was topped with melted cheese and mushrooms and a sauce closely tasting like Marsala. The two chicken breasts were cooked perfectly and I usually don't like mushrooms but they were a perfect match. The breaded chicken tasted similar but was crispy! This was served with mash potatoes and salted asparagus. Had I known they would taste similar I would've ordered something different for a change of taste.  During previous visits here we've had the spicy chipotle BBQ pasta and the seafood gumbo. BOTH WERE DELICIOUS and paired perfectly together to share!

The upside is that the extensive patio has lots of heaters and is a lot more comfortable to sit in the waiting by the bar for a table to open up. My favorite foods to eat here are the stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer and I like the bowtie pasta with roasted garlic and chicken, and the chicken Madeira is very good as well. The pizzas are awesome as well and good for the picky eaters in your group. To finish, white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake is my jam. Service here has always been great. Love to order a Makers Old Fashioned at the bar. Some thinks I've tried I haven't like such as the thai cashew chicken which is marked as Spicy on the menu but is very mild. I didn't find this entree appetizing.

My boyfriend and friends loves the hibachi steak The reason why I'm giving it 4 out 5 because is I went to Cheesecake Factory last night with a friend and I got my usual baja chicken tacos and it did not taste the same at all.

Our buffalo blasters appetizers were delicious.  We were done with them, and about 25 minutes later, my Jambalaya comes out solo... They said my husband's Shepherds Pie would be right out.  Manager stopped by to offer a soup or salad so that he could eat with me while he waited, but we just had a large app and he didn't want to spoil his appetite for his dinner entree. Another 15 minutes of eating my Jambalaya alone, still no Shepherds Pie.  A few minutes later, it finally comes.  It was OK to say the least, but by that time, we were so done waiting around, we had a couple bites and asked for the food Togo.  Server never came back around to ask how our food was and wasn't really apologetic for how long the food took.  Being in the industry, we were really nice and understanding to the fact that shit happens. Ordered some Cheesecake Togo and that took another 15 minutes... As servers ourselves... We were pretty shocked that the server/management didn't really took into account the all waiting time we were doing...

Then I notice a couple that came in to be checked in goes up and gets a table. Of course you gotta think maybe they checked in and left and just returned but nope... Turns out they took spot next in line. I didn't know that until I walked up there and asked where we were in line because we've been waiting for awhile and they said we were already seated and pointed where the couple that came in and stole our spot. So I told them I did noticed that they just came in and got seated before us and the hostess apologized and said that happens all the time! Not a good excuse..but anyways what's done was done they got us a seat. Food was great except for my main course which was the California omelette with burnt fries! It really looked as if someone was too lazy to make fresh batch of fries since breakfast time was coming to an end so they just scooped the rejected burnt fries.. And I did post the picture! They apologized and ended up never bringing out new fries because I was about done with my meal when my waitress checked up and was surprised they still hadn't brought out the fries.

Again I hate big establishments, horrible customer service, price not worth the frozen food or mediocre food, not worth the wait, and definitely not worth your time. I guess it's good if you are a family and just need those big establishments like Cheesecake, Buca De Beppo, Applebees etc.  I did however enjoy my miso glazed slamon, it was pretty decent...but I was also coming out from a work out so I was just hungry. I think cheesecake can be good, if they had good customer service. For a big establishment I don't think that's the least of their concern. Anyhoo, our server was horrible, she was non existent most of the time and after 30 minutes of waiting for our bill we were talking about how we should have gone somewhere else... What a waste of her time and our time.  To all the haters- this is an opinion. If I have a bad experience here don't hate because the servers here didn't do their jobs.

How do I figure out the best way to relate my experiences at The Cheesecake Factory to Yelp? like this... Eating at Cheesecake Factory is like having a one night stand with someone you come to regret the next day.  Like awkward one night stands, TCF always feels so good during the heat of the moment. Most of the entrees are so drool-worthy and delectable. There is nothing more satisfying than eating a delicious meal and ending the adventure with one of those signature cheesecake slices.  But unfortunately, you also come to regret eating at Cheesecake Factory every time because you feel like shit afterwards. Most of their entrees and desserts are high in calories, carbs and fat  ( I am talking to you Chicken Alfredo pasta!!!). Every time I eat here, I regret it because I feel like I am shortening my lifespan by 15 hours.  That being said, I can't resist the temptations of The Cheesecake Factory like I can't resist regrettable one night stands with women. The food is comforting, the service is always consistently good for me, and that complimentary bread is addicting like crack! disclaimer: I don't support one night stands...lol",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=180,3.84,3.49,3.38,3.216,3.6300000000000003
731,Jennifer V.,"San Diego, CA",126,152,152.0,4.0,2015-03-30,"I've always been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory, except when the wait is so long, you have to choose another restaurant to eat at. Most of the time, my family and I just wait for a table in the bar because it tends to be quicker than waiting for a table in the dining areas. Besides that, the service is always pretty consistent and the food never seems to take too long to come out. Luckily, they offer delicious bread to snack on while you wait for what you ordered. Some of my favorite items are the Skinnylicious Veggie Burger, Grilled Turkey Burger, Chinese Chicken Salad, and most recently, the Brioche Breakfast Sandwich. Honestly, I'm not a big cheesecake person, but the Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake is a great choice. I recommend splitting it with someone due to how rich it is though! It's nice that there are so many different options but, it's always a challenge deciding on what to order! Their Skinnylicious menu is the best because it allows me to indulge a little without overeating. They also have a tasty breakfast menu that I never tired in all the years I've come here until lately. For Sunday Brunch, the Eggs Benedict is my go to. On the daily breakfast menu, I really enjoyed the Brioche Breakfast Sandwich (scrambled egg, smoked bacon, ham, grilled tomato, melted cheddar cheese and mayonnaise on grilled brioche bread) that I tried for the first time about a week ago. The potatoes were actually really good too because they were mixed with sautéed onions. The meal was so filling, I had to take half of it home.

We took out of town visitors there on Friday evening and the service was absolutely horrible. First we waited a long time for service, which is understandable on a busy Friday Easter weekend night, but then when we did get service it went from bad to worse.  We were seated outside, so it was evidently a long walk from the kitchen so getting all 7 of us our meals took a while. Then the water dropped the container of catsup which splashed on one of our visitor's very expensive swede shoes as well as on 2 other's shirts. Of course he apologized and gave our guest a wet paper towel to clean off his shoe. A wet paper towel and an I'm sorry. It didn't get any better after that. The same guest asked for mustard for his burger and waiting almost 10 minutes for it!  If this were in almost any other place I have been, a manager would have come to the table to offer his/her apology and done something to compensate for the accident. But here, nothing. My guest did even say something to that effect to the waiter, but the waiter just responded with "" I did apologize and it was an accident."" I was even more embarrassed by that. During dinner, there were at least 2 more spills of things - one was a tray of candles crashing to ground, and I don't even know what the other was. The staff moved things around to clean up the glass and then left one of the portable heaters so close to my chair that I all but fell when I got up to leave. There was no concern for or even awareness of the comfort and safety of their patrons. Needless to say I left a terrible, insulting, tip (and I am normally a very generous tipper), but I'm sure the waiter didn't think he did anything to deserve the insult and likely only thinks I am cheap.

I was hoping to cheer up a friend who just had a family emergency and was disappointed by the complete lack of regard this place has for their patrons. For starters I called ahead to order curbside so I could save time. I was placed on hold and proceeded to wait...and wait...and wait. I waited so long I was actually able to drive all the way to the restaurant before anyone ever picked up. On arrival, and as I was still on hold I saw and heard a manager, FINALLY pick up. I could hear him but he could not could hear me well as the check in area is loud with background noise and music. I tap him on the should and show him my phone saying, ""you don't have to take my curbside order now as I've been on hold for close to 20 MINUTES and was able to drive here!!!"" Does he apologize and proceed to help me? Absolutely not. He says, oh sorry they can help you 'over there' as he points me to a register near the cheesecakes which has a line of 9 people in it. I'm beyond annoyed at this point but am already here and want to make my friend happy as she likes their calamari. So I wait an ADDITIONAL 20 minutes in the line to order and ask at that time for the location general managers name. I was was told by the polite cashier that she would bring it to me. Surprise - she didn't. The variety and quality of food is good but the lack of organization and level of service unfortunately overrides any positive experience one could have here. Mistakes will happen but when they do, it's how you handle them that counts. While having this awful dining experience I had plenty of time to write this review. It's what happens when you DON'T care enough to properly take care of your customers. Goodbye Cheesecake Factory, you just lost a long time patron.

The building itself is pleasant to look at and the fact that it's right next to one of the fancier malls in San Diego helps. However, parking can be a little arduous on weekends and holidays. Service runs smoothly - but it can get pretty busy, so don't be surprised if you need to wait a little bit for your food to arrive. The menu is quite large and caters to many different tastes, whether you want pizza, seafood, pasta, or even steak. The dessert/chesecake menu is just as varied as the main options, which is always a good thing. However, quality does come with a price; be prepared to spend a little bit of money if you go the appetizer, main course, dessert route.

Service has also been great for me. My servers have always been courteous and friendly. I know that when I come here, I am going to be well taken care of.  Of course, you may note that I only gave a four star rating. My sole objections stem from the somewhat high prices and the loud dining room. I have a very difficult time holding a conversation during dinner as most of the time I feel like I have to yell across the table.

I had a bad experience here once with a worm in my lettuce wraps, so I pretty much stick with the pasta and a piece of strawberry cheesecake if I need that extra splurge. Normally I would give this place 3 stars, but after my experience on Sunday, I needed to comment on how awesome our waitress was. Since Cam's mom was in town, we all wanted to go out for a nice dinner with her. We were also with Cam's sister and her two babies, so we packed them all up in the car and decided to go out for dinner (warning: bad decision). By the time we're seated, it's an hour to bedtime for the one year old, so he's a fussy mess. Banging spoons on the table, crying, acting out, etc. I'm super embarrassed, but our waitress (our heroine) was extremely patient and tried to help by bringing out bananas, juice, a high chair, and anything else that was asked of her. I thought that Cheesecake Factory had kids menus with crayons, but my memory must be failing me.

I had the Cajun jambalaya chicken and shrimp pasta and holy poop! This was sooooo good. The shrimp was so fresh and the chicken literally melted in my mouth it was so moist and delicious! I don't usually like chicken in my pasta but this was out of this world! My boyfriend had a bacon bacon burger, which he teared up (haha) because it was the best burger he ever had. He said there was plenty of bacon and it was cooked beautifully, he also said the cheese was melted just right and the meat had a little pink which was juicy. The cheesecakes is so delicious!!!

The manager then came out and said all the artichokes were hard. So no appetizer for us. My husbands lunch was the Carolina pulled pork which he said was good. My garlic noodles were horrible. First off I ordered the dinner portion not lunch and the serving I got barely covered the bottom of the plate. Second there was no garlic in it. There was hardly any taste at all.

I don't want to keep on tasting their uncooked rice as I am pregnant and I do not approve of my baby to continue to consume uncooked rice, but that's basically it.

Their cheesecake is the best off course with all different flavors. Last time I ordered the MANGO KEY LIME CHEESECAKE and it was delicious.

275,Kathy T.,"San Diego, CA",420,348,2384.0,3.0,2015-07-13,"UPDATE: 7/17/15 - I received a letter in the mail from ""Ashley"", and a gift card, which gave me a gift certificate for LESS THAN the amount I paid on my 7/8 visit. Plus, this manager took almost 10 days to address my issue by sending the gift card. Pro Tip: Dine in ONLY. Don't get food to-go (except cheesecake). Original Review: I hope the GM sees (and cares enough about his store) to read through this downgraded review. I don't know what was wrong with the Cheesecake Factory on the evening of 7/8/15, but the kitchen cook & to-go people were waaaaay off point. I thought previous curbside-take-out problems were a thing of the past. I was mistaken. FYI, we learned there's a new GM, Rod. When I was last here 23 days ago, the GM was Gil, who is probably somewhere where he's appreciated. 23 days later..... What I ate: Turkey sandwich on French bread. It's my go-to sandwich and I sometimes get a craving for it. Not after tonight.  When ordering on the phone: I ordered my usual ""turkey sandwich"". What I got was a to-go take-out tray filled with green lettuce (no tomatoes, onions, or anything remotely related to salad accompaniments) -see picture of my 'side salad' .  It really wasn't even a salad. It was dry, plain greens, with the dressing on the side. Putting the salad dressing on the side was the only thing they did right. So, I get A HALF OF A TURKEY SANDWICH, which was practically tucked underneath the salad.  I really can't understand why they get this sandwich so wrong so many times. It's easy!  My sandwich was haphazardly made & shoved into a container full of plain, green lettuce. (See CORRECT sandwich from last review.) The girl who took my order over the phone said the sandwich comes with a side salad & soup. I chose wild mushroom soup, which is a fancy name for yucky (in this case). How do I delicately say my soup looked like someone had had the runs in a cup and put a lid on it. I guess if the shoe fits..... I'm serious.  Don't get the mushroom soup!  It was completely liquid, there was not 1 mushroom in it. Weird. So gross. (See picture of ""wild mushroom soup"".) I bet they throw a lot of this soup away when closing time comes. I tried calling the store manager last night, but was sent on a wild goose chase twice and never talked to a manager. So I hope he sees this and fixes the hot mess he has going on in curbside/kitchen/cook organization. It ran so smoothly a couple months ago. Please be organized!  I just spoke with ""Ashley"", store manager. She seemed to be a very young manager. I told her how horrible the food, the kitchen and take out staff were last night. Her excuse: She told me they got a lot of traffic from Comi-Con that night. The result of me trying to iron it out? Ashley said wild mushroom soup usually has a few pieces of mushroom but is generally pulverized. Yes, it was pulverized.....completely!  Don't ever order ""wild mushroom soup"" and maybe they will take this monstrosity off the menu.  Ashley said they would mail me a $10 gift card, BUT not for the total amount of what I paid ($35.13). That's such an insult. And after giving a 25% tip (FOR TAKEOUT!)!!! That's funny! I understand that sometimes crap happens, but ALL THE TIME??? Cheesecake Factory, this bad service is getting to be a habit. Ashley's tone to me: ASHLEY WAS UNPROFESSIONAL, CONDESCENDING, & COULDN'T CARE LESS!  Guest satisfaction leaves little to be desired.

The salad has grilled chicken breasts layered with mixed greens, mango, and crispy wontons tossed in their vinaigrette. This salad is light and refreshing! They use chicken breast in the orange chicken entree too, so the pieces are big. Even though it's the Americanized version, it's still really good and not so greasy. The portions here are huge, so sharing is encouraged.  Of course you can't leave without having dessert. Their cheesecakes are awesome! We sat in the patio the last time I came here, but I was burning since it was so hot and there was no shade....I had the red velvet cheesecake and since I was celebrating my birthday, they sang for me!

My last three visits were memorable experiences because the food was awful, the service horrible, and overall, I walked out the door feeling totally unsatisfied. And just for the record, the various people who joined me for lunch or dinner agreed with my assessment; each had encountered substandard service and unsavory food. Considering how pricey their menu is, the food and service should be superb. I won't bore you with the nitty-gritty details, but I had ordered the chicken sandwich with lettuce, tomatoes, avocado, and bacon. First of all, I don't know how they have the nerve to call this a chicken sandwich when 90% of the sandwich consists of bread, lettuce and tomatoes. The microscopic chicken on this sandwich was about a half inch thick, so overcooked that it was as tough as biting into a dog's rawhide chew, and it had no flavor whatsoever. After two bites, I called the waitress over, told her why I was very unhappy with my sandwich, so she took it away, asked me if I wanted something else, and surprisingly, deducted it from the bill. I spoke to the manager afterwards in a very polite and calm manner and explained my experience. He, of course, couldn't apologize enough. However, he tried to justify the situation because he had only been manager at that location for a few weeks and ""There were many issues he needed to address."" Well, that may be the case.

I wondered if it would be as good as I remember them being since my palate has matured quite a bit in my major foodie phase the last 6 yrs or more. I also wondered if my foodie bf who just moved here from NY and wasn't familiar with this place, would enjoy it.  Yes! It was surprisingly good. Possibly one of the better chicken piccatta's I've had! And I am quite picky about my piccattas. Angel hair was cooked perfectly. The piccatta sauce was creamy, flavored very tastily and it had little lemon slices on top where they scored the outer skin. I cut them up and gobbled them with the chicken which was so velvety soft, it didn't need a knife to cut it at all. So deloosh!! Lunch portion was still huge! Something they're known for, big portions. It was around $12 I think.  The bf ordered some pasta with sausage and shrimp in a red sauce and really liked it too. I took a bite and thought the shrimp was cooked perfectly and I would order this dish myself.   My old favorite, the avacado eggrolls with tamarind-cashew dipping sauce hasn't changed a bit even though I have. They were super yummy we both thought.  Service was pretty good too. We walked in at 1 pm on a Sunday afternoon after going to the AMC theaters and I knew it would be crowded and it certainly was.

288,Dennis P.,"Escondido, CA",707,125,579.0,4.0,2015-09-22,"Quick Tip: Kobe Burger is a must try. Get it medium rare. You're welcome ;) I'm going to show some love to their burger for this review. I'm sure you're asking yourself ""why did this guy order a burger at The Cheesecake Factory and why am I reading this review?"" Well, thank you for reading and yes, I ask myself the same question ""why a burger at The Cheesecake Factory?"" I'm so glad I got it. The only reason I got it was because my good friend, Brendon, who is also a burger connoisseur, recommended the Kobe Burger. If another fellow burger connoisseur says the burger is good, then it must be good! I had the The Classic Burger with Kobe beef and their brioche bun, medium rare. If you don't get your steaks or burgers medium rare...there is something wrong with you, or something wrong with me, but really medium rare was juicy, but not to the point where the burger juices are running down your hand. I can't stand a dry patty or a sloppy patty. This patty was cooked perfectly. The flavor and the texture of the patty was on point. The ratio to bun to meat was right on. The bun molded to the burger, making it so easy to pick up and put down. It puts a smile to my face when the bun can mold to the patty and become one entity, to join forces and enter the mouth of a hungry burger connoisseur.  The Classic Burger was hefty and I couldn't even finish it! I didn't want to disrespect the burger and it's ancestors, so I kept taking bites even though I was beyond full. Then I gave up because I forgot that I was at TCF! When at The Cheesecake Factory, eat like a Cheesecake Factory! wait, whaaaa? I got my burger with their house fries instead of the sweet potato fries.  I hope this review has opened your mind to the burgers at TCF. I've never had bad experiences at The Cheesecake Factory and I've been to over 5 different locations multiple times. So I'm glad to say that their servers are well trained, educated on their menu, and polite.  If you eat good food, then you will never eat bad food again. @dmagicp",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=260,3.16,3.39,3.42,2.7359999999999998,3.298

I only wanted a salad, which apparently took them 30 minutes to bring out. And they forgot the dressing. I ordered the kale & quinoa for the first time, which should just be called the kale salad because that's all that was in it. I was already in a bad mood from being hungry so forgetting to add the dressing only made me angrier. I decided to call and let them know, and they transferred the call to the manager. I couldn't be bothered to remember his name but he seemed frustrated that I didn't know the receipt/order #. My mom paid cash - why tf would she keep the receipt? He proceeded to ask me a million & one questions, where I tried to answer the best I could (since I wasn't there). I even told him what my mom and sister ordered for dinner. He said he would try to figure out what he could do for me and get back to me. This obviously shouldn't take days. All I wanted was a simple apology. And when restaurants mess up they'll usually comp your meal (or send a gift card if it was take out) not pound you with unnecessary questions then lie about doing something about it and never reach out.

I went home from my experience shaking and I woke up to write this review, to let people know how horribly this place is run and to share the experience I had. My friend and I came in for a drink at the bar we only wanted 1 shot of tequila to relax after a stressful day working. When the shot was poured, it was so tiny we felt absolutely no effects from the shot because it was so small. Mind you, this is not just about the amount of alcohol received nor the cost.  It was our Harsh treatment and humiliation we received after we complained. The senior manager instead of trying to comp or pour a little more like a dime size more to pacify our disappointment..or even come up with a solution for that matter.. He became extremely argumentative. Borderline scary. Apparently the Senior manager- JT who ruined our evening has not had any customer service training in my opinion or how to deal with complaints as he accused us of attacking him personally in front of other ""guests"" in which every time I mentioned that we are the ""customers"" and that ""our complaints should be properly acknowledged"" he lashed out correcting us that we are ""guests"" not customers. This rude and tacky correction was said four times. Embarrassing and humiliating.  To make matters worse, he started to raise his voice in front of everyone causing a scene and eventually yelled at us to GET OUT pointing his finger at the door and quickly walked away from us, not solving anything not coming up with any solution whatsoever. Was appalled as I have had 15 years in customer service and this was absolutely unacceptable. This Senior Manager JT had absolutely zero skills. As a manager, if a customer is unhappy or upset you do whatever to be polite regardless of how the customer is acting. Service is Poor. Both managers and bartender were even tacky enough to bring up how cooperate runs Cheesecake Factory like we really want to stand here talking about that. Will be filing a complaint with corporate because I think feedback is extremely important and Even the manager would not stand to listen to our feedback. This place may look like a standard good place to go after shopping but go at your own risk you may leave mad and upset.  I took my daughter there for cake on her B day and the waitress brought milks first and cake 35 minutes later I had to ask 3 times where she was it ruined the joy of eating there. I will never ever go back to this place and I don't mind telling others not to go there as well. Went in to end our day with a drink to relax, left humiliated by The Senior Manager and shocked at the lack of service skills once again I will say the management does not care about its customers or ""guests"" as they call it.  I want to add only because this was involving alcohol-we were not drunk nor did we even get a proper feeling from the 10 dollar tiniest shot in the world.

Then he sounded nice to acommodate me with the inconvenience by saying: ''I don't want you guys to leave without eating.'' I took the offer, and told him to leave a phat tip, and he seemed cheered up.  Anyhow, once we were halfway on our meal hear slightly threatened us to pay the bill with my outstanding total. My disagreement was huge, but I decided to not argue and find a proper place to get my dollars out of my European card. Once I arrived, the server took my mone and didn't offer me the RECEIPT!

Cheesecake Factory is the kind of corporate restaurant at every corner, almost like a Starbucks, except it's calorie count is well over double that of a Venti Caramel Frapp with extra whipped cream.  Most of Cheesecake's meals are well over 1500 calories....  Thankfully they now have the ""Skinnylicious"" menu.  The real deal is the portions are smaller ...(I mean just right ...)There are some tasty items including the turkey burger , and some salads and pastas. But ... How could you ignore the regular menu and the free batches of white hot sourdough or wheat bread and butter?  Their menu consists of something for everyone...appetizers, Asian food , breakfast, burgers and big salads, soups and soul food (chili and jambalaya ) and my favorite page of the menu...12... Pasta !  Pasta favorites include Louisiana chicken pasta and the garlic farfalle. For you simple but garlic lovers, the spaghetti with marinara is off menu but absolutely tasty and delicious. Off of page 12, includes one of my pasta favorites ...Chicken Bellagio. It has a basil pesto pasta with a cream sauce underneath , foreign ham to top, arugula and two big slabs of thin crispy tender chicken that I can never finish.  A non pasta other favorite is the chicken n biscuits. Yup.  Favorite appetizers so far are the Mac N cheese Balls and the Avocado Egg Rolls. Must try!!! The line is exceptionally long (30 minutes plus) over the weekend , but hey grab a pager and go shopping. There is a nicely remodeled heated patio that sometimes is warmer than outside (and much quieter). Service is friendly and knowledgable , never had an issue.

172,Lisa G.,"Poway, San Diego, CA",824,404,3500.0,4.0,2015-12-18,"Dropped by here for a company dinner yesterday. Felt a bit bad as we were one of those large groups and we ended up having to wait a half hour to a hour after we were seated as our main people for the night were stuck in traffic. The waiter was very sweet and patient though our group was a bit loud and bickering in Chinese. We ended up ordering some appetizers first and making small talk until the entire group arrived. My to go to at ANY Cheesecake Factory is the Buffalo Blasts and the Thai Lettuce Wraps. I went to the one in Long Island back in NY a lot so I knew what I was getting myself into. Buffalo Blasts had chicken and cheese combined together within a crispy outer layer that you could put some blue cheese or hot sauce in to make a delicious medley in your mouth. Almost like some fireworks. But yes, that is my favorite to get. Thai Lettuce Wraps was another one of my staples to get as it is light and easy to digest. Just put everything in the lettuce and wrap it. Wa-lah~. Other appetizers like the fried calamari and the avocado eggrolls were pretty good too. Fried calamari is like at every food place - so pretty much self explanatory. Avocado eggrolls were nicely toasted when coming out though the display on one of the ones that came out clearly stated that it was rushed. But hey, food's food! I tried the Steak Diane (a piece of it from my coworker's place) later on - and must say, that is a pretty delicious piece of meat. Cheesecake Factory knows what they are doing! I was way too full to finish my Shepherd's Pie but my cousin finished that once I got home so I would say it was good. Service was on point - only not so good thing is that they don't take reservations. Heard from my coworkers who left early to score us that spot that they were waiting for quite some time while everyone else tried to beat rush hour traffic. Would most definitely recommend to anyone whose craving something not too upscale and not too casual - but maybe in the middle.

For entree I recommend the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta. Comes with sweet chipotle pasta sauce, tortilla chips for that perfect crunch, and penne pasta cooked nice and aldente.

My review is based on a recent dining experience.  We opted to sit outside mainly for the shorter wait time, but also for fesh air and it's not as loud as the inside can get. When we sat down we were seated near a heat lamp which helped.  I regrettably didn't get our servers name, as this review is based mostly on the service. After we ordered, the sun moved and it was shinning right on my mom's face. Even with sunglasses on, it wouldn't have been the best experience to have the sun right on your face. We asked the server if we could move to a different table outside that didn't shine right on us (and perhaps I should have asked the hostess instead). He turned our table just slightly and instead of the sun shinning right on her face it was right up against the side. This made us right up next to the chairs for the table behind us. This didn't help and it didn't seem as if he was willing to move us, so we switched seats.  To eat, I had the California avocado salad and I asked for the dressing on the side. When our food came, my salad came but no dressing. I asked for dressing. I told everyone to start eating as my dressing would soon be out. No dressing came and our server didn't even come out to check on us. No where in sight. Everyone started to slowly stop eating as I hadn't even started as and they were half way through. I got up and looked around the patio for our server. No where. I went inside and looked around where the kitchen was. No where. Finally another server saw me looking around and asked if I needed something. I told her I hadn't gotten my dressing and she said she'd bring it right out. At least she was willing to help.  Finally I get my dressing and I can eat. The food at Cheesecake is consistent and most of the dishes are good.  I will probably be back to cheesecake at some point, but it would help if service was better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=120,3.08,3.18,3.384,3.1480000000000006,3.1400000000000006

Me and a friend went in for some grub and were seated immediately...which was nice. Then no one checked on us for a good 10 minutes. A server finally walked over and introduced herself, we placed our drink orders and she repeated it back to me incorrectly 3 times. Headed down the wrong path already. It probably took a good 15 minutes for the drinks to show up. My friend's martini was made wrong. I had a mojito, it was mediocre at best. Then no server again. We're starving at this point, she finally passed by and asks if we need a few more minutes...I thought to myself, yea if you give us any more time we'd probably pass out. We place our food order, friend gets the fried mac and cheese, I order the chicken scampi. Then another server come up and introduces herself as the replacement as our original server went home. I will include a picture of my dish. It was the most bland, under salted, diluted dish I've ever tasted. I asked the service very politely if I could get a side of Alfredo sauce, and to my disappointment, that was completely watered down...it looked like some milk in a bowl and tasted as such. In the photo you can clearly see how the sauce doesn't even coat the pasta, it was dry, chicken was pale as a ghost...looks as if they boiled it or something. Overall huge disappointment. Server showed absolutly no concern for whether or not we liked our food. I took two bites from my dish, and the server asked if I wanted a box dryly, I refused and she brought us the check.

We waited patiently right next to the front desk while others who came in well after us were seated, one by one. After about 20 minutes, I checked status. Apparently, our name somehow disappeared from their system. They put us on stand by and we had to wait 20 more minutes for a total of 40. We wanted to leave at that point but we were so hungry that we felt compelled to stay. Things got worse. We were seated at one of the worst tables in the joint outside, right next to the server POS. We weren't even acknowledged by a server for at least 10 minutes. When we were, it was some middle aged, apathetic gentleman who seemed to want to be anywhere other than work.

Complimentary Bread Fettuccini Alfredo - My favorite yet!  Sauce is so creamy & flavorful! Crispy Chicken Costoletta = Served with mashed potatoes & asparagus - Refreshing dish with the lemon seasoning.  Chicken is nicely crisped on the outside but unfortunately dry.  There is sauce that the chicken lays upon & I was continuously  dipping each piece in it to add some juicyness.  Sadness, it did not help. Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake - I never considered this cheesecake before but I am glad that my boyfriend picked it out.  It was sweet & light with several banana pieces.  The crust seemed like a mixture between a traditional graham cracker crust & a pie crust.  I think they should add a drizzle of caramel sauce...

175,Sylvia H.,"San Diego, CA",56,147,1274.0,4.0,2016-01-11,"This place is always pretty busy, probably because its popular and being located in Fashion Valley Mall, which itself is always busy, doesn't help. Came on a Sunday around 6pm and was told it would be 15 minutes, but was seated within 10! It is a bit loud, but we were seated in a corner by the window, so it was nice, quiet and intimate. The seats were comfortable. There is also a large outdoor patio. There is lots of room for large groups. Its pretty casual for a sit down place and seems totally kid friendly.  Our server, Lymn, was really friendly, quick and attentive. He explained everything and answered all of our questions thoroughly. Nothing went wrong with our order and he fulfilled all our special requests. He's definitely one of the better waiters I've had in recent memory.  The menu here is huge and very varied. Its best to come somewhat prepared knowing the general ""category / type"" of food you are looking for so you can narrow it down a bit. There is a Skinnylicious (lighter choices) menu too, which is nice, especially considering this place is known to be a calorie bomb. The complimentary bread was nice. The sourdough was dry and too crunchy, though. However, the honey wheat bread was so good. It arrived warm and a bit crunchy on the outside but soft and the inside. Worth the trip, right there. Our food arrived quickly, hot and fresh.  I had the MEXICAN CHICKEN LETTUCE WRAP TACOS ($6.95) from the Skinnylious and Starters/Small Plates Menu.  Butter Lettuce Leaves Filled with Grilled Chicken and Avocado, Tomato, Onion, Cilantro, Roasted Corn Salsa and Crema. I asked for extra butter lettuce and boy did they deliver; it felt like I almost got a side salad (very fresh one at that). The chicken was perfectly grilled and flavorful. There were only about 5 good sized pieces, so its a lighter meal, but still filling. There were huge chunks of perfectly ripe avocado. The salsa was well spiced and flavourful, with the cilantro and lime being prominent. The crema sauce on the side was not as spicy as the salsa, but well seasoned. Overall, it was a great tasting meal with good quality ingredients and a good value.  My friend had an appetizer (BEETS WITH GOAT CHEESE Fresh Beets, Apples, Baby Arugula, Pecans and Vinaigrette from the Skinnylious menu $6.95). The beets were nicely cooked, but there weren't that many of them. There were generous portions of goat cheese though. Her entree was the CHICKEN BELLAGIO (Crispy Coated Chicken Breast over Basil Pasta and Parmesan Cream Sauce Topped with Prosciutto and Arugula Salad). There was a large portion of prosciutto, but it was cut rather thick which is odd. I didn't try this, but it looked good and  she really enjoyed both her choices. She took 1/2 her entree home; the portions are really substantial.  Overall, if you don't mind a bit of noise and wait, the place is comfortable, the service was great and the food quality, taste and value are really good. I'll definitely be back to try something else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=120,3.2,3.16,3.36,3.472,3.1760000000000006

There will always be a wait during peak dining hours, there is an extensive menu with the nutritional values to ruin the fun, the portions are huge, and the food is overpriced for being mediocre. However, if you are a restaurant snob like me and you avoid American chain restaurants (unless someone else if paying), the Cheesecake Factory, out of all the chains, is superior only because it is a step up from a Chili's, Applebee's, or Friday's.

Me and one of my besties were boot shopping, decided to come here for dinner. We found 2 seats at the bar, thank goodness because the wait was crazy busy. The bar staff was amazing that night, compliments to you for keeping sane despite how busy it was.  We started with the egg roll sampler, four different kind. It was an awesome way to try the different appetizer egg rolls on the menu. I have always loved their version and BJ's version of the avocado egg roll. The firecracker salmon egg roll was also excellent, will definitely re-order these. The other two egg rolls were good, but didn't stand out like the previous two that I mentioned.  We also decided to split a salad for an entree and my friend has been craving buffalo chicken strips. The fresh vegetable salad is out of this world good, loved all the components in it, the perfect mix of veggies. I placed portions on my plate the way it was plated and ate across, slowly eating each element and not just tossing it all together, sooooo good. The buffalo chicken strips stayed nice and crunchy, even with the buffalo coating.  Of course my friend ordered dessert, she always needs that touch of sweet at the end. I rarely order dessert here because it's super decadent and I'm usually way too full because of the portion sizes, but then she started talking about a mango cheesecake and I was in to try it.

148,Steve F.,"San Diego, CA",916,1167,5947.0,4.0,2016-02-25,"""CONSUME MASS QUANTITIES!"" That quote from Coneheads best describes how I feel whenever I stop by The Cheesecake Factory chain - large portion sizes from a menu that has almost every type of cuisine so loaded with calories that you need to walk your @$$ around the block a few times afterwards to burn it off.  But, when the food tastes that good, it's almost worth it! We came here a couple of nights ago to treat our mom to a belated Valentine's Day dinner.  While there's no same-day reservations offered, it's a good idea to have someone get here early to get a buzzer before the rest of your party gets there (which is what I did, seeing how I work relatively close by).  After about a twenty minute wait, we were seated and eventually made our choices (as I mentioned, that menu has almost everything but the kitchen sink). My mom ordered the Chicken and Biscuits, my brother went with the Pit Beef Dip (similar to a French Dip with au jus), and my choice was the Kobe Beef Burger.  While my mom liked the gravy with her dish, and my burger was pretty juicy (the grilled onions and mushrooms helped... even though the dressing was on the side, my burger didn't really need it), my brother was kinda disappointed with his sandwich.  Even though he finished it much to mine and our mother's surprise, he thought it was a bit on the dry side.  The tableside bread that we got prior to our orders also helped fill us up - it was pretty warm with a chewy crust, though I felt that the sourdough was better than the wheat. And of course, the dessert.  If there's at least one good thing that The Cheesecake Factory does really well, it's the myriad of cheesecake choices to choose from.  My mom went with something simple - the classic cheesecake with strawberries - and after one bite from each of us and the realization that it was very rich and sweet, we were done.  What's left of the cheesecake slice is still in the fridge, tempting us... Though the music was a bit too loud (even when the dining room emptied a bit during dinner service, it seemed like it was at full blast), the ambiance is surprisingly comfortable.  Our server did a great job checking on us, bringing us our orders, and refilling our water glasses.  Interestingly, The Cheesecake Factory has its own merchandise; while the stuffed animals seemed a bit cliché, the pins had my interest piqued. As there's a happy hour between 4-6pm (where hopefully the fried calamari is a $5 app option), as well as a Sunday brunch where the Crab Hash is calling my name, think I'll keep this chain in mind for next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=100,3.84,3.23,3.444,3.184,3.474

1301,Julianne V.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,8,,1.0,2016-03-03,"My husband and I recently went to the Cheesecake Factory in the North County Fair mall, Escondido. We thought we'd give them another try to get it right. Unfortunately, like two previous occasions we were disappointed. We went early to avoid the dinner rush, there were very few other diners. The wait staff was slow to even acknowledge we were there. When we finally were able to place an order, it took over 40 minutes to receive our meals. My pasta dish came out  first but my husbands (burger and fries) was no where to be seen. When his food did arrive (10 minutes later) my food was cold and the taste was lacking to say the least. We came to dine together not separately  Our waitress never once checked in on us to see if we had any needs. I asked to speak to the manager. It took some time before he came our table. He looked at my untouched meal and said,  ""what, you didn't like it?""   When I explained my situation, he agreed that it was not proper protocol to bring dishes out separately but he was noticeably reluctant to act upon it so I prompted him by stating that I refused to pay for it. The wait staff did eventually get something right and removed my portion from the bill. Three strikes Cheesecake factory, we will seek any other place to dine when we shop at North County Fair.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=980,3.72,3.21,3.436,3.0120000000000005,3.414
480,Kiarra S.,"Riverside, CA",6,45,26.0,1.0,2016-03-03,By one of the worst experiences I've had at a Cheesecake Factory. My boyfriend and I went on a Sunday night and it was a horrible mistake. First of all we didn't get bread when we were first seated. We had to ask almost 20min of being seated. Then we ordered strawberry lemonades and they were watered down. My boyfriend told the waitress and she said ok I'll get you new drinks from the menu but I wouldn't order any lemonades. So my question is why would you serve a drink you know isn't good. I honestly couldn't believe the lack of customer service that night. Now our food was horrible . I had the chicken bellagio and the serving was smaller than usual. The food was very salty. My boyfriend had the fettuccine alfredo and it was soooo salty!

I love all the variations of cheesecake they offer but with some of the recipes, it ceases to be cheesecake if it has too many ingredients.  I love cheesecake plain and simple and I don't mind a variety like the one I tried today: The Salted Caramel. Delicious! Graham cracker crust, caramel, cheesecake.....Honey hush! This was awesome. That's about it. What can I tell you that you don't already know. If you've never eaten at a Cheesecake Factory, I'm sure you'll find something you like. If you have, you've nothing else to try except a different variation of cheesecake.

My favs are... As opposed to spending twice as much on steak at Ruth Chris, I can enjoy a well cooked, flavorful steak here: 1) Rib Eye Steak 2) Filet Mignon (Medium well, butterfly cut) For when my palate craves pungent garlic.  3) Pasta Carbonara 4) Garlic Noodles Of the chicken options, I'd go with the crispy texture of the: 5) Chicken Piccata I favor the white sauces over the red (sometimes tastes too bland for my taste, almost like store bought canned red sauce with bits of meat.) The alfredo is creamy and buttery, but if you wanted to pick a red sauce, go with the: -Farfalle with Chicken & Roasted Garlic My favorite dessert picks would be: 1) Linda's Fudge Chocolate Cake 2) Dulce de Leche 3) Macadamia cheesecake Each cake is so decadent and rich, I could only eat 1/3 each sitting. I usually take the rest to go to either share or eat for dessert again the next day. Not a fan of their new anniversary cheesecake though because I personally think there were too many flavor combinations that didn't compliment well with another.  Also not a fan of their customer service, which was why I deducted a star. Almost 90% of the time that we dined there, the waiter/waitress seemed to be overly rushed, distracted (like chickens with their heads chopped off) and in 1 instance a newbie didn't know how to process my gift card and didn't bother to ask how to fix the problem or ask the mgmt for help. We aren't high maintenance picky eaters. I wasn't demanding that they baby sat us.

The cheesecake display was already making me hungry that I was deciding right then which one to take home. My family got the calamari and avocado rolls to start. Calamari was brought out warm. Some pieces were tough and felt it was battered a bit too much. They forgot lemon, so be sure to ask them. Table set up was off because they had sat us in a booth. Wish the servers paid more attention to the diners and space. The booth was small and I was in smashed in the corner by my two brothers but luckily I'm a small girl. So, table space was small trying to accommodate 3 drinks and 2 hot teas.  Bread came in fresh and the butter was really cold. Speaking of cold, the AC was blasting but I think they had no control over it, it was perfect temp for the servers though who were always moving. AC had eventually stopped which made eating for enjoyable. Avocado rolls were next, there was six pieces and it was chuncky and crunchy fresh delicious (I could've ate my own) So I got Evelyn's pasta with angel hair. I wish there was more veggies, there is no meat in it but the pine nuts made it hearty good. There was eggplant, zucchini, and olives that stood out in the dish. My older brother ordered shrimp with beans and rice, it was supposed to come with plantain which he was looking forward to, but was informed last minute that they were out. He was disappointed. I wished the server had checked on the ingredients in stock prior to the dish coming out. The server had already come with his dish and informing plantains had run out (assuming cuban dish) it lacked in character for both food and service. Very poorly executed. Other dished turned out fine, the chicken piccata looked great and the salmon with mashed potatoes looked very good.      Despite some set backs in the food and service, dining with family made it better.

Finally our waiter comes out and tells me the kitchen made a mistake and the noodles were delivered to another table. Is that really the kitchen's mistake, or the server's? Hmmm... 10 MORE minutes go by and the manager comes over and apologizes for the delay. She tells me the noodles were delivered to another table and the patrons at that table ate the noodles. Fine, it happens. She asks me if I want a soup or salad; I decline. The noodles came out shortly after that and after waiting almost an hour for the noodles, my appetite wasn't what it was when I first walked in.  The check comes and the noodles were still on the check. Now perhaps I sound like a cheapskate, but one would think taking a $14 meal off of a check in order to provide good customer service shouldn't be an issue. How about offering a slice of cheesecake?

After 30 minutes the bartender realizes we didn't have our food so he grabs a nearby server and asks ""hey can you grab a manager or something to get this Togo food"". Then we wait another 10 minutes finally the food comes with no comment from the bar team or manager presence. We get back to the hotel and of course here I am eating my over salted rib eye and Mac and cheese also extremely salty heated up in the microwave. With a nice side of ice cold pizza.

822,Samantha S.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,5,2.0,1.0,2016-08-27,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory often I love the food and I love the cheesecake. Last night we went for a friends birthday I am so disappointed cause I have never gotten such bad waiter before in my life. First off she takes our drink orders she got two of them wrong. We asked for bread when she ordered our drinks and when the drinks arrived there was no bread. We had to ask her a few more times until she finally brought the bread out. Eventually our food arrives she can't remember what we ordered and put the wrong plates down in front of us. When she starts switching the plates she spilled one of our drinks. My friend never got a new one and she didn't even apologize. The food was delicious we were having a good time. She asked us if she wanted to split the checks we said yes but she walked away while we were telling her how to split them. One of my friends volunteered to cover my friends since it was her birthday. She came back with the checks my friend asked for the check that was my friends and the waitress responded with such attitude saying ""you didn't order that"" than after my friend said she was covering hers she threw both of the checks down in front of her and walked away. We also had to reminder her five times it was our friends birthday and if she could bring out the sundae. She wouldn't pick up the checks even though we kept saying excuse me whenever she walked by. Eventually we got up to walk to the front to see if someone could ring us up she stopped us than gave major attitude again. I don't think I will ever return to this Cheesecake Factory location again. If I do I will definitely get up and leave or ask for a different waiter if I ever get Alexis again.

We sat on the patio near the door....and here comes Shelby.. yelling out two employees that were following her (I need you two to hurry up...that's what I need you to do)..attitude and all..SMH. We did let our server know as well as the Manager. He stated he would talk with her, however she still had a stank face going on while we were there. That leads me to think Shelby was probably the Manager's side chick or something???? On top of the bad service..we ordered Sangria's at 11.95 ea... I did not taste a lick of alcohol...NOTHING!

291,Hungry M.,"San Diego, CA",0,7,1.0,1.0,2016-10-23,"This is my first time writing a bad review. I normally don't like to give bad reviews because I understand that sometimes people had off days but my whole experience at this establishment was horrible. I have dined here many times over the years and I will not be coming back after this visit.  We were seated an hour and a half before our movie was started. I was two other people and only two of us were going to eat because the third person wasn't hungry. Our order was a pasta dish and ""The Factory Burger."" Nothing complicated right? Shouldn't take close to 40 mins to cook right? Wrong. We waiting for about 40 mins to get our food. The couple next to us were seated about 10 mins after we were and got their complete meal before we did. They had an appetizer and guess what else they ordered??? Two burgers. I had to ask the waiters twice about our food. This alone was not enough to make the dining experience unpleasant. I understand that sometimes things happen. What made me angry enough to write a negative review was the fact that my ""Factory Burger"" was nothing but bread, a slice of tomato, a slice of cheese, and a few pieces of grilled onions. The bread they used were the stale sourdough they typically serve you before you get your meal. It wasn't warm or crispy. It was stale and chewy like a rubber shoe. If you are going to charge people close to $13 for a burger at least toast the bread. That was the most pathetic ""burger"" I have ever had. I couldn't even finish it. Fed it to the dog when I got home. Jack-in-the-Box serve better burgers. Also, the pasta dish we got was bland and extremely heavy on the cream.  The waiters walked past our table several times. I placed my empty cup near the edge of the table so they would notice that I needed a refill. Nope. Not a single person noticed. I had plenty of staff members walk by our table and look directly at our table. I had to call them over for a refill. Come on now. If you are a waiter and you ""check"" on your customer's table you should have the common sense to look at people's drinks to see if they need refills.  I have been a loyal customer for years but I will not be coming back to this establishment in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=260,2.96,3.05,3.252,2.084,3.014

339,Theresa N.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,2.0,3.0,2016-10-29,"If you go any time around lunch or dinner during the weekend, there will pretty much definitely be at least a 20 minute wait for a table. Last time I tried, they don't do reservations more than an hour in advance, so keep that in mind if you're hungry. I tried getting around this by ordering curbside pickup, but even that was a long wait since the staff is so busy that time of day- I was on hold for 10 minutes to place the order and half an hour when I came to pick it up before I ended up just going in to bug them for my order. If you can get past the wait time though, once you get seated the waiters and servers are very welcoming and will go out of their way to get you what you need, despite how busy they are. Super friendly and accommodating staff! The pumpernickel (brown) bread is super addictive, so save room for your entree. My go-to is the angel hair spaghetti with shrimp; not too heavy but very filling. All of their cheesecakes are delicious but I can usually only get a few bites in and take the rest to go since they are so rich. My favorite is the vanilla bean with a side of caramel sauce.

We were seated outside which wasn't bad. We were given menus so we decided what we wanted. It took about 10 minutes for a server to come around and ask what drinks we wanted. I ordered a Sangria and my friend ordered a mango daiquiri. She didn't even try to card us.... isn't that illegal? I just passed her my ID anyways but she didn't even card my friend. Anyways, we also told her our food orders right then and there. I ordered a lunch size Caesar salad with chicken.  She brought us the waters quickly but it took around 45 minutes for another server to bring out the alcoholic drinks. I know it was busy but I was expecting the drinks would come out way before they actually did. When I finally got my sangria, it tasted like Kool aid. The food came 5-10 minutes later. Everyone at my table wasn't going to eat until everyone got their food. My simple salad came a few minutes after everyone else got their food (they all got hot plates).  We finished our food and our server didn't even come by til about 10 minutes after we finished. She collected our plates and one of my friends ordered a slice of cheesecake. Surprisingly the cheesecake came within 5 minutes. We each had a bite or 2 of the cheesecake and we were done. Then it took her about 15 minutes to ask how we wanted to split the check. Then 10 minutes later she finally came around with the checks. It took her another 10 minutes to process the checks, which is understandable because we were all doing separate.

As usual, there's plenty of it and I took half of it home. My date ordered the chicken marsala. She had the opposite reaction than I did. She felt like it was thinner than it should've been and not tangy enough.  We ordered the tower cake to go. I'll have to let you know another time how good it was. The atmosphere is loud because of the high ceilings, but mood lighting makes you feel like you can have a private conversation.   All in all, we decided that if we came back it would be for lunch. The outside patio looks inviting, but it was too chilly tonight. The total bill for two meals, a Mohito, and ice tea, and one slice of tower cake, was $60.70 plus tip. We both have plenty of leftovers for tomorrow, unless the teenager gets to it first. EDIT:  OMG!!! The cake is to die for!!!!! Chocolate lovers dream!!!  If I could add 1/2 a star for it I would.  To the manager who commented, the only thing I could have asked you to fix would have been the Mohito.

Last night I tried Chris's outrageous Cheesecake, layers of chocolate and coconut goodness. It's similar to a German cake. If you're a coconut lover this is the cake for you.

Servers are very friendly and always come back and check on your table every once in a while.  I always end up getting pasta dishes because the portions are huge! You pay for what you're getting. My regular is the pasta da Vinci, penne pasta with chicken and mushrooms. I tried the Louisiana chicken pasta and that was good too. It was nice and creamy with a kick of spice and the chicken was nicely breaded and had a crunch in every bite.  My bf has the Jamaican black pepper shrimp served with rice.

The wait time (at 2 in the afternoon, mind you) was a half an hour or so, which was a little annoying but completely to be expected since it's in Fashion Valley. The place was packed but for whatever reason there were a number of empty tables both inside and out- maybe they didn't have enough staff? Our waitress was very sweet and did a great job even though she was clearly hustling running back and forth between tables. I went with the gumbo because I'm physically incapable of resisting anything that has andouille sausage in it, and was blown away with the flavor. The meat was great quality, and the broth had a rich, spicy, buttery flavor that was just fantastic. Put together with the pile of rice it comes with, I was in complete gumbo heaven. Dessert was a Hershey's cheesecake, but being completely honest, the gumbo made me much happier. One of the nice things about this location is that it has such a large patio. It's less crowded and noisy than indoors, and on a warm Saturday afternoon it was the perfect place to enjoy a meal. The parking can be tricky since it's in Fashion, but if you actually find parking this is a great place to get your fix- because the menu is enormous so there's really nothing you could want that isn't on the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=60,3.44,2.92,3.208,3.216,3.128

As a former server of your customers can tell your struggling it's not professional. And the customer is always right when it comes to what they want.

I went to the Women's restroom around 4:00pm and notices that the stall I was in was very very low on toilet paper. I let the girl waiting to take my stall out of courtesy in case she wanted to wait for a different stall. The bathroom itself looked dirty and the trash was overflowing. I let the hostess with long light brown hair know that the restroom was very low on toilet paper and continued to wait for my table. Around 4:40pm I heard 3 different women complain to one of the managers that the Women's bathroom was disgusting and had NO TOILET PAPER! These women were all very angry, one even complained that her son was literally on the toilet waiting  for someone to bring toilet paper for over 10 mins. This got me very irritated especially since I told the hostess at 4:00pm that the toilet paper was running low and now it was 40 mins later. The manager was apologetic and got people in there to clean up and restock but still this shouldn't happen ever especially considering the amount of employees working at the time. Makes you question how often they check on the restrooms. If I would have been that hostess, I would have gone in there myself and resupplied the toilet paper or alerted the manager right away to get someone to do it ASAP. This could have been avoided.

So my friend and I just shared our food with them and the sever told the manager about what happened and all she can say was i am sorry for what happened with the mini corn dogs. And when my friend went to pay she had asked to talk to the manager and the manager didn't even offer to give my friend a discount of off our bill for what happened to our kids food my friend had to ask for the discount.

The hostess sits us at a table that still has bread crumbs on it that  she clearly had to see when she placed the menu on top of them.  My knife had a piece of lent on it and then when we were given our forks and napkins for dessert there was a giant hair on the white napkin as clear as day. The waiter walks away and as he sees me reach for another fork from the many empty tables around us he asks if we want another fork. Uh, ya, and a napkin please.

464,Samantha V.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,1.0,1.0,2017-03-05,"My first time going to the Cheesecake Factory was not a good experience! I needed to make reservations for a party of 12. So when I called to make a reservation they told me that they don't make reservations. So I decided on a Saturday night it might get busy so I showed up an hour early. It was around 5 I told them I had a party of 12 they said it would be an hour and a half wait. They told me it could have been faster if I made reservations which apparently they do only 1 hour before they open. So they need to clarify some information with their employees, I definitely did not want to sit around and wait that whole time. Also the place was so packed I could barley talk to the hosts who seemed way to busy to talk to me. They were ignoring me and more interested in socializing. I went in after an hour went by to check on how much longer It would be and she looked at me like I was asking her such a difficult question and with lots of attitude she said ""well you've only been waiting an hour, so"" the way she said it made it seem like an hour is not long time. Well it definitely it when you start getting hangry. I started noticing that people who were coming in after me were already leaving. 2 hours and waiting we finally get seated at 7. Then our waitress comes and let me tell you she was EVERYWHERE. I understand we were a big party but she was giving people the wrong drinks even drinks from different tables. The food took FOREVER to come out and when it finally did either it was food meant for another table or she forgot what they had and didn't even know they were missing it. I was expecting the food to taste amazing since it took forever to come out and I was wrong again!We asked for to go boxes and she forgot about that and so we reminded her twice and we never got them. It was basically pointless to ask again. The next time somebody invites me to go to this Cheesecake Factory I will definitely suggest someplace else.

I also shared a Caesar salad with my girlfriend which was also great. For her main dish, my girlfriend ordered a flatbread. She said it was okay, but the tomatoes on it were not that good. I just ordered an appetizer of loaded baked potato tots which I get all the time. Those were very good as always. My dad, however, got chicken Parmesan pizza style. He expected a pizza with chicken parm on it, with pasta. But, it turned out to be all chicken, pounded into a circular shape, with a lot of cheese and then noodles on top. Very interesting concept, but also misdescribed entirely on the menu. It was okay, not great. Our server TJ was very good and attentive, and when he asked my dad what he thought of the chicken parm dish, my dad was honest with him and said he did not enjoy it because it was not what he expected. TJ took it off our bill immediately without us even asking.

So when our food did come out, salad and pasta, by the way, we were happy to finally have our entrees. Except the quality was not as good as other CCF I've been too, though. Now, we were there, trying to recover from waiting an hour for subpar entrees, when the manager came out and asked the table right beside ours to move so they could make room for a 30 top group, and can you believe it, it was a group of teenagers! Not a foot away from us. The table that moved got a larger booth and free desserts, us? Suffer.  We got boxes, skipped the cheesecake (usually my reason for going here), and got out immediately.

While waiting for our food to arrive we were introduced to Paul who was supposed to be our waiter but had been on lunch. Well this is where it all went down hill. We had asked for the umbrella to be closed because it was windy we didn't have any of their fancy heaters near by and the sun was rather nice on the skin rather than burning. We're told one of the busboys would close it (they never came) we received our food 40+ minutes later (almost 230 by now) and it was cold ( fried chicken tenders with fries for the kids and my spicy chicken chipotle pasta) and still no sight or interaction with Paul since our introduction. 20 minutes later (seriously we eat rather fast or maybe starving from all the wait) still no Paul, no closed umbrella, freezing cold , empty plates and waiting for the check. Another 20 minutes or so we finally see Paul where at this point forget a whole cake for birthday I want to get to my car and get warm. Got the bill left the money I was over it. This whole entire time I saw other waiters dedicating their time on their designated tables (not rush hour yet ) and constantly making sure they were ok and my family was just THERE..... I for sure will not be stopping by to this location any time soon I rather wait for a table at red lobster where I know I will be given my food right out of the oven and actual be bothered by my waiter for constantly asking if I need a refill than coming back here.

I expected nothing but great service and food, but unfortunately it was totally the opposite. We had terrible service since we got there. Order drinks we got them an hour later. The food took even longer. My father in law ordered a medium rib eye steak that was 27 dollars!! But he got what looked like an 8oz well done steak that was cooked on a griddle instead of an actual grill!! Father in law has been a  professional chef for many years and knows his steaks so he decided to return it. Meanwhile everyone else tried to continue along with their meals. However, this simple act was an entire challenge all on its own as our server decided to disappear for the remainder of our stay. We NEVER got asked if we wanted a refill on ANY of our drinks. No soda, no water, no coffee, no beer. NOTHING!!! No one even came to ask us if we needed anything. We finished our diners and my father in law was still waiting for his steak. Another 20 minutes went by and the manager finally shows up to apologize but by this point everyone was done with the horrible service so we just asked her to give us the darn steak to go. When we finally got it we opened the box and found a larger piece of steak than the one they had initially brought out BUT it was cut STRAIT DOWN THE MIDDLE!!!! Totally unprofessional. This is by FAR the WORST dining experience we have EVER had!! EVER!!!  We can honestly say that we will never return to this location.

You could have told us from the beginning it's gonna take longer than 25 min). Again we waited another 20 min total of 45 min!

81,Kev O.,"Irvine, CA",32,389,860.0,3.0,2017-04-16,"Came here for dinner as the mall it's located at was just behind where we were staying for the weekend....so we didn't need to drive anywhere. I probably don't need to say too much about the Cheesecake factory as they're all decorated with the same theme.  Came here about 7pm and there was a huge crowd waiting outside the door.....now it was just a guessing game as to how long we had to wait to get a table. I went up to the check in counter and asked the guy how long a wait for two would be....he said about 35 minutes. No problem....thank goodness the mall is just there, so we were given a buzzer and went off to the mall to do some shopping to pass the time. On the dot, about 35 minutes later the buzzer went off and back we rushed. Thank goodness the buzzer worked all the way in the mall....as I was afraid it may have been out of range. Service was actually very good considering the place was totally packed inside and outside in the outdoor patio. We were kind of hungry so ordered a couple of appetizers to start....my usual CF Guacamole Eggrolls and the Chicken Samosas. And for mains I ordered the Skinnylicious Chicken Enchilada, and my friend ordered the Eggplant Parmesan.  My enchiladas weren't bad, but I thought red chile sauce was too strong and overpowered the taste of the enchiladas....secondly, the Escabeche Vegetable Salad didn't seem to go well with the enchiladas......it tasted like pickled vegetables you'd get at an Asian restaurant....I didn't enjoy this very much. I took a bite of my friend's eggplant Parmesan ad pasta.....it actually tasted yummy....the pasta was perhaps a bit dry though. Overall, our dinner experience here was just ok....nothing really wow'd us. However, most disappointing were the guacamole eggrolls.....the skin is supposed to be crispy, but outs was soggy. And, I do recall when the guac eggrolls were first introduced years ago, there was much more filling than what we got here tonight. The Chicken Samosas were quite good...but could have used more spice in the filling.

The milk can be seen dripping down the side of the seat and the host still seated a group of teenagers who didn't notice till they sat in it. The bathrooms are just as bad and overloaded with toilet paper and my wife was afraid to flush(just like the everyone before.) what's said is there was an employee in there wiping down the toilets when my wife went in there. But to top it all off the steak she ordered had a medium length hair in it. The waitress promptly took it back and returned with a steak that just happened to be on the grill. What's amazing is it had the same side cut she had put in it before returning.

While the wait can be quite long during peak hours on weekends, we usually like to eat a little earlier and get seated within ten to fifteen minutes of adding our name to the list. One of our favorite things is that until 5pm, the menu has a ""lunch special"" page that is offered. You can choose from a wide variety of items and they are not only discounted prices, but also a smaller portion which is something we like. I always feel like the regular portions are just way too big... But maybe that's just me! My go-to dish is the chicken piccata and it is offered during the lunch hour which is nice. It comes with angel hair pasta, chicken breast, and a lemon caper sauce with mushrooms. While many people may think I'm crazy for what I'm about to say next based on the fact that this is a review of The Cheesecake Factory, I make a couple modifications to the chicken piccata to make it a little healthier. I ask for rice instead of the pasta and, most importantly, for the sauce on the side. It's just as delicious and I never feel weighed down after eating it.

The menu is very broad and there is always something you want to eat. At one point, when Dan was not there, my knife fell to the floor. At least 20 employees passed over it without comment, with one waitress giggling to another server ""It looks like the customers are messy tonight!"" as she looked down at the knife and kept on walking. Finally, I think it was Brian who happily retrieved the errant knife. I mentioned it to Dan, and manager Jessica Darlington came over and we had a nice chat about the restaurant.

She gave me some good attitude even after apologizing that it was my mistake.

185,Catherine V.,"San Diego, CA",34,36,10.0,2.0,2017-07-12,"So I've been a regular at the Cheesecake Factory for a couple of years now. The first time I went I was blown away by how beautiful the setting was, and how delicious the food tasted, not to mention the service was fantastic. After that, I was hooked. However, ever since then I have only experienced sub-par of the aforementioned. Let me give a few examples of how they missed the mark.  1. Curbside mess: I asked for extra sauce for my pasta and a smoothie. They brought out the food and I looked inside the bag to check the order. The sauce cup had vent holes in the top, and the sauce was leaking. I brought it to the girls attention and she said, oh sorry about that, then it was like paaaauuse. Soooo, instead of her offering to take the bag in and clean it up or offer anything for that matter, I asked her for some extra napkins. She brought the napkins and it took like three of them to clean it up, and now my hand were kinda messy, then I handed her the dirty napkins, of which she didn't look too happy about. What else was I supposed to do with them?? Then when the girl brought out my smoothie, when she was handing it to me it was tilted and it leaked all over my hand, legs, leather seat and car door. Luckily I had leather seats that could wipe& I was wearing shorts cause I much rather it got all over my legs than if I was wearing pants because I had a lot of errands to run that day and didn't want to walk around with stained pants. I was pretty upset about all that at this point. I asked to speak to the manager and he didn't do much but apologize. I wasn't wanting anything for free, but I got a clear feeling that he didn't care. But, the food was good so I let it go and returned. 2. Hostess fiasco: I haven't seen my mom in a while and it was the first time she'd visited me since moving to SD in 09. Well the hostess asked us if we wanted outside or inside. We said whichever was faster. So when we got called, it was to a table outside. It was a chilly night out so they had the heaters on outside, however the table we were at didn't feel heated at all, and my whole family thought so too. The hostess seating us could clearly hear us talking about how cold it was, but instead of offering to move us to another table, she was rushing to put down our menus so she could walk away, so right before she left I asked her ""Excuse me, can we please move to a table that's a little warmer? It's really cold here."" And looking annoyed, she said ""okay, you guys can come and wait at the host stand until something opens up."" So I said, ""well can't we just wait here? There's a table right there next to the heat lamp, can we just wait for that to get cleaned up?"" And she says looking further annoyed, ""Well, I have to check with the host stand first, because someone else might be waiting for that table. I'll be right back."" So we sat there for couple of minutes, then the server came by and said ""hello, what can I get started for you today?"" We said ""we're waiting for another table, it's too cold here, like that table."" And politely he said, of course! So he cleaned it off and helped us move over. Now I was concerned because the hostess hadn't come back in about 5 minutes. But I knew that she would be okay if another guest came cause our cold table was open. She never returned, an entirely different hostess came and looked really confused because the tables were switched. Needless to say the people sat at that table looked cold the whole time.  3. Curbside poor food quality: Now I always order the exact same thing. This time they got the sauce right, but all the food tasted like burnt plastic. I was so bummed, because I was so hungry but the food was so bad I couldn't even eat it. Also, I was quoted 20-25 min, and it took about 40 minutes. I called the manager the next day and he gave me a refund. That was nice of him.  4. Curbside, never again!: So before catching a movie, the fiance and I were ordering take-out. I order my usual with extra sauce, the bread (asking for dark bread only), asked for extra napkins/utensils and two complementary waters. When the girl arrives I checked the order. No extra sauce, the bread was brown AND white, just 3 napkins (which is the usual), and no waters. So I politely say ""I didn't get the extra sauce, can I please have some. And can I please have the waters, more brown bread and extra napkins."" Then she said, ""The extra sauce wasn't in the container?"" I politely said ""no, I just checked."" Then she asks, ""You want a water?"" And I replied ""I ordered two waters."" So promptly, she brought out the two waters, bread and sauce. So my fiancé and I sit down to eat and I opened the bag with the sauce in it, and it's spilled everywhere! The sauce was all over the bag, and the bread, and now all over my hands and it dripped on my clothes. I was pissed. My fiancé went all the way back and got some more sauce and bread for me.  About 50% of the times I go, something awful happens here. No longer a regular.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=140,3.68,3.25,3.172,2.44,3.422

She doesn't have a Cheesecake Factory where she currently lives and she wanted to eat here. So we went in and asked how long the wait and was told we could be seated right away. We were seated in the ""bar"" area. We had to wait 10 minutes before our server, Brian, came and introduced himself and took our drink order. It was another 5-7 minutes before our sodas arrived delivered by another server. In the 17 or so minutes we were there the two tables on either side of us were empty, seated and then they had received their drinks AND bread basket. I had to flag another server to get a bread basket and it was brought right away..piping hot..yea. We waiting a few more minutes and Brian returned took our order and dissapeared. In the meantime, the tables to the left and right of us had received their food orders.  After about 25 minutes I went to the hostess and requested a manager. About 3 minutes later Sean, who said he was the manager to came to the table. I explained the situation and stated that we had been waiting over 30 minutes for our food.  He said he would go to the kitchen and check on the status and would return. He left and returned about 5 minutes later.  He said that out food order had been placed 17 minutes earlier and that the one dish needed 20 minutes to prepare.  He said he would look at the ticket and see what could be done for compensation due to the circumstances.   And gave us a new server. She was super. I was disappointed when our food arrived. It wasn't as hot as it should have been given that it was supposed to have been prepared on the fly. When it came to the bill, all that was combed was a $6.95 piece of cheesecake.   I expected the meal to be better. I should have been combed the entire meal since it took 45 minutes to arrive to the table and the other inconveniences.  However, I ended up paying $40 for a less than mediocre meal and less than any service.  We never saw Brian except to carry a tray with bread baskets from one computer station to another after our complaint.  Shame on you Cheesecake Factory.  I won't be returning...ever and neither will my family or friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=420,3.04,3.12,3.1,2.308,3.0880000000000005

82,Ashley E.,"San Diego, CA",53,455,2887.0,3.0,2017-07-31,"I've only visited a few times and to be honest I really only come once a year when the cheesecake is half off.   The portions size is very large but with that you can expect a larger price.  Unfortunately the quality and the taste do not support that price.  I've had pasta, pizza, salad, and recently the waffle benedict off their brunch menu.  My favorite item out of all of it is the free bread and butter.  The salad I've had was basically plain lettuce, it didn't have anything else but an OK dressing.  I wouldn't order again.  The pizzas are actually okay and might be worth the price.  The kids meal pizza is a good deal and my son loves it.  The waffle benedict I had was not very good.  The eggs were not cooked the same.  One was a firm gel consistency while the other was barely cooked.  The yolk spilled out instantly and the whites were barely cooked.  The hollandaise which is one of my favorite things was lacking in flavor.  The chicken was just okay but too was lacking flavor. The waffle was the only decent part.  The potatoes served with it were cut potatoes that were deep fried and they were way over cooked.  They were hard and pretty much inedible. Service is also nothing special.  This last time was the worst. The servers are not attentive with refills of drinks.  Our server took our order and then went to three other tables and took their orders. She then must have put the order in the computer reversed and because we got our food last and was over a half hour later.  Also when it came time to pay I received the wrong bill and guess what it was more expensive then my bill.  Seriously these waiters need to be trained.  Not one server even asked how my meal was.  It was very disappointing service.  The only reason I would give the Cheesecake Factory three stars versus two is the cheesecake.  I have tried the salted caramel, the 30th anniversary last year, the white chocolate macadamia, raspberry lemon, red velvet and heath.  I've loved everyone of those.  The only one I didn't care for was this year's celebration cake.  It was a little odd by my four year old loved it.

The food was always good and service was great too until they started promoting their national cheesecake day. They told us that on National Cheesecake day all Cheesecake was half off. They didn't tell us that it was just one per person. I go their to get my girlfriend 5 slices and after waiting for over 30 minutes they told me it's only for one slice.

195,LeChonne W.,"La Mesa, CA",112,71,206.0,1.0,2017-08-07,"I thought I had reviewed them a while back but perhaps not. It was Jan 1 and a friend and I had gone in. The entire experience was bad from start to finish. The customer service (waiter claimed to be new) was atrocious and the food was really bad this day. Long story short the manager on duty came over and eventually it was settled...for the bad experience he was sending us gift cards. I had no huge inclination to return but because I had the gift card I decided to go spend it. Another friend and I dined here this past weekend. I wish I could say it was a great time. I cannot understand how people love the food here now that I have been back. Maybe it was good at some point, maybe each time it is what I order (which doesn't account totally for the bad service) but this place is not good. The young wait staff we got seemed a bit attitudal to me. Her comments back to me in the beginning of the ordering process was not CS worthy but I went with it...let it be what it was and in the end she turned out eh, ok. The food however was not good. I ordered the  LARGE shrimp and pasta. Shrimp wasn't large and the pasta was flavorless. I had to order extra sauce to make it decent. My friend ordered the Jambalaya with chicken and shrimp and only got the chicken. Whaaaaaat! How you just forget a entire protein? She did say that the taste was good (she salt and peppered it though). Once requested, they did give her the shrimp she should have gotten and she added it to her TO GO box. Next table over, I noticed that the same ""new waiter"" that caused the big issues back in Jan for me and another friend was working the table next to ours. He hadn't improved one bit. The couple ended up in the same situation. The HE got his food and was eating it. The SHE did not get her food until WELL after the HE got his food, he ate it all, the plate was removed and then she got her food. I felt really sad for them. Who wants to go out to eat with someone and not actually get to EAT with them. I heard that same waiter making the same excuses he had made with me and my friend at the beginning of the year to these folks. He obviously did not learn a thing in 8 months.   2 other things to note:  1. The cocktails on their menu do not show a price. You list pricing with wine but not with cocktails. When I asked our waiter about it, she was like they range from 7 to 13 dollars and it is obviously a surprise or a secret until you order. It seems a bit shady that they do not list the cost of their cocktails. Spirit is one of the things that seems like it would be easy to price in a restaurant. My wait person got an attitude when I asked her how much the cocktails were.   2. It was a birthday celebration is why I decided to go and use the gift card. I didn't want desert but my birthday friend, accepted the birthday dessert which you would think at the CHEESE CAKE FACTORY it would be a small cut of cheese cake. Nope!, it is the tiniest cup of generic ice cream you can imagine. So small in fact, I wonder why they bother. So cheap with themselves that they do not even offer their name sake signature item as a reward or gift for dinning there on your special day. I personally will never bother to return to the CCF again for all these reasons and a few more I am not going to go into cause why....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=140,2.88,3.08,3.104,2.18,3.0000000000000004

She truly left an amazing impression with her impeccable service and her positive, bubbly attitude. Okay, woman crush aside, the food. The food was really really good today. My mom and I ordered the calamari - it was seasoned perfectly, the calamari itself wasn't overlooked or anything. It was perfectly fried and at a perfect temperature. I have trust issues with calamari as it can be overseasoned, too battered and too fried, but today was excellent. The Louisiana Chicken Pasta. Delicious- hot, crispy breaded chicken with a right amount of heat. Even the thickness of the sauce was on par, as sometimes it's either too dry or too watery. I am thoroughly impressed. I haven't been to the Cheesecake factory since my spring vacation to Honolulu (you can read about my odd experience from that Cheesecake Factory).

My experience today at the cheesecake factory in Fashion Valley deserves that rating many times over due to the server(Patrick).  I came here for lunch after 1:00 when it was relatively quiet. It took a long time for my server to come to the table and the rest of the time I practically had to beg for any service, including having my ice tea refilled 2-3 times. When I ordered my sandwich with sourdough bread. he had a ""can't do attitude"" but then told me I could have it on a sourdough baguette. He then went to another table after taking my order and chatted them up for at least five minutes before putting my order in. I know because I watched him. When he came by I asked him if he had put my order in before talking at length with the other table. Defensively, he said that he knew his job and acted very cavalier.  He did this over and over, keeping his tables waiting much longer than expected. I don't mind a server talking to his customers, but not at length or at the expense of the other people waiting for reasonable service. He just seemed unable or inexperienced in how to manage his time well. That's one thing but then to act as though he was in the right was very offensive. When my sandwich finally arrived it was not on the sourdough baguette. I was not going to risk another unpleasant interchange with him or wait any longer to have the order corrected.

And when I say bland, I mean the cheesecake portion of the actual cheesecake...the cream cheese, when I put it in my mouth it was as if it was tasteless. You want to tell me that I paid what, 10 bucks per slice, to taste nothing? What a joke.  What are you trying to do, water down the cream? That's so irresponsible. People pay good money for this! Why would you allow something so nasty leave  your kitchen? I let 3 people try it, I didn't say anything...guess what? They all spit it back up asking what the f*ck was that? So now I'm stuck asking you? Postmates will not refund the order, so basically you just swindled me out of my money....? Great! Awesome.

It was a very large portion and flavorful. Spaghetti noodles were on point. Mushrooms and shrimps OH MY! The Shrimp Scampi seemed like the smallest portion of everything! Lol it is the perfect dish if you love jumbo shrimp and dislike pasta. Angel hair pasta in a nice and creamy garlicky buttery sauce and surrounded by 6! Jumboish Shrimps.  The Cajun Jambalaya Pasta is my first time ever eating Jambalaya with a pasta. It's a bit tomatoey.

There was a 45+ minute wait for a table, which included waiting outside awkwardly, and uncomfortably due to the location of this restaurant on a corner next to incoming mall traffic, and not enough adequate waiting area for all the guests. Once we were seated, and had ordered there was another 45+ minute wait to get our food. To top that off, while we were waiting for our order the table next to us, who were seated after we had placed our order, received their food before our table did, long before. Ours took so long that a manager came by and apologized for the delay, which was nice. But the final slap in the face was when we finally got our food, it was incorrect. I do not mean cooked to the wrong temperature. The asparagus that was supposed to accompany my steak and potatoes was just not given to me. We were in San Diego for vacation and had to leave or we would be late for our after dinner plans so i spoke with a manager about the situation. He apologized profusely and offered to mail me a $20 gift card in the hopes that i could have a better experience upon a return trip.

48,Kristine T.,"San Diego, CA",83,604,433.0,4.0,2017-09-17,"So my husband and I came here a week or so ago. We go to Cheesecake Factory all the time but this previous time was the worst. I have never walked out of a restaurant before but we did due to the service. It took over an hour and a half for our food to come out and we would have been fine if our waiter had checked in and kept us updated on the status but unfortunately, he avoided us! Not accidentally but blatantly avoided us. We would make eye contact and we were try and wave him down but he walked the opposite direction. We did speak to the manager Medi, who was very understanding and offered us some cheesecake or a meal on his next time we came. So a week or so later, we came back yesterday back because my mom chose it for her birthday dinner.  SERVICE - We asked for Medi and he remembered us. I have to say, Medi is a perfect example of a caring and kind manager. Someone who truly shows he cares about his patrons. He really apologized for our past experience and asked us how we were doing with our current experience. You could tell he was very genuine and wanted to ensure our experience was absolutely perfect this time around. Our server was TJ, who was awesome! He was witty and funny. He was fast and made sure we were taken care of. Even filled up our water before we asked. If you happen to have the pleasure of having TJ as your waiter, ask him to sing J Biebs and do a dance!!  FOOD Chinese Chicken Salad - Always our go to salad because it is so fresh with so much flavor. I always love the little tangerines in it giving it a juicy bite.  Louisiana Chicken Pasta - The fried chicken was very bland and dry. It was thin pieces of chicken so it could easily be over cooked which it was. The pasta noodles and sauce were just okay.  Honey Truffle Chicken - The chicken was well breaded and very moist! It had a very light taste of honey though. I wanted more flavor because the honey was too faint.  Fried Shrimp Basket - This was a solid dish. The shrimp was nicely fried without being overly greasy. The fries were perfectly crisp and salted.  Jamaican Black Pepper Chicken & Shrimp - This dish was slightly on the salty end this time around. My parents typically get this dish but it was saltier that usual. The white rice was very dry as well.  When it came time for the bill, it turned out Medi took care of our entire meal (including my parents and brother). We were not expecting that at all! We were taken by surprise but were also very appreciative. He even took the time to come out before we left to check if everything went well and said happy birthday to my mom. What a stand up guy!  Overall, Cheesecake Factory typically has good food! This time, it was just mediocre but I feel like it's not a normal occurrence.  3 STARS FOR FOOD 5 STARS FOR SERVICE",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego,2.56,3.08,3.008,2.768,2.8720000000000003

I swear if they sold this dipping sauce in the store I would buy gallons and put it on everything.  Next I moved on to the crab and artichoke dip which was rich, creamy and amazingly full of crap meat. The chicken sliders were juicy tender and came with lettuce, tomatoes and pickles.

Wether it's for a birthday dinner, company meeting or if it's your fav spot most have been and have seen the menu... So I haven't been in many years as I was never a huge fan of their food. Visited the other evening for a bday and all I can say is that the menu is overwhelming! Not necessarily a good things as has you wondering how much of the product is truly fresh vs processed food? 2 pages of cheesecakes, 2-3 pages for apps/small bites, 2-3 pages of entrees yet only a small portion set aside for fresh items like salads or soups. This is from memory but  there were more pages that I can't recall. Most people  in  our group were nauseated​ by the amount of items. To be honest only found a small amount of items I would have grabbed(really only 2) but settled on the chicken wraps as I hoped they would be fresh enough for my taste. Butter lettuce, pickled cucumber(sweet though), carrots, 3 sauces(all sickly sweet), chicken(felt processed and was on top of it, sweet), bean sprouts, rice noodles and some cilantro. Price point was fine but with all the sugar loaded into the meal felt like dessert instead of savory. Other party members bout some food but all the plates were huge! One pasta dish looked as if it was a whole box of pasta on a plate! Not even exaggerating as she only managed to eat a 3rd of her plate before she was done. Customer service was good so I give them that, attentive and since we were a large party compromised of different groups the waitress knew we would all ask for separate checks and easily accommodated. All the cheesecakes listed, maybe 1 or 2 seemed appetizing but in the end since the app was so sweet didn't order any. My taste buds were still coated with sweetness from the app so no need for it. We stayed well past closing but were not rushed out, seated outside enjoying good company was a blast and why I'm rating them a 3. Food was not great but service was good so can't say anything too bad other then they need to minimize their menu and focus on fresher options to combat the multitude of sweetness they're putting out there. May come back for some of the drinks as they had a few that were very good.

Also the strawberry jam with Monte Cristo is very good, 5. The Bad: the Monte Cristo (only avail. on weekend brunch, so we had to wait until I had a weekend off) was served with cold eggs and soggy French toast, like it had sat out for 15-20 minutes before coming to our table. One bite and I couldn't believe it; I waited a long time for this and it had been so good on past visits. I just asked if I took out the eggs if they could bring a hot replacement, they did, so all was OK there. They brought a very large portion of eggs too. They tried, so 3.5 - 4. When placing the order I had asked if we could swap out the ham for a veggie, and they brought a large plate of spinach. It was good except there were two pieces that were obviously black and rotten. ???  2.

70,Andrea H.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",6,3,3.0,1.0,2017-11-04,"Worst experience I've had at this chain. My party was a total of 15 people and were told we couldn't get a reservation. So we got there at 6:30pm and was told it would be a 2 hour wait. By 8:30pm, we still had not been called and the host said they were waiting on 2 parties to leave to get our table ready. 9pm and still not seated. 9:30 and one party of 3 was still there preventing them to move our tables together.  That party was already done eating and bill paid. They were just chatting. I didn't expect them to kick them out or anything but asked the manager why couldn't he ask them to move to a different table if they still want to stay and chat. He said, ""I don't want to ruin their experience"". So our party was split into 3 tables surrounding this group who didn't look like they were leaving anytime soon. We got seated at 9:45pm, over 3 hours from when we got there! Most of us were hangry by that point.  I had to talk over the table to ask my friend a question and the server told me ""don't talk over the table"". So I couldn't talk to people in my party? Then right before we were about to order, one of the ladies in the party of 3 (who was sitting next to me) takes off her shoes and socks and starts massaging her feet! Who does that in a public restaurant? This really disgusted me! Two people in our party got the same dish and the noodles in the pasta were hard! They offered to comp those two dishes as a solution.  When they first sat us down the manager had apologized to us for the long wait and offered to comp us some cheesecake. We thought great we could all get some cheesecake for dessert at least. When dessert time came, turns out he could only offer us 3 SLICES of cake. 3 slices for a party of 15? That's crazy.  I understand that this situation was out of their control but they could have handled it better and their apologies didn't seem sincere. I have seen people being asked to move to a different table to make room for a bigger party and they didn't even bother to take that suggestion.  They kept repeating, ""we don't want to ruin their experience or yours"". But honestly, they were so worried about ruining an experience of 3 people that they ended up ruining an experience of 15 people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=20,3.0,3.03,2.988,2.2760000000000002,3.018

She had to fix bill to add our deserts on it. My son who was eating was telling her to not take plate away to box up (as he was chewing) because he was still eating. Kind of rude taking food away from a child eating. Food portions are small and are hit and miss. My son's food looked good, mine was gross. My side salad was literally just lettus no tomatoes or anything. The chicken blt my sandwich was on was made with plain wheat bread. Ordered a lemon drop had no taste of alcohol in it.

If Chili's and BJ's is 5/10 quality Cheesecake Factory is an 8/10 and the prices are only 5-10% more. Value value value. You can ball on a budget at the Cheesecake Factory. 2. Their protein-oriented combo meals are an INSANE value. Choose from Steak Diane / Herb Salmon / Shrimp Scampi / Chicken Madera. served with mashed potatoes and some great sauces. $22.50 as of Q4 2017. 3. Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake.

43,Audra H.,"San Diego, CA",66,234,361.0,2.0,2017-12-20,"Blah. We wanted to enjoy this experience. We really did.  Upon arrival, I went to the front reservation desk and spoke with the hostess. I said, ""table for two"" and she replied ""15-20 minutes,"" and handed me a device that would light up/vibrate when the Table was ready.  My wife arrived shortly after parking the car. 20 minutes pass. My wife suggests we ask about time. We saw other people getting seated and we knew the 20 minute timeframe had passed. So....I go up and ask about our reservation. One girl says, ""let me check,"" and touches the computer screen. The hostess sees the screen, taps it once and says, ""it'll be 5-10 more minutes."" Confused, I walk away. Later on i realize I think somehow the first girl messed up and never activated our device for the table...boo. 5-7 minutes later we were seated.  However, not before hearing a hostess pick on our last name. She showed it to the two other girls from earlier that I had asked about our reservation and then proceeded to laugh and ask them, ""how do you say this?!"" One girl, (the most competent of the bunch in the time we were waiting) repeats how to say our last name clear as day, and correctly. The other laughs and says something about the show ""Stranger Things,"" and proceeds to come over to us to show us to our seats. What a crappy way to start our dinner. Laughing about a customers name? Shameful!!  I wish I could saw it gets better, but it doesn't. My wife orders Chicken Parmesan Pizza Style from our server (who was kind enough, just very busy). I order pasta and meatballs. Content, we close our menus and wait. About 5 minutes later, our server comes up and says, ""we're out of the Chicken Parmesan Pizza Style in the Kitchen.""  Wow. Strange. Do they freeze their food or something? How can they be out of chicken, Parmesan, etc.?! Does it come in a frozen package or something and that's why they're out of it?! I mean, we're at an Italian restaurant. It was disappointing to say the least.  My wife ends up ordering Crusted Chicken Romano.  The pasta and meatballs I ordered was just alright. The meatballs had plenty of flavor, (but were kinda hard in places--maybe they sat to long in a warmer, oven?) pasta was luke warm and not hot. Not something to call home about.  I tried my wife's dish. The crusted chicken was decent but the pasta was flavorless and it had very little sauce so this contributed to the lack of flavor.  I've been here before and the food was average--AT BEST.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego,3.2,2.86,3.024,,2.9960000000000004

We usually order the fried zuchinni, the spinach and artichoke dip, calamari, fresh grilled salmon with lemon sauce and the pasta divinci. They've run out of the fried zuchinni 3 times and they've run out of the spinach dip once. The great part though is that they've never run out of both at the same time before..... I have never been able to finish my entree here. The food takes really long to come to the table, we usually finish a whole basket of bread and start on another before appetizers come out 25minutes sometimes 30 then about 30 minutes more for the entree. Usually by the time our entree comes to the table we will have a few bites and be sleepy already. I assumed it was because of the dim lighting? I've been to high end restaurants with mood lighting and I've never gotten sleepy at the restaurants before. We just take our leftovers Togo and my boyfriend eats them the next day.

There are so many other restaurants at Fashion Valley mall so just don't waste you precious time at this ridicules cheesecake factory location.  I'm way over disappointed with the bad experience I had.  We first came in at 8:15pm on MONDAY night. Asked for table for 6 (4 adults and 2 kids) told me to wait 10 minutes and will be sited, thought okay, 10 minutes it's ain't bad. Unfortunately the 10 came out to 20 minutes.  After we got sited it's took the waitress 5-7 just to come and even talked with us and than 5 more minutes to get some bread.  The silverware we've received were dirty I told that to the waitress he didn't even care about it. Asked for plastic utilities (which I didn't received; I needed to asked 3 times before I got it).  The waitress first took our order at 8:50pm. More than 30 minutes after we first came in!!  We ordered avocado egg rolls, 2 burgers, grilled salmon and edamame. Nothing complicated right? Lol. Not for cheesecake.  We waited more than 45(!!!!!!!!) minutes and even didn't receive all the dishes together.  First we received the grilled salmon, which was extremely salty and the mashed potatoes was COLD then after 3-5 minutes the two burger came out with NO fries, the fries came out only after 10 minutes. After we finished the burger.  But even after an hour the avocado egg rolls didn't arrived. We saw 2 other tables around us getting avocado egg rolls but for our table, nothing.  After asking the waitress couple of times about the egg rolls he didn't know what to say and just called a manager.  The manager also said he doesn't know and he will check this situation.  After 10 minutes came back said they run out from the egg rolls and he's sorry about it. Lol. 2 other tables (that set after us) received avocado egg rolls.  The reason we came to the cheesecake was because the avocado egg rolls and a cheesecake.  The waitress didn't inform us they doesn't have avocado egg rolls, the manager said they run out of it. I literally saw 2 other tables with the same dish at the table.  So the manager is a liar! He thought that if he will take if some $10 burger from the bill all will be okay. I didn't complained because I wanted my money back. My time with my dear family means the world to me. Because of the Cheesecake Factory this evening was ruined and we left without even having a desserts.  BTW dear manager, the $10 you took off I added to the tip so you can see it wasn't about the money.
