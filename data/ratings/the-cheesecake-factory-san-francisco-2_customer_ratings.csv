I would never come here myself because I think the wait is ridiculous and the food is not worth the wait. I went on a Thursday night and the wait time was 2 hours...  The food here is what is expected of a Cheesecake Factory. The basically serve everything you can think of and their ""special"" is about 2 pages long. Not a good place for those who are indecisive. The portion is extremely large and can get two average people. The food overall is good but not great and I do not think it is ever worth the wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=1220,2.92,3.24,3.388,2.732,3.1120000000000005
647,Adam F.,"Las Vegas, NV",20,9,,3.0,2012-01-03,"I really like this place a lot and like to meet up with friends here every time I'm in San Francisco. In the warmer months it's nice to sit on the patio which overlooks Union Square, one of my favorite places in San Francisco to kill time or just hang out. The menu is absolutely GINORMOUS; if you're not careful you could easily get caught up for 30 minutes just figuring our what you want to order. In the cooler months I like sitting at their bar, having a few strong cocktails and people watching. No matter who your bartender is they consistently make a pretty mean mojito, one of my go to favorites. So why only three stars? It really is a three star restaurant by Yelp standards; this place is A-OK. The food is decent and they're a fast paced tourist trap. I've never had a dish here that blows my mind, but I've never had a bad plate of food either. The servers are always a little rushed, which is to be expected, but never rude and I almost never have to ask for anything twice or water refills. Bottom line; great place to hang out and have some food and drinks, especially compared to the pricier options in the Union Square area, which offer a far superior product with a price point to match.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=1460,3.08,3.22,3.392,2.732,3.1640000000000006

I had the Caesar salad with chicken, it was really yummy and the dressing was light (3.5 stars). I also had the chicken salad sandwich; didn't like it too much.

2521,Jael K.,"La Jolla, United States",0,5,,2.0,2012-01-04,"So I just went to this place with my boyfriend. They told us the wait was gonna be 35 to 40 minutes, but it turned out to be only 20. For a sunny Sunday afternoon, that was pretty good I would think.  We were seated on the outside patio, which is super nice and has a great view. The bf ordered fresh strawberry cheesecake - yummie. I had the chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake, which I usually get, and which was as good as ever. Unfortunately, that's all the positive things I can say about this place. Service was HORRIBLE. From what I've read on here, maybe it's because we're both students. Anyways, we were treated like two 13-year-olds who had no business being in this place. Only we're both in our twenties. Unlike everyone else, we did not get any complimentary bread and butter. Our waitress did not even bother to say ""there you go"" or ""you're welcome"" or ""enjoy"" anything the like. We had to repeatedly ask for refills - they never once just gave us one (in fact, I never even got a refill on my water; but even my bf, who paid for his coke, had to be really persistent). Then they brought us our check when we hadn't even finished half our cheesecakes, which I thought was pretty rude. And it's not like we were taking our sweet-ass time. It was more like they were trying to get rid of us asap. Meanwhile, everyone else around us was treated friendly. Nah, not going back there. If it weren't for the nice patio and the yummie cheesecake (which of course is the same as in every other CF), I'd have given 1 star.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=2040,3.12,3.19,3.388,2.6000000000000005,3.162

1599,Andrew A.,"San Francisco, United States",113,35,,4.0,2012-01-05,"Awesome food at an even better price. Just make sure you eat before you get on the wait list.  I've literally put my name down on the list just to go back to Union Square for happy hour at a nearby restaurant. After loading up on drinks and appetizers, we proceeded back to Westfield to kill some time. After we finished walking around, we went back to Macys to walk around some more. We were finally seated after a two hour wait. We started off with several appetizers including the Hot Spinach Cheese Dip, Fire-Roasted Artichoke, Thai Lettuce Wraps, and Spicy Ahi Tempura Roll. The Fire-Roasted Artichoke put the Hot Spinach Cheese Dip to shame, but both were pleasant. I don't know why we ordered two sets of chips and dips.The Thai Lettuce wrap was too complex for a brute like me. I refuse to pay for a meal just to make it myself. The Spicy Ahi was winner of the appetizers though. I honestly didn't expect it to be that great, but it was and more. Flipping through the menu, I noticed ""We use premium Certified Angus Beef®or American Style Kobe for all of Our Burgers"". I asked the waiter is it REAL Kobe beef? He told me yes. For $13.95, I absolutely refused to believe it was. After going back and fourth and questioning my waiter's integrity and morals, I decided I had no grounds to judge whether it was real Kobe beef or not seeing how I've never tried it. So I ordered it! My KOBE burger came and the moment of truth was in my fingertips. It wasn't Kobe beef. But don't get me wrong, it was still a solid grade A burger with some of the best fries around. But at the end of the day, it was still just regular beef. We didn't order cheesecake because a total of 7 appetizers, multiple rounds of drinks, salad/soup, and an entree was more than enough to satisfy four people (gluttony will be the death of us). The bill came out to be around 140$ between four people ordering a feast fit for a king. Not bad. Overall a good choice for a meal if you have some time on your hands. Definitely on the Must Do List when going down town for the first time.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=1200,3.32,3.21,3.396,2.7039999999999997,3.254

703,Ashley P.,"San Jose, CA",132,23,4.0,5.0,2012-01-07,"I've never had The Cheesecake Factory before this because I was determined to try this location first. I grew up in Fremont and during High School and my friends and I would try and go every time we were in San Francisco but the wait was always just too long. I tried to go again while visiting the city during my college years and alas the wait was too long for us. Finally six years after my first attempt to dine here I finally came here with my boyfriend and his mom during a lunch on a random Tuesday afternoon. SUCCESS!! The view was amazing and we got to sit near the window (not outside because it was too cold). Our waiter was awesome and even hooked us up with some very delicious ""hot sauce"" but I think it was just chili sauce used for their ahi salad or something. I had the Crusted Romano Chicken with Alfredo pasta. SO DELICIOUS!!! I'm wanting to go back soon just for that! My boyfriend got the jambalaya pasta which was good but definitely does not beat his mother's jambalaya. His mom got the orange chicken which was good too. I liked that the portions were huge but I wish their bread basket had some better breads in it, they were too tough for my liking. OOO and I got the red velvet cheesecake which was SO AMAZING! I'm a red velvet girl for sure and it was everything I wanted and more! My boyfriend got the snickers cheesecake and I do not know how it tasted myself because he devoured it before I even got a chance to try a bit, I think he liked it.

4417,Elena A.,"San Francisco, United States",79,41,309.0,5.0,2012-01-07,"I 1st came to this Cheesecake Factory location in (2007) with my boy friend. I heard so many good things about it, I was just dying to try it out. My employee's would always brag about it. So, I got him to take me there. That visit was all I imagined & more. So, I recently rounded up my friends back in February of this year & off we went.  It is always quite a long wait. So, be prepared. If you don't have ant patience you better venture else where.  Now this, Cheesecake factory just happens to be located in Macy's Union square you catch the elevator & up you go to the floor with amazing food & ambiance. I love the interior of this place it's like a formal but contemporary. The lighting is dim to set a romantic tone. It is just gorgeous on the inside makes yo feel like your really somewhere special. You also have the option of outdoor seating & heated outdoor seating at that. As they have torches or heating lamps set up. The view is amazing as your over looking union square, sky scrapers & the outdoor ice skating rink. My friends & I took this seating option. Now, on to my favorite part the food. I had the Shrimp Scampi and Steak Diane:mouth watering  Shrimp Scampi sautéed in buttery garlic white wine sauce,  sprinkled in basil and tomato. The steak Diane is something to talk about juicy Angus Beef Steak cooked to perfection  covered with black peppercorns smothered  in a  rich mushroom wine sauce with a side of wonderful  garlic mashed potatoes. This honestly has to be the very best steak I've had in a while & I have not came across a steak as good since unfortunately. This whole meal was worth every last dime. I'm yearning for it as we speak.  Now let's get down to the Cheesecake part of the Cheesecake factory as that is what they are known for. I had the over the top  Hershey's Chocolate Bar Cheesecake. Let me tell you what this bad boy consist of: velvety Hershey's Cheesecake along with soft luscious Chocolate Cake. It is oh so moist. That's not all its  topped with Creamy Chocolate Frosting with a whole wall of Chocolate Chips. Oh, this is it for any chocolate lover. It is rich but not over bearing. It's heaven in every bite. Not only is it delicious but it  is a work of art. It is almost too pretty to eat. My boy friend doesn't even like sweets & he loved there cheese cake & that says a lot. I love them I must come back soon. There food is calling me! -Elena ;)",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=760,3.4,3.25,3.412,2.612,3.31
974,Elaine W.,"San Francisco, CA",142,324,139.0,3.0,2012-01-08,"In the handful of times I've gone here with coworkers, friends, family...our experiences are always 50/50. The cheesecakes alone deserve 5 stars (my fave is the red velvet), service is a 3 on a good day, and the rest of the menu can range from 1 to 4. On our last visit, we went for Sunday brunch round 11am. Got two salmon platters, a coffee, and a mint sweet tea. The salmon platter was very well presented...smoked salmon slices, greens, tomatoes & onion, a scoop of cream cheese and a bagel. Everything was good except for the bagel which was not toasted and was rock hard/stale. We ended up asked for a basket of their complimentary sourdough and oat bread instead. The coffee was extremely watered down...evidenced in the glass cup it was served in - it looked more like tea than coffee. The mint tea was refreshing...I'm thinking of opting out of the sweetener next time cause it was too syrupy. Free refills were offered on both drinks...I thought it funny that the coffee was the same price as the mint tea $3.25...that's more like the price of a latte! On future visits I will skip the coffees and simple beverages and go for the mimosas and other cocktails. Also, if you dine here during the day, unless it's windy out, definitely opt for outside seating where you can get a great view of Union Square.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=2180,3.36,3.24,3.408,2.348,3.2880000000000007
547,Patrick V.,"San Diego, CA",20,49,84.0,3.0,2012-01-09,"This particular Cheesecake Factory is located on the top floor of Macy's across from Union Square.  Seating options are indoor and outdoor.  There is usually a bit of a wait for a table depending on the time, you can call in advance to reserve.  Otherwise, you could end up waiting anywhere from 10-20 minutes. I personally prefer to sit indoors due to my paranoia of birds and bird droppings.  If the normally overcast sky of San Francisco is clear, this is a good outdoor dining area that will also give you a good view of the city. The food quality is pretty good.  Good ingredients, prepared well.  The style of food here is varied but does not stray too far from classic recipes.  There are traditional American dishes on the menu like Burgers, Meatloaf, Rotisserie Chicken, etc things that you would expect to see on a 'chain restaurant' menu but you will also see things like Fish Taco's,  Orange Chicken and Sheppards Pie on the menu.  The portions are HUGE!  I'm talking fat American size portions.  They do offer something they call ""lunch size"" portions on some of the dishes but most of them are way too big to finish in one sitting.  They have a full bar on one side of the restaurant. Prices are reasonable considering the amount of food.  I've never made it to desert which is a shame because their cheescakes and deserts look really good. Bathroom was clean and well kept!  Trust me, thats important.  You can tell a lot about a restaurant by seeing how well their bathroom is kept.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=1320,3.32,3.23,3.412,2.348,3.266

I've only been to a Cheesecake Factory once before and I remember thinking that my experience was average (food wise). This time wasn't that different.  This branch is a lot busier than others simply because it's located in downtown San Francisco.The wait was about 30 minutes but we just went downstairs to look at the furniture. Be wary of wandering out of the restaurant floor because the little machine they give you while you wait might not receive the signal to alert you. There were three of us: me, my brother, and my sister-in-law. We eat a lot, so we ordered a lot. We got stuffed mushrooms and fried mac n cheese balls for appetizer, we each got huge dishes for meals (I ordered the tomato basil pasta), and two of us each got cheesecake slices.  The appetizers were okay. The stuffed mushrooms were not to my liking (small and not really stuffed) and the fried mac n cheese was too salty for my taste like the last time I had it. My pasta was very bland. The ahi tuna salad thing my sister-in-law got was boring without the tuna. The mushroom swiss burger my brother got was good but not memorable. Pretty average. The cheesecakes were good. My brother got the chocolate coconut cream and I got pumpkin pecan. His was good but I felt like the coconut taste was artificial. My pumpkin pecan was good.  I would recommend...it's just a very heavy cheesecake. All cheesecakes there are heavy.  Overall, food was whatever. I don't mind too much because I didn't pay for it at the time.

In other words, this is NOT the place to go if you and your friends just decided on the spot where to go and eat. To sum it up, this is what local high school students would think as being ""semi-fancy"" (since I used to be one of them). In terms of quality of food, it's not bad, but nothing to get exited about either.  As for being a Cheesecake Factory, fans of the food item can rejoice since they offer a WIDE variety of cheesecakes. However, they do tend to overload it with whipped cream. I'm not a huge cheesecake fan, but like the rest of the food they serve, it's worth your money....but is it worth the wait is another matter entirely. Around 5pm or before is probably the ideal time since they don't take reservations. Any later, they tend to get packed even on random days of the week. For the lucky, 30 minutes or less.

Friendly, but could be friendlier service. And good food :)  We walked in, to be told that there will be an hour wait for a table indoors. We really really really wanted to eat there so we said okay, we'll wait. Maybe pass time by walking around the city, yeah? But then they told us that if we wanted to sit outdoors, they had a table ready. So we accepted the table and went on our way.  The first thing I noticed while outside were the wonderful heaters to keep us warm :) I was so thankful for those. Had they not had them, we'd definitely be freezing.  We had about 15 mins to look through the menu, the waiter came around once to ask if we were ready to order. And no we were not, but some drinks would've been nice. This waiter did not ask if we would like anything to drink while waiting. Thumbs down.  My coworkers ordered the orange chicken, and pasta fettuccini. And I ordered the jambalaya pasta. Everyone was pretty satisfied with their food. Portions were huge so we had to pack some to go.  But right after! Another downside: my co worker found traces of food/soap residue on her glass for water. Disgusting. I'd hope they check their glasses before giving them out next time.  Dessert!! I had the ultimate red velvet cheesecake, my workers had the strawberry cheesecake, and the hershey cheesecake. One word: fantastic.  Overall pretty good visit. We had a good time.

And good food :)  We walked in, to be told that there will be an hour wait for a table indoors. We really really really wanted to eat there so we said okay, we'll wait. Maybe pass time by walking around the city, yeah? But then they told us that if we wanted to sit outdoors, they had a table ready. So we accepted the table and went on our way.  The first thing I noticed while outside were the wonderful heaters to keep us warm :) I was so thankful for those. Had they not had them, we'd definitely be freezing.  We had about 15 mins to look through the menu, the waiter came around once to ask if we were ready to order. And no we were not, but some drinks would've been nice. This waiter did not ask if we would like anything to drink while waiting. Thumbs down.  My coworkers ordered the orange chicken, and pasta fettuccini. And I ordered the jambalaya pasta. Everyone was pretty satisfied with their food. Portions were huge so we had to pack some to go.  But right after! Another downside: my co worker found traces of food/soap residue on her glass for water. Disgusting. I'd hope they check their glasses before giving them out next time.  Dessert!! I had the ultimate red velvet cheesecake, my workers had the strawberry cheesecake, and the hershey cheesecake. One word: fantastic.  Overall pretty good visit. We had a good time.

Located on the top floor of the Macy's Building, you can sit on the balcony and overlook the entire city. Simply gorgeous. Aside from that, it's a Cheesecake Factory like any other. The ambiance inside the restaurant is decadent. There are high ceilings and swanky decor bathed in yellow lights. Large pillars run from the floor to the ceiling; it feels very fancy. The restaurant is usually very crowded, and there's a lot of noise from all the patrons in the restaurant. Hard to get seated immediately unless you have a reservation. Service is okay, although there will be stretches of time when you don't see your server at all, even if your glass of water or basket of bread is empty. This is probably because there are so many patrons in the restaurant, all of whom keep the servers quite busy. The food is decent enough; I like the Cashew Chicken, especially, which is a nice spicy dish served with green onions and roasted cashews. The menu claims that it's a Mandarin dish, but I doubt that.

When we were finally seated the hostess tried to squeeze 6 adults in an area clearly designated for less people. It wasn't till a manager was summoned that the seating situation was rectified. My wife and I ordered the avocado rolls to start and those were fresh and quite tasty, so I began to feel a bit encouraged by this and thought we might have an enjoyable experience after all. I proceeded to order the blackened chicken sandwich, my wife ordered the shrimp fettuccine. When my sandwich arrived it was dry and tough, as if it had been microwaved and served quickly. My wife's dish was adequate, but nothing to write home about. My kids went with the safe bet and ordered burgers, which actually turned out ok. We then ordered desert and this was in fact the highlight of the whole experience as they did serve a great cheesecake. As it was I truly was not having a memorable experience, when one of the servers snapped at my daughter for asking him where the bathroom was.

During our meal, we needed a few things that took awhile to get but it was busy so we were understandable.. After the meal, our server said he would be going on break... And introduced us to a lady.. She brought us our check and that was it.. I paid with a credit card.. And she brought the bill back.. I signed and put zero tip... Cause I had $10 cash in my pocket.. So, I left that on the table and we got up to leave.. The meal was pretty good and overall service was the same.. And for only 3 people eating I thought $10 was plenty for a tip.. As we walked to the exit, the server that was supposably on a break chased me down and asked ""sir..sir.. How was your dinner?? Was everything ok??"" I simply said.. Yeah.. Food was ok.. Why?? He then gave me an odd look and walked away.. I was totally confused.. Why did he run up to me when we were leaving and ask??? As we started down the escalator the girl that had replaced the server walked right behind the server and said ""hey.. They left $10 on the table.. Cheap asssses""...

2769,Nick G.,"Stockton, CA",0,1,,1.0,2012-02-19,"Was in town with my wife and kids visiting my sister who lives by union square... I had been to cheesecake factory several times when I worked in SF.. So I decided to take my family.. It was a Saturday so I knew it would be busy.. But we decided to make reservations.. We got to our table pretty quick.. Our server was pretty nice in the beginning.. I asked him for some suggestions on my chicken plate.. He offered a few and everything was ordered for dinner.. During our meal, we needed a few things that took awhile to get but it was busy so we were understandable.. After the meal, our server said he would be going on break... And introduced us to a lady.. She brought us our check and that was it.. I paid with a credit card.. And she brought the bill back.. I signed and put zero tip... Cause I had $10 cash in my pocket.. So, I left that on the table and we got up to leave.. The meal was pretty good and overall service was the same.. And for only 3 people eating I thought $10 was plenty for a tip.. As we walked to the exit, the server that was supposably on a break chased me down and asked ""sir..sir.. How was your dinner?? Was everything ok??"" I simply said.. Yeah.. Food was ok.. Why?? He then gave me an odd look and walked away.. I was totally confused.. Why did he run up to me when we were leaving and ask??? As we started down the escalator the girl that had replaced the server walked right behind the server and said ""hey.. They left $10 on the table.. Cheap asssses""...

In the cooler months I like sitting at their bar, having a few strong cocktails and people watching. No matter who your bartender is they consistently make a pretty mean mojito, one of my go to favorites. So why only three stars? It really is a three star restaurant by Yelp standards; this place is A-OK. The food is decent and they're a fast paced tourist trap. I've never had a dish here that blows my mind, but I've never had a bad plate of food either. The servers are always a little rushed, which is to be expected, but never rude and I almost never have to ask for anything twice or water refills.

During lunch, their portions may not seem like a lot, but trust me it's HECKA FILLING. If you look hard enough, you don't have to kill your wallet for a good lunch. They do have that extra SF Health Charge thing going on but hey, it tastes good, you get good bread and butter, you get good service. You get to eat in a lively, clean, comfortable, fancy setting. What more could you possibly want?  If you are looking for a five star restaurant with a dress code, then get out of here. You gotta look somewhere else. This place is perfect for prom night, birthday dinner or even a casual lunch.  If you come here for dinner and it's a bit chilly outside, don't fear. That's why we have heat lamps invented. If you choose to eat outside, you can totally eat on the patio ish area where you get an amazing view of Union square. Here's a SF secret, come to the Cheesecake factory at night time during Christmas time, you get to see the tall bright tree. That's like a room with a view but a dinner with a view and a heat lamp. HOW COOL IS THAT? Here's another SFsecret, come during the chinese new year parade, you can watch the parade without the crowds and stinkbombs.  The icing on top would be that if you do choose to eat outside, you can have a candle lit on your table. SF can be pretty windy so if it is windy outside and you choose to have a candle on, it might go out in a few minutes.  I recommend all of my friends to come here when we have money and time.

It may seem like I'm ragging on this restaurant, but I have no real complaints.  I mean, it's just like any other chain restaurant: variety of food and drinks, nice decor, decent service, and solid food. But the experience of sitting out on the patio (if it's not that cold outside or if it is cold, and you can brave the cold) or even sitting next to the huge windows that look out into the patio makes the wait worth it! I know people often complain about the wait, but I think if you come here at like 6:00 on a weekday, you'll likely beat the dinner crowd and have your choice of tables. I would say this is definitely one of those places to take your out-of-town friends and family when they come visit the city. Not only is it in a really pretty part of town (next to the Tiffany's and Louis Vuitton stores), but there's a huge tourist draw. Imagine your friends saying: ""Yeah, [your name here] took me to the Cheesecake Factory in Union Square. It's right on the roof of Macys! Woah . . . it was such a cool experience.

I had the chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake, which I usually get, and which was as good as ever. Unfortunately, that's all the positive things I can say about this place. Service was HORRIBLE. From what I've read on here, maybe it's because we're both students. Anyways, we were treated like two 13-year-olds who had no business being in this place. Only we're both in our twenties. Unlike everyone else, we did not get any complimentary bread and butter. Our waitress did not even bother to say ""there you go"" or ""you're welcome"" or ""enjoy"" anything the like. We had to repeatedly ask for refills - they never once just gave us one (in fact, I never even got a refill on my water; but even my bf, who paid for his coke, had to be really persistent). Then they brought us our check when we hadn't even finished half our cheesecakes, which I thought was pretty rude. And it's not like we were taking our sweet-ass time. It was more like they were trying to get rid of us asap. Meanwhile, everyone else around us was treated friendly. Nah, not going back there.

4392,Rex X.,"Berkeley, United States",42,63,92.0,4.0,2012-04-08,"Half off cheesecake, what what?! Totally there! I invited along my international friend and the two of us set out for the Cheesecake Factory in Union Square. The line to get into the elevator was pretty long, so we had to wait a round before we got in. We arrived at the host counter around 6:15pm, and we were told that the wait would be 35 minutes. Not bad!  When we came back, our buzzer vibrated at 35 minutes on the dot, and we were seated outside. Both of us were starving, but we decided to share an appetizer and main dish because 1. I don't eat very much 2. we were told to expect large portions and 3. to save room for cheesecake. That ended up being the wisest decision of the night. We finished their complimentary bread (I prefer the darker ones, very nomnomie), gobbled down the appetizer (avocado rolls, absolutely heavenly), and by the time our main dish arrived we were forced to slow down else risk stomach explosion. My only gripe about our experience at the restaurant was that the servers seemed to be assigned to specific tables, and our particular server was especially busy juggling several tables inside and outside. Thus, when we needed anything, we had to wait until she was available to get her attention. There were literally four servers behind the staff area out on the patio all of 20 feet away from our table staring at us as we tried to signal for the check, and none of them moved. I can understand that the tip we leave won't go to them, but really?  We ordered a cheesecake slice to share (lemon raspberry) and I bought another (red velvet) for a friend. The cheesecake tasted amazing, but is very, very rich, and given the state of our stomachs, we had a very hard time finishing it. I ended up taking most of my slice home. The red velvet slice came in a box literally triple the size of the one that we had to pack away the lemon raspberry. My butthead of a friend decided to not come and claim it for a week, thus effectively occupying one shelf in my fridge for a good 6 days -____-. I obviously need new friends.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=800,3.56,3.22,3.192,3.504,3.3560000000000008

2774,Andrew A.,"San Francisco, CA",113,35,,4.0,2012-05-01,"Awesome food at an even better price. Just make sure you eat before you get on the wait list.  I've literally put my name down on the list just to go back to Union Square for happy hour at a nearby restaurant. After loading up on drinks and appetizers, we proceeded back to Westfield to kill some time. After we finished walking around, we went back to Macys to walk around some more. We were finally seated after a two hour wait. We started off with several appetizers including the Hot Spinach Cheese Dip, Fire-Roasted Artichoke, Thai Lettuce Wraps, and Spicy Ahi Tempura Roll. The Fire-Roasted Artichoke put the Hot Spinach Cheese Dip to shame, but both were pleasant. I don't know why we ordered two sets of chips and dips.The Thai Lettuce wrap was too complex for a brute like me. I refuse to pay for a meal just to make it myself. The Spicy Ahi was winner of the appetizers though. I honestly didn't expect it to be that great, but it was and more. Flipping through the menu, I noticed ""We use premium Certified Angus Beef®or American Style Kobe for all of Our Burgers"". I asked the waiter is it REAL Kobe beef? He told me yes. For $13.95, I absolutely refused to believe it was. After going back and fourth and questioning my waiter's integrity and morals, I decided I had no grounds to judge whether it was real Kobe beef or not seeing how I've never tried it. So I ordered it! My KOBE burger came and the moment of truth was in my fingertips. It wasn't Kobe beef. But don't get me wrong, it was still a solid grade A burger with some of the best fries around. But at the end of the day, it was still just regular beef. We didn't order cheesecake because a total of 7 appetizers, multiple rounds of drinks, salad/soup, and an entree was more than enough to satisfy four people (gluttony will be the death of us). The bill came out to be around 140$ between four people ordering a feast fit for a king. Not bad. Overall a good choice for a meal if you have some time on your hands. Definitely on the Must Do List when going down town for the first time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=1200,3.88,3.49,3.24,2.8640000000000003,3.6460000000000004

Other than the food, Cheesecake factory isn't really all that. When it isn't crowded it's awesome, but when there is a wait, it's absolutely dreadful! On top of that the service is definitely lacking. I've come here a million times and never have I had outstanding service.

The food is great but the customer service and attentiveness of the waiters/ waitresses is definitely lacking.  The few times I've been here I've been mistreated as a customer but still I continue to return. The manager is nice and understanding however the rest of the workers really need to get to par. Each time I eat here it always ends up being a three to four hour event. Waiting for a table takes about 45 minutes to 2 hours depending on the size of the group and time of day. After getting situated you wait another 20 minutes for them to take your order 15 minutes later they finally give you some bread and about a half an hour later (sometimes more) your food comes out. I can honestly say I have witnessed one of my WORST restaurant experiences here. Not because of the wait time but also for the way our waiter treated our group. In the end our waiter only came to our table twice and we got charged dinner menu price even though it was still lunch time. For some reason the busboys were serving us, other waiters, and no one ever checked up on us. I know this kind of service only happened to me once but other times I have been here the service has been similar and it was enough to break my patience and appreciativeness toward this restaurant.

4796,ibby m.,"San Francisco, United States",0,47,4.0,2.0,2012-06-07,"I don't like chain restaurants and only came here for dinner last night because we had a gift card. The long wait was expected. Once we sat down, a very professional server approached us and took our drink orders. She stated that our waiter is on break and that he will follow up with us shortly. Since we reviewed the menu while waiting, she also took our order. I ordered a mojito and she suggested a glass of water while waiting for my cocktail. That told me that the bar was backed up. I appreciated her suggestion. However, after 10 minutes, no water. She walked by our table a few minutes later and I asked her for the water. She said our regular server would be along with that. 15 minutes in and the water shows up with the cocktail. It's just water. I don't think anyone should wait that long for something so simple. We ordered two mushroom/onion/cheese burgers with side salads. I ordered medium ad hubs ordered med rare. Mine was ok, his was not med rare at all. Barely any pink. The mushroom and onions were so skimpy and there was only once slice of cheese when the menu said two slices. I mentioned the skimpy toppings to our server and he didn't offer to get more. He simply said that's the way it is. For a 1/4 lb  burger that was smaller than the bun with 6 pieces of mushrooms and 3 pieces of onion, I was shocked at the $11 price. I noticed the lady next to me also complain about her food. There was a missing ingredient as well. Oh I forgot, the mushrooms were Luke warm and the cheese was a bit cold. The other reason I'm giving a low rating is because our regular server barely communicated. No thank yous, no acknowledgments, nothing.  At the end, he only asked if we wanted dessert. Hell no. Not going to help your up selling when you can't help make your customers happy. We tipped 10% to reflect the minimal and skimpy service.

It's one of those places where you can pretty much order any type of food (burgers/pastas/chinese/mexican/sushi...) which is why it's so awesome :) Most recent visits: -Pastas: I've tried many different pastas they offer and my favorite would be the fettucini with chicken and sundried tomatoes.  The sundried tomatoes = the best! It really gives the whole dish a bang! -Burgers: New found love. Must get the smokehouse bbq burger! This is seriously a really good burger: bacon/onion rings/melted cheddar and the bbq ranch sauce yummm!!  -Blueberry cheesecake was really good too! My favorite part was the crust!!

I've celebrated many birthdays and occasions at Cheesecake Factory. My last experience at the one in SF however kind of let me down. We went here last sunday for an late lunch/early dinner. During our 2+hr dinner. Our server had changed 3 times-- it made it very confusing when we needed something. It also took extra long for our drinks and food to come out, probably because the server who took our order was different than the server bringing our food & the server who brought our food was different from the server who checked us out. It did not make for a smooth dinner.  The food is usually very pleasing. However his last time, the presentation lacked. My salad looked as though the greens weren't that fresh and someone did not put much effort to make it look... like something you'd want to eat. My fish came out the same way-- very sloppy and sad to look at.  Nonetheless, these reasons would not halt me from EVER coming back to the cheesecake factory-- afterall, I grew up eating here.

I grew up in Fremont and during High School and my friends and I would try and go every time we were in San Francisco but the wait was always just too long. I tried to go again while visiting the city during my college years and alas the wait was too long for us. Finally six years after my first attempt to dine here I finally came here with my boyfriend and his mom during a lunch on a random Tuesday afternoon. SUCCESS!! The view was amazing and we got to sit near the window (not outside because it was too cold). Our waiter was awesome and even hooked us up with some very delicious ""hot sauce"" but I think it was just chili sauce used for their ahi salad or something. I had the Crusted Romano Chicken with Alfredo pasta. SO DELICIOUS!!! I'm wanting to go back soon just for that! My boyfriend got the jambalaya pasta which was good but definitely does not beat his mother's jambalaya. His mom got the orange chicken which was good too. I liked that the portions were huge but I wish their bread basket had some better breads in it, they were too tough for my liking. OOO and I got the red velvet cheesecake which was SO AMAZING! I'm a red velvet girl for sure and it was everything I wanted and more!

I heard so many good things about it, I was just dying to try it out. My employee's would always brag about it. So, I got him to take me there. That visit was all I imagined & more. So, I recently rounded up my friends back in February of this year & off we went.  It is always quite a long wait. So, be prepared. If you don't have ant patience you better venture else where.  Now this, Cheesecake factory just happens to be located in Macy's Union square you catch the elevator & up you go to the floor with amazing food & ambiance. I love the interior of this place it's like a formal but contemporary. The lighting is dim to set a romantic tone. It is just gorgeous on the inside makes yo feel like your really somewhere special. You also have the option of outdoor seating & heated outdoor seating at that. As they have torches or heating lamps set up. The view is amazing as your over looking union square, sky scrapers & the outdoor ice skating rink. My friends & I took this seating option. Now, on to my favorite part the food. I had the Shrimp Scampi and Steak Diane:mouth watering  Shrimp Scampi sautéed in buttery garlic white wine sauce,  sprinkled in basil and tomato. The steak Diane is something to talk about juicy Angus Beef Steak cooked to perfection  covered with black peppercorns smothered  in a  rich mushroom wine sauce with a side of wonderful  garlic mashed potatoes. This honestly has to be the very best steak I've had in a while & I have not came across a steak as good since unfortunately. This whole meal was worth every last dime. I'm yearning for it as we speak.  Now let's get down to the Cheesecake part of the Cheesecake factory as that is what they are known for. I had the over the top  Hershey's Chocolate Bar Cheesecake. Let me tell you what this bad boy consist of: velvety Hershey's Cheesecake along with soft luscious Chocolate Cake. It is oh so moist. That's not all its  topped with Creamy Chocolate Frosting with a whole wall of Chocolate Chips. Oh, this is it for any chocolate lover. It is rich but not over bearing. It's heaven in every bite. Not only is it delicious but it  is a work of art. It is almost too pretty to eat. My boy friend doesn't even like sweets & he loved there cheese cake & that says a lot. I love them I must come back soon. There food is calling me! -Elena ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=760,3.28,3.49,3.2,3.124,3.406

Once we sat down, a very professional server approached us and took our drink orders. She stated that our waiter is on break and that he will follow up with us shortly. Since we reviewed the menu while waiting, she also took our order. I ordered a mojito and she suggested a glass of water while waiting for my cocktail. That told me that the bar was backed up. I appreciated her suggestion. However, after 10 minutes, no water. She walked by our table a few minutes later and I asked her for the water. She said our regular server would be along with that. 15 minutes in and the water shows up with the cocktail. It's just water. I don't think anyone should wait that long for something so simple. We ordered two mushroom/onion/cheese burgers with side salads. I ordered medium ad hubs ordered med rare. Mine was ok, his was not med rare at all. Barely any pink. The mushroom and onions were so skimpy and there was only once slice of cheese when the menu said two slices. I mentioned the skimpy toppings to our server and he didn't offer to get more. He simply said that's the way it is. For a 1/4 lb  burger that was smaller than the bun with 6 pieces of mushrooms and 3 pieces of onion, I was shocked at the $11 price. I noticed the lady next to me also complain about her food. There was a missing ingredient as well. Oh I forgot, the mushrooms were Luke warm and the cheese was a bit cold. The other reason I'm giving a low rating is because our regular server barely communicated. No thank yous, no acknowledgments, nothing.  At the end, he only asked if we wanted dessert. Hell no. Not going to help your up selling when you can't help make your customers happy. We tipped 10% to reflect the minimal and skimpy service. Next time I will give my gift card away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=2160,3.24,3.42,3.188,2.7280000000000006,3.3480000000000008

It was the last day before my mother went back to Mexico so naturally my brothers and I wanted to do something for her so cheesecake factory it was.  They don't take reservations even for large parties so we decided to wing it. Big mistake, they told us it would be an hour long wait (typical) but 4 of us would be seated at one table and the other 4 at another table separately,(not so typical) not even close to each other! And if we waited for a table large enough we would get it by closing time; it was 8:30 on a Saturday. They close at 12:30! Really you guys couldn't so better huh? Needless to say we ended up at CF in Walnut Creek, but that's a whole other HORRIBLE review. (let's just say bad bad bad customer service).

After about a 20-25 min wait on a Friday night, we scored seats on their rooftop terrace.  We had such a nice view as we were eating dinner, I couldn't have been more pleased with my pick for dinner that night. I got my usual, the chicken bellagio, and it did not let me down. I love how much pesto flavor I can taste in the pasta and the crispyness of the chicken with the salty prosciutto just makes the dish so addicting. But I always have trouble finishing this massive plate of food. It can literally feed 2-3 people, depending on how hungry you are.  I also tried his smokehouse bbq burger which was pretty damn good, not even going to lie. Especially if you're a guy. This is a man's burger. The fries were super crispy but not crispy so that there was nothing left inside.  All in all, a must try if you've never been to cheesecake factory, especially at this location.

4807,Elaine W.,"San Francisco, United States",142,324,139.0,3.0,2012-08-01,"In the handful of times I've gone here with coworkers, friends, family...our experiences are always 50/50. The cheesecakes alone deserve 5 stars (my fave is the red velvet), service is a 3 on a good day, and the rest of the menu can range from 1 to 4. On our last visit, we went for Sunday brunch round 11am. Got two salmon platters, a coffee, and a mint sweet tea. The salmon platter was very well presented...smoked salmon slices, greens, tomatoes & onion, a scoop of cream cheese and a bagel. Everything was good except for the bagel which was not toasted and was rock hard/stale. We ended up asked for a basket of their complimentary sourdough and oat bread instead. The coffee was extremely watered down...evidenced in the glass cup it was served in - it looked more like tea than coffee. The mint tea was refreshing...I'm thinking of opting out of the sweetener next time cause it was too syrupy. Free refills were offered on both drinks...I thought it funny that the coffee was the same price as the mint tea $3.25...that's more like the price of a latte! On future visits I will skip the coffees and simple beverages and go for the mimosas and other cocktails. Also, if you dine here during the day, unless it's windy out, definitely opt for outside seating where you can get a great view of Union Square.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=2180,3.08,3.19,3.212,2.732,3.146
2635,Vincent C.,"Imperial Beach, CA",19,60,4.0,4.0,2012-08-03,"I love cheesecakes... especially when they're half off! Okay, maybe that was irrelevant, but they're half off during ""National Cheesecake Day"" -- dine in only and limit of one! Anyway, I really dislike big restaurant chains... but who can resist Cheesecake Factory?! I've been to a lot of locations and this one is probably THE best location. I mean, c'mon, rooftop location, seeing the skyscrapers, chill weather, sun's out? Yes, it's awesome. So make sure you pick balcony/outdoor seating. Makes everything better. In addition to the location, their servers were great here. I love GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE as always :) We had two different wait staff because one had to go on a break, but they were both great. Checked up on us frequently, refilled our waters, asked if we needed anything else. Great! The wait can be long sometimes here, but this location is huge and it can accommodate a lot. The waiting area might be cramped sometimes, but be patient! Food is a little expensive here, but it is well worth it. Main dishes like pastas are usually good for two (or 1.5)... just eat their bread (which is complimentary and good with black vinegar + olive oil too!). For my main dish, I got pasta with chicken and sun dried tomatoes... soooo good (even after taking home and reheating it!). For cheesecake, I got the new OREO DREAMblahblah CHEESECAKE!

3393,Rex X.,"Berkeley, CA",42,63,92.0,4.0,2012-08-04,"Half off cheesecake, what what?! Totally there! I invited along my international friend and the two of us set out for the Cheesecake Factory in Union Square. The line to get into the elevator was pretty long, so we had to wait a round before we got in. We arrived at the host counter around 6:15pm, and we were told that the wait would be 35 minutes. Not bad!  When we came back, our buzzer vibrated at 35 minutes on the dot, and we were seated outside. Both of us were starving, but we decided to share an appetizer and main dish because 1. I don't eat very much 2. we were told to expect large portions and 3. to save room for cheesecake. That ended up being the wisest decision of the night. We finished their complimentary bread (I prefer the darker ones, very nomnomie), gobbled down the appetizer (avocado rolls, absolutely heavenly), and by the time our main dish arrived we were forced to slow down else risk stomach explosion. My only gripe about our experience at the restaurant was that the servers seemed to be assigned to specific tables, and our particular server was especially busy juggling several tables inside and outside. Thus, when we needed anything, we had to wait until she was available to get her attention. There were literally four servers behind the staff area out on the patio all of 20 feet away from our table staring at us as we tried to signal for the check, and none of them moved. I can understand that the tip we leave won't go to them, but really?  We ordered a cheesecake slice to share (lemon raspberry) and I bought another (red velvet) for a friend. The cheesecake tasted amazing, but is very, very rich, and given the state of our stomachs, we had a very hard time finishing it. I ended up taking most of my slice home. The red velvet slice came in a box literally triple the size of the one that we had to pack away the lemon raspberry. My butthead of a friend decided to not come and claim it for a week, thus effectively occupying one shelf in my fridge for a good 6 days -____-.

I really wanted to eat there, so we took a pager and went window-shopping around the block. After 1h20 we came back to the building and we were told we would be seated soon.

Then he ordered a steak Diane medium rare. It came out well over well-done. It was ridiculous how brown it was. Would it have been my steak, I would have sent it back immediately because there is no way I can eat something this cooked. He is far too nice and did not say anything. But he passed on dessert. The waiter came twice to our table  to tell us very weird jokes. I don;t know if he was trying to create a connection to get a better tip or if he was nervous but it was plain weird.

We asked for first available seating which turned out to be outdoors and perfectly lovely, just a little chilly.  The only reason I'm giving this review four stars is because I felt their directions to us regarding seating were confusing.  When we agreed to sit outside, they did not give us the buzzer and told us to just stand to the side (near the elevators).  There were so many people and waitstaff coming an going that I feared we had gotten lost in the shuffle and would not be called.  After a little arguing with my friend, he assured me that we would be called soon.  And he was right, we were called in about 10 minutes, as soon as they had cleared a table for us.  Had we wanted to sit inside, I'm sure we would have waited much much longer. The night was lovely and foggy, but that's perfect San Francisco.  The view of Union Square was great from the upstairs balcony. We both ordered salmon.  My friend tried the bar-b-que salmon and I had the herbed salmon.  It was wonderful and juicy.  My friend also had a strawberry lemonade which he said was really really good.  You could see the strawberry seeds floating in his glass.  Yum! Unfortunately we were too full to try any cheesecake, which I really wanted my friend to try.  But, maybe next time.  Their portions are large enough that sometimes you need to come to The Cheesecake Factory just for dessert.

If you want room for cheesecake at the end, I recommend sharing an entree with someone. My recommendations: - Renee's Special: I chose Chicken Almond Salad Sandwich and the sandwich was so delicious! This special is so huge because it comes with a big bowl of soup with a large portion of green salad. Besides the Chicken Salad Sandwich, you have the option of choosing Fresh Turkey Sandwich instead. - Chicken Bellagio: This dish was very good. I loved the taste of the basil pasta.

To begin, there was no security guard or doorman at front entrance, but a homeless man (while very nice) opened the door for us. Upon entering the rustle and bustle of the restaurant did intrigue me, feeling like a 1940's L.A Club. The view of the Union Square is fantastic from that angle. Our party of 10 was informed of a wait for about 45 minutes, to which we simply went to the bar and got some beers. Aside from being a tad overcrowded, the fresh Pyrimd ale and Stella Atrois was refreshing and worth it. Luckily our buzzer went of informing us that our table was ready. However, seating didn't occur for about 15 minutes later. While the rest of our party attempted to join us, we had a good look at the menu (I read it 5 times to which I might add their selection is diverse and of great quality from the smell). However, we stayed seated for 35 minutes without a waiter one time come up to us and ask if we wished to start with something. Even after I went and complained to the shift coordinator about the service, we still waited for another 5-10 minutes without anyone to come and service us. At that point I was so appalled I simply left establishment with my party. While the food might have been great I was not able to try it because the service was so terrible. When dealing with any type of business, the most important thing is the service. This is why I have chosen to give this a 1/5, not for the content on the menu.

1841,Patrick V.,"San Diego, United States",20,49,84.0,3.0,2012-09-01,"This particular Cheesecake Factory is located on the top floor of Macy's across from Union Square.  Seating options are indoor and outdoor.  There is usually a bit of a wait for a table depending on the time, you can call in advance to reserve.  Otherwise, you could end up waiting anywhere from 10-20 minutes. I personally prefer to sit indoors due to my paranoia of birds and bird droppings.  If the normally overcast sky of San Francisco is clear, this is a good outdoor dining area that will also give you a good view of the city. The food quality is pretty good.  Good ingredients, prepared well.  The style of food here is varied but does not stray too far from classic recipes.  There are traditional American dishes on the menu like Burgers, Meatloaf, Rotisserie Chicken, etc things that you would expect to see on a 'chain restaurant' menu but you will also see things like Fish Taco's,  Orange Chicken and Sheppards Pie on the menu.  The portions are HUGE!  I'm talking fat American size portions.  They do offer something they call ""lunch size"" portions on some of the dishes but most of them are way too big to finish in one sitting.  They have a full bar on one side of the restaurant. Prices are reasonable considering the amount of food.  I've never made it to desert which is a shame because their cheescakes and deserts look really good.

The food is great but the customer service and attentiveness of the waiters/ waitresses is definitely lacking.  The few times I've been here I've been mistreated as a customer but still I continue to return. The manager is nice and understanding however the rest of the workers really need to get to par. Each time I eat here it always ends up being a three to four hour event. Waiting for a table takes about 45 minutes to 2 hours depending on the size of the group and time of day. After getting situated you wait another 20 minutes for them to take your order 15 minutes later they finally give you some bread and about a half an hour later (sometimes more) your food comes out. I can honestly say I have witnessed one of my WORST restaurant experiences here. Not because of the wait time but also for the way our waiter treated our group. In the end our waiter only came to our table twice and we got charged dinner menu price even though it was still lunch time. For some reason the busboys were serving us, other waiters, and no one ever checked up on us. I know this kind of service only happened to me once but other times I have been here the service has been similar and it was enough to break my patience and appreciativeness toward this restaurant.

We asked for first available seating which turned out to be outdoors and perfectly lovely, just a little chilly.  The only reason I'm giving this review four stars is because I felt their directions to us regarding seating were confusing.  When we agreed to sit outside, they did not give us the buzzer and told us to just stand to the side (near the elevators).  There were so many people and waitstaff coming an going that I feared we had gotten lost in the shuffle and would not be called.  After a little arguing with my friend, he assured me that we would be called soon.  And he was right, we were called in about 10 minutes, as soon as they had cleared a table for us.  Had we wanted to sit inside, I'm sure we would have waited much much longer. The night was lovely and foggy, but that's perfect San Francisco.  The view of Union Square was great from the upstairs balcony. We both ordered salmon.  My friend tried the bar-b-que salmon and I had the herbed salmon.  It was wonderful and juicy.  My friend also had a strawberry lemonade which he said was really really good.  You could see the strawberry seeds floating in his glass.  Yum!

4698,Jeremy R.,"Salinas, United States",119,82,,1.0,2012-10-02,"I reluctantly visited this place with my family over the holidays and I am afraid to say that my reluctance was warranted. First of all the wait is horrible, and we were a party of 9 so it was even worse. We offered to break up our party, but still waited over an hour to be seated. When we were finally seated the hostess tried to squeeze 6 adults in an area clearly designated for less people. It wasn't till a manager was summoned that the seating situation was rectified. My wife and I ordered the avocado rolls to start and those were fresh and quite tasty, so I began to feel a bit encouraged by this and thought we might have an enjoyable experience after all. I proceeded to order the blackened chicken sandwich, my wife ordered the shrimp fettuccine. When my sandwich arrived it was dry and tough, as if it had been microwaved and served quickly. My wife's dish was adequate, but nothing to write home about. My kids went with the safe bet and ordered burgers, which actually turned out ok. We then ordered desert and this was in fact the highlight of the whole experience as they did serve a great cheesecake. As it was I truly was not having a memorable experience, when one of the servers snapped at my daughter for asking him where the bathroom was. At that point I decided to speak to a manager, who did apologize and take 10% off my bill, but it did little to sway my opinion of this place. Overall less than mediocre food, way overpriced, and horrible service makes for a terrible review. I do not reccomended this location and will not be back anytime soon.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=2060,2.88,3.11,3.26,2.148,3.018

After about a 20-25 min wait on a Friday night, we scored seats on their rooftop terrace.  We had such a nice view as we were eating dinner, I couldn't have been more pleased with my pick for dinner that night. I got my usual, the chicken bellagio, and it did not let me down. I love how much pesto flavor I can taste in the pasta and the crispyness of the chicken with the salty prosciutto just makes the dish so addicting. But I always have trouble finishing this massive plate of food. It can literally feed 2-3 people, depending on how hungry you are.  I also tried his smokehouse bbq burger which was pretty damn good, not even going to lie. Especially if you're a guy. This is a man's burger. The fries were super crispy but not crispy so that there was nothing left inside.  All in all, a must try if you've never been to cheesecake factory, especially at this location.

The food is good and the service is great.  I did have one visit when the waiter attending us was extremely rude and seemed like he hated his job, but all the other waiters/waitresses from my other visits were phenomenal. They give amazing recommendations and are very familiar with the dishes. They also check up on you often to see if you need anything.  I've had the four-cheese pasta, mac and cheese burger, and several appetizers such as buffalo wings and of course a cheesecake for dessert.  If you're coming here just for the cheesecake, I wouldn't recommend it.The cheesecake is definitely good here, but there's better. On the plus side, they have a large variety of cheesecakes, so you are bound to find something you like.  The food is definitely well cooked, always served hot and well plated. The outside seating on the balcony is amazing at night and they do have heating vents to keep you warm.  I would say this place is more casual, not something you would have to dress up for.  I love the white-chocolate raspberry cheesecake and the white-chocolate chip one. One slice can definitely be split among two people. From all my past experiences I've never finished a whole slice with another person. We were all left full from the large portions of our main dishes + appetizers.  Skip the salads, they are very average and unless you find it a necessity I would pass this one up.

I've only been to a Cheesecake Factory once before and I remember thinking that my experience was average (food wise). This time wasn't that different.  This branch is a lot busier than others simply because it's located in downtown San Francisco.The wait was about 30 minutes but we just went downstairs to look at the furniture. Be wary of wandering out of the restaurant floor because the little machine they give you while you wait might not receive the signal to alert you. There were three of us: me, my brother, and my sister-in-law. We eat a lot, so we ordered a lot. We got stuffed mushrooms and fried mac n cheese balls for appetizer, we each got huge dishes for meals (I ordered the tomato basil pasta), and two of us each got cheesecake slices.  The appetizers were okay. The stuffed mushrooms were not to my liking (small and not really stuffed) and the fried mac n cheese was too salty for my taste like the last time I had it. My pasta was very bland. The ahi tuna salad thing my sister-in-law got was boring without the tuna. The mushroom swiss burger my brother got was good but not memorable. Pretty average. The cheesecakes were good. My brother got the chocolate coconut cream and I got pumpkin pecan. His was good but I felt like the coconut taste was artificial. My pumpkin pecan was good.  I would recommend...it's just a very heavy cheesecake. All cheesecakes there are heavy.  Overall, food was whatever. I don't mind too much because I didn't pay for it at the time.

The only catch is the long wait (because there's no reservations) but you just gotta time it right. But thank god for Macys. Cheesecake Factory is right above Macy so you can explore around the top two floors until the table is ready.  I love to eat, I eat a lot but this place really makes me full. You know what I'm talking about right? Those days where you are too full that you might puke? Yeah, only go there with an empty stomach you won't regret it. During lunch, their portions may not seem like a lot, but trust me it's HECKA FILLING. If you look hard enough, you don't have to kill your wallet for a good lunch. They do have that extra SF Health Charge thing going on but hey, it tastes good, you get good bread and butter, you get good service. You get to eat in a lively, clean, comfortable, fancy setting. What more could you possibly want?  If you are looking for a five star restaurant with a dress code, then get out of here. You gotta look somewhere else. This place is perfect for prom night, birthday dinner or even a casual lunch.  If you come here for dinner and it's a bit chilly outside, don't fear. That's why we have heat lamps invented. If you choose to eat outside, you can totally eat on the patio ish area where you get an amazing view of Union square. Here's a SF secret, come to the Cheesecake factory at night time during Christmas time, you get to see the tall bright tree. That's like a room with a view but a dinner with a view and a heat lamp. HOW COOL IS THAT? Here's another SFsecret, come during the chinese new year parade, you can watch the parade without the crowds and stinkbombs.  The icing on top would be that if you do choose to eat outside, you can have a candle lit on your table. SF can be pretty windy so if it is windy outside and you choose to have a candle on, it might go out in a few minutes.  I recommend all of my friends to come here when we have money and time. If you have nothing to do and you want to eat a lot of American food, definitely this is the place to go, especially right after shopping.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=1100,3.04,2.97,3.212,2.9640000000000004,2.998

4978,Alexander F.,"San Francisco, United States",63,21,,1.0,2012-11-08,"While my review is a little skewed and in-complete, my limited experience at the Cheescake Factory in Macy's in San Francisco is bar far the definition of faux pas when in regards to service. To begin, there was no security guard or doorman at front entrance, but a homeless man (while very nice) opened the door for us. Upon entering the rustle and bustle of the restaurant did intrigue me, feeling like a 1940's L.A Club. The view of the Union Square is fantastic from that angle. Our party of 10 was informed of a wait for about 45 minutes, to which we simply went to the bar and got some beers. Aside from being a tad overcrowded, the fresh Pyrimd ale and Stella Atrois was refreshing and worth it. Luckily our buzzer went of informing us that our table was ready. However, seating didn't occur for about 15 minutes later. While the rest of our party attempted to join us, we had a good look at the menu (I read it 5 times to which I might add their selection is diverse and of great quality from the smell). However, we stayed seated for 35 minutes without a waiter one time come up to us and ask if we wished to start with something. Even after I went and complained to the shift coordinator about the service, we still waited for another 5-10 minutes without anyone to come and service us. At that point I was so appalled I simply left establishment with my party. While the food might have been great I was not able to try it because the service was so terrible. When dealing with any type of business, the most important thing is the service. This is why I have chosen to give this a 1/5, not for the content on the menu. If new management is set in place, I will consider going there again, until then, there are plenty of amazing other restaurants in the Union Square area (with better service).",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=2360,2.92,2.95,3.208,2.5000000000000004,2.9379999999999997

Just writing a review on it makes me want some more. The chicken madeira was pretty good. Not the best but it's good. Some part of it was bland, some part tasted a lot like wine and some have a lot of flavor. Whoever did the mixing for this chicken didn't do a good job at it. The mushrooms on the chicken madeira and steak was really good. I love mushrooms in case you haven't noticed. I can eat mushrooms with almost anything. Not a big fan of their mashed potatoes. TOO HARD and not a whole lot flavor to it. Just kinda boring.  The bread they give you before your food comes out is the best. I can eat that all day and night and won't get sick of it.  My husband ordered the mushroom burger and he said that it tasted really good. Not so dry like other restaurant burgers. The fries was cooked well but please HOLD THE SALT. The french fries was drowning in salt. NO BUENO. For dessert we had the Hershey's Chocolate Cheesecake and OMG this was HEAVEN. I was already full but I couldn't put the fork down after one bite.

Some part of it was bland, some part tasted a lot like wine and some have a lot of flavor. Whoever did the mixing for this chicken didn't do a good job at it. The mushrooms on the chicken madeira and steak was really good. I love mushrooms in case you haven't noticed. I can eat mushrooms with almost anything. Not a big fan of their mashed potatoes. TOO HARD and not a whole lot flavor to it. Just kinda boring.  The bread they give you before your food comes out is the best. I can eat that all day and night and won't get sick of it.  My husband ordered the mushroom burger and he said that it tasted really good. Not so dry like other restaurant burgers. The fries was cooked well but please HOLD THE SALT. The french fries was drowning in salt. NO BUENO. For dessert we had the Hershey's Chocolate Cheesecake and OMG this was HEAVEN. I was already full but I couldn't put the fork down after one bite. It was addicting and crazily yummy. I will definitely order it again next time. This cheesecake factory is located on the upper level above Macy's building in SF. So of course parking definitely sucks and it is always crowded.

Seriously, that and the lure of cheesecake are the only reasons why I would ever consider coming here.  It may seem like I'm ragging on this restaurant, but I have no real complaints.  I mean, it's just like any other chain restaurant: variety of food and drinks, nice decor, decent service, and solid food. But the experience of sitting out on the patio (if it's not that cold outside or if it is cold, and you can brave the cold) or even sitting next to the huge windows that look out into the patio makes the wait worth it! I know people often complain about the wait, but I think if you come here at like 6:00 on a weekday, you'll likely beat the dinner crowd and have your choice of tables. I would say this is definitely one of those places to take your out-of-town friends and family when they come visit the city. Not only is it in a really pretty part of town (next to the Tiffany's and Louis Vuitton stores), but there's a huge tourist draw.

I've celebrated many birthdays and occasions at Cheesecake Factory. My last experience at the one in SF however kind of let me down. We went here last sunday for an late lunch/early dinner. During our 2+hr dinner. Our server had changed 3 times-- it made it very confusing when we needed something. It also took extra long for our drinks and food to come out, probably because the server who took our order was different than the server bringing our food & the server who brought our food was different from the server who checked us out. It did not make for a smooth dinner.  The food is usually very pleasing. However his last time, the presentation lacked. My salad looked as though the greens weren't that fresh and someone did not put much effort to make it look... like something you'd want to eat. My fish came out the same way-- very sloppy and sad to look at.  Nonetheless, these reasons would not halt me from EVER coming back to the cheesecake factory-- afterall, I grew up eating here.

These were surprisingly healthy (ignore the fact they're deep fried), and the mix of avocado/tomato/onions (more like very chunky guacamole) was incredible. Even though there was no meat, these egg rolls were very filling. The Egg Rolls also come with a tamarind peanut dipping sauce - a must try with the egg rolls! Even though the wait can be long for seating (at one point people were waiting for indoor tables for 2 hours, but we chose outdoor seating where the wait time was 30 minutes), the cheesecake is definitely worth the wait.

384,Kinner J.,"Napa, CA",42,145,43.0,4.0,2013-01-03,Love coming here for the grilled salmon lunch! It is very hard to resist the delicious cheesecake!!! TIP: Eat early or late because the wait can get VERY LONG. We came during the peak of the lunch hour and waited more than 30 minutes for an inside table. I have come in the past at odd hours and been seated almost immediately. If you go out onto the patio there are great views of Union Square. At Christmas time it is fun to look at all the lights and the large tree. When indulging I really like to get the Godiva chocolate cheesecake -- if you like chocolate you won't be disappointed!!! They also have seasonal cheesecakes that are very good (summer = mango keylime!),https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=1140,3.04,3.03,3.084,3.12,3.034

I could eat baskets of the slightly sweet bread with the chewy oats on top! I came here again for the first time in a couple years, and the portions were just as big as I remembered. The Skinnylicious chicken pasta was really good, with pieces of juicy grilled chicken and pasta that was cooked to the chewy texture I like. The fresh tomatoes and basil were a nice extra touch too! I also had that rare burger craving, so we tried the Kobe burger which was huge. I loved the caramelized onions and shiitake mushrooms on top, which gave it an Asian flavor. The bun was nicely toasted, and the meat was perfectly cooked. Overall, food here is good, but nothing that's particularly extraordinary. Except for the cheesecake! First of all, the variety of cheesecake alone makes me excited. I tried the chocolate tuxedo cheesecake for the first time, and it was chocolate heaven. I loved that it had chocolate cake on the bottom and a layer of mascarpone cheese, which made it less heavy overall (as opposed to having the entire thing be cheesecake). The chocolate cheesecake was perfect with the other two layers. My favorite part was the crust on the back, which was chocolatey and crunchy and perfect!

This location is on the 8th floor of Macys. I entered the elevator, excited as can be to celebrate the debut of the new Toasted Marshmallow S'mores Galore Cheesecake (plus 50% off any slice!), only to find myself so close, yet so far from satisfying my sweet tooth. The elevator inched upwards to the restaurant, when suddenly, I hear something very similar to a large piece of metal falling. Next thing I know, the elevator stops, but the doors refuse to open. The innermost set of doors shakes before opening, but the outermost doors only slightly part. As people try to pry the doors open, another piece of metal seems to fall, giving the terrifying idea that the elevator is falling apart. We all look at the max capacity sign: 10 people max. We count exactly 10 in the elevator. One person attempts to press the button for help, but to no avail. Great. Panic strikes as first, one girl states she is claustrophobic, another constantly complains it is getting hotter and harder to breathe. Definitely a harrowing experience. We shout for help at people passing by, but it takes a long time before someone finally calls the fire department. Now what? Well of course, in this new age of technology, everyone whips out their smart phone to take photos and videos to post online. Sigh. #instagraminsteadofcallforhelp Eventually, we were saved. I'm very grateful the elevator did not drop, I'm not a roller coaster fan, at all. The manager Christopher M. was super nice and considerate, offering to take care of my meal and often checking to see how I was doing. Living out my name, I felt like a true desserts princess! He recommended starting with the Strawberry Martini to calm my nerves, a deliciously strong yet sweet drink. Then I had the Steak Diane, which was perfectly cooked. Juicy and well-seasoned. Also had Mai Tai, which comes in an interesting glass and looks quite tropical. Finally, ended with the featured S'mores Cheesecake, which had amazingly gooey, toasted marshmallow and was not overwhelmingly sweet. At this location, the ceilings are not as high as the other locations I've frequented. However, there's a patio with a nice view of Union Square (plus pigeons walking around your feet and hopelessly staring at your food). My only complaints (minus the elevator experience, which really wasn't Cheesecake Factory's fault): The indoor floors are slippery, and my group did not receive the complimentary bread until our entrees arrived. Incredible meal and friendly service (thank you so very much Christopher!), but what a night! Still a Cheesecake Factory fan nonetheless.

I hate when you order multiple courses and they come all at once- but they kept a nice pace. Chicken taquitos were yummy- served hot and flavorable. Caesar salad- fresh, crisp, but lacking in dressing- request extra dressing on side- also ask for small dinner Caesar which isn't listed on the menu. Shrimp platter- hot- fresh and abundant! Cooked to perfection. Served with fries and coleslaw( not just a tbsp). All good Chicken piccata - yummy- 2-3 thin seasoned slices of chicken- yummy piccata sauce, served with noodles- little over cooked and dried out. Chicken Madeira - yummy yummy sauce, thin slices of chicken, served with mashed potato- dry. Cheesecake slices/ ohhhhhh myyyyyy goooooodness! Freaking delish! Huge huge slices.

Honestly, the wait isn't really worth it. My party of 8 had to wait over 2 hours for a seat. (We went around 5:45.) I mean I love the Cheesecake Factory, but the wait is just ridiculous. It might've been just our big party because the few times I went before our party had 2 people. (They told us the wait would be an hour and a half, but we just waited half an hour. So I hoped it'd happen this time! But it didn't sadly.)  On to the food. I had the Hibachi steak. I wasn't really sure what it was, but I trusted the Factory. The steak was already cut up (I like to actually cut my own steaks) and was marinated a lot with their sauce. It tasted great. The sauce was awesome too. My friends couldn't finish their plates so I just dipped their food into my left over sauce and it was delicious!  I shared a tiramisu cheesecake. I normally don't eat tiramisu just because I don't like the taste. But for some reason mixing it into a cheesecake makes it that much better.  I'd recommend this place, but if you don't want to eat at 9:30, come around 5 or 5:30.

Never again.  The food is marginally better than say, a Denny's, ...but at least Denny's has clean dishes.  This review is only for the restaurant located in Union Square, but it only takes one bad experience like this to turn me off to the whole chain.  Yuck!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=1600,3.32,3.22,3.1,3.236,3.2600000000000007

I've dined at many Cheesecake Factory locations over 15 years and this location is by far my favorite.  It's located on the 8th floor of the Macy's building in Union Square.  You can dine outside (they've got heaters out there for cold nights) & see great views of union square.  I especially like dining here during the Christmas season where you can see the Christmas tree and people ice skating below. A lot of people complain that this place is too busy & there's a long wait but there's a reason for that...it's that good!!!  If you don't want to wait come during off-peaks hours (late night), find a seat at the bar, or take your order to go.   Once you're seated you get to enjoy fresh baked loaves of wheat & sourdough bread served with a side of butter.

I know it's probably going to be over a 1.5 hour wait at any given hour of the day, but please you don't have to be so pretentious about telling me that. Come on. Servers are trying, but they're busy and tend not to be attentive. Service is quite sub par compared to other locations. The food is still good.

The Skinnylicious chicken pasta was really good, with pieces of juicy grilled chicken and pasta that was cooked to the chewy texture I like. The fresh tomatoes and basil were a nice extra touch too! I also had that rare burger craving, so we tried the Kobe burger which was huge. I loved the caramelized onions and shiitake mushrooms on top, which gave it an Asian flavor. The bun was nicely toasted, and the meat was perfectly cooked. Overall, food here is good, but nothing that's particularly extraordinary. Except for the cheesecake! First of all, the variety of cheesecake alone makes me excited. I tried the chocolate tuxedo cheesecake for the first time, and it was chocolate heaven. I loved that it had chocolate cake on the bottom and a layer of mascarpone cheese, which made it less heavy overall (as opposed to having the entire thing be cheesecake). The chocolate cheesecake was perfect with the other two layers. My favorite part was the crust on the back, which was chocolatey and crunchy and perfect!

I've been here a few times, usually for celebratory purposes, and I have no specific complaint except that the elevator ride is usually tight quarters and there isn't a lot of standing space around once you put your name in for a table.

On this particular outing, it was just a 20 minute wait, so our little crew shuffled outside to take in the pretty fantastic view of Union Square at sunset. The bar is also a nice spot to go if you're a small party - if you can snag a table or bar seats, skip the wait and eat there.

The steak was already cut up (I like to actually cut my own steaks) and was marinated a lot with their sauce. It tasted great. The sauce was awesome too. My friends couldn't finish their plates so I just dipped their food into my left over sauce and it was delicious!  I shared a tiramisu cheesecake. I normally don't eat tiramisu just because I don't like the taste. But for some reason mixing it into a cheesecake makes it that much better.

My friend and I came in the day before national cheesecake day with the Facebook offer for a half priced slice of cheesecake.  We gave ourselves 3 hours just to make sure we didn't need to rush to our next engagement.  At 1:00 in the afternoon on a Tuesday, this didn't seem unreasonable.  We were wrong. First, this place has the strangest atmosphere.  There are locals, tourists, homeless people, and the employees all jammed into the top floor of Macy's.  We were taking the elevator up, and there was a psychotic homeless woman harassing everyone.  Remember her, she'll come back later. So we manage to get up to the hostess, get a buzzer, etc.  We're given a wait time of 45 minutes.  Fine.  45 minutes pass, and everyone who had come in before us plus two groups of 7 and 12 after us had been seated.  So I walk up to the hostess, and she clearly had never entered our names... Ok.  Mistakes happen (until you read the other Yelp reviews and see this is common.  Ugh.).  She says we'll be next.  Total time to get seated:  1.5 hours Our waitress came right over with water, got our orders right away, and was efficient. Random Digression:  Suddenly, we turn around to find the CRAZY homeless woman sitting behind us at a table for six.  She had finished her piece of cheesecake and was arguing with her poor waitress that the cheesecake should be free because she can't read her coupon.  Seriously.  For whatever reason, the waitress walked away.  So the crazy homeless woman starts going around the tables that haven't been cleaned yet taking the food off of them.  She proceeds to eat anything left on other tables.  What she couldn't eat, she was placing on her table.  She then had the nerve to ask the waitress for boxes.  The waitress comes back with boxes and her bill.  So she boxes everything, and apparently, left a pile of change.  She then RAN out of the Cheesecake Factory.  Moral of the story:  Your waitress will appreciate a good tip. Meanwhile, we got our slices of cheesecake.  My Kahula coffee cheesecake was good, but the slices here were quite a bit smaller than branches.  Our waitress was decent, though, and she got us in and out without major real pain.  Except that she lost my friend's credit card and had to go searching for it...Not good.

I thought that was a strange food combo, haha. 5 or 10 minutes had gone by since I had received my food when the waitress came by and said there had been a mistake with my meal. My plate was supposed to come WITHOUT the onion rings, which happened to be fried in PEANUT OIL. I was shocked that such a huge error was made without it being caught by anyone in the kitchen. I had her take back my meal and told her I was done eating for the night. The one thing I was trusting the restaurant to keep out of my food, was carelessly sitting on top! It is a horrible feeling to have to think about death while doing everyday things like sitting down to eat. It is also a horrible feeling knowing you're trusting your life with those handling your food, only to have a mix up that could have killed you! To me, it showed a lack of concern for my particular situation. I was never offered a comped meal or even an apology from the waitress or any other staff/managers for that matter. It was not a happy dining experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=1980,3.48,3.51,3.196,2.9800000000000004,3.498

This location in Union Square is my favorite, everytime I come here in downtown SF I always come to this Cheesecake factory location after a long shopping... This is a nice place to hang out with your friends have some delicious cheesecake and coffee..hmmm yummy! my favorite among their cheesecakes are Dulce de Leche and Red Velvet!. It sweet but not too sweet just right...

Although the wait for a table can get somewhat lengthy, you can take a beeper and shop stores in its vicinity without it going off. Another way to pass the time is to stand outside at the balcony and people watch above Union Square.  I recommend ordering the pasta here as most other dishes range between unappetizing to delicious (unpredictable depending on day and location). Some dishes that have constantly been good and I'd recommend are  - Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic - Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta I also love the whole wheat grain bread they serve, I always make them refill the bread tray!! As for cheesecakes, I LOVE the red velvet cheesecake. If you love red velvet cupcakes, you're going to love this cheesecake. Some other ones I also recommend is Classic, Fresh Strawberry (Classic with Strawberry Syrup and Strawberries), and Oreo. Warning: Oreo is a little on the sweeter side. Pro-tip: If you're only stopping by to pick up cheesecake, simply go to the back to the Cheesecake register.

This past Saturday, we paid SF a visit and did just that. The restaurant was packed, especially since the area is known for having tourists. We were told the wait would be between 1 hour to 1 1/2 hours. It was 8 o'clock at night, we were starving, and didn't feel like looking elsewhere, so we decided to wait it out. Well, the wait ended up being 2 hours! Last minute I asked if we could sit outside, instead, since it seemed to be a little less chilly than it was 2 hours ago, but was told the wait time would be even longer. No, thanks! So, we were seated indoors in a nice booth at the corner of the restaurant and the lights were dim, as all Cheesecake Factory's are. We ordered their avocado egg rolls and fried calamari to start off with. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time and was delicious, as expected, especially the calamari. Our waitress also brought out a basket full of fresh bread and butter; kudos to her for bringing another one out once she saw we finished the first one.  For dinner, I was feeling adventurous. Usually I go with their baja chicken tacos but wanted to try something new, so, I ordered their fettuccine Alfredo without chicken. Let me tell you, it was TO DIE FOR. So creamy, so delicious, and melt-in-your-mouth good. I couldn't even finish half of it, though, partly because it was so rich and partly because we had gorged on bread and appetizers beforehand.

This past Saturday, we paid SF a visit and did just that. The restaurant was packed, especially since the area is known for having tourists. We were told the wait would be between 1 hour to 1 1/2 hours. It was 8 o'clock at night, we were starving, and didn't feel like looking elsewhere, so we decided to wait it out. Well, the wait ended up being 2 hours! Last minute I asked if we could sit outside, instead, since it seemed to be a little less chilly than it was 2 hours ago, but was told the wait time would be even longer. No, thanks!

269,Christina L.,"Winston-Salem, NC",293,518,1894.0,4.0,2013-08-01,"NATIONAL CHEESECAKE DAY GONE WRONG - THOUGHT IT'D BE A SWEET DAY Instead, I was stuck in an elevator for 45 minutes... This location is on the 8th floor of Macys. I entered the elevator, excited as can be to celebrate the debut of the new Toasted Marshmallow S'mores Galore Cheesecake (plus 50% off any slice!), only to find myself so close, yet so far from satisfying my sweet tooth. The elevator inched upwards to the restaurant, when suddenly, I hear something very similar to a large piece of metal falling. Next thing I know, the elevator stops, but the doors refuse to open. The innermost set of doors shakes before opening, but the outermost doors only slightly part. As people try to pry the doors open, another piece of metal seems to fall, giving the terrifying idea that the elevator is falling apart. We all look at the max capacity sign: 10 people max. We count exactly 10 in the elevator. One person attempts to press the button for help, but to no avail. Great. Panic strikes as first, one girl states she is claustrophobic, another constantly complains it is getting hotter and harder to breathe. Definitely a harrowing experience. We shout for help at people passing by, but it takes a long time before someone finally calls the fire department. Now what? Well of course, in this new age of technology, everyone whips out their smart phone to take photos and videos to post online. Sigh. #instagraminsteadofcallforhelp Eventually, we were saved. I'm very grateful the elevator did not drop, I'm not a roller coaster fan, at all. The manager Christopher M. was super nice and considerate, offering to take care of my meal and often checking to see how I was doing. Living out my name, I felt like a true desserts princess! He recommended starting with the Strawberry Martini to calm my nerves, a deliciously strong yet sweet drink. Then I had the Steak Diane, which was perfectly cooked. Juicy and well-seasoned. Also had Mai Tai, which comes in an interesting glass and looks quite tropical. Finally, ended with the featured S'mores Cheesecake, which had amazingly gooey, toasted marshmallow and was not overwhelmingly sweet. At this location, the ceilings are not as high as the other locations I've frequented. However, there's a patio with a nice view of Union Square (plus pigeons walking around your feet and hopelessly staring at your food). My only complaints (minus the elevator experience, which really wasn't Cheesecake Factory's fault): The indoor floors are slippery, and my group did not receive the complimentary bread until our entrees arrived. Incredible meal and friendly service (thank you so very much Christopher!), but what a night! Still a Cheesecake Factory fan nonetheless.

Got there early enough so that we didn't have to wait more than 20 minutes. Our waiter was a little cool at first, but quickly warmed up- engaging and friendly- quick. Pacing of food was good. I hate when you order multiple courses and they come all at once- but they kept a nice pace. Chicken taquitos were yummy- served hot and flavorable. Caesar salad- fresh, crisp, but lacking in dressing- request extra dressing on side- also ask for small dinner Caesar which isn't listed on the menu. Shrimp platter- hot- fresh and abundant! Cooked to perfection. Served with fries and coleslaw( not just a tbsp). All good Chicken piccata - yummy- 2-3 thin seasoned slices of chicken- yummy piccata sauce, served with noodles- little over cooked and dried out. Chicken Madeira - yummy yummy sauce, thin slices of chicken, served with mashed potato- dry. Cheesecake slices/ ohhhhhh myyyyyy goooooodness! Freaking delish! Huge huge slices. We had to get them to go and eat 3 hours later! Lol The prices are steep... 3-4$ higher than what they should be..I think each dish avg. $18... Which didn't inc. the option of soup or salad.

First of all, you have to pack into this little elevator, and nobody has a concept of personal space. Just wait for the next one, you guys. Hosts/hostesses have this rude attitude. I know it's probably going to be over a 1.5 hour wait at any given hour of the day, but please you don't have to be so pretentious about telling me that. Come on. Servers are trying, but they're busy and tend not to be attentive. Service is quite sub par compared to other locations. The food is still good.

1864,Jack T.,"Arlington, United States",0,14,,3.0,2013-08-10,"Thankfully, this restaurant is on the top level of a mall -- they don't take reservations, so it pays to go to the front desk first thing when you enter the mall to ask for a table. Their bullet vibrators (god, I hope that's the right term for it) aren't made for long-distance signals, so you're pretty much confined to walking around Macy's. If you're not into shopping for discount clothing or overpriced home goods and Cheesecake is making you wait more than 30 minutes, it's probably not worth it -- the food is as you would expect at any Cheesecake: high quantity, low quality. The thing that drew me and my girlfriend to try this particular Cheesecake was the outdoor rooftop seating.

If there's ever an add-on salad option at a restaurant, I always, always get caesar, but the salad was just terrible! It wasn't really the flavor, but the fact that the salad was horribly overdressed. My romaine was drowning in the dressing, which was so thick and creamy that I had to scrape some of it off. It was just way too heavy and again, I didn't finish it. If you get a salad with any type of creamy dressing, GET IT ON THE SIDE.  I don't understand why this place is so popular. There are always hoards of people waiting in the lobby. My guess is their convenient location, ability to accommodate large groups and their hotel island resort type of decor...oh and their delicious cheesecakes.

264,Amanda J.,"Washington, DC",1441,892,308.0,2.0,2013-09-06,"I'm not one to review a chain, but seriously, this Cheesecake Factory is an experience unto itself. My friend and I came in the day before national cheesecake day with the Facebook offer for a half priced slice of cheesecake.  We gave ourselves 3 hours just to make sure we didn't need to rush to our next engagement.  At 1:00 in the afternoon on a Tuesday, this didn't seem unreasonable.  We were wrong. First, this place has the strangest atmosphere.  There are locals, tourists, homeless people, and the employees all jammed into the top floor of Macy's.  We were taking the elevator up, and there was a psychotic homeless woman harassing everyone.  Remember her, she'll come back later. So we manage to get up to the hostess, get a buzzer, etc.  We're given a wait time of 45 minutes.  Fine.  45 minutes pass, and everyone who had come in before us plus two groups of 7 and 12 after us had been seated.  So I walk up to the hostess, and she clearly had never entered our names... Ok.  Mistakes happen (until you read the other Yelp reviews and see this is common.  Ugh.).  She says we'll be next.  Total time to get seated:  1.5 hours Our waitress came right over with water, got our orders right away, and was efficient. Random Digression:  Suddenly, we turn around to find the CRAZY homeless woman sitting behind us at a table for six.  She had finished her piece of cheesecake and was arguing with her poor waitress that the cheesecake should be free because she can't read her coupon.  Seriously.  For whatever reason, the waitress walked away.  So the crazy homeless woman starts going around the tables that haven't been cleaned yet taking the food off of them.  She proceeds to eat anything left on other tables.  What she couldn't eat, she was placing on her table.  She then had the nerve to ask the waitress for boxes.  The waitress comes back with boxes and her bill.  So she boxes everything, and apparently, left a pile of change.  She then RAN out of the Cheesecake Factory.  Moral of the story:  Your waitress will appreciate a good tip. Meanwhile, we got our slices of cheesecake.  My Kahula coffee cheesecake was good, but the slices here were quite a bit smaller than branches.  Our waitress was decent, though, and she got us in and out without major real pain.  Except that she lost my friend's credit card and had to go searching for it...Not good. I wouldn't come back here.  San Francisco has much better things to offer.  But 1/2 price cheesecake is pretty cool, and the people watching factor will lead to some great stories later.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=620,2.76,3.19,3.324,2.6000000000000005,3.018
2459,Cassandra L.,"Murrieta, United States",29,2,,1.0,2013-09-06,"My experience at The Cheesecake Factory in SF was horrible, and I will probably never eat at another one again. To start, I have a severe food allergy, so to those who also have one I'd strongly suggest not eating here. I have a severe peanut allergy and the waitress was honest and  told me all of the stations in the kitchen have peanuts, since they make a wide variety of Asian dishes. I was hesitant on ordering anything at all, as it would be at my own risk. However, she reassured me that I would be accommodated and she would let the kitchen know about my situation and they would be very careful. It made me feel safer  so I ordered my meal. I ordered a side of mashed potatoes with my food, which oddly came with onion rings on top?? I thought that was a strange food combo, haha. 5 or 10 minutes had gone by since I had received my food when the waitress came by and said there had been a mistake with my meal. My plate was supposed to come WITHOUT the onion rings, which happened to be fried in PEANUT OIL. I was shocked that such a huge error was made without it being caught by anyone in the kitchen. I had her take back my meal and told her I was done eating for the night. The one thing I was trusting the restaurant to keep out of my food, was carelessly sitting on top! It is a horrible feeling to have to think about death while doing everyday things like sitting down to eat. It is also a horrible feeling knowing you're trusting your life with those handling your food, only to have a mix up that could have killed you! To me, it showed a lack of concern for my particular situation. I was never offered a comped meal or even an apology from the waitress or any other staff/managers for that matter. It was not a happy dining experience!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=1980,2.72,3.16,3.308,2.468,2.9840000000000004

If you sit outside, you get a nice view of the Union Square :) you can turn it into a romantic dinner! but the wait is longer for the outside seating so we just sit inside lol too hungry to wait. Although the food&drinks feel a bit overpriced, they do give you big portions. Few favorites:  Shrimp Scampi - big big shrimps with angel hair pasta in creamy tomato sauce?, I wish it was more ""lemoney"". Avocado Eggrolls - crispy hot avocados...can't go wrong with them avocados! Navajo Sandwich - crispy bread with yummy feelings. not too heavy. one of my fav's but I didn't see it on the menu...maybe they don't serve it anymore? or I just missed it. Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp - yum yum yum, sweet&savory. It's kinda hard to describe the taste but it's definitely good! Cajun Jambalaya Pasta - extremely tender chicken chunks...kinda boring taste at first but gets better. Mojito - overpriced watered down...meh never again. Banana Cheesecake & Red Velvet Cheesecake - two of my fav cheesecakes!  Also love the black bread they serve before the meal...oh so good.

4292,Susan S.,"Petaluma, United States",31,128,73.0,4.0,2013-09-12,"Before I start the full review, my friend & me order two bloody Marys, she can't drink spicy so the bartender suggests just tomato juice for her drink we agree, mine is fantastic & spicy. My friend decides she needs more kick cause it's just vodka & bland tomato juice so we pony up to the service station & try to get the bartenders attention which we do. We wanted some of the good stuff I had in my drink added to my friends drink, just a smidge. But instead he tells the server to splash some Tabasco into the glass. That's not we expected for $9.00 drinks, he already got our tip so we were has beens. Now the rest. What a madhouse. Extreme Noise, people waiting, coming & going. This restaurant is total cookie cutter, descent fair, huge portions. And being on the 7th floor of Macys over looking union square makes for a prime location. I can't think of another restaurant that can be this successful with their large selection, portions & fair prices as well as lunch prices served til 5pm. Nice.  We ordered the avocado rolls, six large pieces served with in a crunchy fried egg roll, they might want to offer a lighter version, like endive but keep the large portion of avocado.....maybe some more herbs or spices in the avocado too. The wait staff doesn't write anything down or at least our waitress. She didn't write down we wanted the lunch portions & prices. So when we received the bill each entree was $5 more. Oh we brought it to her attention & she claimed we didn't request it, though we specifically ordered from the lunch menu & told her so & we were seated at 3pm. Is this a bait and switch? There are so many tourist there & customers that may not speak up or know how to read an American check, so I think this is standard practice. Hint, the portions are huge & a lunch portion along with all the other stuff you may order is more than sufficient. After the avocado egg rolls we both ordered salmon & the portion was great, perfectly cooked, hollandaise sauce adorned the bottom of the plate with perfect al dente asparagus on top & a nice portion of rustic red mash potatoes. For such a manic environment & apathetic waitressing & bar tending the kitchen made up for anything that was a miss. In closing I would recommend this place for location, fair prices & large portions, don't expect much from the wait staff, we still gave the staff a good tip ;-)",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=700,2.92,3.17,3.316,2.8640000000000003,3.07

Although the wait for a table can get somewhat lengthy, you can take a beeper and shop stores in its vicinity without it going off. Another way to pass the time is to stand outside at the balcony and people watch above Union Square.  I recommend ordering the pasta here as most other dishes range between unappetizing to delicious (unpredictable depending on day and location). Some dishes that have constantly been good and I'd recommend are  - Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic - Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta I also love the whole wheat grain bread they serve, I always make them refill the bread tray!! As for cheesecakes, I LOVE the red velvet cheesecake. If you love red velvet cupcakes, you're going to love this cheesecake. Some other ones I also recommend is Classic, Fresh Strawberry (Classic with Strawberry Syrup and Strawberries), and Oreo. Warning: Oreo is a little on the sweeter side.

If you're not into shopping for discount clothing or overpriced home goods and Cheesecake is making you wait more than 30 minutes, it's probably not worth it -- the food is as you would expect at any Cheesecake: high quantity, low quality.

While I pulled myself together in the restroom and called my doctor, my fiance and 2 other employees explained what happened to the manager, and what does he reply? ""Well was she drunk?"" NO I WASN'T DRUNK! Didn't you just hear that I'm pregnant? ""Well why did she fall?"" I FELL BECAUSE YOUR STAFF FAILED TO WIPE THE FLOORS. Once I met up with them, we exchanged contact information and he told us to expect a call from Corporate within the next week... That's it? You're not going to bother asking me if I'm alright? Do I need an ambulance? Free slice of cheesecake? We were too worried to bother with that then... Of course, we never received a call from corporate, but luckily for them baby was a-okay and that's all that really mattered...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=1560,3.48,3.07,3.336,2.116,3.234

My friend decides she needs more kick cause it's just vodka & bland tomato juice so we pony up to the service station & try to get the bartenders attention which we do. We wanted some of the good stuff I had in my drink added to my friends drink, just a smidge. But instead he tells the server to splash some Tabasco into the glass. That's not we expected for $9.00 drinks, he already got our tip so we were has beens. Now the rest. What a madhouse. Extreme Noise, people waiting, coming & going. This restaurant is total cookie cutter, descent fair, huge portions. And being on the 7th floor of Macys over looking union square makes for a prime location. I can't think of another restaurant that can be this successful with their large selection, portions & fair prices as well as lunch prices served til 5pm. Nice.  We ordered the avocado rolls, six large pieces served with in a crunchy fried egg roll, they might want to offer a lighter version, like endive but keep the large portion of avocado.....maybe some more herbs or spices in the avocado too. The wait staff doesn't write anything down or at least our waitress. She didn't write down we wanted the lunch portions & prices. So when we received the bill each entree was $5 more. Oh we brought it to her attention & she claimed we didn't request it, though we specifically ordered from the lunch menu & told her so & we were seated at 3pm. Is this a bait and switch? There are so many tourist there & customers that may not speak up or know how to read an American check, so I think this is standard practice. Hint, the portions are huge & a lunch portion along with all the other stuff you may order is more than sufficient. After the avocado egg rolls we both ordered salmon & the portion was great, perfectly cooked, hollandaise sauce adorned the bottom of the plate with perfect al dente asparagus on top & a nice portion of rustic red mash potatoes. For such a manic environment & apathetic waitressing & bar tending the kitchen made up for anything that was a miss.

The entrees are way overpriced for what you get.  When we paid, we noticed there was an automatic 18% gratuity! It was crazy that our gratuity was $10 when the service was not all that great! I guess it applies to groups of 5 or more bc one of our friends ordered something separately from the rest of us! It was $3 per person for tax & tip but that adds up when you have 5 people.

The entrees are way overpriced for what you get.  When we paid, we noticed there was an automatic 18% gratuity! It was crazy that our gratuity was $10 when the service was not all that great! I guess it applies to groups of 5 or more bc one of our friends ordered something separately from the rest of us! It was $3 per person for tax & tip but that adds up when you have 5 people. I think eating downtown is overrated & only worth it maybe for lunch or for off season (not during Christmas break!). Not sure if I'll come back during this time again.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=440,2.48,3.09,3.276,2.412,2.8459999999999996

The food here is actually really good, especially considering that this is a chain restaurant. We ordered the warm asparagus salad, tomato&cheese flatbread, spicy chicken chipotle pasta and the fettucine alfredo with a strawberry milkshake and a oreo milkshake. For dessert we had the snickers cheesecake and the chocolate mousse cheesecake to go.  First off, when they say small plates, they actually mean small plates. The warm asparagus salad was a very small portion, but I could have eaten buckets of it. I love green asparagus! The tomato&cheese flatbread was all right, but you could make it better at home. The fettucine alfredo was good, I liked it, so did le boyfriend but he thought that I make it better at home. Nonetheless, I enjoyed it very much. The only downside was the amount of sauce. The pasta was drowning in sauce, so by the time I had finished the pasta, half the sauce was still on the plate. Which is a waste because then you're throwing away half of the delicious and creamy sauce. I just realised that I would now love to have that leftover sauce with some garlic bread for dipping. Why did I not think of this yesterday?? Anyway, on to the spicy chipotle chicken pasta. Le boyfriend said: ""It's unlike any pasta I've ever had before. In a good way."" So that's some pretty high praise from him. :) And I must say, his plate did look delicious! Especially with the asparagus which I only realised at the end of the meal I would have loved to have had it with my pasta. Seriously, I love green asparagus.  As for the service. Our server, was sweet, friendly and helpful. He really deserved the tip. I know tipping is kind of the standard here in the U.S. but I still only tip when people actually deserve it. I can't remember our server's name though and don't have the receipt to check, but I hope he reads this and knows how much we appreciated him. So again, thank you for your wonderful service. Now, the cheesecakes. As you may know, cheesecake is my thing and I'm very picky about it. Considering that this is a chain restaurant I didn't have any expectations for the cheesecake, so I was pleasantly surprised by them. I liked them and even le boyfriend liked it and he used to hate cheesecake and will only eat the one my dad and I make. The first bite of the snickers cheesecake tastes a bit weird, but don't worry, the rest of it really does taste like snickers. And cheesecake, obviously. The chocolate mousse cheesecake is just dreamy. We both loved it and I would definitely order it again. So, to sum it up: surprisingly good food, friendly service and good cheesecake.

My friends and I came here for our NYE dinner, which was nice, since we got to look off the balcony and enjoy the view of Union Square, but then the wait... omg. We waited about an hour to an hour and a half, so it was nuts (we showed up around 4:30...). However, we were seated, had the most eccentric waiter I've EVER had--which was an amusing twist to the evening, complete with many high-fives, semi-awkward yet extremely amusing references to mistletoe, lone wolfs, and mixing of tea bags. If you have ""Chaos"" as your waiter, you're in for the weirdly enjoyable evening we have. Anyways, khalua cheesecake.

My mother and I ventured to this location for lunch after an busy morning of shopping in Union Square.   Since my mother had never eaten at a Cheesecake Factory before, I suggested we stop in for lunch since we were in the area.

We arrived at about 5:45PM and they told us we had a one hour and 25 minute wait!!! Yeah, why would they ever take reservations. The hoards of people waiting in the foyer were ridiculous. After finally getting seated, my wife went to use their restroom. She said it was flooded and there was pee all over the place - so bad that she had to straddle the toilet to go. I used the men's restroom after dinner and while it wasn't as bad, there was pee all over the seat and floor as well. Just pathetic. The service was good and our waiters seemed very attentive. However, I ordered a ceasar salad, one of the larger ones and when I got it, there was hardly any dressing on it and ""one"" crouton. If I wanted to order just a head of lettuce, I would have. My wife's salad had hardly any dressing on it as well. The steak I ordered was supposed to be cooked medium and it was so rare and undercooked, I had to poke it to see if it was still alive. I asked our waiter and they took it back to re-cook it.

I went around 9pm to pick up a slice of cheesecake to go and came out at 10pm.  The issues in short: -The escalator gate from the 7th floor of Macys to Cheesecake is closed, leaving a 5-10 minute wait just to get on the elevator to and from the restaurant.  -No organization whatsoever. There is no system here. -They ring up 100 people at the to-go line and no cheesecakes come out for 15 minutes. They then prepare the cheesecakes all at one time and get confused on who ordered what. You have to go up to them and point out what cheesecakes you ordered. I could have stolen all the cheesecakes and they wouldn't even know.  Bottom line is you should never come here if you're hungry.

I didn't care much and i enjoyed the rest of dishes. Every food was so great. However, since English is my second language, a few waitress think that i can't hear English at all. After i got our bill, i needed to break my 20bucks to two 10bucks. I was in a hurry. I tried to wait until our table waitress come. i couldn't find her. So i asked another waitress who was walking right my side. I asked her to do very nicely. She replied with frowned face and ""blah blah fu** me"". What's the matter with her? I don't know? She just wanted me to know that asking break money to other waitress was not inappropriate, or she just thought i couldn't hear or i couldn't understand what she would say? So she just said silently? I am not a deaf. I know i should have waited until our table waitress come, but i was in a hurry. Even though she was upset of me, she shouldn't have acted like that. Saying ""fu**"" word to the customer? I am so disappointed to the cheese cake factory. I am so sorry for my self to write bad story here. This is my first time to write here.

4598,Athena M.,"Irvine, United States",28,11,24.0,2.0,2014-02-11,"We came here on a Saturday night (non-holiday weekend) for my sister's birthday.  She had roughly 10 people in the party and we all promptly arrived at 6pm. We put down our names and the host told us it'll be about a 2 hour wait. We figured this would happen so others sat around chatting while some of us went to the bar to get some drinks. About an hour in, we went back up to the host stand and they told us it'll be another 45 minutes. Okay. Cool. We'll be seated sooner than expected. Again, others went to the bar and some went outside to enjoy the pleasant evening, taking in Union Square. When the 45 minutes were up, the host told us it'll be 2 hours. There was no way the party wanted to wait another 2 hours; we were hungry at this point. After explaining that we've been there since 6, the lady retracted her statement saying it'll be 10 minutes; they are cleaning up our table right now. Luckily, we were seated before we decided to go elsewhere. The waitress was friendly and took in our orders. She also helped in accommodating our tardy guest, who didn't think they'd be able to make it on time. We ordered drinks and was  delivered to our table almost instantaneously. Our food came in 30 minutes later, and she came around the table every once in awhile to check on our food and add more drink orders. What I really liked about our service was her splitting the bill before we asked for it. Service was great, the Steak Diane was on point, and some of their drinks were good.  Would I come here again?

If the weather isn't too cold and you're dressed fairly warm, definitely ask the people at the front for an outside table. You get the view of SF and rooftop dining is always awesome. I like getting outside tables during the holidays; you get to see people ice skating below which adds to the warm Christmas atmosphere that time of year. You'll have to wait a while before you can get a vacant seat. They'll take your name and hand you a device which lights up and vibrates when your table is ready. Since this Cheesecake Factory is located on the top floor of a mall, a lot of people usually go to the floor below because it's a furniture store; plenty of couches to wait in which is convenient. Food really is a hit or miss.  First off, that brown bread they serve you is delicious. Very sweet. Their pasta with tomato sauces are usually pretty bland. My recommendation is to go with a pesto pasta. Pesto sauces are usually hard to mess up if you're a chef and are very tasty.  As for the service, I'm really beating myself up for this because I forgot our waiter's name (This was a couple months ago), but he was extremely nice. Probably one of the best waiters my girlfriend and I have ever had. He was a very young Latin looking kid. Maybe in his late teens or early 20s. I even looked for the receipt before making this review so I can find his name, but I couldn't find it. I think his name was Oscar, but I could be wrong. Give that guy a raise, please. He goes above and beyond. My girlfriend was concerned with the Union Square parking garage because it was past midnight. She asked the waiter if he knew what time the parking garage closes. He said he doesn't know, but he'll check. I thought he was just going to ask his coworkers, but he went ahead and looked for the garage's phone number and called them for detailed information.

Walking in, oh my word, those cheesecakes looked SO FLUFFY AND DELICIOUS. Came at 1:30pm, 5 minute wait for inside table, 15minutes for outside. I chose inside. Got a table at the far back corner. +Service was excellent. Very patient and understanding waiters/waitresses. ~Kind of loud inside but it was lunch time, noise is a must. +Very clean restaurant. Sat down, ordered a Crispy Crab Wonton Appetizer ($10.95). Really good. Fried very nicely. Inside was nice and warm. Dipping sauce (sweet chili sauce) accompanied it well. My entree was a Fettuccini with Chicken and Sun-Dried Tomatoes. Oh boy this was really good. Tasted like bacon, and there isn't any. A little too salty in my opinion, was grabbing for water a lot. I couldn't finish it and brought it home. Once I got home, I noticed there was a LOT of oil at the bottom. Not much of a turnoff, until I started eating and I saw a tiny piece of metal scrap in my pasta... Gross. It was a metal scrap fallen from cleaning pots and pans. Totally disgusting... Kind of sad I didn't get to try the cheesecake. Got too full but heard lots of compliments for them. It was a very pleasant afternoon. Everything was great, up until I found that metal scrap.

4421,Sunny H.,"Berkeley, United States",110,56,,3.0,2014-03-07,"For some reason, I keep finding reasons to come back here time and time again even though each experience has been very mediocre. At the end of the day, I think it's the location and the ambiance that make me want to give it another shot. This Cheesecake Factory is located at the top floor of Macy's in Union Square, affording it a really nice view of downtown San Francisco. Although it can get chilly at times, the patio is in my opinion the prime location to get the best dining experience. After all, that's the biggest differentiating factor of this specific location. Food-wise, it's very average at best. The only dish I've had here that I really enjoyed was the Chicken Piccata. I love the light flavors and the angel hair pasta in this dish. Beyond that, the other dishes I've tried as well as my friends' dishes have all been very average and don't justify the price. However, I have yet to try their famous cheesecakes so maybe that will be a game changer the next time I come here. Because of its prime location, prepare for very long wait times on the weekends. On the weekdays, small parties can usually get a seat within half an hour. Waiting in their lobby with tons of other tourists is a beast in itself, so I would recommend taking advantage of the new system they've implemented. They text you when your food is ready, which is pretty convenient because now you can shop all over Macy's and in neighboring areas while you're waiting. Overall, it's a good place to bring out of town guests or to treat yourself a little bit. If you're looking for better food, however, I would recommend trying one of the many other restaurants nearby.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=760,3.52,2.97,3.044,3.34,3.1900000000000004

1989,Dee C.,"Salinas, United States",1,14,,2.0,2014-03-08,"The reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because of the ridiculously LONG wait times and crappy customer service! The food is really good but everything else sucks!     Visited this place yesterday at about 8:00 pm and did not get seated until 10:00pm!!! I tried to make reservations but was told they do not make reservations. Decided to wait because the last time I was here, I enjoyed the food but was in a hurry to catch the baseball game so I couldn't have some cheesecake. The lady at the check in was quite rude! I was with a party of eight and was told it would be a wait which we expected. She couldn't accommodate such a large party which I find ridiculous and she couldn't guarantee we could sit together!! There was also a man in a suit walking around (manager? I don't know) he was extremely rude. We asked him for a menu to look at food choices and he said to go get it in the front and he walks away! Then we set down the menu and he takes it without asking if we were done looking at it. As he's walking away we said ""excuse me sir, we are not done with that!"" He continues on his merry way! After 2 hours, we finally get seated and that was a problem because they wanted to split up our group and sit us on opposite sides of the restaurant!!! They ended up sitting us together but it was after my husband got loud.  We sat down and didn't have enough utensils, no bread, no drinks. It took about 30 minutes to order our food!

We headed for a really late night dinner this past Thursday (after sightseeing and then resting at the hotel, 55 Park Wyndham), walking towards the place about 10:10pm. My phone gps is saying we are there, but 'saw' no Cheesecake Factory, so we walked around the block again, seeing Macy's looking closed (even though their neon sign is saying ""open tonight""). Tried calling, but no pick up after 7 rings, so decided to walk around the block again. Tried calling this time and finally someone said yes, they were open and was located upstairs..We go by that entry and finally see security guards by the elevators (no one was around the first time, so we thought our info was wrong about the location or hours), and went up. Mind you, it is now 10:25pm, and it suppose to close at 11pm.  Thinking don't think they really will close at 11pm as there were so many people still waiting, we finally get seated about 10:45pm... Wife orders soup, but waiter says don't think they have any left, but would check anyway.  I order the cuban sandwich and son orders the shepard's pie.  Bread is provided, tastes good (always like their breads), and he comes with the soup!

We headed for a really late night dinner this past Thursday (after sightseeing and then resting at the hotel, 55 Park Wyndham), walking towards the place about 10:10pm. My phone gps is saying we are there, but 'saw' no Cheesecake Factory, so we walked around the block again, seeing Macy's looking closed (even though their neon sign is saying ""open tonight""). Tried calling, but no pick up after 7 rings, so decided to walk around the block again. Tried calling this time and finally someone said yes, they were open and was located upstairs..We go by that entry and finally see security guards by the elevators (no one was around the first time, so we thought our info was wrong about the location or hours), and went up. Mind you, it is now 10:25pm, and it suppose to close at 11pm.  Thinking don't think they really will close at 11pm as there were so many people still waiting, we finally get seated about 10:45pm... Wife orders soup, but waiter says don't think they have any left, but would check anyway.  I order the cuban sandwich and son orders the shepard's pie.

I couldn't finish it and brought it home. Once I got home, I noticed there was a LOT of oil at the bottom. Not much of a turnoff, until I started eating and I saw a tiny piece of metal scrap in my pasta... Gross. It was a metal scrap fallen from cleaning pots and pans. Totally disgusting...

4333,Drea W.,"San Francisco, United States",23,59,10.0,2.0,2014-04-06,"What the FUCK is happening to San Francisco? Since being back in the Bay Area from the East Coast I've found that many of my fav places either SUCK at customer service now and/or the food is not up to my standards- of how I remember it being. I feel that that I had suggested that a new friend and I meet up here as I hadn't been to The Cheesecake Factory in years (In SF). We originally were sitting outside in which the waiter; Steven was very attentive. We asked to be seated inside as the chill began to pick up and they had not yet turned on the heated lamps and the damn pigeons were too gangsta for me! Steven sat us inside and we were introduced to a new waiter (can't recall his name) mainly because we were then given a NEW waiter AGAIN. We were about to order but a unidentified (staff member?) said: ""Hi, I'm not sure who sat you here but I have this area reserved so If you can follow me to a new place to sit"". Long story short we ended up waiting awkwardly with drinks in our hand waiting for a table to be cleared and cleaned. I began to be a little pissed. THIS PART TOOK THE CAKE. We were now introduced to Ezekiel a.k.a Zeke. He seemed a little off to begin with but I decided to ignore it. My friend and I wasn't ready to order yet as we were still trying to get situated from the numerous moves we made. I want to mention that Zeke's other tables were in front, behind, across and adjacent front us. This detail will provide to be VERY important lol So it took Zeke 20 mins to return to us to ask what had we decided on. During that time he walked by us a minimal of 3 times- taking other table orders... checking on near by diners and it wasn't until I damn near stared him down that he FINALLY came over. He took my order- my friend arrived before I did and had ordered a pasta dish outside so we didn't want to order anything else at the time. I ordered the Garlic noodles (Noodles, asparagus, garlic butter sauce, chicken (BONELESS) with tomatoes). I get this EVERY TIME I come to C.F. Plus: My friend and I got to have a LENGTHY conversation. DOWN SIDE: It took Zeke an hour to come to our table to say: ""Oh the reason it's taking so long is because the chicken is with bone and it takes longer"". I let him know that I got this dish every time and the chicken is ALWAYS boneless and I never had to request it boneless. lol WHAT THE FUCCCK!! (I screamed that in my head). He said I can rush and tell the cook to make it boneless. He tried to tell me some bullshit about a change in the menu but the item I ordered had been on the menu for EVER!!! Anywho, he went to request to have it boneless. Took 30mins (That's now damn near 1 hr 45 mins) to come with flavorless crap! I mentioned that the food was flavorless and did not have a garlic taste to it. Zeke said: ""Well, I can give you some Parmesan cheese for it- that's all I can do"". He left and I asked another waiter to get the manager; Lisa- who was VERY sympathetic. I explained everything and what really hurt was the fact that he wasn't a sucky waiter to everyone else, just to me and my friend- whom we happen to be Black and Indian. I won't say it was a racial thing but he was ATTENTIVE, WARM, BUBBLY and ACCOMMODATING to his other tables and we couldn't even get our water refilled or any damn BREAD- I LOVE THEIR BREAD lol Anywho, Tina sent his ass home!  I doubt I would go back. The face of SF is def. changing and all these changes is driving down the quality service MY City was once known for.

Ask me 10 years ago I would've rated this place 5 stars regardless of their ridiculous wait times. I called in for a price quote and availability for a red velvet cheesecake as a last minute treat for the wife's bday, the lady in the receiving end had me on hold for 10 mins. By the time I had her on the line, I asked for a quick second to ask the other half to verify the cake size, the lady asked me to call back. The wife was sitting right next to me to provide an instant response. I decided at that point there were other businesses worthy of my hard-earned dollars.  The week before, we decided to grab a quick bite during bridesmaid dress shopping. Not having dined here for years, the quality in the food has gone down drastically. I had the ahi tuna salad, she had some chicken pasta dish - both were unremarkable. I suppose these were good reminders as to why we've stayed away from this establishment.

It was a bit disappointing, but we were going to make the best of it. Six of us squeeze into one table, the remaining four sat behind us.  Our waiter was awesome!! I wish I caught his name. He was really friendly and funny and gave good recommendations.  I [think] i ordered the louisiana pasta (or something like that). It was really yummy and full of flavor.

3601,J. H.,"Oakland, CA",6,11,7.0,3.0,2014-04-11,"I would rate this place 5 stars or more for the occasion and the memories, but I cannot. Came to this restaurant around the first week of January. This was one of the first places I went to for my first date with my boyfriend, and it was quite a memorable night. We talk about it a lot til this day and look forward to coming back again (When he graduates and hopefully finds a job here *fingers crossed*) On with the review though, and less with the cheese. ____ The Wait: Can't talk about the Cheesecake Factory in Union Square without mentioning the wait! It's almost like a strange conversational blasphemy...Gotta talk about the wait. Let's just say it's the kind of wait where, you have to go window shopping just to kill the time. If the person at the front desk says 30 min, they mean 30 min and maybe a few after. If they say an hour, they mean an hour. They provide you with one of those portable electronic ringers to let you know your seat is ready. Just be patient. We had to wait an hour and some minutes, which was fine with us because it gave us time to window shop (don't buy anything in Union Square unless you make a six figure salary, seriously. What are you? A wallet serial killer?) and walk about downtown. Even explore the huge Macy's store. Sofas are conveniently placed next to the restaurant's entrance if you don't plan on walking anywhere to kill time. If they've moved it by the time you read this review: sorry bud. Your couch is in another floor. (Mario reference was intentional). ____ The Service: Service was great in my opinion. I didn't have any rude service. The people at front desk had to raise their voice almost to yell to inform us of stuff over the crowd, so don't take it as them being rude. They're just trying to do their job. Our waiter was a very cheery gay man who was very funny and checked in on us at appropriate times. He didn't check in on us excessively which was very kind of him. He was available to us whenever we needed him though. Wish I remembered his name! But wherever you are dude, you're great. Keep it up. ___ The Atmosphere: We sat on the balcony part and it can get a bit chilly yes, but they got space heaters for that and we were placed conveniently next to it. Nice fancy atmosphere. A bit dark on the inside, but it sets the date mood. Great view of the city at night and very clean and nice. Very crowded though. As soon as you get to the restaurant via escalators, you'll notice how loud it is. It's a popular place though, so don't be surprised. ___ The Food: I can't remember 100% what we ordered. I just know my boyfriend got a pizza, I got some sort of chicken pesto tomato garlic pasta, and we got vanilla bean cheesecake. Let's just say pasta is not this restaurants forte. I'll mention the bad first then the good. -Cons: You could tell the pasta was made with canned tomatoes, poorly chopped up garlic and boxed pasta. The chicken was very dry too and the plate overall tasted pre-made. The pasta was not boiled well, because I had some half cooked noodles and some over cooked noodles. It was a mixture of both. The sauce had way too much garlic and not enough flavor. It tasted like watered down tomatoes and that it came straight from a can. I felt like there wasn't a lot of love put into my dish. The portion was very big, which I didn't mind. Overall, the dish could have been done better if each part was cooked well. -Pros: The pizza was great. It was yummy warm and flavorful. The crust was thin but still crunchy and not stale. I wish I ordered the pizza instead of pasta, because I found myself eating off the same plate as my boyfriend more than my own.  The cheesecake was the star of the show. We were very full but we still wanted to eat all of the cheesecake, but we had to save it. Even after saving it in a box, it still tasted delicious. The vanilla was fragrant and just the right amount of sweetness. The cheesecake was very airy but sweet and delightful. The whip cream was whipped to the right consistency and I felt like I was eating sweet clouds in my mouth. A nice light cheesecake, not full of a lot of strong flavors but it was juuuust right. Probably the best cheesecake I had in my life so far. I look forward to trying more from there next time.  ___ Other comments:  Not much besides go for the cheesecakes. Every other dish is kind of questionable. If you want to take someone on a date, this is one of those places to put on your list. I miss this place, and we'll come back for it on another date. I'll order something other than the pasta though.

They had like a hundred different flavors of cheesecake, and actually really decent and yummy food. In recent years though, the crowds have become way ridiculous and it looks like they're starting to cut corners on all the recipes I used to love. They just ain't that great anymore. WAIT TIMES: We dropped by the Cheesecake Factory on Black Friday (on hindsight, not the best idea) and were seated after a 45 minute wait. They have a nifty little system where they text you a few minutes before your turn so you can do some shopping while you wait, which is nice. The servers though, are totally snobby and rude, but I guess they can afford to be since there are 1283719 more customers willing to take your place if you dare to complain. FOOD: Sigh. This is where it all went down hill.  Normally, I would be happy to wait for a plate of Cheesecake Factory's signature delicious garlic noodles. That garlicky flavorful butter sauce, piled high on al dente spaghetti? Delicious. Droolworthy. Amazing. Dare I say it? One of the best plates of American spaghetti I have ever had. This time though, the garlic spaghetti sauce was terribly diluted, it looked like sad egg noodles in watery soup, and tasted just about as bad. So bummed that they would do that to such an amazing recipe! Is that only true of this branch? Do the other branches serve it in all its original glory? I really need to know! We also ordered a bowl of guacamole - which was pretty pricey, but generous in portion. Unfortunately, the guacamole was seriously underseasoned and lack luster. Bummer. The standout of the meal was definitely the tuna tartare piled high on mashed avocados. It was really delicious. All in all, an expensive and disappointing experience.

After that was done, we waited and waited for what seemed like 20 minutes until we actually received our waters and basket of bread.  This rating mostly has to do with the service we received today.

We arrived at about 5:45PM and they told us we had a one hour and 25 minute wait!!! Yeah, why would they ever take reservations. The hoards of people waiting in the foyer were ridiculous. After finally getting seated, my wife went to use their restroom. She said it was flooded and there was pee all over the place - so bad that she had to straddle the toilet to go. I used the men's restroom after dinner and while it wasn't as bad, there was pee all over the seat and floor as well. Just pathetic. The service was good and our waiters seemed very attentive. However, I ordered a ceasar salad, one of the larger ones and when I got it, there was hardly any dressing on it and ""one"" crouton. If I wanted to order just a head of lettuce, I would have. My wife's salad had hardly any dressing on it as well. The steak I ordered was supposed to be cooked medium and it was so rare and undercooked, I had to poke it to see if it was still alive. I asked our waiter and they took it back to re-cook it. When they came back 15 minutes or so later, they forgot to return the knife and fork and I had to wait another 5+ minutes before I could get someone to get me a new one.

My friend invited three more people to the party (they haven't yet arrived). So, we waved to a waitress and asked if it's possible to maybe arrange seating for us to sit down at another area for a larger party. The waitress then rudely goes ""Oh, you can just go ask the host.""  Not that we don't have legs, arms, or that we cannot physically go ask the host ourselves. However, as an etiquette, at least OFFER nicely and say things like ""I'm actually not sure if I can personally arrange that for you, but, let me go ask the host for you."" Nope. She didn't, she just left us hangin'. We also asked if we could order and she told us that we need to wait for our own waitress...UM. OKAY.

Anyway, we ended up dining with just four people and was able to calm down because our waitress was pretty funny and somewhat lightened up the mood for us. Appetizers we got included the Tex Mex Eggrolls, Factory Nachos, Crispy Crab Wontons, and Buffalo Blasts. So much for healthy, everything was fried food, haha! We also got for dessert Tiramisu Cheesecake, and Strawberry Cheesecake. Both were average I would say. I favored the Factory Nachos a lot more over the others.

Obligatory visit as I'm entertaining out-of-country friends from Thailand. Cheesecake Factory makes prefect sense after their full-day of looting Macy's and the Union Square shops. The name says it all---Cheesecake Factory---known for their cheesecakes and they don't disappoint.  Monday evening at 6 there's already a wait of 10-15 minutes. For party of 4+ everyone has to be present in order to be seated. The wait for the patio seating is usually longer when it's nice out. It was nice sitting by the windows so my friends would enjoy the view of Union Square. Food is bland and mediocre at best. We all decided to ""down-size"" our dinner portions to make room for the cheesecakes.  Moscow Mule is a mango-flavored twist and that's the only Moscow Mule they could make. It was alright, more fruity than fizzy. Cosmopolitan is disappointingly weak. I couldn't taste any vodka. My friends had bottled beers. I don't remember ever having a tasty cocktail here. :/ Thai Lettuce Wraps quite tasty with a sweet chili sauce and a peanut dip. Mozzarella-basil-tomato flatbread is good , thin-crusted served on a wooden skillet. Pasta Da Vinci is a penne with grilled chicken and mushrooms in a light creamy white wine sauce. It's completely lacking flavor. I had to sprinkle a lot of salt to it. Teriyaki Chicken on Brown Rice is okay, with a sweet-tasting glaze.  All four cheesecakes are STELLAR: Snickers, Lemon Raspberry, Godiva Chocolate, and Red Velvet. All over the top and we licked all the plates clean. The Snickers one is really plain cheesecake with crunched Snickers bar on top. The Godiva cheesecake is has a stronger taste of chocolate than cheesecake. This is it if you like chocolate. The Red Velvet is a mixture of plain cheesecake and velvet cake. Overall the food is just mediocre, hit-or-miss. Skip the cocktails and have them instead at Bar Drake or Dirty Habit at the Palomar Hotel.

3354,Drea W.,"San Francisco, CA",23,59,10.0,2.0,2014-06-04,"What the FUCK is happening to San Francisco? Since being back in the Bay Area from the East Coast I've found that many of my fav places either SUCK at customer service now and/or the food is not up to my standards- of how I remember it being. I feel that that I had suggested that a new friend and I meet up here as I hadn't been to The Cheesecake Factory in years (In SF). We originally were sitting outside in which the waiter; Steven was very attentive. We asked to be seated inside as the chill began to pick up and they had not yet turned on the heated lamps and the damn pigeons were too gangsta for me! Steven sat us inside and we were introduced to a new waiter (can't recall his name) mainly because we were then given a NEW waiter AGAIN. We were about to order but a unidentified (staff member?) said: ""Hi, I'm not sure who sat you here but I have this area reserved so If you can follow me to a new place to sit"". Long story short we ended up waiting awkwardly with drinks in our hand waiting for a table to be cleared and cleaned. I began to be a little pissed. THIS PART TOOK THE CAKE. We were now introduced to Ezekiel a.k.a Zeke. He seemed a little off to begin with but I decided to ignore it. My friend and I wasn't ready to order yet as we were still trying to get situated from the numerous moves we made. I want to mention that Zeke's other tables were in front, behind, across and adjacent front us. This detail will provide to be VERY important lol So it took Zeke 20 mins to return to us to ask what had we decided on. During that time he walked by us a minimal of 3 times- taking other table orders... checking on near by diners and it wasn't until I damn near stared him down that he FINALLY came over. He took my order- my friend arrived before I did and had ordered a pasta dish outside so we didn't want to order anything else at the time. I ordered the Garlic noodles (Noodles, asparagus, garlic butter sauce, chicken (BONELESS) with tomatoes). I get this EVERY TIME I come to C.F. Plus: My friend and I got to have a LENGTHY conversation. DOWN SIDE: It took Zeke an hour to come to our table to say: ""Oh the reason it's taking so long is because the chicken is with bone and it takes longer"". I let him know that I got this dish every time and the chicken is ALWAYS boneless and I never had to request it boneless. lol WHAT THE FUCCCK!! (I screamed that in my head). He said I can rush and tell the cook to make it boneless. He tried to tell me some bullshit about a change in the menu but the item I ordered had been on the menu for EVER!!! Anywho, he went to request to have it boneless. Took 30mins (That's now damn near 1 hr 45 mins) to come with flavorless crap! I mentioned that the food was flavorless and did not have a garlic taste to it. Zeke said: ""Well, I can give you some Parmesan cheese for it- that's all I can do"". He left and I asked another waiter to get the manager; Lisa- who was VERY sympathetic. I explained everything and what really hurt was the fact that he wasn't a sucky waiter to everyone else, just to me and my friend- whom we happen to be Black and Indian. I won't say it was a racial thing but he was ATTENTIVE, WARM, BUBBLY and ACCOMMODATING to his other tables and we couldn't even get our water refilled or any damn BREAD- I LOVE THEIR BREAD lol Anywho, Tina sent his ass home!  I doubt I would go back. The face of SF is def. changing and all these changes is driving down the quality service MY City was once known for. If I want sucky-rude waiters, I might as well move back to the East Coast.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=720,2.48,3.23,3.132,2.9200000000000004,2.9299999999999997

The food was not good at all, the pork chops were so overcooked and dry, its plating was wrong, no applesauce, over salted spinach and mashed potatoes.  Shepards pie was served with a pool of oil on its surface.  We know that Cheesecake Factory isn't the healthiest but the pool of oil was disgusting, couldn't even get it to go to give to a homeless person it was so nasty.  Jamaican Black Pepper shrimp came with 5 pieces of shrimp for $19.95.   We've had these dishes in the past so we know how good they can be when cooked properly. The only saving grace for the night was a slice of smores cheesecake. Service is spotty, you have to wave down anyone that comes by if you need something, don't know if waiters are being given too many tables.  The restaurant itself is showing it's age, dining tables and chairs and floors need to be replaced as well as the chipped dishes!

3262,Sunny H.,"Berkeley, CA",110,56,,3.0,2014-07-03,"For some reason, I keep finding reasons to come back here time and time again even though each experience has been very mediocre. At the end of the day, I think it's the location and the ambiance that make me want to give it another shot. This Cheesecake Factory is located at the top floor of Macy's in Union Square, affording it a really nice view of downtown San Francisco. Although it can get chilly at times, the patio is in my opinion the prime location to get the best dining experience. After all, that's the biggest differentiating factor of this specific location. Food-wise, it's very average at best. The only dish I've had here that I really enjoyed was the Chicken Piccata. I love the light flavors and the angel hair pasta in this dish. Beyond that, the other dishes I've tried as well as my friends' dishes have all been very average and don't justify the price. However, I have yet to try their famous cheesecakes so maybe that will be a game changer the next time I come here. Because of its prime location, prepare for very long wait times on the weekends. On the weekdays, small parties can usually get a seat within half an hour. Waiting in their lobby with tons of other tourists is a beast in itself, so I would recommend taking advantage of the new system they've implemented. They text you when your food is ready, which is pretty convenient because now you can shop all over Macy's and in neighboring areas while you're waiting. Overall, it's a good place to bring out of town guests or to treat yourself a little bit. If you're looking for better food, however, I would recommend trying one of the many other restaurants nearby.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=760,3.2,3.07,3.084,2.8280000000000003,3.122

By the time I had her on the line, I asked for a quick second to ask the other half to verify the cake size, the lady asked me to call back. The wife was sitting right next to me to provide an instant response. I decided at that point there were other businesses worthy of my hard-earned dollars.  The week before, we decided to grab a quick bite during bridesmaid dress shopping. Not having dined here for years, the quality in the food has gone down drastically.

We came here yesterday with a party of 4 for Fourth of July late night dinner/snacks and was dining outside on the roof area. My friend invited three more people to the party (they haven't yet arrived). So, we waved to a waitress and asked if it's possible to maybe arrange seating for us to sit down at another area for a larger party. The waitress then rudely goes ""Oh, you can just go ask the host.""  Not that we don't have legs, arms, or that we cannot physically go ask the host ourselves. However, as an etiquette, at least OFFER nicely and say things like ""I'm actually not sure if I can personally arrange that for you, but, let me go ask the host for you."" Nope. She didn't, she just left us hangin'. We also asked if we could order and she told us that we need to wait for our own waitress...UM. OKAY. We don't want to talk to you anyway....-__-"" I'm a host at a restaurant; hence, why I feel like it's necessary to complain about this type of situation because come on, that's extremely rude for an environment like Cheesecake Factory! (Not that I've experienced better service before here...and the wait here is just ridiculous in general...) Anyway, we ended up dining with just four people and was able to calm down because our waitress was pretty funny and somewhat lightened up the mood for us. Appetizers we got included the Tex Mex Eggrolls, Factory Nachos, Crispy Crab Wontons, and Buffalo Blasts. So much for healthy, everything was fried food, haha! We also got for dessert Tiramisu Cheesecake, and Strawberry Cheesecake. Both were average I would say. I favored the Factory Nachos a lot more over the others. It was not as greasy and oily as the Buffalo Blasts and Eggrolls, but it was worth a try.  Overall, Cheesecake Factory's food was mediocre, and I hope they'll learn to improve their customer service a little bit better because I'm out of here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=480,3.24,3.04,3.092,2.8560000000000003,3.1200000000000006

I typically like the cheesecake factory, only because it is super family friendly and makes outtings easy with so many options and big portions that you can share. The quality of the food and taste is chain like totally mediocre, not the greatest when you are in SF. There are way better places to eat. I rated this one a two star because it is beyond loud in there, you know when you can't hear the person next to you kind of loud.

After being told her cake would only take 10 minutes and waiting for more than 30, she tried to ask the staff how much longer she would need to wait. At this point the woman behind the counter, Allie (Aly?), simply brushed her off and said that they were too busy. She then ignored my girlfriend's follow-up questions and acted very condescending. My girlfriend was not born in America and English is not her first language, so she politely asked the staff to repeat themselves so she could better understand. This was met with further rudeness. At this point, my girlfriend called me over and the woman's entire attitude changed once she saw me. She was suddenly very apologetic and attempted to be accommodating. We finally got our cake and left after ensuring that they would take action for the shitty attitude. Be aware of racist staff at The Cheesecake Factory.

The issues in short: -The escalator gate from the 7th floor of Macys to Cheesecake is closed, leaving a 5-10 minute wait just to get on the elevator to and from the restaurant.  -No organization whatsoever. There is no system here. -They ring up 100 people at the to-go line and no cheesecakes come out for 15 minutes. They then prepare the cheesecakes all at one time and get confused on who ordered what. You have to go up to them and point out what cheesecakes you ordered. I could have stolen all the cheesecakes and they wouldn't even know.  Bottom line is you should never come here if you're hungry.

Obligatory visit as I'm entertaining out-of-country friends from Thailand. Cheesecake Factory makes prefect sense after their full-day of looting Macy's and the Union Square shops. The name says it all---Cheesecake Factory---known for their cheesecakes and they don't disappoint.  Monday evening at 6 there's already a wait of 10-15 minutes. For party of 4+ everyone has to be present in order to be seated. The wait for the patio seating is usually longer when it's nice out. It was nice sitting by the windows so my friends would enjoy the view of Union Square. Food is bland and mediocre at best. We all decided to ""down-size"" our dinner portions to make room for the cheesecakes.  Moscow Mule is a mango-flavored twist and that's the only Moscow Mule they could make. It was alright, more fruity than fizzy. Cosmopolitan is disappointingly weak. I couldn't taste any vodka. My friends had bottled beers. I don't remember ever having a tasty cocktail here. :/ Thai Lettuce Wraps quite tasty with a sweet chili sauce and a peanut dip. Mozzarella-basil-tomato flatbread is good , thin-crusted served on a wooden skillet. Pasta Da Vinci is a penne with grilled chicken and mushrooms in a light creamy white wine sauce. It's completely lacking flavor. I had to sprinkle a lot of salt to it. Teriyaki Chicken on Brown Rice is okay, with a sweet-tasting glaze.  All four cheesecakes are STELLAR: Snickers, Lemon Raspberry, Godiva Chocolate, and Red Velvet. All over the top and we licked all the plates clean. The Snickers one is really plain cheesecake with crunched Snickers bar on top. The Godiva cheesecake is has a stronger taste of chocolate than cheesecake. This is it if you like chocolate. The Red Velvet is a mixture of plain cheesecake and velvet cake. Overall the food is just mediocre, hit-or-miss.

In the Fall/Winter you can gaze down on the ice skaters in Union Square. Reserving a table: Chaos! Send someone along early to put your name in, especially on a Saturday night. Wait times can exceed 90 minutes to 2 hours! There is virtually no place to wait around near the front desk and it is a free for all to get to the desk to even put in your reservation.

So I have been coming to this Cheesecake Factory for awhile now only because nothing else is close enough to me. But I never do yelp reviews but I seriously can't stand the service here! From the waiters to the hosts to the managers. Worst customer service I've ever had. You would think they would treat their customers with respect and have the decency to at least say excuse me while they all bump into you when they walk by. I'm not exaggerating every time I've been here nothing but rude service I can't stand it anymore. Last time my friend and I sat outside we were waiting there for 90 minutes (not exaggerating) we spoke to 4 waiters and the manager Chris and still no help. They don't care about the guests here at all. They are impatient and have no respect. They don't even hide how miserable they are with their facial expressions. And also they too their eyes at you and ignore you. Another time I came I spoke to the host I front saying how long I was waiting, he then proceeded to laugh in my face and said ""I'm sure you have"".

This Cheesecake Factory is very conveniently located near Union Square and Westfield Mall and the Powell Bart station.

Not much to review here - the portions are as big as any other Cheesecake Factory and the food is consistently as good as any other. The service is also quite good. So for that reason, I'm giving 3-Stars, the same as my other Cheesecake Factory review.  So what makes this restaurant different than other Cheesecake Factories? Well for starters, the view from this restaurant of Union Square if you sit outside at the ledge is awesome at night. It's very pretty looking down at all the people in Union Square. Keep in mind you are 8 floors up. Many people enjoy taking pictures up here with the setting/view in the background and I completely understand why :))). I was one of them, shhhh.  What else makes this one different? THE LINE. This Cheesecake Factory has the longest waits to get a table of any one that I have ever been to.

My boyfriend, his mom, and I were in the city for the weekend and decided to eat here at the Cheesecake Factory, rather than the pier (where we really wanted to go), but we didn't want to drive over and find parking again. It all started when we checked in with the hostesses for 3 people. They gave us a buzzer for a wait of 15-20 minutes. We are pretty patient people but it came to a point where my boyfriend had to ask if we were going to be seated soon. We ended up sitting outside, which we didn't mind - because it was very warm inside. I thought the view was beautiful, but all the birds flying around and swooping other people's food was quite a show. My boyfriend who is terrified of birds didn't enjoy our seat but we did say that we didn't mind sitting in or out. We even saw a bird fly into their glass doors! All you heard was a loud THUD. Lol! We ordered the spinach and cheese dip for an appetizer. The portion looked amazing because we were starving to death. (Just kidding, but you get it.)

When we got it back, it just looked like they added more to it and it tasted like more cheese. Personally, it just needed to be seasoned with salt and pepper. When we seasoned it ourselves, it tasted a thousand times better. Maybe they were lacking in seasoning their food? I don't know. My boyfriend ordered the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp and that tasted amazing as always! We both love that dish. I ordered the Garlic Noodles. I seriously had high hopes for this because again, I was seriously so hungry! When my food arrived, I was ready to dig in until I flipped my chicken... I FOUND A HAIR.

We put down our names and the host told us it'll be about a 2 hour wait. We figured this would happen so others sat around chatting while some of us went to the bar to get some drinks. About an hour in, we went back up to the host stand and they told us it'll be another 45 minutes. Okay. Cool. We'll be seated sooner than expected. Again, others went to the bar and some went outside to enjoy the pleasant evening, taking in Union Square. When the 45 minutes were up, the host told us it'll be 2 hours. There was no way the party wanted to wait another 2 hours; we were hungry at this point. After explaining that we've been there since 6, the lady retracted her statement saying it'll be 10 minutes; they are cleaning up our table right now. Luckily, we were seated before we decided to go elsewhere. The waitress was friendly and took in our orders. She also helped in accommodating our tardy guest, who didn't think they'd be able to make it on time. We ordered drinks and was  delivered to our table almost instantaneously. Our food came in 30 minutes later, and she came around the table every once in awhile to check on our food and add more drink orders.

We had to wait an hour and some minutes, which was fine with us because it gave us time to window shop (don't buy anything in Union Square unless you make a six figure salary, seriously. What are you? A wallet serial killer?) and walk about downtown. Even explore the huge Macy's store. Sofas are conveniently placed next to the restaurant's entrance if you don't plan on walking anywhere to kill time. If they've moved it by the time you read this review: sorry bud. Your couch is in another floor. (Mario reference was intentional). ____ The Service: Service was great in my opinion. I didn't have any rude service. The people at front desk had to raise their voice almost to yell to inform us of stuff over the crowd, so don't take it as them being rude. They're just trying to do their job. Our waiter was a very cheery gay man who was very funny and checked in on us at appropriate times. He didn't check in on us excessively which was very kind of him. He was available to us whenever we needed him though. Wish I remembered his name! But wherever you are dude, you're great. Keep it up. ___ The Atmosphere: We sat on the balcony part and it can get a bit chilly yes, but they got space heaters for that and we were placed conveniently next to it. Nice fancy atmosphere. A bit dark on the inside, but it sets the date mood. Great view of the city at night and very clean and nice. Very crowded though. As soon as you get to the restaurant via escalators, you'll notice how loud it is. It's a popular place though, so don't be surprised. ___ The Food: I can't remember 100% what we ordered. I just know my boyfriend got a pizza, I got some sort of chicken pesto tomato garlic pasta, and we got vanilla bean cheesecake. Let's just say pasta is not this restaurants forte. I'll mention the bad first then the good. -Cons: You could tell the pasta was made with canned tomatoes, poorly chopped up garlic and boxed pasta. The chicken was very dry too and the plate overall tasted pre-made. The pasta was not boiled well, because I had some half cooked noodles and some over cooked noodles. It was a mixture of both. The sauce had way too much garlic and not enough flavor. It tasted like watered down tomatoes and that it came straight from a can. I felt like there wasn't a lot of love put into my dish. The portion was very big, which I didn't mind. Overall, the dish could have been done better if each part was cooked well. -Pros: The pizza was great. It was yummy warm and flavorful. The crust was thin but still crunchy and not stale. I wish I ordered the pizza instead of pasta, because I found myself eating off the same plate as my boyfriend more than my own.  The cheesecake was the star of the show. We were very full but we still wanted to eat all of the cheesecake, but we had to save it. Even after saving it in a box, it still tasted delicious. The vanilla was fragrant and just the right amount of sweetness. The cheesecake was very airy but sweet and delightful. The whip cream was whipped to the right consistency and I felt like I was eating sweet clouds in my mouth. A nice light cheesecake, not full of a lot of strong flavors but it was juuuust right. Probably the best cheesecake I had in my life so far. I look forward to trying more from there next time.  ___ Other comments:  Not much besides go for the cheesecakes. Every other dish is kind of questionable. If you want to take someone on a date, this is one of those places to put on your list. I miss this place, and we'll come back for it on another date. I'll order something other than the pasta though.

Got there around 14h and waited  half an hour to be seated. We orderd our meals and they were on our table in the next 30 minutes. I orderd pizza with grilled chiken, pesto and 3 diffrent types of chees without peppers. When i got my pizza it look kind of strange but i took a bite. I ve called for a waiter to check te menu  and ingredients again because i was convinced i was not eating chicken.  It turned out i was right. I got the wrong pizza. WITH PORK!!! Wich i don t eat since i am a Muslim. I was really upset. The waiter came and said i did get the wrong pizza and brought the chicken pizza i have orderd but with peppers. WRONG AGAIN!  Manager came and appologize. Asked if i wanted another pizza and that i will not be charged for that. Ofcourse i said No. Iwas emotionaly hurt but they did not get that. They were realy rude and did not show any regret.  When we got our bill , everything was there just not my pizza. We did not get anything. not a discount not a complementary cake, nothing... Just a ruined afternoon for me. I was really really hurt because it was a big deal for me and they did not care a bit. Never ever going back!

Because it is a hot tourist spot, the place was already packed, and the wait was around 40 minutes at 4pm.

How people manage to eat a slice for dessert after a meal is beyond me.  - Service: F for Fail. Our server was rude, impatient, and inattentive.

So I have been coming to this Cheesecake Factory for awhile now only because nothing else is close enough to me. But I never do yelp reviews but I seriously can't stand the service here! From the waiters to the hosts to the managers. Worst customer service I've ever had. You would think they would treat their customers with respect and have the decency to at least say excuse me while they all bump into you when they walk by. I'm not exaggerating every time I've been here nothing but rude service I can't stand it anymore. Last time my friend and I sat outside we were waiting there for 90 minutes (not exaggerating) we spoke to 4 waiters and the manager Chris and still no help. They don't care about the guests here at all. They are impatient and have no respect. They don't even hide how miserable they are with their facial expressions. And also they too their eyes at you and ignore you.

First things first, be aware of the wait times, don't come in during the weekend expecting to get seated right away, it's in one of the busiest areas of SF.  Parking can be a hassle, but there's parking across the street or down a few blocks near Westfield Mall that may be even cheaper. If you're here with friends or on a date do a combined Cheesecake factory and go ice skating. Ice skating gets a bit packed, but lots of photo-ops in the square itself!  From the start if you're here at night get a seat outside and enjoy the view from down below it's amazing!  If you're a tourist, double dating, going on a date, or just enjoying Union Square come here.  I came here with my boyfriend and a girlfriend of mine with her boy. If you're in a group it's a great atmosphere to be in. Unfortunately the wait is long if you come during the weekend.  We came on a Friday night and knew from the get go it would be at least an hour wait.  It seems after about 6:30, the wait gets longer than an hour.  My boyfriend and I got there earlier than my girlfriend and her guy so we were going to put our name in at 6 but the wait was only about 30 minutes so we waited since we weren't sure if our friends would be there in 30 min, came back 30 minutes later and had a 75 minute wait. Yikes!  Regardless, we chatted downstairs in the furniture section (very smartly placed for people to sit down and relax while waiting forever).  Our waitress was nice.  Very personable which probably comes from serving people who come from all over the country to this place.   Unfortunately for my group our food wasn't that great for some reason.  It seems my girlfriend and her guy's food was fine (pastas and appetizers), but my boyfriend's food was cold. I don't mean a little warm, lukewarm--it was cold. Eating a cold Steak Diane is not very appealing.  His mushrooms in his dish were cold as well, as if the dish had been waiting there forever.

The macaroni cheese balls were okay, a little too much cream for me.  Crab cakes were yummy, coffee would have been better if it was actually hot and not awkwardly lukewarm.   The lemon meringue cheesecake was good though. I'd be pretty upset if I didn't enjoy the cheesecake considering I'm at the cheesecake factory.  Overall the experience was enjoyable for the company, but our food was meh.

OKAY OKAY OKAY... it's not exactly a michelin star franchise, but for what it is, it's FIVE STARS. It's the bread, the butter, the HUMUNGOUS selection of desserts, appetizers, entrees, drinks, etc etc etc... endless selection of every culture and all wrapped up in a great setting. The view at the very top of SF Macy's building is outstanding, ESPECIALLY during the holidays. The huge tree right smack in the middle of Union Square, the lightings and decorations during the day and darky nights... all of it... I want to infuse my mind and body with all that I can possibly consume with my eyes. The service is soooo ridiculously attentive, and super duper nice. I don't care if they're paid to solely kiss my ass with fake smiles, and 'what else do you need miss?' WHY? Because sometimes a girl just wants to dine and feel nothing but bliss bliss bliss.  The wait is long, but when you're in Macy's with a beeper that will notify you when it's your turn to plug yourself in the Cheesecake Factory Circus of FUN, you can travel via the escalators and just browse with interest, and for me, not with intent to purchase, but just to see with glee. What I love to eat during my special plug in slot time at the tempting layers of choices given at Cheesecake Factory, are the crispy cold caesar salad with gunks of chunky raw garlic, and the chicken lettuce wraps with the three dips. Also, the cheesy dips that act like fondue are spectacular. I always ask for fresh chunky tomato salsa to add a cold refreshing factor to this hot cheesy dip.

215,Hannah Y.,"Oakland, CA",5,106,730.0,5.0,2014-11-25,"YES YES YESSSS. I love Cheesecake Factory. OKAY OKAY OKAY... it's not exactly a michelin star franchise, but for what it is, it's FIVE STARS. It's the bread, the butter, the HUMUNGOUS selection of desserts, appetizers, entrees, drinks, etc etc etc... endless selection of every culture and all wrapped up in a great setting. The view at the very top of SF Macy's building is outstanding, ESPECIALLY during the holidays. The huge tree right smack in the middle of Union Square, the lightings and decorations during the day and darky nights... all of it... I want to infuse my mind and body with all that I can possibly consume with my eyes. The service is soooo ridiculously attentive, and super duper nice. I don't care if they're paid to solely kiss my ass with fake smiles, and 'what else do you need miss?' WHY? Because sometimes a girl just wants to dine and feel nothing but bliss bliss bliss.  The wait is long, but when you're in Macy's with a beeper that will notify you when it's your turn to plug yourself in the Cheesecake Factory Circus of FUN, you can travel via the escalators and just browse with interest, and for me, not with intent to purchase, but just to see with glee. What I love to eat during my special plug in slot time at the tempting layers of choices given at Cheesecake Factory, are the crispy cold caesar salad with gunks of chunky raw garlic, and the chicken lettuce wraps with the three dips. Also, the cheesy dips that act like fondue are spectacular. I always ask for fresh chunky tomato salsa to add a cold refreshing factor to this hot cheesy dip.

They had like a hundred different flavors of cheesecake, and actually really decent and yummy food. In recent years though, the crowds have become way ridiculous and it looks like they're starting to cut corners on all the recipes I used to love. They just ain't that great anymore. WAIT TIMES: We dropped by the Cheesecake Factory on Black Friday (on hindsight, not the best idea) and were seated after a 45 minute wait. They have a nifty little system where they text you a few minutes before your turn so you can do some shopping while you wait, which is nice. The servers though, are totally snobby and rude, but I guess they can afford to be since there are 1283719 more customers willing to take your place if you dare to complain. FOOD: Sigh. This is where it all went down hill.  Normally, I would be happy to wait for a plate of Cheesecake Factory's signature delicious garlic noodles. That garlicky flavorful butter sauce, piled high on al dente spaghetti? Delicious. Droolworthy. Amazing. Dare I say it? One of the best plates of American spaghetti I have ever had. This time though, the garlic spaghetti sauce was terribly diluted, it looked like sad egg noodles in watery soup, and tasted just about as bad. So bummed that they would do that to such an amazing recipe! Is that only true of this branch? Do the other branches serve it in all its original glory? I really need to know! We also ordered a bowl of guacamole - which was pretty pricey, but generous in portion. Unfortunately, the guacamole was seriously underseasoned and lack luster. Bummer. The standout of the meal was definitely the tuna tartare piled high on mashed avocados. It was really delicious. All in all, an expensive and disappointing experience.

1664,Cands W.,"San Jose, United States",270,25,2.0,4.0,2014-12-27,"I think a lot of people give low ratings to the Cheesecake Factory because of the wait time. We ate there the day after Christmas so it was extremely busy. Our wait time was 1.5 to 2 hours for a table of 4 so if you plan on eating there, reserve ahead of time! (Just a heads up: they do not accept reservations over the phone. You have to reserve your table in person.) It wasn't a big deal to me because the restaurant is located basically in Macy's so we spent our wait time shopping!  Customer service is really good and the food was really good too! All the portions are huge though so if you don't like to eat too much, I would recommend sharing your meal with someone. All the dishes are pretty expensive but I believe it was worth it! :D If you go in the winter time, I suggest that you try outdoor seating. We opted out of it because we thought it was going to be too cold. However, they have heat lamps outside and it was not even one bit cold!

2639,Cands W.,"San Jose, CA",270,25,2.0,4.0,2014-12-27,"I think a lot of people give low ratings to the Cheesecake Factory because of the wait time. We ate there the day after Christmas so it was extremely busy. Our wait time was 1.5 to 2 hours for a table of 4 so if you plan on eating there, reserve ahead of time! (Just a heads up: they do not accept reservations over the phone. You have to reserve your table in person.) It wasn't a big deal to me because the restaurant is located basically in Macy's so we spent our wait time shopping!  Customer service is really good and the food was really good too! All the portions are huge though so if you don't like to eat too much, I would recommend sharing your meal with someone. All the dishes are pretty expensive but I believe it was worth it! :D If you go in the winter time, I suggest that you try outdoor seating. We opted out of it because we thought it was going to be too cold. However, they have heat lamps outside and it was not even one bit cold!

It's your typical run of the mill chain establishment albeit a bit more upscale with a myriad of menu options. This one in San Francisco however, offers that city by the bay nostalgia. The outdoor balcony offers an excellent ambience, especially in the winter when you can overlook Union Square's beautiful and massive Christmas tree and the ice skating mishaps. The heat lamps help keep the cold at bay, but if that doesn't keep you warm there's a variety of alcoholic beverages on the drink menu to warm you up and put some hair on your chest.  The only reason why I've given this one 3 stars is because you can never eat here without at least a 45 minute wait for indoor or outdoor seating. Also, the bar ran out of Asian pear martinis, Mai Tais, and Moscow Mules. Really, 0 for 3!?!  If your in a hurry and it doesn't mean that much to you to sit outside, it's best to wait near the bar and grab a seat once one becomes available.

I've been a loyal customer for 12+ years now, as long as I could go out by myself with my friends! In high school, I came to this restaurant to celebrate countless birthdays, ""fancy"" dinners, and would spend an occasional ""splurge"" on a dinner. Mind you, I was a teenager and money was scarce.  As time passed, I've seen the decline in food and subtle changes that ""crunched the numbers"". They are very minuscule, but it goes to show the restaurant is trying to decrease expenses and increase profit. With every business, this is the main goal. Disclosure: I am not disagreeing with the changes, but rather just stating my observations.  1. The bread: Basket with linen cloth napkin that kept the bread warm. Now, it is served exposed and in a white disposable napkin. (less dirty napkins) 2. Butter: Butter is no longer in a separate bowl. It is nestled and squeezed between breads. (less dishes) 3. Silverware: Before, placed in linen napkins. Now, silverware is on the supposedly clean table. (less time preparing the silverware bundles) Beyond the subtle changes, is the quality of food. We go to restaurants and occasionally order the same ""go-to"" dish, right? Well yes, I've ordered the Pasta Da Vinci 19/20 times, approximately. It's something that I've always looked forward to and didn't mind waiting 45+ minutes to get. The buttery, wine, caramelized onions, mushroom sauce over penne pasta was my favorite dish of all time.  Last night, I ordered the dish again with expectations of the same great tasting dish I've had since I was 13 years old. I was mistaken. At first bite, I noticed the difference. The once, flavorful and creamy pasta was now a diluted shame. What a disappointment. My only regret, is that i didn't call attention to the Server and Manger  with my disapproval. I honestly think I was just in disbelief that I continued to eat the dish hoping to taste the same great flavor I've grown to remember.  One more thing, the cheesecake. They're smaller, significantly smaller. My ""go to"" cheesecake is the Dulce De Leche. I don't even look at the menu after a big heavy meal, it's Dulce De Leche all the way! Although the cheesecake did not go down in quality, it went down in quantity. The dessert is no longer humongous and topped with big chunks of candied caramel, but rather a decent portion with tiny speckles of caramel. Ok, so you may be thinking, it's decent, so why complain? My point being is that I'm getting less than what I've got in the past. However, I am ok with this change, it's quality over quantity. So what's the cause of all these changes in this establishment? Inflation? Change in Management? Business strategy? Maybe all of the above. I get it. Things change and this is a business, It's the nature of the field.

Our waiter was very nice, but we had like five different people help us so I honestly didn't know who to direct my questions and requests to.

I do however need to reiterate that the customer service was very kind and welcoming, however, management might not be up to par considering extremely long wait times for dining amenities. Also, pricing for particular dishes (especially) burgers and alcohol related drinks were marked up to the extreme, as the burger I had was subpar yet costed me a hefty ten dollars-eleven dollars.

While it was our fault that we should've asked our server to get the drink for us he was never around our table. We had to resort to asking another server. So we confronted him about the milkshake and asked for it to be taken off our bill. He rolled his eyes, scrunched up his face and said, ""Next time you should ask your server to take your order and not another that applies to all the restaurants.""

4149,Alexa W.,"Oakland, United States",142,235,332.0,3.0,2015-02-07,"I must admit, I have never been to a Cheesecake Factory in my life. It just never came up. Neither have I been to an Olive Garden. I might have to remedy that soon, so I can be part of the bashing ;-) Anyway, I came here, because a friend works close by and asked to meet me there. I didn't even know Macy's has a seventh floor. Let alone a secret escalator from its seventh floor up to the ""Factory"". So I came with low expectations, knowing this is a chain that has high caloric foods and is very popular among teens and tourists.  We met at 4:30 pm and my friend had already put her name down. We waited another 15 minutes before we were seated. Thankfully, we were seated outside right at the edge of the balcony with view of Union Square. Really nice! The waitress was very friendly, offered bread (which we refused) and came back after she saw we had wrestled down the huuuuge menu. I wasn't really super hungry, so I opted for something small and fried instead of large and healthy (weird logic, I know). So I got little potato balls filled with cheese and bacon and a sour cream dip... an appetizer that was more than a normal person would eat as a whole meal. My friend got a pizza, which was regular sized. Both dishes were surprisingly good. I saw a lot of other fried things, but also salads, fish etc. on other tables, it all looked appetizing.  We skipepd the dessert, but took a look at the cake counter. Man, those pieces were ginormous! I would have loved to take one home, to see what the fuss is all about, but didn't want to drag cake through SF on my shopping tour, so I didn't. The prices are ok, I guess.

694,Christina C.,"San Jose, CA",1,4,4.0,1.0,2015-02-12,"There is a host there with a tattoo on his arm that was being really rude towards my friends and I. First of all, the lady told us that it was going to be a 45 minute wait for a table seating outside on the rooftop. We were okay with that and they were going to text us when our table was ready because we were going to shop around union square while we wait. We came back 50 minutes later to check on our table and they told us it was going to be another 5-10 minute wait. We waited at the waiting room that they had for another hour. When my friend finally received the text that the table was ready, he went to go check in but another host was there. It was a young man with a tattoo on his arm who was giving my friend attitude saying he texted us 5 minutes ago and gave our table away. My friend barely received the text 2 minutes ago and they already decided to give our table away instead of walking around and calling our group. We were literally just a few steps away from them. It's not that hard to walk over and tell us our table is ready and how are you going to give away our table when you barely just texted us. What if we were shopping at a different store and recieved the text? That would have taken probably 10 minutes for us to arrive back at the Cheesecake Factory. In this case, we were already at the restaurant waiting so there was no need to give us attitude and give our table away. I don't understand what kind of service this location was giving, but it was totally unfair. We ended up hungrily waiting for 2hrs. We did not even receive an apology from him for his stupidity. I didn't get a chance to get his name. However, our waiter/server turned our day around. He was the only one who apologized and tried to make our evening better. It just shows how bad it is when the waiter has to apologize for the host. I am really disappointed with the service we received from the host during my visit.

It's your typical run of the mill chain establishment albeit a bit more upscale with a myriad of menu options. This one in San Francisco however, offers that city by the bay nostalgia. The outdoor balcony offers an excellent ambience, especially in the winter when you can overlook Union Square's beautiful and massive Christmas tree and the ice skating mishaps. The heat lamps help keep the cold at bay, but if that doesn't keep you warm there's a variety of alcoholic beverages on the drink menu to warm you up and put some hair on your chest.  The only reason why I've given this one 3 stars is because you can never eat here without at least a 45 minute wait for indoor or outdoor seating. Also, the bar ran out of Asian pear martinis, Mai Tais, and Moscow Mules. Really, 0 for 3!?!  If your in a hurry and it doesn't mean that much to you to sit outside, it's best to wait near the bar and grab a seat once one becomes available.

So the first time we had a slice of Oreo-Cheesecake and one of salted caramel. Sooooo tasty! We took it outside and ate it in the park close-by! Guess what, they even add whip cream into the plastic container - as if the cake was not yet creamy enough! Second time we returned we actually ate there as well and it was awesome as well. As we came up the eighth floor of the Macy's store, it was so crowded. So we received a buzzer and had to wait like 30-40 minutes. So we spent the next time at the bar and had some cocktails. Those were so awesome and tasty. All about 11 bucks and got as all drunk as we hadn't eaten yet. So by the time we went to our table, we were all still being tipsy.  We ordered a garlic-cheese-bread as a starter and they serve warm bread and butter, too! It was all very yummy and the garlic-bread came with a Parmesan pesto and a tomato salsa! Great.  As my main course, I ordered a Ceaser salad with chicken. It was a big-ass salad with nicely grilled chicken breast. As dessert we had again a couple of slices of Cheesecake that we all shared as we were already pretty much stuffed and the cake is very rich. We had a slice of the pumpkin-pecan cheesecake and it was gorgeous, too. Overall, the prices are a bit elevated, but the quality and taste of the food is high!

This time I came on a Thursday night thinking that I could also be seated almost right away since it was the case last time on a Friday night. Nope, it was about 20 minutes wait, which wasn't too bad I suppose. However, service was unbearably slow. Took 15 minutes for us to just get our water and bread. Another long wait before we got our food. They didn't bring out the salad dressing at the same time as my salad (I asked for it on the side) so i had to wait again. They also forgot to put chicken in my salad. They brought it out eventually but after I had a bite, i wish they hadn't. It was literally the dryest, toughest, most unappetizing chicken ever. It tasted like it had been microwaved, frozen, and then reheated in the microwave again.  The salad itself was probably 2.5/5. Absolutely nothing special and there was only one measly piece of asparagus in there. Talk about false advertising. Overall not a good experience at all. Servers were spilling drinks on diners left and right (thankfully not on me). 1 star for the view and another star for not giving me food poisoning or getting dirty stuff in my food.

4247,Lauren L.,"South San Francisco, United States",1,9,3.0,2.0,2015-05-08,"I'm a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory and usually go to the Hillsdale one. I was in San Francisco with my friends today and we decided to try the one here. Problem number one: the wait. It was a Tuesday morning-afternoon so you'd think it wouldn't be so busy, well it was so we had a wait time of 15 minutes. As soon as our buzzer went off, we were told to standby and wait for our waitress to take us to our seat, which lasted about ten minutes. I was confused at this point; why have the buzzer go off only to have us wait even longer? I went up to the desk to ask what we were supposed to be doing, and the girl rudely responded with ""we have a lot of tickets."" I don't know what that means but she could have handled my simple question much more professionally and kindly.  After more minutes of idly standing around, we were finally taken to our seat. Note that there are three people in our party, yet our table only had plates and silverware for two people. I failed to realize this until near the end though, and apparently our waitress never realized it either, even when serving our bread.  My friend had a couple of dollars in quarters that she needed to exchange for some dollars, so when she asked the waitress if she could, the waitress responded quickly with ""you gotta do that at the bakery,"" before she quickly disappeared again. She left my friend confused, we didn't know where the ""bakery"" was since the whole restaurant looked like a bakery.  Next comes ordering. Ordering was fine and our food was good. One of my friends and I got a new batch of water from the waitress, and immediately noticed something was off. Our water was absolutely repulsive. It tasted like tap water mixed with blood, and contained no ice. We asked for a new cup of water, and this time it tasted better, but still had no ice. Next came ordering the cheesecake. I first asked if they were serving the Peppermint Bark one, since our buzzer said ""Peppermint Bark cheesecake is back!"" The waitress responded curtly with ""that's only in the winter."" Feeling a bit disappointed and confused since the peppermint bark flavor was advertised but yet not available, I went with another flavor. Our waitress did not write down what we ordered and memorized it instead. When she brought over our cake, she didn't say a word the whole time and gave each of us our wrong cheesecake. She could have at least asked us who had what instead of slamming them down at our table and have us do the hassle of rearranging of who had what. My friend asked another waitress if she could get a to-go box for the rest of her cake. And the waitress rudely responded with ""it will be one moment,"" never stopping, and kept walking by. Needless to say my friend never got her box, and finally had to ask another waitress for it. We left with mixed feelings. The food was good except for that awful water, but the service was terrible. The waitresses are all rude and stuck up and do not engage with the customers at all. I will be sticking to the one in Hillsdale.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=620,3.08,2.95,2.852,2.6960000000000006,3.0020000000000007

I've been to this one several times, so I know what to expect. Tonight after my original plans were canceled I came here with two of my close friends for some dinner. We arrived around 7:50pm and were told the wait would be about 30-35 minutes. No big deal we had plenty of time and ordered some drinks at the bar and lounged outside by the big sign overlooking Union Square (quite a nice view). We were seated around 8:20pm. One tip I will say is that while there is always a bit of a wait the outside seating usually is quicker (there are heat lamps all around, so it's still very warm and the view is great especially with the fog rolling in). One other tip I will say to do is while waiting look over the menu! The menu has a ton of options and by knowing what you want now you can get your order in ASAP. Anyways, after we were seated it took probably 5-10 more minutes to get the waiter to our table and we ordered. I ordered the chicken and biscuits and a nacho appetizer. It took roughly another 20-30 minutes to get the rest of our food, but I am the type that likes to talk and after a few drinks we didn't even notice the time passing by. Our waiter Javier was very nice and was never pushy or impassive. The nachos were great! They had a sweet taste to them and everything came together nicely and nothing tasted soggy (like some nachos can be). The chicken and biscuits was also very good! I didn't realize they came with mushrooms (which I hate) but they were easy enough to identify and move over. The chicken was nice and juicy and the gravy went well with the meal.

I still feel the bread sticks would of been a better meal then the three course I ordered. the mushrooms were lacking something , but it wasnt the sauce they were in(sauce was BOMB). pot stickers were way to salty to eat more then one and what should of been the best part was far from it. the load of  noodles were very chewy and the sauce was bland. with the amount of noodles in my dish it was like a treasure hunt to find any mushrooms or chicken . i did not get a to go box",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=1240,3.04,2.98,2.84,2.6640000000000006,3.0040000000000004

Nope, it was about 20 minutes wait, which wasn't too bad I suppose. However, service was unbearably slow. Took 15 minutes for us to just get our water and bread. Another long wait before we got our food. They didn't bring out the salad dressing at the same time as my salad (I asked for it on the side) so i had to wait again. They also forgot to put chicken in my salad. They brought it out eventually but after I had a bite, i wish they hadn't. It was literally the dryest, toughest, most unappetizing chicken ever. It tasted like it had been microwaved, frozen, and then reheated in the microwave again.  The salad itself was probably 2.5/5. Absolutely nothing special and there was only one measly piece of asparagus in there. Talk about false advertising. Overall not a good experience at all. Servers were spilling drinks on diners left and right (thankfully not on me). 1 star for the view and another star for not giving me food poisoning or getting dirty stuff in my food.

After a simple elevator ride we where at the host station in the Cheesecake Factory, it seemed like a safe bet... Then the usual casual dining messing about started, oh it's 10 mins for a table (but half the restaurant is empty....)  We where seated at a cold table and introduced to server number 1, who got us bread and water and gave us menus, next the handoff to server number 2, introduced by server 1, the bus boy brings our food, then comes server 2 handing us off to server 3. We eat, and wait, and wait, and wait passing the time by guessing how long it will take each party being sat at the draughty table next to us and the terrace door to ask to be moved, one after the other 4 maybe 5 parties are sat there and then ask to move... it helped pass the time while we stared at our empty dirty plates for 30 mins after we finished eating. We then asked server number 4 for our bill as he was resetting the table next to us. Disgraceful service, 4 servers for one course, cop on guys, as for repeatedly seating people at the other table, that's just sloppy, restaurant was half full, this table did not need to be used. As for the food, it was as to be expected, could have been anywhere in any TGI Fridays, Hard Rock, or similarly freezer to grill establishment.

I've been to other Cheesecake Factory's but none on the 8th floor over looking part of a city as beautiful as San Francisco.

The choices were Steak Diane, Chicken Madiera, Shrimp Scampi and Herb Crusted Salmon. I picked the Steak Diane and Herb Crusted Salmon and its served with mashed potatoes as the side. I requested my steak medium but received a near well done piece of meat. The flavor was sort of bland to me which showcases poor attention to the steak. The Herb Crusted Salmon was a bit dry but the flavor was bursting and popping quite well.       I decided not to order dessert as I'm not a dessert person. But I did have a few Lagunita IPAs which I enjoyed from the draft. I'm used to the bottles and you can taste the difference.       The service was actually excellent by the waiter.

I might have to remedy that soon, so I can be part of the bashing ;-) Anyway, I came here, because a friend works close by and asked to meet me there. I didn't even know Macy's has a seventh floor. Let alone a secret escalator from its seventh floor up to the ""Factory"". So I came with low expectations, knowing this is a chain that has high caloric foods and is very popular among teens and tourists.  We met at 4:30 pm and my friend had already put her name down. We waited another 15 minutes before we were seated. Thankfully, we were seated outside right at the edge of the balcony with view of Union Square. Really nice! The waitress was very friendly, offered bread (which we refused) and came back after she saw we had wrestled down the huuuuge menu. I wasn't really super hungry, so I opted for something small and fried instead of large and healthy (weird logic, I know). So I got little potato balls filled with cheese and bacon and a sour cream dip... an appetizer that was more than a normal person would eat as a whole meal. My friend got a pizza, which was regular sized. Both dishes were surprisingly good. I saw a lot of other fried things, but also salads, fish etc. on other tables, it all looked appetizing.  We skipepd the dessert, but took a look at the cake counter. Man, those pieces were ginormous! I would have loved to take one home, to see what the fuss is all about, but didn't want to drag cake through SF on my shopping tour, so I didn't. The prices are ok, I guess.

We came back once we were called and the person at the front desk told us that they messed up the seating, however, we were next on the list and was offered free appetizers. I thought that it was going great at this point. However what really killed the meal was that the drink I ordered contained small pieces of crushed glass. I didn't realize what it was at first and started to chew on it, but it was sharp and definitely dangerous.

277,Lauren L.,"South San Francisco, CA",1,9,3.0,2.0,2015-08-05,"I'm a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory and usually go to the Hillsdale one. I was in San Francisco with my friends today and we decided to try the one here. Problem number one: the wait. It was a Tuesday morning-afternoon so you'd think it wouldn't be so busy, well it was so we had a wait time of 15 minutes. As soon as our buzzer went off, we were told to standby and wait for our waitress to take us to our seat, which lasted about ten minutes. I was confused at this point; why have the buzzer go off only to have us wait even longer? I went up to the desk to ask what we were supposed to be doing, and the girl rudely responded with ""we have a lot of tickets."" I don't know what that means but she could have handled my simple question much more professionally and kindly.  After more minutes of idly standing around, we were finally taken to our seat. Note that there are three people in our party, yet our table only had plates and silverware for two people. I failed to realize this until near the end though, and apparently our waitress never realized it either, even when serving our bread.  My friend had a couple of dollars in quarters that she needed to exchange for some dollars, so when she asked the waitress if she could, the waitress responded quickly with ""you gotta do that at the bakery,"" before she quickly disappeared again. She left my friend confused, we didn't know where the ""bakery"" was since the whole restaurant looked like a bakery.  Next comes ordering. Ordering was fine and our food was good. One of my friends and I got a new batch of water from the waitress, and immediately noticed something was off. Our water was absolutely repulsive. It tasted like tap water mixed with blood, and contained no ice. We asked for a new cup of water, and this time it tasted better, but still had no ice. Next came ordering the cheesecake. I first asked if they were serving the Peppermint Bark one, since our buzzer said ""Peppermint Bark cheesecake is back!"" The waitress responded curtly with ""that's only in the winter."" Feeling a bit disappointed and confused since the peppermint bark flavor was advertised but yet not available, I went with another flavor. Our waitress did not write down what we ordered and memorized it instead. When she brought over our cake, she didn't say a word the whole time and gave each of us our wrong cheesecake. She could have at least asked us who had what instead of slamming them down at our table and have us do the hassle of rearranging of who had what. My friend asked another waitress if she could get a to-go box for the rest of her cake. And the waitress rudely responded with ""it will be one moment,"" never stopping, and kept walking by. Needless to say my friend never got her box, and finally had to ask another waitress for it. We left with mixed feelings. The food was good except for that awful water, but the service was terrible. The waitresses are all rude and stuck up and do not engage with the customers at all. I will be sticking to the one in Hillsdale.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=620,3.04,2.95,2.98,2.3120000000000003,2.9860000000000007

After a simple elevator ride we where at the host station in the Cheesecake Factory, it seemed like a safe bet... Then the usual casual dining messing about started, oh it's 10 mins for a table (but half the restaurant is empty....)  We where seated at a cold table and introduced to server number 1, who got us bread and water and gave us menus, next the handoff to server number 2, introduced by server 1, the bus boy brings our food, then comes server 2 handing us off to server 3. We eat, and wait, and wait, and wait passing the time by guessing how long it will take each party being sat at the draughty table next to us and the terrace door to ask to be moved, one after the other 4 maybe 5 parties are sat there and then ask to move... it helped pass the time while we stared at our empty dirty plates for 30 mins after we finished eating. We then asked server number 4 for our bill as he was resetting the table next to us. Disgraceful service, 4 servers for one course, cop on guys, as for repeatedly seating people at the other table, that's just sloppy, restaurant was half full, this table did not need to be used. As for the food, it was as to be expected, could have been anywhere in any TGI Fridays, Hard Rock, or similarly freezer to grill establishment.

Since I just could not decide on anything cause it felt like hard work going through all of the options listed, I just picked the ""sunday brunch combo"", which consisted in scrambled eggs, bacon and pancakes. I asked if they could add some strawberries to the mix and the very nice waiter gladly agreed. I also had some fresh squeezed orange juice. I was pretty unimpressed with my plate. The scrambled eggs were not really scrambled, and if it were not for the strawberries, this would be a pretty poor-looking meal for quite a high price. The juice was nice, the pancakes were nice, but when the bill came and I realized I had just spent almost 40 USD on a pretty sleazy breakfast I felt kind of dumb. I'd probably come back if I had to, since the menu is so large and the staff is so nice, but I feel like this is more of a tourist trap than anything else.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=300,2.64,2.88,2.94,2.412,2.7840000000000003

Once you're seated, you're often greeted by some of the best waiting staff I have interacted with in the city. The food is surprisingly good with many options at decent prices considering the location - although the cheesecakes are about 30% more expensive than other locations at about $10 per slice (which you forget about one bite in - I recommend the Tuxedo). However, I reeeeeeally don't think it's worth the trip if you ask me. As you come in, a typical wait is 45-90 minutes. The hosting staff is nowhere near as pleasant as the waiters, and the approximate waiting times you get are often off. There are no reservations, and very clear inefficiencies. For example, if you decide to take a cheesecake to-go and not wait to be seated, the person taking your order at the very under-utilized takeout counter would not be responsible for putting it in a box for you to get going, although they are literally standing in front of the cake fridge, and yes, you end up with a 20 minute wait as your cake enters the restaurant queue while the two cashiers sit there and gossip.

We arrived at the restaurant with hopes that we could be seated on the balcony and be able to see the activities and decorations below. Unfortunately, it was a chilly night and we opted for indoor seating.  We ordered the spicy chicken chipotle pasta (my go to) and bang bang chicken and shrimp. The chipotle gave the pasta dish a nice tasty kick and the chicken was well portioned in the dish. The meal was so delicious and filling that I, unfortunately, had no room for cheesecake.  The restaurant is in a prime location and is, to no one's surprised, overwhelmed with guests. While other parties were frequently checked upon, our server was nowhere to be seen from the time our order was taken and the time our meal was over. When she dropped the check off at our table, the highest suggested tip was circled. I found this action rude based on her absence.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=320,2.52,2.84,2.932,3.248,2.712

Now the hard decision to make www which mojito to get, I usually go with the Pineapple since it screams the essence of equator living. I ordered one for myself and told my lunch mates that they should follow suit. The bartender offered his suggestion of Blueberry Mojitos for them since they had never tried them and it was now time to sit back and watch him do his thing.

The cheese cake factory always give huge portions which is a plus.  -The pasta was good but not great, i like some of the other ones more actually.

It tastes a lot better though when they come and shred lots of yummy cheese on it! -My friend ordered the louisiana chicken pasta. I liked that one more than mine. Its realllllyy creamy and nice a nice kick to it too. Lots of flavor and the chicken is really good too.

So the first time we had a slice of Oreo-Cheesecake and one of salted caramel. Sooooo tasty! We took it outside and ate it in the park close-by! Guess what, they even add whip cream into the plastic container - as if the cake was not yet creamy enough! Second time we returned we actually ate there as well and it was awesome as well. As we came up the eighth floor of the Macy's store, it was so crowded. So we received a buzzer and had to wait like 30-40 minutes. So we spent the next time at the bar and had some cocktails. Those were so awesome and tasty. All about 11 bucks and got as all drunk as we hadn't eaten yet. So by the time we went to our table, we were all still being tipsy.  We ordered a garlic-cheese-bread as a starter and they serve warm bread and butter, too! It was all very yummy and the garlic-bread came with a Parmesan pesto and a tomato salsa! Great.  As my main course, I ordered a Ceaser salad with chicken. It was a big-ass salad with nicely grilled chicken breast. As dessert we had again a couple of slices of Cheesecake that we all shared as we were already pretty much stuffed and the cake is very rich.

I've been to other Cheesecake Factory's but none on the 8th floor over looking part of a city as beautiful as San Francisco. The elegance at this particular location does set it apart from others and to me it was the balcony dining that created that separation.       I ordered what they call the Factory Combo which you had a choice of two items. The choices were Steak Diane, Chicken Madiera, Shrimp Scampi and Herb Crusted Salmon. I picked the Steak Diane and Herb Crusted Salmon and its served with mashed potatoes as the side. I requested my steak medium but received a near well done piece of meat. The flavor was sort of bland to me which showcases poor attention to the steak. The Herb Crusted Salmon was a bit dry but the flavor was bursting and popping quite well.       I decided not to order dessert as I'm not a dessert person. But I did have a few Lagunita IPAs which I enjoyed from the draft. I'm used to the bottles and you can taste the difference.       The service was actually excellent by the waiter. He was very attentive but not annoying and seemed to pick the times to question refills.       The reason for the 3 stars is a direct reflection of their food which is why I came here.

I am a server myself so I have understanding and patience but this place was ridiculous.  The wait for our table was long, About 50 minutes. When we got seated our party of 7 was squished into a table with enough room for 4 or 5 people maximum.  We waited about 15 minutes after ordering our drinks for them to arrive at our table. One of the drinks never showed up at all.  The food was nice but it wasn't hot. My enchiladas were luke warm at best. I didn't return them to be heated as i knew my party would be finished their dishes before mine came back. We waited 45 minutes from when our cheque arrived at the table to when it was collected. We couldn't wait to get out of the place. I then checked my bank statement a few days later and my account had been charged accordingly and then the amount was returned to my account. The following day my account was charged the incorrect amount. (10 dollars too much) I have been on the phone twice to the cheese cake factory, on hold for 15/20 minutes both times. No apology or reason for this error has been given and I still have not been refunded. One manager was Linda, The other didn't give a name.

Enjoyed every single visit - at least for the food. Visited at mid day with two overseas guests, wait was approx 20mins, the shortest of the three visits that I had.  We were seated promptly but the server took years to come by. Was the least friendly and inattentive server I have met at Cheesecake Factory. Ordered onion rings, Vietnamese rolls, red velvet cheesecake and 2 other cheesecakes which I can't recall right now. The food as usual were yummy. The Vietnamese rolls are not the authentic Vietnamese roll but they tasted fine. The onion rings were super good.  The cheesecakes were of course the main highlight. My guests were overwhelmed with the options available and were so torn having to choose three out of the entire list.  All the cheesecake tasted fantastic. Key Lime Cheesecake is my ultimate favorite among the list. Definitely worth visiting and worth the wait. Try to visit during mid day might help to shave off some wait time.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=240,3.08,3.04,2.972,3.3440000000000003,3.0560000000000005

I ordered 2 louisiana chicken pastas with no vegetables. The order was made with no vegetables AND no spices. He huffed and puffed while making me feel how inconvenient it was for him to tell the kitchen to add spices. He also made it a point to mention that ""it was a fill in cashier"" Whenever that means. When my order was ready, he said ""okay you're all set"" ...actually I also ordered a strawberry lemonade. He went to the bar to get it, came back, handed me the lemonade and walked away before I could ask him what his name was. Benaster was rude to the point that i felt offended. I asked another gentleman standing nearby what his name was, he replied ""Band.""  This interaction was still bothering me when I got home, so I called to speak to a manager.

It's not that hard to walk over and tell us our table is ready and how are you going to give away our table when you barely just texted us. What if we were shopping at a different store and recieved the text? That would have taken probably 10 minutes for us to arrive back at the Cheesecake Factory. In this case, we were already at the restaurant waiting so there was no need to give us attitude and give our table away. I don't understand what kind of service this location was giving, but it was totally unfair. We ended up hungrily waiting for 2hrs. We did not even receive an apology from him for his stupidity. I didn't get a chance to get his name. However, our waiter/server turned our day around. He was the only one who apologized and tried to make our evening better. It just shows how bad it is when the waiter has to apologize for the host. I am really disappointed with the service we received from the host during my visit.

So my review for this is strictly based on this location. Pros: - Available seating indoors or outdoors (outdoor seating is the best on a sunny day since you'll have a great view of Union Square. It's also gorgeous during the winter, but make sure to wear a warm jacket or sweater since it tends to be pretty cold in SF) - Located on the top floor of Macy's, so you know where to go if you want to walk off that cheesecake after. You're also near a lot of shops along Union Square, which is also pretty neat-o.  - Their cheesecakes, while the same in most locations, are always definitely a pro here. You can have them to-go or dine in and eat em there.  Cons: - Service is definitely a hit or miss, but it all depends on how busy it gets. - Since a lot of tourists and visitors like to come here after a day of exploring Union Square, be prepared to wait for a while.  - The food is standard, but definitely overpriced. - Parking around Union Square is difficult not only because of the price, but because of how packed it gets, as well as the traffic that comes along with being a touristy area.

It's been a long day for me and my friends from work. We wanted to eat. But we're too tired and annoyed to wait. The manager though was good at handling the mess. But yes, you need to train your servers well!

3047,Chardonnai S.,"San Lorenzo, CA",96,88,94.0,1.0,2016-02-08,"I guess I should have known that it was going to be a bad experience when I tried to place an order over the phone and was put on hold such a long time that I made it all the way to the entrance of the restaurant and was still on hold. I finally hung up.. All I wanted to do was order a green salad with no carrots to go. I thought maybe the restaurant would be busy because it's the day after the Super Bowl and they may have visitors. It was not busy at all. I place my order, paid and stood away from the counter waiting for my order. I continue to wait as other guests were given their to go orders. I did notice there were four gentlemen that were very irritated because they had to wait a long time just to get four pieces of cheesecake. Finally I asked the girl that took my order, was it ready. I think she had forgotten because she was busy trying to finish her water, close the register, and finish talking to the person that was starting her shift. Please keep in my I was on my lunch break and time was of th essence.  The cashier/order taker didn't take an attitude when I asked for my food but took a long to go and put it in a bag with bread. When I got the bag I quickly looked in it only to find three spoons. I asked for a fork and was told they were out. Really, a spoon for a salad? I got a fork from somewhere else.  Anyway I hurried to go and eat especially since it already had taken about 15 to 20 minutes to get my meal.  I sat down and took the salad out of the bag and was saddened by the poor salad with some wilted and even brown lettuce mixed together. Now I received 4 loaves of bread in a container maybe to make up for the bad looking salad. I gave most of the bread to a coworker.  I'm not what the problem was but I think it will be another very long time before I'll visit this location especially on my lunch break.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=240,3.72,2.97,3.012,1.8280000000000003,3.2700000000000005

The service is mediocre. Takes a little while to catch their attention.  They start off giving you some free bread at the table. I like the rye bread.  We ordered the Thai Glazed Salmon over coconut rice (the dinner portion) $19.95. They had a lunch portion for $14.95 but my mom and I aren't heavy eaters so we shared. We still could not finish the whole portion! The meal was pretty good though.  I'd only stop by here if I'm in the area I would stop by.

The location is at the top of Macy's in Union Square so pretty damn good location.  They offer outside seating with views of the square.  Considering the overpriced tourist trap restaurants in and around the square, this location is generally in line with the average prices you would see across their different locations.  For being in Union Square, one might even say this place is a ""deal"" all things considered.    However, also being in a prime location means people everywhere.  It is a complete madhouse in there and beyond loud.  I'm already not a fan of the Cheesecake Factory's standby-only policy due to their refusal to accept reservations which is why I rarely dine here.  The front desk and whole waiting area is a disaster.  People standing shoulder-to-shoulder, some people sprawled out on the floor probably due to hunger, dehydration and exhaustion from waiting out this archaic process.  People are pushing on each other, throwing elbows and just lots of general overall rudeness you would expect to get from starving people in a loud, crowded, dimly lit, stuffy room probably resentful knowing that a reservation could have avoided some of this. If you go down the escalator one level there are couches and chairs in Macy's home furnishings department but even those fill up with weary Cheesecake Factory refugees.

The location is at the top of Macy's in Union Square so pretty damn good location.  They offer outside seating with views of the square.  Considering the overpriced tourist trap restaurants in and around the square, this location is generally in line with the average prices you would see across their different locations.  For being in Union Square, one might even say this place is a ""deal"" all things considered.    However, also being in a prime location means people everywhere.  It is a complete madhouse in there and beyond loud.  I'm already not a fan of the Cheesecake Factory's standby-only policy due to their refusal to accept reservations which is why I rarely dine here.  The front desk and whole waiting area is a disaster.  People standing shoulder-to-shoulder, some people sprawled out on the floor probably due to hunger, dehydration and exhaustion from waiting out this archaic process.  People are pushing on each other, throwing elbows and just lots of general overall rudeness you would expect to get from starving people in a loud, crowded, dimly lit, stuffy room probably resentful knowing that a reservation could have avoided some of this. If you go down the escalator one level there are couches and chairs in Macy's home furnishings department but even those fill up with weary Cheesecake Factory refugees.

What's more fun it's situated on 8th floor of an insane sized Macy's. The clientele was mostly tourists like myself and very pushy and rude but the servers kept a smile on their face the entire time. I ordered grilled salmon the way they used to make BBQ salmon over succotash with a side of sweet potato fries. Had a apple strudel cheesecake with a side of ice cream. The food was excellent in presentation and taste / texture. The view from the patio was pretty amazing. During that time there was a Christmas tree and a roller skating rink with many people having a good time. I want to thank the waitress Gabriella for such a great experience and for keeping a smile when the table with the trash family started belittling her for some butter...

Our bill comes out and 2 of us 4 decide to go use the restroom as we are walking there we are being followed as if they thought we were going to ditch the bill we return to the table another manager is standing a few steps away and is just lingering around we put the bill on the table and start to walk out and the manager that was standing around runs over and grabs the bill off of the table and immediately opens it after he realizes we paid the entire thing he has a stupid look on his face.

Fact: the union square cheesecake is the second highest grossing cheesecake in the nation, so it will be packed no matter what time you go. Be prepared or grab a spot at the bar where there's pretty good turnover.  I'm not going to give a recount of everything I've eaten there but know they have a new kale quinoa salad (the bigger one of the two) that is delicious. It's a great pairing with the buffalo chicken bites.  Wash that down with a cocktail of your choice in a classic Cheesecake Factory glass and you're in business.

I went up to the hostess and I told her we were buzzed and she said we werent buzzed yet and if it did buzz it was a test. A test? I became upset and brought it to her attention that people who were there after us got seated first. She said she couldnt do anything about that and told us to wait again. Well we waited another 10 mins and finally were seated.  That wasnt the worst part.  Our waitress came and we ordered our drinks and food (since we waited about 2 hours to be seated).

We waited and waited and waited for about another 20 mins, everyone who was standing with us were seated, including people who got there after us. I went up to the hostess and I told her we were buzzed and she said we werent buzzed yet and if it did buzz it was a test. A test? I became upset and brought it to her attention that people who were there after us got seated first. She said she couldnt do anything about that and told us to wait again. Well we waited another 10 mins and finally were seated.  That wasnt the worst part.  Our waitress came and we ordered our drinks and food (since we waited about 2 hours to be seated). Well we waited about ANOTHER hour for our food, and again we saw other guests who were seated AFTER us getting their food. I requested to speak to the manager and I informed him we had been waiting about an hour for our food and pointed out everyone was getting served before us, he asked what we ordered and then replied with ""protein usually takes longer than pastas"" he went to go check on it and 5 mins later our waitress come out with our food apologizing for it taking so long. The manager came to us 2 mins after and also apologized and said he didnt know why it was sitting there for so long. He was nice enough to pay for our dinner. But never again will we return after an experience like this. Arrived at about 8:30pm and left around 11:30pm.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=440,2.8,2.93,2.848,1.988,2.878

This time I came here for brunch. I ordered the French Toast. It doesn't look like the traditional french toast. It is very fancy and it is very good! I would order it again next time.  The cheesecakes they serve are very good too. It is kind of expensive, but it is definitely worth it.

I know, I know, it's the Cheesecake Factory, nothing really to get all excited about. But my experience this time was actually very decent. The ambiance of the place is pretty neat. You have a nice marble floor, the craziest view of Union Square above Macy's, and if you don't want to eat outside (which we elected not to in order to avoid pesky pigeon poop) you can be seated at these cute little wooden booths.  Our waiter was very nice and caring. A kid at our party is allergic to eggs, thus we asked the waiter to separate the buns and the patties of the sliders that we ordered. He readily complied. What a chum. We ordered a Lunch Special Famous Factory Meat Loaf, Lunch Special Shepard's pie, Fried Calamari, Sweet Potato Fries, sliders, fried chicken. I personally had the lunch meat loaf as I had the Shepard's pie before. The waiter asked if we wanted bread, and I highly suggest that you don't miss out on it. They give you three bread sticks--two rye and one French bread with lots of butter packs. I'm a sucker for bread, and this bread wasn't bad. CALAMARI (~$16.50): Decent, they give you a decent amount for ~$16.50 along with two dips--cocktail sauce and garlic sauce. Good effort. SWEET POTATO FRIES (~$12.50): I'm not a fan of sweet potato fries, but these were solid. LUNCH SPECIAL FAMOUS FACTORY MEAT LOAF (~$13.50): My main dish. They give you two SIZABLE slices topped with onions and sided with succotash and mashed potatoes with gravy on the side. The meatloaf was decent, but had a tad too much rosemary flavor it to. After consuming the calamari, sweet potato fries, and the bread, this was too much for me to finish and I took half of it home.  LUNCH SPECIAL SHEPARD'S PIE (~$13.50): My favorite of all the dishes I sampled--the ground beef topped with mash potatoes was a wonder to behold. I could eat something like that all day. Sure, it's a simple meal, but the amount was HUGE and it was very tasty.  FRIED CHICKEN (~$13.50): The fried chicken was OK, it wasn't all flour like the frozen Tyson chicken you get at the frozen section of the local supermarket, and the meat was surprisingly moist. :) TASTE: 4 stars--portions are good, food is surprisingly decent. SERVICE: 3 stars--they didn't refill our water. That's a boo boo. But the waiter took care of my demands. AMBIANCE: 5 stars--nice view and beautiful interior.

What a chum. We ordered a Lunch Special Famous Factory Meat Loaf, Lunch Special Shepard's pie, Fried Calamari, Sweet Potato Fries, sliders, fried chicken. I personally had the lunch meat loaf as I had the Shepard's pie before. The waiter asked if we wanted bread, and I highly suggest that you don't miss out on it. They give you three bread sticks--two rye and one French bread with lots of butter packs. I'm a sucker for bread, and this bread wasn't bad. CALAMARI (~$16.50): Decent, they give you a decent amount for ~$16.50 along with two dips--cocktail sauce and garlic sauce. Good effort. SWEET POTATO FRIES (~$12.50): I'm not a fan of sweet potato fries, but these were solid. LUNCH SPECIAL FAMOUS FACTORY MEAT LOAF (~$13.50): My main dish. They give you two SIZABLE slices topped with onions and sided with succotash and mashed potatoes with gravy on the side. The meatloaf was decent, but had a tad too much rosemary flavor it to. After consuming the calamari, sweet potato fries, and the bread, this was too much for me to finish and I took half of it home.  LUNCH SPECIAL SHEPARD'S PIE (~$13.50): My favorite of all the dishes I sampled--the ground beef topped with mash potatoes was a wonder to behold. I could eat something like that all day. Sure, it's a simple meal, but the amount was HUGE and it was very tasty.  FRIED CHICKEN (~$13.50): The fried chicken was OK, it wasn't all flour like the frozen Tyson chicken you get at the frozen section of the local supermarket, and the meat was surprisingly moist. :) TASTE: 4 stars--portions are good, food is surprisingly decent. SERVICE: 3 stars--they didn't refill our water. That's a boo boo. But the waiter took care of my demands. AMBIANCE: 5 stars--nice view and beautiful interior. PRICE: 4 stars--it's a solid price for a lot of food. TOTAL: 4 stars--I'd come here again. Bottom Line: THE FOOD IS SOLID. The ambiance is nice. I wanna bring my date here next time. Heck, I might just bring myself.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=200,2.08,2.8,2.836,2.288,2.512

Out of all the places to savor my little sister chose the Cheesecake Factory.  I would recommend parking in a garage (prices range from different businesses) and walking to this location or taking the bart. Parking on the streets in the city can be hard to find. Go exploring after to get your money's worth!  This restaurant is located inside Macy's right where Union Square is. On a Saturday around 1 pm we waited 30 minutes for our outdoor table. Keep in mind you are in San Francisco and in the middle of an endless shopping area. It wasn't a surprise there was a wait. One of the wonderful things that I love about going to the city is listening to the background of tourists who are ecstatic to be here in San Francisco :). It makes waiting more entertaining!  I appreciated the fact that our waiters were still attentive and would ask us if we needed anything else throughout our lunch despite it being busy. Great customer service! Also the dining place itself was very clean and tables were immediately bused when customers left. At chains like the Cheesecake Factory, I tend to order what I know is good and stick with it.  What I recommend: Americana Cheeseburger ($13.95) - This burger consists of American/cheddar cheese, crunchy potato crisps, lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, pickles, and secret sauce. A moist burger with ingredients that may seem basic, but coexist to leave you deliciously satisfied until the last mouthful. I find that this entree can be lovingly shared between two people.  Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake- Ever find yourself thinking that your eating cake when your at the Cheesecake Factory? This one is a CLOUD in your mouth compared to some of the flavors that are offered on the menu. The caramel cheesecake isn't taxingly sweet. The caramel mousse and vanilla crust only enhances this simple recipe without overwhelming you and your stomach! Overall this place makes me a pleased customer!

We figured 3.5 hours would be enough time to eat and get to the next location nearby but clearly we were mistaken. After an hour and fifteen minute wait to get seated and a rude hostess who was annoyed by us asking how much longer (our wait time was estimated 30 minutes), we were sat in a section of a dazed and confused server, Issac. He told us while zoning out taking our order that he was tired from working a double the previous day and coming in early Sunday so don't mind him, though I felt bad for him we were behind schedule and his coworker had already left a bad impression. By the time we sat down it was 2:01pm and brunch was over. We placed our orders right away but it took about 45 minutes to get our food. Once we started eating I noticed hair in my food. We spoke to the manager, we told her about the experience with the hostess, our dazed and confused server, the hair, and our lack of time at this point and she started to make excuses. She took my plate then brought back our bill. Never once did she ask me if I wanted my food to be remade nor offer me anything to go since at this point that is what we had to do. When I asked her if that is her common practice and her response was ""maybe I would have if you guys weren't in a rush.""

I finally hung up.. All I wanted to do was order a green salad with no carrots to go. I thought maybe the restaurant would be busy because it's the day after the Super Bowl and they may have visitors. It was not busy at all. I place my order, paid and stood away from the counter waiting for my order. I continue to wait as other guests were given their to go orders. I did notice there were four gentlemen that were very irritated because they had to wait a long time just to get four pieces of cheesecake. Finally I asked the girl that took my order, was it ready. I think she had forgotten because she was busy trying to finish her water, close the register, and finish talking to the person that was starting her shift. Please keep in my I was on my lunch break and time was of th essence.  The cashier/order taker didn't take an attitude when I asked for my food but took a long to go and put it in a bag with bread. When I got the bag I quickly looked in it only to find three spoons. I asked for a fork and was told they were out. Really, a spoon for a salad? I got a fork from somewhere else.  Anyway I hurried to go and eat especially since it already had taken about 15 to 20 minutes to get my meal.  I sat down and took the salad out of the bag and was saddened by the poor salad with some wilted and even brown lettuce mixed together. Now I received 4 loaves of bread in a container maybe to make up for the bad looking salad. I gave most of the bread to a coworker.

However, when we went to the front desk, they had us wait to the left of the desk for our name to be called. Mind you, there were about 5 parties in front of us, still waiting to be seated. AFTER our pager had buzzed. Weird system if you ask me. Our table was nice, but the server.  The server seemed very confused and like she did not have a clear knowledge of the menu. She nearly put in an order for the wrong dish, and when my girlfriend asked for recommendations, she couldn't come up with anything. Weird, again. We waited for about 25 minutes for the last and certainly least....  THE FOOD. I ordered the ""Very Spicy"" Cajun jambalaya pasta. THE blandest pasta I've ever had in my entire life. Like, not even a dash of seasoned salt let alone any spice. And, they gave me shrimp only when the dish clearly is labeled as a dish with chicken AND shrimp. I didn't eat any, and ended up bringing it home to recook and season myself. Overall horrible experience in what was supposed to be a fun anniversary trip to the city.

Out of all the places to savor my little sister chose the Cheesecake Factory.  I would recommend parking in a garage (prices range from different businesses) and walking to this location or taking the bart. Parking on the streets in the city can be hard to find. Go exploring after to get your money's worth!  This restaurant is located inside Macy's right where Union Square is. On a Saturday around 1 pm we waited 30 minutes for our outdoor table. Keep in mind you are in San Francisco and in the middle of an endless shopping area. It wasn't a surprise there was a wait. One of the wonderful things that I love about going to the city is listening to the background of tourists who are ecstatic to be here in San Francisco :). It makes waiting more entertaining!  I appreciated the fact that our waiters were still attentive and would ask us if we needed anything else throughout our lunch despite it being busy. Great customer service! Also the dining place itself was very clean and tables were immediately bused when customers left. At chains like the Cheesecake Factory, I tend to order what I know is good and stick with it.  What I recommend: Americana Cheeseburger ($13.95) - This burger consists of American/cheddar cheese, crunchy potato crisps, lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, pickles, and secret sauce. A moist burger with ingredients that may seem basic, but coexist to leave you deliciously satisfied until the last mouthful. I find that this entree can be lovingly shared between two people.  Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake- Ever find yourself thinking that your eating cake when your at the Cheesecake Factory? This one is a CLOUD in your mouth compared to some of the flavors that are offered on the menu. The caramel cheesecake isn't taxingly sweet. The caramel mousse and vanilla crust only enhances this simple recipe without overwhelming you and your stomach! Overall this place makes me a pleased customer!

However,  what makes this one in particular unique is the incredible view of Union Square and the other FiDi buildings you get from their outdoor patio!  Dining from this height will make the experience feel much more grand and special, if you're willing to deal with the wait and the outdoor elements of wind, sun, and random pigeons. Indoor seating is just as exceptional though, and while the wait time will vary in length, the speed and quality of service I've always received here is superb.  I ultimately give this one 3 stars however because of the lack of waiting space and seating in their foyer (their front desk and cheesecake glass case is hard to access with all the people waiting around), and the small elevator used to get all the way up here. The elevator is always crowded and operates slowly every time we come here, forcing us to tediously ride the escalators all the way up.

4320,Christopher K.,"Alameda, United States",5,53,,2.0,2016-08-24,"I am baffled by this place. Our 13-year-old daughter was keen on going here at the end of a family day out. I'd only heard its name as one more chain and had never thought of going there, but we agreed to try it out. My first impression: crowded, noisy and lame pop music. Waited for a table; the place is unpleasant to be in--really uncomfortably crowded--but we found a good spot on the outside balcony to wait. Nice view (the only real thing this place has going for it). We were lucky enough to be seated outside which was good (except probably for my wife--she was sitting next to a glass wall, with another table on the other side and placed in such a way that she was practically staring another patron in the face from inches away. They should move one of those tables.) It was cool, foggy and breezy outside, but the heat lamps did nicely. When I saw how surprisingly high the prices were, I hoped that it was better than my first impressions had suggested.... I had gumbo, a caesar salad with chicken for the daughter, salmon for my wife and pizza for our son. My wife got a substitution for the potatoes on the salmon plate, but it arrived with potatoes, but missing broccoli. Waiter replaced it. Caesar salad with chicken arrived with no chicken. Waiter fixed it. Wife said salmon was very good. Daughter said some of the chicken was OK, some was way too chewy. My gumbo was OK, but nothing special at all. Probably a little better than a Chili's or similar chain, but completely forgettable, and at a price twice what it was worth. We had some cheesecake, cheesecake and strawberry shortcake. They were all OK. Not memorable at all however.  Dessert made me thirsty, but waiter forgot to fill my water until asked a second time. At the end, we paid at least 50% higher than the food was worth (even for SF), and for marginal service. The really baffling thing is this: The place was packed, with a never-ending stream of people lining up to come in. It was really crowded (and this is late-ish on a Wednesday evening, not a weekend). And many of them looked really psyched to be there. Why? My wife said that most were tourists. But what are they doing here? What made them fly across the country to this city, and walk into a Macys and go up seven floors in an over-crowded elevator for this? Everyone has similar chains back home, right?

The worse, however, was the unacceptable wait for my food. I ordered the pit beef dip while the rest of my family ordered appetizers. However, my food was not brought out with the rest of my family's food.  After 10 minutes,  the manager came by to say that my food was forgotten and the kitchen was making it now.  5 more minutes passed and my waiter came by to say they were making it and it would right out. Another 10 minutes went by,  my family had finished their meals, and the waiter said it would be another 3 minutes. Another 10 minutes passed before the food was brought out.

We had to wait around 20 minutes to get a table.  The menu was really appealing and I was torn between a few options. The crispy chicken costolleta was really good and well cooked. It came with 5 green asparagus and a bunch of french fries (I asked for a substitution as it comes with mashed potatoes on the menu and it came with no charge). The chicken was crispy as expected and the lemon sauce was really good. Asparagus were pretty good too and still crunchy as I like them. Fries were okay, a bit cold. The service was nice, our waiter was really nice and helpful. My husband went for the veggie burger and was quite happy with it too.  We then ordered a slice of strawberry cheesecake to share, we ate it too fast to even snap a picture :-)  While waiting we enjoyed the view on Union Square (and its holiday ice rink opening tomorrow). I'll have to come back to try the Evelyn's favorite pasta :p And maybe another kind of cheesecake (I'll have to decide between chocolate hazelnut, mango key lime ou dutch apple caramel...

Takes a little while to catch their attention.  They start off giving you some free bread at the table. I like the rye bread.  We ordered the Thai Glazed Salmon over coconut rice (the dinner portion) $19.95. They had a lunch portion for $14.95 but my mom and I aren't heavy eaters so we shared. We still could not finish the whole portion! The meal was pretty good though.  I'd only stop by here if I'm in the area I would stop by.

We figured 3.5 hours would be enough time to eat and get to the next location nearby but clearly we were mistaken. After an hour and fifteen minute wait to get seated and a rude hostess who was annoyed by us asking how much longer (our wait time was estimated 30 minutes), we were sat in a section of a dazed and confused server, Issac. He told us while zoning out taking our order that he was tired from working a double the previous day and coming in early Sunday so don't mind him, though I felt bad for him we were behind schedule and his coworker had already left a bad impression. By the time we sat down it was 2:01pm and brunch was over. We placed our orders right away but it took about 45 minutes to get our food. Once we started eating I noticed hair in my food. We spoke to the manager, we told her about the experience with the hostess, our dazed and confused server, the hair, and our lack of time at this point and she started to make excuses. She took my plate then brought back our bill. Never once did she ask me if I wanted my food to be remade nor offer me anything to go since at this point that is what we had to do. When I asked her if that is her common practice and her response was ""maybe I would have if you guys weren't in a rush.""

Load up on some carbs prior to your entree, and you will have no room for cheesecake. Eat with caution.  Since their menu is ridiculously long and extensive, here are some common entree's I like to order in rotation: - Miso Salmon: a fat, juicy, teriyaki based filet of salmon resting on a bed of brown rice, surrounded by snow peas and miso sauce.  - Louisiana Chicken Pasta: a huge portion of bow tie pasta with a cajun kick of flavor, with crispy chicken tenders on top - Avocado Egg rolls: this appetizer can fill me up. Each egg roll is filled with a bite of soft avocado and can be dipped in a tangy tamarind sauce.  Mind you, all these portions are HUGE. They really emphasize on family style portions.

They sent the manager Mariah who only walked over with an air of arrogance and attitude,  offered no apology or explanation. Her attitude ""too bad that's how we do it"". She has poor customer service relation skills and needs An attitude adjustment. She Should not be in a management position if this is how she handles a simple situation.  I appreciated the kitchen manager who was in charge of the whole restaurant. He was gracious and humble. He explained that they measured the portion. If this is the case then people should know that the $15 crab dish they ordered is really just potatoes. It really came down to how a person in management addresses customers.

However,  what makes this one in particular unique is the incredible view of Union Square and the other FiDi buildings you get from their outdoor patio!  Dining from this height will make the experience feel much more grand and special, if you're willing to deal with the wait and the outdoor elements of wind, sun, and random pigeons. Indoor seating is just as exceptional though, and while the wait time will vary in length, the speed and quality of service I've always received here is superb.  I ultimately give this one 3 stars however because of the lack of waiting space and seating in their foyer (their front desk and cheesecake glass case is hard to access with all the people waiting around), and the small elevator used to get all the way up here. The elevator is always crowded and operates slowly every time we come here, forcing us to tediously ride the escalators all the way up. Overall I think my main problem here is accessiblity and openness of the location. Nonetheless, the food is always delicious, and whether or not you're staying to dine here, definitely stop by just to see the view too!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=240,2.52,2.74,2.6,1.836,2.652

Which I have taken into consideration in writing this review. I understand how hectic things can get at a busy restaurant and of course the extremely long wait (over 3 hours) was not very pleasurable; however, it was completely understandable as to why we had to wait that long. Cheesecake is always busy, so they have a system where you check in first, they give you an initial quote of how long you'll have to wait, and a time to return to get your pager.  We were told at 4:40 that we should return at about 6:30 for the pager. The initial quote being 2 hours. We came to get our pager at around 6:30, maybe just a few minutes later. We waited in line for about 20-30 minutes just to receive the pager and then when we got to the front of the line they told us, as well as everyone else that they did not have any more pagers to give out and to come back in 10 minutes to get the pagers. Ultimately, in my opinion it would have been much more efficient just to address the whole lobby rather than have people wasting their time filing through a line only to wait in that same line again just to hope they had enough pagers for all of us. After that, we did receive our pager and were told our wait would be 30 minutes. After over 30 minutes I went to the front just to ask how much longer they thought it would be to be told by a hostess about 10-15 minutes. Keep in mind we were already 45 minutes over our quote at this point, but given the current situation it was understandable as to why we were being pushed back. Again, after 20 minutes we addressed another hostess just to be greeted very unprofessionally. She didn't want to even give us an estimate, after ensuring her that we could handle the knowledge of the true wait time. Again she refused to tell us and we went back to the seating area to wait again. Luckily, within a few minutes our pager started buzzing, but instead of having a table for us, we were told it was an accident and that they didn't even have a table for us. They then apologized and tried to frantically find us a table that wasn't even supposed to be available for us. They then brought us to a table that usually is meant to seat 4 (we had a party of 6). We noticed another party of 2 next to us was just about to leave so we asked  if we could just push the tables together to have proper seating. They replied, no we can not but if you'd like you can go back into the lobby and wait another 45 minutes or so. Which meant to me that ultimately the 30 minute wait that we were first given was somewhere closer to an hour and a half long. They were essentially low balling us on the wait time to keep us here instead of waiting. Had we known that the wait would be about 4 hours long rather than 2 hours we would have never came here in the first place, and they know that. So, for the sake of making money, the cheesecake factory purposely doesn't give realistic estimates. They've done it to us before, but nothing as ridiculous as this.

We would've sat at the outside patio but it was raining before so all the tables and seats were wet.  I ordered the Fried Chicken and Waffles Benedict, because I actually had this at a restaurant in New York (called Friedman's, check out my other review) so I wanted to see how it compared to the Cheesecake Factory. I was really surprised when it came out because it wasn't what I expected. Rather than pieces of fried chicken, it was chicken strips which really lowered my expectations. The side of potatoes were a really nice touch, and they weren't salty which I liked. The creaminess of the poached egg and hollandaise sauce was a really nice balance to the saltiness of the chicken strips. My friend ordered the Bruleed French Toast, and HOLY this thing was huge. It's not like your regular french toast, it was more like french baguette...Unlike a baguette though, these wee INCREDIBLY soft and fluffy. I highly recommend this!

3248,Rachel S.,"Pleasanton, CA",757,549,286.0,3.0,2017-01-03,"Macys and Cheesecake Factory go hand in hand, with the American chain culture. It's no wonder that they have a CF at the top of Macy's in San Francisco's busiest high end shopping area of the city. It's been a long time since I've been here, high school with my mom for lunch. Even then, we didn't have a long wait because the lunch hour rush isn't as crazy as the holiday, weekend crowd. My family isn't too big on CF, but they wanted to come here for the view.  My twin's birthdays were last Friday, which is the 30th of December. Union Square, Macy's included were still set up for the holidays. We went to Japantown and then we headed to Union Square. I did a Google search for cheap parking around the area and since it was after 6PM, the parking was averaged to $6 total. Whaaaat, that is crazy! I was expecting that we'd be paying a minimum of $20 for the parking alone. Waze took us down a shorter way to the parking lot (because the streets were a parking lot as well) and we arrived about 15 minutes from leaving Japantown.  It was 7:05 to be exact when we went to go put down our names for the wait list. He said that it would be about 3 1/2 hours. We bit the bullet and waited. It was prime time traffic on a Friday out of the city, no way would it do us any good sitting in the car. The time on the ticket that was given to us actually said to be back around 9:56PM, so three hours, take off a half an hour.  By 9:45, we were all over hanging out around Union Square. We had visited the Starbucks on the fourth floor, walked around Union Square and watched some people fall down ice skating. We went to the Disney Store and Old Navy down on Market and still had about an hour to kill before we could even head up. By the time that we went up, it was 10PM. There was a line of people waiting to make a reservation, I suppose. There were other people waiting in a line off to the side, handing their white ticket to the lady behind the counter. Some were seated right away, others were handed a buzzer. I was handed a buzzer. We scored seats in the little room that is between the indoor and outdoor seating. People were out looking at the view, I decided to wait for that until after we were done eating. We waited about 10 minutes before the buzzer started going off. The server that we had was really nice. I don't remember his name, but it took him a few minutes to come around and take drink orders...but once he came by, he was very attentive during our dining. We ordered appetizers, cheese sticks and mini crab bites. They didn't have anymore cheese sticks though and my twins didn't want anything else...so we just went with the mini crab bites.  The time for the food to come out was pretty average, it wasn't that long. One of my twin's daughter's meals came out incorrectly. The waiter offered her a soup or salad on the house, but she didn't want anything. The order came out correctly and we all enjoyed our meals. We ordered a piece of cheesecake and a few of the waiters came over and sung Happy Birthday to our twins. One of them sung really off key and I thought it was hilarious. I'm not sure if he always does that or if he did it because I said ""they're now teenagers""...but we all thought it was funny. Overall, would we come here for a random night? No, we wouldn't wait three hours to eat food at a restaurant that we could dine at closer to our house. I would say that the dining experience outside during the summer, is probably amazing. Even with the heaters outside, that is too cold for my liking! But the view is amazing and if you like dessert, this is a great place to come.

First, the line was INSANE. Like 1.5 hours for a table. Not sure if it's regularly that bad or because it was holiday weekend. We got a table outside quicker because we were fine with it. We could suffer through the cold.  The menu is ridiculous. They have everything. And lots of it. We decided to go all in and eat junky. We had a few fried appetizers then decided on burgers and fries. We're vegetarian but they substituted veggie burgers into another burger combo with no problems. It was fantastically unhealthy food.  Feeling absolutely stuffed, we still got a slice of cheesecake which is the size of a full meal there!  I'd 100% go back if we were in sf and we're craving a spot like this.

3049,Vivian L.,"San Francisco, CA",49,12,7.0,4.0,2017-01-05,"One of my go-to restaurants when I'm shopping around Union Square and can't find a nice place to eat.  Unfortunately, a major downfall is the Cheesecake Factory does not take reservations. The several times I've been here, I've always had to wait at least 20 minutes for a table, and that's on a good day. The wait and amount of people is absolutely insane during busier hours and the holidays. Definitely not the place to go if you don't have a lot of time to kill.  Otherwise, I think it's a good date spot to pick that isn't too expensive, has friendly customer service, and a large sized portions for meals. They always serve a couple of loaves of bread, along with quality butter, after they take your menu. This is a huge plus for me, since the actual order can take somewhat long to get to your table. Sitting outside is also really nice, especially when while the sun is setting. It's a little too cold to be sitting outside during the winter, but spring/summer is fine, and there are a few outdoor heaters. From my several visits, I've had:  Shephard's Pie: A huge plate of beef and veggies, topped with mashed potatoes and a parmesan cheese crust. Super filling and tasty, though I wish the meal instead came as a smaller portion with a variety of other sides to make it more interesting. Pasta Carbonara: I've ordered this the most! I love the creamy, cheesey sauce, and thin noodles. My default pasta choice. The server always asks if additional parmesan on top is preferred.  Factory Burrito Grande: A really, really huge burrito with different sauces on the side, and for $15! Pretty good and extremely filling - I got through a third and had to take the rest to go.  Godiva Chocolate Brownie Sundae: My favorite dessert! For $9, this is a really delicious, rich brownie sundae. On one occasion, I've come here looking to ONLY eat dessert, which was totally fine. The plate is huge, and even shared between two people, it's enough to make you full.  Lemon Raspberry Cheesecake: My favorite pick of cheesecake, I have a thing for tangy, tart desserts. Overall, I think their cheesecakes are a bit pricey per slice, as the slice is also quite small, but if you've never tried it before, it's worth buying a slice or two.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=240,3.12,2.56,2.668,2.6719999999999997,2.7840000000000003

What's so special about this one? 8th floor outdoor rooftop of Macy's in DT SF, that's what! The view of union square is worth the wait, doesn't matter if you're a tourist or local. Heating lamps for those always cold folks or opt for dining indoors. Take the special elevator directly up or save time waiting and use 7 sets of escalators to view what Macy's women's/home has to offer. Take note of Starbucks on the 4th floor, Burger Bar on the 6th, and Boudin/Jamba/etc. in the basement. 35 min wait for two at 9pm Saturday night for outdoor seating! Time went by relatively fast but boy was the atrium packed! There was one rude hostess that obviously needed to go home and take a chill pill, but everyone else was polite. Someone probably told her to take a break cuz she disappeared for 20 min. Sometimes I forget how many tourists there are in the city; hosts ask for a US phone # and many didn't have one. Another observation: the bill holder has a card explaining customary tips in the US. Must be nice for servers to be paid better than minimum wage in the U.K. and elsewhere. Patrizah A. took great care of us-- super sweet and cheerful with a genuine smile, checked back at the right times and offered cheesecake recommendations since they discontinued white chocolate blueberry. The new cold brew Coffee & Cream Chocolate Supreme is a hit with caffeine lovers. Ultimate Red Velvet! Window seats! Our original table wasn't clean so we got better ones on the left side with fewer people around. Those seats got filled right before we left at 11! 12:30am closing time on weekends.  Food! I tried something new but similar to my Chicken Bellagio. Ordered the Louisiana chicken pasta with crisp coated thinly pound chicken atop mildly spicy bow tie Cajun pasta with mushrooms and bell peppers. Yum! Couldn't finish this 2200 cal dish (oh heck no, half was for the next day) since I cleaned out my little Caesar salad and indulged in calamari.

Ambiance: I usually get seated on the right side of the restaurant, but I got seated at the left side near the bar. There is less light on this side. However, I could see the outdoor balcony and the rustic decorations set the perfect mood. The food: REALLY GOOD. Or I was just really hungry. I ordered the chicken marsala pasta. Reeeaaally good. We also got a margarita pizza which I could not get enough of. Tip #1: The wait isn't so bad when you spend it a floor below the factory in the Furniture department of Macy's. The workers are friendly and hide their annoyance very well. I recommend choosing leather couches that recline. 10/10. Tip #2: Order a strawberry lemonade. Unlimited refills, sugar at the rim, YUMMY.  Tip #3: Keep refilling the heavenly brown bread. It'll make you too full to order the cheesecake thus saving money which can be used to pay the meter.

We were in the corner and was frustrated to see 4 people grouped together and no one offering any help when I'm raising my hand. I felt like it took a long time to receive our food too. Thank god for the bread they served or we would have been starving. When the food arrived, it arrived cold. Our server must have left it up there for sometime. He failed to provide us all with silverware. I had to get up to get my own silverware because no one would come by. The food was not to par. Most of the food was left on our plates. Needless to say, the service and food sucked! It was an expensive mistake!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=240,2.84,2.56,2.668,1.988,2.672

I ordered white chili which was 86'd and Tex mex egg rolls that were at least crunchy- but so gross it was hard to even choke one down. I'm certain if I presented that to the person who cooked and let that leave the kitchen- that person would chew backward into a napkin removing that salt bomb from the palate. I'm certain the small amount I ingested will irritate my stomach. How can you NOT know you're sending that out? Ewww. Of course the cheesecake- Original with hot fudge on the side.....amazing.

3186,Joshua M.,"San Francisco, CA",161,407,1538.0,2.0,2017-01-12,"On the upper floor of the SF downtown Macy's lies The Cheesecake Factory. Being in such a prime location, the wait can be especially long during peak hours. I've come here twice or so over the previous year and have found it to be rather mediocre overall.  The service was not great, but not terribly bad as well. The food however always ends up being especially bland despite its nice and flavorful appearance. Their fried appetizers are somewhat decent with good heat and crisp, but their pasta tends to be overcooked such that there is a lack of firmness. I've tried another Cheesecake Factory branch in the past and find this establishment to be quite lacking in food quality compared to it. The cheesecake here is quite disappointing as well with it being a mush that tastes of cream and sugar without much substance and depth of flavor. The main positive of this restaurant has to be its location though. If you're able to get an outdoor seat for lunch on a nice sunny day in SF then you'll be treated to a wonderful view of union square though more often or not, there's going to be construction going on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=40,2.8,2.57,2.692,1.9920000000000002,2.662

When I arrived there were about 6 hosts behind the desk standing by.  I approached a young skinny Indian guy and requested a table for 3.

While that moment is gone and we still had the bad experience, we appreciate the fact the fact that they reached out to us to correct the problem.  Wish I could give this place negative stars. Waited 1 hour and 15 minutes for a table. That was understandable because my wife and I came in on a Saturday night at 7:25pm, and it was already a mad house. After our buzzer goes off, we have to stand to the side, and wait an additional 15 minutes. Ok fine whatever, at least we're at the table now.

It's our go-to place when we are shopping in the city because it's easy and there are lots of choices. I loved this place until the last three times we've eaten here, which have all been bad. So, after our last visit here this weekend I think we won't be coming back again. Sad. We had bad service and bad food. I wouldn't normally give this place a one star review but it was bad three times in a row. UGH.  The service was SLOW. And our server (Glendi? not sure of her name) was bored by our presence and totally inefficient. We asked for water, and she brought one. Had to ask for another one. She never asked if I wanted another drink after I finished my drink. She didn't refill ice tea until asked. Just totally nonchalant about everything. I would give the service a D. But, and the end when she brought our bill, she made sure to put a notation on the receipt that ""tip is not included."" Duh. And rude.  My husband ordered the club sandwich. It was DRY AS A BONE. Burnt toast that looked and tasted like it had been under the warmer far too long. (C'mon, how do you ruin a club sandwich?) I ordered the Orange Chicken with rice and vegetables. Basically, we all know that this is breaded fried chicken pieces that they put in different sauces so I know what I'm getting. I've ordered it before also. Well, the chicken was also DRY AS A BONE. It looked like they drizzled a tiny bit of orange sauce over the chicken after it was already on the plate. Weird right??? So I waited 10-15 minutes for her to come back and I asked for a side of orange chicken sauce to put on my food. She comes back with this dish of sauce that had EXACTLY one teaspoon of extra sauce. I'm not even kidding. So I gave up. And I gnawed on my chicken. Gross.  We had two lunch entrees, two pieces of cheesecake, on daiquiri and one ice tea. It was $75.00.  NO. NO.

For desert, we had lattes & a piece of caramel cheesecake to share, I must say that my individually wrapped instant coffee taste 100% better than their coffee, but of course needless to say that the cheesecake was super good.

We ordered The Cheesecake Factory through Postmates twice at this location and will never return again. The first time we ordered, we just wanted cheesecake. There was an option on the Postmates website to pay an extra $1 for a ""large"" slice of cheesecake. We'd never heard of this, so since we were sharing we said sure, and paid the extra amount. When we got our order we discovered that not only was the cheesecake not bigger, it was actually much, much smaller than normal. We were pretty upset so we called the restaurant. We got a super ignorant ""manager"" that said he'd known for quite sometime that there was an option for a larger slice, but that there was no such thing. When we asked why this hadn't been changed on the Postmastes website his response was ""Well that isn't really my problem."" Okay. Unsatisfied with his cavalier attitude, we asked to speak with his superior. He left us on hold for THIRTY MINUTES before connecting us with someone else. We spoke at length with a nice guy who was also a manager, explained the situation, and he listened to us, documented our concerns, and offered to send us a small gift card as an apology. Beyond the monetary gift, we were happy to see our concerns addressed and were overall satisfied with the conversation, even enough so to order again just a few days later. Fast-forward a couple of days and we ordered a slice of cheesecake, crabcake bites, and edamame.

3727,Rachel S.,"Pleasanton, United States",757,549,286.0,3.0,2017-03-01,"Macys and Cheesecake Factory go hand in hand, with the American chain culture. It's no wonder that they have a CF at the top of Macy's in San Francisco's busiest high end shopping area of the city. It's been a long time since I've been here, high school with my mom for lunch. Even then, we didn't have a long wait because the lunch hour rush isn't as crazy as the holiday, weekend crowd. My family isn't too big on CF, but they wanted to come here for the view.  My twin's birthdays were last Friday, which is the 30th of December. Union Square, Macy's included were still set up for the holidays. We went to Japantown and then we headed to Union Square. I did a Google search for cheap parking around the area and since it was after 6PM, the parking was averaged to $6 total. Whaaaat, that is crazy! I was expecting that we'd be paying a minimum of $20 for the parking alone. Waze took us down a shorter way to the parking lot (because the streets were a parking lot as well) and we arrived about 15 minutes from leaving Japantown.  It was 7:05 to be exact when we went to go put down our names for the wait list. He said that it would be about 3 1/2 hours. We bit the bullet and waited. It was prime time traffic on a Friday out of the city, no way would it do us any good sitting in the car. The time on the ticket that was given to us actually said to be back around 9:56PM, so three hours, take off a half an hour.  By 9:45, we were all over hanging out around Union Square. We had visited the Starbucks on the fourth floor, walked around Union Square and watched some people fall down ice skating. We went to the Disney Store and Old Navy down on Market and still had about an hour to kill before we could even head up. By the time that we went up, it was 10PM. There was a line of people waiting to make a reservation, I suppose. There were other people waiting in a line off to the side, handing their white ticket to the lady behind the counter. Some were seated right away, others were handed a buzzer. I was handed a buzzer. We scored seats in the little room that is between the indoor and outdoor seating. People were out looking at the view, I decided to wait for that until after we were done eating. We waited about 10 minutes before the buzzer started going off. The server that we had was really nice. I don't remember his name, but it took him a few minutes to come around and take drink orders...but once he came by, he was very attentive during our dining. We ordered appetizers, cheese sticks and mini crab bites. They didn't have anymore cheese sticks though and my twins didn't want anything else...so we just went with the mini crab bites.  The time for the food to come out was pretty average, it wasn't that long. One of my twin's daughter's meals came out incorrectly. The waiter offered her a soup or salad on the house, but she didn't want anything. The order came out correctly and we all enjoyed our meals. We ordered a piece of cheesecake and a few of the waiters came over and sung Happy Birthday to our twins. One of them sung really off key and I thought it was hilarious. I'm not sure if he always does that or if he did it because I said ""they're now teenagers""...but we all thought it was funny. Overall, would we come here for a random night? No, we wouldn't wait three hours to eat food at a restaurant that we could dine at closer to our house. I would say that the dining experience outside during the summer, is probably amazing. Even with the heaters outside, that is too cold for my liking! But the view is amazing and if you like dessert, this is a great place to come. For our time being in the city and what we were celebrating, it was great.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=80,2.6,2.64,2.64,2.7,2.624

Me and my family arrived to have a nice dinner, we waited 56 min (!!) which we've been told it will take 40-50 min and it was ok, we approach the lady in the desk (blond and young) to ask if anything change and she ignore us brutally! After my brother and my brother in law tried with no success I approached her and she completely ignore me and told me that I interrupt her, without saying a word!!

There was another incident where the mother and daughter felt uncomfortable with the, rather homeless-looking guy, sitting next to them and they had a hard time getting their waiter's attention.  The only real issue I have with this CF is that sometimes we'd wait for a long time to be buzzed and seated but come in to see that half the tables were empty.

I have not been to a Cheesecake Factory in maybe 12 years or so and was hesitant. But, friends wanted to go and there are not a ton of family friendly options downtown SF. So, we went. First, the line was INSANE. Like 1.5 hours for a table. Not sure if it's regularly that bad or because it was holiday weekend. We got a table outside quicker because we were fine with it. We could suffer through the cold.  The menu is ridiculous. They have everything. And lots of it. We decided to go all in and eat junky. We had a few fried appetizers then decided on burgers and fries. We're vegetarian but they substituted veggie burgers into another burger combo with no problems. It was fantastically unhealthy food.  Feeling absolutely stuffed, we still got a slice of cheesecake which is the size of a full meal there!  I'd 100% go back if we were in sf and we're craving a spot like this.

So, after our last visit here this weekend I think we won't be coming back again. Sad. We had bad service and bad food. I wouldn't normally give this place a one star review but it was bad three times in a row. UGH.  The service was SLOW. And our server (Glendi? not sure of her name) was bored by our presence and totally inefficient. We asked for water, and she brought one. Had to ask for another one. She never asked if I wanted another drink after I finished my drink. She didn't refill ice tea until asked. Just totally nonchalant about everything. I would give the service a D. But, and the end when she brought our bill, she made sure to put a notation on the receipt that ""tip is not included."" Duh. And rude.  My husband ordered the club sandwich. It was DRY AS A BONE. Burnt toast that looked and tasted like it had been under the warmer far too long. (C'mon, how do you ruin a club sandwich?) I ordered the Orange Chicken with rice and vegetables. Basically, we all know that this is breaded fried chicken pieces that they put in different sauces so I know what I'm getting. I've ordered it before also. Well, the chicken was also DRY AS A BONE. It looked like they drizzled a tiny bit of orange sauce over the chicken after it was already on the plate. Weird right??? So I waited 10-15 minutes for her to come back and I asked for a side of orange chicken sauce to put on my food. She comes back with this dish of sauce that had EXACTLY one teaspoon of extra sauce. I'm not even kidding. So I gave up. And I gnawed on my chicken. Gross.  We had two lunch entrees, two pieces of cheesecake, on daiquiri and one ice tea. It was $75.00.  NO. NO. NO.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=20,3.16,2.74,2.632,2.212,2.9080000000000004

However after last night I don't think I'll be visiting this location anymore. We experienced: -Horrible service, first off the host wouldn't seat one of our groups when the rest was on their way up  then he walked her halfway and then back saying he can't walk her there yet. Right after another host walked her to her table with no problem. Secondly, our waiter barely came by and one of our eater cups were leaked so there was water ALL OVER THE TABLE and when we mentioned it she Brought TWO table clothes and handed it to me to clean then lied to her manager and said I wanted to clean it myself??? Even when they brought out the food she came looked at our food and walked away without even asking if we needed anything else. Nobody did until we asked a random waiter walking by. -A rude and inconsiderate manager. She gave us attitude when we were being nice at first which wasn't professional at all. We had family from Europe and I was going on about how much he would enjoy his food here and after he ate a few bites I noticed he was only eating the chicken and not his pasta so I tasted his and it had no salt at all whatsoever (mind that my own food didn't have any salt either but i just ate it because I was hungry and I can always order it again another time). We told the waiter and so the manager came and said since he already ate half of it they can only make him half a plate  and charge full or not being anything and charge for a lunch portion when in reality he only ate the chicken and a few of his pasta. She was being rude and basically had us pay a lunch portion when he ate less than that because he lost his appetite at that point. VERY DISAPPOINTING! Don't recommend this location! Just go to another location if you want to enjoy this place.

This particular one is extra nice because it's located on the top floor of Macy's which overlooks Union Square. The view up here is absolutely amazing. With that said, this also means it's quite a touristy spot and it's crazy crowded. They gave a buzzer for when your table is ready, which allowed us to wander around the floors only to wait some more even after our buzzer went off. It's a Monday night and somehow still incredibly packed. We ended up sitting inside, which got quite stuffy. It also didn't help with how hot it got as we shared a bottle of wine. One of my favorites here has to be their complimentary bread, especially the honey oat one --yum! Make sure to ask for extra of those. Between the two of us, we ordered to share the Crab Cake Bites ($8), Louisiana Chicken Pasta ($18), and Steak Diane ($29). Everything was yummy and came in huge portions! I know the menu gets intimidating here, but my go-to has and will always be the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. Since we were so stuffed, it didn't leave us room for the cheesecake.

3888,Vivian L.,"San Francisco, United States",49,12,7.0,4.0,2017-05-01,"One of my go-to restaurants when I'm shopping around Union Square and can't find a nice place to eat.  Unfortunately, a major downfall is the Cheesecake Factory does not take reservations. The several times I've been here, I've always had to wait at least 20 minutes for a table, and that's on a good day. The wait and amount of people is absolutely insane during busier hours and the holidays. Definitely not the place to go if you don't have a lot of time to kill.  Otherwise, I think it's a good date spot to pick that isn't too expensive, has friendly customer service, and a large sized portions for meals. They always serve a couple of loaves of bread, along with quality butter, after they take your menu. This is a huge plus for me, since the actual order can take somewhat long to get to your table. Sitting outside is also really nice, especially when while the sun is setting. It's a little too cold to be sitting outside during the winter, but spring/summer is fine, and there are a few outdoor heaters. From my several visits, I've had:  Shephard's Pie: A huge plate of beef and veggies, topped with mashed potatoes and a parmesan cheese crust. Super filling and tasty, though I wish the meal instead came as a smaller portion with a variety of other sides to make it more interesting. Pasta Carbonara: I've ordered this the most! I love the creamy, cheesey sauce, and thin noodles. My default pasta choice. The server always asks if additional parmesan on top is preferred.  Factory Burrito Grande: A really, really huge burrito with different sauces on the side, and for $15! Pretty good and extremely filling - I got through a third and had to take the rest to go.  Godiva Chocolate Brownie Sundae: My favorite dessert! For $9, this is a really delicious, rich brownie sundae. On one occasion, I've come here looking to ONLY eat dessert, which was totally fine. The plate is huge, and even shared between two people, it's enough to make you full.  Lemon Raspberry Cheesecake: My favorite pick of cheesecake, I have a thing for tangy, tart desserts. Overall, I think their cheesecakes are a bit pricey per slice, as the slice is also quite small, but if you've never tried it before, it's worth buying a slice or two.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=240,2.56,2.9,2.696,2.6079999999999997,2.7640000000000002

Cheesecake is always a good choice and we happened to pass it, so stopped in. The cheesecake was exactly as I remembered it - tasty. Our waiter was super nice and helpful. As we're sitting their waiting for our cheesecake, we're looking around and remembering why we aren't huge fans. They seat too many tables for one waiter. None of the vacant tables I saw had complete place settings. We were sitting at a 4-top, two of the seats had a full place setting, minus the napkins and included dirty appetizer-sized plates. The other two place settings included dirty app-sized plates and a fork and a spoon, and those two settings had napkins.  Decor.... seriously, I think that I've been to four different Cheesecake Factories and they all had the same decor. And we're talking YEARS in between the visits, my last one was in Scottsdale a couple of years ago. Before that was on the east coast easily 10+ years ago. I've never understood the decor. It's. Just. Boring. Sure, they have terrific cheesecake. Go there for the cheesecake. Tip your waiter well if that's all you get.

This would be my first visit to the Chandler Fashion Valley location.  As soon as we were seated, our assigned waitress rushed over to get our drink orders but failed to smile or even welcome us to the restaurant. Two short minutes later, she returned with two cups of water and admitted that she forgot what drinks were ordered. I repeated the drink order and she franticly rushed away. I saw a manager walking by and stopped her to request that we be assigned a new waitress only because I wasn't in the mood for a bad service that evening. The manager acted shocked and stated that the waitress serving us was her best. I was truly tempted to leave when I heard that only because the waitress was clearly not the best! The manager quickly assigned a new waiter to our table and he did everything possible to make sure we were satisfied. It is for only that reason alone I gave this location 2 stars. Other issues that were experienced were that the service was extremely slow, my daughters meal was never put into the order and the kitchen came out to apologize, and it nearly took 20 minutes just to pay the bill. Every Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to, the wait staff have been top-notch.

I waited about 45min and someone other then my waiter brought out my food. I noticed lots of bacon sticking out, so I mention that she must have the wrong table. She then informed me that that's what I ordered! I then told her I have never eaten bacon in my Whole life. She said well that's what you ordered, And walked away. I then asked the next person I saw and asked her for my waiter, and she told me he was on a break. I told her the situation, she left, came back and said he put in a bacon burger. She then left as well. At no time did anybody offer to get me what I wanted. My server came back and I informed him, her was very sorry for the mistake. At this point I had ate the fries but nothing else. He offered to replace my burger, I told him I couldn't wait any longer for what I had ordered. I brought me the check and offered me some cheesecake. He made it sound like he was going to give it to me for the mistake. I asked for it to go, he then gave me the cheesecake, and my check.

This restaurant has completely failed in customer service &  the food quality department without a doubt..  we waited & waited & waited & then waited some more...   we waited to be seated for ages. We Decided  we would go to the bar and have a drink to pass the time. Upon arriving at the bar, the seats were all full with people eating there dinners. there was no place for us to even order a drink.. surely they are losing more business/money by feeding people at the bar that stay there for a long time, then to serve people an over priced drink that move along quit quickly.. so after being seated without getting the drinks we wanted, we decided then that we were put  off the cocktails & would just have soda.. upon ordering the drinks, we were told that they didn't have any soft drinks available do to the fact that the machine had broke  REALLY?!?! Unbelievable!!  So we waited for what seemed like days for our water that we ordered to be served. we waited again for our food that was not as described on the menu &  was  served slightly warmer then room temperature. Upon notifying our waitress about our issues with the food, you'll never guess that she actually asked us to WAIT again.. she said we needed to wait to talk to her manager. Reluctantly we sat and waited some more. About 15-20 min before we just got up and left.. We waited ALL that time without complaining & then waited some more & the manager we were waiting for never even came out in the 15-20 that we sat there waiting for them..  Needless to say, We will never be returning to Cheesecake Factory anytime in the near future & definitely never again to this one!!!

They don't have reservations, so on a Saturday night in December the wait was 1.5-2 hours for 2 people!! Bar is open seating though, so we sat there. I got a martini to drink, which was really good and had blue cheese stuffed olives NOM. For my main dish, I got the angel hair pasta with shrimp. I've had it before, it's only okay. Not super flavorful and the shrimp was definitely overcooked. However, I love the thinness of angel hair pasta. My boyfriend got the chicken and shrimp curry which I tried. It was pretty good, but heavy. I couldn't eat a whole plate of it. Overall, Cheesecake Factory is a good place for a not too expensive meal, so great for families.

2986,Kirsten V.,"Vacaville, CA",28,44,24.0,1.0,2017-05-20,"We've been to this restaurant many times while staying downtown and this was the worst. We had the usual Saturday night wait of an hour and then more waiting for the food. My husband had the wrong burger brought out which was rectified when the server showed up with the right one.  However my daughter's pasta never showed up. When the server realized he disappeared for a while and when he came back asked if the manager had stopped by. Nope. NEVER heard word one from the manager. NEVER offered any compensation for waiting another half hour for her meal to show up. Rather than wait any longer or ask for the manager to make an appearance we paid the bill and left. I usually try not to dock the waiter for a kitchen screw up, but felt we had no choice this time.

We had the usual Saturday night wait of an hour and then more waiting for the food. My husband had the wrong burger brought out which was rectified when the server showed up with the right one.  However my daughter's pasta never showed up. When the server realized he disappeared for a while and when he came back asked if the manager had stopped by. Nope. NEVER heard word one from the manager. NEVER offered any compensation for waiting another half hour for her meal to show up. Rather than wait any longer or ask for the manager to make an appearance we paid the bill and left. I usually try not to dock the waiter for a kitchen screw up, but felt we had no choice this time.

Their complementary bread came fast and as soon as we were done with that, our appetizer came. The fried zucchini was amazing. Now I know it might not sound so good, but it was so amazing where I'd say it can curve your tastebuds for chicken nuggets/tenders. After we finished that, our food took super long to come out. Waited at least 30 minutes to come to us only to find out our food has been sitting there. When I tried to dig in to my pasta, I couldn't. The pasta was so dry and hard and the food was lukewarm.

2939,Greg C.,"Castle Rock, WA",4,27,6.0,4.0,2017-06-14,"I get teased a bit for going somewhere and eating at a chain restaurant, rather than a local place. I lived an hour from any chain restaurants (other than a Red Lobster -- disgusting) so that's why I had that mentality. Now that I live in the Bay Area, I have plenty of options and am trying local places more often. When I went into The City two days ago, however, I did meet up with a friend for lunch at The Cheesecake Factory.  This location is really cool, in my opinion, and the two times I've eaten here, I ate outside overlooking Union Square -- great views from up there on either side of the Macy's sign (no, literally!).  I ordered the Georgia Peach cocktail, as recommended by the server when I asked, and the Louisiana Chicken Pasta (also recommended when asked). Both were absolutely delicious. ZERO regrets. I am a big guy, I hadn't eaten breakfast, and wasn't eating lunch here until after 1 PM. I ordered the lunch sized pasta and STILL had leftovers to take home. That brown bread (What IS that bread? There's a debate online, and there's too many different answers!) may be the best thing here, honestly. That's not meant as an insult, but I've never tasted a better bread in my life.  My complaints here are as follows: the staff at the check in counter. They are a little ""gossipy"" and are clearly discussing others in whispered voices, looking around, and then giggling about it. That doesn't make one comfortable and is quite unprofessional. The other complaint/issue (and it's not even the fault of The Cheesecake Factory) is that if you sit outside, there will be birds flying VERY close to you/around you often. They also walk all over the tables and eat at the food left behind by customers. It just seems a little bothersome and unsanitary.

There's a debate online, and there's too many different answers!) may be the best thing here, honestly. That's not meant as an insult, but I've never tasted a better bread in my life.  My complaints here are as follows: the staff at the check in counter. They are a little ""gossipy"" and are clearly discussing others in whispered voices, looking around, and then giggling about it. That doesn't make one comfortable and is quite unprofessional. The other complaint/issue (and it's not even the fault of The Cheesecake Factory) is that if you sit outside, there will be birds flying VERY close to you/around you often. They also walk all over the tables and eat at the food left behind by customers. It just seems a little bothersome and unsanitary. However, I did ask to sit outside.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=100,3.24,2.9,2.828,2.384,3.0360000000000005

What's so special about this one? 8th floor outdoor rooftop of Macy's in DT SF, that's what! The view of union square is worth the wait, doesn't matter if you're a tourist or local. Heating lamps for those always cold folks or opt for dining indoors. Take the special elevator directly up or save time waiting and use 7 sets of escalators to view what Macy's women's/home has to offer. Take note of Starbucks on the 4th floor, Burger Bar on the 6th, and Boudin/Jamba/etc. in the basement. 35 min wait for two at 9pm Saturday night for outdoor seating! Time went by relatively fast but boy was the atrium packed! There was one rude hostess that obviously needed to go home and take a chill pill, but everyone else was polite. Someone probably told her to take a break cuz she disappeared for 20 min. Sometimes I forget how many tourists there are in the city; hosts ask for a US phone # and many didn't have one. Another observation: the bill holder has a card explaining customary tips in the US. Must be nice for servers to be paid better than minimum wage in the U.K. and elsewhere. Patrizah A. took great care of us-- super sweet and cheerful with a genuine smile, checked back at the right times and offered cheesecake recommendations since they discontinued white chocolate blueberry. The new cold brew Coffee & Cream Chocolate Supreme is a hit with caffeine lovers. Ultimate Red Velvet! Window seats! Our original table wasn't clean so we got better ones on the left side with fewer people around. Those seats got filled right before we left at 11! 12:30am closing time on weekends.  Food! I tried something new but similar to my Chicken Bellagio. Ordered the Louisiana chicken pasta with crisp coated thinly pound chicken atop mildly spicy bow tie Cajun pasta with mushrooms and bell peppers. Yum! Couldn't finish this 2200 cal dish (oh heck no, half was for the next day) since I cleaned out my little Caesar salad and indulged in calamari. Sophie N. got the Angel hair pasta with shrimp, asparagus add on. Succulent shrimp! Strange how this dish is listed as Garlic Lemon Shrimp online, asparagus already added in.

One of my favorites is the Chicken Bellagio. It's a really delicious chicken pesto dish. Hard to find these days. The drinks are always great and it's all reasonably priced.

She ended up going with the carne asada steak medallions. One the menu it said it would come with rice and fresh corn. The dish did not come with anything but the carne asada plate. Multiple people told us it didn't come with rice but that was literally all my mom was looking at on the menu when she ordered.

However after last night I don't think I'll be visiting this location anymore. We experienced: -Horrible service, first off the host wouldn't seat one of our groups when the rest was on their way up  then he walked her halfway and then back saying he can't walk her there yet. Right after another host walked her to her table with no problem. Secondly, our waiter barely came by and one of our eater cups were leaked so there was water ALL OVER THE TABLE and when we mentioned it she Brought TWO table clothes and handed it to me to clean then lied to her manager and said I wanted to clean it myself??? Even when they brought out the food she came looked at our food and walked away without even asking if we needed anything else. Nobody did until we asked a random waiter walking by. -A rude and inconsiderate manager. She gave us attitude when we were being nice at first which wasn't professional at all. We had family from Europe and I was going on about how much he would enjoy his food here and after he ate a few bites I noticed he was only eating the chicken and not his pasta so I tasted his and it had no salt at all whatsoever (mind that my own food didn't have any salt either but i just ate it because I was hungry and I can always order it again another time). We told the waiter and so the manager came and said since he already ate half of it they can only make him half a plate  and charge full or not being anything and charge for a lunch portion when in reality he only ate the chicken and a few of his pasta. She was being rude and basically had us pay a lunch portion when he ate less than that because he lost his appetite at that point. VERY DISAPPOINTING! Don't recommend this location!

I went to this location with a group of 4 (including myself) after a long day at a conference. Our waitress never so much as cracked a smile and seemed rather annoyed that we were taking up space in her section. We all had empty glasses and only one of us got a refill and that was only because he specifically asked for one. She didn't even bring us back our check after we paid - another waiter brought it over, even though our waitress was clearly still working since she stopped by the table to next to us within minutes of our check coming back. We never got a single thank you (other than the scribble on the receipt) or any sign that we were welcome customers.

We were seated after about 25 minutes which wasn't that bad of a wait. Once we were seated, we ordered after waiting about 5-7 minutes. My boyfriend also ordered a beer when we ordered our food. After we were given our bread, I noticed that another couple got seated near us. About 30 minutes passed and we still didn't receive our food AND my boyfriend never even got his beer yet either. However, the couple that was seated AFTER us, they got their food already. We were starting to get a little irritated because we were very hungry. The manager came out and said that our food would take about 5 more minutes and he gave us a free soup to hold us off. There were many occasions that night where my boyfriend and I were just sitting around waiting for our waitress to come so we could ask about the beer, more bread, etc. The service that day wasn't that great. If it wasn't for the food being amazing, I would've given this place 1 or 2 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=300,2.88,2.85,2.884,2.284,2.862

The major difference in this one is that the food isn't the same and is slightly lower quality when compared to the one in Walnut Creek. If you're taking a date, there won't be an issue really, I just wouldn't go with a big group.

Like many Cheesecake locations, this place has its quirks. However, the food is good to very good the vast majority of the time, and the service here - unlike some other locations - is often spot on and more. In fact, it is unusual when I come here and find myself grousing about something. Having said that, let the review begin. This location is in the Macy's store at Union Square, up at the top - there is an elevator you can take (inside main entrance to your right), or you can slow journey up the many flights of escalators, taking in the various store floors as you go. As a note, if you arrive at a busy time, just hang out one floor down at the foot of the last escalators - lots of sofas on display, and if you're civil in behavior Macy's doesn't seem to mind if you park it for a little while; not sure the beeper reaches there, so leave someone upstairs if needed. This location has what I would call four dining zones - a bar, an area to the left of the bar (as you face it) and a larger room to the right, past the cheesecake display which tempts you upon entry. There is also an outdoor deck, but with limited shade, and with propane heaters for those summer days in SF! So, there is a bit of a choice of seating - tables or booths, as well. The menu is extensive (more than 250 items offered daily!) and does change in small ways now and then. Can't recommend anything, as I have too many favorites and you'd need several visits to try them for yourself. However, this last visit we had the Korean Fried Cauliflower (crispy cauliflower tossed with sweet and spicy sauce, toasted sesame seeds and green onion). First time for this, and of course, one of those rare issues - about 20 minutes after ordering a manager appeared (never a good sign) and said they were still making the sauce, so the dish would be a little delayed. Not a problem, except that the cauliflower arrived cold. Pretty sure it should have been warm-er. Still the taste was amazing, and although served with a ranch side (?!) the taste of the sauce was more than enough. Will have again! The other appetizer was the lightly breaded fried zucchini sticks, which I always enjoy - WITH the ranch side! We had salads for main entrees, a  Chinese Chicken Salad (chicken breast, rice noodles, lettuce, green onions, almonds, crisp wontons, bean sprouts, orange and sesame seeds, tossed in Chinese plum dressing. This was presented well, but the dressing (especially compared to other places we had this type of salad) was bland - no flavor whatever. Very disappointing. The other salad was the Cobb (with chicken and bacon on the side) and a sub of ranch dressing (which is a little tangy - try it!). Very good salad! And of course, we had to have cheesecake for dessert, and the Key Lime was perfect - tangy, tasty and not overwhelming in size. Don't forget the bread! What I call brown bread, and a sourdough type are offered - I only enjoy the brown bread, warm and soft!  I noticed the butter this visit was not offered in the usual foil wrapped pads, but a square in a small dish - forget to reorder? Not sure if this will become the regular way of serving butter, but if so -- note to manager -- PLEASE, let it get to room temperature before serving. Way too hard to spread, even on warm bread. Anyway, a couple of hiccups, unusual here at this location, but overall worthy of 4-stars. Service was attentive, polite, at times humorous and social, and professional.

3851,Rebecca B.,"San Francisco, United States",214,14,37.0,4.0,2017-10-01,"Never rate a place for their service unless they're blatantly racist.  The service: Could be better, but they're always busy so it's understandable and I could care less about shitty service. Food is FOOD.  Ambiance: I usually get seated on the right side of the restaurant, but I got seated at the left side near the bar. There is less light on this side. However, I could see the outdoor balcony and the rustic decorations set the perfect mood. The food: REALLY GOOD. Or I was just really hungry. I ordered the chicken marsala pasta. Reeeaaally good. We also got a margarita pizza which I could not get enough of. Tip #1: The wait isn't so bad when you spend it a floor below the factory in the Furniture department of Macy's. The workers are friendly and hide their annoyance very well. I recommend choosing leather couches that recline. 10/10. Tip #2: Order a strawberry lemonade. Unlimited refills, sugar at the rim, YUMMY.  Tip #3: Keep refilling the heavenly brown bread. It'll make you too full to order the cheesecake thus saving money which can be used to pay the meter.

I then asked the next person I saw and asked her for my waiter, and she told me he was on a break. I told her the situation, she left, came back and said he put in a bacon burger. She then left as well. At no time did anybody offer to get me what I wanted. My server came back and I informed him, her was very sorry for the mistake. At this point I had ate the fries but nothing else. He offered to replace my burger, I told him I couldn't wait any longer for what I had ordered.

This would be my first visit to the Chandler Fashion Valley location.  As soon as we were seated, our assigned waitress rushed over to get our drink orders but failed to smile or even welcome us to the restaurant. Two short minutes later, she returned with two cups of water and admitted that she forgot what drinks were ordered. I repeated the drink order and she franticly rushed away. I saw a manager walking by and stopped her to request that we be assigned a new waitress only because I wasn't in the mood for a bad service that evening. The manager acted shocked and stated that the waitress serving us was her best. I was truly tempted to leave when I heard that only because the waitress was clearly not the best! The manager quickly assigned a new waiter to our table and he did everything possible to make sure we were satisfied. It is for only that reason alone I gave this location 2 stars. Other issues that were experienced were that the service was extremely slow, my daughters meal was never put into the order and the kitchen came out to apologize, and it nearly took 20 minutes just to pay the bill.

They gave a buzzer for when your table is ready, which allowed us to wander around the floors only to wait some more even after our buzzer went off. It's a Monday night and somehow still incredibly packed. We ended up sitting inside, which got quite stuffy. It also didn't help with how hot it got as we shared a bottle of wine. One of my favorites here has to be their complimentary bread, especially the honey oat one --yum! Make sure to ask for extra of those. Between the two of us, we ordered to share the Crab Cake Bites ($8), Louisiana Chicken Pasta ($18), and Steak Diane ($29). Everything was yummy and came in huge portions! I know the menu gets intimidating here, but my go-to has and will always be the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. Since we were so stuffed, it didn't leave us room for the cheesecake.

Unbelievable!!  So we waited for what seemed like days for our water that we ordered to be served. we waited again for our food that was not as described on the menu &  was  served slightly warmer then room temperature. Upon notifying our waitress about our issues with the food, you'll never guess that she actually asked us to WAIT again.. she said we needed to wait to talk to her manager. Reluctantly we sat and waited some more. About 15-20 min before we just got up and left.. We waited ALL that time without complaining & then waited some more & the manager we were waiting for never even came out in the 15-20 that we sat there waiting for them..

I highly recommend sharing your meal with your friends, unless you're already planning on taking home leftovers. This Cheesecake Factory is located next to Union Square, and if you choose to dine outdoors, then you get a nice view that overlooks SF's most popular tourist attraction. We came here in early November, so the big tree and the ice rink was already set-up! The only major con about eating outdoors are all the pigeons, so if you're not a fan, then make sure you specify that you want indoor seating only. Since we came here on a Saturday afternoon, it was a standard 30-minute to 1-hour wait. When we were finally seated, we had an awesome waitress who had lots of energy and also gave us amazing service. For food, we started with the Factory Nachos, which was a huge nacho dish complete with guac, salsa, spicy chicken, jalapeños, and sour cream. We shared this amongst 4 people, and it was so good that it went away in less than 10 minutes. After our appetizer, my friend and I split the Factory Burger. It was super moist and packed with flavor, and describing it is making my taste buds water because it was so succulent!  Of course, we had to order a cheesecake to finish off our meal. We got the specialty birthday cake cheesecake, which tasted like a funfetti ice cream cake! ALSO, the complimentary bread that they serve always wins me over, especially the whole wheat.

I was also able to watch them interact with other customers and they were friendly and efficient with everyone.  The portions are very big. But the prices are affordable, especially for the amount of food. The bread they bring out before the meal is amazing! It's a wheat bread of some sort (maybe honey wheat) and it's warm.

Being in such a prime location, the wait can be especially long during peak hours. I've come here twice or so over the previous year and have found it to be rather mediocre overall.  The service was not great, but not terribly bad as well. The food however always ends up being especially bland despite its nice and flavorful appearance. Their fried appetizers are somewhat decent with good heat and crisp, but their pasta tends to be overcooked such that there is a lack of firmness. I've tried another Cheesecake Factory branch in the past and find this establishment to be quite lacking in food quality compared to it. The cheesecake here is quite disappointing as well with it being a mush that tastes of cream and sugar without much substance and depth of flavor. The main positive of this restaurant has to be its location though.

Wait time 30 min. Went by fast our hostess was accommodating as I requested a booth  FOOD SELECTION: Louisiana chicken pasta ask for parmesan cheese on top makes it taste even better  ( good choice) sooo good chicken nice and seasoned  sliced thin and cooked in a good sauce I would definitely order it again!!! Drinks raspberry lemon drop and typhoon punch both were very strong P.S. That's a good thing although the drinks are very expensive at least you will be tipsy!!!! the portions here are huge so brace yourself u will be very full especially if u order dinner and appetizers  CONCLUSION: our server JAKE was cool gave good drink and cheesecake  recommendations checked on us made sure everything was good ( unlike the terrible service in walnut creek) we enjoyed a nice dinner with a view and left full tipsy and satisfied we were pleased with everything can't wait to go back and explore the menu they have a nice assortment of food that I want to try this will be my go to place for casual dining,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=80,3.04,2.88,2.84,2.9640000000000004,2.9440000000000004

Not super flavorful and the shrimp was definitely overcooked. However, I love the thinness of angel hair pasta. My boyfriend got the chicken and shrimp curry which I tried.

Dec 8th, Friday, we had office lunch there, our server was very nice though,  but on our way out,we decided to get cheesecake for take out. We spent over $400 on lunch, the food was good, everything was fine  it's just that this guy at the counter was totally an a_ _! I ordered plain cheesecake,  he asked me if it's a slice, I said"" No, I want one whole round cheesecake"" He said ""What?"" I repeated myself and he said, ""Please elaborate"" and he moved the big cheesecake cardboard menu next to him to point to me the menu. As an order taker,  you should ask what size I want or tell me the sizes of cheesecake they carry, especially for customers who are not familiar with the sizes they carry-- they have 6 inches, 7 inches cake etc. Aside from that,  I waited a good 15 mins for my 6inch cheesecake order which I didnt really mind if he would have just said ""Thank you for waiting,  sorry about that, or have a nice day"" or whatever, but nothing, he just bagged the cheesecake and turned his back.

3639,Randall O.,"Hayward, United States",84,55,84.0,4.0,2017-12-11,"Came here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and left with a SUPER filled belly. I highly recommend sharing your meal with your friends, unless you're already planning on taking home leftovers. This Cheesecake Factory is located next to Union Square, and if you choose to dine outdoors, then you get a nice view that overlooks SF's most popular tourist attraction. We came here in early November, so the big tree and the ice rink was already set-up! The only major con about eating outdoors are all the pigeons, so if you're not a fan, then make sure you specify that you want indoor seating only. Since we came here on a Saturday afternoon, it was a standard 30-minute to 1-hour wait. When we were finally seated, we had an awesome waitress who had lots of energy and also gave us amazing service. For food, we started with the Factory Nachos, which was a huge nacho dish complete with guac, salsa, spicy chicken, jalapeños, and sour cream. We shared this amongst 4 people, and it was so good that it went away in less than 10 minutes. After our appetizer, my friend and I split the Factory Burger. It was super moist and packed with flavor, and describing it is making my taste buds water because it was so succulent!  Of course, we had to order a cheesecake to finish off our meal. We got the specialty birthday cake cheesecake, which tasted like a funfetti ice cream cake! ALSO, the complimentary bread that they serve always wins me over, especially the whole wheat. Overall, we had a great lunch at The Cheesecake Factory. If I come here next time, then I hope to get the same waitress (I actually forgot her name, but she had this unicorn pin!) because she was a real MVP!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2,2.76,2.91,2.792,3.024,2.8499999999999996

2895,Jennifer O.,"San Francisco, CA",633,662,1994.0,3.0,2017-12-20,"I normally don't do this.  I almost never ask to speak to a manager but after tonight's shenanigans in being seated, yeah, it was necessary. The Cheesecake Factory is deservedly busy, especially at this location on the top floor of Macy's Union Square, especially five days before Christmas. We only waited 40 minutes for a table, an estimate they accurately predicted. But as my little boy and I were led to the outdoor patio with beautiful holiday views of the Macy's Christmas tree, the skating rink and holiday lights in all the top drawer retailers' windows, the hostess led us to a table away from that view while 4-5 other tables were empty and service-ready.  I asked to be seated closer to the Union Square view. Hostess: ""Oh, those are reserved."" Me: ""Huh. They are? There's no designation."" Hostess: ""Well, they are. These two are reserved."" [Now highly suspicious and wondering why we were in this table push/pull] Me:  ""Well [pointing], how about this one?"" Hostess: ""That's reserved too, there's only this table."" Me: ""Well, what's the difference between THIS 4-top (hey, I waitressed my way through college, I got the lingo) and THIS one?"" Hostess: ""It's reserved."" Me: (Amused) ""No it's not."" Hostess: ""That's all we have, unless you want to wait another 30 minutes."" (Ok, now she threw down the gauntlet) Most people- especially hungry people avec child- would hear ""30 more minutes"" and fold at this point but not me. Me: ""Well...no one asked me if I wanted a *view* table, that if I did that it'd be a longer wait. Couldn't we just have *this table?"" Exasperated, she told us ""THAT'S what [she] was assigned"" (temper flaring) and asked us to follow her like naughty children being led to the principal's office. I looked at my child, he gave me a giggle, and we followed her... (Secret meeting at the reservation desk I wasn't privy to) A few moments later, she told us to follow her and  we were led back onto the patio and wordlessly given the table that'd been open to begin with. So I sat there with my son talking about his day and admiring the view. But after a few minutes, I realized my irritation wouldn't dissipate.

3634,Jennifer O.,"San Francisco, United States",633,662,1994.0,3.0,2017-12-20,"I normally don't do this.  I almost never ask to speak to a manager but after tonight's shenanigans in being seated, yeah, it was necessary. The Cheesecake Factory is deservedly busy, especially at this location on the top floor of Macy's Union Square, especially five days before Christmas. We only waited 40 minutes for a table, an estimate they accurately predicted. But as my little boy and I were led to the outdoor patio with beautiful holiday views of the Macy's Christmas tree, the skating rink and holiday lights in all the top drawer retailers' windows, the hostess led us to a table away from that view while 4-5 other tables were empty and service-ready.  I asked to be seated closer to the Union Square view. Hostess: ""Oh, those are reserved."" Me: ""Huh. They are? There's no designation."" Hostess: ""Well, they are. These two are reserved."" [Now highly suspicious and wondering why we were in this table push/pull] Me:  ""Well [pointing], how about this one?"" Hostess: ""That's reserved too, there's only this table."" Me: ""Well, what's the difference between THIS 4-top (hey, I waitressed my way through college, I got the lingo) and THIS one?"" Hostess: ""It's reserved."" Me: (Amused) ""No it's not."" Hostess: ""That's all we have, unless you want to wait another 30 minutes."" (Ok, now she threw down the gauntlet) Most people- especially hungry people avec child- would hear ""30 more minutes"" and fold at this point but not me. Me: ""Well...no one asked me if I wanted a *view* table, that if I did that it'd be a longer wait. Couldn't we just have *this table?"" Exasperated, she told us ""THAT'S what [she] was assigned"" (temper flaring) and asked us to follow her like naughty children being led to the principal's office. I looked at my child, he gave me a giggle, and we followed her... (Secret meeting at the reservation desk I wasn't privy to) A few moments later, she told us to follow her and  we were led back onto the patio and wordlessly given the table that'd been open to begin with. So I sat there with my son talking about his day and admiring the view. But after a few minutes, I realized my irritation wouldn't dissipate. So I asked the server for the manager, reassuring it wasn't her, she was lovely. Waiting, I pulled up my LinkedIn message page and when the manager came by, I explained what happened and how much I admired The Cheesecake Factory who was for a long time my client, the #2 guy who'd helped build the restaurant group having left the company but I was still friendly with.

2893,Aubrey D.,"Fairfield, CA",356,413,571.0,2.0,2018-01-06,"I only want a slice of cheesecake, but why does this specific location makes ordering a slice so difficult? Oh wait... That's right! It's the ultimate tourist trap for all travelers and locals alike! Location: You can find the restaurant at the tippy top floor of the Macy's within San Francisco's Union Square. Just take an elevator and enjoy the 45 seconds of awkward silence as the elevator rushes people to the top. From there you will find a dimmed restaurant with thousands of tourists and disgruntled employees. On the other hand, good luck finding parking! Your best bet is to park inside one of the parking garages unless you're daring enough to walk 5-10 blocks from the area. Be prepared with some cash as some parking places take cash only. Setting: As I mentioned before, the CCF is at the tippy top floor of the gigantic Macy's. This place is great for a h-angry someone who ADORES waiting 20-120 minutes for a seat to dine-in. Not to mention ordering a slice of cheesecake to-go can be just as long as waiting for a seat to dine-in. While the views at the top are spectacular during the night time, there's seating inside of the restaurant and on the outdoor balcony. While this restaurant is noisy full of chatter from different patrons, if you're looking for a quiet and romantic dinner, I highly suggest you look elsewhere. Customer Service: I feel the pain for the employees who have to work twice as hard to ensure everyone is happy. However, I have to give them kudos for working at the busiest CCF on the planet. Despite all the patrons coming in and out of the restaurant, they do a pretty decent job at handling the crowd. On the other hand, if you only want a slice of cheesecake to-go, I recommend ordering through the phone instead of waiting in line to order something. Food: I only have the Chocolate Macadamia slice of cheesecake. It was BOMB, smooth, and nutty. Even though there's a HUGE chunk of whipped cream on the side, the cheesecake itself is best shared with two people. On the other hand, for the $8-9 a slice, it would be a better option to find a dessert place who sells the same thing at a lower price. Overall: Despite the high prices, tourists, and all the crazy schemes happening at this CCF location, I'll give it a plus for the views at the top. However, if I were you, I'd find somewhere else to eat in SF that serves decent cheesecake at a lower price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2,2.68,2.78,2.776,,2.74

They give you a ticket and tell you to report - only to give you a beeper so, they aren't really being honest about how long it takes. We had 2 kids so it was extra long for them.  Finally got seated and the waitress brought drinks. That was messed up - they brought the wrong drink for the youngest (who wanted tea but ended up with water).  While that was happening - I noticed my silverware was dirty (stuck on dried food) so everyone checked theirs and we came up with 3 dirty forks out of 6 and 2 knives. That's when we noticed that the table settings were incomplete and possibly someone had high-graded the settings (no napkins, no spoons, etc). We pointed out to the waitress and she reported it to the manager and brought all new place settings (good job here).  We ordered and after about 20 minutes, a guy walked up (did not introduce himself) to tell us there were no meatballs for my HB's spaghetti and did he want something else (causing more delays). at this time - we again complained about the dirty silverware. This guy seemed unimpressed and brushed us off to hustle away. When the waitress returned, we asked who the other person was and she said he was the Assistant Manager.  All-in-all, the food was good but the problems with the wait, silverware, and running out of food made this a bad experience.  At the end of the meal, we sort of expected some kind of discount on a drink or a meal but - when no concessions were made - my son got very angry and asked to see the manager.  Another long wait and some OTHER guy came over. He must have been the sacrificial lamb as he was NOT the manager or assistant.  He was nice enough but my son told him why we were upset.  We did say that it was not the waitresses fault in general.   SO - my advice is to wander up there for the view and then go somewhere else for food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=140,2.6,2.74,2.752,,2.684

But that's primarily because these arrogant workers are so used to clueless tourists and visitors just throwing money at them all because of the name brand and all because of the location, so they don't take pride in their customer service positions. They EXPECT business to always be busy and they EXPECT patrons to pay a lot of money and tip them no matter what the conditions are. That's the problem with most places these days. Luckily my recent visit wasn't all too bad.  I placed the to-go order over the phone for Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken, some type of smoked or spicy penne pasta with chicken I think (forgot what it was called), and two slices of cheesecake (and NO I didn't order all that food just to eat in one setting. I wanted enough for leftovers to eat over the next few days so I wouldn't have to cook. Busy week lol). Getting to the 8th floor is a bit of a hassle, you have to wait for the stupid elevator which is always crowded. There is definitely confusion on where exactly to pick up to-go orders so be sure to not be afraid to sternly make one of the 500 servers walking around doing nothing direct you where you need to go. By time I finally got the food and could bumrush to the front of the elevator line to hurry back down to the 1st floor, I was happy. The pastas were mediocre at best of course, but the CHEESECAKE, wow let me tell you, I was actually surprised at how good the cheesecake was.  I had a slice of the Red Velvet, and a slice of their 30th anniversary special cheesecake that was like a vanilla and chocolate marble mix. Both were SO creamy, SO decadent, SO delicious. And the question to be asked is why would you go to The Cheesecake Factory for anything other than cheesecake? In fact, they should stop trying to outdo themselves by having such a complicated menu and just serve Cheesecake and coffee only because their lack of organization (at this location especially) doesn't help anybody.  4 stars for the cheesecake ONLY. Oh, and 4 stars because the pasta portions for to-go were quite HUGE, considering the price.

But that's primarily because these arrogant workers are so used to clueless tourists and visitors just throwing money at them all because of the name brand and all because of the location, so they don't take pride in their customer service positions. They EXPECT business to always be busy and they EXPECT patrons to pay a lot of money and tip them no matter what the conditions are. That's the problem with most places these days. Luckily my recent visit wasn't all too bad.  I placed the to-go order over the phone for Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken, some type of smoked or spicy penne pasta with chicken I think (forgot what it was called), and two slices of cheesecake (and NO I didn't order all that food just to eat in one setting. I wanted enough for leftovers to eat over the next few days so I wouldn't have to cook. Busy week lol). Getting to the 8th floor is a bit of a hassle, you have to wait for the stupid elevator which is always crowded. There is definitely confusion on where exactly to pick up to-go orders so be sure to not be afraid to sternly make one of the 500 servers walking around doing nothing direct you where you need to go. By time I finally got the food and could bumrush to the front of the elevator line to hurry back down to the 1st floor, I was happy. The pastas were mediocre at best of course, but the CHEESECAKE, wow let me tell you, I was actually surprised at how good the cheesecake was.  I had a slice of the Red Velvet, and a slice of their 30th anniversary special cheesecake that was like a vanilla and chocolate marble mix. Both were SO creamy, SO decadent, SO delicious. And the question to be asked is why would you go to The Cheesecake Factory for anything other than cheesecake? In fact, they should stop trying to outdo themselves by having such a complicated menu and just serve Cheesecake and coffee only because their lack of organization (at this location especially) doesn't help anybody.  4 stars for the cheesecake ONLY. Oh, and 4 stars because the pasta portions for to-go were quite HUGE, considering the price. I hope they are like that everytime.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2,2.76,2.8,2.76,,2.784

My cousin from Germany came to visit so we decided to take her out to SF and eat at the infamous Cheesecake Factory with a view of the tree and ice skating rink. Our server name was Nicholas (Nick) and he was very kind and nice. He greeted us right away and brought us drinks as soon as he could since it was very busy. I love Cheesecake bread and butter so I asked for two baskets and without any hestitation he brought out two baskets! So nice! Other cheesecake factory tell me I can't or give me attitude. We ordered our food & got it very fresh and hot. His service was amazing, next time I come I want him again to be our server!

Sure, the view of Union Square is nice, but it took an hour and a half just to get a table for two on a random Tuesday evening. Once we were seated, service came by intermittently. The jambalaya pasta wasn't great or terrible, but I got a bad case of food poisoning the following day. If you're in the area, I'd just go to Bartlett Hall or Katana-Ya instead.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2,2.68,2.81,2.764,,2.758

3632,Aubrey D.,"Fairfield, United States",356,413,571.0,2.0,2018-06-01,"I only want a slice of cheesecake, but why does this specific location makes ordering a slice so difficult? Oh wait... That's right! It's the ultimate tourist trap for all travelers and locals alike! Location: You can find the restaurant at the tippy top floor of the Macy's within San Francisco's Union Square. Just take an elevator and enjoy the 45 seconds of awkward silence as the elevator rushes people to the top. From there you will find a dimmed restaurant with thousands of tourists and disgruntled employees. On the other hand, good luck finding parking! Your best bet is to park inside one of the parking garages unless you're daring enough to walk 5-10 blocks from the area. Be prepared with some cash as some parking places take cash only. Setting: As I mentioned before, the CCF is at the tippy top floor of the gigantic Macy's. This place is great for a h-angry someone who ADORES waiting 20-120 minutes for a seat to dine-in. Not to mention ordering a slice of cheesecake to-go can be just as long as waiting for a seat to dine-in. While the views at the top are spectacular during the night time, there's seating inside of the restaurant and on the outdoor balcony. While this restaurant is noisy full of chatter from different patrons, if you're looking for a quiet and romantic dinner, I highly suggest you look elsewhere. Customer Service: I feel the pain for the employees who have to work twice as hard to ensure everyone is happy. However, I have to give them kudos for working at the busiest CCF on the planet. Despite all the patrons coming in and out of the restaurant, they do a pretty decent job at handling the crowd. On the other hand, if you only want a slice of cheesecake to-go, I recommend ordering through the phone instead of waiting in line to order something. Food: I only have the Chocolate Macadamia slice of cheesecake. It was BOMB, smooth, and nutty. Even though there's a HUGE chunk of whipped cream on the side, the cheesecake itself is best shared with two people. On the other hand, for the $8-9 a slice, it would be a better option to find a dessert place who sells the same thing at a lower price. Overall: Despite the high prices, tourists, and all the crazy schemes happening at this CCF location, I'll give it a plus for the views at the top. However, if I were you, I'd find somewhere else to eat in SF that serves decent cheesecake at a lower price.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2,2.56,2.78,2.764,,2.692

Besides the fact that we spent 2 hours waiting for a table, everything else was perfect. The service was very fast and server Nick was on the top of all our requests. I absolutely love when the servers advise you some dishes and listen to your preferences without pushing their own taste too much. Although the restaurant was supposed to close at the midnight, the guests were not rushed and were welcome to finish their cheesecakes with champaign overlooking the celebrating crowd from the balcony.

My issue is with the service........or lack thereof. The frontline staff sadly had problems knowing where to seat people with no structure or order whatsoever. It was as if we were all playing musical chairs in hopes of finding somewhere to be seated. The service we got from our waitstaff was less than impressive. Sometimes I just wanted to go grab what we needed and we would have been serviced better. For the amount one pays here, how good the food and decor is you would expect the service to match. Not even close. Management is either setting no example, a poor example or is allowing this to pass under their noses. And every time we come here it's the same result: good food but crappy service.....sad.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=80,2.72,2.8,2.78,,2.7680000000000002

3804,Kat V.,"Redding, United States",0,15,4.0,2.0,2018-08-01,"It was an extremely busy night and the wait was 2 hours. They give you a ticket and tell you to report - only to give you a beeper so, they aren't really being honest about how long it takes. We had 2 kids so it was extra long for them.  Finally got seated and the waitress brought drinks. That was messed up - they brought the wrong drink for the youngest (who wanted tea but ended up with water).  While that was happening - I noticed my silverware was dirty (stuck on dried food) so everyone checked theirs and we came up with 3 dirty forks out of 6 and 2 knives. That's when we noticed that the table settings were incomplete and possibly someone had high-graded the settings (no napkins, no spoons, etc). We pointed out to the waitress and she reported it to the manager and brought all new place settings (good job here).  We ordered and after about 20 minutes, a guy walked up (did not introduce himself) to tell us there were no meatballs for my HB's spaghetti and did he want something else (causing more delays). at this time - we again complained about the dirty silverware. This guy seemed unimpressed and brushed us off to hustle away. When the waitress returned, we asked who the other person was and she said he was the Assistant Manager.  All-in-all, the food was good but the problems with the wait, silverware, and running out of food made this a bad experience.  At the end of the meal, we sort of expected some kind of discount on a drink or a meal but - when no concessions were made - my son got very angry and asked to see the manager.  Another long wait and some OTHER guy came over. He must have been the sacrificial lamb as he was NOT the manager or assistant.  He was nice enough but my son told him why we were upset.  We did say that it was not the waitresses fault in general.   SO - my advice is to wander up there for the view and then go somewhere else for food.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-francisco-2?start=140,2.68,2.74,2.772,,2.716

I still had wine in my glass and half a cheesecake on my plate. I said to her ""I'm watching the game"". I hope she wasn't surpised by receiving a tip that reflected her service and attitude.

We asked for the manager and not only did the manager come to our table and declare his position making us feel uncomfortable!  he laid his fingers on the tables and said to us.
