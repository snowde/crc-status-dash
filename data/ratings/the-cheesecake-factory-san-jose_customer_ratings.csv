Wait time was about 20 minutes which wasn't too bad. Our server, Ashley, was nice and prompt.  My issue with this place is the food. For the amount of money you're paying, I would expect something a little better. Hell I would expect my shrimp to at least be deveined! I order the shrimp and bacon club. The sandwhich was HUGE. I took out the middle piece of bread and still had a hard time eating the sandwhich. Mid bite I saw a big, dark, gritty vein looking at me. It was gross. Maybe this is just my thing but everything time I make shrimp I make sure to devein it. And never have I ever eaten at a restaurant where the shrimp wasn't deveined! Bleh.

505,Veronica C.,"San Jose, CA",261,684,68.0,5.0,2012-02-26,"Honestly, I generally have an average experience here. I love that they have so many food choices here, but that also makes it hard for me to decide what to pick. But I don't think I've ever been disappointed by the food here, especially the molasses bread! Service on the other hand has been generally courteous, but a little slow. However, this time around, our waitress went above and beyond. Unfortunately, we didn't tip as much as I had hoped due to some bad math. I had ordered the steak and eggs for lunch and my dish ended up being the last one to come out. To make up for it, our waitress brought me my hashed potatoes first so I could eat while my friends were eating. Eventually, the rest of my meal came, but my steak was not what I was expecting at all! It was some strange, sweet marinade grilled flank. And on top of that, it was cold, but my sunny side up eggs were hot. Not sure what happened to my dish, and I wasn't going to complain about it, but our waitress happened to walk by when I said the meat was cold, and she said she would immediately get it fixed. She let me keep my dish, and about 15 minutes later, brought a small plate of properly cooked and well seasoned steak to me. Now that's what I'm talking about! It was delicious! When we got the bill later, she had taken my plate off! Amazing! I wasn't expecting that since it wasn't her fault, but the chef's, but I really appreciated that. It's really too bad we didn't tip her more, but she singlehandedly restored my faith in the Cheesecake Factory!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=520,3.2,3.37,3.288,3.0920000000000005,3.302

The service was excellent, surprisingly so, on a Saturday night that was super busy. The waitress, who was very friendly and attentive, immediately came to our table with water, bread, coloring stuff, and a little fruit & bread plate for our daughter.

My wife got the Chicken Marsala which is always very good too. I really liked that they had Coke Zero which is hard to find in restaurants.

One day, I will take public transportation all the way from Union City just to savour the delicious morsels of food The Cheesecake Factory has to offer again. Ambiance: It has the decor of a classy restaurant and is the perfect place to take a date! I say that when it comes to the dress code, although you wouldn't get turned away for wearing sweatpants you might want to chuck on your Sunday best. Customer Service: Brilliant! The waiter was polite and courteous plus the food came out at reasonable times. Professional, quality service. Food: Even though The Cheesecake Factory looks like it will burn a hole in your wallet, the prices are actually pretty reasonable and standard - nothing different to say your neighbourhood Applebee's. Plus, the food is so AMAZING that it is worth it! I remember ordering a heavenly Smoked Salmon Bagel and I have never enjoyed a bagel more in my life. My dad dug into his Lamb Chops like it was sweet nectar from the gods themselves.

188,Denise L.,"Santa Clara, CA",971,2329,3797.0,4.0,2012-07-03,"I know it's bad for me, but I love this place. Still one of my favorite restauarnts because there's so many options and so much food!!!  Came here last night to meet some friends, as our tradition has been meeting at a Cheesecake Factory in So Cal or Nor Cal. We were seated in the bar area, ironically because my friend had her baby and a stroller. Which was fine with me since it was before 6, and we could still order from the HH menu! Except only problem was our booth reeked of rotten milk/cheese, and it wasn't the baby! The booth was also a bit of a mess too, lots of crumbs near my seat. We were given sourdough bread, my favorite, no wheat, yay! Which was a bit odd though in case if anyone else wanted wheat. I started with a cosmopolitan, which was only $5 during the happy hour. We also ordered 2 appetizers that were $5, the corn tamales and avocado egg rolls. The cosmo was good and strong, and the appetizers came out right away. There were exactly 3 corn tamale cakes for the 3 of us, and they were huge! They were a bit dense, but really good, filled with corn, topped with sour cream, pico de gallo, and cilantro that I picked off. It was also dipped in a creamy chipotle sauce, so good, but makes you so full! The avocado egg rolls were packed with avocado, too much for me! It's also accompanied with a cilantro sauce, yucky for me! I pretty much always order the farafelle pasta with chicken, even though it's on the list of worst chicken dishes in a restaurant.

I had a fairly large party of 8, so I had to wait 45 minutes for a table. That was to be expected. Then I had to wait 30 minutes for my Godiva martini to come. I expected that too because it was such a busy Friday evening. What I didn't expect was the manager coming out and apologizing to me and my friends and comping our drinks on the house!

When we came back, they still didnt have a table for us, but we were able to snag a half cleaned bar table to sit on.

We said no and let the ladies order and perfect timing! bc the hostess called our name. we got seated in the patio outside next to the heater. We got chicken and biscuits and a strawberry creamsicle for later. Boyfriend had the chicken and biscuits before and told me it was HUGE and a whopping 2000 calorie dish! better share that. and boy he was right. it came fresh and hot. Chicken was very tender and the biscuits were soft and warn, vegetables were tasty, and the gravy was creamy and delicious. We shared it, and we STILL had leftovers!

Our server and her helpers were always there, never with an empty drink and always returning promptly with any condiment request and was always within earshot if we needed something. At many restaurants, they split a server's section to a couple tables here and a couple tables there. Here, she had two tables adjacent to our table and 3 tables across the way so she was never very far away. So why not 5 stars?  Some things could be changed, some things obviously not. 1. We were celebrating a birthday. There were 5 or so servers singing happy birthday. It was super lame. They all could care less so much that I couldn't even sing along. 2.

Well, I went here for a surprise birthday dinner for my friend, who was currently derping around in the mall until our table was ready. We came in and they said 30 minute wait for 8 people. Keep in mind that this was at 5pm, so it wasn't crowded yet. There was clearly a plethora of seats available. Mmm, okay, we thought. 30 minute wait for 8 people? Not bad!!! So we waited. And finally, 45 minutes later, they tell us that our table is getting ready. Awesome! 45 minutes is still not bad. So we waited some more. A total of one hour passes by, and the people at the front tell us that it will be soon. Uh, okay.  Parties of 6 and 7 people got their table before us.  15 minutes later, we approach them and ask for our table. THEN we get our table.

620,Toni C.,"Benicia, CA",96,56,4.0,4.0,2012-12-17,"I don't know why I like the Cheesecake Factory so much.  Maybe it's because even though it's a chain restaurant it's on the upscale side?  I don't know.  I just know I like coming here and I like the looks of the place. My Hub and I were served by the lovely and gracious Vera H.  I wasn't in a very pleasant mood when we arrived (it was on the warm side and the air conditioner in the car wasn't working right.  :(  but sweet Vera was very patient and I'd say even kind to me.  ;)  The Hub ordered an iced tea and I ordered a Long Island Iced Tea.  Things started looking better after the LIIT.  ;)  We both ordered a bowl of clam chowder (as we are continually on a quest for the definitive clam chowder) and the Crab and Artichoke Dip appetizer.  Although the clam chowder was very good and full of clams, celery, potatoes and all the other goodies, I wouldn't say it was the definitive clam chowder.  Still, it was good and I would order it again.  But oh!  Was the dip ever yummy!  The only thing I didn't like about it was that it was served on crunchy baked and seasoned french bread strips; the dip had a very delicate flavor of it's own, and it had to ""fight"" with the flavor and crunchiness of the french bread.  I used the softer bread that was served in the basket  and found that it tasted so much better.  You could actually taste the flavor of the crab!  Huzzah!  We should've stopped there, but no.  We ordered (and shared) a Steak Diane and Chicken Madeira Combination plate.  I think I have finally found my favorite dish at the Cheesecake Factory.  The beef was covered in mushrooms and cooked to medium rare and was so tender and delicious.  The chicken was covered in mushrooms and cheese and served with a delicious sauce.  The dish is served with mashed potatoes. If that wasn't enough, we got a slice of ""Original"" (New York Style) cheesecake to go.  No way did we have the room to eat it there. This was above and by far the best eating experience we've had at the Cheesecake Factory.  We've always enjoyed our food when we've eaten there, but last night's meal topped them all. 9/22/2012 / First posted 12-17-2012",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=660,3.84,3.53,3.352,3.12,3.654

Six of us ladies celebrating a late mothers day, and three birthdays for my godmother, counsin and aunt. With six of us we were there to spend money. We arrived around 430 so we knew the wait wouldn't be long. We were seated right away( After we barely found parking in their crazy parking lot). Our waitress seemed like she was having a stressed day. I've been here many times and the service here is a hit or miss.   My grandmother tends to ask a lot of menu questions but that is what we pay for, the service. The entire time our waitress helped us she seemed impatient and never really asked anything else? Before she left the table. If I asked for  a water she just walked away. With five other ladies sitting at the table you'd think she would want less trips? I had ordered a burger with fries and wanted some honey mustard. She came back and said they were out. What a strange thing to be out of. I could see if ketchup was since its used more but honey mustard? Oh well. When my godmother got her meatloaf half of it was burnt. It was brought to her attention but instead of offering a new one she said i'll let the kitchen manager know. When it came time for dessert we all ordered one. There's $45-50 bucks right there, just in desserts!  She came back to say they were out of strawberry cheesecake. My grandmother was no impressed. We all had our desserts and the most popular one they are out of? She quickly made a new choice and got it within a good amount of time.  When we got our bill it was not split the way we asked from the beginning.  I was beginning to write it out when she came by to say sorry I'll fix that for you. We wanted to enjoy our desserts and open presents but our table was full of dirty dishes. We called the manager over to voice our bad experience overall. He seemed to listen but didn't seem like he really cared. We asked if he could send someone to clean our dinner plates so we can enjoy our dessert with a clean table and he said no problem. 15 min later and no one still came. We opened the gifts with dirty plates. As we left my godmother spoke to him that no one came to help clear the table. He said he sent someone and apologized. As we were walking out he came out to say he wanted to know if someone did come but we asked the person to leave the table. We told him that was not true, It seemed a lot of people were lying this day. Perhaps laziness from the staff and it was all being put on the manger. I don't know if ill go to this location again.  And to top it off my godmother got gum on her pants from the booth!

Eating out is more than the food, though.  Service is key.  Today the Cheesecake Factory blew it big time with their service.  Everything started out ok.  We had to wait 35 min for a table, but with a group of 7 on a Sunday night that wasn't unheard of.  Once we were seated our waiter came right over and took our drink order (and we ordered the crab wantons at that time too).  We got our drinks and our waiter told us that our bread was cooking as well as our wantons.  And then he was gone.   Eventually he came back with our wantons and took our dinner orders (still no bread).  Drinks were never refilled.  We did not see our waiter again until after some of our dinner arrived.  Our meals did not come out together.  Both kids meals and 2 of the adult meals came at first.  Then 2 more arrived, but one entree was delivered with chicken, when it was ordered without chicken (chicken had to be added to this entree for an extra charge).  It was taken away to be fixed.  My brother's entree did not arrive, but our waiter told us it was on its way. Well, the kids and one of the adults finished their meals before my husband found the manager and told him that most of us were finished with our meals and 2 of our meals were still missing and that we had never received our bread.  Then the manager disappeared.  The waiter returned with the fixed entree, but still no entree for my brother.  My brother then told the waiter that he is diabetic and had already taken his insulin in anticipation of dinner so he needed to have food pretty much now or he was going to pass out and cause a medical emergency.  Again the waiter disappeared. This time he reappeared with our bread.  Which my brother used as a band-aid to counteract the insulin.  The waiter told us the manager was waiting on the line and that as soon as the entree was ready it would be delivered.  By this time everyone else was finished eating. Eventually my brother did get his food, and the manager removed it from our bill.  My husband pointed out that one other entree was made incorrectly and it took an inordinate amount of time to be fixed and that entree was also removed from our bill.  My daughter and I each received a complementary dessert for our birthdays.

Which was exactly why I was there the other night.  The wait was relatively long. When we arrived, the estimated time for seating was about 40 minutes so we stood around the lobby area trying to decide beforehand what cheesecake we'd want to try. Once we sat down at the table, our server came to take our order and to let us know that it was very hectic in the bakery so our cheesecakes would take longer than usual to get to us. We decided to order two appetizers to start: the parmesan polenta fries and warm crab and artichoke dip. Both were delicious.  The parmesan polenta fries appear at first to look like mozzarella sticks with marinara sauce. The outside is a golden brown crispy breading. The inside is soft, a contrast to the crunchy breading. I really thought this was a very good appetizer. Not too filling, which is perfect as a starter. The warm crab and artichoke dip was very delicious. It came with a side of toasted bread. The dip was warm and creamy and you can taste the chunks of crab and artichoke. I would definitely order this again. We wanted to save room for our cheesecake so we didn't order any entrees this time. I ordered a slice of Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake, which has chocolate cake, brownie, and toasted coconut pecan frosting. I love chocolate so the chocolate cake and the chewy brownie was perfect for me. And I do like coconut too, but tonight, I felt that the coconut was too overpowering in taste that it overwhelmed everything else in the cake. I felt that the coconut stood out a lot more than any other part of the cake. So if you really like a strong coconut flavor, this is the cake to order. I also had a bite of the Snicker's cheesecake and if you're a fan of Snicker's bar, this is the perfect dessert to get. I had a taste of Craig's Carrot Cake Cheesecake and I loved it. Half carrot cake, half cheesecake mixed together, what isn't there to love? And I also had a bite of the vanilla bean. It tasted exactly like how vanilla bean ice cream tastes like. It's plain compared to most of their other cheesecake but still delicious. Service was a little slow the night we went. But considering that many people probably went for the half off cheesecake, I can understand why. The restaurant was packed and while I was waiting in the lobby to be seated, I could see the people working in the bakery section running around trying to fulfill all the orders. Loved the food we ordered. I'll be returning again soon. And I'll for sure return next year for National Cheesecake day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=340,3.44,3.58,3.46,3.408,3.5240000000000005

The waiter was very friendly and gave us anything we wanted. They brought out our food probably within 10 or 15 minutes. I would say that The Cheesecake Factory had excellent service. Food: The food was absolutely delicious. I ordered a chicken dish. It had an Asian sauce that went very well with the chicken. There was a caramel sauce that was drizzled on top of the chicken that made it have an amazing flavor. The caramel on the outside made it sweet and crunchy. There was rice served with the chicken that also went well with the chicken. If you go here you should give this dish a try. Dessert: The cheesecake that they serve there is the best. I ordered the red velvet cheesecake and it is to die for. The cake was very moist. The cream cheese in the middle was sweet and creamy. The white chocolates at the top gave it a special taste. Whenever I go here I'm always excited for the dessert.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=440,3.36,3.59,3.46,3.54,3.498

728,Judy C.,"San Jose, CA",245,65,,3.0,2013-08-22,"For a chain, I think Cheesecake Factory is a good place to have a nice catch up with friends or a relaxed date. The mood is casual, not too loud where you have to scream across the table to speak to somebody, and the food is good and shareable. I also like how they have small bites because I like variety and I can never finish my own entree. Pricing is very reasonable and cheesecake can get overwhelming, so, like many people, I encourage you to share a slice. What I've tried so far: -Avacado Egg Rolls:  If you love avocados, you'll love their avocado egg rolls. You'll get a heaping amount of avocado in your mouth with the first bite!  -Caesar Salad: Can't really go wrong with a salad. Good part about it was that they didn't drench it in dressing. -Mushroom Soup: Tasty but started to taste a little salty at the end. A cup is actually in a bowl so it's good to share if you have an entree coming out. I can only imagine how big the bowl portion is... -Miso Salmon: Sweet honey glaze, flavorful, and delicious! I opted for brown rice. -Salisbury Steak: Too Salty, SKIP! I was craving sauteed mushrooms and caramelized onions that day and didn't want to get a burger (laying low on the carbs). It sounded good but it wasn't. Bleh! Took it home and made a loco moco out of it. -Lemon Chicken: YUM!

Its not nearly as packed and rowdy as the one in Honolulu or in San Diego, but still fills up later in the evening.   Service: I went for my birthday, knowing that they didn't take reservations, and had to wait to find out how long the wait would be for a party of 9. With this in mind, the manager was very speedy to get me a table, took about a 30 min wait overall which wasn't bad. The waiter was very amiable and pretty patient knowing that my party was trickling in (very slowly due to parking at the mall) and kept a pretty watchful eye on my drinks.  Food: What can I say, Cheesecake Factory always delivers on this. It took a while for the food to come out, and it was a little disappointing considering it wasn't fully packed. other than that though, I got my bday wish + a corny song when my pumpkin pecan cheesecake came out. It was great. Price: Be prepared to spend some bills if you are going to have a dinner with a few people. For myself plus my wife and daughter with one appetizer and 3 meals plus desserts came to a little over $100. It's worth the price, but not for regular weekends out.

821,Janine M.,"San Jose, CA",2,21,,2.0,2013-11-17,I love cheesecake factory just love it but this location has gone down hill in my opinion.  The bathroom was disgusting!!!  No toilet paper at all!! There was tissue all over the floor & garbage pouring out of the trash bin.  It looked like no one had cleaned it in some time.  Just gross!!  Cheesecake was fabulous as always.  My food was terriable... I ordered a french dip type of sandwich and it had horseradish on it which is normally served on the side I requested another sandwich as I cannot eat horseradish.  They brought me another one but the 2nd one they brought looked gross.  The meat was all bloody and full of fat.  I'm just really disapointed.  I wasn't even asked if I would like something else to replace my sandwich. I think I'd rather go to the restaurant at Valley Fair from now on.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=820,3.48,3.52,3.464,2.9200000000000004,3.5040000000000004
765,ID X.,"Anchorage, AK",2,59,4.0,2.0,2013-11-20,"This review is for the MANAGER. I don't know if they read their reviews but I strongly suggest they do. I've been ordering to-go recently and experience major problems. Of what you may ask? Someone picks up and puts you on hold for 15 minutes for a to-go order? I could've been in there receiving my food already. It's really unfair and I've spoken with the workers as well. They claim that there's only one person working at the bakery/togo section. If you're a damn manager you should clearly know that's unacceptable for a restaurant like cheesecake. Not saying it's a 5 star restaurant or anything but most dishes ranges at around 15-20 dollars. So I should be provided decent service whether I am dining inside or outside. Hire more people , I'm sure you can afford it. I doubt the manager reads this review since they can't even do a simple task such as HIRING enough employees.

174,Beth W.,"Los Gatos, CA",1014,262,3011.0,4.0,2013-12-06,"Today I had lunch with four generations ~ my mom, daughter, grandson Ian and myself.  As usual, we arrived just in time when they open at 11:30AM.  Parking at Oakridge Mall can be hard to get past 12PM and so can getting a table at The Cheesecake Factory during the lunch hour as well. Our server today was Shannon, who happened to give us the very best A+ service ever!  He anticipated our needs without our ever asking for a refill, when our appetizer was coming, etc. ~ now that's platinum level service.  Scotty is another one whom we had excellent service from as well so make sure you ask to be seated in either one of  these men's stations when you dine here. I decided to try something different and I'm glad I did.  I ordered the Americana Burger, well done and with the clam chowder (it's Friday) instead of the fries or green salad options.  This particular cheeseburger was very juicy, not greasy, for a well done burger.  I could only eat half as it was so large!  I did eat most of the soup. My mother had the Chicken Madeira which came with mashed potatoes.  She said her chicken was full of flavor as was the creamy mashed potatoes.  Noelle J., my daughter, ordered her fave The Factory Burger.  It was ordered well done also.  She noticed that my burger was much larger than hers and a dollar less in price. For dessert, we ordered two cheesecakes: Pumpkin Pecan and the S'mores one.  The Pumpkin Pecan has a pecan pie bottom layer with pumpkin cheesecake on top.  It was very good with both my mother and I enjoying it.  Noelle, being allergic to nuts, could only imagine how good that was.  I introduced Noelle to the S'mores cheesecake earlier in the fall season and she liked it so much, it's her go-to while it's still available.  Currently, the Peppermint Bark cheesecake is the new cheesecake starting this month, as the seasonal offering. As I said earlier, Shannon anticipated our dining needs well.  We had a great time during our lunch as we usually do with the added ""cherry on the top"" of great service by Shannon.  Before we left, we complimented Shannon on his service to us and asked to speak to his manager.  She came by and we related how much we enjoyed the excellent service and if he's not on the training team, he should be!  As it turns out, Shannon is part of the training team for this location. Yes, parking is still horrible here if you don't come early but we avoid that by coming when they first open!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=280,3.4,3.5,3.464,3.152,3.4600000000000004
386,Sher F.,"San Jose, CA",4,34,,5.0,2013-12-10,My daughter was turning 10 and wanted to have her party here at Cheesecake Factory with 7 of her friends. The party was on a Sunday at 11:30am.   They didn't take reservations but told me that it was okay to come early the day of the party to decorate and they would find me a spot.  The day of the party I spoke with James the manager and he was very helpful and reserved a spot for me in the back.  I was able to decorate the tables and put up some balloons.    Our server was Vera and she was absolutely wonderful.   Very patient with the little girls at the table who were all very excited to be there.  The food came out pretty quickly and Vera was very attentive in coming back to check with us periodically on if we needed anything.   I love their Fried Zucchini and the Spinach Artichoke Dip with the toasted bread with butter was delicious.  I did get some cheesecake to go and tried the new Peppermint Cheesecake and thought it was great as well.  Afterwards we headed to the movie theatre which just takes few minutes to walk to since it is located in the same mall so it was a very convenient location.  The only challenge of the day was that it is holiday season and finding parking was difficult.  But that was not Cheese Cake Factory's fault.    All in all the staff at the Cheesecake Factory contributed to the success of the party and we were all pleased with the service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=400,3.44,3.51,3.472,3.188,3.482

The wait was 45 min like the hostess said. Perfect. We were seated immediately, but it took a while for the server to come by our table. Now, I'm not saying that our server is a bad server, but his service wasnt very good in my experience. Literally visited our table twice- take order and give food. I may look younger, but that doesn't mean your service should be any lower for any customer! We sat down around 8pm ish so it wasnt even that busy anymore. So I expected better service...  I think the menu is too much. Too many options and too much to look at. But, for the most part their food was pretty good.  Miso salmon- $20 , salmon and sauce was so good. Rice- way too dry and grainy. Like, c'mon I'm asian I know good rice....  Mushroom burger-$12,  good sized patty but too much cheese... Kind of overpowered the taste.

132,Cindy C.,"San Mateo, CA",410,450,3439.0,3.0,2014-01-19,"My first attempt at this place was quite frustrating. I know happy hours are usually Mon-Fri but that is exactly why I called Saturday morning to make sure. A girl answered the phone and told me yes, they did have happy hour. My friend and I made the drive there and was told that in fact they do NOT have happy hour. I know it wasn't the hostess' fault because I don't know who I spoke with, but I let her know exactly how upset I was at being misinformed. The staff needs to get their information straight before answering customers' questions. My second attempt at coming for happy hour was much better. I called ahead again to make sure and was told it was Mon-Fri 4-6. It was a Friday evening and we came right at happy hour. You have the choice of either sitting at the bar, the tall tables, or a booth. My friend and I preferred the booth because it was a little bit cozier.  The menu was already on the table for us when we were seated. $5 drinks and appetizers during their happy hour which is a great deal. They had a few drink selections such as margarita, j.w.'s pink lemonade, mojito, and long island ice tea. I asked the waiter which drink was sweetest and he suggested the pink lemonade which I absolutely loved! My friend got the margarita, blended, and it was good but a bit salty for my taste. Their choices for appetizers are great. I ordered the road side sliders and the avocado eggrolls. I've had them before so I knew they were going to be great. The bun on the sliders were so soft and warm when they were brought out. The dipping sauce for the avocado eggrolls were definitely the highlight of the dish. For dessert I got my usual, the ultimate red velvet cheesecake! Who doesn't love cheesecake and red velvet?! It's heaven on a plate! Be warned that it is a rich piece of cake that you might want to share or it can be overwhelmingly sweet. Unfortunately I didn't catch the name of our waiter but he was fantastic! Took our order promptly, checked on us multiple times, brought us complimentary bread and butter, even made sure I liked my drink and was ready to bring me a second.

509,Amy T.,"San Jose, CA",360,63,31.0,3.0,2014-01-22,"My sister, my cousin, and I decided to come eat here Tuesday night for our monthly catch-up dinner. We were seated immediately. Our server, Junno, was super sweet and patient with us -especially since we had very complicated orders.  My cousin and I were probably most excited for our side orders of mashed potatoes with wasabi butter but 5 minutes after we ordered it, our server came back to tell us they had run out of wasabi butter. That was the first disappointment of the night. My sister ordered a steak and asked for it to be cooked medium rare. As she began eating it, she then realized it was cooked super well done. So we flagged down our server and he was very apologetic, and immediately brought her plate back to the kitchen to be re-cooked. The manager then approached our table shortly after and was extremely apologetic and sweet. He even told us to save room because he wanted to give us a dessert on the house. The service alone from this point deserved 5 stars on its own because not only were they genuinely apologetic for the minor mistakes, but they even remade my sisters steak, and the manager offered a dessert on the house. We then ordered a red velvet cheesecake in the end and just like déjà vu, the server came back 5 minutes later to tell us that the red velvet flavor was all gone. So we decided on a different flavor. However, the bill then came out and we were charged for the dessert! I'm sure it was  a genuine, honest mistake, but still... It was the fact that the manager had already told us we would receive a dessert on the house. By this point though, it was already 15 minutes until closing, and we're not cheap people so we weren't going to interrupt the busy manager just to comp our dessert.. Overall, the server was great; he did his job very well and it obviously wasn't his fault that certain foods were all gone. On the other hand, no wasabi butter, no red velvet cheesecake, and forgetting to comp our dessert when they promised us it would be, are good enough reasons to take away 2 stars. But I feel like we just came here on a bad night.

I recently just went on 2/8/2014 and had to wait an hour. -__________- Granted it was a Saturday evening, but still are they understaffed or something? They always seem to be moving so slow! As for the food, my favorite dish by far is the Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich with chipotle mayo. The meat is so moist and tender and overall yummy! Never get their side salad though. It's so gross and bitter...then again I'm the type of person who likes the plain old Caesar Salad. To each their own. You might enjoy it. Aside from this entrée, their burger is eh--nothing spectacular. I'd rather go to Red Robin or BJs next door if I wanted a good burger. I enjoy the low lighting and atmosphere of this place, but it does tend to get really loud. It's conveniently placed in a mall where we can roam around before or after our meal.  More often then not, I come here for the cheesecake. Granted it's not the best and smoothest cheesecake I've ever had--it's still pretty good. I especially adore their Red Velvet. But I know people who enjoy their Reese's Peanut Butter Cheesecake and their Mud Pie.  Another complaint I have though is that their Orange Chicken seems to be hit or miss every time we order it. The very last time we received it, it was nice and moist and covered with sauce. But a couple times before that, they came out pretty dry. AND it's a $17 dish which I think is kind of ridiculous considering all they give you is about ten pieces of chicken and a portion of white rice.  PLUS SIDE. Their Oreo Milkshake is sooooo good.

507,Kristine F.,"Hayward, CA",448,567,3762.0,5.0,2014-03-08,"Upon reaching the front from the mall entrance, I was promptly greeted by three smiling hostesses and seated with no wait whatsoever at 6pm on a Thursday night. Our waiter Dustin D was detail oriented and refilled our water at least four times! This was my first visit at the Oakridge location and I was not disappointed. Prior to my dinner, I had yelped regarding customer service and learned about fantastic waiters being on the restaurant's training team. I am completely convinced Dustin is on it. He waited patiently while we decided on appetizers (one of my friends is a vegetarian), so patiently that I had to ask him for a bit more time. We were ready to order when he arrived with our drinks (four waters, one no ice) and he clearly stated the Caesar dressing has anchovies in it, in case we had issues with that. After my friend ordered her veggie burger, he questioned if I was ok with how the Chicken Bellagio was prepared (pan fried chicken, prosciutto, etc.). The calamari was brought out immediately after, crisp and tasty, but who can go wrong with fried calamari? I did expect a garlic aioli but it seems they exchanged that with a mere cream dip. After the Caesar salad arrived, Dustin checked back to see how the appetizers were. We hadn't touched the salad yet, so I said we were still working on it. He said he wanted to make sure everything was ok. I also asked for fresh Parmesan when my meal arrived, which was brought over immediately. Our waters were never empty for longer than five minutes.

Being a New Yorker I HAD to try the cheesecake, and if your name is ""cheesecake factory"" You better make some damn good Cheesecake...They don't.  If you had GOOD cheesecake in NYC(or dare I say...Chitcago..oops, Chicago..*gags*) Then you will know that it doesn't come out cold, doesn't come out warm. The cheesecake here came out a bit too warm(almost room temperature). It also didn't have the firmness that the good stuff has, and doesn't melt in your mouth like it should. The graham cracker crust is so thin, it's almost non existent, not thick like it should be to hold all the yummy goodness that is sweetened cream cheese.  So you get one star for making my homesickness relieve it's self a bit. The chicken stuffed tortilla...Eh, can't taste the chicken, but you can taste everything else...Had enough flavor, but doesn't hit the spot..Then again I ordered Mexican food at a suburban white persons establishment , you can find better from a taco stand. Will I ever step foot in a cheesecake factory again? Hell no, price doesn't justify it.

I wish they made a cheesecake without eggs. Had a short 5 min wait to be seated at a booth. Decided to order fried zucchini and portobello mushroom fries and asked for ketchup vs the dips. Tasted really good! There whole wheat bread and butter also was delectable, I did not like the white bread at all.  I went through the menu and decided on a large veggie burger and fries, boy was the burger big and it tasted really good. My wife went with a pasta dish and she liked it.

We waited about 10 minutes and were seated in the bar area. Our server plopped us down with no pleasantries and gave us our menus. When she came back to get our drink orders we didn't even have water or bread. We had to ask for water and then proceeded to order when she finally came back the next time.  Our order consisted of one diet coke, edamame and fire roasted chile rellenos. The chile rellenos came first and it was pretty good. The edamame proceeded and was plopped down by our server.  As the plopping occurred she said, 'soy sauce.' We said, 'huh?' Again, she said, 'soy sauce' and we said, 'huh.' After the second 'soy sauce' we realized she was asking if we wanted some with our edamame. She wasn't very pleasant and seemed to be having a bad day. Would it have killed her to say, 'Would you like some soy sauce?' At least we would've been able to understand her.... nonetheless we said yes.  Fast forward 10 minutes and the edamame was almost gone and we still didn't have any soy sauce. We kept seeing her walk by but couldn't get her attention even if our life depended on it. Eventually we wrangled her to our table and got our soy sauce.  Once we were done eating I wanted to order cheesecake, but was dreading having to track her down for a menu. We got another server to bring us the menu and then we got yet another server to take our order. In all that time, our server NEVER came to our table to see how our meal was or to ask if we wanted dessert! Overall, terrible customer service.

Our server seemed to fit right in with my friends and I as we randomly chose cheesecake factory as our restaurant to have dinner. We originally were about to go to boston market to have a healthy meal, but I am most certainly glad we did not. We were seated promptly by our hostess and immediately met Amy who we found out would be our server for the night. She gave us excellent recommendations as my friends and I were struggling to figure out what we wanted to eat. One of my friends was torn between 2 dishes. One of which she told us was not in the menu and claimed to be even better than his favorite miso salmon. Somehow we ended up convincing him to just get both. I had a hard time deciding on which salad I wanted and she went through the salads and seemed particularly enthusiastic about one of them and I was sold. Ended up ordering a pretty big meal for 3 people but she made everything sound so good we figured we'd just pack up the leftovers for later. Food came out and just to show how personable she is, she stuck with us till my friend ate the new thai salmon dish and let her know if what she claimed was true. Unfortunately we still feel like the miso salmon is better but the thai was still very good. we all laughed and had a good time. We had the fried mac n cheese which always a yummy appetizer. eating my salad made me realize why  she was so enthusiastic about it. it was hella bomb. the marinated steak salad. the steak was done just right. I wanted medium rare but she said that the steak in the salads always came the same way and they're just right so i trusted her and voila. amazing salad. my other friend ordered the grilled pork chop and he said it was mouth watering as every bite kind of just melted in his mouth. and yea, the pork was that soft. all in all a very satisfying meal. OH! almost forgot about our midway meal appetizer. We all kind of wanted to order another ""semi-healthy"" appetizer so we asked amy to accommodate us by randomly picking one for us she thought we'd like. she came back a minute later with a small list. and again. as she listed them, she got particularly excited about the stuffed mushrooms, so we all went ooooooo...and she then informed us that they were hella good and she loved them. sold once again. well that is pretty much it. an eating experience that never had a dull moment all thanks to a server that either loves her job or is really good at pretending she does. she was able to make us all feel comfortable and welcomed. so much so that we felt like we were dining at home.

So because of this, I feel obligated to finally write a heart felt honest review.  Alright the menu here is most definitely intimidating. It is literally top to bottom, page after page lists of different appetizers, small plates, salads, and entrees. No joke, I probably have tried everything on the menu and that itself says a lot haha. I recommend the asian chicken salad. It's enough to feed a small village and it's definitely tasty. Or, if you like pasta I really enjoy the garlic noodles here because it's made like a pasta. COMPLETELY different from garlic noodles from yard house and straits which I personally despise. However the crown jewel of this huge restaurant chain is the pick and pair double entree. You can choose  two out of the shrimp scampi, steak Diane, miso salmon and the Parmesan chicken. My favs are the steak Diane paired with the chicken. It's definitely the biggest bang for your buck. I always save 2/3 of the plate for lunch and dinner the day after. Service at this location isn't always the best because they're swamped most of the time.

I ordered curbside delivery 9/26/14 but even after asking for the gentleman who took my order to give my order back to me which was easy (two grilled cheese sandwiches and one order of spicy cashew chicken and 4 slices of cheesecake.) Obviously this was more of a order for the little ones in my home sitting hungry. The guy who took my order said it would take 30-40mins to be ready. My reply ""no rush I'm not close take your time"" his reply ""thank you ma'am."" After 45 mins go by my husband leaves to go get food, comes home then notices the one none kid order was wrong (no spicy cashew chicken) yay, NOT! So now we have to go back out to tell them they screwed up.  My husband arrived went to the checkout line waiting 10mins then walked to the maître d'and asked what to do since we have a meal we didn't order and it's now 2 hours in since ordered (even though I called ahead.) They pointed to the line my husband just exited to ask for help.....but now must re-enter and wait yet another 15 mins to get our original meal order.  Did they say sorry? Did they offer a discount? Anything? NOPE! Instead an evening of my family running back and forth at this restaurant. Complete waste of the night. Yes we got our chicken dish, but at the cost of time and gas it took it was a total waste.  Completely disappointed in the lack of any customer service.

Plus, there's the cheesecake! *Mumm napa, brut prestige, napa valley, sparkling wine ($13 split) *Mini crabcakes ($13.50): served with mustard and tartar sauce *Avocado eggrolls ($10.95): avocado, tomato, red onion & cilantro fried in a crisp wrapper, with a tamarind-cashew dipping sauce *Cajun jambalaya ($17.95): shrimp & chicken sauteed with onions, tomato and peppers in a spicy cajun sauce, over rice *Spicy chipotle chicken sandwich ($11.95): crispy coated chicken breast w/melted cheese & spicy buffalo on a brioche bun w/fries *Shrimp scampi & steak diane ($19.95): shrimp w/garlic, wine, basil, tomato; steak w/peppercorns, mushroom wine sauce; Salad *Kahlua cocoa coffee cheesecake: layers of rich brownie, kahlua cheesecake, creamy chocolate mousse and chocolate ganache *Peppermint bark cheesecake: white chocolate cheesecake w/chocolate peppermint bark, white chocolate mousse & chopped peppermint I went with the roommate's siblings, so there were 5 of us. Since he's been here so many times, he tends to order the same thing every time: avocado egg rolls, jambalaya and kahlua coffee cheesecake. All were good choices and he seemed to enjoy them. I however, can get overwhelmed by the huge menu and have no idea what to order. I ended up getting the mini crabcakes and the combination plate of shrimp scampi and steak diane. The crab cakes were good. The cakes could have been a little crisper from the sear since they were a little mushy. But it had a good amount of crab. The steak and shrimp were okay. The steak is served in three individual pieces, so if you like your meat rare, it will be over cooked. The shrimp were a good size and came in three as well. The sauce was a little too lemony for my tastes though. I did like the mixed green salad with their balsamic though. For me, the main reason to come here is the cheesecake. I ended up getting the peppermint cheesecake since it was seasonal and I do love peppermint! It was wasn't as heavy as I thought it would be which was good. And I loved the addition of the candy cane pieces on the whipped cream. I didn't care too much for the crust since it was too dense, but overall I enjoyed the slice. One of the drawbacks to Cheesecake Factory is they don't take reservations, so there's normally always a wait. I think we waited about 20-30 mins last Sunday around lunchtime. Not too bad compared to other locations I've been to. For a dining option at Oakridge, the Cheesecake Factory is one of the better ones.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=120,3.44,3.25,3.428,2.668,3.326

Food: - I am a macaroni and cheese lover, and I was not pleased with their mac and cheese. I don't know how to explain it- but the taste and texture was off. You're better off getting the packaged mac and cheese at Safeway. -Sweet Potato Fries- After trying sweet potato fries from The Counter and the Palo Alto Creamery, CF's fries pale in comparison. They are definitely not crispy, and crispiness is crucial in determining if the fries are good or not. -Chicken Alfredo- Honestly, I prefer the Chicken Alfredo from Costco ( the one that's premade for you). With that being said, CF's Chicken alfredo is okay- nothing to rave about.  -Cheesecake- Now, I will say that their cheesecake is really good, but too bad it's pretty expensive. Service: This place is always packed, and I get that it will take some time to get seated. But, I find it ridiculous that people who came in after me were seated before me!

When they brought out the grilled onions they were COLD AND SLIMY. Overall I've had better customer service at a McDonald's and better food as well.

Beautiful setup.  But so many people available to run around asking people how food was, but not enough people in the kitchen.  I see many people seem to like this place, I will have to say that I got unlucky.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=480,3.04,3.15,3.336,2.732,3.106

Went to the restroom and saw a waitress go straight from a stall to tie her apron skipping the sink.... eew. Went back to the entry area and found a small section on the bench area to sit my pregnant self down. Waited about 20 or so minutes. Got to the table next to the kitchen. Sound of dishes clattering made me cringe. Waitress shows up. Polite and friendly. Takes drink orders, though forgets the lemon and the cider isn't so cold. Easy to flag down though.  Mini corndogs arrive and are pretty good. Food arrives with a hair in it. No way it's mine or my waitresses, and she gets me a fresh plate.

Not being super hungry for their super portions, we opted for tapas on their light menu.  Granted their ""light menu"" has tapas below 500 cal.  When we opt for 4 appetizers to share, that is not exactly light.  We ordered the ahi carpaccio, lettuce wraps, spring rolls, and crab puffs. There were two ahi dishes on the menu, one was double the price of the other.  When I asked the waiter the difference between the two, he had said the amount of ahi varies.  Boy was he being honest.  The cheaper of the two had about 2 spoonfulls of ahi!  They should call it avocado carpaccio with ahi garnish.  I felt bamboozled. The lettuce wraps weren't much better.  More than half of the plate was filled with what I call ""cheap filler food.""  For these wraps that means crispy rice noodles.  Once again, most would consider that garnish or decoration, but it was necessary to add any substance to the lettuce wraps. The spring rolls contained almost all filler food.  Instead of focusing on the shrimp, it had noodles in it... noodles in a wrapper. Not even quality veggies.... just carbs carbs carbs. I think the crab puffs, although my least favorite of all the dishes, had the most substance to it.  Bread crumbs, cream cheese and Krab rolled and deep fried.  Who knows, maybe cheesecake factory was always like that, but no wonder their calorie count is super high.

Quesadilla Appetizer: The quesadilla was really good! Compared to your typical quesadilla, there is guac, salsa, sour cream, and peppers included, which all made it great! I only wish there were more to devour. Red Velvet Cheesecake: This cheesecake was the star of the night. We LOVED it! The portions of cheesecake to red velvet cake was just right and it was absolutely sweet! I liked it but she thought it was slightly too sweet.

This can be shared (for Asians like us, one can't finish the burger alone) I can say, after being here in Bay Area for just half a year only and had tried burgers all over, this is one of the best burgers I had. The burger, the bun, the cheese, the veggies and the secret sauce, love it! We managed to eat half only. I love to bake and red velvet cake is one of my forte. I ordered ultimate red velvet cheesecake and this is sooo good! Highly recommended!  We were served by John and he was really friendly. As usual we were not able to finish our food, we had to go boxes and John packed for us. We had a great meal. We are definitely coming back.

It took quite a while to order.  Ordered prawn dinner (came out burnt however they served if to us anyway?!?), hibachi steak dinner (came out okay), steak Diane med-rare with a pepper sauce (came well done and super chewy, served it to us anyway), the kids ordered kid dishes and we're happy.  Told the waiter we weren't happy and she said she'd have to check with her boss to see if if was okay to redo them (REALLY?!?).  By the time our food was brought back we were tired and asked that they package it to go.  Everyone else was finished eating and wanted to leave.  Called the next day and spoke to Jason the manager.  Jason assured me he'd take care of us no problem with a gift certificate.  However when I went in to get the gift certificate Jason said they don't do that?!?  What are you talking about Jason...you screwed up.  He offered me a dessert for the horrible steak dinner and prawn dinner....  You took my money and even forgot to return our credit card.  I'm sorry Jason but you've lost my business.

142,Alec M.,"Tracy, CA",17,153,32.0,1.0,2015-12-14,"The most disappointing Cheesecake Factory experience we've had, and we've been going to them for more than fifteen years. My sister and I decided to eat at The Cheesecake Factory after a work meeting. From the moment we walked in, something was wrong. The woman who greeted us at the counter... well, she didn't greet us at all. She simply said ""how many"" without even looking at us, and didn't say a word nor smile at us as she led us to our table. No wait, but it was a weekday in the mid-afternoon, so that was expected. We got to our table, and we started playing the waiting game. Despite there being very few tables filled, it took ten minutes for our server to even come up to us. Waiting became the theme of our meal. Waiting to get acknowledged, waiting to get water... we never got refills, by the way. While our server was nice enough, it became obvious she was more interested in talking with her server friends instead of dealing with us. We'd look up during the meal and see her chatting with other servers at the register, even though we were waiting for water, waiting for our food to get boxed up, waiting for our check... it was infuriating. Not to mention I had wasted a $10 shopkick gift card on the meal. For those familiar with the program, you know how tough it is to get to the $10 mark. The upside: my food (pasta carbonara) was delicious as always, and our appetizer was great as well. My sister's eggplant parmesan was over-salted and was sent back, and her new entree of orange chicken was a new preparation that she didn't care for.  I sent an email to Cheesecake Factory the night of our meal and have yet to get a response.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=220,2.76,2.9,3.124,2.18,2.844
367,Andy H.,"Anaheim, CA",62,296,356.0,1.0,2015-12-19,"I love so many dishes and cheesecakes that Cheesecake Factory has to offer, so I come here pretty often. However, the last few times that I've came to this location I've had unpleasant experiences. A little over a month ago our late night server decided to close our check out and not give us the opportunity to order refills on our cocktails prior to the bar closing. Same thing with dessert, which really devastated us since that's one of the main reasons why we come here. We were not given a heads up that the registers where the cheesecakes are at, were being closed down. The server didn't apologize or seem to care when we brought up our concern. Our party left very unhappy, but we decided to overlook it and we ended up coming back 2 weeks later. During this visit, we checked in with the hostess for a party of 4. We were told it would only be 10 to 15 mins. Eventually 30 mins went by and we noticed that groups both larger and smaller, that came after us were being seated. As soon as we asked the hostess why we hadn't been seated and why others that came after we're seated, we were then walked over to our table. I am not sure how we were skipped since we had a ""pager"", but we were just glad to finally be seated. Now during our most recent experience last night, we left unsatisfied. The food for each person of our party of 4 came out at different times, with at least 5 to 10 mins gaps in between each meal being brought out. Which we found strange since it was later in the evening when the restaurant was slow. Everyone's food was either cold or luke warm. The mashed potatoes were so salty we could not eat them. The server was very apologetic and sweet and offered to rectify the issue. The manager came out to apologize and gave us some cheesecakes on the house due to our unpleasant experiences. We got our cheesecakes to go and asked for my cheesecake to be bagged individually, since I don't live with the 3 other people in my party. I took the bag home that I was told contained my cheesecake and put it in the fridge. Today when I got home from work, I was ready to eat my cheesecake just today find out that the server bagged the left over pasta from someone else in my party, instead of my cheesecake. I am beyond frustrated. Bottom line is, none of these issues should have occurred and there is no explanation to them. These last few visits have left a bad taste in our mouth and we definitely will not be returning to this location even though it is much more convenient for us. We will start going back to Valley Fair.

My boyfriend and I happened to get a waiter that really didn't pay attention to us most likely because we are young and he probably assumed we don't tip (which was bad on his part) but anyways the main reason for my review was because they got my order wrong which I totally understand happens from time to time no big deal. I had the right food but wrong noodles. I was going to suck it up and just eat the meal but I tasted the noodles and they tasted way weird and were awkwardly green. I wasn't going to pay for something that I wasn't going to enjoy. Long story short they took my food and brought me out my other dish and the meal basically had no food.. just nothing but the noodles that I had originally asked for. I don't know if they were trying to teach me a lesson by being up upset I sent it back. It was not great to pay for something and than eat a whole plate of just noodles when I drove 1hr and 30mins just to eat there.

It was a Friday night and they get super busy, so when we were told 35-35 minutes, we decided to grab ourselves drinks and wait. Their mojitos are very yummy. So a while passes, and our drinks are all gone, but we wait patiently, less so as time goes by. Watching people get seated who came after us, I ask my bf to check on the waiting list. He is kind of shy so what the hell, I do. The hosts look at each other and I just knew they messed up. But they lie and say, oh you're next. Whatever. I'm starving. We get seated outside, which sucks, but again, I'm really hungry at this point. And guess what? More waiting. Eventually, a waitress comes by and asks if anyone has helped us, to which we both answer ""no"". She says no one told her they were seating more people in her section and she was on her way out. Ok. That sucks. But she takes our order anyway. And guess what? More waiting. People whose orders were taken after us received their orders before us. Figures. This is just that kind of night. Worse yet, an employee sat at the table next to us with the same dish my bf ordered. Coincidence? NOPE. The waitress comes by, not a minute later, to tell us someone had taken my bf's dish ""by accident"" and they were making him a fresh one. And for the inconvenience? Here's a free slice of cheesecake. We asked to speak to a manager, who very much seemed like she could care less. She basically nodded, faked sympathy, and asked if we got our free cheesecake.

267,Betty P.,"San Jose, CA",21,15,29.0,4.0,2016-02-17,"Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite to go places for Happy Hour. (despite it being for only 4-6 Mon-Fri I think it's worth it). I never had a problem with getting a seat. A lot of their appetizers that usually cost $12 and over, you can get for only about $5-6. Their Long Islands and Mojitos are really yummy.(For about $5 dollars each also) I am in love with their Buffalo Blasts, Avocado Rolls, Spring Rolls and Stuffed Mushrooms. I don't really get the hype about the Fried Macaronis.  Now if I wanted a plate, I would get the Bistro Shrimp Pasta which is seafood drenched in cream sauce with a hint of lemon (that I really enjoy). Oh did I mention the bread basket? It's soft, addicting and is somewhat on the sweet side. We always have to control ourselves from asking the waiter for more and not get stuffed before our food arrives. The Pineapple Mojito on their regular menu is also a must try.  My only complaint is that one of the waiters in this particular CF is a little preoccupied and out of himself. He would forget orders occasionally, wouldn't check on us unless he was serving food or our bill came and there was this one time where we stated that we preferred the brown bread over the white bread, and he instantly just grabbed the white bread from the basket with his hands. I guess he realized what he was doing and just took the whole basket with him.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=160,2.72,2.83,3.068,2.448,2.7860000000000005

The hostesses quoted us a 15-20 minute wait time... It took them over 45 minutes to seat us. STRIKE 1! Our food came out all wrong. The cooks back there could not hit temps AT ALL. Two steak entrees came out Medium Rare instead of Medium Well. Aside from it being hard, the breading on the chicken sandwich was so burnt, it was almost black. On top of all this, they brought out everyone's entrees at different times. Why run food for a table of 6 before completing at least half of the ticket?! I am putting this all on the kitchen. STRIKE 2!  Sh*t happens, I get it. I spoke to John, the manager on duty. Instead of being apologetic, he was dismissive and defensive. He had the audacity to tell me that the chicken sandwich was perfectly fine because he checked the temperature himself. He would have had a valid argument if we complained about undercooked chicken, but the problem was with the texture, color, and presentation. His attitude was unacceptable, and I refuse to believe he was properly trained as a manager-- especially from a corporate restaurant chain. He definitely does not belong in the service industry.  We cancelled the chicken sandwich altogether. We sent back one of the steaks to be brought up to temp, and just packed them both to-go. 3 hours and $200 later, we left the restaurant irritated and still hungry. What did the manager John do? NOTHING. He offered no solution, but a slice of cheesecake on the house. Why would I want dessert when I did not even get to eat dinner??!!! No thanks. Keep your cheesecake, John. STRIKE 3!

390,Courtney S.,"San Jose, CA",12,8,,1.0,2016-03-06,"To sum up my overall experience, only one word comes to mind; HORRIBLE. My fiancé and I only have one night off a week, and we decided to take our night to our local Cheesecake Factory. Being that it was a Saturday night, we knew there was going to be a wait. We were quoted an hour. When we returned, we were told another 20 minutes. 20 minutes later, another 10 minutes. The gentleman at the host stand was less than understanding of our frustration. When we asked him if we had a booth or a table, He rudely responded with ""You have a table"" I asked if it was in the middle of a groups and once again rudely responded ""Your up against a wall"" I made a comment about waiting for a booth and he said it would be a long wait but when I mentioned that I didn't want to wait after the 30 minutes of runarounds a booth happened to open up. Once seated, our server (the only pleasant part of our visit) came by, took our drink and meal orders. I noticed that my spoon looked a little dirty so I handed it off to her, ""This is a little dirty, but I don't need it so its ok."" After noticing my spoon, I took a closer look at the other utensils and noticed ALL BUT ONE were dirty. I asked for the manager and explained to her how unsettling it was that nearly all of the silverware on our table happened to be dirty. I didn't feel comfortable putting those utensils on my food or in my mouth even. Once I got my drink and felt the etching on the glass, I was startled thinking that the glass was dirty too. The manager tried to tell me that one of the knives was only water stains and I kindly asked if she would run her finger along the knife to feel the grime that I felt. Her facial expression changed. She did assure me that she would be speaking to the dishwashers to make sure that this issue was corrected. To finish off my night, I'd like to move on to our meal. My fiancé ordered a burger, and I ordered off the small plates menu, Ahi Tartar and a side of edamame as my meal. My fiancé's meal came out first, our server said she would be right back while she checked on my food. While she was gone, another server came to drop off my edamame and to inform me that they had ran out of the Ahi Tartar. At this point I was LIVID. Was this not an issue that could have been addressed before our food was dropped? So I would have had a chance to order something and not have to WAIT? The server who dropped our food off told the manager who was on her way to address the mess up that I was clearly upset. So she asked me ""Would you like another appetizer?"" Perhaps she didn't know that was my meal? I did decline because my fiancé already had his food, I didn't want his food to get cold while he waited for me to get served, and at that point I was too upset to eat. Once we asked for our check, no manager stopped by to make right by the situation, the server just said that they comped the $5 edamame. I did not mention that the host in the beginning was rude to us, because I wanted to move past that and enjoy my dinner........ but that didn't happen. With a rude host, dirty silverware, and the dinner (or lack thereof) I was just ready to get out of there.

202,Samantha D.,"Santa Clara, CA",5,3,,1.0,2016-04-05,I've had the most horrible experience here tonight. If you are having a large party I do not suggest giving your business to the cheeses casket factory at oakridge mall.   I've been planing for about a week to have a dinner for my 2 year olds birthday. I called 3 days before to see if I could make a reservation since a had a large party and I new accommodation would be tough for a party of our size. I was told no reservations were allowed unless it was during the weekdays the first hour they were open. (In my opinion a horrible rule) but whatever I dealt with it. So I arranged for my mom to get there early which was 530 pm on a Monday (I planned for everyone to arrive at dinner at 730). She put our name on the list. I called and added 3 people at 630 we were told we have to wait an additional hour. ( which we were cool with since I planned dinner at 730) by 8pm my guest who have all arrived were getting hungry and my daughter 2years old had still not been fed. So I finally asked what was taking so long the hostess ( a blond girl sorry didn't get a name) told me it was the guest fault and were taking long with the check. Come to find out it was the servers mistake and messes up the tables bill. The hostess then was totally rude  about me complaining about waiting now 2 hours cause it's 830pm. I was told they only have one table to fit a large party our size 20 . But yet the party we were waiting for was a table of 8. Which I'm sure they gave away our table to. A server then tried to get tough with my uncle who simply asked for a manager and didn't want to speak to anyone who couldn't make decisons. At this time about 845pm I decided to go down to bj's brewery and asked if they could accommodate us not only did they do so they did it with in 5 mins and we had wonderful service and my Daughter finally got to eat her birthday dinner and bj's brew house did a fantastic time job so if your in the oakridge area I'd definitely  recommend bj's over the Cheesecake Factory.

My date and I came in at around 7:00 or so and asked what the wait would be- there was none. We wanted to wait a bit to get some shopping done and they were very polite about it. When we decided to eat later they just put our name on the list to make our seating  quicker. The hostess was very sweet and cheerful, though I didnt catch her name. She was small and blonde, wearing a white scarf. When we came back later (around 9) she helped us again, recognizing us and leading us directly to a booth.

Last night, my mother and I went there to celebrate a work promotion (yay me! But anyways...). We decided to share Avocado egg rolls and an Alfredo pasta. I also ordered a tequila sunrise, in which the waiter asked ME what was in it (wtf write it down and ask your bartender).  First of all, it took days for our food to come out. We waited 30 minutes and our appetizer still wasn't out. He finally brought it out, but we kinda expected our pasta to be out at the same time since it took so damn long (this was when the tequila was wearing off, so I was getting very annoyed lol).  Finally, our pasta came out and it was so MEH. It just tasted like a wet noodle. No salt, no seasoning, nada. I told our waitor after 2 bites that this is not an Alfredo and he quickly apologized and gave us a choice of another pasta. It tasted wayyyy better than what we originally ordered. I'm giving them a 3 star because they handled the situation pretty well. The manager came out (I think his name was Dave or David?) And he said since it would take another 15 minutes for the pasta to be ready, he offered us a complimentary soup or salad which totally helped us keep our hungar down. Our waiter apologized several times and I think genuinely felt bad.

The manager a lady came over did not introduce herself and said she was sent over here by the waiter and didn't know why. I explained to her the utensils were filthy and unacceptable to eat with. All she said was I will tell the dishwashers  and bring you new ones said sorry and left.     ( cheeezzz thanks)""Unbelievable, with six of us we spent over one hundred and fifty dollars for what filthy forks and a knife.

Yesterday I came around 7pm and waited for 25 min which wasn't too bad because it was super duper busy. My boyfriend and I were seated outside and our server was named Roger! He was great at helping me choose between items I wasn't sure on and was also content on checking up on us, making sure we enjoyed everything okay. I ordered the chicken Madira, 3/5 it was good, the dish came with asparagus, sautéd mushroom, mashed red potatoes and also chicken with mozzarella cheese on top. Now for the chicken, they were moist... THOUGH they are very very thin pieces of chicken lol. It's like a chicken breast but they slice it horizontally into 4 long pieces and cut it up into half and only serve 2 pieces of chicken on the dish.  My boyfriend ordered the Cajun pasta, he says it's a 4/5 it was a big portion and had a good spice to it. I even noticed the chicken in his dish was bigger than mine ;( Anyways, we also got the strawberry slushee, 5/5 served in a really big cup! Enough to satisfy two people. It wasn't too sweet, tasted real fruit bits which was gooood. It also came with a big strawberry and orange slice as well :) Aaaand last is the stuffed mushrooms. Came with 6 big mushrooms in a cream sauce and cheese. Really good! 5/5. Our bill ended up being nearly $60 which wasn't bad at all!  Overall, this place is has good food.

As if I had a choice. Waited 15 mins before anyone picked up the line and finally took my order. They said it would take 15-20 mins. 2) parked in the 10 minute parking for curbside to go and called the number posted on the sign. Whoever picked up must have been on a satellite phone in another country because the static was ridiculous, not to mention she was talking a mile a minute. I said ""Hi, I'm calling from curbside parking to pick up my order?"" to which she gave a response so sloppy and fast that I couldn't even make out what she said.

The same person picked up and I told her what the deal was and did she give any type of apology??? NO. She just said ""uh yea, what's your name again?"" AGAIN??? As if she had got it the first time.

He says ""I'll check on them, it'll be just a few more minutes"".  At this point I asked for a manager.

They compt the  chicken and it arrived with her 200.00 check.

280,Carmen R.,"San Jose, CA",2,39,8.0,1.0,2016-12-03,"3 stars, huh!!!!!??? Hopefully this review will bring it down to 2.  My sister had this bright idea to have her birthday dinner at the cheesecake factory, and why not their cheesecake is divine. If this review was for the cheesecake I would have given it 5 stars, buuuut unfortunately it's not. It's for customer service. And as everyone knows I'm a big fan of customer service.  We came in with a party of 12 adults and 4 kids. And having 4 kids in the party we knew to have them fed and napped which we did. However, the hostess here had a different plan. After arriving 30 minutes prior to our planned time we were told we'd have to wait about an hour and a half to an hour and 45 minutes. Ok fine. Most of our tables are ready at about the 40 minute mark. However, these two ladies (who were holding up our whole dinner party) just simply couldn't s-t-h-u. After about an hour and a half the hostess decided chatty kathy and chatty nancy weren't going to be leaving any time soon so they sat us down...right next to them. And the two mentioned above were STILL talking. Which is fine and all, but people please be considerate of your surroundings, I know kindness, and manners are a thing of the past, but common courtesy, I thought, was still in circulation.  So we're finally seated, and jabber jaws are still at it.  We meet Nate, our server and he really tries to remedy the situation but, he got me past my hunger point. Hangry is never a good place for me to be. So in all fairness I'll give him a shot. He did his best but it still didn't help the situation.  Chapter 3: so after we're seated they offer us one complimentary appetizer for the 16 of us. Which takes forever to come out. And when it does it's lukewarm. We order our drinks. Which also take a while to come out. I think that was because our sodas and waters were made fresh.  On to the food the only thing worse than the service, believe it or not. My niece and nephew ordered the alfredo pasta who are only 3 and 5 and they didn't even eat it. It was completely flavorless. Mind you I have yet to see these kids turn down a meal. They ate from everyone else's plate so they were fine. The food is mediocre at best and overpriced.   This was my second time here in about 5 years and it's definitely my last. Unless of course I wanted the chocolate Godiva cheesecake. Then maybe I'll return...MAYBE!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=100,2.12,2.58,2.808,2.308,2.396

The customer service was GREAT because my server Lisa was super sweet and attentive BUT the food was meh. I had the Goat Cheese and Beets salad and lunch sized Meat Loaf. The Goat Cheese and Beets was flavorful and delicious but the size was teeny for the price. The Meat Loaf with Mash Potatoes and Corn was not good at all. The meat was wayyyyy to salty and the potatoes were extremely cold. I was hoping my Reese's cheesecake would make up for it but it did not. The amount of sugar was deadly. After 3 bites I had a sugar coma. In conclusion...my meal was not worth the insane price.

They took our credit card and when bill came back and we opened to sign, the credit card was missing. When we asked about this they immediately went into defense mode. ""You sure? Did you check your wallet? I'm a 100% sure I put it back in"". This escalated to the manager. She immediately said they train their staff on cc's and asked if I'm accusing her staff of stealing the card. I tried to explain to her that I feel that when we give them our credit card, it is their responsibility until it comes back into our possession. I think she disagrees. My family was there we saw the bill being delivered back to my dad. We saw him open it and we saw there was no card in there. Now after my dad explained the card was missing he had to use the restroom. So after we and the staff walked around the place looking for the card we decided to cancel it. My dad is from out of town and a cancelled card is not good. After all this, a staff member said he found the card in the restroom under some trash. Maybe it dropped out inadvertently and some guest took it got the number and tossed it in the trash. Still a staff member looking in the restroom finding the card under some trash? Nice detective skills. When she found out and I was trying to explain that even if the card fell out by accident and some guest took it it was still their fault. All I got from her and the other male manager looking person was ""we saw your dad use the restroom."" ""It happens to other guests"" apparently they have an epidemic of people dropping cc's in their restroom. I mentioned that my dad used the restroom after the card was discovered and we all saw him open it with card missing. No way he picked up the card, fail to put the card back into his wallet, go to the restroom and throw his card in the trash. From a pure customer service point of view take responsibility and stop blaming the customer for the error. Basically they said that we lost the card and they found it what do we want from them. How bout treating us like human beings? So now my dad is without his card while traveling far from home. Thanks Cheesecake. No way did Manager or that other guy try to de-escalate the situation. All we could do was not tip and pay. I have to admit Cheesecake corporate was very nice and offered a $25 gift card but we won't be eating at Cheesecake anytime soon.

Got there, was seated wrong, got cold not fresh bread, requested for fresh bread and it was still stale and not fresh. We requested for water from different waiters several times, even the manager, and did not get any water until we told another waiter about our situation. When we spoke to a manager all he said was ""im so sorry about that, ill be right back"" and he never came back. The lady who was our waitress did not check on us nor look at us after we spoke to the manager. She did not even bother apologizing. Ontop of that she looked at us and actually said ""have u guys been here before?"" I understand waiters ask that question but the way she asked us was not right. After waiting for almost a hour for our food we ended up getting up and leaving. While we were leaving the waitress came up to us and asked us what was wrong and when i told her whats going on and how we wanted to just leave she did not bother saying sorry. She just said okay. We went to the front and asked for the bill for the stuff we had ate which was just 1 appetizer which mind you was served 1) cold 2) with no plates. I suppose they thought we were supposed to eat off the table. The manager did not bother coming back to us, or even apologizing, instead he sent over another waiter, with our bill of $40, including a thai wrap we did not touch, 2 lemonades we did not drink and 1 appetizer that was cold. When we asked the employee why the manager did not personally come and give us the check he said the kitchen is backed up and he is busy there. So, im guessing we were not important enough. We told the employee we will pay for what we ate. He went back and said the manager said its okay you dont have to pay. I felt like i was in a low class restaurant. I went to BJ's brewhouse one time and i found a hair in my food the manager came up to me right away, apologized gave a $50 gift card, took the food off the receipt, and brought me new fresh food, he also personally came up to us to check if everything was okay.

I really want to mention my order number which is 27 on the 19 th of March ,server was a tall well built man who couldn't understand what we were ordering and had to look at the menu which my guess should be a new recruit and who didn't care enough to bring us our water after waiting for 30 mins. Later we had to ask an Asian guy who was serving the next table for what's happened to the starter bread and water, he was like am not 'responsible for ur food n ur service okay!' and he was talking to me like am a freaking 3 year old  and man don't I know servers take up alloted tables in a hotel , can't he be at least courteous enough to say 'ok, I will look for ur server  and bring some water in the mean time'. After a gruesome wait we had to stop a man who was not our server AGAIN and ask to at least bring our drinks, he passed us 3 times after that without glancing .

They sent it back two times and still couldn't get it right.  At least that time they didn't charge me for the meal.  Fast forward to this attempt: I ordered it the same way except at the waitresses recommendation I ordered it well done.  Again it came with everything on it: I sent it back and all they did was remove the mayo, the pickles and onions and sent it back out.  The burger had a overwhelming taste of pickles and was cooked as though it had been at ground zero in a nuclear bomb test!  I thought of sending it back a second time, but having waited for the burger to arrive for over 45 minutes I decided to just take it home and feed it to my dog!  He seemed to enjoy it!   My son ordered the Chicken Parmesan sandwich and found his meal to be lacking any real flavor or Parmesan cheese, he also said this is the last time he will eat there too!

The wait time for the food was about 35 minutes which I felt was pretty normal. My food, sadly needed to be returned. I ordered the vegeburger with French fries. The picture I took was before I attempted to eat my burger. As soon as I picked up my burger I felt the soggy bread, which I felt was because after the burger was made it just sat there. I was okay with this. The part that got me was when the patty broke into small pieces and fell out of my burger. It literally looked like I ordered a rice dish.  I had to wait about 5 minutes before my waitress walked by, and I asked her if this was the norm. She said definitely not and offered to make me a new one. At this point by husband was half way done eating, so I felt that I couldn't wait another 30 minutes for my food. I ended up opting for something that requires no cooking. I ordered Cesar salad and clam chowder. The chowder was completely disappointing as it tasted like potato soup. The salad was yummy, but you can't really go wrong with Cesar salad.  All in all, it was a very average experience. My husband did enjoy his ribeye, and I loved the complimentary bread, and I did enjoy the egg roll appetizer! Yummy sauces! Also, the waitress did take the burger off our bill. Yet, we ended up paying for the salad and soup which I didn't feel like eating and was my only option because my husband had already started eating his meal. By the time my salad and soup came out my husband was done eating. I ended up taking the salad and soup home and is still sitting in the fridge as I am writing this review.

My boyfriend and I decided to give this place another shot after out pretty terrible last experience and this time I have to say I am actually glad we did! If you are going to this location with just yourself or maybe one or two other people, SIT AT THE BAR. Darren is the bartender Friday-Tuesday nights and he is absolutely fabulous. EXCEEDED all I could have asked for and you can tell he knows what he is doing. The food is pretty good as always so I usually don't have much to complain about there, but my 5 stars this time really goes to him individually. He gives phenomenal service and deserves every penny of my tip. I will definitely be back now, but only to sit in the bar and have him wait on us.

How many times have I been to cheesecake factory? More than a dozen. So imagine my disappointment when I spent 17.37 cents on two slices of cheesecake and realize (when I get home) that one slice is totally normal sized and delicious looking, and the other slice (the banana) was thin and small. I didn't bother checking the bag when the woman, who was very nice by the way, handed it to me. I just put it in my car and went home. I was so excited to eat it but it ended up being like less than half the size of the red velvet. What the heck man?? They usually cut all the slices so evenly and they are a pretty OK portion for around 8 dollars each. I am so sad that I wasted my money on such a tiny slice of cheesecake. My BF finished it in less than three bites, I kid you not. Next time I will look in the bag first!!

Today was the WORSE day I have ever experienced customer service, mainly with the front of the house host and manager. We came tonight to celebrate my nieces 8th grade graduation and from the look of it many other were celebrating their own. I made reservations at 5:18pm and the host ""Sasha"", if that is her real name and why doesn't anyone where name tags?. She told me an 1 and 1/2 wait for 7 people. I agreed and I gave her my number, she told me she will call me when our seats were ready. I came back in to check if maybe we got bumped in early, this was at 6:38pm. She then told me another 30 minutes. I said ""ok, we will wait"". As I stood there,  I can hear her tell other customers 3-4 hours, then tell another group of people 15- 25 minutes. I should have known at that point that my family and I were going to get screwed. But I put it in good faith that in 30mintues our table will be ready.  We waited outside, it was getting crowded. At 6:56pm we came back in. I held my phone in my hands to see if they would call me on my phone and waited to see if they would call me out loud. Ay 7:06 pm my sister waited in line to asked the same host if we will be seated soon, since its been 1 1/2 hrs already. While my sister was waiting I can hear Sasah, tell certain customers 45mins wait and tell others 15minutes wait. I want to know HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE? WHY WOULD A HOSTED JUST GIVE RANDOM TIMES OF WAIT?  By the time my sister got to her, she said we have no seats. I came in and told ""how is that possible, we have been waiting over the time she told us?"" She exclaimed "" we've tried calling you"" I told her ""My phone never went off"" with a ton of back and forth she continued to argue with me and then the manager stepped in. With no apology for the inconvenience, he proceeded to still blame me for their mishap. He read out loud my phone number, he begain with 89 and I stopped him, letting him know my first 3 digits were 507. All three, who were behind the counter, Sasha, the Manager and a man named Bernard, (How I got their name?.. I asked their co workers later that evening), still persisted to blame me for giving them the WRONG phone number. WHICH IN FACT WASN'T, because Sasha repeat my number to me as she punched it in. DON'T Lie! The manager still said till be a 30 minute and another man said we'll get you in in 15. Customer service tonight was RIDICULOUS!!! I feel bad for every customer tonight who got duped. We did stay. My niece set her heart out on having her Graduation Dinner at The Cheesecake Factory. I want to shout out to our server, Ileianna J and the other serves who helped her bust out our food and beverages. Shout out to the cooks and bussers, I know its a very busy night. As a person who has worked in the Hospitality Business for over 14 years, that was unprofessional and down right dirty.

250,Davina P.,"San Jose, CA",638,16,3.0,4.0,2017-06-20,"Came here for happy hour since a lot of their appetizers are only $5.95 a plate. The whole place was very dimly lit compared to The Cheesecake Factory at Valley Fair where they dim the lights towards dinner time.  We sat in the bar area and asked for a happy hour menu even though I've already decided on what I wanted to try before getting here LOL.  While the food looked pretty worth for the happy hour prices I decided paying full price for drinks would be better than the HH drinks they offered.  Drinks -  The Ultimate Margarita ($13.50): I love my margaritas and I for sure loved this one and only needed one throughout HH. Whisky Sour ($11.50): My boyfriend felt like it wasn't strong when he first tasted it so I took a sip. It was well made in my opinion and you can definitely taste the whisky and the orange flavors. It didn't have the bad aftertaste since I normally don't like drinks made with whisky or bourbon. He said he liked the drink overall.  Food -  Avocado Eggrolls ($5.95): While I love avocado and eat guacamole almost religiously, I felt like it was too much avocado in the egg roll itself. The cilantro dipping sauce helped to add an element of sweetness.  Warm Crab & Artichoke Dip ($5.95): I've been dying to tried this for the longest time now and I think I might have hyped myself too much. While it was good in itself, it didn't come out piping hot and was too creamy after I got to the second piece of bread that came with it.  Korean Fried Cauliflower ($5.95): My friend who works at Cheesecake Factory told me that it tasted like orange chicken and I've tried fried cauliflower in Utah before so I wanted to try it. While the sweet orange sauce may resemble the orange chicken, the interior not so much. It definitely could have done without the sauce.  Mushroom Burger ($13.95): It was a mountain of mushrooms and even though a bunch fell out, there was even more mushrooms inside the burger. My boyfriend loves his mushroom burger and couldn't even finish it all since it was so ginormous. My eyes were wayyyyy bigger than my stomach because I've had a bit of everything and then got full almost immediately. Maybe it was because I was grazing on the sourdough and whole wheat bread they offered, which was freshly out of the oven and still warm.  Finished my drinks and took the rest of the food to go since I know I'll end up getting hungry later. Happy hour here is definitely best for trying all their appetizers since they're half off. Just wish it wasn't so dark in there all the time. It even got cold in there and I came to escape the heat!

Wish I'd hit the restroom before ordering, though. I tend to judge restaurants by their restrooms. This one was absolutely disgusting. The restroom looked as if it hadn't been cleaned (or restocked) in days. Virtually every stall was filthy and the handicapped stall lacked toilet paper. I always wonder if a bathroom looks this filthy, what does their kitchen look like? It didn't help that all but one soap dispenser was empty. Hope the workers were able to wash their hands.

Every time I crave food from there, it always comes out cooked well and full of flavor.  For appetizers we ordered: calamari and chicken pot stickers. For entrees, we ordered: steak Diane and herb crusted salmon (factory combo) along with chicken Bellagio. The appetizers are always a hit, especially the calamari. The pot stickers were soaked in this really strong ginger sauce, and we didn't really like it. It was too over powering and just not to our liking. Next time we order that (and we will), we will mention, light on the sauce. Our entrees were made to order, especially my steak Diane. Medium cooked. Perfect We also had some adult beverages, blood orange mojito and typhoon punch, or something like that. Both were tasteful. I feel like the only draw back is that the lighting in the restaurant is so dark. I'm not really sure what kind of ambiance they're going for, but it's dark, for me. I don't really like that.

It was terrible. We were party of 9 (including 3 young kids). The person in the front 'Bernard' was very rude and arrogant. We were told it was a 2hr wait. We waited. Even though we could see our table was ready with table ware n everything for the past 30 minutes (as we were waiting on the outside and asked for our table outside they didn't want to let us sit. It was more of a power struggle. Cause it was few minutes before '2 hrs' (mind you we had 3 kids with us) why not just let us sit and settle down. The person in the front kept saying 2hr wait and we won't know until another few minutes. We asked him to come outside and see from his eyes that the table is ready. But he said No to that. He just wanted us to wait and how dare we question him before our time. The table is set for 9 ppl outside for the past 30 minutes. It was our table. He was just very rude. We called the manager, Vincent, he made us sit there right away but no apology or anything. Finally sitting down. Ready to order. We wanted to order pasta for kids with a small change. Change white sauce to pesto sauce. Apparently that was too much for the kitchen to understand. We ordered the big plate in the end for them to share. Then we ordered Nachos without sour cream and add beans. But of course, it had sour cream and no beans. In addition to partly stale nacho chips. Asked for extra plates, they were dirty.

We normally like their food, and have been satisfied with our previous trips. Yesterday, we had lunch here, and I ordered this burrito. If I'm not mistaken, the list of ingredients should be listed in order of quantity of ingredients.  I can say that I had approximately 1oz of chicken in this burrito, along with about 2 cups or white rice, wrapped up in a huge tortilla, with some cheese melted on top. This burrito should be called a Rice Burrito, with a little bit of chicken and cheese. I asked for no onions, but then got no peppers (which I wanted). How can Cheesecake Factory feel good about themselves when the rip off their customers for $17.99 for a rice burrito? I complained about it, and they made me another one. Guess what, more of the same - another Rice Burrito... On top of that, my wife ordered the Mexican Tortilla Salad, which states its topped with Grilled Chicken. She dug and dug and dug and barely found any chicken in her salad. I didn't realize there was a National Chicken shortage happening... maybe it's due to the hurricanes. What a rip-off! As a side note, showed the server and let her know our thoughts. She said she notified her manager, and he was going to talk to the Chef.

They are amazing, and always consistent.....the same every time. The wait for food at the CF on Blossom Hill in San Jose was an eternity, even though the restaurant was the emptiest I have ever seen it (maybe THAT was the red flag I missed). The concoction that was presented as a Cobb Salad, while technically a Cobb Salad, did not remotely resemble what they usually present. The Cobb from CF is always pre tossed, with all the ingredients mixed in, a ring of riced egg around the edge, lots of succulent chicken, and thick crispy bacon throughout. The one yesterday had the ingredients sectioned on the top, bacon bits, very little dressing drizzled on the top (it was very dry, and I had to ask for more). The salad wasn't bad enough to send back, but it was not their usual, and was the same as ordering a hamburger and getting a hot dog. I would never have ordered this if i had only known what I was getting.  The bottom line is that after all of these years, I don't know if I can ever go back.

228,Charlotte G.,"Freedom, CA",36,33,252.0,2.0,2017-10-17,"I've only been to The Cheesecake Factory two times.  The first time was over fifteen years ago and it was with my older sister.  Unfortunately my memories of visiting a Cheesecake Factory are not pleasant.  All I remember was the wait to be seated was long but the food was NOT worth the wait.  I recall having ordered a salmon dish that did not taste very good.  I ordered their Miso Salmon.  Unfortunately it was like eating a frozen fish dinner.  It was overly salty and not fresh.  It tasted very processed.  I believe their over seasoning their food is to mask the fact that the food they serve is frozen and not very fresh. Last Christmas my Boyfriend received a $25 gift card for here.  During the Summer we decided to stop by and use the gift card towards a dessert.  Mostly because of my bad experience eating one of their entrees and with the high prices of the items on their menu, $25 just doesn't go very far.  The parking lot was pretty packed which is to be expected because the restaurant is located within a shopping mall.  We were lucky enough to find parking but I can see that parking can be an issue.  Once we arrived at the restaurant we headed straight for the dessert display case.  They had pretty much every kind of cheesecake imaginable.  From your fruit cheesecakes to the more rich chocolate flavors.  I love Reese's® Peanut Butter Cups and decided to order a slice of their Reese's® Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake.  It had chunks of Reese's® Peanut Butter Cups in their original cheesecake with layers of fudge cake and caramel.  It was cloyingly sweet.  Unfortunately I couldn't finish it because it was too sweet!  My Boyfriend ordered a slice of their Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake.  It's their original cheesecake topped with glazed, fresh strawberries.  He seemed to like it.  To give you a perspective of their pricing, a $25 gift card just barely covered the cost of two slices of cheesecake!  We still have like $5 (give or take) left on the gift card.  Unfortunately the desserts were nothing special and we are likely going to never use the remaining balance on that gift card.  There entrees and cheesecakes are pretty and professionally decorated but the flavors do not match their outward appearance.  Buying a cheesecake here is like buying any old frozen cheesecake you can purchase from the frozen food section of a grocery store.  Which is sad considering the word ""cheesecake"" is in their restaurant name, you would expect them to make the best cheesecake in the world!  Unfortunately that is not the case.  The food is dressed up to look pretty and enticing but when you take your first bite, the actual taste is just okay.  I hate to be so blunt but I need to tell the truth for my fellow consumers.  This place is definitely overrated and overpriced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=20,1.96,2.14,2.424,2.12,2.068

Sure that's fine it's early by the time we would've gotten our table so we decile we will walk around the mall and shop. An hour goes by and we all gather back and decide to wait out the rest of the half hour. It hits the last half hour mark of the wait time. Still table isn't ready they say they're cleaning it. 15 minutes pass. Still the table isn't ready they're still cleaning it. Another 15 pass and they say they're preparing it. Another 10 minutes pass and they say that they're waiting for the other half of the table to leave. So this whole time you lied about the table being cleaned/ready/prepared?? By now it's been over 2 hours wait time and counting. Everyone is very upset because it's already getting late and everyone is hungry. Not to mention it would take another 15 minutes to order and another 45 or more to prepare all the orders. And of course coming with so many orders they leave out some plates and they get cold or under cooked etc (has happened plenty of times before) and of course the manager was no help at all. Will not be returning to this location. You're better off at BJs or Olive Garden. CF quote you a time. But they don't live up to it unless it's small parties.

So back to waiting we went even though I was pretty sure another person did not order 3 white chocolate raspberry and one fresh strawberry.. a few minutes later we asked one of the cashiers and she went to check all the receipt and went to check the ones at the counter and turns out those were ours and plated by mistake. The guy that said no to us saw her taking the plates back and turned and walked away.. not even acknowledging he was wrong. He needs additional customer service training.

My family and I have eaten at cheesecake for years because we have enjoyed the delicious food there, however due to how poor the service has been on multiple occasions we have decided to stop going to the actual restaurant and enjoy the food from the comfort of our own home through door dash. However tonight since my husband happened to be going to the mall I decided to call in ahead of time for our family of 8 and was placed on hold for 25 minutes, at about 10 minutes in I had begin to think that maybe they forgot I was on the line, but worried about losing my place in line and starting all over again I decided to be patient and wait it through, only to wait for a total of 25 minutes for them to pick up the phone and hang up on me!!! As you can imagine I was furious so I called back and asked to speak to the manager who ""happened"" to answer the phone & said his name was Vincent, I explained to him what had happened and asked him what the average wait time was, and if that was how they usually handle phone orders and his words to me were, ""Sorry that happened, we have 2 bakers taking orders & we can't exactly hang up on the orders coming in to take your order, I guess we could have gotten on the phone to tell you we are trying to get to you and to hold on, we are working on getting better.""  Well I'm sorry if you have 2 bakers taking orders and so many orders coming in that a person has to wait on the phone for 25 minutes only to be hung up on, that sounds to me like there is nothing really being done here to help cheesecake truly working on things getting better. Maybe the bakers should be in the back baking, I'm pretty sure cheesecake makes enough money to hire additional people to answer phones so that people aren't having to wait on the phone only to be hung up on. On average my family has had dinner through cheesecake twice a month and this is just the final straw for me. As you can imaging it was already frustrating holding for so long but they were busy and I understood that, and secondly mistakes happen I also understand that but when you are a manger it is your job to diffuse bad situations even when you aren't the cause and I just feel that on top of everything that already went bad Vincent also could have handled the situation better and diffused it much better than he did. So though this review is explaining 1 particular incident it's the final straw that caused me to write this particular review and as far as their customer service goes cheesecakes gets 0 stars, and because of the way they treat people and their poor customer service skills I won't ever be ordering through door dash anymore either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=80,2.2,2.18,2.396,1.924,2.188

Very down to earth and friendly, we were all happy with the service we received. The food was great, I forgot to take a picture but we ordered a Cesar salad, (the croutons were so yummy), chicken taquitos, a green curry dish, and a mushroom burger. That burger was so huge, I couldn't even fit a bite in my mouth so the  burger ended up falling apart, but I didn't mind. The chicken taquitos looked a bit on the small size but I was told it was good! The green curry dish wasn't spicy and had pieces of mango in it which made it even better! We all got cheesecake for dessert and it did not disappoint!!! The mango lime cheesecake was heavenly the whip cream was light and pairs nicely with the cake! The place was busy but service was prompt and they didn't even rush us to get out, so very very happy with time here. Will come back again and hopefully get to see Mary again!!  Thank you!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=60,2.32,2.22,2.408,2.548,2.2600000000000002

I stopped by here with my fam for a birthday celebration, and I really enjoyed the dine-in experience. We came in and were seated about 20 minutes later. We were paired up with Ashley (who was an excellent waitress by the way), and the rest of the night went well. 1) The bread and butter here are delicious and addicting (don't eat too much though because you might not have room for the actual entree). 2) We got all the correct orders, and our food arrived in a timely manner (20~25 min) for five dishes? 3) The Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta was...super good! It WAS expensive (like the rest of the dinner items here), but the portion was HUGE (probably enough for two or three meals, depending on your appetite).  4) Free birthday sundae for the birthday person? Great! It was actually good (but too much whip cream in proportion to the ice cream/fudge). A few down-sides: too dark (I know they're going for the whole dim thing, but it was hard to see even the face of a person across from us...then again, as long as you can see the people next to you, it's ALL GOOD-more intimate and private)+a little noisy (but what can you do? It's a huge restaurant?!)+crowded waiting area (There's already enough seating for around 12 people in the front, but the amount of people waiting seemed to be close to double that amount).

There were always long waits and it was the fancier of meals my family would have. It was always a special occasion if you were dining at Cheesecake Factory (after all, there were table clothes and the waiters wore button up shirts with ties and slacks). My favorite meals here were the chicken madeira and chicken marsala. Dad would get some kind of steak dish and mom might get a pasta or fish. Can you believe the very 1st Cheesecake Factory was open in 1978? I had no idea this chain was around for that long. I came here for National Cheesecake day once because they had a buy one get one half off cheesecake deal. The menu here is huge and portions are large. Their plates are usually good enough for 2 people. I often want to finish my own plate but the calorie content in these dishes are high.
