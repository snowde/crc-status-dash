13,The W.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,17,,3.0,2013-09-01,"We visited on the 28th during the grand opening at Las Plazas Americas. An hour wait or so, typical of the Cheesecake Factory. I had the dynamite shrimp, which was excellent. She had the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta which was very good as well. Services could've been better definitely, but since it was their first day I gave them a pass.. and it was certainly crazy in there.. very long lines!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-juan?start=20,3.0840000000000005,3.0840000000000005,3.0840000000000005,3.0840000000000005,3.0840000000000005
15,Ricardo M.,"Hormigueros, Puerto Rico",0,2,,2.0,2013-09-28,"Visited the restaurant for the first time on a Friday afternoon. After a long  over 45 min wait we finally had a table. Our waiter was very enthusiastic and helpful. We quickly had our drinks delivered and order a couple of appetizers. They were tastylicious. Then we order our entrees. Our waiter did a good job selling us the Kobe burgers . We ordered them medium rare. Unfortunately they came medium well. A $15 burger that was dry , and a little on the bland side. Not worth the wait or the money. May go back maybe in a year or two.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-juan?start=20,3.0480000000000005,3.0480000000000005,3.0480000000000005,3.0480000000000005,3.048000000000001
33,Alberto R.,"Aguas Buenas, Puerto Rico",26,56,49.0,3.0,2014-03-20,"Great expectations often lead to great disappointments and this was no exception.  After the overwhelming first impression of the size and décor of this restaurant that now dwarfs the entrance of the Plaza Las Americas shopping center you will have to wrestle with the largest menu ever seen for a casual family restaurant. Service was quick and attentive in spite of the lamest black or white uniforms last seen on insane asylum workers.  The expensive décor apparently left no budget for more cheerful clothing.   The listing of a ground Kobe beef burger made my choice an easy one. Setting aside the fact that grinding Kobe beef should be outlawed, this sounded like the promise of the best burger ever. My wife chose the Chile Relleno burger done with Angus beef. Both were good, but not up to the star billing promised. In traditional gringo burger style, neither meat is seasoned and depends on the provided salt, pepper and ketchup for any flavor. The included lettuce, one slice of tomato, overcooked onions, and bland mushrooms did not redeem the meat. (See picture) Kobe beef import stopped being allowed in the USA until recently and remains scarce and very expensive. This burger did not say Kobe to me, and their web site calls it ""American Kobe beef"" which is as deceitful as saying ""American Champagne"" In addition to the questionable food, my rating dropped a full star upon seen that all the cutlery is placed right on the table surface at each table. No place mats. No napkins. Right on the top that every hand  rests upon. (See picture). I asked for all new cutlery and was promptly brought new napkin-wrapped sets. Still this is an unhygienic practice that cannot be condoned. The restaurant is also leaving itself open to a major fine by the Treasury Department by not giving the IVU Loto tickets with the bill or credit card transaction. You will only get  your ticket if you ask for it - and are willing to wait until the additional transaction is separately performed.  I am reporting this to Hacienda and I hope that management changes this practice before they are heavily fined. Finally . . . the cheesecakes . . . the raison d'être of this location. They all looked good, but at about $8.00 a pop for a very modest slice, we chose to pass on dessert. Our two burgers, one beer, and one coffee ran a $45 tab after tax and tip. A bit too rich for a lackluster experience. No real reason to come back . . .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-juan,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007
10,Chiqui C.,"San Sebastián, Puerto Rico",1,63,40.0,3.0,2014-04-28,"The food is over price and is as common as you can get. The cheesecakes are really good, but the place is too crowded due to people wanting to try the new place. Go, take a dessert to go at the entrance store and don't eat common food very pricy. If you want a better food, and better cheeseakes, more fresh and better taste, go to Cheesecake Shoppe in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, and you will try this place for desserts only when you don't have the time to travel and the feeling of saving, because you will pay a Puerto Rican chef half the price for the best pizza in the world and the best Pumpkin Cheesecake ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-juan?start=20,3.2760000000000007,3.2760000000000007,3.2760000000000007,3.2760000000000007,3.276000000000001

Food:  Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp: Curry, coconut chicken and shrimp sauteed with vegetables served with white rice. This dish was sooooooo good! The portion was huge. I took half home and it was still delicious the next day! I want some more! I now have a favorite dish at The Cheesecake Factory :) The chicken didn't pick up as much flavor as the shrimp, so next time I think I will order shrimp only. I love the Bang-Bang sauce, I wish they gave me more. 5/5 White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle: yummy! 4/5 Service: I came for a surprise birthday dinner on a Monday at 6PM. We requested outdoor seating for 10 people in the back of the restaurant so the birthday girl would not see us. The staff were very accommodating. It only took them 10 minutes to set up the tables.

But I decided to go again for a quick bite, and give the place a second chance, and I must say that the experience was much better. Shared a Roasted Pear and Blue Cheese Flatbread and the Firecracker Salmon. Both were wonderful. Had a couple of drinks (Cosmopolitans, actually, never had one before), very good. The waiter even offered the suggestion to bring mine in a normal drink glass, and the bartender actually even sent the leftover mix in a different glass. I would say that was very decent and honest of the place and wait staff (have actually seen places were the drink didn't fit the glass or cup and the bartender either drank the left over or threw it out...not cool). Also shared a cheesecake, The Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake with Ice Cream on the side...wonderful but be careful if you do not have a sweet tooth. Overall service was wonderful; our waiter really made the effort to make us feel welcomed and very helpful, though not overbearing. Also the woman behind the dessert counter took some time to explain the cheesecakes and to offer her favorite when asked by my companion. In all, a very good experience. I'm glad I decided to try once again. A little pricey, but I will go again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-juan?start=20,,,,,
