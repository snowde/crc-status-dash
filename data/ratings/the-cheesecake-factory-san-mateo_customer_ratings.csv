872,Theresa F.,"Fremont, CA",0,14,2.0,2.0,2012-01-02,"**HAIR IN FOOD ALERT**Went there for a family dinner, hadn't had my son home in over a year; in the service and lives out of state.  We started with a party of 12, then 3 extras showed up unexpectedly; the waitress was kinda cool about it at first but then got irritated that we had a few more than the original plan because they had to bring out a little table to add to our existing table.  The portions at CF are just over the top huge; I've never appreciated that, it's just a stupid waste.  I had the Chinese Chicken salad--5 bites into it I PULLED A THICK, STRAIGHT, LONG, BLACK HAIR from my mouth. I called the manager over and he stood there and just about said ""what""?  His expression was ""lost"" to say the least. He ""compensated me"" by taking the salad off; then gave me a burger& a slice of cheesecake to go and sent us on our way.  My sis ordered the chicken fettucini but didn't get chicken.  She told the server, who responded with ""you didn't order chicken', then returned with a few scraps of chicken on a saucer for her to toss into the fetuccini herself.  I have never had a bad experience at CF before, but this one was a HUGE dissapointment. My kids ended up irritated with me for calling the manager back twice.  I hold him responsible for our BAD experience. Will go back to Macaroni Grill across the parking lot next time! NEVER back to that CF!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=880,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.6640000000000006,3.1200000000000006
491,Cat C.,"San Francisco, CA",1732,1579,2823.0,3.0,2012-01-02,"Came here with one of my friends a while back after being on a Cheesecake Factory hiatus for awhile.  It was busy in the restaraunt but we managed to get seated at the bar right away.  The one problem with all CFs is that their menu is so extensive...it took us like 20 minutes to decide what we wanted to eat.  We usually don't eat too much and wanted to try some cheesecake so we each got an appetizer and shared the red velvet cheesecake.  I got the wild mushroom flatbread ($5.95) and she got the crispy crab bites ($6.95).  The flatbread was under 490 calories & was a fairly good size and tasty for under $6.  She liked her crab bites too.  The red velvet cheesecake was huge and was under $8 for the slice that we couldn't even finish.  It was also one of the first cheesecakes I tried that surprisingly didn't make me feel like I was going to have a heart attack.  Service at the bar was okay though it was hard to get the bartender(s)/waiters' attention. Overall, CF is an okay choice when you don't know exactly what you want to eat as there are many options, though everything is so caloric and in huge portions, I'm glad they have a ""Skinny"" part of the menu.   Note to all my fellow iPhone users....signal is horrible in here!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=440,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.7960000000000003,3.2000000000000006

The food was alright but I did enjoy their lemon rasberry cheesecake because it wasn't too sweet, thick, or overly rich. The servers were considerate and nice about giving us lots of time to go through their extensive menu.  Even though nothing was particularly amazing to me it had a nice atmosphere, though a bit loud, and it was easily accessible for me.

786,Darius A.,"San Bruno, CA",29,620,34.0,4.0,2012-01-03,Compared to the Cheesecake Factory in San Francisco this place is heaven. The food is much better and so is the service. The wait was only 25 minutes which was bad so we went to the bar and I got the most delicious ice cold Pyramid Hef I have ever had. Prices are reasonable and portions are large.

It's a ""new"" restaurant for the area, so the wait was horrendous, but we waited, an hour. It's dark in there, but aren't they all. Food is the same. Ambiance all the same.  I'm wondering how long the novelty will wear off and if the wait times will be more reasonable? It beats having to pay for parking downtown SF, so more than likely this will be our go to CF. One small gripe, when we ordered our cheesecakes to go there were quite a few already off the menu b/c they ran out. This is the Cheesecake Factory is it not? I understand there aren't people in the back cranking out cheesecakes up the yin yang, but I know that ish is in your freezer back there.

The manager comes over to apologize and offer something else to eat. I politely ask for another salad and say its okay for the other tainted salad.  As she bring the next salad to me, our waitress finally brings over our bread that was supposed to come out 10 minutes earlier.  Finally I get the bill and see that my salad had still been charged. The service at this cheesecake factory was definitely not satisfactory.  If I had a customer find a chipped plate in my food, I would do everything to make sure they are accommodated and that their food will be taken care of by the restaurant or even in this case, a free cheesecake.

Would of wanted to get our order in earlier, but understandable. Daniel, our server, was very attentive during the meal. Refilled my soft drink when it ran low and checked up on us several times. Good server. EXTRA: My guest was under the weather so we ordered hot water with honey and lemon. Does the trick for a sore throat when out and about. ""Guacamole Made-To-Order"", medium ($10.50) with chips for starters. -Next time, remember to have the chips warmed. -Not much of a bite for medium spiciness. May step it up one level next time. -A bit pricy for what it is, but you do get a lot. ""Bistro Shrimp Pasta"" ($17.95). - The shrimp was prepared nice and crispy. -Basil-Garlic-Lemon Cream Sauce wasn't too sour or salty. Just right! -Parmesan cheese on the side to regulate the soaking and taste effect since it is a large dish. -Pretty big portion, especially after being served the warm bread and chips. NOTE:  The servings are quite generous for 2 people, so consider shopping around mall before coming back for one of their famous cheesecakes. Anticipate taking leftovers home if you don't have a big appetite. A pleasant dinner experience. 2nd time at this site. Would go again and recommend this place to others.

868,Terri B.,"San Mateo, CA",14,9,,2.0,2012-01-16,I have been waiting for the Cheese Cake Factory to arrive to the San Mateo area for years. I am a huge fan of this restaurant. The menu selection is very large and the food usually good. Unfortunately this new restaurant at Hillsdale isn't getting high marks from me. I was there a few days after New Years Eve day and a friend ordered the Lua chicken salad. I have had this salad dozens of times at other locations and love it but this had dry and unedible chicken in it. In addtion we had asked to see the dessert menu. Upon our waiter coming to take our dessert order he informed us that they were wiped out on most cheesecakes and the selection was very very slim which was disappointing. Instead of telling us what 6 cheese cakes they did have on hand he told us to keep asking him and he will check it against his list of non available cheesecakes.  Is this NOT called the cheese cake factory?? I always rate a restaurant by the cleanliness of not only the eating area but on the bathrooms cleanliness as well. The women's bathroom was a mess and 2 of the stalls had no toilet paper in them. Mind you this was at 12:30 noon time which says to me NO ONE stocked the bathrooms on the closing shift the night before. I just tried this same restaurant for dinner last night and AGAIN the women's bathroom was not stocked and out of toilet paper in stalls and a mess. I think management has some problems to work out here. The next time I get a craving for the Cheese Cake Factory I think the Palo Alto location will be my choice.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=880,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.7920000000000007,3.1600000000000006

The waitress forgot about us it took us a half hour to get water another 20 minutes to get our drinks oh and my meal was brought to us 20 minutes prior to my appetizers. All before we even got our water Did I mention my Santa Fe salad had the chicken backbone hidden under the lettuce.  Needless to say we did not pay for our meal that night but not because the manger comped us. No after all this he only took $10 of my bill.  I had to advise him that we would not be paying to which he agreed. Well at least he got that right.

First impression - sign in area is absolute chaos!  Several employees talking to each other with their backs to the customers and no organization as to who is first in line.  Then they say ""the wait will be 2 hours 45 minutes"" with a straight face hand you a buzzer and turn away again.   Once seated, the waiters ""overtalk"" and  interrupt your conversation- they often have 2 waiters (one trainee). Been there 4 times - each time they got the order wrong.  Then they expect a tip by handing you a bill and saying ""thank you Miss Jones"" because that is the name they see on the credit card.  Like that is going to help. Twice they were out of Red Velvet cheesecake and the waitress recommended it - once the cheesecake was frozen solid and had to be sent back. Chicken Piccatta is a hot mess on the plate - I was shocked to see her put this mess in front of me.

So Freaking Good! It took awhile to get the entrees, though I ordered 2 appetizers, so maybe that makes a difference. Edamame and Ahi Tartar. The edamame was nothing to right home about. It was decent. The Ahi was incredibly good. Crisp chips were perfect to scoop up yummy bites.  My friend had one of their Crazy-ass huge salads. These people don't mess around with their salads, which is probably why they're all over 1000 calories. Come on, can't you do HALF of that!!?? Seems a little ridiculous to me, but I guess people want their money's worth. We got the check in an orderly fashion and they gave my friend a box to take home the other half of her salad.

Their American-Style Kobe-beef burger was perfectly seared medium (as requested), topped with grilled onions and fresh sauteed mushrooms (which I swear tasted like sliced fresh shitake mushrooms). Excellent. Their thin sliced sweet potato fries were good but could have used a dipping sauce, as a chipotle mayo sauce was served with a full portion, but not with a side order to the burger (unless requested). Service too was good and the waitress even described their special cheesecake (a devilishly inspired Mango Key-Lime over a crust that had shredded coconut in it) that forced us to abandon all hope of splitting a single plain cheesecake slice and getting this special slice in addition. We weren't sorry, although if you are in it for the purity of simple cheesecake, you might have found that there was too much going on.

528,Desmond C.,"San Mateo, CA",80,160,3.0,1.0,2012-03-29,"Avoid this place! (Unless the only thing you're getting is the cheesecake). WARNING #1: You'll get better service at McDonald's. WARNING #2: You're server might introduce themselves and never come back to serve you! And they'll oddly come back at the end of the night to see how you're doing. AWKWARD! CLEANLINESS: 2/5 SERVICE: 0/5 (My first 0.) FOOD: 3/5 - BBQ/Ranch Chicken Salad OH BOY, where do I even start? I'm not a big fan of giving bad reviews, but this location left me no choice. Let's start with the cleanliness of this place. The decor and atmosphere looks really nice, I'll give them that. However, it bothers me that the utensils are placed DIRECTLY on the dirty table and NOT wrapped in a towel like most restaurants. You've seen waiters wipe those tables... if you even call it wiping. Service is TERRIBLE. Probably the worst I have ever gotten from a restaurant in my entire life. Once we got seated, we weren't given the towel napkins and the complimentary bread wasn't served. Then we got our order in. Still no napkins and bread. 30-40 minutes went by and now we're wondering where our waitress had gone. We look over at tables that got seated after us and they already got their bread and food! Still no sign of our waitress. Then another waitress sees us looking around really hard to find someone, and she kindly asks us if we needed help. She immediately notices that we weren't given bread or any napkins. (She saved our day. Thank you!). Here's a snippet of our dialog: Me: Uhm, do you know what happened to our waitress? Waitress #2: Uh, I'm not sure, but let me get you guys some bread. Me: Wait, is she even still here? Waitress #2: I think so, she might be on her break. Me: Oh, okay... Thanks. So, apparently Waitress #1 went on her break without us even knowing. So Waitress #2 notices that we already received poor service (or LACK OF SERVICE), and she immediately gives our table a little more attention. Thank you, again! Now, an hour as passed and finally our food gets to our table. Oh, but wait. THEY FORGOT MY ORDER. Waitress #2 notices that everyone at our table got their dishes except me. She literally said, ""Wait, you're food didn't come yet? That's crazy, you ordered a salad."" (Or something along those lines). I believe she told the manager about the service we've been receiving because he comes over about 10 minutes later with my salad and apologizes. Here's our dialog: Manager: I'm so sorry. We'll take the salad off the bill.  Me: Uh, what's the name of the first waitress? (He didn't say.) Did she just leave because the last time I saw her was 45 minutes ago. Manager: We're required to give our employees a break after 5 hours of work. OKAY. Where do I even start? I didn't ask for you to tell me your company policy on how you treat your employees. At most restaurants, whenever the waiter/waitresses are covering for one another, they come up to the customer and literally tell them that they have a new server for the evening. (THEY DID NOT DO THIS.) Hell, Waitress #2 didn't even know Waitress #1 went on a break! Thank god Waitress #2 saw us looking for some service or else we would of just walked out. We finally get to eat our food (which was mediocre).  Now the most awkward thing happens. WAITRESS #1 MAGICALLY SHOWS UP AT OUR TABLE! Oh god, I don't know what to do with myself. I really wanted to just yell at her, but the whole situation was so awkward. The Cheesecake factory must treat their employees poorly because Waitress #1 had enough time to abandon their customer and then show up towards the end of the night to TRY to service us. Keyword: TRY. Sorry, you failed completely.  I do give kudos to Waitress #2 for saving the night. Also, kudos to the Manager for taking 2 dishes off the bill. Oh, and did I mention it was my brothers birthday? Yeah, happy birthday to him. FAIL. My brother did get a complimentary cheesecake for his b-day. The manager offered cheesecake all around, but we didn't take the offer because it would of probably arrived at the time the restaurant closed. Or they might of forgotten our order. (The place wasn't even busy!) FAIL FAIL FAIL. It was also our first time at this location (probably our last). Maybe I'll come back after a couple years if this location is still here. Hopefully they'll have new employees by then.

So I decided to try it out this time.  When we received our orders my fried macaroni and cheese came in meatball forms.  Turns out that's how its fried and its on top of marinara sauce.  It tasted ok but it was just an overload of carbs.  My friend's spinach dip tasted like any other similar to Chili's.  So it was alright.  I usually look forward to their desert and I ordered the same cheesecake because I love it so much.  The White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle.  There were other cheesecakes that sound appealing but I like this one by far!  Overall, servers are friendly and my friend and I are willing to come back to this location but not during busy peak hours where we have to wait for one hour.  That's a no-no!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=780,2.76,3.03,3.03,2.54,2.9219999999999997

Because the manager didn't care about our poor experience I thought corporate might. So I emailed them and told them of the experience & food poisoning.

The burger was huge and the patty was really tasty and looked like it was hand crafted instead of pulled out of a CostCo bag. It came with some yummy grilled onions and a big slice of fresh tomato. The side salad was a basic mix of greens, tomato, and cucumber with a light vinegar dressing.

The one-year-old Cheesecake Factory is located on the street side of the Hillsdale Shopping Mall. Just like all the CF locations, I like the dark ambience with a lounge-like feel.  Since we were here on Father's Day, the wait for an actual table was a ridiculous 45 minutes. However, I did see the empty bar with the NBA Championship game being televised. So we ran over there quickly sat at the stools to watch and enjoy the game for our dinner...we, as in, my daughter and I...at the bar, folks! Most of the restaurants give huge portions. So my daughter split a dinner-portion Caesar salad for $9.00 and a big appetizer dish of Buffalo Chicken Tenders for $13.50. The Caesar salad wasn't bad, but very hearty. But the Chicken Tenders, with the dipping sauces of Honey Dijon and ranch sauce and Mexican-style corn, was decent and nothing too stunning.  Salad:    Chicken Tenders:  Since we took the train to San Mateo, I opted to try one of the restaurant's patented cocktails: the Blueberry Mojito. The $12.00 cocktail had mint leaves, lime wedges, fresh blueberries muddled up in a glass. Then fresh Blueberry puree, huge shots of Blueberry Stoli vodka and rum. All combine in one tall glass. This is a very refreshing drink and tasted good while watching the basketball game. Cocktail:  We did take home a slice of Red Velvet Cheesecake for $10.00.

The only other time I went to CF for dinner with no line was at the Las Vegas location but I suppose we got lucky that time. As with all CFs, this one has high ceilings and feels huge inside. We got to our tables with zero wait and Service was super prompt and friendly. Typical of chain restaurants, the menu is just overwhelming in it's choice. There are 12 salads to choose from...12! Fortunately, they had my favorite Fish and Chips. Boring you say? Hey, good Fish and Chips are difficult to make. I order it as a Lunch Favorite, meaning a smaller portion compared to the regular Fish and Chips. That's good since (1) it's cheaper at $11.50 and (2) it's not crazy huge requiring a gathering of friends and family to finish. So how good are CF's Fish and Chips? Good, 3-stars good. Not comparable to what I had in the U.K. or Australia but still nicely done. Fish wasn't over-battered, greasy, salty or over-cooked. Just nice flaky morsels of fresh fish coated in crispy batter. Like-wise for the chips. They also had a side of Cole Slaw - julienned cabbage served on a slice of lettuce - had a nice crunch. Oh, mustn't forget the Tartar Sauce which was nice and tangy with chunks of pickles. Didn't go for the Cheesecakes this time but based on past experience, they're a winner - 4 stars.

534,Tami S.,"San Mateo, CA",162,474,156.0,3.0,2012-07-02,"I had been a little apprehensive to eat here... not sure why. Maybe it's the rumors of the ENORMOUS portions, the tales of lengthy waits for a table, and the impression I had that everything was a calorie-fest. But no fear, we were seated right away, service was efficient and friendly, and everything was good. Had a nice Sunday lunch here with friends, and enjoyed sitting on the ""patio"" (which is actually inside the mall).  LOTS of choices -- I can't imagine someone looking through the novel that is the Cheesecake Factory menu and saying ""nope, nothing I want to eat here."" They have just about every taste covered, from herculean salads, to burgers and sandwiches, to seriously substantial meals that probably throw the Weight Watchers point system into overtime. Come here on a Sunday afternoon and you'll also find a special brunch menu. If all that sounds overwhelming to your waistline, the array of selections on the light ""SkinnyLicious Menu"" is pretty decent, too. I ate a salad from that section of the menu and -- while I initially had to go hunting for the chicken in my tortilla salad -- by the end of the meal, I was sated.  Beverage wise, you'll find just about anything you want. I was really happy with my iced tea. They have three kinds: black, green, and tropical. I tried the green tea, and it was a very pleasant, light flavor, with a hint of mint. Really nice and refreshing. This may sound goofy, but it was a surprise highlight of the meal. I've had the cheesecake before, and yes, it's good. There are about 300 choices on the menu, give or take. So, again -- unless you seriously can't stand (or can't eat) cheesecake, surely you will find *some* option to make your whole party happy.  Long story short -- if you're at the mall and hungry, or if your friends are really eager to eat here, don't worry. You will find *something,* if not many things, you'd like on the menu.

I had the Stuffed Chicken Tortillas.  First - lets talk Corn Cakes - I don't know what to say about these except:  yummy.   I let my girlfriends try them - yummy.  The Stuffed Chicken Tortillas - just as good as expected - the cheese, the sauce, the spiciness, the chicken - just right. We then each ordered a slice of cheesecake - I had the kahlua chocolate cheese cake.   We each finished about half - took the rest home :) The service - very attentive:  took our orders promptly, answered questions about the menu, one of my girlfirends essentially created her own pasta combination - angel hair pasta with a red meat sauce - no problem - handled with a smile.   I have to say for a chain - the cheesecake factory almost always delivers.  You know what to expect - and you get it.  Huge portions, good food - not necessarily spectacular but really good.

As for my review i think that this Cheesecake Factory has to be the best one that i have been to so far. The staff are amazing and the food is really good. Sure the wait can be crazy sometimes but believe me it is worth the wait. Also the location is very convenient (Just off HW 101 in San Mateo at the Hillsdale blvd exit).

I came on National Cheese Cake Day (July 30, 2012) and my friend and I expected it to be busy -- it wasn't. They were able to seat us right away, in front of the bathroom. Yup, of all the tables they had, they chose to seat us in front of the bathroom. I kept staring at the ""Restroom"" sign at the top of the door entrance. Okay, the bathroom thing wasn't that big of a deal since it didn't smell, I didn't hear toilet/sink noses, and it's a good walk to the potty. But really, half the restaurant was empty and we get seated in front of the bathroom. Our server was relatively friendly and checked up on us. But not once did we get water refills. The complementary bread wasn't brought out until requested. When the bread came out, it was hard and lukewarm. The butter was solid and cold. I had my favorite dish: salisbury steak with mash potatoes and string beans My entree came out warm, not as hot as other location. Because of the coolness, it took the pa-zzas out of it for me. The meal wasn't as staisfying. The salibury steak also tasted a bit old and not as fresh.Another thing I noticed was that they added pepper to my beans. Pepper was never added to my dish, ever, at all the Cheese Cake Factory locations I've been to. I took the meal home after about 10 bites and ate the rest for dinner. Tasted better, but definitely could have more potential.  My friend and I also ordered the avocado eggrolls. This was delicious! The sauce makes it so much better. It tastes best as soon as it comes out because once it cools doesn't taste as good.  For dessert, naturally, we had cheesecake. Red Velvet Cheesecake to be exact. It was tasty the first few bites but then it started getting too thick because of all the cream and too sweet, again because of the cream. I wish they had more bread to the cheesecake.  The avocado eggrolls were the highlight of the meal. It was disappointing because my friend and I were really looking forward to National Cheese Cake Day.

True to The Cheesecake Factory standards, the portions are very big, especially with the potato! The cheesecakes are the same all around, so I will not have a special comment about that, other than they are good.

I really wish they had a ""No Flash"" policy for parties, we got blinded throughout our meal and I know our neighbors did too, because a large party on the other side kept taking pictures and the flash was so strong it looked like we were in the middle of a lightning.

166,Denise L.,"Sunnyvale, CA",3230,523,3736.0,2.0,2012-10-07,"A definite meh. After an evening of go-karting, we were all very excited this Cheesecake Factory was open late. Our excitement was met with last-string, very unenthusiastic waiters. I understand being tired and not wanting to serve a large group, but you can't let it show. The food was good as always, but the service was extremely disappointing. Let me give you a few examples. 1. My friend ordered the regular banana milkshake, specifically requesting the one with NO alcohol. He doesn't really like the taste of alcohol, so he wouldn't want one in a delicious milkshake, right? So what happens? His milkshake arrives, full of alcohol. When he informed the waiter of the mixup, she acted completely put out, like it was his fault for not being an alcoholic on the fly. 2. The ahi tuna tartare was not available. This was unfortunate as I had been really craving some. The waiter came back and told me they were out, but didn't offer a replacement suggestion or any other information. She just stood there. Finally I picked up a menu and randomly chose something else. 3. The credit card processing took freakin' FOREVER. When we looked over at the cash register to see what was taking so long, we saw the waiters standing around chatting and laughing, while our waiter held our bill in her hand. On the bright side, I discovered a few winners on the menu: - Spinach Artichoke Dip - Cheesy perfection atop tortilla chips. - Mini Sliders - Surprisingly delicious and a good-sized portion. - Papas Bravas - Crispy and tasty. - Asian Pear Martini - Wow! My friend ordered this and I had a sip. Then a few more because I had to make sure it was good. ;) The asian pear flavor is subtle and blended so well with the martini itself. My new favorite Cheesecake Factory cocktail. The tiramisu cheesecake was flawless, as always. TIP: Don't come here for late-night fun. You'll get the last-string waiters who really don't care. TIP2: You don't have to feel guilty about eating so much cheesecake! Order to go, eating several bites at the restaurant and the remaining portion at home.

875,Vivian P.,"San Francisco, CA",25,8,,1.0,2012-10-11,"We've gone to this restaurant several times in the past and when we went to celebrate my granddaughter's birthday, I was very shocked at my whole experience.  Here they are: 1. I asked our waitress when they would be serving bread and butter.  We were a groups of about 22 with 7 young children so we were hoping to get bread right away so the kids had something to nibble on while waiting. She responded with a little annoyed tone in her voice, ""We have to serve all the drinks and get all the appetizer orders first.""  The bread and butter was brought out about 30 minutes after we had been there and 5 minutes before our entrees were served. 2. My daughter ordered a hamburger well done.  After several bites, she noticed that it was not well done and mentioned it to the waiter.  The waiter requested another one.  She never got to eat her hamburger because they didn't bring it until we were done with dinner.  She was given a comp cheesecake for this mishap.  Who likes leftover hamburger the next day? 3.  When the appetizers were brought out, the waitresses were asking who ordered what.  There was a bit confusion, and the waitress threw the plate down on the table. 4. The last time we were there my husband ordered the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp.  It was so good when I tried it that time, that we both ordered it again.  I had initially noticed two larger shrimp and the rest were small salad size shrimp.  My husband's shrimp were the same size as mine, small, and his brown rice was over cooked and crunchy.  My daughter's boyfriend also ordered the shrimp and when I asked him what size his shrimp were, he told me they were all this size - as he had one on his fork which was the same size as the two larger ones that were on our plates.  I mentioned this to the waitress.  She told me that when they don't have the larger shrimp, they'll compensate by giving a lot of smaller shrimp.  The shrimp was the size that you top salads with - SMALL.  The manager came over and told me that they cooked our plates with the wrong shrimp and were giving us two brand new plates to bring home. Needless to say, we'll never go back there again.  It's overrated, crowded, and customer service is less than sub-par for a big group.  BTW, we still tipped the waitress/waiter when we really shouldn't have.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=880,2.96,2.99,2.99,2.6600000000000006,2.9779999999999998

At 8:25 we sat down.  Quite a few menu items were not available, obviously the restaurant had gotten slammed on New Years  Eve and had no deliveries on New Years Day.  Our waitress had to return to our table three times to advise something we had ordered was no longer available.  Calamari and most salmon dishes  were unavailable.  Overall the food was fine, comfort food is usually pretty simple and tasty.  I had the Shepherd's pie, it is always tasty.  The drinks were fine.  table service was a bit slow, in the past this waitress had done a pretty good job but tonight things just were not running smoothly.  We waited for quite a long time just to see her to ask for to go containers.   One desert I asked for she said was seasonal and no longer available, I advised her it was in the cold case in front of the store and still available.  She accepted our order for another cheese cake, vanilla bean  only to come back a few minutes later to advise it was no longer available.   My point it this, CCF is a big chain and should have an understanding of what to keep on hand year to year, someone screwed up as they seemed to be out of quite a few items, wait staff seemed slow and confused as did the host.  They just did not have things in order tonight.  I will return, I hope they clean up their act, have enough staff on hand to handle the crowd, wash the silverware etc.   Also, the mandatory tip for parties of eight or more is BS if they cannot handle the group in a satisfactory manner.  It was over 15%, I think it is either 16% or 18%.  I don't mind leaving 20% but expect things to run smoothly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=900,2.96,3.0,3.0,2.472,2.9840000000000004

We were done eating and she packed out good and she still hasn't brought more bread like I asked. I didn't mention it again because I feel as a server these are things you need to remember.

We were served by two different waitresses at the same time, which is uncommon considering the only time that usually happens is when one will cover for the other if our original waitress is on break.

But these, although small/medium in size, are full of meat. Their mustard and tartar sauces are awesome too, but I definitely prefer the tartar. Only gripe is that it comes with 3 cakes.

I always get one of two choices: the teriyaki chicken or the filet mignon. I ask for the chicken to be boneless, and dozens of times that has meant three smaller boneless, skinless breast pieces. Delicious. Occasionally, it's not prepared the same way. Last week I instead received two giant breasts with the skin. Once I removed the skin, the breast meat was blah and tasteless. When I order the steak, I stress ""no pink"" and suggest that they butterfly it. Still, I've had to send the steak back a few times because it's pink. Also, the seasoning is inconsistent.

I was at this restaurant yesterday for lunch and it was several adults and three small children.  Now, eating out with young children can get crazy.  But Khai was our server and she was fantastic.  For example, when she brought over the bread basket, she also brought a plate with the bread cut up into smaller sizes for the children.  The plate also had cut up banana pieces on it - a very nice touch for the kids.  She always kept our water filled and was attentive and personable.  Thank you, Khai!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=740,3.04,3.06,2.988,2.9640000000000004,3.0520000000000005

I recommend the chicken lettuce wraps and the flatbread with pears and bleu cheese. The reason I didn't give them more stars is that the service can be hit or miss. I have had very attentive servers and one who I know completely forgot about me! Ok I have just lowered the stars to two. I have been back again and If you are dining alone they treat you like a leper.

717,Jordan L.,"Belmont, CA",44,1,,4.0,2013-08-08,"I may be a little bit biased since I am an ex-employee, but if anything - the fact that I don't completely hate this place should really say something about this Cheesecake Factory. There are several things on the Cheesecake Menu that are worth talking about, but my three all-time favorites are the Miso Salmon, The Orange Chicken, and the Gumbo. All three of these dishes are spot on when it comes to taste, portion, and presentation.  The Miso Salmon, which I recommend to get in the lunch size since its 6 bucks cheaper and is roughly the same size, is a typical Asian-style Salmon with a delicious glaze of something that resembles Teriyaki sauce and a Miso-based sauce. Tastes great every time. The Orange Chicken (lunch size) at this Cheesecake is cooked to perfection with an excellent blend of Crispiness and juicy chicken. With a side of rice and vegetables its a simple, yet delicious plate. Lastly, the Gumbo. A new-found favorite! I tried this dish after trying many Gumbos from other restaurants - Kingfish being one of them, and man did this one stand out. The New Orleans classic was an amazing blend of spices and flavors that was served extremely hot (temperature), which is how it should be served. I had it with white rice, but used a whole loaf of sourdough and rye bread to help me take down this massive plate. I was only able to finish half. As for the Cheesecakes, I personally can't handle extremely sweet items, so I would recommend the Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake or the Vanilla Bean, those ones are better suited for the sweet-sensitive eaters like myself.  I give this a 4/5 stars for the delicious food and amazing service (depending on the servers - most give amazing service).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=740,3.12,3.08,2.992,2.7039999999999997,3.0960000000000005

They were both delicious, and for dessert I ordered the strawberry shortcake. In my opinion this dessert trumps ALL of their cheesecakes.

I got the factory combination (steak diane and chicken maderia), which was delicious, but again, the food was at least 25 less than what I've received in the past.

The piece of chicken was smaller.  My sister got the dinner portion of a bistro shrimp pasta but the plate was smaller and the food was level (none of the usual mound of pasta).

Don't get me wrong though. This can definitely be a good thing. Familiarity makes knowing what I want and what to expect much easier. Food is solid. I really like the lunch menu options because they're not too large (so you don't get a bloated, full feeling afterwards) and they're reasonably priced. I also really like the salads (I tolerate salads, so for me to say I really like a salad and would order it again means that it's pretty good). And... well... the cheesecake is what it is. Large, rich, and delicious. But my favorite part of every Cheesecake Factory I've been to is the complimentary bread and butter. I can practically have that as my meal and I'd be content.

Not the newest discovery in a chain restaurant.   However I am fairly sure that when your immediate guests include a bowler who is used to adapting his hearing to constant clanging, banging and high pitched screaming and arguing on the lanes + a couple of military personnel who are accustomed to IED and other explosives going off in short proximity from them  in addition to a number of patrons in their golden years sitting right by us...yet we can still hear your conversations without having to mute our silverware..then clearly you have a problem or just can't wait to hit on the girl you work with huh? Anyways back the food. Having ordered what cheesecake considers their rendition of the ""western"" burger/smokehouse... the first things I notice are the following two things... A)I think your BBQ sauce dispenser literally had an incident of the runs...cause I had to use a fork and knife to find the meat. (Don't complicate that statement)  [-1] B) By the time I did find the meat. I was worried about whether OE not the chef himself had the runs too haha..man was it dry....(don't complicate that statement either).

Everything was disgusting about the cheesecake- the crust was like powdered cardboard (texture and flavor) and I could taste the HFCS. You get a much better tasting cheesecake at Coscto. Seriously. At least I know it's baked fresh there... And the whole thing costs the same as one slice here. The only good thing about my experience here was our server- she was really attentive and fast. This chain is ridiculously overpriced... I can't say that enough. Don't waste a dime or your time. For the prices you can get superb food in SF. Some reviewers like the ones in other cities but I'm never coming here or going to any Crapcake Factory ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=700,2.84,2.92,3.0,2.244,2.888

And of course, some serious cheesecake.  We were here on Friday night and sat through the long wait for an unknown reason. Seriously, I am not exactly sure why we chose this of all places. Anyway, we did and we waited a really long time for our entrees to arrive. An apologetic waitress came to our table with the entrees and a guy with a shirt and tie. One of the managers was holding my entree and he said ""Folks, I want to offer my sincere apology. Your entrees took 28 minutes and that's unacceptable. I'd like to buy  your dessert tonight.""

Since this location is fairly new I gave it a few tries but it certainly disappoints in at least one way EVERY SINGLE TIME... Now let's get started... First of all because Cheesecake Factory is a chain restaurant, there are certain expectations and standards they need to live up to.. The first time I came was about a month after opening and I ordered my regular dishes of crab poppers, crispy fried artichoke hearts, salmon firecracker rolls and miso salmon. ALL THE DISHES WERE 2/3 THE SIZE OF THE OTHER RESTAURANTS. and it took a REALLLY long time for our food to come out. Disappointing. So I didn't go back for a while.  Another time I ordered the crispy crab poppers,which usually comes out in six pieces, it came out looking horrible. It was like one popper had broken and they tried to camouflage it as two so in reality we were missing one.. Minus points on being cheap and crappy presentation. We returned it and they made a new one, but this whole situation could have been avoided if they put some thought into it. The worst part was that when we complained, the waitress said she saw that it already didn't look right when she brought it out....Uh so you were just trying to get by with serving a SUBPAR dish!? Not cool  FFWD to my last time going (as in this will be the last time I ever go to this location, I'd rather make the trek to Palo Alto). More incompetent wait staff..our waitress never refilled our water.. When our salad came out wrong and missing the grapes she didn't even say sorry, she just took it back and threw some grapes on top..it's supposed to be tossed.. One of my number one pet peeves is when they do not take responsibility andDONT SAY SORRY. instead she tries to argue w the customer. Do they teach u nothing here?! Also the bus boy cleared the dish from the table as I still had my spoon in the plate scooping something.. I hate to use the word incompetent so much...but they really are..a lot of them need to go back to training.

Before arriving, I was prepared to choose from a smaller number of selections than those who do not share my dietary restrictions.  When I discovered just how large the menu was with very little attempt to provide for those with restricted diets I was surprised. So many dishes I could not eat. For several of the dishes I was considering I had to ask the server to check with the chef as to whether or not there was gluten involved in the preparation. After a long wait, my choices got narrowed down to just one.  In addition, the place was a zoo with a long waiting time to be seated and long waits between service by very young and seemingly inexperienced servers.

On our last visit, we sat ourselves at a booth in the bar area, like we'd done before, and waited for a server to acknowledge us. One walked in our general direction, and then stopped at the computer station... and the minutes ticked by. Finally, 5 long minutes later, he walked over and asked if we were there for happy hour. When we said 'yes', we were told that we'd have to move, either to the bar, or to the tall tables in the bar area to be served from that menu.  Uh, what? We were literally in there a week and a half before, seated at a booth, and scarfing down happy hour menu items.  Grudgingly, we got up and moved to the little 2-person area at the end of the bar that was dropped down so low that we felt like we'd been seated at the kiddie table at a cousin's wedding.  After that, bar service was a little inattentive (probably because we were 2' below eye-level), but the food was still decent, and the prices were, as usual, unbeatable.  Food: Nachos are big, but the toppings can be a little sparse. Corn cakes are like Chevy's sweet corn tomalito, but gigantic and topped with all sorts of saucy, condiment-y things - right up my alley, since I love things smothered in wetness.

The portion is also HUGE - so be prepared to take home half for lunch or dinner the next day. They also offer lots of bread and what I like is that it's always toasty. I hate when cold bread comes to the table. I also like the setup of this Cheesecake. There's inside seating, inside seating...inside the mall, and then outside seating as well.

Originally the plan was to eat sushi in downtown San Mateo, but my boyfriend and I went on a Friday night and there was WAY too many cars fighting for parking so we decided to come here instead as I was ready to give this place another try.  Coming here on a Friday night around 8pm was a bad idea. The wait time (according to the hostess..) was about 50 minutes for 2 people. Fine. I was hungry and unwilling to drive anywhere so we just put our name down and got the buzzer.. thing. The hostess did inform us that the bar area and the high tables next to it were first come first serve meaning that if a table opens up... run to it. Run like the wind, Bullseye! It took us about 20 minutes for a high table to open up and when it did... we walked super fast to it.  Service... took a while. We sat at the table with the last group's mess for a while watching server after server walk by us for about 10 minutes before a server actually took notice of us and began clearing the table. The server my boyfriend and I got was very friendly and brought the drinks and food to our table as swiftly as possible.  Food wise... eh. My boyfriend's shepard's pie was yum, but my basil tomato pasta was a let down. The penne in my dish was still a little hard to chew and all I really tasted was the tomato sauce. No basil whatsoever. And I don't know if it's just the way it's suppose to be, but the sauce was super watered down. And there was oil floating around in my dish as well. (Go see my photo~) I didn't even want to take it home, but I would feel too bad for wasting food so I'll try to stomach it down later. Overall, eh. Service was good, but the food was just so-so.

For lunch my parents each ordered Renee's special (Half sandwich, side salad, AND cup of soup). The soup of the day was a bean and bacon soup. It was similar to a minestrone, very good! I ordered the lunch Cobb salad with dressing on the side. The portion was HUGE! If mine was the lunch size, I can't imagine how large the normal size is! The salad has plenty of grilled chicken breast and bacon, all topped with egg.  Our server was Jan, I think. He was wonderful! Very attentive and knew the menu really well! When we asked for bread, there was only white bread at the time, but he made sure to bring us the brown honeywheat bread as soon as it came out of the oven (still hot!) When I asked for a box to take the rest of my enormous salad home, he offered to pack it up for me.

531,Jerri L.,"Burlingame, CA",48,21,14.0,1.0,2014-02-27,"Super unprofessional and extremely unacceptable. Called a week before my boss's birthday to inquire about reservations because this was my first time making a reservation. They told me that they do not do reservations, which is understandable. I asked them how would I go about fitting in a party of 18 people. The hostess or whoever answered the phone told me to come an hour before our scheduled dinner for somebody to put our name and number on the list and they will give us a call when our table is ready. I was pleased and a little relieved that we wouldn't have to wait so long if we all went in a bunch.. So I emailed 18 of my coworkers and told them dinner is at 7 p.m.. One of my coworkers was nice enough to head to the Cheesecake Factory to put our name on the list an hour and a half before 7 p.m.. The hostess was extremely rude and told her  ""that's impossible, your table will not be ready until 830 or 845"" My coworker was stunned because that wasn't the plan. She panicked and did not know what to do. Being an assistant manager at an establishment that strives for customer service, this was extremely unacceptable and beyond unprofessional. I was appalled. I had 18 people heading to this restaurant for a big surprise dinner for my boss and this is what happens and this is how they treat us? I immediately called The Cheesecake Factory and ask to speak to the manager to see what was the problem. Patrick, the manager told me in the most condescending tone that the hostess never said. And that he wasn't going to do anything about it and that we would have to wait until 845.  Really??? I was extremely pissed off. I rerouted 18 of my coworkers to a much better restaurant which was Elephant Bar in Burlingame. Not only were they able to fit us in but treated us with amazing customer service and the food was beyond tasty. My boss and my coworkers ended up enjoying our dinner.

But yesterday, I was accompanied with one of my friends and from the moment we sat down, the disaster started.  My friend and I were handed menus and the waitress asked if we wanted drinks. We just wanted water to start and hadn't even glanced at the menu yet, but she came back twice more asking if we wanted drinks. Well, after the horrifying experience, I felt I needed one! My mug of water had a lipstick stain on it! And it was not mine! I thought maybe it was an old stain that wouldn't come off during the washing process- um, no! It wiped off like that stain was just put there seconds ago! I told the waitress and she just said, ""Ew! And ran away with it."" Um, ok. I guess no apology is needed.  It took about 20-25 minutes to get some bread, and that's after we waited and asked for some. Nice cold, hard bread. Did this chic just not like me?  The chicken in my pasta was a little burned. Didn't eat it. The pasta was bland. My friends lettuce wraps were all blackened on the ends. My friend just looked stunned when she sees that and the waitress goes, oh they're big so u can put a lot of stuff inside. Yeah, we looked like that bc the lettuce was black, not bc they were huge lettuce leafs. Dang.  Whatever.

The last 2 times I ate there, they made us wait in line for over 30 minutes even though 1/3 the place was still empty claiming they weren't staffed enough. THIS IS A TACTIC that many chain restaurants take which is similar to how night clubs make people wait in line to create an atmosphere of demand and popularity. Then, when we wait, the servers are hustling, but they are clearly understaffed. It takes 10-15 minutes of hailing servers to get the bread basket and a meal took 90 minutes. My kids are very easy going, but 90 fricken' minutes after waiting 30 minutes even though restaurant was not full for a 2 hour meal at the Cheesecake Factory?! Ludicrous. So recently, I went with my 7 yr old and they told us 15-20 minutes wait. We waited, and waited and after 25 minutes they told me only 5-10 more minutes. My patience was already boiling and I knew it would be a 1 hour+ wait to even get the food. WE BAILED. We ate at BK in the food court instead for $10, and with all the money we saved not eating there, we bought ourselves some jelly beans and gummy bears, got a Hello Kitty item and a couple cookies for dessert. What a great evening. No thank you Cheesecake Factory, I am never coming back because your service sucks. Food: 4 stars - I think the food is solid, and they give good portion.

That night, we were pushing our time pretty tight to closing time (11PM) but managed to get there 30 minutes prior. Soon after parking, and making our way in, we have realized how chill, quiet, and space of parking their was. We got the closest parking spot and hardly anybody was there, so I must say it jumped our night just a bit in a positive manner, so thats a plus! After being seated by our lovely waitress, LAURA P, she greeted us with such gratitude and a lovely smile, and gave us time to make our orders. Small conversations and such, with our environment being slightly quiet at this time of night, it was quite beautiful and chill. Our waitress gave us apple time to make decisions and also helped us choose what kind of craving we were looking for, which definitely helped us narrow our results down to something worth trying, and was quite impressed. The appetizers of Bread and Butter was delicious, and fresh to the touch. My date then informed the waitress of how great bread was, which the waitress took into consideration of bagging up some wheat bread for us. I was quite surprised by this random act of kindness, and we both had really big smiles on our faces.  After receiving our orders of the Hibachi Steak and the Bistro Shrimp Pasta, we just stared at our food... then of course, INSTAGRAMed it lol. Then continued to enjoy the rest of our meal. Speak on behalf of the steak (Since that is what I have ordered) was tender and made with love lol Shortly after mentioning that the dinner night was intended for missing her birthday three weeks prior, it was my late gift for her. Our waitress Laura P, was very generous and had such a sweet heart, and seemed spontaneous. A few minutes after mentioning that, she brought us a bag of wheat bread, an Icecream with a candle, and sung happy birthday... even though it wasn't her birthday lol.  Overall, the food, service, and quality was great.

813,Dani C.,"San Mateo, CA",0,2,,1.0,2014-08-16,"I going on the record to say that cheesecake factory is one of my favorite places to eat out with friends and family. There food is amazing and they have huge portions. But the service at the Hillsdale location is a load of crap. Having crap service a few times, I can let it go. And by a few times I mean anywhere from 3-5 visits. But after that, something needs to be fixed. I'm not picky and I guess that's why have let so many bad services just brush off my shoulder. But today was the last straw. I work in Hillsdale mall at one of the stores and because I like Cheesecake factory, I have a menu to the restaurant. I know they are busier on the weekends, so when I know I'm going to be taking my lunch break, I call in advance 20 to 30 mins before so that by the time I take my lunch the food is ready. Today I called at 3 pm, and was placed on hold. Which is normal because they have to transfer you over to takeout. At most, you're on hold for about 4mins. Not today, they put me on hold for more than 10mins, and at the 10min mark, I decided to use another phone and call them again to ask what the deal was because no one was picking up the takeout line. the person on the phone apologized, put me on hold again on the second phone and I was hold for another 3 mins. I had 2 phones going on hold, and they never answered the original call I made. finally they took my order, which was a mushroom burger. Simple and easy. The girl who took my order told me that it would be 15-20mins and they would deliver it to my store, so I wouldn't have to come get. I said cool and paid the bill over the phone. Now all I had to do was wait, which meant that my food would be at my store by 3:35pm at the latest, which was the grace period she told me. 3:45pm rolls around and no sign of my food. Now because of the grace period she gave me, I waited to the last possible minute to clock out for lunch, because when you work in retail, you only get 30mins. I had to clock out for lunch at 3:30pm and my food should have come by then. So I call them back at 3:45pm to see if something happened. What I was told was "" sorry, but we got a little busy, but I have someone bringing your food right over"". I said ok, I still have 15 mins left in my break, that's enough time for me to eat and be back in time to work. So I waited and waited and no one showed up with my food. So I had no choice, my lunch break was over and I had to clock back in, hungry and annoyed. Finally at 4:05pm, the food arrives and the first thing that comes out of the girls mouth is sorry about the wait but here is your burger and I just need the card you used to pay to get the card number. I give here my card to copy down and I tell her in a calm but stern voice that I am disappointed with the service, and that all they had to do was call me to tell me that it was busy and I should come get my food. You had my cell number and my store number, a quick call was all I needed. Don't offer a service with a time frame and not hold your end of it. All she could say was sorry and left my store. Not 5 mins later after she left, I get a call from cheesecake. No message so I called it back to inquire what they needed, they had delivered the food(cold and soggy) and I had paid when I ordered the food an hour previous. When the guy answered the phone, I told him that I had gotten a missed call from them and no one left a message and his response was ""I don't know, maybe someone in the bakery called, did you order something?"" I ran through the situation with him of what happened and that I had finally gotten my food, and all he said was"" sorry about the wait, on your next visit with us that won't happen and that I hope that this experience wont effect my decision to come back to there establishment"". I proceeded to hang up because I was beyond frustrated with him and the staff no owning up to there misgivings. Saying sorry doesn't fix things. I never asked for anything other that to provided the service that was told to me on the phone when I ordered my burger. Not once did I ask for a discount or something free due to there crappy service even though with everything that happened, should have been offered. After hanging up on that call, 10 min later, I get another call from them, so I answer. According to the woman I am talking on the phone with(by the way, she was the manager on duty) the girl who wrote down my card number forgot to write down the expiration date. I literally wanted to jump through the phone because I was so angry. How hard is it for people to do there job. So I go get my card out of my purse for the third time and give her the info. I proceed to explain the whole situation again to the manager and all she says is sorry, and that we got busy. Guess what, I'm a manager in my store and I get busy to and if you have people waiting for you the least you can do is just keep them informed. It's not that hard.

I appreciate all the help they provided me on that special day and I was extremely happy with our food, service, and of course, my birthday.

There were some hiccups with the service, but some nice rebounding by the staff smoothed things over. A soup I ordered never showed up, but it eventually came out at no charge. That was nice. Salad dressings ordered on the side with two entree salads didn't come out with the salads, they came 5 minutes later. And my son's toast was very oddly toasted - golden and toasty one one side and white as a New England snowfall on the other. But the good points of our visit here were very good indeed. The opening bread basket  (light and dark loaves) was terrific. The menu is gargantuan, and CF gets bonus points for having such a varied menu including a lot of calorie friendly Skinnylicious choices. And then of course, there are the desserts.   I had a cup of the tardy Enchilada Soup and it was terrific- chockful of tomatoes and cheese and tortilla strips. I had a Skinnylicious Chopped Salad with blue cheese and chicken- it was great and pretty darned big. We had three slices of cheesecake -a blueberry/white chocolate, an outrageous chocolate, and Snickers. Yes- they were fabulous. Our server was wonderful, polite, courteous, and quick to remove the soup from our bill. That was a classy move. Our dinner with desserts ran $70 and we felt that it was a great value since we hauled a lot of the meal home for midnight snacks.

I ordered an Asian chicken salad and requested no onions and dressing on the side and about 20 minutes later I get a salad with dressing on it. If I weren't watching my macros I would have just eaten the salad, but since I have to be strict with what I eat I had them remake it. Basically by the time I had got the second salad about another 20 minutes had gone by and I was totally starving and kinda hangry. To make matters worse when my salad arrived I tell you the truth that it was just a bunch of puff. An avalanche of lettuce and rice noodles with approximately 2 oz of Mandarins and about 2 - 3 oz of chicken breast. In all honesty if I'm going to be paying $15 for just a salad then you have to at least put a decent amount of chicken so I can actually justify paying this much. In all fairness I would say 5-6 oz would be the right amount for $15 and I'm sure your still making money off my $15 salad. The whole thing was a HUGE let down and I wasn't going to say anything, but when the waitress came and asked how everything was, I simply stated that it wasn't so great, because there was hardly any meat on there. I guess she truly listened to my honest complaint and also acknowledged that it did take a really long time to get my food, because the order got screwed up in the first place. So she decided to comp my meal, which was an awesome generous thing to do.

However, they do make delicious cheesecakes and we always order a whole cheesecake for special occasions. They get one star for that. I've never dined in this particular cheesecake so this review is for their takeout. I was craving a healthy-ish salad last week and wanted something I could pick up on my way home. I decided on their ahi tuna dinner salad and my husband ordered the tamale cakes. The tamale cakes were good, so they get a second star for that. The ahi tuna dinner salad was a box filled with mixed greens, 2 thick slices of tomatoes, some slices of avocado, and 4 small pieces of seared ahi tuna. For an $18 dinner salad, I expected more than 4 pieces of tuna and at least some tomatoes that were properly sliced. I literally could have gone to Safeway and bought a bag of premixed greens, a tomato, and an avocado for a quarter of the price. I felt jipped.

One night, my boyfriend and I went to dinner which ended up costing us around 70 bucks. We got the check & left the waiter a tip, but we neglected to scratch a line thru the tip section on the receipt, so this asshole decides to take advantage of this and charges himself a 20 DOLLAR TIP after we already left him one IN CASH!! We didn't even notice until my boyfriend saw his bank statement & wondered when the hell we spend 90 dollars at the Cheesecake Factory.. Now the second time we went, it was for a friend's birthday. We started off with a waiter but half way thru our stay there he turned it over to another waiter & guess who it was? The asshole waiter from last time. Well it looked like he remembered who we were because he avoided eye contact & rarely came to check on us. This time around I ordered nothing but a soda and a cheesecake. Only two people in our group are actual food. We asked if the check could be divided according to what each of us had ordered & he told us we could only divide the check in half or pay the full amount. BULLSHIT. I've been to this restaurant plenty of times & they have divided the check upon our party's request. Well I didn't argue any further & paid for the whole party's meal with my card. Of course I didn't forget last time's incident so I scratched the shit out of the Tip section on the receipt & on top of that we left no tip. Yes. You can call it a dick move but considering what he did last time plus he didn't check up on us for refills or anything else we may have needed that night. Well the gathering concluded & we were halfway to our car when the waiter calls after us ""Did you mean to purposely not leave a tip for me?"" WTF. Really?? He really had the audacity to chase us outside the fucking restaurant just to complain about his tip. As far as I'm concerned, tips are not required unless stated somewhere by the establishment, on top of that, you get an hourly wage, if that isn't enough find yourself a better job.

Our server hasn't returned or checked in or apologized or brought the check over despite walking past the table several times. We're all done eating and just want to get out of there. We had to flag down a busser, ask them to print out the check, and bring it over. To their credit, they did so immediately.  The server made their way over five minutes after that and cluelessly asked if we wanted any dessert. We assured them that we were all set, had the check, and wanted to get out of there. Rather than taking the check, they cleared two plates and dipped, also never to be seen or heard from again.

It was two big pieces of thick bread with a thin egg layer. I don't know what exactly made it brulee-d. Also both my pieces were pretty burned on the edges. I had to cut around a lot of it. Also I think it was $12 for the two pieces of French toast and no sides. Not really worth it. I'd go for other options. My friends had the burgers, lunch portions of the entrée and full size entrees. We also got a side of fries for the table and it was like a huge overflowing plate of fires - a lot. The full size entress are almost $20 but it's pretty big portions. Oh and the table split two pieces of cheesecake - lemon meringue and the godiva chocolate. Good thing, we were all pretty full and the cheesecake was pretty rich. Service was fine.

But it's precisely what the name describes it as. A place built for cheesecake. The cheesecake here is awesome and can probably take up all of your cheat meals for the next year. But as a restaurant as a whole it isn't all that hot. I have been there now multiple times. Every time I go I try to order a different pasta, hoping that it will turn out better than the first couple of times. Every time I go I am let down again. For the attire, it looks like a fancy restaurant, no doubt. But it doesn't match the quality of the food. Most of the food here also can have you put on a couple of pounds and has you feeling full for the next week.  Bottom line: Come here for cheesecake and nothing else. You could probably come for some food but overall it isn't worth it.

I went with my parents and some of their friends who couldn't speak English very well, but he was very attentive and he tried his best to meet our needs.

Of course they only had 1 type of bread to serve but it was our favorite any way. As for the rest of our meal, my wife ordered the spicy crispy chicken sandwich w/buffalo sauce, what she got was a spicy crispy chicken sandwich, dry. There response, the buffalo sauce is mixed into the batter, well that pretty much gives it NO flavor when we're expecting buffalo sauce coating the chicken. I ordered the cajun chicken littles. As I chewed into one I noticed it's not a chicken texture. I looked into it and it looked like a hard noodle but it turned out to be squid/calamari. I pointed it out to our waitress, her response ""Oh sorrry, I hope you're not allergic to squid!"" Wow well if I was CF would be looking at a lawsuit. I even tried to get a floor managers attention ( 2 guys in button up shirts and a name tag) but of course they could care less and just went about their business making sure more tables were cleaned fast to (reload customers) and cleaning up the mess in the back (twice dishes/glassware were dropped loudly during our visit).

There were times where the servers were attentive and the meal went smoothly, and there were times where we were neglected and it took an insane amount of time for our food to come out (compound that with an 1.5 hour waittime) which made the experience horrible. A friend ordered chicken with their pasta(cost extra) and they forgot to put it into the dish. After inquiring about it, it took an extra 20 minutes for them to bring it out. it might have just been an off day, but somethings are inexcusable.  The total meal time took over 3 hours(from waittime till the end of the meal) which wasted a huge portion of our time. However, The portions on the food are pretty decent and the cheesecakes are delicious, but for the price of everything, it might be better to choose a different restaurant for a better dining experience.  I have also experienced their happy hour. The appetizers averaged $5.50 and the portions were good.  The drinks however were really watered down. The tuna tartare was good, but they gave very little. We also tried the Buffalo blast, crab and artichoke dip, and the happy hour burger. All were delicious but all greasy, so if you are a health nut, I might steer clear of this place.

I get there and the girl in the front tells me to hold on for a few mins to see how long the wait will be, I probably waited five mins just for her to tell me the wait time would be 30-35 mins ok no big deal. Mind you there was maybe another party waiting so I believed we came at the perfect time. Five minutes later we started seeing a lot of families coming in one after another parties with the same amount of people as us seven. I decide to go to the mall and have my mom dad and sister wait, it's been 45 mins since my check in and when I come back my family is still waiting. They tell me they've asked and nothing has happened. I talk to the girl who originally signed me in to see what was going on she tells me that a table is getting ready and they're just cleaning it up and that it will be a few mins. We waited 20 more minutes and still no call. I go up to another girl working the front and tell her I'm upset that it's taking so long and that a few mins turned into 20 mins she tells me that the table is being cleaned AGAIN by this time I'm very irate and ask to speak to the manager. Chris the worst manager I have ever met in my entire life. He was extremely unprofessional, rude and egotistical. I approach him to let him know he tells me my table is being cleaned which apparently is their cope out for any waiting customer and this is pretty standard from what I can see. I tell him I didn't want this to turn into another 20 mins after all we did travel two hours just to come here. He never apologizes or even tries to make eye contact with me and stares at the computer screen the whole time. He says to me "" well I can check but I'll be walking away from you"" like.... I really cared for his company go check!!!! I wait by the waiting area after he told me to give him ""five"" minutes and to my disbelief he never goes to check on the table like he said he would. I time him. After 5 mins I went up to him and told him that it had been five minutes he sighs as if I was bothering him and proceeds to tell me to get my family and wait on the side when they finally sit us.  I don't know what was worse the manager or the super burnt meatloaf they tried to hide from me by flipping the meat over. Thankfully I took a picture so you guys could see. The waiter apologized and removed the plate and said he would involve the ""manager"" I told him it was fine to just let it go... You would assume someone would still come to your table and apologize but no.... Which was not surprising.

The turkey burger was great. It had melt in your mouth onion and mushrooms. The salad it came with was lightly dressed and very generous ($10.95). The margarita on the other hand was mostly ice and not much Rita! I literally drank the entire think in 3 sips ($10$)!   My hubby had the Huen crusted salmon. The word crusted makes it sound like the outer part of the fish will be crisp but it actually isn't. It's very soft and has potential to be very delicious. I feel like it was missing seasoning and a acid in the sauce. Don't get me wrong, it was good but needed that little push to make me crave it next time ($17.95).  My LO ordered the quesadilla. It was huge. She loved it! What's not to love? Flour tortilla, lotsa cheese, and wee bits of chicken ($6.95). The kids meal also comes with a free drink.  All in all we love Cheesecake Factory.

Not a terrible wait time considering it's around dinner time, even if it is a Tuesday. We decided to wait and the hostess have us our little pager.  While we were waiting, one thing we observed was that the hostesses weren't using the pager to notify people that it was their turn to be seated. Approximately 45 mins passed before my wife decided to ask one of the three hostesses how much longer we'd have to wait. The hostess told us less than five mins. By this point my son was getting really hungry. Another 10 mins and 15 people getting seated passed before my wife had to once again inquire how much longer it would take to be seated. The hostess callously states to her, ""In a minute."" We were finally shown to our seats without a single apology for the wait time and when we got there, the entire row was empty...seriously?

In the mean time I request them to provide us just with a set of seats since my parents were having problems sitting in the reception area. But it fell on deaf ears.  So at 3:00pm(or thereabout) we get our seats. Once seated it takes another 15 minutes for a server to show up. Remember that the restaurant is near empty.

When we got seated, the waiter introduced himself and asked if he could get us anything to drink, and that he was taking over for JP while he was on lunch. (I wish I could remember his name, but this was on 9/21/15 around 7:15pm.) He brought us back our two waters and we asked for a few minutes to look at the menu. He came back and took our order. All we ordered was the crab and artichoke dip and a bacon bacon cheeseburger with everything on the side.  15 minutes passed and we were still waiting for our food. Then 20. He came back to our table and specifically said, ""Let me go grab your food for you."" I assumed that meant he was going to the kitchen to get our food for us right? He never came back. Another 10 minutes passed. I had to get up and go over to the registers where I saw him standing and talking to other coworkers and ask if someone was going to get our food because he never came back to check on us. Then he says, ""Oh, yeahhhh you've been waiting like 15-20 minutes right? A manager didn't come to your table? Someone accidentally took your food and they had to remake it. So the manager should be bringing it out shortly."" I then saw someone in a maroon button up shirt (who I assumed was the manager) observe us during the conversation, but he didn't say anything at all while I was asking the waiter where our food was. There were two other waiters around us that checked in with their tables almost 3 times each to make sure they were okay. We sat there and no one came back to check on us.  First off, if you're already acknowledging that I was waiting 15-20 minutes for my food, you should have checked in with us. Second, I wouldn't have cared so much that someone accidentally gave our food to another table and that we waited so long for it, but not once did you communicate that with us while we were sitting and waiting for our food. Third, a manager didn't even come to our table to apologize for the inconvenience, nor did they bring our food out for us like the first waiter said they would.  JP, the waiter who was on break, came back and introduced himself. He was very nice and I actually almost felt bad for him because he had to clean up the mess that the previous waiter left.

But wait, when the ""Kids Chicken"" came the plate was hotter than the sun (not a great idea to put in front of a 3 year old) and the chicken was harder than shoe leather. We think it was microwaved because the rest of the plate (potatoes and carrots) were tough and jello like consistency. So we didn't even get to eat that. Then our turkey burgers arrived and were drier than the Sahara Desert, but at least they could be eaten by our kids and us, so we shared this.

There were a few other tables that sat a good 30 minutes after us and got their food right after us. And my boyfriends food was cold and the chicken was rubbery. We also noticed that every table around us left before our food even came. We were so disappointed because she didn't even check up on our table or anything.

I've been to a few locations in the area, all with great food, but am giving this location three stars based on service.  Our server was very friendly, but he always seemed to be standing near the bar chatting with the other servers. He rarely came around or asked if we needed anything, so I was left to go to the bar myself twice. Once to ask for ketchup and once to get drink refills. He never apologized when he saw me standing at the bar and didn't make a point of coming around to see how we were doing after. Disappointing since even at the most busy locations such as downtown SF, I have always had superb service. The guac is my favourite thing ever. It is made to order just the way you like it. It's not packed too full of ""stuff"", so you can actually taste the extremely fresh avocado. Chips are great too, never stale. It is always a must when I'm at The Cheesecake Factory.  This time I had their cheeseburger. The thing is HUGE! I could only make it through half and took the other half to go. It hasn't been frozen and is cooked just the way you like it - I ordered mine medium rare and it was perfect. I got mine with a side Caesar salad which was also good.  The bread was brought to the table right away and our drink orders were taken soon after we sat down. No issues there.  The hostess could have been more friendly. We went during lunch and had to wait about 20 minutes. No smile, no real greeting, just a straight to the point number. It wasn't a deal breaker, but not what I'm used to. This particular location is in the Hillsdale Shopping Mall making it very busy on a regular basis. There is lots of parking close by and they offer curbside pick-up which I think is great.

280,Ken C.,"San Mateo, CA",26,71,2.0,1.0,2015-10-21,"I've been to several Cheesecake Factory locations and I have to say this is by far the worst.  The food isn't terrible, but it's not as good as the others.  For one, their Chicken Piccata is way too oily.  Their Steak Medallions are also over-seasoned.  Not to mention that each piece of steak is a different degree of doneness.  I ordered mine medium, but the pieces on the sides are well-done.  The ones closer in are medium-well, and only the center pieces are medium. But the food itself doesn't warrant a 1-star.  The service does though.  The waiters and waitresses are okay.  They do a fine job when the restaurant isn't busy.  What really ticks me off is their bakery counter, where people pick up their food to go.  Every time I order food, I always ask for wheat-bread only.  90% of the time, they either 1) give me both types or 2) don't give me any bread at all.  Also, 100% of the time, the bread will be smashed.  I don't know why they do this, but they always squeeze two pieces of bread together then wrap it in tin foil.  If I really wanted to eat panini bread, I would've asked for panini bread.  My latest trip there today was the same deal.  What's worse is that when I got there, the person at the counter said the wheat bread won't be ready for another 10 minutes.  I said I can wait, so I stood on the side.  15 minutes passed, no bread came out, and none of the people at the bakery section were doing anything.  They were just chatting and hanging out.  So I went up and asked them if my food is ready, and that's when they went to the kitchen and found out everything was already ready.  So basically if I didn't speak up, they wouldn't even check up on my food.  Yea, great service.  I wish I got her name so everyone can avoid her, but you know what. I think the whole bakery section is full of people like this, so it's best just to never buy take-out here.

There's good about this location: It's near the mall, you can walk from across the street and park there (conveniently located by Barnes and Noble), and the food.   I know it may be controversial, but I love the food at Cheesecake Factory.  Maybe it's because I have a relative who worked here and I know the detail that goes into some of the food.  An example would be the lemon ricotta pancakes during Sunday brunch--they're fab and they serve them with real maple syrup.  I love the Crusted Chicken Romano (that sauce omg) and Chicken Fettuccini with Sun-Dried tomatoes but I think the latter has phased out.  My current favorite dish is the Cajun Chicken Littles (see pic); they're really great--the chicken is juicy and fried to perfection, served with mashed potatoes and corn/veggie hash.  I remember when they used to give you a whole ear of corn with this dish!  I guess they needed to increase profits.  Anyway, we also go the chicken n biscuits (see that pic too); they also recently changed this dish--perhaps now it's a little smaller and the biscuits are different, more corn-like and less classic buttermilk--so it's a negative in my view.   Finally, the other reason people come here, the pumpkin cheesecake.

We called our waitress, Amanda to let her know and her response, ""oh it's supposed to be like that, it's cooked in butter!"" Wrong answer Amanda!!! That place needs to train their cooks to serve quality foods and train their waiters & waitresses to have a friendly customer service approach and learn to apologize to their customers when they are unsatisfied with their product.

And then we ordered a crispy chicken costolleta and a chicken sandwich without cheese. The waiter got the sandwich with the cheese and we had to send it back. They then just scraped off the cheese, turned it upside down and gave it back. The chicken was overcooked and rubbery and we traded it for a fish taco. The taco was laced with barbecue sauce and didn't go well with it. As for the crispy chicken costolleta, it was just breaded chicken with a lot of butter and some lumpy mashed potatoes.

317,Roderick T.,"Daly City, CA",23,32,353.0,2.0,2016-01-08,"I like the Cheesecake Factory.. this one in particular, not so much. Went here for dinner last Wednesday night, just to hang and grub with some of my family. I usually go to the one at Macy's in downtown SF, but this location was more convenient for everyone that night. It took a while for us to get seated, about 40 minutes or so. That was a bit annoying. I assumed there wouldn't be too many people out since it was a weekday. Perhaps folks are still on holiday. As we were seated, though, I noticed a lot of open tables. I'm thinking maybe they were understaffed that night. For the sake of brevity and comprehensiveness, I'll go through my qualms via bullet points. - Bread. First things first. Hook us up with dat bread doe! We got our drink orders in quickly enough, but didn't receive our basket of baguettes until our libations were ready. We need some of that light sustenance to keep the hunger pangs at bay! - Drink orders. One was wrong, plain and simple, another was way too sweet, and the wait time for all drinks to be served took longer than usual. My cousin ordered a margarita, and she was presented a mojito. All coo I guess since our waitress realized her mistake and got the correct order in. My sister, on the other hand ordered the strawberry lemonade, and she didn't receive it until well after the first two cocktails were delivered. Really? And to make matters worse, the beverage was entirely too sweet, even after diluting it with water. She eventually had to order a different drink midway through our meal. - Food. Overcooked, slightly burnt, and a little salty. My sister and girlfriend both got the Bistro shrimp pasta, and in both dishes, the shrimp were slightly overcooked and burnt. Normally the battered shrimp are golden brown crispy, but this time they were visibly darker brown (even in the dim lighting) and chewy. My girl also commented that the angel hair pasta tasted bland, and she had to constantly mix the plate in search of more flavor. I ordered the meatloaf dish, and found it to be a little heavy with salt. To be fair, it is a hearty dish, and the flavors are meant to be bold, but I was only able to eat one slice of three, and only a portion of the mashed potatoes and gravy. It made for excellent leftovers, though! My cousin ordered the Hibachi steak, and though it appeared burnt upon first inspection, it turned out to be fine. Again, the dim lighting didn't do any favors. 2 stars = ""Meh. I've experienced better."" The Cheesecake Factory is a chain restaurant after all. This location is simply not my favorite. I prefer the one in downtown SF. Protip: Learn from our mistake! If you're in the mood for a sweet, non alcoholic beverage, try the frozen iced mango, if you don't mind slushy drinks. We used to get this all the time when we were younger. It's no longer served in the tall, slim glass of yesteryear, but it's the same tasty drink. Make it a strawberry or cranberry frozen iced mango if you want the added red swirls!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=120,2.04,2.19,2.576,1.608,2.1300000000000003

After watching party after party getting seated I again check-in and they claimed they had called me. Total BS and the pager never went off.

So basically an hour and 15 minutes later we were seated from the quoted 30-40 minutes. Where upon we were put in a section with 5 empty tables and promptly got ignored for another 10 minutes. Throughout the rest of dinner pretty much had inattentive service. The food was OK as typical. The fact that the ""manager"" did nothing to make reasonable amends and seemed to just put us int he ""B team"" service area, invariably as punishment for having the audacity to ""complain"".  We finally got done at 8:28PM!

So you would think that in all of those pages, you could find something you'd actually want to order. Some signature dish. Some reason this restaurant exists. But guess what? Not really.  The food is perfectly, completely fine. Just fine. Not a review any chef will ever tack to his wall and celebrate.  Maybe it's because the menu lacks anything approaching originality and the selections are equally overpriced. It is interchangeable with The Elephant Bar, in fact, another restaurant without any recognizable style or take on cuisine. They both delight in serving acceptable food in atmospheric environments. Good. Great. That's enough for some people. And I have come back to The Cheesecake Factory several times because it's tucked inside the Hillsdale Mall and therefore conveniently located when I'm shopping with the family. But I won't be going back any time soon.  Let me paint you the picture of my final visit. It's noon on a Wednesday. The restaurant isn't yet crowded -- it will be; I'm convinced San Mateo's residents never eat at home -- and even so, my huge, untenable party of three must sit and wait for fifteen minutes while the staff prepare our table. Or continue Snapchatting. Whatever it is they're doing while they avoid customers. Our waiter is an inattentive millennial with black tribal earring plugs and a myriad of tattoos. He graces our table just once in 60 minutes; never stops by to refill water or soda, to let us know why the appetizers we ordered haven't come out, to ask if we need anything, or even to flip us the bird. He is a millennial phantom, disappearing into the ether along with our order.  About 30 minutes in, no appetizers delivered, I bet my wife that all of our food will show up together. 20 minutes later, it does. Except, half of our items are missing, including lunch for our six-year-old son. I can't even complain to our original waiter because he never returns; rather, he dispatches another waiter to deliver our food. When I inform her of our situation, she goes to fetch him, at which point he materializes one last time, says he'll remove some of the undelivered items from our bill, and then vanishes again without a hint of an apology. Not fine dining. Just ""fine"" food served by distracted doofuses. This franchise ain't special to begin with, and this location is especially stupid. Don't support it.

Ok bro...I can respect that BUT an inch+ of foam?!? You're tripping... A table opened up so we moved there and Justin D gave me an annoyed look and made me pay our drink bill first before moving. Sat down and after about 10mins had to ask for the table to be cleaned and then had to ask for a sever so we could place our food order. One finally came after I asked again...  This guy was ok, attentive but brought out bread that was room temperature which just added to our annoyance. We ordered the stuffed mushrooms and chicken lettuce wrapped tacos and it took almost 40mins to come...  The mushrooms were room temperature and the sauce even developed a film...it was disgusting.

They then apologized for their mistake.. But by the time we got there, it was just a mess. We got forks .. But no plates. Drinks but no water, even after requesting it. Flagging down a waiter was hard enough too.  I overall really liked our server though. He was a very sweet guy. However this experience was just ridiculous. The food was good / decent , probably a little bit on the salty side. But overall, we spend about 100 after taxes & tip (I used to serve so I know tipping is important).

Like so many chain restaurants, the Cheesecake Factory has a hard time with consistency in quality, availability, and service.  We've had some REALLY GOOD dishes here... only to return and be disappointed with REALLY BAD versions of the same dishes.  Often items on the menu are not even available. One of my favorite dishes is the lemon chicken served with carrots, greens, and mashed potatoes.  When done well, it's truly a work of art.  But sometimes, it turns out to be a disaster with dry, overcooked meat and dried up lemon sauce.  On one visit, I ordered it for dinner only to be told 10 minutes later that it was not available.  Really?!  By the time, the server returned to take my ""new"" order, I was 20 min behind schedule with the rest of my party and completely out of synch. I've had similar highs and lows with plenty of other dishes on the menu. The huevos rancheros used to be another favorite of mine... but they switched things up and no longer serve it on corn tortillas.  Instead they use super greasy, fried tortilla shells and spiced up the dish a lot. My wife introduced me to the coconut curry chicken and shrimp and it was heavenly.  So, on my next visit I ordered it and it was over seasoned and disgusting. Service is also very inconsistent.  In a recent visit, they served my younger son a raw hamburger.  So, we asked to have another one cooked for him. Our server told us he would put a rush order in.   15 minutes later after the rest of us finished our food and having not seen our server, I had to track down a manager and inquire about my son's burger.    We were told that the order had not been placed.

The shrimp angel hair pasta was alright, just lacked a bit of something.  The avocado egg roll appetizer was also good but even with the pasta and appetizer split between my mom and I, we could barely finish everything.

Oh right... the line, long wait during peak times and sometimes the service.  I come to this location multiple times a month. Sometimes the meal goes by smooth and wonderful and other times there would be a deafening fire alarm, service charging 3x the tip that I wrote which the manager compensated with a gift card however that said gift card had $0 when I tried to use it, taking over 10 minutes for missing lettuce and the list goes on.  However every time the food really shines. I love their Miso Salmon, Thai Salmon, Fresh Basil and Tomato and Flatbread, Wild Mushroom Soup, Fresh Kale Salad, Pasta, Shepard's Pie and lunch portioned items! It doesn't hurt they also offer a Skinnylicious Menu since most of their dishes are quite excessive in terms of fat and calories.  I have to admit I'm not much of a cake person. I rarely ever eat cake or cheesecake for that matter. However if I really had to eat a cheesecake then I enjoy their Vanilla Bean Cheesecake. It's one of the few that isn't overly drenched in chocolate and has a very yummy vanilla flavor.

This review is specifically for her. My party arrived at 11:40am and we weren't seated until 1:30pm because of Michelle. When we got there, we were told that our wait would be no longer than 40 minutes. 40 minutes passed and we checked on our table. They said that the party seated at the table designated for us had already paid and they were just waiting to clean it up. Another 20 minutes passed, so we went to go check again and Michelle gave us the run around, saying that people were ahead of us when in reality, we were there the longest. Just before that, they said that we already had a table. All of a sudden, we don't?! We waited another 10 minutes, all the while Michelle is talking about us to another employee with us within earshot. Disrespectful. Another employee came and asked if we have been helped and we told him not really because Michelle was of no help. Within a minute, we were seated.

133,Mark O.,"San Francisco, CA",112,54,3.0,1.0,2016-05-08,"Went here for mother's day and had the worst experience in a long time. The reason for this review is an incredibly rude waitress named ""danielle/daniella"" if I recall correctly and while the manager did a great job in trying to right the situation, I don't think he understood how rude one of his staff members were. Here is a brief run down of what happened (I will shorten ""Danielle"" to D for the sake of brevity): 1) D starts off normally, we were all smiles and excited to eat after a long wait, which is normal at the factory. She takes our order, leaves and all seems well. Cool!  2) Comes back after a bit and says, ""What did you order? I forgot."" Okay, no problem! I repeated my order and said it's totally cool thanks for clarifying.  3) We ordered 2 drinks, one hot coffee and one iced coffee. She brings two iced coffees. We say, ""sorry but we ordered a hot coffee and an iced coffee"". She doesn't say anything and just takes the wrong order back. She seemed angry about her own error and me being anti-confrontational, I apologized to her when she came back since she had to go through getting the right order. ""D"" ignored this. Furthermore, we actually felt bad to ask, but she forgot cream and sugar so we asked for that too. At this point she seemed to be losing patience. She asks, ""You two want MILK or CREAM?"" we were like ""ermm I guess both?"" I mean, we must be pampered brats if we want cream and sugar with our coffees right?  4) She comes back with even more simmering frustration and drops the creams without a word. She never offered water so I had to wait to flag her down just to ask for a couple of iced waters. I asked almost timidly at this point b/c Im assuming she's having a REALLY bad day and I'm trying to give her a pass. She responds, ""I'll get to you"" in an angry tone. At this point we are really questioning why D is so dismissive and angry at a mere request for water. She could have just said, ""sure"" and I wouldn't have thought twice about it. Instead it was more like, ""leave me alone, how dare you make me correct my orders and NOW YOU are asking for waters TOO?""  5) D waitress comes back with, surprise, only 1 water. She is teaching us a lesson that we were acting spoiled when we wanted creme and sugar with coffee. Now we need to make do with only 1 cup of water. She drops it off again without eye contact or saying a word. I'm still trying to be nice and said, ""Thank you, I appreciate it"" and this is met by a stonewall of silence and D walking away. Now we are moving from timid confusion into full fledged indignant anger at paying to be treated like an unwanted vagrant in this fine fine establishment that manufactures cheesecakes.  6) Manager comes in at our request and was very apologetic and polite. However, it seemed like he was just saying sorry in general and didn't really acknowledge how poorly Miss ""D"" was treating us. He offered a glass of wine which we refused but appreciated as a gesture and said he will have a chat with ""D"". He did a good job based on how steamed we finally got at that point so he (I think his name was Chris?) has no bearing on this negative review. We appreciate him trying to make things right. Conclusion: ""Danielle or Daniella"" was such a rude, resentful, and angry waitress that we are never coming to this branch again, despite our general favorable opinion of Cheesecake factories in general. If this particular waitress is fired, hopefully nobody will go through such a random episode of poor treatment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=160,1.96,2.06,2.364,1.7320000000000002,2.02

I came in with my family the day before Mother's day. I have always been dubious of the Cheesecake Factory, but this visit will be my last.  SERVICE 1/5: We were served by a gentleman with glasses. Not so sure what his name was, but if he is reading this review, he will know. When we first sat down, we already notice that a set of utensils were missing - I asked the waiter and he quickly forgot about it. He would disappear for long periods of time without checking up on us. Whenever we had our waters refilled, received bread or butter, it was only because we asked him to. I understand that that the restaurant was busy, so that was not the biggest issue.  FOOD 1/5: If it were possible to give 0 stars, it would have definitely happened here. I ordered the fish and chips lunch, while my SO ordered a sandwich with sweet potato fries. When the dishes came, the dishes looked fine. However, after taking a bite of the fish, it was the exact opposite of fine. I am not even sure what I ate till this day - the fish tasted very off. I would rather order a filet-o-fish from McDonald's at this point. The biggest issue was the sweet potato fries. We told our consistently absent waiter that the sweet potato fries were both cold and soggy, a very bad combo for sweet potato fries. He didn't apologize for the quality of the food and disappeared for another 15 minutes. When he came back, he gave us the SAME order + more of the cold fries.  When he dropped off the check, our waiter never apologized or said thank you. Well, thank you for letting me know where to eat for next lunch - not Cheesecake Factory.

The sauce was much more thin and there was a ridiculously large amount of (overly) toasted coconut on top. It changed the whole texture and flavor profile of the dish and I ate less than a quarter of it before letting my server know I was disappointed in it. She simply asked ""Have you actually had the dish before?"" It should be a manager's job to troubleshoot my complaint, not hers. If there's a guest complaint, a manager needs to get involved. To her credit, she did apologize, but no manager visited the table to address my concern; she most likely didn't tell a manager at all.

I'm not typically crazy for chain restaurants but I think CF has a massive menu, the service is beyond good, and the ambience is relaxing and on point. I was recently having dinner at the CF with four of my best girlfriends. It was Bonnie's special birthday, and whenever it's any of ours birthday, we really have a good time. Since no reservations are allowed, we luckily only had to wait a mere 15 min for a party of 5 on a weeknight at primetime. We each started with a cocktail. I won't bore you with what everyone ordered....just mine. So here goes.... I had a. Cosmopolitan in a fancy glass. It was really tasty!  We ordered a couple of appetizers, since we each were ordering our own Entree.  One appetizer was the Avocado Eggrolls, it's Avocado, Sun-Dried Tomato, Red Onion, and Cilantro Fried in a crisp wrapper. Served with a Tamarind-Cashew Dipping Sauce. That was to die for!!!!  One of the stars of the evening. Our  second appetizer was the Crispy Cuban Rolls, Crispy wrappers Filled with Slow roasted Pork, ham, Melted Swiss Cheese, Pickles and Mustard. That was tasty as well, however just a little burndt on the ends. Our third appetizer Warm Crab & Artichoke Dip, a blend of Crab, artichokes, and Cheese Served Warm with Grilled Bread.  That was Excellent!  Our group can make a meal off the Appetizers Menu alone. For my entree, I had the Pasta Carbonara. Excellent, Excellent, Excellent. I always order that, because it is ALWAYS Epic!!!!  I just love it. The shrimp that's added is perfection and the noodles are done just the way I like it.   The gals loved their entrees as well. Whoops...forgot to mention we had a couple of bottle of Pinot Grigio. Lol. For dessert, I had the Tiramisu Cheesecake which was so elegant. Thank god I didn't lick the plate clean. All the girls had different, various types of Cheesecake.

85,Lisa W.,"San Francisco, CA",107,183,1089.0,5.0,2016-07-02,"Always wanted to try this place because of their well known cakes and dishes. I only came because my cousin wanted to celebrate my birthday earlier and today was the day where everyone was free and not so busy. This location is located next to the mall so it's very crowded around dinner time because ya know, everyone is hungry. Wait time was 45 minutes which wasn't so bad considering on how many people were waiting for a table as well. We got a booth because we had over seven people(eight later on) and we got down to ordering right away. The server was super nice(forgot his name) but he was our server till the end of our stay. We got our drinks and free appetizer aka bread and butter within five minutes... woo!! Since the menu is so grand and so many to choose from, I was super indecisive if i wanted pasta or if I wanted a rice/mash potato plate(it was definitely going to involve some carbs tho ha). I ended up going with my first choice the Cajun jambalaya pasta(linguine pasta w/ shrimp,chicken,peppers, and diced tomatoes). Everyone's food came within ten minutes or less which is amazing considering on how packed this place was. Their portions are huge so you really get what you pay for. After all my pictures and my shenanigans, I got down to eating since it smelled/looked so good. The taste was what I just expected as what it described on their menu. It was the perfect amount of salt with the right amount of spicyness which wasn't too strong to handle. After eating my plate that I literally shared with almost everyone, we ordered one slice of tiramisu cheesecake aka my favorite. The cake looked way too beautiful to eat but it's really good and it's not the type of cheesecake where all you taste I cheese, you really taste the flavor they say it is. Overall the service and the price point you pay for the portions are awesome. I think this is the restaurant to come to if you're looking for something better than Oliver Garden with almost the same prices and a better flavor to their food. One con was that the food was a little too oily for my lips and tongue, I had to constantly wipe my lips down haha.

That said, the Cheesecake Factory in San Mateo is nice, and a popular place for shoppers. I really enjoy their hibachi steak. It is steak with beautiful flavors of mushroom and onions, sweetish with an Asian taste. The mashed potatoes are seriously indulgent and goes really well with the drippings of sauce that's laid on the beef. The meatloaf is also quite nice, and complex. The flavors are tangy and meaty, just what I would expect meatloaf to taste like.  I think most people really like the sides. Cheesecake Factory does not go wrong with their sides. There is a certain level of standard when it comes to chain restaurants and this is probably the only thing that's worth mentioning. Consistency has always been on point. The service though, that's another story. They seem to love to under employ and many of the waiters/waitresses are too busy and make no eye contact. My waitress also forgot the asparagus that came with my hibachi steak and when asked she was so sure it didn't come with it though it was stated on the menu. She said it was really weird that it said that on the menu, but I've been there a few times this year and had the same thing. Nothing has changed. I don't think it's weird.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=100,2.56,2.23,2.3,2.128,2.362

He simply said ""I'm not a cashier"" and turned around and walked away before I could ask him where I could go to order. I stood there for about 5 more minutes but neither one of the two people behind the counter turned around at all. I walked away and the person who walked up after me looked to be in the conundrum. I walked over to the hostess stand to ask where I could place an order but she was taking a very long time checking people in and she looked annoyed as each person walked up..

36,Liza W.,"Moss Beach, CA",82,214,83.0,3.0,2017-02-03,"According to the Yelp standards of what three stars mean, then, yes, The Cheesecake Factory at Hillsdale is ""A-OK"". I give this place a fairly decent review not because this is the most stellar place to have dinner (it is a chain restaurant of course), but because, where else can you bring a five year old for her birthday and get food she will actually eat at reasonable prices, in an atmosphere that is loud enough to drown out your kid's restaurant shenanigans, yet cozy and dimly lit enough to trick yourself into feeling like you are out to a ""fancy"" dinner? Why, that would be The Cheesecake Factory, at the mall. Yay, mall. Also, my child is head over heels for the Build-A-Bear a couple doors away, so she gets her annual birthday Build-A-Bear, and then we hop over to The Cheesecake Factory for a casual birthday dinner with new toy in tow. Happy Birthday to a little one! All of the above reasons are why there are multitudes of families waiting by the dozen to be seated at this restaurant on any given evening, especially on the weekends. The typical wait for the dinner-busy hour is around 20 minutes. Expect that, every time. It could be longer and it could be shorter, but don't hold your breath. I don't frequent here much, but when I have come here on occasion, the service has been mostly pretty decent. Tonight, on a Friday night that was extra busy, we lucked out with an excellent server. And it really is sheer luck. I eat from the Skinnylicious menu here. Let me tell you, the skinny menu is the saving grace of this place, otherwise you are eating a billion calories at a time. All of the entree choices on the skinny menu are 590 calories or less. They also have ""Skinnylicious"" drink choices which are 150 calories or less (so I always get the skinny Margarita on the rocks). From the skinny menu, I had the steak medallions which came with mashed potatoes (a very small portion!), asparagus, cherry tomatoes, and shiitake mushrooms. Oh my god! OH my god! I honestly could not believe how good this meal was. The steak was cooked to perfection. The marinated sauce on the mushrooms (which normally I dont like Shiitakes at all) and the lightly sauted tomatoes with asparagus was all so mouth wateringly delicious! Part of what keeps the calories down on the skinny menu are that the portions are normal sized, not hugely gigantic  like the portions on Cheescake's regular menu. I was so surprised at how good the medallions were that I kept announcing how good it was while I was eating it, hahaha. My daughter's bow tie pasta with fresh marinara was light, cooked perfectly and really tasty as well. The cheesecake was bypassed this time, because a very chocolate, chocolate birthday cake was waiting at home for my one-track minded newly-minted five year old! But, the original cheesecake with fresh strawberries is usually a favorite to share with the table (a couple bites is enough!). I can't eat all that crazy crazy sweet stuff they make the Cheesecakes into, but apparently that is what people love about this place.  Anyhow, if you come here, be prepared for longish waits, especially on the weekends. Don't arrive if your kids are already starving because they will be melting down by the time you get a seat and as all parents know, when that happens, you have hit that cranky button that is hard to turn off. If you accommodate this place and its long wait times, then you can make this place is an occasional go-to for families. It is decent enough.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=60,2.12,2.3,2.196,2.1879999999999997,2.2279999999999998

As soon as she said that the manager came to our table to apologize and let us know that our order went to the wrong table. So to make up for it a slice of cheesecake was on the house. We figured that was so sweet and he mentioned our first order of appetizer would be removed from the check, but when we looked at our bill the check included the loaded baked potato which we never received. So we had to fix our check and it made it super inconvenient for us because we had to wait even longer for a fixed check.

We frequent the Pleasanton location and have been to San Mateo as well as other ones in the US like Austin, TX. I have also posted reviews of those. The good at this location is the bartenders do have to work hard which they do and the food is quality like you get from your average Cheesecake factory (this is a good thing).  This particular location is understaffed and can be disorganized. For the plethora of options in San Mateo for miles and miles, they will struggle unless service improves. What drives me crazy is that the Hillsdale mall does not currently have a food court and Paul Martin is super pricey so if TCF was actually solid all-around they would probably be pouring in the customers and cash.

We walked in and were poorly greeted by Andy, the woman at the front. We were a party of seven and were told that there was an hour wait. The place was empty, at 9pm, but still an hour wait. So, we opted to go to the bar area to find some seats, as we were really hungry. Seeing that the tables were small, we asked if there was any way we could sit in a booth (we had a baby with us and it would have been easier). Michael, tried to accommodate our hungry group and right when we were about to sit down Prince (the Indian server) came to our group and rudely stated that we couldn't sit there. He was insensitive to the fact that we had a baby with us and empty booths all around. There is a way to talk to people and the way that Prince came at us was really unacceptable. We told Prince that Michael said it was okay and then Michael just denied it. Really?! Seven people heard you say it was okay, Michael. We are paying customers that just wanted to sit and have some food. There was absolutely no need for the attitude.  After that, we were desperate and decided to squeeze into the high table. Twenty minutes later, no menu, no napkin, no service, we decided to leave.

318,Laura C.,"Novato, CA",1,10,10.0,1.0,2017-02-27,"Wow I RARELY leave yelp reviews because really all I care about is food.. Lol and this place has good food! However I would only recommend getting takeout. THIS IS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER RECEIVED EVER. I get that places can have off nights but based off the reviews it seems like this particular restaurant has a rude, lazy, poorly organized staff. I would describe them all but it would take me too long because there was not one employee in that restaurant that I would even consider hiring if I were an employer, so if you walk in wondering which ones are a*****les, it's all of them.   It started out with simple things such as not greeting us politely when we walked in, then our waiter would take 15-20 minutes at a time between checking on our table filling water and bringing our food. We pretty much had to flag him down or stare at him until he noticed us every time we needed something. He forgot one of our entrees and then completely disappeared 10 minutes later we finally flagged down another server who told us she would go get a manager, then a manager came and told us he would figure it out then left, then our server came back and told us he would bring out the order fresh but by that point everyone was done eating so we asked for a box and guess what they didn't box it, another random server brought out the dish and when we asked him to get a box he never came back with one.. it just kept getting progressively worse. We waited so long for our check we had to get up and again seek out a manager who told us he would find our server and then just never came back.. then our server messed up our check. Twice!!!!!!!! the worst part about this insensitive manager is that he just walked around carrying a drink in his hand (non alcoholic) talking to the other employees who all looked like they didn't give a f**k about their job. It still took another 15 20 minutes to get out of that place and I have never been so disappointed by restaurant staff in my life.

15,Tiffany C.,"Los Angeles, CA",2001,829,6047.0,2.0,2017-03-02,"I've been to my share of Cheesecake Factories and this San Mateo location is one of the worst ones I've been to, due to service, wait time (of the food), and the quality of the food. So this location is located in the Hillsdale Mall - meaning that the wait time can get super long. And even though they give you the beepers that will vibrate when it's time for you to be seated, the signal doesn't reach too far so you pretty much have to wait around Cheesecake. When we arrived on a weekday night, we were told that the wait would be over an hour long. We decided to wait it out, and luckily it only took about 30 or so minutes.  But the wait for our waitress to take our order, refill our drinks, refill our bread, bring us the check - we ended up staying at the restaurant way longer than we should have. She seemed to be having a really bad day, her face reflecting her somber mood, which definitely translated in how she served her customers. We could tell that she really did not want to be there.  The complimentary bread was good, and we got seconds because the wait for the food was too long. Shirley Temple was also decent if you want a refreshing drink.  As for the food: Miso Salmon: This has always been one of my favorite dishes from Cheesecake, but I don't order it too often because it is on the pricier side. The overall taste was not too bad, but it wasn't as fresh or as vibrant as I've had at other locations. The rice beneath the salmon was a bit too hard, but the sauce and the salmon were tasty. This was one of the better dishes of the night.  Factory combination of 2 dishes: herb crusted salmon and the steak Diane along with mashed potatoes. This was not too bad, except that the herb crusted salmon paled in comparison to the miso salmon. Not as tasty, more dry, not as flavorful - the steak Diane was okay. I've been to a location where their steak Diane was horrible, so luckily the flavor was decent here. Nothing wowing about the two dishes, but I did like the mashed potatoes! This dish came out way later than the other two dishes, which was pretty sad considering we were almost done eating the other dishes.  Tomato Basil Pasta: not a bad pasta dish, although it could have used more sauce. Comes with chicken and fresh mozzarella along with penne pasta. It wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked - definitely lacking in salt, but nothing bad about the dish.  Cheesecakes:  Had to go with the fresh strawberry cheesecake since it's the most popular. And I can see why! The original topped with fresh glazed strawberries and a few dollops of whipped cream - very light and refreshing. The strawberries give a little tartness to the sweetness of the cheesecake, making you want to put another bite into your mouth after you've already inhaled one.  30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake cheesecake: this has layers of the original cheesecake, fudge cake, and chocolate truffle cream along with one dollop of whipped cream. This is very rich in chocolate taste, but not too overwhelming due to the layers of original cheesecake. I liked it! Very fudgy and definitely on the sweet side. I would reorder this again as well!  tl;dr - The biggest drawback was probably the poor service and the amount of time we had to wait for our food. Food seemed to be lacking, but the cheesecakes were good - thank goodness they can have consistent cheesecake. Don't think I'd return to this location if I was in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo,2.72,2.43,2.236,1.832,2.5460000000000003

This review summarizes my dinner I had two months ago to celebrate Valentines Day with my family. We came to have dinner on Saturday night, but we were told that the wait would be over an hour and a half long. We decided to wait until a bar seat was opened, no luck. So we waited about half an hour, early actually, to receive a table. The waiter was very nice and did her best to make sure that we were taken care of, but the long wait for food AND bread AND drinks didn't help her cause. For dinner, I had the Factory Burger, which has been one of my favorites. The overall taste was average, but it wasn't as delicious as it was in previous visits. The burger was on the dry side, but the special sauce gave it needed flavor. But I wasn't give my fries, and it finally caught the waiter's eye when she came to take my empty plate and saw my fries plate was missing. She was kind enough to give me an order of fries on the house, so props to her. For desert, I went with the fresh Vanilla bean cheesecake since I LOVE Vanilla. The Vanilla Cream with the texture of the pie crust plus the whipped cream - offered a delectable contrast. Overall, I was very happy with my desert. The food was good, but there's that one major problem that keeps overshadowing my experience here. That is the the poor service, the amount of time to get a table, and the amount of time we had to wait for our food. Honestly, I feel like the presentation and taste of the food keeps getting poorer and poorer with each visit, but the cheesecakes were good - which is one aspect of the dinner which I'm not complaining about.

The orders or Thai wraps had no depth of flavor. Definitely amateur hour there. We also ordered the jambalaya and shrimp pasta. The description sounded good.

My husband called them to order Louisiana chicken pasta and plain cheesecake, but they put him on hold for 10 minutes and the phone got disconnected. So he called back and he was on hold again for a few minutes until someone finally took his order and told him that it will be ready in 20-25 minutes.  After 20 minutes I went to pick up our order. Waited in line for 5 minutes while they were attending another customer whose order was incorrect. Finally, I gave them my name and order but they couldn't find it in their system. I don't know if it was the cashier or manager told me that this never happened to them I must have called the wrong place. Basically, they tried to put the blame on us for their mistake. Luckily my husband send me the screen shot of the call to hillsdale Cheesecake Factory. And she says, ""oh, that's weird maybe he didn't complete the order because it takes more than 5 minutes to place an order."" Are you kidding me!? We order only 2 items, why would it take more than 5 minutes to place a simple order!  Thus, I had to reorder my food. To make up for their mistake, which she didn't accept, she offered to give the cheesecake slice for free and said she will rush the order to 10 minutes. After 15 minutes I go to her asking about my order and she rudely tells me that ""well it's pasta, it takes time"" and walks away. After another 10 minutes they finally call my name  BUT it's only the pasta. When I asked that employee, he had no idea about the cheesecake slice so I had to reexplain the situation.  It really is not about the money. Was 6-$7 piece of cheesecake worth my time and frustration?  Lack of communication, disorganized management, and careless attitude of the female employee was shocking.

To be totally honest, my expectations were low, after all, it's considered a teflon, right? Three of us are seated fairly promptly, and we order lemon cheesecake, a lunch special small pizza and caesar salad, plus a Thai chicken curry over rice dish, which my husband and mother in law shared. First of all, the bread was remarkable: piping warm, crusty and soft (two types) with butter. The food was uniformly very good, the caesar sparkled, fresh and crisp romaine with a tangy dressing, which did not overwhelm (I did miss the anchovies, though maybe I should've asked for them). The pizza was more than decent, a crispy and blistered crust, blend of sausage and pepperoni, kalamata olives on request, a piquant tomato sauce. My husband scarfed down his rice dish and their tropical fresh brew iced tea for fantastic, fruity and not at all bitter without being cloyingly sweet. Here's my only negative: the cheesecake was disgusting--shocker, right? After all, they're named ""Cheesecake Factory!"" I'm chagrined to admit that after one teeny bite, I sent it back because no way was I gonna be able to eat it--it was inedible: the consistency was not light, airy, and fluffy; nor was it tangy and fresh lemony. Instead, it was a dense and artificially tasting, cream laden gunk of a bloby thing, gross . . . maybe the worst cake I've ever eaten. the food made up for it though. And here's the awesome part: every single person who served us was sweet, attentive, caring, warm, friendly, and super helpful! The guy who seated us offered to turn down the music, because it was blaringly loud for my aging ears. Our server was an incredibly kind young woman, who listened more than beyond the call of duty to my description of the cheesecake. As we were walking out, two different employees said goodbye in the sweetest and sincere way possible.

I have no idea, the person who was supposed to sit us down walked away with nobody and came back looking all confused as to why we were standing there.  Sat down at 6:50pm and the waiter didn't come to get our drink order until 7pm, which by that time, we were ready to order our food too. All we asked to drink was water but that took a whopping six mins. I guess it took awhile because the waiter was getting bread too? But it wasn't hot or anything so I'm not sure what the holdup was. While waiting for our food to come, our party of four finished the bread and asked for more. This time the bread was warm and took only three minutes! In addition to our bread, they were holding onto drinks and bread from other tables as well. Three minutes is pretty good, which makes me wonder why it took so long earlier.  Once our food came, we were just kinda left alone. This has its benefits and drawbacks. Benefits: we can focus on us and our food. Drawbacks: if we needed our waiter for anything it was hard to flag them down, especially when we were done eating and just sitting here waiting...  About the food: Personally I ordered the chicken Marsala with mushroom pasta. The chicken was well cooked and was not too chewy and soft. I really don't like to eat overcooked chicken that gets dry and chewy so I thoroughly enjoyed it. The pasta itself had enough sauce. A weird thing to note is that aside from the bow tie pasta that came with my food also had a decent amount of spaghetti. Now that we have waited so long for the waiter to come back, we are all pretty full so no dessert unfortunately. When she finally came around, we told her we were too full and asked for our boxes but she walked off too quickly before we can ask for the check but she came back pretty quickly with it.  Why did I rate this place 2 stars? Well beginning from 5 stars, -1 for inconsistency and confusion in waiting time at the front to be seated, -1 for inconsistent waiting time for water/bread, -1 for just sitting there waiting for the waiter to come back so we can get boxes and the check.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo,2.36,2.29,2.236,1.576,2.318

77,Allie Y.,"San Francisco, CA",521,327,658.0,2.0,2017-06-25,"Cheesecake factory is my favorite franchise restaurant. I've been to multiple locations and I've had the worst experience at this location so I will not be back to this location.  My party of 4 waited up to 1.5 hours. While we were waiting, we could see so many tables had no one seated and the tables just needed to be cleared. Where were all the bussers??  When we finally got seated and the waiter finally took our order, they didn't have chicken pot pie  or white rice left so we had to order other items on the menu. 20 mins in after we ordered, we still got no complimentary bread. From my previous experiences with Cheesecake factory, you never have to ask them for it and they just bring it to you. So we finally asked the waiter if we could have some. His response was ""Oh..I think we just ran out. Let me check!"" He came back 5 mins later with TWO small pieces for 4 of us. He said ""This is the last two pieces for real of the night."" The funny thing was, we saw on his serving tray there was another bread holder tray with 4 pieces and he served it to the table next to us with only 3 people in the party! My thought of that was because the table next to us was seated much later than us, and they had 3 people in their party only. However, he probably gave it to them since they ran out of most of the food they tried to order. (That table seemed really pissed too since he spent a good 5-10 mins just taking their order and the ran out of all the items they requested). So, the waiter was pretty good at lying. Our first dish we ordered came out 30 minutes after we ordered and each dish after that was another 10 mins after.

My friend and I went here today for a late lunch and let me tell you, it was the worst experience we've ever had at any Cheesecake Factory. Literally the second we sat down our server already came up to us, ""hi can I get you something to drink?"" Uhhh okay, water I guess? How are we supposed to know what we want to drink when we haven't even situated ourselves at our table? It's as if she was already standing around waiting for us to sit in her section then she immediately rushes us. Coming from a person who actually serves at another restaurant, we have ONE minute to greet our table. You can at least wait 45 seconds until we have sat down and actually opened the menu for you to greet us, no need to be in a hurry. Every time we've been to a Cheesecake Factory, the server always served bread immediately upon greeting. We had to ask her this time if we can have bread and we got the ""sure"" response. So that's cool too I guess... Food and drinks arrived pretty quickly which was a plus, and it was very tasty. The server tried to rush me again though by trying to take away my plate when I wasn't even finished with it. Kind of an uncomfortable experience, like my friend and I weren't even wanted there. Once we got the bill, we noticed that the server circled the tip examples at the bottom of the paper. Hahahaha are you kidding me? You really think we're that dumb to not know how to tip? Definitely undertipped this girl a lot for her shitty and rushed service, sorry not sorry. I'm not an idiot. Not to mention, she also grabbed the booklet before we even got up from our table to leave the restaurant. Never felt rushed before in my LIFE! We left the restaurant then unfortunately about 10 minutes later, my friend realized he left his phone at the table so we went back and asked whoever was at the host stand if they found a phone. We told him where we sat so he said he would go check on it. We saw him walk towards the kitchen, then to our table, then back to the kitchen, looking like he didn't know what he was doing. So my friend and I just checked the table ourselves and found the phone from there. More idiots that didn't want to help us. Great job!

In my experience here, if I asked the waitress or bartender for something specifically I've always gotten it. My friends haven't been as happy but that's the reason for my four stars. When you walk in the door you're seated immediately and the bar is nearly almost always open with seats if you just want appetizers. It's located right near the parking spots at the front of the mall, really convenient, really easy to get a quick (great) burger,  or appetizer, or, drink while watching the game at  the TV at the bar.  Four stars is only because my friends disagree with service,  but, they didn't ask for what they wanted, they just assumed. .... and after going with them and asking they now agree that the service is great.

She just had surgery and had gone through all sorts of health problems and her request on her birthday was to eat at Cheesecake Factory. I called and spoke to a manager whose name is Craig. I explained my situation about my mom and how I really wanted to make it extra special for her. He was super nice on the phone, he explained they didn't take reservations but that he was going to take care of my family when we got there. He was very accommodating assuring me that he will make this a great experience for us and to ask for him by name.  I didn't expect to have a red carpet treatment or anything, but I do expect a manager to abide by his word and not mislead me into thinking that he was going to accommodate my party of 10, but in all reality he was not going to. After hauling my family of 10, I was told we would have to wait 2 hours! I asked for Craig the manager and this lady wearing a yellow jacket said that I could not speak to him and he's busy. C'mon! Their number one priority should be customers especially unhappy ones! After insisting that I see this man for myself and for him to tell me to my face how he was dishonest on the phone, the mysteriousCraig finally made an appearance.  I spoke to him and he just kept twisting his words. Saying I didn't say this and that and how you're gonna have to wait like everyone else it. (Which would have been fine if he didn't tell me on the phone to ask for him by name and assured me that he would make my mom's birthday a very special one.) It is completely dishonest, misleading and rude of a manager to say I will take care of your party upon arrival and then say, ""Actually never mind, I never said that."" Terrible customer service.

I could only taste the strong oil in every bite I took and I'm not sure if there was any taste to the shrimp or the sauce that the dish was served with. All of this was after they took 40 mins to serve the appetizer on a not so busy Thursday night.  We should have ideally left after this with our takeaway order of cheesecakes but we took a chance and ordered the Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta.

It used to be a great place with great food but the past year or so the service and overall quality of the food have been horrible. I use to eat here once or twice a month, not anymore. The last time I ordered food, they forgot to input my order, and I had to wait an hour for them to remake my order. I decided to give San Mateo Cheesecake, one more shot but sadly I was disappointed again. I was on hold for over 20 minutes, once I finally spoke with Dori. I expressed that I was very unhappy with the wait and she gave me some BS response that she was busy.  When I arrived at the restaurant to pick up my food, she wasn't busy at all, she was standing at the register doing nothing. I don't know if they have new management or what, but whoever's in charge of this restaurant needs to be fired.

After I paid, he proceeded to help the next customer. I had to ask again and where he then asked someone that get it. I asked for my cheesecake that I ordered and he said it's coming. He proceeded to two more customers and then just pulled a slice from the refrigerator behind him and put it on a bag and gave it to me. If that's all he needed to do then why didn't he do that in the first place. No reason for me to wait for three customers to order.

We were seated right away, and I tried: -Korean Fried Cauliflower ($5.95): This is still a great appetizer, and the flavors are really good. The cauliflower was also nice and crispy- highly recommended! -Dynamite Shrimp (Crispy Tempura Shrimp w/Spicy Dynamite Sauce, $7.95,  ): Not that great- the batter on the shrimp was too thick, and the dynamite sauce wasn't spicy and didn't have much flavor. Skip! -Crispy Chicken Costoletta (Chicken Breast Lightly Breaded & Sauteed to a Crisp Golden Brown, Served w/Lemon Sauce, Mashed Potatoes, Fresh Asparagus, $17.95,  ): Just ok- they give you a giant plate of chicken (3 pieces) and mound of mashed potatoes, but the sauce was really bland. There was a nice crisp on the chicken, and that was pretty flavorful. However, the mashed potatoes could have also used additional flavor. I probably wouldn't get this dish again. -Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cheesecake ( ): Way too sweet, and the walnuts were weird in here. I also didn't like the combination of flavors with the cookie dough and cheesecake- skip! Our server was actually competent this time around, and our food came out quickly, which was great!

He most likely informed our waitress, Champagne, who came  5 minutes later, with the kid's menu, the french fries and the salmon. My filet mignon was not ready. How long does it really take to sizzle a filet mignon? unless they completely forgot my order.  Now.. The food. I asked a filet mignon, supposed to be very tender, medium rare. It arrived burned, hard, and more like between medium rare and well-done. This is really the worst filet mignon of my life. An insult to the French cuisine. I'm sure that Mc Donalds can cook a better medium rare filet mignon if they could do it. What about the french fries? Too salty and cold. I complained to the waitress about the wait and she gave us an attitude, like she could care less. Once I was done with my filet mignon, here comes the check and the waitress was eager to see us leave.

45,Joey Z.,"San Francisco, CA",0,7,4.0,1.0,2017-11-19,"Cheesecake Factory is well known for their awesome desserts although a little pricey, it's worth it. But my memory of the Restaurant at the Hillsdale Mall in San Mateo CA should be a wake up for management to create a plan of action when things get hectic. I was waiting at the to-go counter to get a slice, maybe two of my favorite cheesecakes. The young man behind the counter seemed to have several technical difficulties at the cash register. Therefore catering to one customer for over 30 minutes. Meanwhile the line started to grow. And since the crowd would not fit the welcoming area, the one line became two or three. I also noticed an older couple claiming to be in front of me but I know for sure the husband wasn't. I asked the person at the front desk if that was the only cash register that took take out orders and she said that that was it. Um....where is management's plan B on this? Why are they allowing customers to get impatient so as to verbally abuse their employees? Oh yeah there was one who was in a dress shirt and tie who tried to assist our poor young man behind the takeout counter with the technical difficulty but left him again and again by himself unresolved resulting for that young man to run across the restaurant a few times, talk about safety issues. SO - I just left and told the person at the front that that poor employee had to cater to one customer for over 30 minutes. I had to leave before I would have said something I might regret - Lesson here is: Stay  away from the Cheesecake Factory from Hillsdale Mall in San Mateo during peak hours because management seem to not have the skill to train their employees what to do to ease crowd control",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=40,2.32,2.12,2.224,,2.2

It took around 25 min to get seated, 30 min to get our food, and another 15 minutes to order and receive our cheesecake. Luckily we had plenty of freshly baked sourdough and wheat bread to tide us over. I absolutely love their honey wheat brown bread - it's sweet, crusty, and hearty.  Cheesecake Factory has a huge menu, and there are a decent number of vegetarian options. I've always enjoyed their veggie burger - the housemade patty is a well-seasoned blend of grains and veggies. This time I wanted to try something different and went with the super antioxidant salad. The toppings were all delicious, especially the roasted broccoli, but they really skimped out. I received a giant bowl of salad greens with very few toppings, which is unacceptable for the price ($11.49). Perhaps I'll have better luck trying out one of their vegetarian pasta dishes next time. Let's be honest though, I totally came to Cheesecake Factory for the cheesecake and not the entrees. In particular I've been waiting to try the Celebration Cheesecake and it did not disappoint!! It had so many different layers: funfetti cake, cheesecake, strawberry/chocolate/vanilla mousse, and cream cheese frosting. It reminded me of Baked Alaska but even more decadent. I'm a sucker for anything funfetti, so the Celebration Cheesecake easily became my favorite.

The first thing was I asked for a table for 5 and they wrote me down for a table for 2 and we ended up having to wait longer for an available table. They tried to scramble up a small table that could not seat any of us comfortably so we had to wait even longer for them to actually accommodate us with an adequately sized table. While we were waiting I overheard a hostess asking a customer for their number, I misinterpreted the conversation and thought they had a texting system that would let you know when your table was ready. However, when I asked if I could put my number down for texting updates, the hostess rudely cut me off and said that wasn't an option and proceeded to sarcastically me and explain what texting systems are and she doesn't have the capability to ""text every single person who is waiting for a table"". I then explained that I had heard her ask another woman for her number and thought that she was putting her number down so she could get text updates. The hostess kept cutting me off and looking at me crazy and didn't help me understand the context of that conversation. So, annoyed, i left to wait for my table...just to hear her give ANOTHER Customer the option to put their number down so they can get called when their table was ready....literally all i wanted was the option to be contacted when my table was ready. Whether or not it was a phone call or text the host knew what I was asking for because I asked her how if I could walk around the mall for a little while I was waiting and not miss my table being called.  Now fast forward to the meal, my sister ordered calamari and after about a 25-30 minutes everyone's meals were served except for the calamari. It took us another 10 minutes to catch the attention of a server who then told us that it was ""unservable"" but for 40 minutes never told us. On top of that I ordered a spicy chicken pasta and it was extremely sweet and so I had to send it back and our waitress walked past our table multiple times without coming to retake my sisters order or mine. We had to walk up and ask her to come back. We ended up asking to get the orders to go but they still served the meals on plates so we had to wait again as they put our meals in to go boxes.

Neil is awesome and truly exemplifies the meaning of hospitality in every way shape and form. I also told him inside at the counter that no matter how old a woman gets she still likes being called Miss as opposed to Ma'am and he began calling me Miss and corrected himself everytime he almost said Ma'am.  It's people like him that make me want to go back to cheesecake and explore the menu until I find something I love on the menu. Outstanding service and warm hospitality sometimes mean more than the food itself and even make it taste better.  Neil deserves a promotion and would make a great Manager with his natural warmth and genuine care he clearly exhibits.

17,Samantha A.,"Redwood City, CA",188,7,1.0,1.0,2018-01-03,"I have always gone to the one in downtown Palo Alto and always been satisfied. First time at this location and I haven't left a restaurant so upset before. Ordered appitizers we never got, pasta came out cold and chicken was still pink in my sandwhich and our waiter would Barely come out to see how we wer doing or how the food was. He practically forgot about us and we had to ask the host for assistance. When we asked for our check he was rude and I will never be coming here again. Very disappointed",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo,2.84,2.32,2.272,,2.528
1,Arleen L.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,5,,1.0,2018-01-05,"Was here for dinner on a Monday night with a party of 11.  Had to wait an hour as CCF does not takereservations. For appetizers, we ordered some zucchini sticks n fried calamari. When people began to munch on the calamari we realized some pieces were actually fried chicken. We brought it to the waitress' attention and she just chuckled and said ""You got both. Don't know what the cooks are doing"" and off she went.  As dinner plates were being served, the waitress informed J there was no bread for her avocado toast so she needed to order something else. No bread?? Really??? ‍‍It gets worse. After everyone else aside from J got there orders placed in front of them, H was informed by the waitress that his fish tacos were made wrong  as they were beef so she chose not to bring it over. Poor H had to watch us all eat while his tacos were being made. Waitress did not apologize or offer to comp the tacos or offer at slice of cheesecake.  Sorry to say the CCF has gone down in quality and service. I will not be returning again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo,2.68,2.29,2.272,,2.446
61,Laura P.,"San Mateo, CA",0,2,,1.0,2018-01-08,"As a party of six we arrived at noon on Sunday.  We had two six  year old little boys.   We waited approximately 15 minutes to be seated, which was fine.  We sat and waited for the server to take our drink order.  Half of the order was brought to us.  As we waited, and waited, we were told they could bring half of our order??? WHAT?? No, came together and wanted to EAT together!   We were told that the Thai spring rolls was holding up our order...not a cooked meal...just salad components on a plate!   One of the boys wanted another glass of milk and we were told up front that we would be charged for another glass...no free refills. Well, if we had our meal served on time, we would not have to order another milk to drink with his meal. So, finally at 1:30pm...one by one...our meals arrived! One and a half hour after arriving at the restaurant.  Just happy we didn't go for dinner!  We would have left at midnight!   We had to ask for a refill for the tea pot, sugar for coffee and dressing for the salad.  And we had to wait for those items.  The salad dressing came to late as we were about to leave! We were NEVER asked if we wanted to see the dessert menu. So, so disappointed for our New Year family celebration.   Guess we won't be visiting again for a celebration.  :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=20,2.68,2.28,2.272,,2.44

I love the bread here & she even gave me more bread so I can take some home. We asked a bunch of questions about the menu & she was honest about which dishes she liked or which weren't that great. We were also her last table but we didn't feel rushed or anything.  ALSO! My friend thought one of the servers were cute & she was like ""I could talk to him for you!"" She's a server & cupid haha!  She made the experience so awesome. She has a very happy & friendly personality, very easy to talk to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo,2.84,2.31,2.284,,2.5220000000000002

6,Tonika J.,"Hayward, CA",6,3,1.0,1.0,2018-01-11,"This location is very in efficient when it comes to placing a to go order. Called 3 times and Waited on hold a total of 25 min and still didn't get anyone to take my order. It's bad enough the wait times can be a bit long, but who has time to wait on hold to place a to go order. The hostess that answered the phone told me she was going to get someone to take my order and I waited 10 mins and she never came back to the phone. I hung up and will go somewhere else to pick up my dinner, since they are unable to handle to go order properly",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo,2.76,2.35,2.288,,2.5140000000000002
5,Mrs. B.,"Riverside, CA",21,116,86.0,1.0,2018-01-13,Unprofessional they suck. Came in folks were behind me asking for tables while I'm standing at the counter no paging device issued no help given these people are unprofessional holding conversations at the counter. I watched the staff give new customers who walked in a pager while I'm sitting here without one. I walk up and was told we don't have anymore hmmmm interesting I just saw you give out THREE oh I don't know I guess you have to wait the other ones are broken. It's unfortunate because my friend wants to eat here smh  ready to go I rather have wing stop or McDonald's hell even a hot dog,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo,2.6,2.33,2.284,,2.438
