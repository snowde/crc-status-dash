1711,Kevin Q.,"San Jose, United States",364,72,39.0,4.0,2012-01-03,"I've been to this Cheesecake Factory a multiple of times. Every visit was pretty decent. There is nothing bad about this place, but also nothing super amazing, except the cheesecakes of course! On the weekends this place is usually packed, but any other day it's pretty empty. The service here is decent, the atmosphere is great, and the food, well it can be a hit or miss sometimes. First I would just like to make a comment on the cost of the food, yes it is pretty pricey if you think about it. 16-20 dollars for pasta? But then again the portions are huge! The portions are slightly larger then BJ's if you have ever been there. A entree of pasta could easily feed two people(depending on the person you share with of course). Also the pasta here isn't too bad. At times the pasta can be full of flavor and at other times it could be bland. The dishes I had with my group was the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, Pasta Da Vinci, and Steak Diane. To start off the meal of course we had fried calamari and artichoke dip. Let's just say, I had better fried calamari at many other places. The calamari here was a bit bland and sometimes a bit too soggy. The artichoke dip here is very decent. In my opinion it doesn't match up with Red Robins or Chili's artichoke dip as they have better chips and more flavor in the dip itself. The Cajun Jambalaya Pasta on the other hand was pretty good. It had a small kick to it with a lot of flavors, and also the portion was huge. My friend couldn't finish it, so we all had to help him finish. On the side note though, I had this entree multiple times, and it could be pretty bland sometimes with no taste, besides the taste of pepper. The Pasta Da Vinci on the other hand was amazing. It was my first time getting it. The sauce had a unique flavor of onions and mushrooms. The only way I can describe it is like eating pasta with the In N Out thousand island sauce. I know it doesn't sound appealing but it was very delicious. It wasn'",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=940,3.52,3.61,3.552,3.152,3.5740000000000003

927,Mary L.,"Milpitas, CA",198,40,3.0,4.0,2012-01-05,"Food is great. The portions are kind of large so you can probably share one dish between two people, especially for the pasta. I've been there many times and service was great, but once I had a really rude server.  My friends and I tried to catch his attention by giving him eye contact and raising our hands to ask for some dressing and to order some dessert. He saw us but ignored us and continued to assist his other tables and next to us. As my friend kindly called him over by saying ""excuse me,"" he yelled at her and told her she was being rude when he was coming over to the table next to us. We were done with our food for about ten minutes and then he asked us if we wanted the bill. We decided to pay for the bill and go elsewhere for dessert.  We didn't do anything to anger him at all and we still had terrible service.

640,Mikey T.,"Anaheim, CA",211,49,4.0,2.0,2012-01-06,"Last year, after finding out how unhealthy it is, I vowed never to eat at another Cheesecake Factory again. Yesterday, I broke that vow. Okay, seriously: I'm not the most health-conscious person, and a couple times a week I'll find myself eating out and indulging in a fat burger or some lobster or something, but Cheesecake Factory is downright deadly. I decided to look up the nutrition facts of their menu one day - BIG mistake. A good 2/3rds of the menu contains an ungodly amount of calories and saturated fat, more than any person should eat in one sitting. That said, I was with a friend and we were both extremely fatigued from a long day of shopping and walking, and we also both had CF gift cards, so we decided to settle. Our food, however, did not. Even as I'm sitting here on my bed, typing away on my laptop, a good 11 hours after eating, I still feel it sitting there in my stomach, slowly clogging my arteries. I feel fat just typing this review. And it's not only the healthiness (or lack thereof) of the food that left a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended), it's also...well, the bad taste. I ordered the Pasta Da Vinci; sounds refined, right? Not exactly. The pasta was undercooked, I only received a few skimpy pieces of dry chicken, and the entire dish was lathered with more sauce than it needed. It felt like I was eating a slightly-upscale version of a microwave dinner.  I will say this: the brown bread that they have is absolutely DELICIOUS. And it's not bad for your health, either...well, because it's just bread. As far as this particular location goes, there's ample seating (boothes, tables, high-chairs and a bar area) and the staff is courteous and highly attentive, checking in with us to make sure that we had everything that we needed. This was a pleasant surprise for me; being a young adult, I find that many times, servers do not pay as much attention to me as they do to older customers. Although I certainly don't need any extra attention, its always a nice gesture to receive some. Hey - just because I'm young doesn't mean I don't know how to give a tip when I feel that it is deserved (and I did tip, generously, in this case).  All ranting aside, if it weren't for the outstanding customer service, that scrumptious brown bread, and the good company that I was with, I probably wouldn't have enjoyed this night as much as I did.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=980,3.76,3.63,3.548,2.8240000000000003,3.682

625,Kevin Q.,"San Jose, CA",364,72,39.0,4.0,2012-03-01,"I've been to this Cheesecake Factory a multiple of times. Every visit was pretty decent. There is nothing bad about this place, but also nothing super amazing, except the cheesecakes of course! On the weekends this place is usually packed, but any other day it's pretty empty. The service here is decent, the atmosphere is great, and the food, well it can be a hit or miss sometimes. First I would just like to make a comment on the cost of the food, yes it is pretty pricey if you think about it. 16-20 dollars for pasta? But then again the portions are huge! The portions are slightly larger then BJ's if you have ever been there. A entree of pasta could easily feed two people(depending on the person you share with of course). Also the pasta here isn't too bad. At times the pasta can be full of flavor and at other times it could be bland. The dishes I had with my group was the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, Pasta Da Vinci, and Steak Diane. To start off the meal of course we had fried calamari and artichoke dip. Let's just say, I had better fried calamari at many other places. The calamari here was a bit bland and sometimes a bit too soggy. The artichoke dip here is very decent. In my opinion it doesn't match up with Red Robins or Chili's artichoke dip as they have better chips and more flavor in the dip itself. The Cajun Jambalaya Pasta on the other hand was pretty good. It had a small kick to it with a lot of flavors, and also the portion was huge. My friend couldn't finish it, so we all had to help him finish. On the side note though, I had this entree multiple times, and it could be pretty bland sometimes with no taste, besides the taste of pepper. The Pasta Da Vinci on the other hand was amazing. It was my first time getting it. The sauce had a unique flavor of onions and mushrooms. The only way I can describe it is like eating pasta with the In N Out thousand island sauce. I know it doesn't sound appealing but it was very delicious. It wasn'",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=940,3.64,3.56,3.556,2.9920000000000004,3.5920000000000005

1650,Leslie H.,"Cupertino, United States",407,923,214.0,3.0,2012-04-22,"What should I expect? Well, an hour long wait for one thing. Actually, that's not too bad considering it was a Saturday evening, and we showed up around 6:15. I took a seat and settled in for some prime people watching. It seems like Cheesecake Factory appeals to all sorts of demographics. We saw ""Girls Night Out"" crews, families, prom goers, teenagers on group dates, pretty much everything. When you check in, the hostess gives you a pager and a time estimate, but don't stray too far because the pager only has a 30 foot range. I was told 45-50 minutes for the wait and given a pager with a detached capacitor. I wasn't fully convinced that it would buzz, so I just waited for my name to be called.  The Cheesecake Factory has a smart business model. Make people wait so they get hungry and then give them a massive menu with a huge number of choices. I'm not sure why a typical pasta dish costs upwards of $15, but their portion sizes sure are huge. I've really enjoyed their chicken Madeira and chicken Marsala as well as their various pasta dishes in the past, but I just can't bring myself to shell out so much anymore, so I usually go with their crispy chicken sandwich. It's a chicken breast that's battered and fried, then topped with a slice of cheese, a slice of cheese, one measly slice of tomato, and a bunch of shredded lettuce. You'd think a place like The Cheesecake Factory that would charge $12 for a sandwich could at least use whole pieces of lettuce, but no. It doesn't even come with onion or a pickle! But it's still one of the cheaper items on the menu. It also comes with fries. I used to really enjoy their shoestring fries, but they seemed to have switched to thicker cut ones. One thing I will give them is that their chipotle mayo and their ranch dressing are darn tasty. I did greatly enjoy our white chocolate blueberry cheesecake yesterday, but I did also balk at the $6.95 price tag. Oh well, you kind of get what you expect and are willing to pay for when you come to The Cheesecake Factory.

744,Leslie H.,"Cupertino, CA",407,923,214.0,3.0,2012-04-22,"What should I expect? Well, an hour long wait for one thing. Actually, that's not too bad considering it was a Saturday evening, and we showed up around 6:15. I took a seat and settled in for some prime people watching. It seems like Cheesecake Factory appeals to all sorts of demographics. We saw ""Girls Night Out"" crews, families, prom goers, teenagers on group dates, pretty much everything. When you check in, the hostess gives you a pager and a time estimate, but don't stray too far because the pager only has a 30 foot range. I was told 45-50 minutes for the wait and given a pager with a detached capacitor. I wasn't fully convinced that it would buzz, so I just waited for my name to be called.  The Cheesecake Factory has a smart business model. Make people wait so they get hungry and then give them a massive menu with a huge number of choices. I'm not sure why a typical pasta dish costs upwards of $15, but their portion sizes sure are huge. I've really enjoyed their chicken Madeira and chicken Marsala as well as their various pasta dishes in the past, but I just can't bring myself to shell out so much anymore, so I usually go with their crispy chicken sandwich. It's a chicken breast that's battered and fried, then topped with a slice of cheese, a slice of cheese, one measly slice of tomato, and a bunch of shredded lettuce.

I think everything accounts to appetite, how you eat in your house is also your attitude when you eat out.

Loved it! 3: sweet corn tamale with toppings on the side - for me little bubba, toppings consists of salsa, sour cream and avocado chunks - he doesn't care for the sour cream and salsa but loved the avocado chunks with his sweet corn tamales! 4: small plates fried artichoke hearts - it was perfect! Delicious crunchy on the outside and healthy on the inside! Yummy goodness! 5: Classic fresh strawberry cheesecake to share - it really doesn't get better than that!

1766,Mikey T.,"Anaheim, United States",211,49,4.0,2.0,2012-06-01,"Last year, after finding out how unhealthy it is, I vowed never to eat at another Cheesecake Factory again. Yesterday, I broke that vow. Okay, seriously: I'm not the most health-conscious person, and a couple times a week I'll find myself eating out and indulging in a fat burger or some lobster or something, but Cheesecake Factory is downright deadly. I decided to look up the nutrition facts of their menu one day - BIG mistake. A good 2/3rds of the menu contains an ungodly amount of calories and saturated fat, more than any person should eat in one sitting. That said, I was with a friend and we were both extremely fatigued from a long day of shopping and walking, and we also both had CF gift cards, so we decided to settle. Our food, however, did not. Even as I'm sitting here on my bed, typing away on my laptop, a good 11 hours after eating, I still feel it sitting there in my stomach, slowly clogging my arteries. I feel fat just typing this review. And it's not only the healthiness (or lack thereof) of the food that left a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended), it's also...well, the bad taste. I ordered the Pasta Da Vinci; sounds refined, right? Not exactly. The pasta was undercooked, I only received a few skimpy pieces of dry chicken, and the entire dish was lathered with more sauce than it needed. It felt like I was eating a slightly-upscale version of a microwave dinner.  I will say this: the brown bread that they have is absolutely DELICIOUS. And it's not bad for your health, either...well, because it's just bread. As far as this particular location goes, there's ample seating (boothes, tables, high-chairs and a bar area) and the staff is courteous and highly attentive, checking in with us to make sure that we had everything that we needed. This was a pleasant surprise for me; being a young adult, I find that many times, servers do not pay as much attention to me as they do to older customers. Although I certainly don't need any extra attention, its always a nice gesture to receive some. Hey - just because I'm young doesn't mean I don't know how to give a tip when I feel that it is deserved (and I did tip, generously, in this case).  All ranting aside, if it weren't for the outstanding customer service, that scrumptious brown bread, and the good company that I was with, I probably wouldn't have enjoyed this night as much as I did.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=980,3.52,3.54,3.5,2.7280000000000006,3.5320000000000005

1132,Yuyu Z.,"San Jose, CA",63,22,10.0,4.0,2012-06-10,"I love Cheesecake Factory, probably one of my favorite restaurant. The food is super yummy. I recommend Chicken Bellagio, Chicken Picata, and as appetizer the Buffalo blast. Their food is a bit pricey but the portion is well worth the price. I always attempt to save room for cheesecake as dessert but it never happens. I think they have great waitress and waiters every now and then you get one that's not great but usually I love my waiter/waitress. One of my favorite sides to get there as not yummy as it sounds is a side of fries with ranch. They have THEEE best fries and THEEE best ranch. And trust me, I've eaten a lot of different fries and ranch before. Their complementary bread is also super yum! The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it's ALWAYS busy. Sometime the wait is not that long but sometime you could be waiting for HOURS. Sometimes they accept reservations sometimes they don't. The restaurant itself is beautiful, take a moment to take in the setting. Then look up around the ceiling and pillars its actually really pretty. The lighting is pretty darn romantic at night, I'd say it's a great place to have a nice romantic dinner. What more can I say?

I love their pastas! If I want something ""healthy"" I'd get the Evelyn's favorite pasta. Their farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic is also very good. Their portions are generous so you do pay for what you get. Also, you can never go wrong with the spicy chicken chipotle pasta, but I would suggest not to force yourself to finish it all since the spiciness can get to you if you are a weak spice eater like me. :P  I have also gotten their crispy artichoke hearts under their small plates selections, it was just okay. Their vietnamese tacos were surprisingly delicious. Their buffalo wings with lots of blue cheese are really good because they are crispy and the meat is very soft. Their fried mac n cheese come in 4 balls, they're fried so of course, they are not good for your cholesterol levels. One bite into them, the creamy mac and cheese just melts in your mouth. Eating 2 balls is plenty because it does get filling.  Lastly, you can't forget their cheesecake. The ultimate red velvet cake cheesecake is OMG good! I always love to take this to-go because by the time I am done with my entree, I am stuffed so I won't get to enjoy the cheesecake.

Their vietnamese tacos were surprisingly delicious. Their buffalo wings with lots of blue cheese are really good because they are crispy and the meat is very soft. Their fried mac n cheese come in 4 balls, they're fried so of course, they are not good for your cholesterol levels. One bite into them, the creamy mac and cheese just melts in your mouth. Eating 2 balls is plenty because it does get filling.  Lastly, you can't forget their cheesecake. The ultimate red velvet cake cheesecake is OMG good!

Cheesecake factory couldn't afford to give even a tiny piece of dessert in that tiny shot glass? If it was free, then I would've just been mildly annoyed. But after we left, my friend told me that they charged us $9 for that shot of whipped cream -____- Besides that issue, the rest of the experience was okay. The wait for a table was pretty long since we had a large group. Service was average. I ordered the Miso Salmon with brown rice since the birthday girl recommended it.

Jesse was the relief we needed after our past server was seen in the back chatting with fellow workers when I needed to follow up on my order when it was his fault in the first place for not getting it right (I had asked the waiter for a macaroni and cheese burger and then he asks me what kind of burger I wanted?? I thought he meant there were choices in patty so I said I didn't know and he wrote down classic. Umm hello?! Mac & cheese please! Plus I said I wanted the Caesar salad instead of fries and he asks ""with fries?"" DUDE! What planet are you living on?!?!) Enough with the nameless waiter I didn't bother getting the name of!   Jesse goes above and beyond! He always anticipates our needs right before we ask! Our waters were consistently filled, we were given more bread without complaints, he asked about boxes for leftovers, and didn't even ask for the 50% cheesecake Facebook print out a few months ago-- he just glanced at them AND knew which cheesecakes to deduct from (ordered cheesecake to go also).

Each bite is filled with creamy cheesecake and chunks of caramel, peanuts, nougat, and of course chocolate!  -Adam's peanut butter fudge ripple: the favorite of one of my best friend's (she's in love with peanut butter) peanut butter cups, fudge, chocolate, nuts, peanut butter topping that's seriously too sweet but this cheesecake has got it going on!   I've also tried the one with macadamias/caramel/white chocolate and the caramel pecan turtle-- they're alright. I'm not a big fan of caramel IN my desserts. Maybe on it is fine.  -Chocolate chip cookie dough: simple and sweet, reminds me of the days we ate cookie dough straight from the package, or was that last week ... One waiter I must compliment is Jesse J. He strives to be the best without even breaking a sweat-- it's all natural to him. My friend and I had him twice, and good thing we did because the first time he took over for another waiter that really shouldn't have been working when it was obvious he didn't care much for the customers. Jesse was the relief we needed after our past server was seen in the back chatting with fellow workers when I needed to follow up on my order when it was his fault in the first place for not getting it right (I had asked the waiter for a macaroni and cheese burger and then he asks me what kind of burger I wanted?? I thought he meant there were choices in patty so I said I didn't know and he wrote down classic. Umm hello?! Mac & cheese please! Plus I said I wanted the Caesar salad instead of fries and he asks ""with fries?"" DUDE! What planet are you living on?!?!) Enough with the nameless waiter I didn't bother getting the name of!   Jesse goes above and beyond! He always anticipates our needs right before we ask! Our waters were consistently filled, we were given more bread without complaints, he asked about boxes for leftovers, and didn't even ask for the 50% cheesecake Facebook print out a few months ago-- he just glanced at them AND knew which cheesecakes to deduct from (ordered cheesecake to go also). Some servers use the discount on the cheapest item on the bill but ours didn't and I'm happy for that. Businesses should have more employees like this-- we're sure to come back because of people like him.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=600,3.6,3.47,3.464,3.508,3.5220000000000002

483,Alexander E.,"San Pablo, CA",355,636,830.0,4.0,2013-01-04,"It's pretty hard to resist The Cheesecake Factory. Who doesn't like to over indulge in classic American dishes? Followed with a 1,200 calorie dessert. It was Game 3 of the World Series and the Giants were out of town. We decided to visit The Cheesecake Factory and watch the game and get a bite to eat before heading over to the Winchester Mansion. The wait was surprisingly short, roughly 15 minutes or so on a Saturday afternoon.  The Cheesecake Factory menu is no piece of pie. That baby has about 12 pages of 2 person dishes, yet I had an idea of what I wanted to go with: Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich. It's never let me down, but once I looked at its nutrition content, I reconsidered. After poring over the menu, I finally decided on going with two items from the SkinnyLicious menu: Chicken Lettuce Wrap Tacos (Mexican); and Flatbread Pizza (Margherita).  The wrap tacos came out and were much bigger than I expected. A trio of butter lettuce leaves filed with chicken and stuffed with avocado, tomato, onion, cilantro, roasted corn salsa, and crema. The tacos were a great choice but my only complaint were that they were difficult to handle. Additionally, one of the leaves was already ripped, which made everything fall out immediately. If you have trouble handling the tacos, you can easily make it into a small salad. As tasty as the tacos were, the flatbread pizza was even better. The portion was generous and larger than I expected. The crust was crispy without being burnt and the mozzarella, tomato, and basil all made for a freshly made (healthy) pizza.  Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with The Cheesecake Factory. The bar was a little busier than usual because of the World Series game, but other than that, it was pretty straight forward on getting a table; our waitress was friendly and gave great service, and the food was great. I would have loved getting my typical Crispy Chicken Sandwich, but I was in no position to break the calorie bank. If you're looking to eat healthy at The Cheesecake Factory, I suggest exploring the SkinnyLicious menu, as the two items I had were delicious, and there's even alcoholic drinks on the menu.,  Ambiance: 4 Stars (out of 5) Food: 4 Stars (out of 5) Service: 4 Stars (out of 5) Price: $$ Overall: 4 Stars (out of 5) Pros: + THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY + Large menu + New SkinnyLicious menu + Portions + Value + Location Cons: - Crowded at times",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=580,3.84,3.61,3.524,2.8000000000000003,3.702

Dirty dishes were also a problem. Luckily, they started a shift change while I was eating. Everything changed for the better.

Followed with a 1,200 calorie dessert. It was Game 3 of the World Series and the Giants were out of town. We decided to visit The Cheesecake Factory and watch the game and get a bite to eat before heading over to the Winchester Mansion. The wait was surprisingly short, roughly 15 minutes or so on a Saturday afternoon.  The Cheesecake Factory menu is no piece of pie. That baby has about 12 pages of 2 person dishes, yet I had an idea of what I wanted to go with: Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich. It's never let me down, but once I looked at its nutrition content, I reconsidered. After poring over the menu, I finally decided on going with two items from the SkinnyLicious menu: Chicken Lettuce Wrap Tacos (Mexican); and Flatbread Pizza (Margherita).  The wrap tacos came out and were much bigger than I expected. A trio of butter lettuce leaves filed with chicken and stuffed with avocado, tomato, onion, cilantro, roasted corn salsa, and crema. The tacos were a great choice but my only complaint were that they were difficult to handle. Additionally, one of the leaves was already ripped, which made everything fall out immediately. If you have trouble handling the tacos, you can easily make it into a small salad. As tasty as the tacos were, the flatbread pizza was even better. The portion was generous and larger than I expected. The crust was crispy without being burnt and the mozzarella, tomato, and basil all made for a freshly made (healthy) pizza.  Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with The Cheesecake Factory. The bar was a little busier than usual because of the World Series game, but other than that, it was pretty straight forward on getting a table; our waitress was friendly and gave great service, and the food was great. I would have loved getting my typical Crispy Chicken Sandwich, but I was in no position to break the calorie bank.

The food is very fresh, flavorful and beautifully plated. Portions are extremely generous too. I love their Chicken Madeira and the Herb-crusted Salmon. Mashed potatoes are delicious. When the bread is fresh and hot, it's also great. The few times where something was not up to par, the wait staff is usually very nice and good about fixing it.

586,Kevin D.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,15,2.0,2.0,2013-04-07,"It was our first time at The Cheesecake Factory. And to start off with good: The decor is really nice! Probably too nice for the low-quality food and service, so maybe it set my expectations too high. This is a great place for cheap kids food, although my kid's cheese pizza tasted like soap. Life advice: Please do not get the fettuccine with chicken and sun-dried tomatoes, unless you enjoy tough chicken, Chef Boyardee sauce, and bland pasta. When our server asked how it was, I said, ""Not great, it's..."" but then she walked away. I wanted to order something else, so I waited for the server to come back. They didn't. I asked another server if they could get ours, and they said sure! And 10 minutes later, no one. So I went in back to ask for help, they said they'd be right over -- and still didn't! And another 10 minutes went by -- so I went back again! And like a bad joke, they said they'd be right over, and believe it or not, they still did not show up. They did offer to reduce our bill, but I didn't want that. I just wanted to know how we'd become invisible, and I really wanted to eat something besides the bread and my kid's soap pizza. I think I've been spoiled by good restaurants. To be fair, if you like food at Chili's or Applebee's, you'll probably like this.

The dish is a must-try, It's hard to get things at this place because its either not good or all the good dishes are cheesy and creamy which I can't eat (I get sick) and it doesn't taste great for me. ---- Service: the waiter was super nice. Wait: Terrible as always, not as bad for tonight, pretty shorter than experienced before.. The only deal with this chain is how they won't split bills.

Yeah the food portions are huge and it is like a fancier Applebee's or something. I've been here a couple times for dinner and the prices are around $15 for plates. The portions are pretty big so you will probably have leftovers. A negative is that the wait is around 45 minutes My review will be based off of their famous desserts! There are soooo many delicious slices of cheesecake/cake to choose from and it was just so hard to choose one. I ended up making a great decision and got the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple cake. MY GOODNESS. EVERYTHING YOU WANT AND MORE. Peanut butter, chocolate and I even found a piece of butterfinger on the bottom. It is VERY rich and thick so I only finished half and saved the other half for the next day. In my head I thought, it is just one cheesecake, how bad can it be? I looked up the calorie count online and I almost fainted at how ridiculous it is. IT IS 1300 calories!!!! hahaha I LOLed when I saw this but it was sooo worth it.  Overall, the entrees are alright and the dessert is bomb. **TIPS** 1) Watch those calories when you choose a dessert. It will go straight to your hips. Definitely share a slice! 2) Walk around the mall while you wait so your long wait time will pass. 3) Enjoy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=400,3.44,3.48,3.48,2.38,3.4640000000000004

I mean it's so bad for you, but yet so good.  This time around I wasn't as hungry as I anticipated so I ordered the ahi carpaccio under the appetizers. It was very soft and had a smooth texture. I wish I had soy sauce and wasabi though, I didn't bother to ask since it was so busy.  Unfortunately, I didn't get our server's name but she was a Hispanic lady. She was very attentive and refilled our drinks without question. Good service and good food.

Expected: A ridiculous wait.  Arrived at 8:02pm and was told it would be 40 minutes. Unexpected:  At 9:03pm decided to ask why they are running so behind, as I saw two other couples that arrived after us get seated.  The hostess claimed they had already paged us which is complete BS as I had the pager in my hand the entire time sitting with the herd at the foyer with my 8 month pregnant wife, so I was not pleased. However, they did get us seated immediately after realizing their error, but took a while to get seated once they call you up with your pager. Our waiter, Christian was terrible.  Initially a waitress named Jenny got our order and I wish she would have remained our waitress.  This dude never came back to ask if we needed water and only until the very end did he fill up our cups.  Completely ridiculous.  I know they are busy, but come on, do your job.

1642,Kimberly T.,"New York, United States",40,102,324.0,2.0,2013-06-23,"Disclaimer: this is only about the service, not the food. I am sure the food is wonderful.  I was planning a banquet for around 20 people and had one of my members call this location to try to reserve a table on a Monday night. They told him that while they did not do reservations past 5:30 or so, they were not busy on Monday nights and that they should be able to accommodate us easily.  Because they had reassured us that it would be fine, we decided to hold our banquet at The Cheesecake Factory. I told my entire group to meet there at 7. I got there 15 minutes early just in case. When I got there, however, I was informed that the wait time would be at LEAST an hour and a half. I informed them about what my member had been told, but they said that no one should ever have told us that since it was impossible to promise seating.  As if they thought that this was a viable solution, they told me that if I split up my banquet into 2 groups of 10, they could get us in within 45 minutes. Needless to say, you can't split up a banquet. And even if you could, that wait time is still way too long. The rest of my party arrived dressed nicely for a banquet but were unable to be seated until well after we were promised. This forced us to frantically call different restaurants in the area to see who could hold a party of 20 right at that moment with no reservation. Luckily, California Pizza Kitchen had just enough room, and we were able to walk there to hold our banquet.  Regardless though, Cheesecake Factory should not have made false assurances they couldn't keep. This is not a rant, but rather a reflection on how Cheesecake Factory could've easily ruined our end-of-the-year banquet simply because they tried to earn our business by saying they could seat us quickly, when they knew very well that they couldn't keep a promise like that.

1832,Kevin D.,"Santa Cruz, United States",0,15,2.0,2.0,2013-07-04,"It was our first time at The Cheesecake Factory. And to start off with good: The decor is really nice! Probably too nice for the low-quality food and service, so maybe it set my expectations too high. This is a great place for cheap kids food, although my kid's cheese pizza tasted like soap. Life advice: Please do not get the fettuccine with chicken and sun-dried tomatoes, unless you enjoy tough chicken, Chef Boyardee sauce, and bland pasta. When our server asked how it was, I said, ""Not great, it's..."" but then she walked away. I wanted to order something else, so I waited for the server to come back. They didn't. I asked another server if they could get ours, and they said sure! And 10 minutes later, no one. So I went in back to ask for help, they said they'd be right over -- and still didn't! And another 10 minutes went by -- so I went back again! And like a bad joke, they said they'd be right over, and believe it or not, they still did not show up. They did offer to reduce our bill, but I didn't want that. I just wanted to know how we'd become invisible, and I really wanted to eat something besides the bread and my kid's soap pizza. I think I've been spoiled by good restaurants. To be fair, if you like food at Chili's or Applebee's, you'll probably like this.

Dirty dishes were also a problem. Luckily, they started a shift change while I was eating. Everything changed for the better. Quicker response times, more attentiveness, etc. My second waitress was much better at her job than the hostesses or my original waiter. All that said, I did complain to the manager. He appeared to be very concerned with the issues I had and voluntarily gave me a significant discount on my meal. He did a great job of turning a bad experience into a more positive one.

We usually get 3 appetizers to share and each get our own main dish. We even get a cheesecake to wash everything down. I like the strawberry lemonade and that has unlimited refills. We've never had a problem with the service. They are pretty good about bringing your food out and refilling your water. There's so much to choose on the menu. We like trying new things. Everything is pretty good. There's room for improvement for some of the food though. For example, I ordered the spring summer rolls and the wrap was all broken. They did not know how to wrap a Vietnamese spring roll lol. The crab cheese wonton is also good. The lobster and artichoke dip is good. Ahhhh my mouth is watering as I'm listing some of their yummy food. My hubby liked the pork chop but to me it was kinda dry but that's just me. I liked the hibachi steak but he did not like it. I remember not liking the club sandwich either. Overall everything is pretty good. They also give you bread and butter while you wait for your food so that's cool if you are hella hungry. Our bill is usually $100 because we don't eat here often and like to go all out. I still say its a good date place but if you're cheap then go eat at the food court lol. One con is that our snicker cheesecake was old one time. You can taste the old ness. $7.50 for an old slice of cheesecake is a no no.

It only had bacon in it and I asked the waitress are there suppose to be mushrooms in this dish, and she said no. I swear there was, but I kept eating it because I was so hungry and it was really good. Later on I asked for a menu and checked that everything in my pasta was missing. I only said no peas.....it was really good still, but I told my waitress. She went and told the manager and took 25% off the bill. She didn't have to do that, but was so nice about it.

The portions are pretty big so you will probably have leftovers. A negative is that the wait is around 45 minutes My review will be based off of their famous desserts! There are soooo many delicious slices of cheesecake/cake to choose from and it was just so hard to choose one. I ended up making a great decision and got the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple cake. MY GOODNESS. EVERYTHING YOU WANT AND MORE. Peanut butter, chocolate and I even found a piece of butterfinger on the bottom. It is VERY rich and thick so I only finished half and saved the other half for the next day.

We usually get 3 appetizers to share and each get our own main dish. We even get a cheesecake to wash everything down. I like the strawberry lemonade and that has unlimited refills. We've never had a problem with the service. They are pretty good about bringing your food out and refilling your water. There's so much to choose on the menu. We like trying new things. Everything is pretty good. There's room for improvement for some of the food though. For example, I ordered the spring summer rolls and the wrap was all broken. They did not know how to wrap a Vietnamese spring roll lol. The crab cheese wonton is also good. The lobster and artichoke dip is good. Ahhhh my mouth is watering as I'm listing some of their yummy food. My hubby liked the pork chop but to me it was kinda dry but that's just me. I liked the hibachi steak but he did not like it. I remember not liking the club sandwich either. Overall everything is pretty good. They also give you bread and butter while you wait for your food so that's cool if you are hella hungry. Our bill is usually $100 because we don't eat here often and like to go all out. I still say its a good date place but if you're cheap then go eat at the food court lol. One con is that our snicker cheesecake was old one time. You can taste the old ness. $7.50 for an old slice of cheesecake is a no no.

We were seated relatively quickly though, at a table with lackluster service- not at all on par with my expectations for this restaurant. BF's dad had the worst luck here- ordered a margarita that was 80% tequila, first time I've seen him not finish a drink in quite some time. He also opted for the chicken tortilla soup, which had only one flavor: spice. Literally seemed like mush accented with pepper. Sent it back to a baffled-looking waitress who couldn't seem to understand why anyone wouldn't love that soup. Did not taste like any other chicken tortilla soup we've ever had, and not in a good way. Also had the salmon wontons, which were just okay. BF's mom had the luau salad which was surprisingly vibrant and huge- I boxed leftovers up and took to work for lunch today. Salad usually doesn't save, especially not when dressed, but other than the crunchy bits being soggy, it held up relatively well. Lots of peppers and a delicious dressing, though I can't recall what it was called and it probably had more calories in it than anything else on the table. BF and I opted to share the tuna tartare small plate and the Boston salad with bleu cheese dressing instead of ranch- salad was by far my favorite, it was huge and had plentiful amounts of the assorted toppings, just wish it was tossed prior to arriving at the table, as it was so dark in our particular booth that we didn't figure it out for a few minutes. The tuna was just okay- BF seemed to like it more than I did, and I liked the marinade at the bottom, but just wasn't really my thing. We wrapped up the meal with a slice of the white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake, shared between the four of us and still deadly- and surprisingly delicious! Crust is made of a pecan sandie cookie, which sounds amazing because it is. Highly recommend that. Our waitress was MIA most of our visit and stopped by to check on us once. Drinks didn't get refilled and  table was cleared in an awkward and clumsy manner that seemed to indicate she was in a hurry to leave, even though we hadn't ordered dessert- and we had to prompt her for a dessert menu in the first place.

They were being rude to the waitress and trying to get free stuff. I absolutely can't stand people like that, so I apologize on their behalf. Our waitress was very sweet and it's not her fault the cook messed up my food. I've worked in the industry before and know how difficult it can be. Everybody's mess ups falls on the waiters/waitresses. People have to be more understanding and stop acting like entitled douche lords.

It was expected because we came on New Years. The wait time to get a table was 2.5 hours!! This was around 7pm. We ended up just picking up our cheesecakes at the register. The line wasn't very long & we got our cheesecakes very quickly despite the crowd waiting in the lobby. My bf & I shared the caramel turtle pecan cheesecake. So good! Just very sweet so we had to drink water almost after every bite. My friends ordered the Oreo & Reese's cheesecakes.

We waited 1 hr and 20min.  Eveytime we asked how much longer they kept saying 5 min 5 min!!! fianly after getting quite fed up the finaly sitted up. We saw plenty of tables avail but i have no idea why they would sit us. The food was good. We had the fish tacos, kids meals, hambugers and of course cheesecake. The slices are pretty big so i would suggest sharing for sure.

I am not a huge fan of big chain restaurants, but the Cheesecake Factory has always been a fan favorite amongst several of my friends. It is a great place for friends to meet up and the menu has enough variety to satisfy most everyone's taste.   Surprisingly, I have never had an unusually long wait at this location, like I have at so many of the other Cheesecake Factories. Our wait was approximately 30 minutes, which wasn't too bad on a Thursday night. I have had as long as a 2 hour wait when I went to the Marina Del Rey location on a weekend night. Uuugh! We sat down at a table across the floor from the bar. The old world charm of the decor and the sultry lighting adds to the charm of this place. Our waitress was friendly and helpful with describing items on the menu that some of us were unfamiliar with. She was also great at making suggestions on certain items. I ordered one of their signature combinations: Chicken Madeira and Steak Diane. It is a sauteed chicken breast with fresh asparagus & melted mozzarella cheese, topped with a mushroom Madeira Sauce. It is so tasty! It didn't sound at all that appealing on the menu, but I am so glad that it was suggested and I ordered it. The chicken was tender and the various flavors really made this dish a hit. I believe I found a new favorite! The Steak Diane are beef medallions covered with black peppercorns & a rich mushroom wine sauce, served with mashed potatoes. My meat was not cooked at all the way I asked! I told them I like my meat medium, more on the rare side, but no blood! I want it pink without blood oozing out! I was assured that they would make it the way I wanted, but that this would be considered medium cooked. It came to me tough and chewy. You would have thought I asked for it to be cooked well done. I hadn't plan to say anything because there was so much food on my plate that I knew I would not be able to eat it. Besides, I was enjoying my chicken. But one of my friends mentioned it to my waitress. She came over and I explained to her how the meat was. She took a look at it and agreed that it was over cooked. There was no pink in the meat at all. She went back to the kitchen and came back with another steak cooked exactly the way I had asked and my friend ate it because I was stuffed! He loved it! lol! My friends ordered a variety of cheesecakes to share, but I am not a huge fan of cheesecake. I had an ex- that had me on cheesecake overload and I have stayed away from it ever since! But OMG! The Strawberry Shortcake is so yummy! It is made on their own homemade biscuit, sprinkled with sugar and covered with fresh strawberries, vanilla ice cream, and whipped cream. I love it! I know most people come here to eat their incredibly tasting cheesecakes. There are so many to choose from. But I love the Strawberry Shortcake! All their dinner portions are huge.

543,Jimmy L.,"San Jose, CA",33,854,133.0,4.0,2014-05-12,"I've been here a few times over the last coupla years since my last review, and they have a consistently good formula going on.  Parking sucks, of course! Service and wait times suffer because of their volume in terms of food, drink, and larger parties, though am willing to sacrifice for the quality and servings you get in return for the decent price points.  I AM a foodie, and picky about it, and how it's served, etc. For now, this restaurant works well for me since they're not too formal, and yet they're not po-dunk, and it's a place to which I can go to with family, or if I just wanna have fun with friends. This last visit, though, I went with the Baja Chicken Tacos, which were good. The web description is as follows -  Soft Corn Tortillas Filled with Spicy Chicken, Cheese, Avocado,Tomato, Onions and Cilantro. Served with Black Beans and Rice. They could've been ""slightly warmer"", though we had already been waiting a whole hour and 15 minutes for our table; not to mention the wait-time for food, so I wasn't about to send it back. Still pretty good, though.  The chicken was on the border being barely moist and still decent. Didn't taste the spice, either. Asked for extra avocado, though don't think they really added any extra, cuz each taco only had a quarter of an avocado on top of each one; the waiter claimed that they added extra.

I went back a couple of days ago with my family, and we haven't been in a couple of years...and back then we LOVED TCF. Maybe it was because I was still a kid back then and totally loved the glitz and glamor of the beautiful large space...but the quality of the food, service, and ambiance have completely changed for the worse. Located in the prime space of Valley Fair shopping center, EVERYBODY I know has been to this TCF location. With that being said, you're always going to have a wait whether it's 5 minutes or over a solid hour. The place is GRAND and gorgeous with their European-painted ceilings and royal setup and white-clad servers. However, the place felt so empty and the AC was turned up way too high on the weekday night that I was there. A few years ago, TCF was always bustling with people out in front, and the place was packed with chattering and laughter, but we just didn't get that the night we ate here. Maybe it was because it was a strange weekday night, but who knows. We were served by Bridget, and she was polite and smiley, but only came around to check on us once in a while. We really enjoyed her going above and beyond to give us a sweet Happy Birthday ice cream, so thanks girl! As a server in the industry, I just wanted to comment on the unfortunate dress code policy! I felt so bad for the servers because they had to wear ALL WHITE (top and bottoms), so it was more obvious to see their stains and what not...but that's just me being a picky observer. In terms of the food, it was a bit pricey for the portion size/quality. I had Evelyn's Favorite pasta...and it was WAYYYYYY TOO SALTY! My mom also had a pasta that was pesto of some sort, and we both agreed that we were just oversalted with our taste buds! The flavors were pretty yummy, but the pasta chef really needs to tone down the salt level. I wouldn't come back here in a while--too much has changed in the last couple of years, so it would take lots of convincing for anyone in my family to come back. There are better options across the street in Santana Row--so I highly recommend going there versus TCF here.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=280,3.8,3.44,3.524,3.3680000000000003,3.584

The food was fantastic, (try the clam chowder).... as I am used to with Cheesecake Factory, but tonight Daniel and his service stepped up the game. I will now choose Valley Fair Cheesecake factory over Oakridge every time I choose to dine there.  It's like this guy (Daniel) appeared out of nowhere, refilling our drinks, checking up to see how we were, or just holding a friendly conversation while taking our order.  To top it all off, at the end of our meal, he brought us lemon scented hot towels... Where am I.... A spa? But seriously.

I've been to this location as well as the one at Oakridge Mall plenty of times over the last few years. When comparing my favorite dishes, this location has always done a better job.  Been trying to eat healthier, trying is the key word, so I like how Cheesecake Factory has their Skinnylicious menu.

I had the Cajun jambalaya pasta and it was delicious! The noodles were well cooked with tender pieces of chicken and shrimp. The sauce was amazing although I wish they made it a little bit spicier. The design of the plate was perfection as well with sprinkles of parsley and I believe cayenne or paprika.  For dessert I had the chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake. I forgot how big the portions are but I finished a little bit more than half. It was delicious with the Oreo crust and creamy cheesecake with bits of chocolate chips and cookie dough.

However we always forget to call ahead to have their birthday cheesecake/dessert defrosted before coming every year for each birthday event. This time, I made certain to call ahead and Francine, front end greeter did an amazing job. I could hear in the background it was very busy. She still managed to help me by asking if she could put me on hold so she could run to their bakery to find out what cheesecakes were available and in what sizes. When she came back I had another question for her in which she politely asked if she could call me back as she was going to be off in another half hour and would then be able to better assist me. What a wonderful employee to spend her nonworking unpaid time to help me with my question which was pricing on the cakes. She indeed called me back with the cake prices and additionally gave me some great news that she had spoken with the manager and they could give me a reservation for our dinner party since they don't normally do reservations after 5pm (we were coming at 7:30pm and taking our chances walking in.) She also made sure that two of her associates knew that we were coming, had a cake reserved and set out to be defrosted and that I would be bringing in candles.  When we got there, everything was taking care of as promised and even our server, Justin was already briefed on everything. He tended to our table exceptionally well, always cheerful and made sure we were happy and had everything we needed. We tried new dishes and they were all amazing and delicious. The dinner servings were as usual, very generous and everyone had enough leftovers for a full meal to eat the next day...really it was that much food! We also love how they write Happy Birthday on the plate that holds the cheesecake. A big THANK YOU and KUDOS to everyone involved especially Francine and Justin. After our dinner I made sure to speak with Mandy, the restaurant manager to let her know how thankful and impressed we were with both Francine and Justin and that although Francine had already gone home, we wanted the manager to know how much we appreciated her employees' professionalism and attentiveness to our needs.

I was hungry and left wanting for more at the end of my meal. We also ordered the Calabrian pizza and it was great. I think I've had the best pizzas at Wolfgang Puck and this one came in a close second. It was easy to bite into with the right amount of cheese and a good assortment of toppings.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=440,3.52,3.71,3.548,2.9600000000000004,3.6340000000000003

245,Jodi H.,"Silicon Valley, CA",290,812,1283.0,2.0,2014-09-07,"I've gotta say...Cheesecake Factory has gone dooooownhill in the past couple of years. I went back a couple of days ago with my family, and we haven't been in a couple of years...and back then we LOVED TCF. Maybe it was because I was still a kid back then and totally loved the glitz and glamor of the beautiful large space...but the quality of the food, service, and ambiance have completely changed for the worse. Located in the prime space of Valley Fair shopping center, EVERYBODY I know has been to this TCF location. With that being said, you're always going to have a wait whether it's 5 minutes or over a solid hour. The place is GRAND and gorgeous with their European-painted ceilings and royal setup and white-clad servers. However, the place felt so empty and the AC was turned up way too high on the weekday night that I was there. A few years ago, TCF was always bustling with people out in front, and the place was packed with chattering and laughter, but we just didn't get that the night we ate here. Maybe it was because it was a strange weekday night, but who knows. We were served by Bridget, and she was polite and smiley, but only came around to check on us once in a while. We really enjoyed her going above and beyond to give us a sweet Happy Birthday ice cream, so thanks girl! As a server in the industry, I just wanted to comment on the unfortunate dress code policy! I felt so bad for the servers because they had to wear ALL WHITE (top and bottoms), so it was more obvious to see their stains and what not...but that's just me being a picky observer. In terms of the food, it was a bit pricey for the portion size/quality. I had Evelyn's Favorite pasta...and it was WAYYYYYY TOO SALTY! My mom also had a pasta that was pesto of some sort, and we both agreed that we were just oversalted with our taste buds! The flavors were pretty yummy, but the pasta chef really needs to tone down the salt level. I wouldn't come back here in a while--too much has changed in the last couple of years, so it would take lots of convincing for anyone in my family to come back. There are better options across the street in Santana Row--so I highly recommend going there versus TCF here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=280,3.08,3.61,3.5,2.8880000000000003,3.398

She indeed called me back with the cake prices and additionally gave me some great news that she had spoken with the manager and they could give me a reservation for our dinner party since they don't normally do reservations after 5pm (we were coming at 7:30pm and taking our chances walking in.) She also made sure that two of her associates knew that we were coming, had a cake reserved and set out to be defrosted and that I would be bringing in candles.  When we got there, everything was taking care of as promised and even our server, Justin was already briefed on everything. He tended to our table exceptionally well, always cheerful and made sure we were happy and had everything we needed. We tried new dishes and they were all amazing and delicious. The dinner servings were as usual, very generous and everyone had enough leftovers for a full meal to eat the next day...really it was that much food! We also love how they write Happy Birthday on the plate that holds the cheesecake. A big THANK YOU and KUDOS to everyone involved especially Francine and Justin. After our dinner I made sure to speak with Mandy, the restaurant manager to let her know how thankful and impressed we were with both Francine and Justin and that although Francine had already gone home, we wanted the manager to know how much we appreciated her employees' professionalism and attentiveness to our needs. This is the reason why we always come back...fantastic service, fantastic food . :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1080,3.24,3.6,3.512,3.124,3.456000000000001

The menu is extentsive and I haven't tried anything I haven't liked yet. I will warn you though, there is usually a wait time of 20 minutes or more any time I have visited.  But you get free bread. The Brown bread is the bomb! Its a little sweet and 100% delicious. I always end up eating at least two rolls of it while waiting for my meal. I always pass on the White bread, its pretty blah.

384,Anthony B.,"Denver, CO",4,8,,5.0,2014-11-07,"Let me preface this review by saying that myself and the people I dined at Cheesecake Factory with this evening all have years of server experience. Our server tonight was Daniel, who absolutely blew us away.  I can't say enough good things about this experience, seriously. The food was fantastic, (try the clam chowder).... as I am used to with Cheesecake Factory, but tonight Daniel and his service stepped up the game. I will now choose Valley Fair Cheesecake factory over Oakridge every time I choose to dine there.  It's like this guy (Daniel) appeared out of nowhere, refilling our drinks, checking up to see how we were, or just holding a friendly conversation while taking our order.  To top it all off, at the end of our meal, he brought us lemon scented hot towels... Where am I.... A spa? But seriously. Major points because my girlfriend and I had lettuce wraps so my hands were feeling it.  Overall five freakin stars. Will dine again, just to sit in Daniel's section.

The manager then came out and apologized but they were so busy it took another 20 min for my new shrimp to come out. Once my meal came out it was good though!

Parking sucks, of course! Service and wait times suffer because of their volume in terms of food, drink, and larger parties, though am willing to sacrifice for the quality and servings you get in return for the decent price points.  I AM a foodie, and picky about it, and how it's served, etc. For now, this restaurant works well for me since they're not too formal, and yet they're not po-dunk, and it's a place to which I can go to with family, or if I just wanna have fun with friends. This last visit, though, I went with the Baja Chicken Tacos, which were good. The web description is as follows -  Soft Corn Tortillas Filled with Spicy Chicken, Cheese, Avocado,Tomato, Onions and Cilantro. Served with Black Beans and Rice. They could've been ""slightly warmer"", though we had already been waiting a whole hour and 15 minutes for our table; not to mention the wait-time for food, so I wasn't about to send it back. Still pretty good, though.  The chicken was on the border being barely moist and still decent. Didn't taste the spice, either. Asked for extra avocado, though don't think they really added any extra, cuz each taco only had a quarter of an avocado on top of each one; the waiter claimed that they added extra. I stand by the Romano Chicken as my favorite, also the warm (rye, i think) bread, and vanilla cheesecake.  On the other hand, I DO set my expectations accordingly, and would still come back for more, considering the quality, amount, and quality that you get for the price.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=660,2.08,2.98,3.296,3.088,2.62

My friend ordered a gluten free burger and they brought out a regular burger which they almost served to her. Both of us have gluten allergies so these kinds of mistakes cannot happen. This would be a huge liability!  They don't offer a single gluten free cheesecake option on their menu. Can you believe that? Another disappointment.

When they brought back my dish it looked like they gave me a brand new plate of pasta. They didn't take out the ricotta and it looked like they only gave me half of my portion.

A month later...I placed an order to go again for my brother who wanted the meat loaf and I ordered my cheesecake again. Yet again, they took about 30 minutes to get me the food I had placed 30 minutes prior!  When I got home, they didnt even pack the cheesecake!  I should have checked before I left to see if it was in there, but I had already waited the 30 minutes and just wanted to get out to beat rush hour. Finally, I came in to eat with my friend and we waited 30 minutes to be seated (there was no one there at 2pm on a Tuesday afternoon).  Once we sat down, no one came to serve us for another 15 minutes... with a completely empty restaurant!

We waited about 20 minutes to be seated.  After a few minutes our server brought us our drinks and bread and returned a few minutes later to take our order. We asked him what he would recommend and at first it seemed like he was a little annoyed with the questions. More like ""I'm busy, just hurry and order"", but after a minute he decided to be more helpful. My husband ordered the garlic noodle dish and I ordered the four cheese pasta with chicken.  Both dishes were decent, not horrible but definitely nothing spectacular. Wouldn't order either dish again.  I went with the intention of having a slice of cheesecake for dessert but ended up not getting a slice after all.  Not for any bad reason,  I was just full.

As for the food, I tried out the Ligurian Pesto Pasta but it's too rich/oily and wasn't that tasty.  In the past I've had the Evelyns Pasta which I think is the best vegetarian item they've got.  I've also had the Cuban sandwich, also a tasty item.  Appropriately I think they've got the best cheesecakes in town so you can't go wrong there.

I ended up ordering the pasta carbonara gluten free. The waiter got it wrong and brought me pasta with tomato sauce. They had to take it back and remake my original order, which came out super soggy and watery!! It is probably the worst carbonara I've ever had. It was more like a soup!! So disappointed!  My friend ordered a gluten free burger and they brought out a regular burger which they almost served to her. Both of us have gluten allergies so these kinds of mistakes cannot happen. This would be a huge liability!  They don't offer a single gluten free cheesecake option on their menu. Can you believe that? Another disappointment.  Cheesecake needs to step up their game on gluten free menu offerings or else I'm never coming back here.  I could've made a huge commotion about these screw ups but I didn't want to deal with the drama. It was the new year and so I just wanted to be chill about things...

But for some reason today my dish came out cold and the cheese was not even melted. I'll give them a plus for leaving out the ricotta. I tasted the pasta and it was still cold and there was chunks of cheese everywhere in the dish. So I sent it back for them to reheat my dish. When they brought back my dish it looked like they gave me a brand new plate of pasta. They didn't take out the ricotta and it looked like they only gave me half of my portion. Weird because I only took a bite of my dish before I sent it back. There was more cheese than pasta. When I tasted it, the pasta was still cold to warm. Ehh it was whatever to much.

When we got here, we saw it was packed, but I knew that the wait would be long for bigger parties. Since it was just my husband and I, it only took 15 minutes for a table. And what's great was that it was just as the hostess said: 15 to 20 minute wait. Started off with a Blueberry Mojito for myself and Stella Artois for the hubby. Definitely get a Blueberry Mojito, always! They make it so yummy that I can't taste the alcohol and that can be dangerous for me because then I want more and I'll get drunk way faster than I can imagine. But that's a different story. I ordered the steak diane (medium rare) and herb crusted salmon combo which came with asparagus and mashed potatoes. And I ordered a side of macaroni and cheese. My husband ordered the hibachi steak (medium rare) which also came with mashed potatoes and he ordered a side of corn succotash. SO GOOD! Everything we had was definitely up to par and my mouth is just watering just thinking about that salmon though. Lemon butter sauce? PERFECTION.

Feeling a bit adventurous, I asked the waitress to help me off the beaten path and I decided on a Chicken Madeira, which is one of their most popular items. The chicken dish was moist and tender (just like our server said) and I had no complaints. Accompanying the chicken was a crazy amount of nicely seasoned mashed potatoes flecked with bits of red potato skin and couple stalks of asparagus. My dining companion had the factory burger which came with fries and was also pleased with his meal. In addition to our entree, we shared a salad of arugula, beets, apple, and goat cheese. Since I liked this salad combo, I decided to make it for a dinner party I was hosting that weekend. After the dinner, we, of course, had to have a cheesecake and ordered the limited edition salted caramel and it tasted as heavenly as it looked.

Since it took so long to get our food I thought it was a good idea when our food came out to place my To Go order for my spouse at home, so the order would be out in time. We waited another hour for my to go order. When I asked about the 4 times, he said "" He was waiting for the order"", then "" He was looking for the order"", then "" They didn't bring it out"" and last "" Oh it was sitting up there waiting for you to tell me you are ready"". I proceeded to check my food, the chicken and mashed potatoes where cold. I told the server this and he said "" I can have it warmed up for you"", I told him I could do that at home.

What was confusing about it, though, is that they give you the pager but when it goes off they just have you wait some more. When my party was called, there were so many people just standing around the front desk that it took us about forty five seconds to reach the desk, but by the time we got up there, the hostess had already crossed our names off and was calling the next group. Still, they took us, but it was another half hour after being seated that our server actually introduced herself and offered to bring water. I understand it was busy but we saw her only that one time before she asked us to order. So, we ordered drinks, appetizers, and our meals at the same time. We got our drink after about twenty minutes, but we got our bread at the same time the wrong appetizer arrived!! In the end we got our appetizer at the same time we got our meals. We had been sitting for almost two hours before we got our food.   My boyfriend said the fettuccine alfredo was just okay, and I thought that the shrimp scampi was about three stars. The sauce and the pasta were good but the shrimp was very, very chewy (overcooked or undercooked?). It wasn't bad so I didn't send it back or anything, although that wouldn't have been possible because we hadn't seen our server since we ordered.  When we were finished eating, I spoke to our server since it was my boyfriend's birthday and I asked what they could do and she said they give a little cup of ice cream and sing Happy Birthday, which sounded good to me. Well, they never did. There were at least three other birthdays in between the time I spoke to her and the time we left, including one at the next table over, but not for my guy. I felt really bad because this was the only thing we ended up being able to do for his birthday.  While we were eating, there was a particularly fussy toddler across the aisle from us who threw a bowl on the ground, and the hundreds of sharp little pieces hit myself and a few other people nearby, but no one came to clean anything up even though a few of us were sitting there with cuts all over our legs. Our area wasn't very clean at all, likely because they were trying to get people in an out as quickly as possible. There was a fork and napkin underneath our table and not until we received our check did anything off of our table get cleared.  In the end, I wish I'd given a smaller tip. I feel so, so bad that this went so horribly, because it was my boyfriend's birthday and we wanted to come here to celebrate.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=580,3.32,3.12,3.12,2.212,3.2000000000000006

The sinks are run by a timer, the other two sinks don't run as long as the first. We have told two different managers on two occasions. Hasn't been fixed, minus one star!  The food here, depending on what you get, is usually pretty good. I go here semi-regularly, here are my favorites:  Appetizers:  *Fried Mac N Cheese*- Delicious! Must try! I order it every time, but beware, don't let them get cold! Eat them PIPING HOT! Crispy outer layer holds well, with gooey EXTREMELY cheesy shell mac inside. I can't resist, it comes with 4, and they are fairly large.  *Potstickers*- Potstickers are potstickers, the sauce is amazing!  Entrees:  *Crusted Chicken Romano* I believe it comes with pasta which I do not care for, so I always sub. for mashed potatoes.  *Orange chicken* Truly one of my absolute favorites here, fried chicken with sweet orange sauce, amd the rice here really good! (Weird, I know, because its just steamed white rice, but it goes so well with the sauce!)  My sister, brother and dad pretty much always enjoy the *Chicken Madeira* which I know is very popular. Cheesecake:  *Tuxedo* ALL TIME FAVORITE. Have been eating this cheesecake since I was a kid! (I should really be a chubster..) *White Chocolate Raspberry* If you like raspberry at all, YOU MUST TRY THIS, if you haven't had anything White Chocolate & Raspberry you need to seriously make it a priority, haha, because it is the BEST combonation in the WORLD!  *Oreo* Standard oreo cheesecake. Pretty f***ing good!  Raspberry lemonade is definitely recommended!  The interior is beautiful! Kind of fancy but not like you need to dress up. Place is kept clean, bathrooms and eating areas, along with small waiting area (which gets crowded durimg rush hours) are all nicely maintained.  Service is hit or miss, sometimes you get placed in a bad servers section.. For the most part with the exception of a few dishes (Bbq Pizza, Cajun Chicken Pasta, etc.) I like the food & will continue to come back (& Update if/when the fossit time has been reduced!)  Get there early and definitely don't go STARVING because you probably won't be eating anything until 45mins after you are seated.

The ones I often speak to are Gilbert, Chris and Justin; their service is right at the level of high class saloon bartenders, very knowledgable and professional (trust me, I've been to many). I'm the kind of girl who's straight forward and cannot tolerate bullshit; when I casually ask for fine scotch, they know what I'm talking about (most bartenders from other chain restaurants often provide miss information). I find it very enjoyable to have a nice fine scotch and dinner here at the bar; If the bar takes a 45-min wait versus table, take the bar any day.

2567,Xin W.,"San Francisco, CA",294,111,234.0,4.0,2015-04-24,"So I'm always on this endless pursuit in finding the best cheesecake. There are various qualities that I look at: the texture (and how smooth it is), the softness/fluffiness of it (it should melt in your mouth), the balance of sweetness and tanginess, the levels of acidity (very important in a rich dish like the cheesecake), the crust (not too thick and not too thin) and how crunchy it is, the flavors, the presentation, and the freshness (especially when there are fruit toppings). The secret is to bake the cheesecake low and slow to prevent it from cracking, to prevent the sides from rising and the center from sinking, and to result in a light, moussey texture. However unless you're Gordon Ramsay or on Masterchef, it usually take 5+ hours to bake the perfect cheesecake. Cheesecake Factory add synthetic binders, like guar gum and xanthan gum, to their batter to allow it to be baked faster while still holding it together. While the cheesecake here is definitely not the best I've tasted, it tastes pretty good. My favorite is the Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake. Nice bite of acidity, good balance of sweetness and tanginess, thin crunchy crust with an airy-looking texture. All of the other cheesecake I've eaten here are either too sweet or too rich.

We were informed that Marsha, the manager ""did what she had to do."" Well, Marsha, I'll tell you what you have to do.... Inform your customers as to when you'll be making them wait over an hour for a table that you'll be giving away TWICE with no warning. It's really not that hard to do. That being said, we took our money to California Pizza Kitchen where they IMMEDIATELY accommodated our large group at a late hour (due to the ludicrous wait at Cheesecake factory) and we were treated with the upmost customer service.  So- if you have a large party, or really even a small party- take your money somewhere that you'll actually be treated with CUSTOMER SERVICE- such as California Pizza Kitchen.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=620,2.52,3.13,3.04,2.244,2.8859999999999997

We put our name down at 7:20 for a party of 14 and was told the expected time is 1.75 to 2 hour wait . We had no problem because it is a Saturday night . However after 2 hours, we did not even receive a buzzer . 30 minutes later we got a buzzer and said about a 10 minute wait before we can be seated . We waited another 20 minutes until I found out that other customers would not leave the tables that we needed . No buggy, it's not their fault .  However , our tables were set and we sat ourselves because no host came to take us to our seats . Then right off the bat, our waitress comes with a small attitude trying to rush us to get our orders in . After ordering, our food took almost 30 minutes to come out, and you can not tell me that they wait for all the food to be ready because all the burgers did not come until 10 minutes after . Another issue that really irked me was when a guest of mine asked for cheese the waitress never came with any so we asked again , and we let her know that we asked and she said she would come back and she then replied with attitude, rolled her eyes, and walked away .  Lastly, my food came out dry and I requested for some extra sauce and I asked 2 different waiters for the sauce . I waited until half my party already finished their food before I called the manager to complain . Fortunately the manager was nice enough to give my food for free, take away gratuity, as well ask pack my food up with its extra sauce . Afterwards, three other waiters along with or waitresses were off staring at us and whispering.  This place has one of the most rude service I have ever experienced . I expected so much more from such a big restaurant as Cheesecake Factory.

Perfect for when you want to go for a nice dinner on a budget.  This location does not take reservations, at least it didn't when I tried to make one on the Saturday of Mother's Day. The wait is long, and they don't tell you accurate wait times. If the wait is actually an hour, they'll tell you half an hour. Just watch out for that and be prepared to wait longer than what you expect.  They give you a buzzer that alerts you at limited range so go shop around Valley Fair and come back when it's almost your turn to be called.  Excellent Service - Friendly, attentive, and polite waitstaff.  Portobello Mushroom, Avocado, Zuchini small plate - These are all deep fried and served with this chipotle style cream based sauce. It's delicious.  It came out very crispy and with a lot of batter, more than I prefer for my taste but that's what makes it come out crunchy. The portion is just enough for a party of 4 to each try a mushroom, avocado, and zucchini piece.  Vietnamese summer shrimp spring roll - Sweet and fragrant. This is not your typical Vietnamese springroll! The ingredients are not your typical bean sprouts and basal. They're stuffed with thick plump shrimp and various veggies that have been pickled and/or marinated. The flavors work very well together. It comes with 2 types of sauces! One is the typical peanut based dipping sauce, and other is a sweeter, teriyaki style sauce.  We chose to order these apps because everything else on the menu was a lot of fried/creamy/fatty stuff. Yes the mushroom/avocado/zucchini platter was fried, but at least there's some veggie based foods in there. I guess this just shows how limited your options are when you're going for something 'healthier'. Hibachi steak - the steak was delicious, as expected. You can't really go wrong with steak aside from not seasoning it properly and not getting the right cook on it. It came out to a good medium well, and was still moist and juicy on the inside. This dish was served with garlic red mashed potatoes with a hint of wasabi over the top! Soo good.  Turkey burger - I ordered this with sweet potato fries. As with all turkey burgers, the meat patty is gonna come out dry, nothing you can really do about it, and that's kinda the point of ordering a less fattening/healthier burger. The turkey was still seasoned well. I've had a lot better burgers elsewhere so it would be fair for me to say I'm disappointed in their burgers.  You cannot leave cheesecake factory without ordering their cheesecake! 30th anniversary cheesecake - It's basically a mix of chocolate and vanilla. Absolutely delicious. Thick, rich, creamy, and it just melts in your mouth. The cake portions are soft and moist, and complements the cream cheese area of the cake.

After being seated, our server took our orders in a very impolite manner.  Also, we were missing 2 waters at one side of the table and was told she'd bring it but never did.  That was the same thing with adding cheese to the pasta my sister ordered and when asked for the cheese again, the server had the audacity to give attitude and say 'oh you wanted cheese?' In addition to that, my bf didn't even get the burger he ordered yet and said he'd have to wait a little longer then bc of the cheese. EXCUSE ME?? Really? Then she continued to roll her eyes and walk away.  It also got to the point where we had to ask and talk with the manager.

PRICE  - Their lunch special is fairly reasonably priced - ranging from $10-15 depending on what you pick. We had the pasta and the salad from the lunch special.

So you can actually eat the whole plate without craving something spicy to balance the creaminess of the pasta. Also, I really liked the way the chicken was fried!

I called and ordered to go and when I came to pick up my food (just the dolce de leche cheesecake with extra whip cream), I still had to wait 20 mins after I had called 15 minutes earlier.  This happened on 2 occasions. A month later...I placed an order to go again for my brother who wanted the meat loaf and I ordered my cheesecake again. Yet again, they took about 30 minutes to get me the food I had placed 30 minutes prior!  When I got home, they didnt even pack the cheesecake!  I should have checked before I left to see if it was in there, but I had already waited the 30 minutes and just wanted to get out to beat rush hour. Finally, I came in to eat with my friend and we waited 30 minutes to be seated (there was no one there at 2pm on a Tuesday afternoon).  Once we sat down, no one came to serve us for another 15 minutes... with a completely empty restaurant!

It's a great place for us to connect on a weekly basis and we've had no problems in the past. This time was different. Four of us arrived in the bar and lounge area and business was understandably slow for a weekday. Regardless of slow business, our server took 15-20 minutes to even greet us. We then proceeded to order and asked simple questions about the menu and drink specials. She did not know any answers in regards to pricing or to what comes with certain items. The brainless server had to ask the bartender near by all our questions. She then returned and exclaimed to us that she ""hadn't worked a Happy Hour in over a year in a half.""  I knew then we were in for a fun lunch yet we proceed to enter our order. My coworker asked for a burger WITHOUT Thousand Island dressing, my other coworker asked for a small side of fries. Both of these orders were brought back incorrectly. The burger was smoothed in dressing, and we had a huge bowl of large fries in front of us. The server then decided to disappear for another 20 minutes and we were greeted with a new server and we were told he was ""taking over."" The first server wasn't off of work, she couldn't handle working with multiple tables and cowardly made her way towards the back. They attempted to correct our orders but that took another 20 minutes, by that time we had to go back to work. We asked to speak to a manager, perhaps they could comp one of our items or maybe just a simple apology. We received neither. Instead THE MANAGER GRACE, proceeded to argue back and forth with my coworker to the point of shouting. As a manager this type of behavior is unacceptable. She finally comped our burger which was 5 dollars by the way, and then took ONE DOLLAR off our incorrect fries order.  Never will we return to this location and we spread the word to the rest of our team as well. Sometimes people don't want things for free, people just want to be heard and acknowledged.

However, the system they currently have in taking names and wait time is beyond ridiculous. The most inconvenient part, is that they do not take reservations on weekends. Weekends are the busiest times. Especially for large party events. Tonight, my friend hosted a birthday dinner. Because they do not take reservations, we had to wait close to two hours to be seated. Mind you, we all arrived at 6:00PM. We were not seated until 8:45PM. We were a party of 13. If they would just allow people to make reservations, this ridiculous wait time and terrible experience would not be happening. My friends and I were not happy with the rude treatment given when we were trying to ask about our table.

489,Gabrielle L.,"Pleasanton, CA",29,63,9.0,1.0,2015-08-04,"I'm really disappointed to be writing such a negative review because I've had wonderful experiences in other locations. This, though, was a total disaster. If there was an option for zero stars, I would give it.  Yes, the wait is long, but that is the case in pretty much every location anywhere close to a meal time. What was confusing about it, though, is that they give you the pager but when it goes off they just have you wait some more. When my party was called, there were so many people just standing around the front desk that it took us about forty five seconds to reach the desk, but by the time we got up there, the hostess had already crossed our names off and was calling the next group. Still, they took us, but it was another half hour after being seated that our server actually introduced herself and offered to bring water. I understand it was busy but we saw her only that one time before she asked us to order. So, we ordered drinks, appetizers, and our meals at the same time. We got our drink after about twenty minutes, but we got our bread at the same time the wrong appetizer arrived!! In the end we got our appetizer at the same time we got our meals. We had been sitting for almost two hours before we got our food.   My boyfriend said the fettuccine alfredo was just okay, and I thought that the shrimp scampi was about three stars. The sauce and the pasta were good but the shrimp was very, very chewy (overcooked or undercooked?). It wasn't bad so I didn't send it back or anything, although that wouldn't have been possible because we hadn't seen our server since we ordered.  When we were finished eating, I spoke to our server since it was my boyfriend's birthday and I asked what they could do and she said they give a little cup of ice cream and sing Happy Birthday, which sounded good to me. Well, they never did. There were at least three other birthdays in between the time I spoke to her and the time we left, including one at the next table over, but not for my guy. I felt really bad because this was the only thing we ended up being able to do for his birthday.  While we were eating, there was a particularly fussy toddler across the aisle from us who threw a bowl on the ground, and the hundreds of sharp little pieces hit myself and a few other people nearby, but no one came to clean anything up even though a few of us were sitting there with cuts all over our legs. Our area wasn't very clean at all, likely because they were trying to get people in an out as quickly as possible. There was a fork and napkin underneath our table and not until we received our check did anything off of our table get cleared.  In the end, I wish I'd given a smaller tip. I feel so, so bad that this went so horribly, because it was my boyfriend's birthday and we wanted to come here to celebrate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=580,3.28,3.09,3.124,2.6600000000000006,3.166

The sinks are run by a timer, the other two sinks don't run as long as the first. We have told two different managers on two occasions. Hasn't been fixed, minus one star!  The food here, depending on what you get, is usually pretty good. I go here semi-regularly, here are my favorites:  Appetizers:  *Fried Mac N Cheese*- Delicious! Must try! I order it every time, but beware, don't let them get cold! Eat them PIPING HOT! Crispy outer layer holds well, with gooey EXTREMELY cheesy shell mac inside. I can't resist, it comes with 4, and they are fairly large.  *Potstickers*- Potstickers are potstickers, the sauce is amazing!  Entrees:  *Crusted Chicken Romano* I believe it comes with pasta which I do not care for, so I always sub. for mashed potatoes.  *Orange chicken* Truly one of my absolute favorites here, fried chicken with sweet orange sauce, amd the rice here really good! (Weird, I know, because its just steamed white rice, but it goes so well with the sauce!)  My sister, brother and dad pretty much always enjoy the *Chicken Madeira* which I know is very popular. Cheesecake:  *Tuxedo* ALL TIME FAVORITE. Have been eating this cheesecake since I was a kid! (I should really be a chubster..) *White Chocolate Raspberry* If you like raspberry at all, YOU MUST TRY THIS, if you haven't had anything White Chocolate & Raspberry you need to seriously make it a priority, haha, because it is the BEST combonation in the WORLD!  *Oreo* Standard oreo cheesecake. Pretty f***ing good!  Raspberry lemonade is definitely recommended!  The interior is beautiful! Kind of fancy but not like you need to dress up. Place is kept clean, bathrooms and eating areas, along with small waiting area (which gets crowded durimg rush hours) are all nicely maintained.  Service is hit or miss, sometimes you get placed in a bad servers section.. For the most part with the exception of a few dishes (Bbq Pizza, Cajun Chicken Pasta, etc.) I like the food & will continue to come back (& Update if/when the fossit time has been reduced!)

And what's great was that it was just as the hostess said: 15 to 20 minute wait. Started off with a Blueberry Mojito for myself and Stella Artois for the hubby. Definitely get a Blueberry Mojito, always! They make it so yummy that I can't taste the alcohol and that can be dangerous for me because then I want more and I'll get drunk way faster than I can imagine. But that's a different story. I ordered the steak diane (medium rare) and herb crusted salmon combo which came with asparagus and mashed potatoes. And I ordered a side of macaroni and cheese. My husband ordered the hibachi steak (medium rare) which also came with mashed potatoes and he ordered a side of corn succotash. SO GOOD! Everything we had was definitely up to par and my mouth is just watering just thinking about that salmon though. Lemon butter sauce? PERFECTION.

We put our name down at 7:20 for a party of 14 and was told the expected time is 1.75 to 2 hour wait . We had no problem because it is a Saturday night . However after 2 hours, we did not even receive a buzzer . 30 minutes later we got a buzzer and said about a 10 minute wait before we can be seated . We waited another 20 minutes until I found out that other customers would not leave the tables that we needed . No buggy, it's not their fault .  However , our tables were set and we sat ourselves because no host came to take us to our seats . Then right off the bat, our waitress comes with a small attitude trying to rush us to get our orders in . After ordering, our food took almost 30 minutes to come out, and you can not tell me that they wait for all the food to be ready because all the burgers did not come until 10 minutes after . Another issue that really irked me was when a guest of mine asked for cheese the waitress never came with any so we asked again , and we let her know that we asked and she said she would come back and she then replied with attitude, rolled her eyes, and walked away .  Lastly, my food came out dry and I requested for some extra sauce and I asked 2 different waiters for the sauce . I waited until half my party already finished their food before I called the manager to complain . Fortunately the manager was nice enough to give my food for free, take away gratuity, as well ask pack my food up with its extra sauce . Afterwards, three other waiters along with or waitresses were off staring at us and whispering.  This place has one of the most rude service I have ever experienced .

After being seated, our server took our orders in a very impolite manner.  Also, we were missing 2 waters at one side of the table and was told she'd bring it but never did.  That was the same thing with adding cheese to the pasta my sister ordered and when asked for the cheese again, the server had the audacity to give attitude and say 'oh you wanted cheese?' In addition to that, my bf didn't even get the burger he ordered yet and said he'd have to wait a little longer then bc of the cheese. EXCUSE ME?? Really? Then she continued to roll her eyes and walk away.  It also got to the point where we had to ask and talk with the manager.

The server then decided to disappear for another 20 minutes and we were greeted with a new server and we were told he was ""taking over."" The first server wasn't off of work, she couldn't handle working with multiple tables and cowardly made her way towards the back. They attempted to correct our orders but that took another 20 minutes, by that time we had to go back to work. We asked to speak to a manager, perhaps they could comp one of our items or maybe just a simple apology. We received neither. Instead THE MANAGER GRACE, proceeded to argue back and forth with my coworker to the point of shouting. As a manager this type of behavior is unacceptable. She finally comped our burger which was 5 dollars by the way, and then took ONE DOLLAR off our incorrect fries order.

We waited about 20 minutes to be seated.  After a few minutes our server brought us our drinks and bread and returned a few minutes later to take our order. We asked him what he would recommend and at first it seemed like he was a little annoyed with the questions. More like ""I'm busy, just hurry and order"", but after a minute he decided to be more helpful. My husband ordered the garlic noodle dish and I ordered the four cheese pasta with chicken.  Both dishes were decent, not horrible but definitely nothing spectacular. Wouldn't order either dish again.

Asked if we wanted to replace it or get a dessert on the house. I refused to both because it wasn't about the freebee. They did take it off the bill though. They always have great service.

My dining companion had the factory burger which came with fries and was also pleased with his meal. In addition to our entree, we shared a salad of arugula, beets, apple, and goat cheese.

You put your name on the list and sit in the lobby area the size of the capitol rotunda. There are no soft surfaces and the tiny voice of the hostess is no match for the din. It's an annoying way to start the night and it's easily fixable.  The voluminous menu is overly confusing and includes advertising including one ad for an online service helping the friendless. Not a dating site. Just a site helping lonely people find other lonely people to become friends with. Festive, right?  The food seems overly fussy, a little bland and arrived just a tad on the cool side. We had no napkins and in asking for them were told that our server should have provided them. So now we have no napkins and feel like we've gotten our cheerful server in trouble.

It feels like a 3 star place but I can't give it 3 and look at that ""A-OK"" tagline when it's a ""Meh"" experience. This location always has a wait because it's popular. No crime there. You put your name on the list and sit in the lobby area the size of the capitol rotunda. There are no soft surfaces and the tiny voice of the hostess is no match for the din. It's an annoying way to start the night and it's easily fixable.  The voluminous menu is overly confusing and includes advertising including one ad for an online service helping the friendless. Not a dating site. Just a site helping lonely people find other lonely people to become friends with. Festive, right?  The food seems overly fussy, a little bland and arrived just a tad on the cool side. We had no napkins and in asking for them were told that our server should have provided them. So now we have no napkins and feel like we've gotten our cheerful server in trouble. ""I can take care of that"" would have been a better response since I have zero interest in the inner workings of the processes and procedures at TCF.  The wine list could be MUCH better. Particularly the by-the-glass list. My malbec showed up slightly oxidized and tired but after the napkin moment, I frankly wasn't looking for interaction with the staff. It wasn't terrible.

Located next to Westfield Valley Fair on Steven's Creek Boulevard, there is no denying that this is a lucrative establishment. Even at 8:30 pm on a Sunday night, there was still a 15 minute wait to grab a table at a place that must have HUNDREDS of seats. My sister, her husband, and I were too lazy to go anywhere far from the mall and since it had been over a year since I ate at the Cheesecake Factory, we thought it would be a good idea for dinner. If only we knew better... Appearance wise, the decor is great. Low, mood lighting, beautiful artwork on the ceilings and walls, marbled floors and columns are just a few of the intricate designs you will find in the restaurant. It is certainly a good place to take a date or your friends and family for a classier dinner, if all you're looking for is ambiance.  Our waitress for the night was friendly enough, but she seemed incredibly scattered. My sister had ordered a glass of Moscato and she failed to bring her the beverage at least 15 minutes after she had ordered it. When we needed her help, she was nowhere to be found and we had to wait for a good ten minutes before she finally came back. She was clearly a nice person, but as a waitress, left more to be desired. For our entrees, my sister ordered the spicy chicken chipotle pasta (extra spicy), my brother-in-law got the white chicken chili with white rice, and I chose the cajun jambalaya pasta.  When I read the description for my entree, I was super excited to dig into a dish that boasted spicy flavors, crunchy bell peppers, juicy chicken, and succulent shrimp on a bed of linguine pasta. What I got was a dish that lacked any sort of spice, aside from the aroma from the bell peppers, and linguine that was horribly bland. How can any entree called CAJUN JAMBALAYA be bland? Is that even possible? I couldn't believe how boring everything tasted!  My brother-in-law's dish looked like it was missing half of its portion, although if it was just going to be more of the hard, stale rice, I think he would say it wasn't much of a loss. My sister's pasta was definitely not spicy, let alone the extra spicy she had requested, and lacked a good amount of sauce as well.

1528,Jane Q.,"San Jose, United States",2,21,20.0,1.0,2016-01-03,"I've been to this specific location many times in the past but this review is about my visit last night. My boyfriend and I decided to stop by at this location to have a couple of drinks and order some salads. We arrived around 8 o'clock on February 29th. We sat at the bar.  Cheesecake factory makes really good Mojitos and just a few days ago I was at this location and ordered one and it was really good but the Mojito that I ordered last night wasn't that well done. My boyfriend ordered double gin and soda and he said it was good.  As for food I ordered the almond crusted salmon salad and I can't believe they were OK with serving me that gross tasting salmon. The salmon tasted old and it was cold. It took longer than the usual to have it served to us so I think they might have left it at the counter for a while until they picked it up to serve it.  Also,When I ordered my salad I asked for plate of bread which is the complementary bread that they serve to every customer but every time I stop by they automatically serve it,this time though I had to ask for it twice until I got it and the quality of the bread was pretty much the same as the salmon that I had on my salad, old and cold.  After taking two bites from the salmon I couldn't help but feel so grossed out by it so I pushed my plate to the side and our server asked if I wanted a box for my food and I had to tell him that it didn't taste god at all and the bread did not taste fresh. The server asked if I wanted to order something else off the menu , but worrying that somebody's going to spit in my food I didn't order anything else. It was disappointing and the server, even though he asked if I wanted something else, he didn't seem to care that my experience wasn't pleasant at all. Service wasn't special and food was gross. I don't think that's the general quality that's served here but it definitely wasn't good quality last night.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=400,3.0,3.14,3.12,2.6280000000000006,3.0840000000000005

Venue: It's pretty standard when it comes to all the other Cheesecake Factory locations I've been to - big enough to get a different table each time :) I always love the interior design of the restaurant. It's always so bright! Food: Their menu is really similar to BJ's- if you like anything from that menu, you will find its equivalent here. Plus there's around 16 pages of menu items. If you can't find something you like, you're being ridiculous. They have sooo much- my favorites are: -Parmesan Crusted Chicken -Chicken Marsala and Mushrooms -Lemon Garlic Shrimp -Steak Diane -Thai Glazed Salmon -Almost ALL the appetizers -ALL the cheesecakes of course Service: It always depends on your server and how busy it is but mostly, I've always had friendly, quick servers.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=160,2.96,3.13,3.108,3.216,3.062

She returned shortly with our drinks and only white bread, no wheat, she said they were out.  The food came quickly and it was delicious. The food was why I didn't leave one star.

The waitress was also friendly and helpful to us. When the garlic noodles came, I started to eat. Since the server didn't ask if any of us wanted parmesan cheese, the waiter came by and noticed that and offered to grate us some cheese. So attentive! After getting cheese, we all started eating. The garlic noodles were pretty good in my opinion but I would've loved a stronger garlic flavor. As for the rest of the party, I've also took nibbles of each dish. There was some other pasta dishes and a tamale dish. All of which was pretty good. Having finished our meal, we ordered cheesecake.  We had the anniversary cheesecake and the red velvet cheesecake. I liked the red velvet cheesecake way better. The anniversary cheesecake was a bit too chocolatey for me. If you LOVE chocolate, I think you'd like the anniversary cheesecake.

442,Jane Q.,"San Jose, CA",2,21,20.0,1.0,2016-03-01,"I've been to this specific location many times in the past but this review is about my visit last night. My boyfriend and I decided to stop by at this location to have a couple of drinks and order some salads. We arrived around 8 o'clock on February 29th. We sat at the bar.  Cheesecake factory makes really good Mojitos and just a few days ago I was at this location and ordered one and it was really good but the Mojito that I ordered last night wasn't that well done. My boyfriend ordered double gin and soda and he said it was good.  As for food I ordered the almond crusted salmon salad and I can't believe they were OK with serving me that gross tasting salmon. The salmon tasted old and it was cold. It took longer than the usual to have it served to us so I think they might have left it at the counter for a while until they picked it up to serve it.  Also,When I ordered my salad I asked for plate of bread which is the complementary bread that they serve to every customer but every time I stop by they automatically serve it,this time though I had to ask for it twice until I got it and the quality of the bread was pretty much the same as the salmon that I had on my salad, old and cold.  After taking two bites from the salmon I couldn't help but feel so grossed out by it so I pushed my plate to the side and our server asked if I wanted a box for my food and I had to tell him that it didn't taste god at all and the bread did not taste fresh.

This answer was not completely wrong cause it does have chocolate but turned out also coconut and walnuts. There was nothing wrong with the cashier's answer but I really expect that she could be more responsive and have said something such as ""this cake is mostly coconut"" or ""only the brown layer is chocolate cake"".

We simply had to throw it away.  - Everyone's Fav Pasta - is no one's favorite pasta. The pasta was uncooked! - Stuffed mushroom - was the only thing slightly edible They did not even include utensils. Seriously, for the price you pay, this is NOT the kind of crappy food you expect. Do they even do quality checks for to-go orders? It seems like they just make some crappy shit in a hurry and throw it out for customers.  This is easily the worst branch of Cheesecake factory.

We were told a 40 minute wait, which was understandable because it was busy, but at the 50 minute mark, I saw people that were not even waiting that long getting seated before us. I inquired how much longer and was told we were 4th in line just a few more minutes, well then as I watch I must've counted about 8 more parties getting seated before us, and they also didn't wait that long. I understand a party of 2 getting seated quicker, but I saw parties that were the same size as ours getting seated. When we checked again, we were given the same line of being 4th in line. The girl up front was telling everyone else that they were also 4th in line. This place is good but not worth the bad service.

Service: Service here is always very friendly and helpful.  Top notch servers with great knowledge of the menu and very helpful with any requests or questions you have.  Requests are taken care of quickly, water is always filled and you are checked on without being pestered too much throughout your meal.

Food - (my favorites) -   The complimentary sourdough and honeywheat bread is always good.

The sauce is amazing with the kick of spicyness. Govida chocolate cake - Make with no flour!! It is not too bitter and not overly sweet. Service - Despite how popular Cheesecake factory is and the long line of people waiting for their table, I am surprised that the wait for a party of 2-4 is usually less than a 30 minute wait. Even if it was 1 hour long, I might still be willing to wait for a table. Staff is always friendly and makes sure you are satifsifed with your meal. I came to this locations serveral times.

The food arrived cold and tasted crap.  - Mac and cheese balls - someone had added salt twice! It was totally unpalatable. We simply had to throw it away.  - Everyone's Fav Pasta - is no one's favorite pasta. The pasta was uncooked! - Stuffed mushroom - was the only thing slightly edible They did not even include utensils. Seriously, for the price you pay, this is NOT the kind of crappy food you expect. Do they even do quality checks for to-go orders? It seems like they just make some crappy shit in a hurry and throw it out for customers.  This is easily the worst branch of Cheesecake factory.

I pointed the Chris Outrages Cheese Cake and asked: ""Is this chocolate."" The cashier said: ''yes it has chocolate."" This answer was not completely wrong cause it does have chocolate but turned out also coconut and walnuts. There was nothing wrong with the cashier's answer but I really expect that she could be more responsive and have said something such as ""this cake is mostly coconut"" or ""only the brown layer is chocolate cake"". I did not pursue my question so I ended up with a nutty coconut cake, which I ""kindly shared"" to a friend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=280,3.0,3.01,3.124,2.536,3.006

As other reviewers have stated it took 40+ minutes to get my entree at 10:30 PM with a not very crowded restaurant. The food was average at best.  I ordered a cheesecake and mistakenly didn't know that a whole cake came in different sizes. The waitress charges me the most expensive $55.00 cake and didn't ask what size I wanted upon taking my order. I understand that I should have checked that, but as a waitress I would have expected her to ask ""what size would you like?"" Instead of charging me for the most expensive cake. I have a feeling the back of house is very unorganised and communication is lacking.  All in all I do not plan to eat here again. Pretty sad considering most of the cheesecakes I've eaten at have been pretty decent.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=260,3.32,3.1,3.104,2.056,3.1880000000000006

213,Jessica R.,"Fremont, CA",41,6,,5.0,2016-08-02,Celebrated my Birthday here. Our server was excellent really friendly and professional. I ordered the White Chicken Chili which was delicious. To drink I had the Georgia Peach cocktail which was really yummy. We ordered the Avocado Egg Rolls appetizers which is one of my favorite dishes - love the cilantro peanut sauce. I've received exceptional service each time I've been here whether I sit at the bar or get a table. This is one of my favorite Cheesecake locations I always recommend this location when friends want to go to Cheesecake factory. I picked out the Dulce de Leche Cheesecake for desert which is my second favorite cheesecake here now. They decorated my cheesecake for my birthday which was a nice touch.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=340,2.24,2.81,2.98,2.9640000000000004,2.5820000000000007

My favorite dishes include the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad, practically not even a salad though, it's packed with so much delicious ingredients, the lunch portion is a heaping amount.

Took 40 minutes for the order. They forgot my sauce so I had to wait an additional 15 minutes for the sauce. They never asked if I wanted bread to go and I've seen them ask everyone else. No utensils either. What I ordered: Miso salmon: bland and ok. I had this a few times and it did not taste good  Kale salad: it came out very warm. They put the salad on the bottom on the bag and so my salad was cooking. Gross. If I wanted a warm meal, I would have ordered something hot, but I ordered a salad and it was so warm. This was my mom's dinner. Horrible!  Eggplant Parmesan: pasta was so dry. It was all stuck to eat other. I was able to pick up the clump of pasta with a small fork. It was so hard. Banana cheesecake: it feel apart before I was able to take it home. Overall, very disappointed.

Service: Service here is always very friendly and helpful.  Top notch servers with great knowledge of the menu and very helpful with any requests or questions you have.  Requests are taken care of quickly, water is always filled and you are checked on without being pestered too much throughout your meal. Overall Experience:  I recommend Cheesecake Factory to anyone looking for a solid option whether its brunch, lunch or dinner.  Great staff, great food and great ambiance make for a good meal every time I visit.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=320,2.4,2.8,2.98,2.8000000000000003,2.64

2784,Laure S.,"Upland, CA",0,56,8.0,2.0,2016-08-07,"Probably the worst Cheesecake Factory I have visited thus far. I ordered the fried mac and cheese balls that were practically frozen in the middle. I had them remade for a second time only to have the same issue. Waitress didn't offer to remove it off the bill nor really seemed to know how to alleviate the problem.  As other reviewers have stated it took 40+ minutes to get my entree at 10:30 PM with a not very crowded restaurant. The food was average at best.  I ordered a cheesecake and mistakenly didn't know that a whole cake came in different sizes. The waitress charges me the most expensive $55.00 cake and didn't ask what size I wanted upon taking my order. I understand that I should have checked that, but as a waitress I would have expected her to ask ""what size would you like?"" Instead of charging me for the most expensive cake. I have a feeling the back of house is very unorganised and communication is lacking.  All in all I do not plan to eat here again.

The waitress was also friendly and helpful to us. When the garlic noodles came, I started to eat. Since the server didn't ask if any of us wanted parmesan cheese, the waiter came by and noticed that and offered to grate us some cheese. So attentive! After getting cheese, we all started eating. The garlic noodles were pretty good in my opinion but I would've loved a stronger garlic flavor. As for the rest of the party, I've also took nibbles of each dish. There was some other pasta dishes and a tamale dish. All of which was pretty good. Having finished our meal, we ordered cheesecake.  We had the anniversary cheesecake and the red velvet cheesecake. I liked the red velvet cheesecake way better. The anniversary cheesecake was a bit too chocolatey for me. If you LOVE chocolate, I think you'd like the anniversary cheesecake.

That was four weeks ago (I assumed it would come in 1-2 days) and still no card. And even getting him to make that gesture in the first place was like pulling teeth.  I have had Eureka in Cupertino or Town in San Carlos make mistakes and they do not hesitate to make it right. And I have been back to those restaurants again and again and again.  Restaurant Managing 101 isn't it? If you make a mistake, take responsibility and keep your customers. Responding to Yelp reviews and making empty promises about improved service next time is NOT taking responsibility for your screwups.  I'd call it ""for show"" damage control.

On the upside, across the restaurant is a designated parking lot area just for the Cheesecake Factory.  It's not very large, but better to have than not.

The staff was very friendly and they work really hard.  Yes, you have to wait sometimes to get their attention as they zip by passing your table. Rather than wait to order dessert we thought it would be faster to just go up to the take-out counter. Wrong!  There was a line for that as well. It wasn't too bad but after placing our order it's placed into the queue between desserts ordered for dine-in and take out.  It would have been faster if I went behind the counter and retrieved it myself.   The White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Cheesecake was worth the wait.  Can't say the same for the Banana Cream Cheesecake.

We had a party of 5 people. It was a 45 min wait. It was fine. We understood. Saturday night. it was poppin. When we got to the front desk... we missed our window to grab the table by 5 mins. They put us back into the queue. Told us we had to wait another 20mins. After a while we  go up to the counter to check if we were up next. They said they already called our name when we were literally standing in front of the host/hostess desk. We continue to wait 10+ mins before we get seated.  Putting aside the long wait..it was time to order. I ordered the Crispy Shrimp Sandwich. After a long ass time... the food begins to come out. They hand me a crispy chicken sandwich...and i say nope. i didnt order this. As any consumer, you just immediately realize that if this is the sandwich that made for you... they are going to have to start from scratch and make it again. It's going to take forever. But again... things happen... so as the others eat... I wait for my sandwich to come. What's odd is that I understood why i had not gotten my food. But my friend who ordered a Cuban sandwich ALSO hadn't gotten his food neither. With no explanation to WHY he hadn't gotten his food.. we were both left waiting. My food finally comes out after another 20 mins. It's now 8:30. My crispy shrimp sandwich arrives. But WHERE WAS THE CUBAN SANDWICH?! But the best part about it was, WITHOUT any explanation, his sweet potato fries came out without the Cuban sandwich. I guess it was still lagging behind LOL. It was 8:40pm when the sandwich finally decided to come out. 3 other people at the table had finished their meals when we took our first bite.  I was waiting to the end of the meal before I started to rating this meal to see if the waiter or the manager or anyone working at cheesecake was going to do anything for our inconvenience. I understand mistake happens. I understand when it gets busy... people get flustered and even drop the ball from time to time. And that is perfectly okay. It is ALWAYS about how you treat the customer and making a bad situation into a better one. But NOPE... NOPE...NOPE...NOPE.  Our waitress said sorry probably like 10 times but that does nothing for our meal. It wasn't completely her fault. It was the entire crew at Cheesecake. I am a huge fan of this place. It is just disappointing that I was looking forward to eating here and this is what we get....  Overall stats: waited over an hour before getting seated. took over an hour to get everyone's food. People already finished eating before the last person got their dish. Where was the manager? Would have been nice if he/she came over to make sure all the customers are satisfied but hey... ""Cheesecake was probably busy"" ""there were probably another issue he/she had to take care of.""

On the upside, across the restaurant is a designated parking lot area just for the Cheesecake Factory.  It's not very large, but better to have than not. My usual is the Miso Salmon, it never disappoints, well at least it hasn't so far.  My husband's usual favorite is the Shrimp Scampi.  However, this time round he said it was a little overcooked. The staff was very friendly and they work really hard.  Yes, you have to wait sometimes to get their attention as they zip by passing your table. Rather than wait to order dessert we thought it would be faster to just go up to the take-out counter. Wrong!  There was a line for that as well. It wasn't too bad but after placing our order it's placed into the queue between desserts ordered for dine-in and take out.  It would have been faster if I went behind the counter and retrieved it myself.   The White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Cheesecake was worth the wait.  Can't say the same for the Banana Cream Cheesecake.  The restaurant is family friendly and it's not a quiet restaurant.  So kids can talk loud, laugh or cry and adults near the bar area can watch sports and cheer on their team.

We had a party of 5 people. It was a 45 min wait. It was fine. We understood. Saturday night. it was poppin. When we got to the front desk... we missed our window to grab the table by 5 mins. They put us back into the queue. Told us we had to wait another 20mins. After a while we  go up to the counter to check if we were up next. They said they already called our name when we were literally standing in front of the host/hostess desk. We continue to wait 10+ mins before we get seated.  Putting aside the long wait..it was time to order. I ordered the Crispy Shrimp Sandwich. After a long ass time... the food begins to come out. They hand me a crispy chicken sandwich...and i say nope. i didnt order this. As any consumer, you just immediately realize that if this is the sandwich that made for you... they are going to have to start from scratch and make it again. It's going to take forever. But again... things happen... so as the others eat... I wait for my sandwich to come. What's odd is that I understood why i had not gotten my food. But my friend who ordered a Cuban sandwich ALSO hadn't gotten his food neither. With no explanation to WHY he hadn't gotten his food.. we were both left waiting. My food finally comes out after another 20 mins. It's now 8:30. My crispy shrimp sandwich arrives. But WHERE WAS THE CUBAN SANDWICH?! But the best part about it was, WITHOUT any explanation, his sweet potato fries came out without the Cuban sandwich. I guess it was still lagging behind LOL. It was 8:40pm when the sandwich finally decided to come out. 3 other people at the table had finished their meals when we took our first bite.  I was waiting to the end of the meal before I started to rating this meal to see if the waiter or the manager or anyone working at cheesecake was going to do anything for our inconvenience. I understand mistake happens. I understand when it gets busy... people get flustered and even drop the ball from time to time. And that is perfectly okay. It is ALWAYS about how you treat the customer and making a bad situation into a better one. But NOPE... NOPE...NOPE...NOPE.  Our waitress said sorry probably like 10 times but that does nothing for our meal. It wasn't completely her fault. It was the entire crew at Cheesecake. I am a huge fan of this place. It is just disappointing that I was looking forward to eating here and this is what we get....  Overall stats: waited over an hour before getting seated. took over an hour to get everyone's food. People already finished eating before the last person got their dish. Where was the manager? Would have been nice if he/she came over to make sure all the customers are satisfied but hey... ""Cheesecake was probably busy"" ""there were probably another issue he/she had to take care of.""

Krystal should have handle the situation professionally which she didn't and we were highly offended which in turn had us walking away.

Came in at 11:30pm and I ordered stuffed mushroom for appetizer and she informed me (with a very good attitude) that they're out of stuffed mushrooms and asked for my second choice. Jokingly, I said that I had my heart set on them.. she came back minutes later to let us know that the chef is making us stuffed mushrooms from scratch. Wow! You don't often get that kind of service from well known/successful restaurants. She was also very polite with a positive attitude for the rest of the time we were there. Awesome food as always, fresh warm bread, excellent cheesecakes. Giving this location a 4 instead of 5 because of parking. Due to the construction around it, parking in front of cheesecake was $6 so you're better off going to the mall parking lot.

Very bad time for him to go on break! Our steak was cooked medium when we asked for well done and it came as cold. There was a dark red hue in the steak where we expected 0 coloration. We ordered our desert at the same time as our entrees but our server apparently didn't log that in as he offered desert ideas to us while we were still eating.

2935,Shannon W.,"Cupertino, United States",1664,159,490.0,2.0,2017-01-07,"This Cheesecake Factory is located in Westfield Valley Fair in West San Jose, next to Macy's mens. We came on a Saturday for lunch at 1pm, and got seated within 5 minutes. The hostess was very nice! We got the crab cake appetizer ($13) and factory combo: herb crusted salmon and filet mignon with mashed potatoes ($22.50). The food came pretty fast, around 15-20 minutes. However, I didn't have a great experience for the value. For a lunch costing a total of $45 for 2, with only one appetizer and one entree, it was VERY little food.  The crabcakes appetizer comes with THREE crabcakes, with like a 2 inch diameter, tiny!! The two sauces were great, but it's not proportional to the amount of crabcake they gave! Delicious, but really not worth it.  The salmon and filet mignon pieces were also extremely small. The salmon was like 2x4 inches, and not incredibly good. The filet mignon was 3 small, thin pieces.. They didn't skimp on the mashed potato though. Gave an awful lot of that. But that's not worth $23 is it.  Also, I really like the wheat grain bread at the Cheesecake chains. So the first waiter for 1 wheat grain and 1 sourdough bread, and my friend and I finished that. so we asked for some more wheat grain bread, and it took 25 minutes for that to come out. We finally got to eat some bread.. after we finished our meal. It also took a really long time to flag someone down and give us a check.  This place has the decor, good location, and fine food, but the portions are incredibly skimpish and the service is lacking.

Food was good aside from the fact our order got mixed up in the takeout line and we pushed back. We ended up waiting for like 40 minutes for our food even though our server kept saying it'll be just a few minutes. I'd say it's one of my pet peeves when people over promise and under deliver so I was annoyed.

2999,zahra b.,"San Francisco, United States",287,54,2.0,1.0,2017-01-08,"Woah. I just had one of my worst restaurant experiences ever here. A few friends decided to come out together for their July 31 cheesecake special. We arrived at 8:30pm and were told the wait would be 60-75 minutes long. No problem. We were seated at approximately 9:30pm. We came for the cheesecake special! It was advertised on their website, signage, etc. So place our orders, with some for dine in, which we assume will be on the special and some to go, which we assume will be full price. However, the waitress tells us we need to order entres to get the cheesecake discount. Except that's not anywhere in the marketing or fine print. She insists it is. One of the girls had been there the night before and says she wasn't required to do the same last night. The waitress says it was a mistake. We ask about all of the other people who have been in line and are there as it doesn't appear they are all ordering entres. The waitress says some of the other staff may be unfamiliar with the rules and undercharging people. We ask her to check with her manager.  She does. Her narrative stays the same. Entres are required. The sign at the door says it. I go look at the sign. It matches what corporate has on the site. One per person. Dine in only. Nothing about a required entre. We ask to see the manager.  The manager comes out. He apologizes and says he understands we have been waiting and will give us the 1/2 price cheesecakes. We ask about the confusion and he explains the wait staff were asked to encourage people to order entres to minimize the lines.  What in the world? Encourage and require are two very different things. Not to mention the lying about the posters and other people's orders.  Ok. We're all set. Cheesecakes were ordered nearly 30 minutes ago, pricing issues have been cleared up, and maybe we will enjoy the rest of the night? No.  10 more minutes go by and we still don't have our cheesecakes. One of the girls asks the waitress. Oops. Between the waitress and the manager and clarifying the misrepresentation about the promotion's requirements, they forgot to actually place the order.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=80,3.28,3.0,2.884,2.02,3.1120000000000005

When we sat we ordered water and got bread, but it took a long time for that to come out. The place was also fairly cold, which I thought was weird.  We finally ordered, and our food took 45 minutes to come out. We were anticipating our food, and kept looking around for our waitress, only to see that people sitting around us that had arrived later on got their food before we did. Our waitress passed by and I asked if she could check on our food. Right after she left she came back with our food.  Everything was good, but it definitely was not worth the wait. We asked for boxes once we were full, and that also took about 20 minutes for our waitress to bring out. We wanted to leave and go to the mall after, so we asked another waiter to give us boxes.

2514,Liz C.,"Santa Clara, CA",431,506,2328.0,3.0,2017-02-05,"I know Cheesecake Factory always gets mediocre reviews but for some reason I keep coming back. It's not like the food is phenomenal, but it's oddly comforting. I came to this specific location for my birthday with my significant other. It was a Friday night and crazy busy as you would expect. They told us it would be about 25 minutes for a booth to open up. We waited like the rest of the crowd. Once our buzzer started ringing, we were seated. If you didn't already know, Cheesecake Factory has a huge, huge menu. Furthermore, their portion sizing here is no joke. Appetizers are the size of full entrees and entrees could probably  feed two mouths. Since it was my birthday, we decide to do a bit of splurging. We wanted the tuna carpaccio but they were unfortunately out of tuna for the night. We decided to go with the buffalo blasts and the calamari to start.  The buffalo blasts are really interesting. I have never had anything like it and it's pretty hard to describe. They are deep fried to the point where they almost taste like fried chicken on the outside. They are inside what seems like a wonton wrapper and the inside is a buffalo chicken, cheese mix. It's soft and squishy on the inside but extra crunchy on the outside. It comes with blue cheese dip but my s/o and I thought ranch would be better so we kindly asked our server for some.  The calamari is pretty standard. I think there is so much breading on the calamari that you can barely taste the seafood. Thankfully, the outside is pretty crunchy. Some places don't know how to make calamari crunchy on the outside so it ends up being squishy.  We wanted to take leftovers home so ended up ordering two entree sized pastas (way too much food). I ordered the Louisiana chicken pasta while my s/o chose the jambalaya cajun pasta. I actually really like the Louisiana chicken pasta. The bow tie pasta is smothered in creamy sauce and the chicken is breaded thinly. It was my first time trying the jambalaya cajun pasta and it was underwhelming. I actually think it had barely any flavor at all. The sauce was pretty tasteless unless your bite had a bit of the sausage, shrimp and veggies. I personally just didn't really like this one. It didn't even gain any more flavor after sitting in the fridge overnight (which you would think would allow the flavors to sit some more). I ordered the 30th anniversary cheesecake to-go because there was no way we would be able to fill our stomach anymore. This cheesecake is a mix of fudge cake and original cheesecake in one piece. It was the perfect thing for me because I wanted cake for my birthday, but also was craving cheesecake. It's super rich and indulgent of course, but that's my kind of treat! The server came over with a couple other servers and sang me Happy Birthday and had other tables join in. I never told my server how old I was turning, but he thought I was turning 21. I guess this birthday I lost years in my age! None the less, I appreciated that they came and sang for me and gave a complimentary mousse type thing with a candle even though it was so, so busy. Because it was so busy, service was a bit slow but we were still checked up on here and there and had our needs met.  Overall - not bad. I still enjoy coming here with my s/o to indulge and of course, get dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=40,2.64,2.88,2.9,1.7400000000000002,2.7840000000000003

We recently moved to San Jose CA and  went to the restaurant at Westfield Mall on Steven's Creek Rd.  It was so disappointing. We waited over 45 mins for our food so we had to take it to go. My husband ordered a chicken Parmesan sandwich which had no tomato sauce on it and the waiter said the fries weren't ready.  We thought we would give the restaurant another try using their curbside service.  Again we ordered the chicken Parmesan sandwich and another entree. When we arrived at the curbside parking I called their number which rang for 5 mins and I was then transferred to the bakery and held for 4 mins and was hung up on. My husband then went inside and waited in line for our order.  And yet again- no sauce on the sandwich. He then talked to the manager who simply said - sorry.  The service here is horrible and I would really discourage anyone from going to this particular location.  They truly create a horrible experience for this otherwise very reputable restaurant brand.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=360,2.4,2.86,2.844,1.4760000000000002,2.676

The Bang Bang they to-go'ed for us since we opted for cheesecake - nutella hazelnut and red velvet. Honestly, I think the cakes are a bit overpriced and overly sweet. I typically go for a little bit lighter on the sweets but keep the richness of the cheese. By the time we got out, we had spent 3 hours in that restaurant despite the kind waiter letting us know how crazy it was and apologizing profusely for everything (we did end up getting one of the cheesecakes for free). As we were leaving, still a ridiculous line with people looking tired for having waited...

I called to place a Curbside order at appx 920 pm.  This was for the Valley Fair mall, Santa Clara location.  I was on hold for eleven minutes before someone answered.  I placed my order.   I arrived at the location immediately, they came out and I paid in cash.   Obviously it's the end of the dinner rush and Chzcake is a busy restaurant so I understood that it would take time for my order.  But 20 minutes passed.  Then 30.  Then 40.  Then 45.   47 minutes passed before I finally lost my patience and called in.  I told the hostess who answered the phone that I had been waiting over 45 minutes for my food.  She said she would get me to someone in bakery right away.  I was on hold for six minutes and no one picked up.   At this point, I was about to simply leave but realized that I had already paid.  And tipped!  I called back, the same hostess answered the phone and she told me she would get someone right away.  Someone at the bakery picked up and said they would bring the food right out. When I received the food, it was clearly evident that the pasta had been sitting for some time, as the food (which is covered inside of a box designed to stay hot) was slightly less than lukewarm.  I told the guy to just give me my money back. He went in and out came the manager.  Her name was Samantha Zaragoza (sp.?).  She handed me my cash.  Her words to me verbatim: ""Sir, your order tonight was $31, here's your cash-- did you need anything else tonight?"" I kind of wanted to say, ""Yes, my food, hot as it should be, delivered on time, without having to hold for a combination of over 15 minutes on the phone please :)"" but instead I decided to just leave. Cheesecake Factory is busy.  I get it. But it's a public company with a mission statement that is literally ""to create an environment where absolute guest satisfaction is our highest priority!"" I don't care what your labor cost is.  I don't care what your food cost is.  Hire more people.  Schedule more employees.  Find GMs that do not stand for this type of service and train managers to find solutions rather than being disappointing AND having no solution for an upset customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=80,2.56,2.53,2.76,1.5400000000000003,2.542
2516,Dang L.,"San Jose, CA",8,132,183.0,2.0,2017-03-12,"We came here on a Friday night. Paid for the valet parking lot because there wasn't anywhere to park. When we got in at 730pm, there was a 40-50 minute wait. I had predicted this would happen, but the hubby had insisted. These two issues wouldn't have bothered me so much as the rest of my experience all cumulated.  We got seated and it took 15 minutes for our waiter to come by. We ordered. He was supposed to come back with drinks. Got the bread. 10 minutes, water and appetizer. Still waiting for the drinks. Waiter said he was going to bring it over. 5minutes later he brought one drink and said he was going to come back with the other drinks. Waited another 15 minutes. Got the food. Still. I drink. Half way through the meal he checked on us. We asked for the drink and they finally bought it. I realize it's busy but still. Now after venting: Mac and cheese ball - 4 stars. Probably the best dish of the night. Although is quite salty, the creamy tomato dish takes it to another level.  Sirloin with mash potatoes and veggies- 2.5. The hubby ordered well done. It came between medium and rare. But too hungry so he ate it anyways but left about 1/3. Because it was too rare for him. Mash potato- standard although on the saltier side.  Clam chowder - 3 stars. Good but nothing outstanding to rave about.  Steak tacos- comes with 3 tacos, beans & rice. Topped with chopped onions, salsa, guacamole and cilantro. Pretty decent but I didn't like the fact that it tasted sweet with a lingering after taste. Will not order again. - should be mostly savory for a taco.  Greek salad- 1 star. Mostly leafy greens with 2 olives and a couple if tomato and cucumber slices. It literally had no taste except the saltiness  of the feta. Had to ask for a dressing - balsamic. Then it was better. I was told they did toss it in a dressing.  Over all the low stars for the service and disappointed food prep. Maybe going on busy hour may not be a good idea. But I've been to 5 different cheese cakes factory throughout California and have eaten here before too.

It's a long, skinny piece of salmon wrapped in a thin won ton wrapper. Only the sauce has some hint of ""spice"" in the most literal sense of the word, so you don't have to be worried about any explosions. There's a refreshing red cabbage slaw that's tossed lightly with some light dressing on the side. It was a tasty dish and a nice change from any old spring roll. 3. Bistro Shrimp Pasta - This was on the menu at a whopping 2100 calories. Fried shrimp, garlic cream sauce...mmm it was worth every single calorie. It's an enormous portion which is what must account for part of its delicious unhealthiness. 4. Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch Cheesecake - I swear they make you wait for your table so you have to ogle all the cheesecakes in all their glory in the front. There's no way you can say no to dessert after looking in the display case. If you enjoy Ferrero Rochers, you would love this cheesecake.

Multibillion corporation, you'd think they'd give they're chefs some cooking lessons. Uncooked pasta can make one very sick. Food and service was horrible. Took us nearly an hour just to get the check and another hour just so she can pick up the check. It died down around 8:30 and we were still receiving bad service. Hope you guys retrain the servers.

After I got their Yelp response:  1st thing I did:  I went to their site link, inputted a message that they wanted to talk to me, provided my # for them to call.  Later, I got a call from a guy from corporate who was very nice and seemed genuine in passing the message onto the real guy who is in the ""Investigation Dept"" (who was out of the office on time off).  A few weeks went by, nothing.  2nd thing I did:  I called back to corporate and asked to talked to this ""guy"" in the Investigation dept. He didn't seemed to know of my story (perhaps it was never communicated to him) and came off flustered.

Finally we ordered.  I had chicken madeira.  My three dining partners had jambalaya pasta, salmon and hibachi steak.  The drinks and appetizers came quickly.  The dynamite shrimp were tiny fried shrimp with some slightly spicy dipping sauce.  Meh.  The Cuban rolls were an egg roll cut in half, stuffed with shredded pork, ham, melted cheese and some pickle-mustard sauce.  Cuban sandwich fillings in an eggroll?  Some fusion is bomb, this was a bit of a dud.  Not bad but not fantastic. Our main courses took a long long time.  I'm sure it's hard for the kitchen to support such a large menu.  So many things to cook.  My chicken madeira was burnt on the bottom, not charred, burnt.  It took me a few bites to get past that, but he sauce was decent.  My dining partners all reported that their entrees were ""ok."" We all ordered cheesecake to go.  I had my strawberry cheesecake later that night and it was super good. The Cheesecake Factory can be great, depending on what you order and who cooks it, but it can also be just ok.  I've never had a bad meal here, but it seldom blows me away.  The wide selection is great for groups with picky eaters because there is literally something for everyone.  However that large menu comes at a price.  They don't master it all.  Still, it's worth the occasional visit, especially for dessert.  I have never had a bad cheesecake here.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2,2.2,2.04,2.516,2.572,2.104

2954,Liz C.,"Santa Clara, United States",431,506,2328.0,3.0,2017-05-02,"I know Cheesecake Factory always gets mediocre reviews but for some reason I keep coming back. It's not like the food is phenomenal, but it's oddly comforting. I came to this specific location for my birthday with my significant other. It was a Friday night and crazy busy as you would expect. They told us it would be about 25 minutes for a booth to open up. We waited like the rest of the crowd. Once our buzzer started ringing, we were seated. If you didn't already know, Cheesecake Factory has a huge, huge menu. Furthermore, their portion sizing here is no joke. Appetizers are the size of full entrees and entrees could probably  feed two mouths. Since it was my birthday, we decide to do a bit of splurging. We wanted the tuna carpaccio but they were unfortunately out of tuna for the night. We decided to go with the buffalo blasts and the calamari to start.  The buffalo blasts are really interesting. I have never had anything like it and it's pretty hard to describe. They are deep fried to the point where they almost taste like fried chicken on the outside. They are inside what seems like a wonton wrapper and the inside is a buffalo chicken, cheese mix. It's soft and squishy on the inside but extra crunchy on the outside. It comes with blue cheese dip but my s/o and I thought ranch would be better so we kindly asked our server for some.  The calamari is pretty standard. I think there is so much breading on the calamari that you can barely taste the seafood. Thankfully, the outside is pretty crunchy. Some places don't know how to make calamari crunchy on the outside so it ends up being squishy.  We wanted to take leftovers home so ended up ordering two entree sized pastas (way too much food). I ordered the Louisiana chicken pasta while my s/o chose the jambalaya cajun pasta. I actually really like the Louisiana chicken pasta. The bow tie pasta is smothered in creamy sauce and the chicken is breaded thinly. It was my first time trying the jambalaya cajun pasta and it was underwhelming. I actually think it had barely any flavor at all. The sauce was pretty tasteless unless your bite had a bit of the sausage, shrimp and veggies. I personally just didn't really like this one. It didn't even gain any more flavor after sitting in the fridge overnight (which you would think would allow the flavors to sit some more). I ordered the 30th anniversary cheesecake to-go because there was no way we would be able to fill our stomach anymore. This cheesecake is a mix of fudge cake and original cheesecake in one piece. It was the perfect thing for me because I wanted cake for my birthday, but also was craving cheesecake. It's super rich and indulgent of course, but that's my kind of treat! The server came over with a couple other servers and sang me Happy Birthday and had other tables join in. I never told my server how old I was turning, but he thought I was turning 21. I guess this birthday I lost years in my age! None the less, I appreciated that they came and sang for me and gave a complimentary mousse type thing with a candle even though it was so, so busy. Because it was so busy, service was a bit slow but we were still checked up on here and there and had our needs met.  Overall - not bad. I still enjoy coming here with my s/o to indulge and of course, get dessert.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=40,2.8,2.29,2.552,2.508,2.494

I order the Ahi Tuna Tataki Salad and Chipotle Chicken Pasta everytime I come.  Chipotle Chicken Pasta 5/5 Ahi Tuna Tataki Salad 5/5 Warm Crab and Artichoke Dip 4/5 Bread 5/5 Food overall is great! Service however was 2/5 for my most recent experience dining here. I ordered 2 Ahi Tuna Tataki Salads and was delivered two plates of Seared Ahi Tuna on rice. My family and I were extremely understanding of the miscommunication since there are a couple dishes that contain ""Ahi Tuna."" The manager apologized for the mix-up and took the appetizer off our bill. The Ahi salad and chipotle pasta again were amazing. However, our server not only blamed me for speaking too low while ordering but also quickly reduced her quality of service for the rest of the evening. I'm not too sure if I'll be back at this location.

My mom and dad didn't get their food until 15 minutes later. Our waitress explained that someone ""stole"" my dad's shrimp and sausage pasta that's why they had to remake it.

After a random adventure around the mall, the husband and I rewarded ourselves with a ""small"" lunch at The Cheesecake Factory (I say ""small"" because anyone who's ever been here knows none of their portions are small) We had the pleasure of having Greg as our server who had a great energy, good suggestions for our meal, and made great conversation. We've had a recent history of some not so great restaurant servers so it was very refreshing!  Unfortunately, they were out of the ""Pizza-Style"" Chicken parmesan, but we were very pleased with our second choice of Pineapple crusted chicken and shrimp dish. We split this and ended the meal with Adam's Peanut Butter pie. Holy richness! I love oreo cookie crust but was so happy we split this - I needed to be carried out afterward.

All this for some cake.  Granted it's a bday cake but, still. Tried to order the bone in ribeye (but received the rib eye) as well as the filet mignon. Both were pretty tasty and seasoned well. They both kept up to the medium rare request. Sides were a standard mashed potatoes and green beans. A little lack luster with little to no seasoning but, they're just fillers anyway. At least it was kind of healthy. And lastly, the salted caramel was really good. Maybe I should've ordered the cake instead of a slice.

3048,Jennifer D.,"Felton, United States",1,5,,2.0,2017-05-15,"If you would have asked me before last night to rate this restaurant, I would have given it 4-5 stars. My family and I usually come here about once a month with a fairly large group, around 7-9 people, and have never really had any issues until now.  We came here last night for Mothers day dinner. It was busy when we arrived, but not overly so. Wait time was about an hour, which was fine because we knew there would be a wait on a holiday and we were able to kill time in the mall before heading to dinner. The problems started after we ordered our food. We were visited by two different managers at our table before our food even showed up to apologize for the wait, which we thought was odd since we didn't feel the wait was excessive at that point. It just seemed average for a weekend dinner here. When the food arrived at our table, one of the entrees was wrong. We promptly notified the person who brought the food out to the table (who wasn't our server) and they said they would fix it right away. Fair enough. Our server then came to the table, apologized for the mix up and said the correct entree would be out in about 5-7 minutes.  We waited another couple of minutes and the ""new"" entree comes out to the table. The supposed ""new"" entree ended up being the exact same plate of food they had sent out earlier, which was wrong. We told them again that it was wrong, they apologized again, and again they said they would correct it. At this point, one person at our table still did not have their food, Our waitress seemed to have disappeared and the correct entree still had not been brought out yet. We waited about 15 minutes and tried to flag someone down to figure out what was going on. You would think that it would have been easy to flag down a manager since two of them had already been to our table, but they were nowhere to be found at that point. Neither was our waitress. We ended up flagging down a server from another table and asked to speak with a manager. At this point a third manager comes out. I believe his name was Justin. We explain what was going on. At this point, those of us who got our food were pretty much done eating and the corrected entree never came out. He apologized and offered us a couple free deserts. We reluctantly agreed. Several minutes later and no server had taken our dessert order. We finally found out from the manager that he had switched our server without telling us, since he thought that we had an issue with the first one. It wasn't really her that was the issue, it was the kitchen staff, but ok. If you are going to give us another server, why wouldn't you tell us so we know who is going to be taking our order? At this point we were fed up and one of us was still hungry since he never received his correct food. They offered to box it up for us to go, but we were just so frustrated at this point that we wanted nothing more to do with this restaurant. We decided to skip dessert, which I had been looking forward to all day. It surprises me that on such a busy day with so many ""managers"" floating around the restaurant that our service was so terrible.

3087,Chaz C.,"Santa Clara, United States",5,13,1.0,2.0,2017-05-30,We went to the this location for my birthday dinner. I mentioned that it was my birthday and the waiter acknowledged. When ordering our food we asked if our food could come out with the appetizers and not to wait for the appetizers to come out and then do the food he must have forgot that because our food came out a while after the appetizers were finished. The waiter was a little forgetful. When my wife entree came which was salmon with broccoli the broccoli had yellow flowers on it and there was brown spots also. We asked to see the manager and Jason came. He tried to explain that the broccoli was just fine and I showed him and told him that the the broccoli had brown spots he told me no it's yellow and I said no sir it is not yellow it's over right and it has lost a lot of it nutrients. He offered to go back to the kitchen and have some new broccoli made up that was more presentable when it came out it was overcooked and it still had brown spots on it. He also told me that they accepted the order of overripe broccoli.  The next issue which is a little more disconcerting is that during my meal I had fruit flies flying around our booth first there was just one and then by the end of the meal there was 4 of them flying around the window and then there was a dead one on the windowsill. Kind of makes you wonder how clean the restaurant is when they have fruit flies flying around. Oh and to top it all off they forgot my birthday oh well at least my hamburger was okay and my son like this spaghetti but we will probably not be visiting that location again because of the fruit flies and the lack of compassion from the manager Jason 5/31 Corporate called me and they were very nice apologetic.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=120,2.64,2.4,2.528,2.504,2.496

The food itself took around 30 minutes or more. The waiter David was friendly. He gave us automatic refills. He also conveniently offered the cheesecake menu to us after our meal.

They're great for accommodating big parties, so I'll give them that. But in terms of their food, I'd much rather eat elsewhere.  We got here a little before 6:00 PM on a Sunday (after a failed attempt to eat at Din Tai Fung, which had an estimated 2 hour wait time - yikes!!), and we only waited about 5 minutes to be seated.

Strike #2: My dad ordered an omelette, which was offered with a side of potatoes or tomatoes. He went with tomatoes, and when the dish was delivered, there were no tomatoes. He had to ask about it, and our server eventually brought it out for him after. Strike #3: My brother ordered the factory combination with Steak Diane and Chicken Madeira. And there was a piece of plain cooked pasta in his dish when his order clearly had no pasta items. Seems like sloppy food service or poor quality control to me... And lastly, I ordered pasta with shrimp and sausage, which was just average.  DESSERT: How could you come to The Cheesecake Factory and not get a slice of cheesecake?

We ended up waiting for like 40 minutes for our food even though our server kept saying it'll be just a few minutes.

We came on a Saturday for lunch at 1pm, and got seated within 5 minutes. The hostess was very nice! We got the crab cake appetizer ($13) and factory combo: herb crusted salmon and filet mignon with mashed potatoes ($22.50). The food came pretty fast, around 15-20 minutes. However, I didn't have a great experience for the value. For a lunch costing a total of $45 for 2, with only one appetizer and one entree, it was VERY little food.  The crabcakes appetizer comes with THREE crabcakes, with like a 2 inch diameter, tiny!! The two sauces were great, but it's not proportional to the amount of crabcake they gave! Delicious, but really not worth it.  The salmon and filet mignon pieces were also extremely small. The salmon was like 2x4 inches, and not incredibly good. The filet mignon was 3 small, thin pieces.. They didn't skimp on the mashed potato though. Gave an awful lot of that. But that's not worth $23 is it.  Also, I really like the wheat grain bread at the Cheesecake chains. So the first waiter for 1 wheat grain and 1 sourdough bread, and my friend and I finished that. so we asked for some more wheat grain bread, and it took 25 minutes for that to come out. We finally got to eat some bread.. after we finished our meal. It also took a really long time to flag someone down and give us a check.  This place has the decor, good location, and fine food, but the portions are incredibly skimpish and the service is lacking.

The lunch specials are not bad for the price ($13-$16) for a large plate of food, but the regular menu items are pretty expensive for what it is. I finally tried the much so raved about miso salmon and everyone's right - it IS delicious! The salmon wasn't overcooked and the hoisin-like sauce was delicious. I made sure to soak up every last drop with my jasmine rice. But for a $20+ dish I expect more than 5 snap peas please! And of course, I gotta have my brown bread. That sh*t is crack and I can eat loaves at a time!! I asked for some on the way out and the waiter said they were out of the brown bread. I know I was being shady for trying to take some to go, but how dare they lie to me especially since another waiter just brought some out to the table next to us. Guess the shader (me) got shaded, lol. Gripe: There's literally nowhere to park right now and it's $4 valet parking with validation - $25 without (ridiculous). And of course, there is ALWAYS a wait.

We came at 5:30 and our food was brought at 6:45. We waited about an hour for our food, but in the meantime, the waiter brought us some bread, wheat and sourdough. My friends and I ordered the jambalaya pasta, eggplant Parmesan, original cheesecake, and tiramisu cheesecake. Jambalaya pasta- The pasta had a unique flavor to it. It's basically jambalaya mixed with pasta. There were some shrimp and chicken in the dish. The sauce was very yummy. I would order this again. Eggplant Parmesan- The fried eggplant was extremely oily. So oily to the point that I didn't want to finish the dish. The outside wasn't crispy anymore. But the cheese and the marinara sauce was really good. The eggplant also came with some pesto pasta which was even more oily. I don't think I would order this dish again. Onto dessert!!! Original cheesecake- YESSSS! This is what they're famous for. It was creamy and tasted sooo good. Probably one of the best cheesecakes I have ever tasted, so I would definitely order this again. Tiramisu cheesecake- I expected it to taste at least a little like cheesecake, but it didn't at all. The tiramisu flavor overpowered the cheesecake flavor, so basically it was just tiramisu. I would have liked some cheesecake flavors, and this disappointed me, so I don't think I would order this again. Overall my experience at Cheesecake Factory was ok.

I came with a huge group around 5:30 on a Saturday night with a reservation and we still got seated awhile later. The food service was pretty slow around 45 minutes, but it's great for social events. The food is okay, but here are some of the food we ordered. 1. Cajun Jambalaya Pasta - The pasta was pretty good, with a mixture of green (basil?) noodles and orange (tomato?) noodles. I was kind of disappointed that the only meat there was, was chicken and shrimp, which does not make it a jambalaya. Strong Cajun flavor, but literally there was no sauce. Kind of disappointed. 2. Eggplant Parmesan - The eggplant was so oily. After we finished eating 2 (out of 3), the whole plate was drenched. The top is very crispy, not a lot of Parmesan flavor, but the bottom was so oily, it was low-key disgusting. The pesto pasta was really good though.  3. Miso Salmon - DAMN this is actually really good. I love the outer crust flavor, a little bit sweet with Asian flair. Also the rice really matches the dish, because it's so easy to eat. Honestly they do Asian pretty good haha. 4. Evelyn's Favorite Pasta - Okay, I now understand the hype of this dish. It is actually pretty good because how many different kinds of ingredients there were in it. However, I feel like it was extremely salty, with the olives and the artichokes, the salt content was just too high. 5. Original Cheescake - Creamiest cheescake ever. It actually tasted pretty good, super silky and mesmerizing. I kind of forgot how it taste because yes, it's good, but it's not extremely memorable. 6. Tiramisu Cheesecake - This actually tastes like a tiramisu + cheescake combined. I don't know if this is the best combination, because coffee and cheese is kind of questionable together. Nevertheless, it is still really good. Overall, 3 for the food, but +1 for the bread. Okay the sourdough isn't really a sourdough, but the wheat bread was actually super delicious.

She never bothered to even check on us, nor did she even introduce herself. None of us will come to this Cheesecake Factory again. So after an hour, we got 4 out of 6 of our entrees. We asked for cilantro on the side of one dish, and when it came with cilantro we were too that was a lot of modifiers.

127,zahra b.,"San Francisco, CA",287,54,2.0,1.0,2017-08-01,"Woah. I just had one of my worst restaurant experiences ever here. A few friends decided to come out together for their July 31 cheesecake special. We arrived at 8:30pm and were told the wait would be 60-75 minutes long. No problem. We were seated at approximately 9:30pm. We came for the cheesecake special! It was advertised on their website, signage, etc. So place our orders, with some for dine in, which we assume will be on the special and some to go, which we assume will be full price. However, the waitress tells us we need to order entres to get the cheesecake discount. Except that's not anywhere in the marketing or fine print. She insists it is. One of the girls had been there the night before and says she wasn't required to do the same last night. The waitress says it was a mistake. We ask about all of the other people who have been in line and are there as it doesn't appear they are all ordering entres. The waitress says some of the other staff may be unfamiliar with the rules and undercharging people. We ask her to check with her manager.  She does. Her narrative stays the same. Entres are required. The sign at the door says it. I go look at the sign. It matches what corporate has on the site. One per person. Dine in only. Nothing about a required entre. We ask to see the manager.  The manager comes out. He apologizes and says he understands we have been waiting and will give us the 1/2 price cheesecakes. We ask about the confusion and he explains the wait staff were asked to encourage people to order entres to minimize the lines.  What in the world? Encourage and require are two very different things. Not to mention the lying about the posters and other people's orders.  Ok. We're all set. Cheesecakes were ordered nearly 30 minutes ago, pricing issues have been cleared up, and maybe we will enjoy the rest of the night? No.  10 more minutes go by and we still don't have our cheesecakes. One of the girls asks the waitress. Oops. Between the waitress and the manager and clarifying the misrepresentation about the promotion's requirements, they forgot to actually place the order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=80,2.28,2.76,2.452,2.148,2.568

We finally ordered, and our food took 45 minutes to come out. We were anticipating our food, and kept looking around for our waitress, only to see that people sitting around us that had arrived later on got their food before we did. Our waitress passed by and I asked if she could check on our food. Right after she left she came back with our food.  Everything was good, but it definitely was not worth the wait. We asked for boxes once we were full, and that also took about 20 minutes for our waitress to bring out. We wanted to leave and go to the mall after, so we asked another waiter to give us boxes.

I totally understand that this is a very popular place and it does get busy. It took more time to receive our food than it took to get a table. Our waitress was just horrible. I will not name her because that is very embarrassing. She was more attentive with the table besides us and doing who knows what. When she would check on us she walked away so quick we'd still be taking to her and would have the audacity to leave in mid sentence while we were talking.  The food oh my. HORRIBLE. My fiancé had the fettuccini Alfredo pasta. We drove nearly two hours for it because that is the only pasta he likes and for it be uncooked and hard was just disappointing. By the time we even saw our waitress it was just too late to say anything about the food. I had the pasta de Vinci and that was uncooked too. This restaurant is a very well known place. Multibillion corporation, you'd think they'd give they're chefs some cooking lessons. Uncooked pasta can make one very sick. Food and service was horrible. Took us nearly an hour just to get the check and another hour just so she can pick up the check. It died down around 8:30 and we were still receiving bad service. Hope you guys retrain the servers. Oh and hopefully you do something about your floors too.

All this for some cake.  Granted it's a bday cake but, still. Tried to order the bone in ribeye (but received the rib eye) as well as the filet mignon. Both were pretty tasty and seasoned well. They both kept up to the medium rare request. Sides were a standard mashed potatoes and green beans. A little lack luster with little to no seasoning but, they're just fillers anyway.

After a random adventure around the mall, the husband and I rewarded ourselves with a ""small"" lunch at The Cheesecake Factory (I say ""small"" because anyone who's ever been here knows none of their portions are small) We had the pleasure of having Greg as our server who had a great energy, good suggestions for our meal, and made great conversation. We've had a recent history of some not so great restaurant servers so it was very refreshing!  Unfortunately, they were out of the ""Pizza-Style"" Chicken parmesan, but we were very pleased with our second choice of Pineapple crusted chicken and shrimp dish. We split this and ended the meal with Adam's Peanut Butter pie. Holy richness! I love oreo cookie crust but was so happy we split this - I needed to be carried out afterward.

We came at 5:30 and our food was brought at 6:45. We waited about an hour for our food, but in the meantime, the waiter brought us some bread, wheat and sourdough. My friends and I ordered the jambalaya pasta, eggplant Parmesan, original cheesecake, and tiramisu cheesecake. Jambalaya pasta- The pasta had a unique flavor to it. It's basically jambalaya mixed with pasta. There were some shrimp and chicken in the dish. The sauce was very yummy. I would order this again. Eggplant Parmesan- The fried eggplant was extremely oily. So oily to the point that I didn't want to finish the dish. The outside wasn't crispy anymore. But the cheese and the marinara sauce was really good. The eggplant also came with some pesto pasta which was even more oily. I don't think I would order this dish again. Onto dessert!!! Original cheesecake- YESSSS! This is what they're famous for. It was creamy and tasted sooo good. Probably one of the best cheesecakes I have ever tasted, so I would definitely order this again. Tiramisu cheesecake- I expected it to taste at least a little like cheesecake, but it didn't at all. The tiramisu flavor overpowered the cheesecake flavor, so basically it was just tiramisu. I would have liked some cheesecake flavors, and this disappointed me, so I don't think I would order this again. Overall my experience at Cheesecake Factory was ok. The service was really slow and some dishes I didn't really like.

Once seated the waiters are always kind and friendly. I've yet to have a rude waiter here. In my opinion the food is delicious and very well presented. Pricing is a bit up there but portion wise you do get what you pay for. Their cocktails are packed with flavor and not overly strong. For me this is a good thing. Cheesecake! Hello! You can't leave the Cheesecake Factory without a piece of cake. Even if you're full I highly recommend taking a slice home. A plus is coming here for your birthday. My girlfriend loves it when they come with her cheesecake decorated with HBD and a candle. A simple gesture goes a long way.

Otherwise be like my girl and ask if the entire restaurant can sing you happy birthday. lol...  Lastly; I docked a star because parking is always complicated even with the valet service.

Our server Adeline wasn't the most enthusiastic, but was friendly. We'd later find out that she was slightly forgetful. Not trying to be hard on her but I'm going to be honest and give 3 stars instead of 4 stars for this visit. I would recommend that empty plates be removed when your server comes to the table. That wasn't done initially. Later in the meal it was.  For starters, our group had the eggroll sampler. Loved two out of the four (firecracker and salmon). Moving on to the chicken sliders deluxe. There were four large sliders with a side of fries. This alone would probably be good if you were here for drinks and appetizers. We weren't about to stop there, not this time. Onto the entrees. Birthday guest had Fettuccini Alfredo with chicken and mushrooms. As you know, the portions are huge so half was packed up the next day. Second meal was the Bacon-Bacon Cheeseburger which was enjoyed thoroughly by a burger-holic. Nice combo of bacon topped with pork belly. They barely finished it. Third meal was the surf & turf w/ Steak Diane Salmon combo w/ asparagus. Asked for med-rare on both fish and steak, but it was slightly overcooked in my opinion. The Steak Diane was okay. Salmon was good.  Both red wines I had were tasty. However, the Lyric Pinot Noir was better than the red blend. Finally, dessert was on the radar. During our dinner we heard about six birthday songs so we were in good company. Our server had a buddy come over to help her sing and our group joined in of course. The birthday guest was presented with a slice of fresh strawberry cheesecake decorated nicely with the typical hot-fudge birthday wish written on the plate, colorful sprinkles, mounds of whipped cream and a birthday candle.

2774,Lynn L.,"San Jose, CA",0,10,1.0,2.0,2017-09-19,"Our time there started out good despite it being cold inside the restaurant (which is why I have two stars) . The server was attentive and nice. Then our server went on break and we were given another server who was horrible. He did not check on us once! He literally went around our table and did not even bother to check on us. Finally I called over the Manager to get some water. Then we waited 20 minutes to order cheesecake and the server never came. Once again I called the manager over and asked for our check. I was pissed I wanted cheesecake but I was not about to wait any longer there. The server ran our payments and there was a balance of 11.33 due. I put down cash and we left. Suddenly the server chased us out stopped my friends car and told her we owed the $11.33. My friend told the server to check because we put cash down. The server told her not to drive away as he ran in to check, sure enough the money was there. I am beyond upset with the professionalism and aloofness of the server and establishment. Seriously he chased us out instead of checking the folder where the signed receipts and cash was, it was uncalled for and question our integrity, despite being extremely embarrassing.

75,Cindy M.,"San Jose, CA",197,338,856.0,3.0,2017-09-19,"Another birthday meal at TCF, this time dinner. Monday night and the wait was only 10 minutes. Our server Adeline wasn't the most enthusiastic, but was friendly. We'd later find out that she was slightly forgetful. Not trying to be hard on her but I'm going to be honest and give 3 stars instead of 4 stars for this visit. I would recommend that empty plates be removed when your server comes to the table. That wasn't done initially. Later in the meal it was.  For starters, our group had the eggroll sampler. Loved two out of the four (firecracker and salmon). Moving on to the chicken sliders deluxe. There were four large sliders with a side of fries. This alone would probably be good if you were here for drinks and appetizers. We weren't about to stop there, not this time. Onto the entrees. Birthday guest had Fettuccini Alfredo with chicken and mushrooms. As you know, the portions are huge so half was packed up the next day. Second meal was the Bacon-Bacon Cheeseburger which was enjoyed thoroughly by a burger-holic. Nice combo of bacon topped with pork belly. They barely finished it. Third meal was the surf & turf w/ Steak Diane Salmon combo w/ asparagus. Asked for med-rare on both fish and steak, but it was slightly overcooked in my opinion. The Steak Diane was okay. Salmon was good.  Both red wines I had were tasty. However, the Lyric Pinot Noir was better than the red blend. Finally, dessert was on the radar. During our dinner we heard about six birthday songs so we were in good company. Our server had a buddy come over to help her sing and our group joined in of course. The birthday guest was presented with a slice of fresh strawberry cheesecake decorated nicely with the typical hot-fudge birthday wish written on the plate, colorful sprinkles, mounds of whipped cream and a birthday candle. It was oh so good. Light and creamy. Kids hot fudge sundae was good as well.  TCF is still the most diverse menu for your dining experience. Does it always knock your taste buds out of the park...?

269,Tessa H.,"San Jose, CA",133,19,,1.0,2017-10-04,"Not sure what was the purpose of Cheesecake Factory asking me to reach out to them for, when they never followed up on the steps they claimed they would take to try to investigate this incident.  After I got their Yelp response:  1st thing I did:  I went to their site link, inputted a message that they wanted to talk to me, provided my # for them to call.  Later, I got a call from a guy from corporate who was very nice and seemed genuine in passing the message onto the real guy who is in the ""Investigation Dept"" (who was out of the office on time off).  A few weeks went by, nothing.  2nd thing I did:  I called back to corporate and asked to talked to this ""guy"" in the Investigation dept. He didn't seemed to know of my story (perhaps it was never communicated to him) and came off flustered. After telling my story again, he said he would look into it but that without any tangible evidence or police report, this was going to be a tough one.  Hmm...well of course the police never got involved but given how things played out, why not go interview your employees or review the tapes from the cameras at this location?

I went with a party of 6, and we had to wait over an hour until we got seated. While it was really busy, it had died down quite a bit once we got to our table. Service was super slow and it took another hour after ordering before we saw any food. What really bothered us was they brought out our food at different intervals. Two people got their plates first, then another two plates arrived 15 minutes later, then the last two plates arrived about 10 minutes later. It really sucked, especially since we didn't start eating until everyone got their food. By then, some of our plates lost their heat. I ordered the almond crusted salmon salad and couldn't believe what they served me. The (small) piece of salmon looked and tasted old, and was definitely not crusted with almonds. Instead, they squirted a mayo sauce on top and sprinkled almond bits on top (which I couldn't eat, and scraped it off). The bottom of the salmon and edges were super dry too and did not look fit for eating. I don't understand why people like this place so much. It's overpriced, slow and poor quality.

We recently moved to San Jose CA and  went to the restaurant at Westfield Mall on Steven's Creek Rd.  It was so disappointing. We waited over 45 mins for our food so we had to take it to go. My husband ordered a chicken Parmesan sandwich which had no tomato sauce on it and the waiter said the fries weren't ready.  We thought we would give the restaurant another try using their curbside service.  Again we ordered the chicken Parmesan sandwich and another entree. When we arrived at the curbside parking I called their number which rang for 5 mins and I was then transferred to the bakery and held for 4 mins and was hung up on. My husband then went inside and waited in line for our order.  And yet again- no sauce on the sandwich. He then talked to the manager who simply said - sorry.  The service here is horrible and I would really discourage anyone from going to this particular location.  They truly create a horrible experience for this otherwise very reputable restaurant brand.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=360,2.08,2.57,2.604,2.18,2.374

Finally we ordered.  I had chicken madeira.  My three dining partners had jambalaya pasta, salmon and hibachi steak.  The drinks and appetizers came quickly.  The dynamite shrimp were tiny fried shrimp with some slightly spicy dipping sauce.  Meh.  The Cuban rolls were an egg roll cut in half, stuffed with shredded pork, ham, melted cheese and some pickle-mustard sauce.  Cuban sandwich fillings in an eggroll?  Some fusion is bomb, this was a bit of a dud.  Not bad but not fantastic. Our main courses took a long long time.  I'm sure it's hard for the kitchen to support such a large menu.  So many things to cook.  My chicken madeira was burnt on the bottom, not charred, burnt.  It took me a few bites to get past that, but he sauce was decent.  My dining partners all reported that their entrees were ""ok.""

I came with a huge group around 5:30 on a Saturday night with a reservation and we still got seated awhile later. The food service was pretty slow around 45 minutes, but it's great for social events. The food is okay, but here are some of the food we ordered. 1. Cajun Jambalaya Pasta - The pasta was pretty good, with a mixture of green (basil?) noodles and orange (tomato?) noodles. I was kind of disappointed that the only meat there was, was chicken and shrimp, which does not make it a jambalaya. Strong Cajun flavor, but literally there was no sauce. Kind of disappointed. 2. Eggplant Parmesan - The eggplant was so oily. After we finished eating 2 (out of 3), the whole plate was drenched. The top is very crispy, not a lot of Parmesan flavor, but the bottom was so oily, it was low-key disgusting. The pesto pasta was really good though.  3. Miso Salmon - DAMN this is actually really good. I love the outer crust flavor, a little bit sweet with Asian flair. Also the rice really matches the dish, because it's so easy to eat. Honestly they do Asian pretty good haha. 4. Evelyn's Favorite Pasta - Okay, I now understand the hype of this dish. It is actually pretty good because how many different kinds of ingredients there were in it. However, I feel like it was extremely salty, with the olives and the artichokes, the salt content was just too high. 5. Original Cheescake - Creamiest cheescake ever. It actually tasted pretty good, super silky and mesmerizing. I kind of forgot how it taste because yes, it's good, but it's not extremely memorable. 6. Tiramisu Cheesecake - This actually tastes like a tiramisu + cheescake combined. I don't know if this is the best combination, because coffee and cheese is kind of questionable together. Nevertheless, it is still really good. Overall, 3 for the food, but +1 for the bread. Okay the sourdough isn't really a sourdough, but the wheat bread was actually super delicious. I can totally eat that for the rest of my life.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=100,2.2,2.7,2.648,2.544,2.5

How does that even happen? After we waited for over an hour. My 12 year old was not happy. I had to get out of bed and go to McDonald's. The whole point of ordering door dash was so that I did not have to do that because I was sick in bed. The burger was cold. Not warm, no room temperature but cold. After I go get my son food. I come home. Warm up the flat bread and burger. Eat those two items and within two hours I was in the bathroom throwing up. ALL NIGHT!

2956,Dang L.,"San Jose, United States",8,132,183.0,2.0,2017-12-03,"We came here on a Friday night. Paid for the valet parking lot because there wasn't anywhere to park. When we got in at 730pm, there was a 40-50 minute wait. I had predicted this would happen, but the hubby had insisted. These two issues wouldn't have bothered me so much as the rest of my experience all cumulated.  We got seated and it took 15 minutes for our waiter to come by. We ordered. He was supposed to come back with drinks. Got the bread. 10 minutes, water and appetizer. Still waiting for the drinks. Waiter said he was going to bring it over. 5minutes later he brought one drink and said he was going to come back with the other drinks. Waited another 15 minutes. Got the food. Still. I drink. Half way through the meal he checked on us. We asked for the drink and they finally bought it. I realize it's busy but still. Now after venting: Mac and cheese ball - 4 stars. Probably the best dish of the night. Although is quite salty, the creamy tomato dish takes it to another level.  Sirloin with mash potatoes and veggies- 2.5. The hubby ordered well done. It came between medium and rare. But too hungry so he ate it anyways but left about 1/3. Because it was too rare for him. Mash potato- standard although on the saltier side.  Clam chowder - 3 stars. Good but nothing outstanding to rave about.  Steak tacos- comes with 3 tacos, beans & rice. Topped with chopped onions, salsa, guacamole and cilantro. Pretty decent but I didn't like the fact that it tasted sweet with a lingering after taste. Will not order again. - should be mostly savory for a taco.  Greek salad- 1 star. Mostly leafy greens with 2 olives and a couple if tomato and cucumber slices. It literally had no taste except the saltiness  of the feta. Had to ask for a dressing - balsamic. Then it was better. I was told they did toss it in a dressing.  Over all the low stars for the service and disappointed food prep. Maybe going on busy hour may not be a good idea. But I've been to 5 different cheese cakes factory throughout California and have eaten here before too.

Depending on when you come in will determine how long of a wait you'll have for a table. Normally weekends are the busiest. Obviously! Expect to wait anywhere from 30-40 min to be seated. Once seated the waiters are always kind and friendly. I've yet to have a rude waiter here. In my opinion the food is delicious and very well presented. Pricing is a bit up there but portion wise you do get what you pay for. Their cocktails are packed with flavor and not overly strong. For me this is a good thing. Cheesecake! Hello! You can't leave the Cheesecake Factory without a piece of cake. Even if you're full I highly recommend taking a slice home. A plus is coming here for your birthday. My girlfriend loves it when they come with her cheesecake decorated with HBD and a candle. A simple gesture goes a long way.

I went with a party of 6, and we had to wait over an hour until we got seated. While it was really busy, it had died down quite a bit once we got to our table. Service was super slow and it took another hour after ordering before we saw any food. What really bothered us was they brought out our food at different intervals. Two people got their plates first, then another two plates arrived 15 minutes later, then the last two plates arrived about 10 minutes later. It really sucked, especially since we didn't start eating until everyone got their food. By then, some of our plates lost their heat. I ordered the almond crusted salmon salad and couldn't believe what they served me. The (small) piece of salmon looked and tasted old, and was definitely not crusted with almonds. Instead, they squirted a mayo sauce on top and sprinkled almond bits on top (which I couldn't eat, and scraped it off). The bottom of the salmon and edges were super dry too and did not look fit for eating. I don't understand why people like this place so much. It's overpriced, slow and poor quality. I can't say anything about their cheesecake though since I opted not to try and because I couldn't stomach any more of their food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=80,2.0,2.45,2.548,2.02,2.2700000000000005

If zero stars was an option, that would have been a no-brainer. 1. Very short staffed. Everything took a very, very long time. 2. Two out of four of our bread plates were visibly dirty. 3. They were out of fish for their Fish 'n' Chips (my husband doesn't eat meat, so that matters to us). 4. My pasta dish was terrible. 5. The customer service was horrible. My husband and I arrived at 9pm on a Tuesday night, the day after Christmas, with our two year old and four year old, for a nice anniversary dinner. Our main mission was cheesecake, but we decided to have some dinner first. It was crowded but the wait was only about twenty minutes, so that was reasonable to us. We were seated at our table and after five minutes or so, our waitress came by and took our drink orders. When she came a while later, we mentioned that our plates were dirty and asked if she could bring new ones when she brought the bread. I heard her mention to our neighboring table that they were out of bread and that they were making more, so I knew it would be a while (and it was). But when she came to bring the bread a while later, no new plates. Waited a while for new plates. We knew what we wanted but waited quite some time, again, for the waitress to come take our orders. Then we went to place said order only to find out they were out of fish. We picked a replacement item fairly quickly but it still took a very long time to get the food. When the food arrived, my husband's eggplant parmesan was great, but my dish (Shrimp with Angel Hair with the basil garlic lemon cream sauce from the Bistro Shrimp Pasta dish) was terrible. It was watery, flavor-less, and seemed to be missing any trace of salt (I never thought I'd say this of a big chain restaurant, where salt is never in short supply). It looked somewhat creamy, but very, very watery. I tried salting it a couple times and mentioned it to the waitress so she brought some parmesan. That didn't make a big difference so she offered to bring some alfredo sauce. That kind of helped, but by that point it had been a long time and I had just sort of given up hope. My kids were eating the plain pasta (as most kids would), and I ate what I could so as not to be wasteful. Even without kids (who were being so well behaved and patient), I would not have wanted to extend my stay at that restaurant any longer by ordering something else or having it re-made. Not that that was even offered.  After experiencing the super slow service, dirty plates, and dissatisfying food, we thought it prudent to try to resolve it with a manager. We explained the issues to him, were very friendly, understanding and empathetic, and he seemed personable and apologetic. After listening and explaining that they were very short staffed, apologizing for the pasta dish not turning out very well, he offered a cheesecake as a resolution. In my head, I was thinking a whole cheesecake is pretty expensive and probably more than we need, but maybe they have small ones. And even then, if my pasta dish was $20 and a cheesecake is maybe $50, cost of food + bad experience = not that excessive in terms of compensation. So our waitress asks what kind of cheesecake we'd like, we tell her we'd like the Caramel Pecan Turtle cheesecake, but to go (2 year old was starting to fall asleep at the table, can't blame him). When she comes with our to-go bag, there's one small slice of cheesecake in it. My husband and I look at each other like, um, is this happening right now? Is this worth fighting over? We ask the waitress for clarification, she explains yes, the one slice is intentional. She goes on to explain that when things go wrong, that's their go-to solution, one slice of cheesecake, and implies that the real problem is that I still ate my plate of pasta. I caught the manager again on our way out and he mansplained about their customer service, laughed at the idea of a whole cheesecake, and again faulted me for eating the dish. He went on about how they rush a replacement to you for a mess-up dish when I mentioned not wanting to wait any longer. Also threw in that they give you bread/salad while you wait. I mentioned how long we waited for bread, that the waitress had said they were out in the beginning, and he corrected me and said they're never out of bread, you just have to wait 10 minutes for more to be made. If your customer service is working, you shouldn't have to explain how it's working. If your food and service are good, you don't even get to that point. If you resolve any issues that DO arise well, the customer leaves even happier than they would have been if everything was great to begin with. The kicker? We get home and discover they gave us the wrong flavor cheesecake. (Happy anniversary, sweetheart!) We're friendly, patient, and tip 20-100% and had to leave this place without leaving a tip.

89,Cathleen F.,"Sunnyvale, CA",23,16,5.0,1.0,2017-12-27,"For horrendous service, this restaurant takes the (cheese)cake. If zero stars was an option, that would have been a no-brainer. 1. Very short staffed. Everything took a very, very long time. 2. Two out of four of our bread plates were visibly dirty. 3. They were out of fish for their Fish 'n' Chips (my husband doesn't eat meat, so that matters to us). 4. My pasta dish was terrible. 5. The customer service was horrible. My husband and I arrived at 9pm on a Tuesday night, the day after Christmas, with our two year old and four year old, for a nice anniversary dinner. Our main mission was cheesecake, but we decided to have some dinner first. It was crowded but the wait was only about twenty minutes, so that was reasonable to us. We were seated at our table and after five minutes or so, our waitress came by and took our drink orders. When she came a while later, we mentioned that our plates were dirty and asked if she could bring new ones when she brought the bread. I heard her mention to our neighboring table that they were out of bread and that they were making more, so I knew it would be a while (and it was). But when she came to bring the bread a while later, no new plates. Waited a while for new plates. We knew what we wanted but waited quite some time, again, for the waitress to come take our orders. Then we went to place said order only to find out they were out of fish. We picked a replacement item fairly quickly but it still took a very long time to get the food. When the food arrived, my husband's eggplant parmesan was great, but my dish (Shrimp with Angel Hair with the basil garlic lemon cream sauce from the Bistro Shrimp Pasta dish) was terrible.

Very patient with us, asked if we had any questions with the menu, and checked in time to time to see if we needed anything after getting our food.  Thank you for going above and beyond by making my parents a little Happy Anniversary dessert plate after you guys said you usually don't, only for birthdays. I really appreciate it so much that you made it happen. It made our whole dining experience tonight an amazing one, ending it on a high note. I always get the combo items every time I come here because you get two items for around $23 and it's really not a bad deal at all. It's a great selection of combos and it gets you pretty full.  But I thought I'd try something new tonight...and when I asked about the Miso Salmon, Jaimie pretty much sold it to me and I'm really glad that I ordered that tonight. I'm happy to have found my second favorite dish to get there besides the combos, the first one being the Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo. I think it's wonderful that you have an option of brown rice as well which is what I got with my Miso Salmon dish. The brown rice wasn't dry and was not too moist either, it was perfect. The salmon itself was great! Perfectly cooked, complemented well with the sauce on the sides all around the plate. I paired the rice and the sauce because it tasted so good. Haha. Plating was very appealing! (I recommend this dish if anyone wants to try something new within the Salmon area) For you with venturous taste buds, my little brother got the Macaroni and Cheese Burger. It's actually pretty good! He says it's cheesy and the patty was cooked perfectly (medium well). It sure will get you full and it comes with a side choice of fries and I believe the other choice was salad? I might be wrong. But this was another really great dish!  My cousin ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. Portion was good! He said it was pretty spicy! It had green pasta, the shrimp was peeled and it didn't have a tail, so it was easy to eat! It also came with chicken and the chicken was tender itself. Another dish he recommends to get if you're looking for anything in the pasta area! The environment is just like any other Cheesecake Factory, a little dark and intimate. Taking pictures is a little hard, but nothing a flash can fix. The wait also varies on what day you go and time. But it is worth the wait! Next time I'll make room for cheesecake! Haha. Thank you again Jaimie for your amazing service! Be sure to ask for her if you have the chance to!

I'm writing this review because of the horrible horrible service that my family and I received today. Our server was SLOANE.. she needs a bit more training on how to serve her customers. I don't want to put her on blast like that but it's seriously needs to be done. Because the service we received was so bad that I am absolutely upset.  First of all, she NEVER checked up on us. Second, she forgot to give us whatever it was that we asked for. For example I asked for a new plate because it was dirty and had crumbs all over it. She NEVER came back with a plate.. and by the time I reminded her, our appetizers were finish. Well, what's the point. Ok so she MIGHT have been busy. But not really because there was empty tables. Well we gave her the benefit of the doubt. Ok well then when we asked for straws for the whole table, she completely forgot... AGAIN! I tell you, I'm not sure what it was but either she didn't like us? I'm not sure what the case was. Third, everyone in our section who sat AFTER us got their food BEFORE US. We ordered a turkey BLT, fish tacos and a miso salmon. I don't think it's that much. And a big party was eating way before us. And she was their server as well. It took about 35-40 minutes from when we ordered (we ordered right when we sat down because we were looking at the menu while waiting to be seated) to get our food. And in those 35-40 minutes she forgot about giving us our plate and straws and never checked up on us. The only thing she did for us right away was giving us our check when we asked for it. It was in less than 1 minute she came back with our check. Figures...  -- btw I'm not trying to say cheesecake servers are horrible because we seen the wonderful service other tables were getting.

We had the complimentary bread (mmm), the Korean Fried Cauliflower (highly recommend), the Crispy Cuban Rolls (comes with 6 delicious halves), the Four Cheese Pasta (very filling), the Chicken & Biscuits (good chicken), the Lemon-Herb Roasted Chicken (wholesome chicken), and the Herb Crusted Filet of Salmon (not dry!). We were planning on ordering some cheesecake afterwards but were too full this time. People seem to have varying opinions about The Cheesecake Factory, but me and my family happen to be quite fond of it! It's great for casual celebrations and/or a nice, slightly classier meal!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2,2.48,2.41,2.448,2.8640000000000003,2.438

2914,rob s.,"Mountain View, United States",1,29,15.0,1.0,2018-07-01,"Was seated at 4:20 and placed our order for appetizer and entries around 4:30.  Appetizer arrived after 5pm.  A new server introduced himself and informed us that the previous server had left for the day and notified us that the entree orders had not been entered in the kitchen by the previous server.  One of the assistant managers stopped by and said the entrees would be at our table in ten minutes. That was at 5pm. She didn't even apologise for the delay.  I asked to speak with the manager and he profusely apologised for the issue and promised to bring our dinner right away.  5:40 pm and we were served our entree and it was piping hot.  But we were no longer hungry.  As a consolation, the manager offered us one free slice of cheesecake. There was four of us at the table.  Very disappointed at the experience.  The new server was very courteous and we made sure he wasn't held accountable with a generous tip.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2,2.88,2.58,2.544,,2.7
2980,S L.,"Vancouver, Canada",1,30,,3.0,2018-09-01,It is your usual American restaurant. The portions are big like their menu. I always have a hard time selecting what to order. The bread is different from other places. One day hope to make it for their happy hour. Getting cheese cake to go is always good as they do a good job in packaging it and is easy to take with you.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=60,2.88,2.56,2.536,,2.688
2913,Jesus E.,"Ann Arbor, United States",155,116,81.0,3.0,2018-09-01,"Call me basic but I love a Cheesecake factory moment. The food is always solid - I usually do the spicy cashew chicken (not spicy in the least but it is delicious). The huge portions ensure you'll have you'll have something to eat for lunch the next day. I do have a soft spot for their cheesecakes. My faves are the red velvet and the banana cream. The Valley Faire location is always insanely busy so definitely expect a bit of a wait, both to be seated and to get your food. Because of how full it always is, it also tends to be pretty loud. Last time I was there my friend and I ordered the grilled cheese sticks and nashville hot chicken nuggets and it was quite a wait before we got them. They ended up coming out after our entrees. Despite the chaos, it was a solid lunch overall.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2,2.88,2.54,2.532,,2.676
2966,Melissa P.,"Arcadia, United States",119,5,,2.0,2018-10-01,"""Curbside"" was a train wreck this past visit.  I arrived the 20 minutes recommended after ordering only to find no one was picking up either the posted curbside number or regular restaurant number.  I waited 10 minutes and even though my baby was sleeping I got out her car seat and went in to pick up my ""curbside"" order.  I continued to wait in line for 10 minutes before ever getting to speak with someone only to find my order was STILL not ready for ""a few minutes""...  whatever that meant.  It was only ONE ITEM.  Many people looked perturbed like they were also unhappy and waiting for a long time.  The employees looked stressed and scrambling around as if they'd been the weeds for awhile.  I waited for 10 more minutes then asked to cancel my order and left empty handed.  What a horrible horrible experience.  The only reason I'm giving this restaurant 2 stars is because when I have time to dine in the food is always great and the servers are always nice.  Lesson learned...  DO NOT ORDER CURBSIDE SERVICE, YOU MAY JUST STARVE.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=40,2.92,2.51,2.536,,2.6739999999999995
2933,Shelby N.,"Santa Clara, United States",148,1,,1.0,2018-12-01,"Me and my son wanted to spend quality time  and enjoy food from the cheesecake factory and we ordered door-dash, but the manager Crystal was super rude and disrespectful not only to us but to the man who was working for door-dash. She blamed everyone else for her mistakes and was very condescending when I asked her questions about my order, because of her lack of communication skills and rude mannerisms I will never order door dash from here again.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=20,2.76,2.51,2.536,,2.6099999999999994
2960,James R.,"San Jose, United States",2,6,1.0,2.0,2018-12-01,"Went to dinner there last night and wanted to give some feedback as constructive criticism.  There were 5 of us and, about 20 minutes after ordering a manager stopped by the table to let us know that they did not have biscuits available for the the chicken and biscuit entree that one of us ordered.   She mentioned that the waiter would be by momentarily to take her new order.   It took about 5 minutes for him to get back and take her new order.  About 10 minutes later our food came out, with the exception of the new order, which they said would be out soon.   None of the hot entrees were as warm as I would expect them to be, so I would surmise that they sat, a while, being held as they worked on the last order.  It took about 15 minutes for the last order to come out.  Food generally was good, but the timing issues - we should have heard quicker on the problem with the order and all of the entrees should have come out together.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=40,2.72,2.52,2.528,,2.6
