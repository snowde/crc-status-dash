88,Alex P.,"Sarasota, FL",6,46,4.0,4.0,2015-07-30,"Had a pretty good experience at this Cheesecake Factory location. If you're going for dinner, try to go early if possible - or make a reservation. I was previously advised that they take reservations Monday through Thursday, but on the weekends they have no reservation system in place. This location is extremely busy - when we arrived for dinner at 4:00 PM on a Sunday, the wait was up to 30 minutes and by the time our table was ready around 4:30, the wait was up to 45 minutes. I've also heard of the wait time easily reaching up to 90 minutes on Friday / Saturday nights.  Anyway, the dinner experience overall was quite nice! The atmosphere can get a little loud due to the restaurant being so crowded, but overall it's a pretty nicely decorated Cheesecake Factory. The menu can be a little overwhelming at times considering there are over 100 different items to choose from, but I've never ordered something I didn't end up liking. My favorite is the Chicken Di Pana - breaded chicken with mashed potatoes and broccoli in a creamy white wine sauce - very delicious! My Dad ordered the spaghetti with meatballs - which he said was very good. After dinner, I ordered the Mango Key Lime Cheesecake which was so delicious as it seemed to have a perfect balance of rich and sweet while being slightly tart. Another thing to be aware of are the portion sizes. Most of the menu items come out in portions large enough for two. Perfect for eating a normal portion there and taking the rest home for a great lunch the next day. They also have a ""Skinny Menu"" which is great for lighter and low calorie options. Overall, this Cheesecake Factory was pretty good - and proven to be comparable with any other location. Service was alright, friendly, but not very attentive - once again, due to so many tables being constantly turned.

I ordered the Cuban sandwich. It was good but not great. About what I expected it would be from a place like this. Better than  It could of been but not the real thing. Honestly probably should of ordered something else but I was really craving a Cuban lately. The fries that came with it were very bland and not very good, the same you would expect from an Applebee's. My girlfriend ordered the Mac and cheese burger and that was probably the best thing we ordered. Although I wasn't much of a fan of the Mac and Cheese part, the burger itself was fantastic. The meat was cooked perfect and it was very tasty. It was one of the few things that surprised me.  The server was also very nice and checked in regularly making sure we were happy. I feel bad for only giving three stars, if I could give another half star I would but I don't feel like this trip deserved four stars. I'll probably come in again sometime and try something else.

Portions are smaller and a lot of changes in the recipes of items on the menu. Meaning it has the same name but is not what it was anymore.  This experience not so good today. My son ordered simple bow tie pasta. When it came it was so salty, he could not eat it. After sending back, we were informed that a replacement would be the same as that is the new recipe. Meaning, Cheesecake Factory is incapable of boiling water and cooking pasta without overloading it with salt??? I tried the California Avocado Salad. I won't get it again. It should be called Cilantro Salad and some other stuff (but mostly cilantro). My wife ordered the Kale Quinoa salad which she has had a few times before. Oddly, there were parts of the Cilantro Salad in hers.  We'll probably stay away from this location in the future.

Probably 10 minutes pass and she comes with the wrong drinks, and doesnt bring any bread but instead of fixing it she  immedietly goes to another table and before even taking their drink order sets the bread down (you know the bread that we asked for and that was on the tray with our drinks) for them without asking if they wanted any.

Our servers name was David and that's about all we got out of him....my one friend who was with me tried to engage him in conversation which  somehow annoyed him because he very openly said in front of us to his manager he didn't want to wait on us...by this time our other friend showed up and she wants to order but now we have no server and time is flying by...we ask to speak to a manager.  The manager comes over and gets us a very nice young lady who was actually ending her night but picked us up as a favor to her boss and apparently DAVID.   When we told the manager what had happened he said ""we aren't going to talk about that""  he basically dismissed this employees rude behavior towards myself and my friends. When we left it was all we talked about, it was absolutely confusing and made us all feel really uncomfortable. The worst part was that my bartender friend didn't even get to eat except for soup.. When we called the next day we spoke with Brian the day manager, who I relayed the whole incident to.  Brian assured us that this is not normal behavior he asked if the manager did anything to compensate, which is a  no.  It was a hundred dollars to have a miserable time. Not to mention that the manager kept trying to put his arm around my friends which was highly offensive and I cannot believe that is acceptable behavior.

One of the hostesses gave us an electronic notifier and told us the wait time was 10 minutes. We stayed in the entrance area and when the waiting seats came open, we sat. After around 20 minutes, the buzzer went off and we walked the 4 steps over to the hostess station where the girl took our buzzer and had us stand to the left of the station with a few other parties that had been waiting. We stood there in that line for another 15 minutes and watched a few other parties get seated that were clearly there after we were. The couple in front of us started complaining because they noticed the same thing happening to them too. After two confused seating hostesses chatted back and forth we were all told that they were no longer seating inside and if we wanted to wait, we would have to sit outside.  We just plain left. (So did two other parties as well!) No managers were around, the hostess staff in this restaurant could care less, are cold, unfriendly and just plain unprofessional! The waiters all look unhappy, stressed and were not friendly or polite either. Most just shoved their way around and through people like we were just some insignificant obstacles in their paths. I have never been to one of these restaurants before, and quite frankly, I won't bother to try again! If this is the kind of example they preset in an upscale mall... forget it. I can spend $5 at Burger King, get two Whopper meals and have them give me the wrong drink, at least that will only take 3 minutes and I'll still be fed. Sheesh! Piss pore service from a bunch of disgruntled employees that could care less about customers is not a way to run a business... well, not one that will succeed here anyway. We went around the corner to the Yo Sushi place in the mall. We probably spent more money, but we had exceptional service, a good time and I will certainly go back there!

The restaurant was fairly busy. Our waitress came around and took our drink order. We ordered a Diet Coke and two glasses of  Sauvignon blanc.  A few minutes later our waitress returned with the soda and the two glasses of wine. Then she took our order. About five minutes later our waitress came back to the table picked up the two, now half full glasses of wine, and said ""I'm sorry I gave you the wrong wine. I have to take these"" then continued to say ""The proper wine would be out soon"".  We replied by telling her that we were enjoying that wine and would like to continue drinking it. We asked her to put the glasses back down. She told us she had already placed the new order and that she needed to take these from us and then left.  Ten minutes later, our replacement wine had not arrived. The waitress came to ask if I wanted a refill on the Diet Coke. We asked about the wine and she said that they printer was not working at the bar and they couldn't fulfill the order at the moment.  We told the waitress that we were unhappy with the experience, that never over the course of our lives has someone literally taken drinks from us while we were drinking them and enjoying them. She said ""do you want a refill on the Diet Coke or not and then walked away"".  Unsatisfied and still without drinks we flagged down a manager. We explained the situation to him in detail. He apologized said that the waitress was new and told us he would have a talk with her.  We informed the manager that the proper way to handle this situation would have been to have the waitress start by saying ""excuse me I have just realized that we severed you a Chardonnay and not a sauvignon blanc then ask us if we would like to exchange them rather then just grabbing our glasses."" Had we been presented with that option we would have said the drinks were fine and continued with our meal.  The other option was to leave us with the Chardonnay (for free since they took our drinks and poured them down the drain anyway) and then just bring us the proper drinks.

Certainly nothing to complain about. Usually we order two entrees and they are always huge. We have enough for lunch the next day and sometimes the day after. So, we thought we'd try something different -- let's split and entree. We ordered a beer and a wine (not the cheapest place for those, BTW) and a side salad.

We notice nasty  dirty grimes on our silverware lettuce was stuck on n the forks and cheese chunk and it's dark in there but we can still see it .for a party of 6 waiting over an hour and a half for a table you can at least clean it better.

Cheesecake Factory has always had long waits, but in the past I feel the service was top-notch. Unfortunately, it's all gone down hill. Food was sloppily prepared and delivered to our table 1 hour after sitting down.

28,Travis H.,"Sarasota, FL",50,114,355.0,3.0,2017-04-22,"Oh Cheesecake Factory. You truly are consistent, but in this case, that's not exactly a good thing. Honolulu's Cheesecake Factory is their busiest location worldwide, and my wife and I were there weekly. We've been to this location several times now, and I really question why we keep going back. I imagine it's convenience with the location, but I really don't know.  The food is severely overpriced. I can go to dozens of other places in Sarasota and have better food at a cheaper price point. Again, the food isn't bad, but it's not worthy of the hefty price tag. The service is so hit and miss that you honestly can have outstanding service one visit and then have absolute garbage service the next. Our most recent dinner here was again disappointing. My order came out incorrect after a very long wait, and then it was blamed on the cooks. Given that the waiter didn't write our order down, I highly doubt they don't know the difference between white and brown rice and mushrooms vs no mushrooms.  With that being said, I'll likely still come here on occasion. I know what I'm getting, and some dishes are actually quite good if you can get past the $20-25 prices per plate. I know Cheesecake Factory is a huge chain, but I wish they'd be a bit more personable and bring something new to the table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sarasota,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72

I took my family to dinner here while I was in town visiting. It had been a while since I was at a CCF, but like always the food is so good. This is the newer location at the  Mall at UTC. There is valet parking if you feel you need it. We sat outside on the patio where there are a lot of fans to help cool you down, and in the center was a very zen fountain. It was quite calming. I noticed while looking over the menu the amount of calories had been added which obviously for dieting and health conscious decisions I understand, but it was a bit overwhelming trying to pick something once I saw the high amount of calories in pretty much everything.  I got my favorite appetizer the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes to share with everyone. It was just as good as I remember, and the girls loved it too. My mom had never had them before. For my meal, I got one of my favorites which is the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, and I switched out the white rice for the wasabi mashed potatoes. This dish and the flavors are so tasty. The peanut sauce and the shreds of coconut just make such a savory combination. My sister got the Shrimp Scampi, and my mom had the Americana Cheeseburger. Everyone enjoyed their food, and my sister and I had leftovers to snack on later. Our waitress was awesome and very attentive.

They have smaller plates, too so families and groups can share.  The cheesecake is obviously amazing. They have a new kind out that I can't wait to try with Funfetti.  The wait can be long and the service can be slow. But it is in a wildly popular mall so dinner gets a little crazy. The atmosphere is very classy. I don't know how all the pieces and images work but they do.  Their bar is a little lack luster. :(  I feel like it is mainly drinks you see everywhere. They don't seem to have really creative cocktails like I have seen other places have. Maybe because it's a huge chain? Not sure.
