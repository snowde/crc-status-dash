Some say it's sometimes difficult to decide what you're going to have because of all the choices. I, however, do not complain about too many choice's on people! Anyway, everything I've ever had at The Cheesecake Factory has been very good, and I have no complaints. I like that you can order 1/2 orders of food. This saves me from having to waste left overs in my fridge; I almost never eat left overs. The reason I didn't give this place more than 3 stars, is because their drinks are not strong enough. Everything tastes watered down, unless, of course, it's a straight shot of alcohol. To sum up...food good, drinks bad.

434,Mo k.,"Hanover Park, IL",0,1,,1.0,2012-01-03,"I have never been soo livid, after the experience I had at The Cheesecake Factory. For starters, it was my sons birthday, which in itself should be a joyous occassion. Being that I knew my party was going to be large, I figured I would call ahead to make a reservation. I spoke with Jesse, and was told that it was on a first come first basis. I thought that this was a bit peculiar, due to the size of my group, but I took her word for it. We arrived at 6:30, and we were told that since we had such a large party, that the wait would be an hour and a half. We waited for two hours, and still no table. After a while, I figured I would check on the status of the table, we were told that it would be ready shortly, as they had just finished up another party, and the aread was being prepped and cleaned. As if things couldn't get any worse, I then received the figurative smack in the face when I saw a group of 11 being seated after being there for less than 5 minutes. When I inquired how they got such V.I.P. treatment, the response was simple; ""because they had a reservation."" I'm not sure if I was speaking English when I called in at 1:30 in the afternoon to make a reservation; but apparently they pick and choose who they want to accomodate. I digressed though, so some minutes later, I went to check on the status yet again, now the hostess who was originally assisting us, had disapperead (how convenient). Another hostess came and got us, then we were escorted to the bar area, where a make-shift table was setup for us. Now, remember me stating that the whole purpose of us going, was for my CHILD'S birthday party. Why would they think it appropriate to place us in the bar with little children? Of course we were upset by having wasted soo much time, to be sat in some corner like peasants. In the midst of trying to figure out how such a mishap could occur, the manager comes out (at last some HELP...wrong!!!). The manager was actually worse than the people working for him, we were faced with an ultimatum: either we take the table or leave. To make matters worse, when I asked for his name, he told me ""You don't NEED to know my name, as a matter of fact leave right now!!"" Long story short we were essentially thrown out of Cheesecake Factory. I would like to thank all the staff that we came in contact with for ruining my son's birthday, maybe I'll be more patient and understanding the next time I come in, and wait for 3 hours or more to get sub-par service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=420,3.32,3.32,3.32,3.0440000000000005,3.3200000000000003

I don't eat cheesecake but here I'll make the exception because these cheesecakes ARE NO ORDINARY CHEESECAKES! Each one looks gourmet and beautiful and tastes just the same! You know how sometimes the looks of a dessert does not match the taste? Here, all are scrumptious!  I had a pulled pork sandwich which was the best I've ever had. The menu is so big anyone can find anything on it to suit them, whether large or small appetite or fat wallet or skinny wallet. Speaking of ""skinny"" , there is a special menu for those who want under 600 calories - check it out!  That will enable you to leave room for cheesecake! I always go around 11 AM. on a Sunday when there is no wait yet. In that way, I can decide whether I'll do breakfast, lunch or dinner at that moment.

213,Roseanne S.,"Villa Park, IL",97,325,75.0,4.0,2012-02-08,"Cheesecake factory: you are a diet's worst nightmare. Not that I'm on any kind of diet, but I'm just saying. HUGE FREAKING PORTIONS. I've come here for dinner a couple times, and each time I've had to take food home. I love when they ask if I've saved room for dessert. No, sorry. I don't have a five gallon stomach to hold in all the food you are putting in front of me. This review sounds bad, but it's not. I just have to note the portions first. Aside from the amount of food you get, the food itself is actually pretty good. My boyfriend and I came here and we wisely split our dinner. We ordered an herb chicken breast with mashed potatoes. The plate was so big and there was a lot of food, but we shared and it was enough for both of us. This is the way to go. You save money, and you can finish what is in front of you without taking home food you're never going to touch. Then we had cheesecake. Excuse the acronym, but OMFG. I had the peanut butter and chocolate cheesecake (possibly called the Reeces cheesecake) and I totally had a foodgasm. It made me so blissfully happy. I've also had breakfast here and it's really good.The potatoes are nicely done and you get huge pieces of toast (of course) but they use dark wheat toast with grains and everything. This place is a wee bit pricey, but that's because of the portions.

348,Jennifer C.,"Hoffman Estates, IL",0,4,2.0,4.0,2012-02-10,"The reason for four stars is the amount of care and understanding the manager showed us. Also, the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes: PHENOMENAL!!! :D They were so delicious I wished I had ordered two! (but of course, I was anticipating the gigantic dinner portions Cheesecake Factory is known for.) My family and I went in for dinner: Dad chose the ""Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta"", Mom chose ""Evelyn's Pasta"", and I...well I wanted some all-american style meatloaf. So I went with the ""Famous Factory Meatloaf"" My only complaint is that they had not described the meatloaf's flavor or use of spices in that dish at all--therefore, I was expecting a completely different taste from it. When I took the first bite of the meatloaf there was a very very very strong taste/smell of some type of herb. I wasn't prepared for this kind of twist in flavoring of the traditional meatloaf. On the menu, all it said was ""FAMOUS FACTORY MEATLOAF: served with mashed potatoes, gravy, and corn succotash"". Absolutely no mention of the strong use of that one herb I don't even want to know the name of. Since I didn't want to spend my dinner eating mashed potatoes and corn, I alerted the waiter (Ryan R.) who immediately offered to switch entrees. He could definitely tell I was not satisfied, and took my alternative order for the Four Cheese Pasta with Chicken. A couple minutes later, the manager (didn't introduce his name) came to our table with a complimentary house salad with strawberry vinaigrette. He apologized for the inconvenience and informed us that he placed my order at the topmost priority and will be served as quickly as possible. The food was decent, not out-of-this-world incredible, but because of the service I received, I will be coming back. Good service is indispensable.

I cannot tell you how much I like this place.  Sometimes it's hit or miss. Tonight was a total HIT. Our server, Laura, was so sweet and attentive. She made sure our drinks were always topped off.  Tried the Bang-Bang Spicy Chicken and Shrimp dish. I was worried that it would be too spicy but honestly, it had no kick to it. That was perfect because I didn't want too much heat but the dish just sounded good.  Hubby had the New Orleans Shrimp and something dish. Again, that too was good.  Tons of leftovers since these portions are the size of a tiny baby. Ordered cheesecake to go because not one more bite food could be consumed tonight.  Looking at our dishes, it hardly looks like we even made a dent in them.  Good food, great cheesecakes, awesome service. Only problem was the heat was on blast. Even after several customers complained management could not control the temperature. Needless to say, we had to high tail it out of there.

264,Phil S.,"Hoffman Estates, IL",133,250,109.0,3.0,2012-02-29,"I come to Cheesecake maybe twice a year when we're sick of everything else and we can't decide or disagree on what to eat.  The menu is literally a book and they cover most fatty food groups with an above average elegant touch consistently.   I've tried most of their pastas, sandwiches, specialties and appetizers over the years and have yet to be disappointed.  You may find this weird but I'm not much for sweets so I have only tried their cheesecake a grand total of once and that was dessert someone else had ordered.  They have plenty of seating at every location I've been to and the wait is short even at the busiest times which makes it an even easier decision to make when trying to figure out what to eat. Service at this location is hit or miss but I will say that the last time we went we had the most courteous and reserved waitress I've ever had. I wish I remembered her name.  She guessed what we wanted perfectly before we even ask over and over and delivered with a smile.  She wasn't all jabbery like some are in an attempt to get a big tip.  When I'm trying to eat I really don't care for all the jibber jabber waitstaff can sometimes spew with such practiced fakeness.  All I require is that you're there when I need you and you make an honest attempt to accommodate my requests.

261,Josh M.,"Downers Grove, IL",90,110,73.0,4.0,2012-03-11,Holy shit there is something wrong with a restaurant that needs to put advertisements in their menu binders. Yah its a binder. There is no lack of choices and fortunately most of them are good. With a happy hour that offers half price apps its hard not to just make a meal out of them. I have tried some of the burgers and pastas but there are a couple of apps or what they call small plates that have me wanting to return. There are the buffalo blasts that are essentially buffalo chicken inside a wonton wrapper and fried. Can't go wrong with that. Another standout are the sweet corn tamale cakes. A little crispy and perfectly creamy in the center. I would order tamales more often if they were like this and not the usual dried up bricks. The most unlikely item that blew me away was the Vietnamese tacos. Soft pork buns with an addictive soy marinade and a ton of pickled veggies to cut through the richness. I would have never expected them at a Cheesecake but im not complaining. Id skip the onion rings and the spinach artichoke dip they are kinda crappy. Get your fix at TGI's if you must. Cheesecake can be pretty expensive so take advantage of the happy hour you will thank me for it and get some extra tacos for lunch the next day they reheat perfectly somehow.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=260,3.64,3.44,3.44,3.152,3.5200000000000005

I always enjoy going to The Cheesecake Factory whenever I'm at Woodfield; it's just a good time. I was recently there for a lunch date with my BFF. There was a long wait, of course, but since there were only two of us, it was only about a half hour. We ordered a couple drinks, hence the getting ""drunk at The Cheesecake Factory"" part. I ordered J.W.'s Pink Lemonade, which came with Skyy citrus vodka, raspberry liqueur and lemonade. It was delicious! It was sweet and sour and refreshing. Highly recommend.  For an entree, I ordered the Grilled Chicken and Avocado Club, which had chicken breast, avocado, bacon, tomato, melted Swiss and herb mayonnaise. Really tasty! I would definitely order it again. It also came with plenty of fries served in this cute, metal container. Then of course, we had to order cheesecake. I got the Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake, which of course was amazing. Once you get seated, the service is always really good. Our waitress was friendly and attentive, despite the restaurant being super-busy. We didn't feel rushed and hung out there sipping cocktails for quite a few hours.

After being seated, the first thing that came out of my boyfriend's Aunt's mouth was, ""Ooooh, there is something on my spoon.  I guess I won't be using that.""  My boyfriend and I started inspecting our spoons and he found something green stuck on it, like a dried up green pasta that wasn't washed off.  It made me wonder what their kitchen looked like.  Was it clean?  Is the food cooked in sanitary pots and pans?  What else was dirty?  I would have overlooked that thought if it was just one, but two spoons was one too many.  Luckily, after pointing this out to our server, he immediately took it off our hands and replaced them.  He apologized sincerely. Everyone ordered something different.  I just remember what my boyfriend and I ordered.  He ordered the Chicken Fettuccine and I ordered the Jambalaya Pasta.  He said it had too much salt on it.  We suggested he let the server know but one thing about my boyfriend, he doesn't like to complain.  As for mine, it was very tasty and full of flavor.  The chicken was tender and juicy, the pasta had a good spice to it where I could still taste other seasonings than just a burning tongue, and the pasta was cooked perfectly.  If I had to nitpick at something, it would have to be how the shrimp didn't taste fresh; it was almost tough and chewy.  Also, the dirty spoons were still swirling in my thoughts and wondered if my plate was clean before they placed the food on it.   At the end of the meal, the waiter took our plates and packed it for us except for my boyfriend's mom's salad.  He forgot she wanted it packed and tossed it away.  To save his mistake, he had the kitchen staff make another for her and packed that in a container and apologized.  What makes a great restaurant isn't just the food but that and the service of the staff.  The server gave us his input on what he liked on the menu and his opinions on the food.  When a server can give you a feedback on the food and explain what is in a dish, it means he/she has tasted it and knows his/her restaurant.  I believe it's important because not everyone knows what they want to order.

The food is never more than, meh. 5. Their menu is more overwhelming than an accounting textbook.  With that being said, it is what it is. I will admit, their addition of the small plates and SkinnyLicious menu items makes dining there a bit less gluttonous. The food is decent, especially the salads and the small plates. I stick to those. But, the shining star of Cheesecake Factory is, in fact, their cheesecake. I, for one, love their Vanilla Bean, Key Lime, or Pumpkin cheesecakes. They're extremely flavorful and always creamy and decadent. The portions are huge, and being diabetic, I usually have enough cheesecake for a week. And I do love the fact they have a low carb cheesecake. It makes me and my pancreas quite happy.

I used to visit more, but I'm always annoyed at some point during my visit for one of many reasons that I usually have to wait a few months before my next visit. Why the four stars then?  Well, the food is delicious!  Overpriced?  Yes, but delicious!  And if the visit causes enough aggravation, a manager will get involved and usually find a way to try and apologize...usually thru more of the yummy food!   Most recently, my sister and a girlfriend of ours stopped in for a Monday (?) night dinner. No wait. This was a first!  That was a nice start. We were seated by the large birthday party in the back, so it was loud. Well, it's always loud here. In case you haven't caught on yet...you go for the food and not the conversation time with your loved ones.  Butter. It's a precious commodity at The Cheesecake Factory. Seriously, I think it is part of the official TCF training. You do not, under any circumstances, give more than three little foil wrapped butters to any one table at any given time!  They'll give you warm bread 'til the cows come home however.  I have yet to try something here that I didn't like. From the Kobe burger to the shrimp club sandwich to the Cajun chicken littles to the thai chicken pasta. It's all good. Really good. The cheesecake ain't too shabby either. Expensive though. $7 ish for a slice. It's so rich that you can easily share it. Oh, and every slice arrives with fresh whipped cream. If that's not your thing, just ask them to skip the whipped cream.  My suggestion?  Go in with the knowledge of my review behind you and you won't be disappointed. Go ahead...text each other at the table to 'talk', eat your bread...and keep asking for butter, pack up half your meal right away because it's a huge serving and eat dessert. Because you can.

And it'd probably be the only reason for me to actually choose Cheesecake Factory over another eating establishment. This last visit, I was there with a friend and we ordered from their Sunday brunch menu (we were there at 11am). I got the Bruleed French Toast which was just ..... weird. I didn't care for it at all and left most of it on my plate. Thank goodness I ordered bacon ($3 additional) with it, or I would have been starving. It was just not for my palate. The inside of the french toast was still ""wet"" and ""gooey"", where it made me think it wasn't cooked all the way thru. I don't think that was the case -- it's just how they make it. I'll stick with regular good old fashioned french toast --- if it ain't broke, don't fix it!!!! Sometimes I think places go too far with trying to put their own spin or ""froo-frooing"" something up when they really don't have to. It also took a long time for our meals to come up. For french toast (and my friend had eggs, pancakes, bacon, hashbrowns and toast) and other breakfast items, we did sit there, but since I was also visiting with my friend, it wasn't a HUGE deal. However, they DID recognize this, and apologized. We had a manager stop by the table to also apologize and offered us comp dessert. YES, please!!!! (Like I said, the cheesecake is probably the only reason to really go as I've yet to find a dish that I just MUST go there for) It was nice that they recognized their fault, and even though we didn't complain, they stepped up and nipped it right away.

333,Katy B.,"Milwaukee, WI",42,126,,1.0,2013-04-15,"This place is a joke, and a bad one. Who waits 2+ hours for mall food? Not this gal. Experience numero uno: last summer, stopped by to have lunch and was informed of a 2 hour wait for a table for two. No thanks. Some food is worth a 2 hour wait, and I am absolutely positive that that food does not come from The Cheesecake Factory. Second experience, this weekend: a group of 18, including folks visiting from out of town. The organizer called months in advance to make reservations and was informed reservations are not accepted. She was informed that our group of 18 should show up at 4 for a 6pm seating. While that would turn most away, we showed up dutifully at 4, and were told that they would not take our name so early, and that we should come back at 5. At 5, our group was told that there would be a 2-3 hour wait. Huh, what?  Upon calling the manager, a member of our group was told that it was ""not possible"" that we had been turned away at 4. Sarah (said manager) must have the ultimate faith in her employees, and perhaps she meant that it was not probable. This statement would still have been inappropriately condescending towards a potential customer, but may have still retained the possibility of being correct. Either way, it was not correct. We were there at 4, and we were turned away. So basically, to top off the in-restaurant seating debacle, the manager was not only of no help, she was unnecessarily rude. Customer service appears to be bottom of this chain's priority list. Guess what? Our group had an awesome night at Westwood Tavern. It is nearby, the food was delicious, and the drinks were great, too. Their servers and manager bent over backward to accommodate our group, and we had a fantastic night and great service.

The Cheesecake Factory is a great chain restaurant...I mean, they are obviously doing something right to have it always be on an hour wait (or more!).  It's just TOO MUCH.  The place is crazy all the time.  The food portions are gargantuan.  I can keep going but honestly?  Just know this is a place you should only venture out to and brave the crowds for if someone else requires it.  Otherwise, you have about a million different options to go to for similar items.  Yes, CF has their own things that no one else has...but they also have some things that everyone else has.  And the bonus of going to the other places is that you don't have so many options...I have a hard enough time choosing between six different burgers on a menu, but when you throw every ethnic cuisine at me on one menu?  I can't do it.  After (too) much deliberation, I ended up getting a really delicious wasabi crusted ahi tuna dish, but I also wanted a Mexican dish, a Thai dish, a Chinese dish, an American dish...like I said, it's just too much.

I didn't quite grasp the meaning behind the Egyptian decor (why isn't it a factory that makes cheesecake?), but it was at least pretty. Our waitress was friendly and prompt. Our food came out quickly. I had the Monterey Cheeseburger ($11.95) with sweet potato fries (+$1). Giant burger with avocado, jack cheese, arugula, red onion, and honey mustard mayo. Very good, and cooked to my liking. The sweet potato fries required an extra wait and were unremarkable. Others got the Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad ($14.50), which was absolutely massive. It looked like there was literally a whole head of lettuce in that bowl. The original margarita I had was meh. No life in it, pretty watery. I tried the Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake and found it, like all their cheesecakes seem to be, decadent but much, much too rich.

326,Jo R.,"Westmont, IL",21,144,181.0,4.0,2013-05-14,"On numerous occasions, I have wanted to dine at this restaurant. I rarely do. Why? The Cheesecake Factory, regardless of location, is always packed. And I am trying to avoid spending my waning youth groveling for a table. Truly, I have sprouted gray hair waiting to be seated at various Cheesecake Factory restaurants.  Well, this day was different and we decided to wait. My mother wanted to visit the Cheesecake Factory for her day, Mother's Day. We tried to make reservations but the restaurant does not accept them. So, we prepared to wait at least two hours to gain entrance. Upon arriving, we were told it would be a 90 minute wait. It turned out to be slightly less, about 70 minutes.  We were seated around 5:00 p.m. and ordered drinks immediately. I ordered the red raspberry martini which was good. It was not the best martini I have ever had, but I could tell it contained alcohol. The raspberry taste was strong and it came with lots of foam on top, which I like. Two types of warm bread were also served as we had our cocktails.  For my entree, I chose the chicken salad sandwich with the green salad. It came almost laser fast; I was truly amazed. The sandwich weighed about 50 pounds and may have contained a whole chicken family. It was a mayonnaise-based chicken salad with chicken chunks, roasted almonds, lettuce, and tomato. I liked it, but I think I would have preferred a less chunky texture. The best part of the sandwich was the grilled brioche bread. That made it special. The green salad was a nice option. I chose it instead of the French fries. There are many other items on the menu to choose from; it is quite overwhelming.  If you hope to try the cheesecake, I recommend ordering it first or to-go. I cannot imagine having room in my stomach for it after the meal.

Especially now that they have a lighter options menu, this is back to being one of my favorite restaurants. And don't let the ""smaller portions, lower calories"" fool you - these are the same generous CF portions you've come to know and love (and sometimes fear). You can even get some of your favorites, just in more reasonable sizes, or with small changes (the chopped salad, for example, has a different, and equally delicious dressing).  And of course...dessert. I've had more cheesecake from CF than I care to admit, but they have all been great (even the sugar free options). I will say that all slices are generous and big enough to share for sure, but if you just can't agree on a flavor with your dining companion, it's not such a tragedy to take home some sweet leftovers! Service is always great here, the atmosphere is nice (active but not too loud)  There is almost always a wait, especially during peak meal hours and Sunday mornings. Sometimes you can find seating in the bar area without a wait, and they serve a full menu. Also - I know they used to do this, not sure if they still do, but they used to have a wonderful happy hour (from 4-6 on weeknights), where you could get smaller versions of the appetizers for a few bucks a piece.

Anywho... been here a couple of times since my last review and felt that it deserved an update.  It has either been a happy hour event... lunch or dinner with some GFs... the hubby will NOT come back here unless the meal will be free, so I guess that isn't happening anytime soon.  I love their Asian salad during lunch... its a pretty big portion and its delicious, plus the complimentary bread is pretty darn good.  I am also obsessed with the Fried Mac 'N Cheese balls.  I mean, you really can't go wrong with those 4 words, but they make it even better by having them sit in a bead of marinara.   Last time I was here I got the Garlic Noodles, which consisted of, you guessed it, garlic noodles, asparagus, tomatoes and mushrooms.  The portion was HUGE, lasted me three meals... but they definitely skimped on the veggies and this was a $13 dish.  My friends Romano Chicken looked to-die-for and, again, the portion was huge... but she was sick throughout the night.  Granted, we had drinks, appetizer, dinner, and cheesecake, so it could have been too much rich food.  And the cheesecake.... OMG heaven.  We had the Smores' one and we were just both blown away.  I wish I was eating it right now. It is a VERY expensive place, which sometimes drives me nuts cause its a chain in a freaking mall, but you definitely get what you pay for (here and there at least).  If you don't want to spend a ton, share a meal, there will be PLENTY of food for two people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=220,3.6,3.46,3.46,3.2120000000000006,3.5160000000000005
224,Stephen O.,"Memphis, TN",119,58,7.0,4.0,2013-09-26,"The secret to eating at the Cheesecake Factory is NEVER THINK ABOUT CALORIE COUNTS when eating there. Seriously. As long as you don't 'go there', you will have a superlative experience. We only waited about fifteen minutes and got our table. If you have not been to The Cheesecake Factory, let me illuminate you: you do not get a menu, you get a comprehensive breakdown of a variety of food cultures and genres. It is like War and Peace: The Menu. What I have discovered over the years is that the food is pretty amazing no matter what you get (astonishingly). Our server was somewhat *less* than amazing (pretty terrible actually) but since we had a few dozen pages of menu to read it wasn't so bad. We started out with the Tex Mex Eggrolls. You need these in your life. Spicy chicken, corn, black beans, cheese, with an avacado cream sauce and salsa?  Come ON. Next, I went for a Greek Salad  Unsurprisingly, I got extra dressing. I cannot recommend this greek salad enough. It is probably the best I have had, edging out Mellow Mushroom by a tiny bit. I have to admit I overdid it on the dressing at this place. My friends were both laughing about my greek ""soup"" when my salad was about half gone. That stuff was delicious though! For the record, I did not drink it hahaha. For an entree, my buddy and I both got the Stuffed Chicken Tortillas. It was basically corn tortillas containing spicy chicken and covered with melted cheese and cilantro and just ridiculously awesome. The corn cakes that came with it were almost as good as the tortillas themselves. I want to describe them further but... I cannot... it was just so good. I could not finish it but I wanted to! My roommate got the Baja Chicken Tacos which looked delicious and certainly less gut busting than our dinner. He said they were excellent. For dessert we of course got cheesecake, but I do not think any pictures exist (due to our inhalation of said cheesecake). I do not remember what I had, but it was amazing. We had our last adventure of the day trying to get a server to bring us our check. We were there pretty late and the place was shutting down, I think it probably took 20 minutes or more just to get a check, then 15 more to get it back and leave. If not for that service, this would have been a five star review.  Yes I know the Cheesecake Factory is a chain, but every time I go they knock the food out of the park.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=220,3.6,3.48,3.48,3.12,3.5280000000000005

222,Kate S.,"Schaumburg, IL",6,16,,3.0,2013-11-27,"Let me start by saying looking for the restaurant was like searching for the Ark of the Covenant, except for the whole ""finding it after all"" part. Maybe not exactly like the Ark...basically it's tricky to find. So if anyone else has trouble, it's next to the upper level entrance of Macy's in Woodfield Mall. Not the Streets of Woodfield, but Woodfield Mall itself. I can't fault The Cheesecake Factory for my geographic ineptitude. We called ahead to try and make a reservation for our group of 7, but they don't take reservations during their holiday season. When this actually starts and ends, I don't know. But we were still able to get a table. I asked my server right away about my allergies and what was safe for me (nuts and shellfish, for what it's worth). She was very knowledgeable, and told me the process in the kitchen for patrons with allergies, which I really appreciated. I felt taken care of. It's worth noting that the cheesecake itself isn't prepared in house, and has the standard ""may contain traces of"" warning associated with it. The table ordered a round of cocktails, and all were pretty great. I got the Asian Pear Martini, which contains sake, ""pear""  and ""passion fruit"" (who knows what that actually means, syrup or otherwise), vanilla vodka, and sake. The technical term for this is ""stupid delicious."" But everything we ordered was good - we did the ""pass to the left, try everything"" system. Other drinks included the signature margarita, a strawberry daiquiri, and a red sangria. After some liquid courage, I tackled the menu. It's 20 pages. This isn't an exaggeration - the menu is literally 20 pages long, containing all drinks and c-cakes. But holy selection. I finally settled on the pasta carbonara, which is spaghettini with smoked bacon, green peas, and a garlic-parmesan cream sauce. It was pretty great. Warm, creamy, bacony - it hit the spot on the coldest night ever on the face of this planet. Nothing to write home about, but it was tasty. As far as the cheesecakes, I ordered the tiramisu for myself and the banana cream for my boyfriend because I express feelings through food. The tiramisu was okay. It tasted like a normal, slightly bland cheesecake, without any of the amazing dark flavors of tiramisu. No espresso and a slight dusting of cocoa do not a tiramisu make. Overall it was tasty, but I don't see myself clamoring to go back, especially for the price. But it's fun for a casual night out with some ladyfriends to catch up before you break out the boxed wine. The service was the best part - the staff was incredibly friendly, helpful, and gave great suggestions. I wish I caught our server's name so I could give her her proper ups.

Sadly, either they have changed the recipe at all locations or perhaps this location cooks it differently. The portion was smaller than I remember it and the cajun spices had more of a heat flavor than cajun flavor. I'd be perfectly happy with Tony Cachere's spice mix than what they use now. The service was good but very slow. Towards the end we just wanted to get out and pay but had to wait 10 minutes to get a container for the leftovers.

First, though they're always crowded (what Cheesecake Factory isn't?) they do a great job setting expectations around wait-time, and then they beat that time.  Every time.  But that's really just putting years of research around perceived wait time to good use.  What made this visit different enough to warrant a review is Misty.   My mother has celiac disease, which has opened up a whole new perspective on service in restaurants.  Since ""gluten-free"" is the diet du jour, it's pretty easy to find GF items called out at most major restaurants.  The Cheesecake Factory is no exception, and has GF versions of many of their most popular dishes. Misty, who was our server for the first half of the meal, took things a step further.  She assured us that she not only placed the GF order, but also that she'd checked in to make certain my mother would be served the right version of her meal.  When she brought bread to the table, she brought my mother a basket of chips and salsa.  That was huge.  My mom's used to sitting patiently while the rest of us knock out a bread basket, and having chips brought with the bread had a big impact.  It showed that Misty understood what gluten free is all about, and how it feels to have a dietary restriction that conflicts with standard restaurant protocol.   This was a big win, and such a small gesture that made my mother feel like part of the table.  Kudos to Misty for taking care of the people, rather than just delivering our orders.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=220,3.64,3.49,3.49,3.0280000000000005,3.5500000000000003

The place was a zoo! Worse than the parking lot, which took over 20 minutes to find a spot. Even after out pager was buzzed, we stood around like it was some kind of cattle call.  We finally were seated and waters were put in front of us, but no one introduced themselves as our server for almost an hour! When we finally flagged someone over, the waitor said ""Oh, I just didn't want to interrupt you guys talking."" No, let's be honest- you forgot about us and don't want to admit it. But thanks for lying to our faces instead of living up to your mistake.  We quickly put in an app order. Not once were we asked if we'd like anything else to drink, so we just sipped our water the whole time were were there. The app came pretty quickly, but then our food order wasn't taken until about a half hour after our app was finished.  I wanted to order a chicken salad sandwhich off the skinnylicious menu. I asked to sub the salad for the sweet potato fries. I was told it's the exact same sandwich on the regular menu. I was thinking they used light mayo, etc. Apparently the only thing ""skinny"" about this menu is the side is chosen for you- you get a green salad.  After another long wait, my friends' food was brought out and not mine. They politely waited for mine to come out while theirs got cold. My sandwich came- light my ass! It was SMOTHERED in mayo and the bread had butter oozing out of it. It was disgustng. I couldn't even eat it after all that wait. To top it off, my fries came out when my friends had already finished their meals.  I can't believe I paid over $20 for a disgusting ""meal"" and 2 eggrolls. IF I EVER decide to go back, I will be going to the one downtown or in Oak Brook.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=220,3.28,3.46,3.46,2.372,3.3880000000000003

He sent it back. My nieces friend was joining us because they were in from college on spring break.  She ordered the Shrimp Scampi.  In her dish she found a broken toothpick.  At this point we asked for the manager.  The manager came over and apologized said he would take her meal off the bill and asked if she wanted more pasta. She declined.  Meanwhile my husband still did not receive his meal.  Please understand my husband is also diabetic and luckily had not taken his insulin.  As everyone finished their meal my husband requested the manager again.  He requested that they cancel his meal because everyone else was already done. They apologized again and then took off his meal as well.  My sister insisted on them giving us some free deserts.  They did give us some free deserts.  Even with that our bill was +$200.00 and my husband (Who paid the bill) ended up completely aggravated and   eating a sandwich when we got home.  Not the way we wanted  to celebrate the spring break visit with my niece.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=420,3.28,3.42,3.42,2.2760000000000002,3.3640000000000003

After eating here recently and getting severely ill from the food, I'm not only disappointed in the restaurant, but also in the way the manager handled the incident. My advice is first- stay away from the seafood entrees. The Bistro Shrimp pasta made me the sickest I've ever been in my life- and resulted in a 4-day stomach virus. When I called the manager to report this, his tone was accusatory and all he offered was a ""small gift certificate"" and a follow-up phone call -- both of which were never received.

Now it's a Saturday and as expected there was a wait so we walked around the mall to kill some time. An hour later we get sat. As you can imagine we were all fairly hungry and looking forward to a hearty dinner. Our server greets our table(Kim) and she seems less than excited to be working. We ordered drinks and two appetizers right away. She does inform us that the kitchen is backed up and food was coming out slowly.  Fifteen minutes later one of our two appetizers hits the table. Kim thought it was better to have one than none which was strange but we dealt with it. We place out entree order and continue to eat our now delivered second appetizer.  This is where the wheels begin to fall off. Our entrees begin to get delivered but not all at once. Two entrees show up and that's it. Three minutes later a third shows up. Finally our server comes over and apologizes that the fourth entree still isn't delivered. She explains that it will be up shortly. Two different people have stopped by and finally fifteen minutes later the fourth entree is delivered. At this point in extremely aggregated, our server sees this and sends over the manager Jesse.  Jesse comes by and does that annoying table knee and asks ""what going on folks? Sorry about the delay in your food.""  I explain that we intended to eat together. As to not be rude the entire table had waited for the last entree before we began to eat. As you can imagine the other entrees had become cold. Jesse decided that the most important thing to do was offer free cheesecake. I explain to Jesse that we haven't eaten yet and cheesecake was the last thing on our minds. I understand that the restaurant was busy but the manner in which the food was delivered was unacceptable. He agreed and promptly exited.  For whatever reason Kim(server) had become very standoffish.  She doesn't check back for quite awhile and when she does she offers cheesecake again.  We politely decline and ask for our check. We pay our check, and keep in mind, there was no compensation whatsoever.  As we are walking out I stop at the host stand and ask for the general managers information. The host feverishly looks for a business card. As we are patiently waiting, another manager(Kim) asks if she can do anything for us. I explain that we were just waiting for a business card for the GM because our experience was awful.  She looks surprised apologizes and immediately walks away.

143,Christine L.,"Skokie, IL",122,399,828.0,3.0,2014-09-29,"This place always seems packed, and somehow we end up here during their busier times.  Our 15 to 20 minute estimated wait time turned into 30. The place itself is fairly dimly lit, with your typical Cheesecake Factory decor.  Mirrors make the place seem more spacious, and there are a number of TVs in the bar area.  When it is busy it gets pretty noisy. Our typical appetizer when we go with friends is the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes (three tamale cakes in one appetizer), which is really good.  This last time I was here I also ordered the Meat Loaf, not what I would typically order at Cheesecake, but I hadn't had it in a while and was craving something comforting.  And what isn't more comforting than meat loaf and mashed potatoes? The meat loaf came on what seemed like a platter, which is consistent with Cheesecake Factory's large portions.  It included a large scoop of mashed potatoes, four slabs of meat loaf, and a corn succotash.  Definitely enough for two meals (unless you are really hungry).  While cheesecake tends to be a little pricey, they do make up with it with their portion sizes. For dessert I ordered the Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake which, for someone like me who can't decide what to order most of the time, fits the bill perfectly: ""Layers of moist chocolate cake, chewy brownie, toasted coconut-pecan frosting and creamy chocolate chip coconut cheesecake"".  With cake, brownie, and cheesecake all in one, I get a little bit of everything.

119,Claire M.,"Forest Park, IL",145,353,392.0,3.0,2014-11-21,"I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in quite a long time.  I'm not particularly sure why, though I'm not a huge fan of cheesecake (unless it's ALL chocolate) but I realize cheesecake is only one part of their menu, which as we all know, is rather extensive.  I don't DISLIKE it, but after I stopped eating meat 6 and a half years ago, I was unable to eat what I usually would order which was the delicious ""crusted chicken romano"" or something like that. I found myself out in Schaumburg for some reason last weekend and when lunchtime approached, somehow this was the selected venue.  I must have been in an especially agreeable mood.  While it appeared to be freakishly crowded in there, the wait for two was only 10 minutes, but I think we waited 15 or 20, still no big deal.     I think the last time I was at one of these places (the one in Oak Brook maybe?) I ordered one of those flatbreads and it was good, but I don't find flatbreads to be too terribly exciting.  This time, I went for the veggie burger.  I've had many a veggie burger in my day, some good, some bad, some downright awful.  It's always a gamble for me.  This one, as described in the menu, sounded rather intriguing.  This is what it said:  A Delicious ""Burger"" Made with Brown Rice, Farro, Couscous, Mushrooms, Black Beans & Onion. Served on a Toasted Bun with Lettuce, Tomato, Red Onion, Pickles & Mayo. Served with a Green Salad.  I ordered it without mayo (because I think it's disgusting) and got it with fontina cheese.   And whatever that brown bread is they serve, it's delicious, I love it, and I eat too much of it.  But if there's any treat in eating there, it's that.   Our waiter kept apologizing to us for the wait.  It didn't feel like things were taking a long time, but I think we were there for about two hours.  I didn't care, but I asked for ketchup to douse my burger in and never got it so I ended up consuming it without.  It was still delicious, but would've been even better with ketchup. We got cheesecake to go (so full).  Hershey's chocolate for me, pumpkin for the other one.   I'm slightly more frugal now, so I always wince a little when the check comes because it's always more than I think it should be - and we didn't order appetizers or drinks.   The only somewhat annoying thing that happened was that there were sooooooooooo many screaming babies and children there at the same time we were.  So I was hearing surround sound of crying pretty much the entire time.  The kid at the table behind us kept throwing things which of course ended up right at our table.  Was it bitchy of me to not pick anything up for the parents?  Well, I didn't.  It wouldn't have been sanitary.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=100,2.72,3.2,3.2,2.8920000000000003,3.0080000000000005

I've been here twice now but can't say that the food or service is anything I'd return often for, but the selection is vast and I'll give the benefit of the doubt that I just haven't found my dish yet.  I tried the avocado eggroll appetizer after seeing it pop up in many reviews. It tasted like guacamole stuffed inside a thick eggroll wrapper, not bad but not great. Tip: go easy with the dipping sauce! It is overwhelmingly sweet. I ordered the chicken stuffed tortillas, an enchilada type dish made with melted cheese and tomatillo sauce over four corn tortillas stuffed with (not very)spicy chicken. Also just mediocre. The pasta dishes seem to be consistently good. My friend ordered miso salmon which is served over rice. The salmon was good but the bed of rice it was served over was horribly undercooked. It says it comes with snow peas but it looked like the few snow peas that came with the dish was just for garnish.  I hope to update this review after I've tried more of their desserts, though!

Seated immediately, greeted upon being seated and welcomed by our waiter, George.  He put up with our tables incredible gift of gab, as we thumbed through the dictionary of deliciousness (menu).  The bread and butter they serve (complimentary) hold a very special place in my heart- especially the honey wheat. And the warm and colorful ambiance is the perfect backdrop to great conversation and food. It wasn't my first time here, it probably was close to the 200th time that I've dined here. It was, however, the first time I've ever ordered a glass of wine. The Pino noir was decadent and only $10.50 for a glass. We shared the corn tamale cakes- which never cease to amaze. The sweet and warm coupled with the cool creaminess of the sour cream and avocado.... Infringes upon perfection. I ordered the jerked pepper shrimp dish, which was super rich, very flavorful and the plantains on the side rounded out the dinner, quite nicely. My friend ordered the chicken Bellagio- which was a generous serving of tender chicken over pasta, with Parmesan cheese and arugula salad on top. Fresh and delicious. Seeing as how we stuffed ourselves on the bread, tamale cakes and giant dinner portions, we didn't have room for dessert. So we reached down to our inner fat kids and ordered three slices to go. Pineapple upside down cheesecake.  Taking two phenomenal deserts and scientifically combining them to create an unbelievable treat sensation... How is this the first time I'm trying it?! I didn't share. In fact- I want another.  From beginning to end, the entire meal was spot on. Way to always be a high scoring restaurant, and a favorite.

In a classy place like that I would expect the servers to look very clean and sharp.  I ordered the habachi steak and it was very good! It was served with mashed potatoes and two deep fried asparagus which were only there for garnish it seemed. I would've preferred a bigger serving of vegetable and not deep fried. My dad got some Jamaican jerk dish with shrimp and chicken. There was not enough meat at all and it wasn't all that great. We both got a slice of cheesecake. They do not offer a complimentary birthday dessert. My dad got a peanut butter, chocolate slice that was way to sweet for him and I believe it only had one tiny layer that was actually cheesecake.

After three consecutive years of bad experiences at Claim Jumper on Rt 59, we can't seem to settle on one place. We've been on the lookout but   we continue to change locations year after year. That's not necessarily a bad thing because we get to try new or less frequented restaurants as a family, annually. The kids are still young (one of them still believes in Santa) so choosing a restaurant that accomodates kids' taste in food without compromising the quality of service and ambiance that fits my sister and her husband's budget can be challenging. Fortunately, the perimeter that covers our area for good eats is the Northwest Suburbs. It's a huge territory with a cornicopia of restaurants. It continues to develop and grow to rival with Chicago's best. When we finally settled on The Cheesecake Factory, I was relieved and actually happy with the choice we made. My usual complaint that the menu has too much variety of dishes, accomodated all eight of us to find something satisfying: Angel hair pasta plates, red meat with a side, a turkey burger with a side,  seafood with a side and 2 baskets of warm loaves of white and brown bread served with room temperature butter. Some of us started with an adult beverage, I had a Coke straight up with ice. The kids had iced water.  After finishing our entrees, no one says they don't have room for dessert to share. I mean, the name of this restaurant is a dessert. Who disagrees with me that it would make sense to eat at a place famous for their dessert and skip ordering one? The way they have the cheesecakes displayed, just off to the side of the hostess' stand and set up like a retail shop with its own staff and cashiers, it's easy to just stop in, place an order for a slice and go! By the way, thank you for listening to my first review.

Just the right amount of sweet and loaded with plenty of chicken and shrimp. As an appetizer, the Buffalo Blasts are a must. The ambience is dark and loud, the service is top notch, food is delicious with large portions, and the wait times can get heavy because of the mall traffic.

On a whim last night, I suggested my family and I go here to try it out.  We were almost immediately seated, which was nice considering Woodfield is typically busy, even on week nights. I didn't realize how huge the restaurant was from the outside- holy crap! It's quite dim, which I love, and is fancier than I thought it would be.  I wish I could remember our waiter's name because he was fabulous. It's as if he knew exactly how many times to come to the table, the perfect amount of wait time before refilling drinks, etc. The best service I have ever had at a restaurant!  Now onto the food...ugh. Amazing. At first I was a little skeptical due to how huge the menu is and how many different cuisines they offer (Italian, Asian, Mexican, American, etc). I've noticed that when a restaurant has too large of a menu, the food isn't always great. I ordered the avocado egg rolls to start, even though my family thought it was an odd appetizer. We were all surprised at not only how quickly the appetizer came, but how DELICIOUS the egg rolls were. The sauce is to-die-for. The ""black"" bread was great as well and the butter was warm. Seems stupid, but I hate when butter is cold and won't spread on your bread!  I am a veggie burger junkie, and in my opinion, they're very easy to mess up. They're either flavorless and falling apart all over the place or perfect. Let me say, this one was perfect! It did fall apart a bit, but it didn't bother me at all because it was full of flavor. The dipping sauce that comes with it is fantastic too. I got sweet potato fries for the side, which I'm also obsessed with, and they were amazing! Simple, but they complemented the burger very nicely. The proportions are also huge, seems to be a theme here! I think the cheesecake speaks for itself, but my favorites are the Oreo and lemon meringue.  All in all, I plan on going back for my birthday in April. There are so many things I want to try, but the veggie burger was so good that I may just have to stick with that!

My friend at one of the lunch specials (sandwich, salad, and soup) which was so much food, and I went with the Avocado Eggrolls that so many people recommended. They were delicious, but a little heavy on the cilantro for my taste (but I'm not a huge cilantro fan). Then we each had a slice of cheesecake- she had some sort of chocolate madness that I would not have been able to eat (wow- so much chocolate), and I tried a new one for me- Key Lime Cheesecake. It was the perfect cheesecake texture and taste- and I loved every bite! I had several eggrolls and half a slice of cheesecake to take home as their portions are abnormally large.

The ONLY reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because of our waitress, Tiffany. We sat in the bar and there were not a lot of people in there so it was a nice area. She comes to the table with a very rude ""what can I get you guys to drink?"" The tone in her voice was enough for me to be able to tell she did not want to serve us/be there. Didn't even tell us her name. She comes back almost 10 mins later with our drinks. We order our appetizer, she asks us if we're ready to order our entrees and we ask for a little more time. She sighs as she basically runs away after that, then doesn't come back for probably another 15 mins. She basically had an attitude the whole time we were there. I'm a server and this is not the way to take care of a table, especially when your trying to get a tip. I would think Cheesecake Factory would have higher standards for their servers. The only reason I even got her name was because it was on the receipt.  On to the food, we got the tex mex eggrolls as our appetizer and they were delicious, especially the avocado sauce that comes on the side. I got the pasta carbonara which was the best pasta I think I've ever had honestly. And my friend got the chicken madeira which was also very good. Then we got the 30th anniversary chocolate cake cheesecake and the carrot cake cheesecake and they were both amazing.  Of course I will come back, hopefully I will get a server who actually cares about their job or at least their tip so I can feel welcomed there because it really does help the experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=300,3.56,3.24,3.368,3.216,3.3680000000000008

Finally, I flagged someone down - turns out it was the waiter. He did clean it off and about 5 min later - the busser wandered into the area.  Server was nice but clearly overwhelmed a he tried to serve 10 tables. This resulted in LONG waits for drinks. And, since we were in the bar area we could see our drinks but we couldn't get our drinks - just got to watch the ice melt as the drinks got watered down. Food was ""ok"" - it wasn't anything I'd run back for. We ordered the lettuce wraps and, frankly, I have had better. Seemed like we had way more wrap ( lettuce) than filling to put in wrap. And once finished, we had the appetizer plate on the table for the entire meal because the busser was not interested in bussing tables and, apparently, the food runners don't take empty plates away.  I ordered a blue cheese flatbread as meal. Topping was ok but flatbread was burnt. Daughter had the kids Mac and cheese - it was kind of dry - not creamy like Mac and cheese should be. Husband had a sandwich which was ok. I think our server tried his best but he had way too many tables so he could not effectively provide great customer service. The busser really didn't proactively look for things to do - he had to be specifically asked to take care of stuff. Other staff members would walk by but didn't help out. In the end, I think there was a lack of teamwork or cohesion in the staff - resulting in a less than satisfactory experience.

This is the second time we've chosen The Cheesecake Factory as our meeting spot and we were once again not disappointed. We had first gone to the one in Oakbrook but our experience here wasn't too much different.  I've been to this location a few times and there's always been a wait. This time it was about 55 min and they told us it would be 40. Now I totally understand that you can't force people to get up and leave but it was a long wait and it was already 7pm so we were hungry! I wish the bar area was bigger so we could have a drink or they had that new technology where they could text us that our table was ready so we didn't have to wait on the buzzer. (We couldn't shop while we waited because the range wasn't far enough) Anyway! Aside with my annoyance with the wait everything else was great! Our waiter Gareth, I believe was his name? Was awesome and he had a cool accent which my friend loved and he was very patient with my weird food requests which I'm sure are annoying so thank you! He also went on break during our dinner so we had a fill in waitress for our table and she was very nice as well so we got lucky! We had the Simosas to start and both my friends got the BLTs which were huge and I had the Mac and Cheese burger. My beef patty was a little more cooked than I wanted but still totally edible and not worth the fuss of sending it back. Their sweet potato fries are my favorite! Good dinner and very friendly service. The only reason they're getting 4 stars instead of 5 is because I'm a brat and don't like waiting that long, we got there at 6:45 and didn't leave till 9:30, I wish they took reservations because we knew 3 days ahead of time we'd go there but otherwise everything was awesome.

The host took us to a table all the way in the back. My sisters and I just looked at each other bc we all thought it was weird that he passed so many empty tables to sit us all the way at the last table in the rear of the restaurant.  A waitress came and greeted us, and brought a round of waters back. 10mins go by and she hasn't returned yet. We see her coming back our way and we get her attention, we ask if we can order our appetizers now and she says ""I'm not your waiter"" we say ............""ok well can you get the person who'll be our waiter??? We've been waiting for like 15mins and no one has came to our table."" She says it was a change in shifts so she'll go get our new waiter. 15mins later our new waitress is at our table.  Now we're just ready to eat so we order our entrées. My sister has her son with us so she asks if his food can be brought out as soon as it's done. I order a falafel salad. She orders a fried chicken sandwich and everyone else has some sort of pasta. My nephew's food arrives 20mins later along with his mothers food. 10mins later a pasta plate comes out. 15mins later my mom & little sisters dish comes out. Everyone has their food except Me and all I had was a salad.  The waitress asks ""oh did your salad come out?"" ....... Well of course it didn't I don't have it, I do t even have a plate in front of me. It's now been about 50mins and she finally comes back with my salad, which I'm sure was just sitting back there waiting to get picked up. I took one bite of the falafel and it was not even crispy. I asked for it to be sent back and for management.  The manger comes to our table and is actually the same person who sat us all the way in the back and gives me attitude. I told him about the long wait and how we've been there for like 2hrs and everyone's food coming out one at a time and me receiving a salad an hour later that should've  taken no time to come out.

The waiter comes back gives our drinks and while me and my gf took a sip I was like this ain't no cola but a mix of cola and MINERAL water and I noticed the different light color of the drink.

257,Kristi H.,"Carol Stream, IL",0,3,,2.0,2016-01-03,"I so wanted to love my Cheesecake Factory experience tonight but, unfortunately, that was not the case.  After reading the reviews, I had resigned myself to the idea of a long wait; however, we were seated quickly. We arrived at 430 on a Sunday to a packed lobby. But we put our name in and were seated within 15 minutes. So fantastic, right? Wrong. We were seated in a booth directly across from the kitchen entrance. You know the one, every restaurant has one. It's almost an afterthought booth, as if the builder looked at the blueprint, saw an empty space, and decided to stick something there to fill it up. Gah. So noisy with dishes being thrown around that I couldn't hear the conversation of my table mates, and the constant line of servers walking past like soldiers marching in formation was actually stirring up a breeze. By the time the smirking server arrived at our table and proceeded to describe the daily special of salmon something or other and pronounced the word salmon with an audible ""L"", I was ready to move. The hostess came over, found us a fantastic spot far away from the kitchen, and helped us move our drinks and menus. Hooray! But then... We placed our order. Knowing it might be a while on this busy Sunday, we ordered the sweet corn tamale cakes appetizer with no cilantro. Then each of us ordered an entree. The tamale cakes came out covered with cilantro. The server took them back to the kitchen to have them remade. By the time they came back out to the table, we already had our entrees. And no appetizer plates. No biggie, we all ate the appetizer from the serving dish. And, truth be told, the appetizer was the best part of the meal. It would have tasted even better if the dish had been comp'd for our trouble, but it wasn't.  The entrees: kid's pizza, steak Diane, falafel salad, and an order of pot stickers were all just meh. The one alcoholic drink I ordered was rather weak and I was never offered a second. Which I wasn't sure if I should be mad or glad about once I saw the $10.25 price tag for what was essentially a vodka lemonade. The others had soft drinks that were never refilled. And the list goes on... So, overall, a 2 star experience for short wait time and food that was edible. The kitchen mistakes, meal timing, inattentive wait staff, and food quality for value makes up for the other three missed stars. Sorry, Cheesecake Factory, I would have to say that I'll skip a return trip. Oh, and don't bother ordering the key lime cheesecake.  This did not even remotely resemble cheesecake. It was a tall serving of soft key lime pie. Like key lime pudding. Mush. Not good when you are expecting a piece of key lime flavored cheesecake. I would think, out of the whole meal, that The Cheesecake Factory would get the cheesecake right. Sigh.

Plenty of pasta some are veggie pasta and others are plain topped with a spicy jambalaya sauce chopped onions and bell peppers with plum tomatoes with a couple of whole shrimp and chunks of chicken breast.

I went for the typical tomatoes, mozzarella and basil. The dish was a bruschetta on steroids and delicious to boot. We were too full to order cheesecake.

Didn't catch her name, but she answered all our questions, smiled almost nonstop, and helped us decide on dessert. I ordered a Cuban sandwich (also a first for me) and it was really good! The only negative thing I have to say about that though is the bread was literally painful to bite into because it was toasted, thick, and super crunchy. I wouldn't hesitate to order the Cuban again if the bread was softer. And omg those fries!!! Golden, delicious, fresh, and perfect with the ketchup they provided. I ordered the Black Out cake for dessert and took it home. Now that I've dug into it as a midnight snack, omg... Chocolate lover's heaven. It does contain nuts on the outer part though so beware if you have a nut allergy. The entire visit for 4 people: 4 waters, 1 Coke, 1 lemonade, 4 entrees, and 4 slices of cheesecake/regular cake = $100+ tab. Overall, I was really impressed.

I had a burger, which was ordered medium-rare but served well-done. The meat was good, though. The fries, however, were terrible. They tasted like the oil had not been changed recently. I am really not a big eater but I generally finish what I was served. This time, I left the fries after eating only a few. I struggled with how to rate my experience. I like going to Cheesecake Factories that I have been to in other cities. I have good experiences there. This particular one I have had run-ins with before when I did complain about the food. One time, the general manager even stepped in saying I was being unreasonable - I have a food allergy and when they disregarded that and served the meal wrong, he belittled it, refused to replace it and charged us anyway.

We felt very ignored for most of the night. Overall service was very very slow. First, she messed up our order and brought us the wrong cheesecake. I give it to her for remembering 3 out of the 4 that we ordered. It might've helped if she wrote it down. It took forever to get 4 slices of cheesecake. Seriously should not take like half an hr for that... Then, we couldn't even tell her about her mistake because she never came to our table. It was impossible to get her attention. It was not that busy when we were there either. So finally, we get her attention and she takes it away (brand new, we didn't touch it). We got the correct order like 15 minutes later... and it was nasty. It was too sweet and none of us liked it, but we didn't want to send it back. Idk why people I'm with don't like sending food back, but anyway! 4 slices for $40 is basically a rip off, but we still like to go here because sometimes it's good and we were really craving cheesecake.   I find that at this cheesecake factory, the service is always bad. Whether you spend $40 or $200... I get it that they're really busy sometimes, but you don't wanna feel like you're inconveniencing them by being there and that's how I've felt twice so far. And this is spaced out like a year apart.

Cheesecake Factory has great cheesecake and has an expansive menu, however for the price and food experience, the are a lot of other options that can surpass the Cheesecake Cake.  But if you want consistency, comfortability (in regards to flavor and food), and lot of (safe) options, I would recommend the Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg,3.12,3.33,3.292,2.9880000000000004,3.246

He comes back with drinks about 5 minutes later and walks away without saying a word. Another 5 minutes goes by and he brings bread (which was awful by the way. Hard, cold bread and frozen butter? Not a great mix. Not his fault though) and leaves before we can tell him we would like an appetizer. We sat there in silence for 20 minutes and there was still no sign of our server.

165,Erinn P.,"Palatine, IL",122,7,1.0,2.0,2017-03-12,"So my family and I came here to celebrate  my sister getting married. When we first came in the  staff told us it would be an hr wait, since we had no other place in mind we decided to wait the hr. Little did we know that would turn into 1hr and 45 min of waiting not just an hr. That was just the start of this night. Don't get me wrong I understand the places in the mall get busy but this was just a crazy amount of time waisted. We  finally get a seat, at this point we are STARVING there are five of us waiting to chow. We were offered bread at our table and only got ONE basket for five people... after waiting 1hr and 45 min .... that was not enough for all 5 of us. We start looking at our meal options and my cousins opens her menu to a huge slab of butter smashed inbetween her menu, kinda gross not gonna lie. I decided I'd go ask for a new one and hit the bathrooms on my way. Not only was there a line in the bathroom ( understandable) but there was NO TOLIET paper in any of the bathroom stalls but ONE! I then went back up front to let someone know that the bathrooms are empty of toilet paper ( and to be honest they were a mess). After getting back to the table I was asked what I wanted to eat and I also asked for an ice tea that took about 25 min to even arrive after I was told by my waiter he forgot. Well that's not the only thing he forgot ... my meal didn't come out with everyone els food cuz they forgot... or maybe sent it to the wrong table because i saw someone else's food wondering around that night as well. I was pretty upset at this point that even the free crappy side salad didn't help. Best part of the night was that NONE of my food was free even tho it was late and someone els got my food  and I had to then wait even longer to eat after waiting so long to sit down. We all ordered desert and the part that blows my mind after all this crap is that our waiter forgot to add a peace of cheese cake to our tab came over AND GAVE my mom a new bill... no offense but that's super shitty after all the crap we went through that night.... shitty company for not givin me either my cheese cake or meal for free ...

The food has always been wonderful, and the cheesecakes are divine. My husband and I went last night, and we had a short 20min wait for a table, which isn't bad. We ordered the Vietnamese Summer Rolls as an appetizer. The rolls were delicious, and my favorite sauce was the peanut. My husband loved the spicy chili sauce. The vegetables were fresh and tasty, my only complaint was the skin they used to wrap the roll was overly sticky and thin, so everything kept falling out. For the entree, I ordered the Miso Salmon with Brown Rice. The fish was cooked nicely and the flavors were good. I wish there were more snow peas, but I just ordered a side of asparagus to get my veggie fix. My husband ordered a Shrimp Scampi, and he liked it more than than the Shrimp with Angel Hair that he used  to get. He said the Scampi had stronger flavors. Just a note the Scampi is breaded and lightly fried, so if you don't want fried shrimp get the Shrimp with Angel Hair. There was so much food we didn't even get a chance to order cheesecake.

So they don't take reservations which I get because people flock here like cattle so need for them to bother with them.  When we finally did get seated and 30 minutes later got to order our drinks and an appetizer, seemed like a little much, I mean I get that you're busy but 30 minutes?  Really? The crab artichoke appetizer we got was a big plate of mayo, couldn't even taste the crab or artichoke. Fast forward 45 minutes we got another round of drinks and finally got to place our entree order...again I mean come on the service is laughable at this point. So the turkey burger I ordered was like a little frown dried out hockey puck and was all around terrible, the good news was the the other four people in my party seemed ok with their food so I guess that works. We took five slices of cheesecake home and I will say, they were delicious, the names fits for sure they know their way around cheesecake.

The Kobe burger was delicious but nothing that was jaw dropping but it is the quality that you pay for. The only aspect that could have improved was the customer service.

I tried their Nashville hot chicken nuggets which aren't a regular menu offering. We all really enjoyed these, great sauce and flavour. I got the Fresh Country Salad from their skinnylicious menu and would get it again. The rest of my family all got sandwiches with a salad.

We were seated in a booth for 6 even though there were 4 of us. This was nice because we could spread out.  Our server came and got our drink order. I appreciate that he could tell we were chatting quite a bit and was very polite about it. He took our orders. I ordered a salad that I wanted out before my food. The salad was good, I always get it when I come here, but no one ever cleared the plate. Even when the main food came no one took the salad plate. After a while 2 of the 4 plates were brought out. It was over 5 minutes before mine and my husbands grandma's food came out. The manager (I assume) stopped by after about 3-5 minutes when we asked where the other 2 meals were he said that the chef couldn't send out the missing omelette because it didn't look good enough to be sent out....AKA it wasn't done right. We appreciated that but at the same time we could have been notified sooner and also there was no reason why my shrimp tacos were brought out late.

So what I absolutely loved about this place was that they have two entire menus. One of the menus is called the ""Skinnylicious Menu"" and it is a menu with appetizers, salads, pastas, fish, meat, entrees, etc that range from  100 to 800 calories. If you are someone who likes to eat healthy or are on a diet and are trying to limit your calorie intake then I would suggest this place!  I ordered from the Skinnylicious menu a turkey and avocado sandwich with a salad as my side. The sandwich was well toasted and they filled it up with a ton of turkey and avocado. Now the only reason I am not giving this place 5 stars is because even though the sandwich was good it was not anything that tasted different or better from what I could have made at home. My boyfriend did not order from the Skinnylicious menu, but the regular menu (which also displays how many calories every single dish has!). He ordered the Seared Ahi Tuna and it was pretty much 4 medium pieces of tuna on top of some white rice! The tuna was very tasty and fresh! Loved this dish!

Parking here can be done only through the Woodfield Mall parking lot which can either really suck or it can not suck as much if you can get good parking. I do love that the restaurant has allocated parking spots for patrons who order takeout which is also awesome! I do recommend that they offer some sort of valet parking option but I guess that option isn't as easy at this location (Oakbrook location has valet).  The inside of this restaurant is beautiful like all the other Cheesecake Factory locations. This location,to me, is just a little smaller though. On a busy night it's hard to find a place to sit down while waiting for a table but they do have a coat closet which is cool . I usually call ahead of time to hold a table if I have a large party.  Okay all the waitstaff here are very good at what they do! This place is usually busy and these fellas still get everything about your order correct! Drinks are brought out fast and the food also arrives pretty quickly. I like that they always check in on the tables frequently but not too much ya know? The bust boys turn over tables quickly too! Overall, you can expect a cash money experience here!  The menu here is huge! The drink selection too is fantastic! I usually stick to a water with lemon  and the lemons are cut like a wedge which I love because other restaurants usually just give you a sad little slice:( the strawberry lemonade is pretty dank here though so give that a try! All of the portions from the appetizers to the main dishes are very big! I love the avocado rolls here with that delicious cilantro dipping sauce... the dynamite shrimp is also great! If you're watching calories, then look no further because they also got a skinny menu (the shrimp  scampi is phenomenal). When I'm feeling extra, I usually opt in for the steak Diane/ salmon combo with asparagus and mashed potatoes with no mushrooms  (ew). This is frick'n awesome dish!!  The salmon melts in your mouth with herbal flavor and the light sauce leaves your palette satisfied! The steak is cooked to perfection all the time and is already cut up! This place also does brunch on Sunday but I haven't tried it yet. I will update this review once I've tried the brunch. Now for the real reason why everyone comes to the Factory of Cheesecake: the cheesecake!

88,T ..,"Chicago, IL",0,3,,1.0,2017-10-13,"We visited this location in Sept 2017.  I ordered the pork chop (which I've had at the Old Orchard location and it was delicious).  The pork chop was overcooked, dry and flavorless.  The mashed potato and broccoli were good.  My sister ordered the lettuce Mexican tacos.  Part way through her meal, she thought there may be cabbage on the tacos (she is allergic to cabbage - think food poisoning symptoms).  The menu did not show cabbage was in this meal.  She asked the waitress (Jessica) and she confirmed with the kitchen it was cabbage.  She apologized and asked if she wanted to order a different meal.    Jessica was nice, asked if my sister was ok and was apologetic.  Our meal was ruined, as we had to leave immediately; not to mention the illness to come for my sister.  We asked to speak to the manager. Enter Chad Grimes, store manager.  (Who, by the way, should secure a job that does not require him to interact with customers.)  He walks up to the table and asks - ""Are we the table with the tacos and is allergic to cabbage?"".  Without a response, he continues to state with ZERO sincerity or even the slightest inflection in his voice, ""I'm sorry.""  Obviously he was not sorry, but I would've expected him to pretend a bit more effectively.  A conversation recap - we expressed concern that cabbage was not listed in the menu nor would one expect cabbage on a Mexican taco.   We acknowledged that it's certainly not his fault, but perhaps this should be addressed with the appropriate person at the corporate level.   His responses with profound apathy - not all ingredients are listed, this has been discussed with corporate and there's nothing he can do.  Of course he would not charge us for the taco dish that made my sister ill.  We paid for my bland pork chop and left.  It's too bad that we'll never go to this restaurant again.  Had Chad been able to demonstrate that he cared at least a little bit and offered something of value to maintain the customer relationship - we may have given the place another try.  Poor Chad, stuck in a job that requires him to work with people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=60,3.76,3.37,3.276,,3.5260000000000002

Then after re-ordering they brought 3 dinners to the table - waited about 10 minutes for my dinner to come while everyone elses got cold. The tacos were sooooo tiny and they put all the ingredients on them that I asked not to have put on. Aggravating. When I went to restroom they were out of service - wont go into detail. But the best is when I spoke with the manager on my way out - blonde lady her only response was ""sorry about that.""

I ordered the Tex-Mex eggrolls as a ""light"" meal.  They were super greasy (there was so much oil in the bottom of the bowl, that I could cook a whole dinner in it!), but also super delicious! My sister is ""eating clean,"" for 6 months, in order to heal her gut, and so she ordered a veggie omelet, no cheese, with a side of potatoes (per request, not cooked in butter).  The omelet was dry only because she couldn't order any cheese.  It wasn't TCF's fault.  But she did say the veggies were tasty!  The potatoes also had a unique seasoning to them and she raved about them.   Of course, I couldn't leave a Cheesecake Factory without getting a slice (and regretfully eating it in front of my poor sister...).  The salted caramel slice was pretty good, but I actually like my homemade samoa cheesecake better (which I still had a half of left at home from Thanksgiving!).
