I've always enjoyed their great food and good portion sizes.  Many items are generous enough to be shared.  The giant menu allows everyone to find something that they like.  If you have any room left after your meal you can share a slice of cheesecake or take one to go! We visit both this location and the one at the Biltmore often and both are nice.  Even though the restaurant is quite large, there can still be a wait.  So reservations or call-ahead dining would be a nice addition. Here are some of my favorites from their menu - it's always hard to choose just one. Luau Salad  Grilled Shrimp and Bacon Club Sandwich  Shrimp with Angel Hair Pasta Low Carb Cheesecake is delicious too!  They use crushed walnuts instead of graham crackers for the crust.

The app of grilled artichokes were brought out and about 10 minutes later our food.  The food is always good and generous portion sizes and reasonably priced. The bf had the BBQ chicken pizza, which is always amazing but this time was especially good by his comments. I enjoyed the lettuce wrapped chicken tacos (asian).   Overall, this experience was as good as it usually is.  The only downside is the restaurant is always very VERY loud and table space is very small if you are not seated in a booth (we were not).

232,Nick J.,"Milwaukee, WI",72,46,11.0,2.0,2012-06-09,"I usually am pleased by The Cheesecake Factory but this time I will say it was a horrible experience. First off it was my mistake going on a friday night and waiting 30min to get seated but then after being seated it took another 20min just for someone to come and ask if there was anything that we wanted to drink. Finally after ordering it took forever to get the food AND it was the complete wrong appetizer, not once but twice. Usually when you receive your food asa common curtesy your asked if everything looks alright or how it is. Well not once were we asked. Lets just say the service was beyond awful. The drinks, well i can say that the drinks are always good, this time i ordered the green tea which was great and it was delicious. The food on the other hand was not so enjoyable. I ordered the stuffed tortilla which was not a stuffed tortilla, it was more like a quesadilla thrown together with an odd tasting corn patty. Not a fan. My issue about cheecake's food is just that they can't decide what they want to serve. There is just too much variety which means there is a great selection but the food is just bland. Overall, my recent trip was a bad experience due to the service and the bland food. The Cheesecake factory is a good place to go with a group of people that cant decide what they want to eat but otherwise if you really want great food i wouldn't recommend The Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-scottsdale?start=200,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.8240000000000003,3.1200000000000006
196,Kat R.,"Bellevue, WA",93,113,52.0,4.0,2012-07-18,"This is your typical large-scale chain American food restaurant that wins on customer service and consistency. A bonus is the portion sizes are large enough for two meals and their amazing desserts.  All the pasta dishes are great -- if you love bacon try the Pasta Carbonara. It's my go-to dish here for the moment. My pass favorites include Chicken Bellagio and the chicken alfredo with sun dried tomatoes.  I've had a few sandwiches here -- the club and the cheesesteak. I don't really like the cheesesteak, it just doesn't have that delicious steak and cheese combination flavors like Corleones. However, the club is one of my favorite club sandwiches found anywhere and it's particularly good on a really hot Arizona day with an iced tea or a coke.  The service is always great -- friendly and personable -- and they seem to have the timing down of when to check-up on the table. One of my favorite things about the Cheesecake Factory is their hours: they are open super late for the area, 11:00PM on weekdays and 12:00AM Thursday through Saturday.  One downside is I really don't like their alcoholic drinks. They are really strong (as in not blended right) and taste like they use super cheaper liquor.  Oh and breakfast: not good here. I had the breakfast sandwich made with french toast and bacon. It sounded amazingly delicious but it was so gross I didn't even want to it. Something about cheese and french toast just didn't go together well for me.  This a great place for two people or large groups. Bear in mind the noise level can be a bit loud so come later in the day if you want a quiet meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-scottsdale?start=180,3.12,3.12,3.12,3.056,3.1200000000000006

260,Sonya D.,"San Diego, CA",1610,651,37.0,4.0,2013-01-02,"I went here with my parents on a super crowded Friday evening. We had to wait about 40 min, but decided to order a couple of drinks while we waited. Once we finally got seated, I decided to order the Chicken Madeira, which is their most popular dish. It was sooo good! It was a huge portion, but I somehow managed to finish it. I can see why everyone loves it! My dad ordered the Ahi and had to get them cook it more b/c it was practically raw and cold. It was probably supposed to be like that, but he didn't know what he was getting himself into. They took extra care in getting this done - both our waiter and the manager came over to make sure they were on the same page as my dad before cooking it more thoroughly. They also brought my dad a complimentary house salad while he waited. We decided to end our meals by all splitting a piece of their Peanut Butter Cup cheesecake. OMG. So good.

171,Teehee O.,"Scottsdale, AZ",6,62,7.0,1.0,2013-02-18,"I came here with my family yesterday (group of 5). It was a 15 minute wait which wasn't horrible and then they called us up. We came up to the hostess stand and just stood there waiting for about 5 minutes. I finally asked the hostess why she would call us up if our table wasn't ready. The hostess supervisor overheard me and got involved....apparently what happened was the hostess seated another smaller party at the table set for our group. We watched the hostess go up to the newly seated group which had been seated for about 5 minutes, and KICK THEM OUT of the booth. I felt horrible for the other group. This started the slow and unimpressive meal  :/ Our waiter was just kinda sloppy. He was REALLY SWEATY (like just ran a marathon sweaty and sweat rolling down his face and neck) and unorganized. He had no idea what was on the menu-for example, someone ordered Moroccan Chicken, he asked her if she wanted mashed potatoes with that or a salad but the dish didn't even come with those items, it came with couscous. He made the same mistake with my MIL's entree choice too.  He then tried to push the brunch options but brunch ended at 2pm so it wasn't even available. He didn't even know what time it was. The menu itself was FILLED with advertisements for an assortment of crap, very off putting to me as I just want to pick my meal, not be subjected to page after page of crappy ads.  as It took 20 minutes for him to bring bread, 1 HOUR (yes HOUR) for appetizers, another 45 minutes for entrees. I asked him to bring water for our table for everyone, he brought ONE. When we finally got our entrees, they only came out partially. A member of our group was without his entree for a while and was stuck staring at everyone's food. In the 3 HOURS that it took to get everything we ordered, he refilled our drinks once. I ordered a turkey burger and was not impressed.....it needed more flavor, seasoning and the fries were unappetizing and tasted slightly freezer burnt.  My MIL insisted on dessert so we all got cheesecake (a variety). It took an additional 25 minutes for cheesecake, AS IF it takes 25 minutes to slice a darn cheesecake and plate it?? By the time we had ordered dessert, the place had cleared out for the most part and was NOT busy so there was NO excuse whatsoever for the length of time the service took. By the end of our meal, we could NOT WAIT to leave. My MIL is very shy and gets embarrassed  easily so I didn't raise a fuss with management but this was my first time dining here and it was so unpleasant. I was hugely disappointed  with the entire experience.

That was an awful trip & between that and a sexual harassment lawsuit at the chain around that same time, I honestly wasn't sure I'd ever go back. Well, tonight I did and I'm glad I gave it another shot. Lets get the negative things out of the way first:  The hostess was not very friendly & made me worry that it had been a mistake to go back. The bartender seemed like he was not happy to be there or to talk to us about drinks. It was a little cold in the dining area, but seemed to warm up as the evening progressed. Now for good things: Of course, I got the chicken madeira because I ALWAYS get it and it's ALWAYS delicious. I think the portions are getting a bit smaller these days, but I still had leftovers. Drinks were...meh. I would love if they had a better draught beer selection myself. None of the beers were too exciting so I got a martini and it was...drinkable...maybe. For those prices I'd expect better. Calamari was decent. Cheesecake is always great.  Food was good, but what made tonight's trip overcome the few negatives and past experiences and warrant a 4 star rating was the service. Mandy was great...very friendly and not snooty like some servers in the Scottsdale area can be. She also did not flirt with the guy I was with hoping to get more tips. I hate when servers do that.  There was one mistake by the kitchen where peas were added to a dish that was requested without them, but they realized before it even came out and Greg (who I can assume was the manager on duty) came over to apologize personally and offer a soup or salad while we waited. We appreciated it but declined the offer. Mandy was attentive and was taking good care of us so we really didn't feel like anything was much of a wait. She mentioned that she is fairly new, but had she not told us, we wouldn't have guessed.  Overall a great trip.

More chicken sometimes than the others, but overall good.  My husband changes his mind up often, but gets the Sheila's Chicken Salad the majority of the time. Again, always consistent.  We never come here for dinner because of the price, but do for their tiny-bit-discounted lunch meals. Their strawberry lemonade is delicious, but $5 for a drink that isn't alcoholic?! That seems insane to me..especially because any of their to-go drinks are in the tiniest of cups...a kids size. Their other drinks are in between $3 and $5, so none of the drinks are cheap, which is why I just decide to swallow the cash and spend the $5 on delicious strawberry lemonade. Reason I gave only 3 stars is because the staff is never overly nice, place is clean most of the time, and food is always good.

116,Russell M.,"Cornville, AZ",126,281,46.0,4.0,2014-08-12,"I've eaten at a few CF locations including the original one in Marina del Rey, CA which was the first time I tried them.  I'm always impressed but a bit intimidated by the exhaustive small book sized menu they have.  The good news is the broad selection of cuisine they offer from Cajun, Mexican/southwest/Asian and more.  The bad news is it's a lot to absorb and select from. I've never had a terrible dish at any CF location but some are better than others.  They make a pretty wicked Cajun chicken over pasta which is just the right amount of spicy hot and delicious.  Like most of their entrees, it's large enough to split or share which I recommend you do if you even remotely think you may want to sample one of their famous cheesecakes for dessert. We went here last Friday so the soup of the day was clam chowder which I usually like.  Theirs was tasty but too watery, not creamy as I like it.  We were a party of 6 and I didn't hear anyone else complain so I presume everything was to their liking. I took my own advice and saved room to share a slice of fresh blueberry cheesecake which was good but definitely not outstanding.  My wife is a dessert guru and extraordinary cheesecake is in her repertoire so I am not easily impressed even with what is supposed to be among the best.  It was good but not great. Finally, my biggest complaint about this place is the lighting.  Granted I am approaching 63 and my eyesight is waning but even the (younger) others had trouble reading the micro print on the menu.  I had to use my cell phone to see it which could be somewhat embarrassing for others.  It's just an inconvenience for me.  I've eaten in darker restaurants but they all have strategically placed overhead spotlights to help the vision compromised diner like me. The CF is pretty dependable and I don't see much difference among their locations.  After all, I suppose that is the whole point of a chain eatery - consistency and predictability regardless of which one you patronize.  Their restaurants are all nicely decorated with friendly servers and like I said, seemingly endless selections of food and drink.  A fun place to go for any event or just for a tasty and satisfying meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-scottsdale?start=100,3.12,3.25,3.25,3.152,3.198

I had the Fried Macaroni and Cheese appetizer which was delicious! If you love macaroni and cheese as much I do, this appetizer will not disappoint you. The Fried Macaroni and Cheese is made of 4 macaroni and cheese balls fried on the outside and cheesy on the inside. The macaroni tastes great with the creamy marinara sauce that it is served with and also goes well with the complimentary bread.  Any visit to the Cheesecake Factory demands a slice of any of their specially made cheesecakes for dessert. My favorite has always been their red velvet cheesecake but I decided to try something different an go with the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cheesecake. My tastebuds were not disappointed when it arrived at our table as it had creamy cheesecake, chocolate chips, and warm chewy cookie dough bits baked in the middle.

I had to pull it out of my mouth (in front of my date, on New Years eve)  I let our waiter know and showed him the skin. He just danced around it and barely acknowledged my complaint. He proceeded to take our leftovers and box them up, and brought back our check. I asked him if he could accommodate me at all. He said he would grab his manager KIM. A couple minutes later Kim came to our table and asked me how my steak was. I told her it was delicious and then proceeded to let her know what had happened. She said sorry and that she would let the cooks know, in a super condescending way. She said it was a ""garnish"" and was glad that everything else was ok and told me to have a Happy New Year. I was shocked that she didn't offer me even a desert or to accommodate me in any way. I had to make a little more fuss about it, embarrassing me again in front of my date. She then asked me if I wanted more onions rings. What??? Why would I want more of something that I just had a bad experience with and after I already had my leftovers boxed up. She finally says, I can give you the drinks (which totaled 8.50). Any time I have ever had an incident in a restaurant, I have always been fortunate to have someone actually care about a mistake.

190,Jenn S.,"Phoenix, AZ",3,20,8.0,1.0,2015-03-22,"By far the worst experience I have ever received in a restaurant.  We went to cheesecake factory on a Saturday afternoon around 3:30 for lunch. My friend and her boyfriend arrived before myself and two of my other girlfriends so they were first seated. So after we arrived, they were waiting for 10 minutes for a server. A total of 30 minutes pass by and still no word from a server!!! We just wanted atleast water to start the night off. We alerted a manager by the name of Adam Paige that we haven't been helped for 30 minutes and he showed absolutely no care that we've been waiting. He just said ""ok"". I was a host for two restaurants and I am fully aware how the restaurant business is. Either the host didn't notify the server or the server didn't know the section. Finally our server came to our table saying ""Sorry, I walked past you guys so many times and didn't even know you were my table"". We didn't know how to take that response so we just said it's okay. We finally got our drinks in and then she came back later to take our orders. Some people from my party ordered off the lunch menu, I myself did not. I ordered a Salmon crusted salad. We waiting for 45 minutes for our food to arrive and finally received it. Everyone enjoyed their food and as did I. When we all were full, the server came and asked if we wanted boxes. One of my friends who finished eating before me had her salad boxed by the server but I don't mind boxing my own salad, I thought my server had better things to do than to box my salad. With the salads being huuge, I only touched half of my plate. As I was putting my salad into a box, I KID YOU NOT, TWO FRUIT FLIES WERE AT THE BOTTOM OF MY SALAD. At first I thought, WAIT this cannot be right I must be seeing things. So I closed my togo box and told my friends. As I opened it, I had 4 witnesses seeing flies come out of my salad. so I immediately closed it again. At this point, I was so so disgusted. If two flies were still alive, I cannot imagine how many dead ones I ate. Maybe they were in the lettuce packaging when they made the salad, I do not know. But I sure as hell know what I saw. Me and My friend approached Adam Paige to let him know what was in my salad. I still cannot believe how UNPROFESSIONAL he was. I handed the box of food and said there were fruit flies in my salad. All he said was do you want another one..... ANOTHER ONE!? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? There was no sincere apology, no I am so sorry, he didn't even offer to comp the salad. The SERVER asked me if he will comp it. I just couldn't believe this experience, and it just manages to get worse and worse!!!! All my friends who ordered off the lunch menu were charged full price. Our food was on one receipt, and the manager kept on entering it incorrectly. Finally after the third try a different manager comes to my table to clarify what happened with the receipt. He knew what happened to my salad because he comped it but didn't even apologize for MY experience, just apologized for changing the receipt so many times. I am still in shock at how horrific the experience was. Just wow.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-scottsdale?start=180,3.48,3.35,3.35,2.5000000000000004,3.402

117,George W.,"Scottsdale, AZ",33,66,212.0,2.0,2015-07-12,"This review is strictly about the dessert and not any of the menu items. I see so many 5 stars and I guess if you would want average desserts that load up the sugar and chocolate sauces to mask the flavor then hey this is the 5 star place for you! Had their Godiva cheesecake and since I wanted something with WOW chocolate decided on the chocolate blackout cake.  Now, would one except a dark chocolate almost slightly bitter taste of real cocoa when ordering the Godiva Dark Chocolate?  Or instead how about just giving a really over sweetened chocolate cheese cake with no real homemade texture that may perchance resemble a taste similar to Hershey's ?   Chocolate Blackout Cake- increase the portion size to feed 3 people, decrease the quality of the ingredients and add again the sweet chocolate syrup with an almost artificial chocolate taste upon the cake that is like a box mix.  Voila...charge $9.00 for equivalent of Betty Crocker box cake! Don't mean to go hard on the CF, but most of their menu items on their appetizer side and small plates are fried (one or two healthy ones only), and again from what I see, if you want a ton of food for not a lot of money then sure its great.  I haven't tried their entrees yet, but am a bit hesitate to do so.  Just don't want to set myself up for disappointment. For the service side- seen the same service issues everyone else talks about.  For some reason these corporate chains either hire managers who don't know what they heck they are doing, or decide to offer a pay scale so low that no one takes the job seriously and could care less if they work there or not.  How about pay a few more dollars per hour and hire people who take their job seriously?  And find a real manager, which again might cost a few more dollars but could be worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-scottsdale?start=100,3.16,3.28,3.28,2.3760000000000003,3.2320000000000007

Ordered the chicken samosa appetizer, 4 small greasy wontons filled with chicken.  Doesn't anyone know how to fry anymore?  Why so greasy, pray tell? 380 degrees and they will be virtually greaseless.  These, were NOT.  I didn't complain.  Ordered two red sangrias.  Sangrias came out with lots of ice (less Sangria) and very watery tasting.  I know good Sangria--it's in my genes---but this was NOT it.  Have you noticed that they don't give you the pricing on some of the drinks?  Well, my dear readers, these watery sangrias were $9.50 a piece plus tax and tip.  I will pay $15 for a good drink folks, but I hate being taken for a ride.  But I did not complain.  After all, I was taking a lovely guest out.   Ordered one of my favorites, Fried shrimp in the basket with french fries and cole slaw.  Doesn't seem like such a big deal but when shrimp are freshly fried and delicious nothing beats them.  These, were NOT.  Something very strange with these shrimp.  Firstly, two different colors/tones (see photo).  I tasted the darker, flatter one first. Tasted like frozen shrimp from the supermarket, Carnation brand, or perhaps Sea-Pak?  The lighter, curlier shrimp tasted like it was pre chewed--no really.  It's just an expression but what I meant was that it was mushy inside.  Almost like a shrimp paste --they tasted like the precooked shrimp that come in a ring which were battered and then fried.  Very strange.  Granddaughter's theory was that the darker shrimp were leftover from someone else's plate and re-fried and served to me. Yuk at the thought).  I tried to eat them and ate two and then I said, why are you doing this to yourself?.  When our server, Dylan B, came around I couldn't help but to try to describe what the issue was with these shrimp.  I started with... ""I know you didn't cook this, but.....""   Dylan B listened and apologized.   As we were about to leave a man (manager) came by to ask us how everything was.  I explained the shrimp fiasco.  He gave me an ""explanation"" or how when shrimp are fried and they stick together, one gets darker than the other.  Excuse me Mr. Manager, when was the last time you cooked a dinner?  I am quite a cook so Storytime Theatre didn't work for me.  Then he apologized and left.   Gee, everybody loves to apologize. apologies are cheap.  Is that part of their training?  As long as you apologize,  patrons can eat #######.   I got the bill which amounted to $90.  No accommodation for the horrible meal I had or for the fact that I didn't even have dinner.  No small credit for the lousy shrimp, no slice of cake to make up for it nada, Nyet.   So for $90, I had inedible shrimp, coleslaw overridden with mayonnaise, two watery Sangrias and greasy Samosas.   My husband enjoyed his Chicken Marsala and that's why the ONE star.   Not good, Cheesecake Factory, Not good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-scottsdale?start=60,3.12,3.27,3.27,2.148,3.21

I thought that the food was okay then, but not so much now.  I'm usually a fan of pasta at most restaurants--even at Denny's it's halfway decent.  The spaghetti sauce here had so much garlic in it that it was literally the only thing that I could taste on the pasta.  If I wanted aioli and noodles, I would have asked for it.  The meatballs were pretty good, but were PACKED with onions.  I now reek of garlic and onions and my wife won't get near me.  Thanks guys. Her salad was fairly good, but nothing to write home about.  Nice bread.  Service was friendly.  It was entertaining sitting outside and watching the birds fly in after patrons would leave their tables--they would take bread and raid the sugar packets.

However, today I was extremely disappointed in both the service and my meal. For starters I always order fresh strawberries as an appetizer. The waitress looked at me like I didn't know what I was talking about and gave me a look of confusion. Next when the strawberries were served, they were very old looking.  Just looking at them you could see they were mushy and past their prime. I took two bites and pushed the plate to the end of the table. These strawberries should have never been served!!!  I blame the chef for this one and the server saw no problem with them and challenged me when I brought this to her attention.  My salad came next and lacked some very important ingredients such as apples. I blame the chef for this one too.  When the waitress came back to the table and asked how everything was, I informed her that I was not happy with the strawberries, at which time the waitress got very defensive and told me that I didn't order them the correct way and she didn't seem at all concerned.  I also had a take out order I had placed at the beginning of my meal so she could have it ready for when I was done with my meal. When she brought the bill I asked for my to-go-meal and she said she completely forgot! I then, had to sit there for an extra 15 minutes and wait for her to bring me this meal.  I am not one to write bad reviews but I couldn't believe this service and quality of food (strawberries).

We were sat immediately and our server was Victoria T. She was great. Attentive, on point, pleasant and not intrusive. Kudos. So the birthday boy C got the Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake ($7.95). He loved it. Personally, I didn't think it had enough cream cheese flavor and was too sweet but that's just me. They wrote Happy Birthday in chocolate on his plate so he felt special. K had the Lemon Meringue Cheese Cake ($7.95). She loved it. I didn't taste it but she said it had very nice lemony flavor and had really good texture. Grandma C had the Tiramisu Cheese Cake ($7.95). Her only comment was Yum. I had Carrot Cake ($7.95). OK, enough of the laughing. I'm not the biggest fan of commercial Cheesecake because it never has enough cream cheese in it. And since there was going to be 3 Cheesecakes on the table, why add a fourth. Plus, I love good Carrot Cake. For the most part, The Cheesecake Factory does a good job with all their desserts so I never feel like it's going to be a bad decision not to go with a Cheesecake. My Carrot cake was very good. A tad on the dry side but that's probably because once the cake is sliced, one side of the next piece is going to begin to dry out. The cake still has good flavor, was moist enough and there were noticeable pieces of Carrots within the cake. The frosting is also pretty good although for me it's a little too sweet and could use a little more cream cheese flavor. All in all, very good though.

Once we were seated, the waiter took maybe 10 minutes to get us water, which wasn't a big deal considering it was relatively busy. Once it came time to order, I ordered what I usually love getting which is the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich.. When it came to our table, I took one bite and noticed that it wasn't quite right. The bun was toasted way too much, to the point where it was like biting into a burnt cracker. Also, there was maybe a pinch of buffalo sauce. Maybe. But I couldn't see it or taste it. So, naturally, I ask the waitress if they could take it back and make it again. She apologized and said she would be happy to have the cooks do that for me. What happens next was down right disgusting. She put my plate on top of someone else's dirty plate with half eaten rice and tomatoes on it, and brought my food back to the kitchen to be made again.. Or so I thought. They ended up just throwing another bun on it and sent my bitten-into sandwich back to me. One thing I learned from working in a restaurant, you never bring someone's food from the table, to the kitchen and back to the table again... You should always  prepare a new dish. After that I received no discount, no coupon, nothing but an apology for the burnt bun.

My first time was so so... I believe in second chances do I went ahead and brought my GF and a friend over tonight (7-28-16) at around 10pm.  We walked in and within a minute the host, she was very friendly. We got sat and waited about 10 minutes to get greeted. There were a tons of servers sitting everywhere chit chatting and walking pass us without acknowledging us. I flagged down a server because I had some questions regarding the menu. She was nice but disappeared really fast. Guessing she wasn't our server!!  Our server finally came over and said hi... Honestly she had ZERO energy! Wasn't really attentive, friendly nor recommended any drinks, apps or main courses! She was a order taker and not a waitress!  So we ordered our drinks and then our meals. We ordered the orange chicken, mac n cheese balls and the filet mignon tips which I had maybe 30 times in my lifetime visiting Cheesecake Factory.  Mac was alright, orange chicken was extremely hard to bite into it (overcooked) . That's was my gf meal and she was embarrassed to complain so instead she paid for it and box it up to later throw it in the garbage. I ordered the meat medium and it came out completely raw, literally blood everywhere. The wine sauce was off... Tasted bad... Really bad. Server never came and checked if we were enjoying the meals so I had once again to flag her down. I explained my concern and she offered to take my meal and cook it a bit more. I declined her suggestion and honestly I was a bit offended. After telling her that the sauce tasted bad and the meat wasn't cooked properly, I was expecting a sincere apologies, offered a new meal and not the same one, and lastly the MANAGER never came over to check on us!!! I just felt like you guys didn't care. The server came back after 2 minutes to tell us that indeed the chef wanted to apologize because he forgot one ingredient!?! Really!?! That all I get!? My night is ruined, wasted one hour out of my life and this is the kind of solution you have!?  I worked 12 hours and I was just leaving work and looking forward to eat at my favorite restaurant. Hmm not sure if it still is but I guess I will come back here and there just to buy cheesecake. And ended not eating anything.

20,Russell Z.,"Fullerton, CA",1156,362,323.0,4.0,2017-02-02,"The Cheesecake Factory. With an extensive menu, what's there not to love? I went there on a  Monday, 01/30/2017, in the early evening. I started off the evening with a bourbon and honey drink which came out in a martini glass; apart from the style of the glass, I was a fan of the drink itself. For the entree, I had the chicken marsala and mushroom dish served over a bed of farfalle pasta. The flavors were all there, the smoothness of the butter and reduced alcohol with the broth all came together nicely. However, I was not a fan of the chicken texture itself. It seemed too... Soft. Almost as if the chicken wasn't entirely fresh, but not like it was spoiled or anything. Almost like the meat was cured or pounded or something, so it was softer in texture than would naturally occur. Maybe this is something that others enjoy, but I'm sort of not for it. One of the things that has always struck odd in my mind is how extensive the menu is. When a menu is as many pages as it is at Cheesecake Factory, and offers so much in variety, it makes you wonder how fresh the ingredients actually are. Is it all frozen? If so, does it justify the high price point? These are questions that Yelpers should ask themselves when they go places. Fundamentally, are you REALLY getting your money's worth? All in all, I had a good experience here. I may return, but the last time I set foot in a Cheesecake Factory before this was well before 2012.

16,Letha D.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,6,9.0,1.0,2017-09-22,"The cheesecake recipe has changed. The service was surly and slow. My sever barely spoke to me. I felt sad. The cake is foamy and not creamy anymore. A sad disappointment all around. The music outside was good. It was R&B. It's so nice of the corporate arm to respond to me. I still recall how the server served me under my arm behind me, as if to hide his face. He didn't check on me after that underhanded serve. I still feel sad about that decision to go there and try to have fun.  When the surly waiter discovered that all I wanted was a piece of cheesecake, he became pushy and then, dismissive.  You're known for cheesecake. You even made up your own recipe for cheesecake, if my mouth is a good food sleuth. I used to go to a cafe at the Ritz Carleton on North Michigan Avenue in Chicago and just have dessert. Plenty of people go to a place for a dessert course. Your waiter was too poorly trained to be aware of that. He insulted me.   Thank you to The Cheesecake Factory for the nice apology.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-scottsdale,3.32,3.26,3.236,,3.2840000000000003

The server assigned to the section next to us ended up asking if we had been greeted yet and ended up getting our drinks for us. Our server still took another 2-3 minutes before making it to our table. She asked us if she could get us any water, I said yes and asked for no ice please. She acknowledged my request and said absolutely. My water came back with ice (not a big deal at all) but that is the ultimate server test to see if you're server is actually paying attention. I manage a very high paced restaurant myself and that would never fly with my servers. Not to mention it's not even busy in here.

Hubby and I shared the antioxidant salad and the half portion was perfect for me for lunch. Hubby and son shared the sliders (4 sliders per order) and the potstickers. That was just enough to satisfy them enough in order to share a piece of white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake. Everyone was happy with our food and drinks. The restaurant was not crowded as we arrived around 1:30 on a Wednesday. The restaurant and washrooms were clean and the server was friendly and attentive. We can always count on the Cheesecake Factory for a satisfying meal and I like that they offer healthy options. For gf, vegan dessert you can order a bowl of strawberries.

2,Lauren D.,"Paradise Valley Village, Phoenix, AZ",1,84,12.0,4.0,2017-11-29,"Cheesecake has a pretty extensive menu which is what keeps it in my rotation of go-to chains. There is something for everyone on the menu, so it's great for larger groups. Mexican, Asian, American and Italian inspired dishes cover the pages.  I'm not one to watch my diet but they do have gluten free options and a ""skinnylicious"" menu that are not limited to one or two items. You get selection there too.  I've always had solid service here. When it's busy things may be a tad slower but they deliver and are attentive.  While I've had good salads, burgers and appetizers here, this time I opted for the shrimp scampi and steak Diane. Wow! Definitely my new favorite. You get to taste both of these entrees and a pile of mashed potatoes separates them. YUM! The cheesecakes are all pretty amazing. For a chocolate/PB fan, Adam's Peanut Butter Pie is the go to move. I deviated and got the Hershey's chocolate bar cheesecake this visit and while it was good, I'll definitely go back to Adam's next time.

Nowadays, I choose to eat healthier and this place doesn't fit my needs anymore.

12,A Z.,"Scottsdale, AZ",1,14,,1.0,2017-12-10,"We've been to the Cheesecake Factory a few times since living in Scottsdale and sadly will not be returning. Tonight we decided to eat here for my daughter's birthday and we all left extremely disappointed.  Our waitress started off not wanting to be at work and very short with her words. She then reminded us several times that she has been working all day and very tired.  For drinks, my husband and I ordered coffees only to have my husband's coffee come to the table full of grounds, not a little bit of grounds, but a lot! We asked for a different cup and simply never got one.  When my husband's starter salad came out he ate half of it only to find a very large dark hair in it. He stopped eating it and we told the waitress. The manager then came out and apologized and offered another salad. Which we turned down.  When our daughter's kids meal (spaghetti) came out it had a large black ""thing"" in it, which we noticed right away. So the waitress took the plate away and simply never came back with our daughter's food.  After an hour at the table, our daughters ended up eating my husband's food since the spaghetti plate was never returned.  The waitress apologized for all the troubles and said ""they"" would make it right. We were unsure what that meant so we didn't specifically ask how.  When we got the bill, ""they"" took off our daughter's spaghetti kids meal (but JUST the spaghetti as we still had to pay for her kids drink) and mind-you she never even got her meal back to actually eat. My husband left hungry and thirsty and the whole family upset about the experience.  We honestly are the type of people who would come back as mistakes do happened. But this time we felt no one really cared about all the mistakes. Especially our waitress, who acting like she was just simply ""too tired"".

I've been to a number of locations around the country and they're usually good and finally decided to try this one in our back yard during a weekday to celebrate my birthday.  The service was very slow, despite being fairly empty.  The server couldn't care less that it was my birthday.  Didn't bring a cheesecake menu when asked and didn't bring a candle or anything.   We could hear and see other birthday celebrations at other tables.  This server just didn't seem to like us as she chatted up other tables with her life story while ignoring us sing 'Happy Birthday.'  We even asked afterwards about getting anything complimentary or a candle and got a nonsense answer about only with other desserts.  If not for a birthday, we wouldn't be there and certainly wouldn't order dessert.    It was really a let-down. I called the manager later, who was equally uninterested in making anything right.  She said she'd talk to the server about their policy and hoped we'd come in for future birthdays.   Absolutely NOT!

I have faith my food will be just as good. I tend to dine off the Skinnylicous menu. Many options that taste great but only have less calories. Especially since that warm bread tends to make up for what I cut out. The last time I dined there was a few days ago with my friends daughter. I ordered the Asian Tacos off the Skinnylious menu.
