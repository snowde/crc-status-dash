329,Shandiin G.,"Renton, WA",181,56,44.0,3.0,2012-01-13,Ohhhhh Cheesecake Factory!!!! So This particular location is the downtown Seattle one! For me its a love/hate relationship. Love as in I love cheesecakes and hate as in every time I go to this place there is a long LONG wait! I happened to go there one a Tuesday evening and again I had to wait about 20 minuets to get my table by the door and it was quite the chilly evening!! The service I got there this evening was sorta 50/50. Some people were friendly and some were just wishy washy and I didn't like that. My biggest beef with this Cheesecake Factory is that the floors are always slippery. I thought it was the shoes I ware but its a different pair of shoes every time???? what the hay? One of these days I'm gonna hit the deck on my quest for some cheesecake!  Now as for the food. I love the food. I order the same things every time I'm there (I'm boring like that sometimes) this time me and my friend said that we were going to go outside the box and order something different. It was pretty good. I had the chicken and sundried tomatoes. I will have to say that the quality of food is always pretty good. Don't get me started with the cheesecake... particularly the Red Velvet! Oh my lab that this is so good and so worth the money! So basically I dig Cheesecake Factory. there are just a few things about it that I wish would change. I'm just glad the food is good!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-seattle?start=420,3.4,3.3,3.3,3.2120000000000006,3.3400000000000003
310,Helen N.,"Seattle, WA",1,18,,3.0,2012-01-14,"I went with a few friends on a Saturday afternoon and they were decently packed and well staffed. We didn't make any reservations and we only had to wait a little while for a booth. The service was pretty good, appropriately timed the a waitress came for drink orders and then for our food order. Although there was one awkward moment when Parmesan was shredded into my water. The food was nothing to brag about. I had a medium factory burger and it took me a few second to realize it was mine when it came to the table. It was pretty red and medium rare at best (perfect after two minutes of microwave at home) and my friends noticed it too. Eat the fries were like McDonald fries; eat it hot and now. I shared a slice of the tiramisu cheesecake, that at least was good. Overal, I can't complain, there was cheesecake involved.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-seattle?start=440,3.4,3.29,3.29,3.2760000000000007,3.334

Their pastas are delicious (as they should be--do you know how much calories one pasta entree packs??). And their cheesecakes are oh-so-heavenly. I've had the bistro shrimp pasta here--perfection. I've also had the tiramisu and Oreo cheesecakes. I'm not a big fan of Oreos in general, but the tiramisu was absolutely heavenly cheesecake goodness.

Last time I was there, though, I never got my bread. I don't know why. The table next to mine got their's. I love their wheat bread, so I was a little annoyed by that.

363,Charlotte S.,"Seattle, WA",104,7,,2.0,2012-03-17,Normally I don't have an issue at cheesecakes factory however today my mother and I waited a longer then average amount of time for our drinks. Our food was also late out due to being taken to the wrong table. There was a shift change in the middle of our meal at which time we discovered that our original waitor hadn't notified our new waitress of a to-go order we had placed so it never got started. When she retook the order she told is we couldn't have onion rings which the original waiter neglected to tell us and when I finally got home across town and my boyfriend open his container we discovered someone else's order.

For desert I had the red velvet cheesecake - SO GOOD!  I just finished eating it actually lol.  I would highly recommend.  My husband had the reeces peanut butter cheesecake - he loved it as well.

I usually say when a menu is too long it shows that the restaurant is a jack of all traits and masters of none. This is kind of the case with Cheesecake Factory but because it's a chain store, everything is always a decent quality. Why is it a 4-star? The staff is great even when the restaurant is packed (and it often is since it's so close to the convention center). There is a GREAT happy hour menu and the drinks are strong. (Also, these days it seems like pina coladas are hard to find so this is my go-to guilty pleasure spot.) Note: lunch portions are the way to go - it's still a huge portion and you will be full!

It was quite crowded (both with what I assume is the ""normal"" Friday evening crowd, and congoers) but we managed to snag a table at the bar right away.  The menu is huge. Exhaustingly huge, when you're indecisive like I am. I eventually ordered the Chicken Bellagio because someone at the next table over had it and it looked amazing. And it was really good. Drinks were good too. I enjoyed the experience. We actually tried to come back the next night too, but the wait was incredibly long for the restaurant section, and we waited for a bar table to open up for a while but people would always rush in and ninja the tables, so we gave up. I really want to try the Macaroni and Cheese Burger, I have to admit... I love burgers, and I love mac and cheese, so why not put it ON a burger? It could be good or really gross, but I want to try it... Even though we didn't get dinner here that night, I did come back later in the evening for a piece of cheesecake... I was actually kind of disappointed by the cheesecake itself. I had a chocolate raspberry piece, and while it was good, it wasn't amazing. I thought the texture was weird.

My friend and I came here after dropping my little sister off at SEATAC and before we had our epic drive back to Vancouver. It was already 9:30pm and we had never really been around downtown seattle so we weren't sure where to eat. Many places were already closed as well. I had been to Cheesecake Factory years ago and remembered liking it, and so we came again.  It's also open til 11pm which was a perk. First thing. Service was pretty good, our waiter was very nice, humorous, and on top of everything. I like the old school decor and lighting, although it was largely a family atmosphere it could easily be turned into a romantic atmosphere. For example, newly dating couple sitting right next to us, romantic, cute, he shakes the ketchup, the cap flies off and hits our tables, he's hugely embarrassed and red as we laugh. The girl is laughing but reassuring. Come on, that's pretty cute, romantic, first date material. Second thing, the menu is HUGE. It took us a while to finally decide on what we wanted to eat as we were reading the novella. I like that there's a large selection of food to eat, but at the same time it was overwhelming. Third thing, YES! Dessert menu, also large, but we knew that if we ate anything, we were definitely getting some cheesecake.   As tiramisu is my favourite cake, I got the tiramisu cheesecake, my friend got the pineapple cheesecake.

Lucky we did because it was a 30-minute wait when we went in at only 5:15! Not really surprising so we were prepared for that. Our waiter was fantastic, especially since it was pretty busy there. Very friendly, and apparently he had tried to go to the very convention we were at but was stuck working, so he was a kindred spirit of sorts, ha. Very knowledgeable about the menu and even warned me one of the drinks I ordered ran SUPER sweet. I appreciated that since that could have been disastrous if I didn't like sweet things! The food itself this time around was good. The portions were just right for me coming in there very hungry, and both my husband and I left super full from delicious menu choices!

The sweet brown bread and the butter make a good start! I always have to resist myself from eating too much of it. 2. MISO SALMON OVER RICE. The salmon's texture is perfect, but I'm more impressed with the sauce. Can I just say for the record that the sauce is soooo heavenly-creamy-groovy? I can't find a perfect adjective to describe the taste, so my attempt to hyphenate these words ain't enough to justify my experience. Y'all need to go and taste it for yourself. And of course, being Asian, the fact that the miso salmon comes with RICE completes it all! 3. CAJUN JAMBALAYA PASTA. This is an interesting marriage between Italian and Southern flavors. The peppery spicy cajun sauce is very distinctive and rich. I usually can't take a lot of spicy food, but the spiciness level is balanced.

538,Hong N.,"Pierce, WA",2,34,39.0,4.0,2012-10-07,"I must admit that I love the Cheesecake Factory's food, but unfortunately my waistline doesn't. Thankfully, we do not live too close to one so our visits occur during our visits to Seattle. When it comes to eating out, I am very much a creature of habit. If i like a particular dish, that is what I will order every time I go there. I am very reluctant with changing up my entree choices. However, at Cheesecake Factory, I have several go to dishes! For appetizers, we usually do the Thai lettuce wrap or the Tex-Mex Eggrolls. The Thai lettuce wrap is sooooo good as well as quite healthy. The chicken is grilled and everything else is fresh (bean sprout, carrots, cucumber, lettuce, and rice noodles). You get to put together your own wrap and then choose to dip it in one of three sauces included: Peanut, Sweet Red Chili and Tamarind-Cashew. All three sauces have their own unique, yet tasty flavor so I usually dip one wrap in each sauce. The Tex-Mex eggrolls on the other hand, is not so healthy, but still super good. They do have a kick to it, but not what I would consider spicy. As far as entrees, I love the Steak Diane! It comes with mash potatoes, but we usually add a side of veggies to it. The steak strips are always cooked to our liking and very tender. The mushroom wine sauce is rich, but not overwhelming. I have also had the Grilled Salmon which was nice and flaky and well seasoned.  I must admit I am not a big dessert person, but when I do get dessert, the Fresh Strawberry Shortcake is my best friend!  I have also tried their Carrot Cake, but found the icing to be too sweet for my liking, although the cake itself was quite good. My husband is a huge cheesecake fan and every cheesecake he has tried, he has loved! Pricing is fair, particularly since you get quite the allotment of food for what you pay for, not to mention, VERY GOOD food! My husband and I tend to share an appetizer and entree when we go. The wait staff has always been very attentive, but the only downfall is they don't take reservations which is inconvenient when you try to go with a group or trying to reserve for a special occasion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-seattle?start=360,3.8,3.56,3.56,3.536,3.656

It was very tender, lightly spiced and very juicy. As a side, she had the mashed potatoes, which had a good layered taste. Also, the rockin' rocky road shake tasted good and the liquor was strong. One and she was done.  My other friend had the salmon with Diana steak. The potatoes were tender and fluffy and presented a lot of flavor. The sauce was a little bit strong on the steak, but overall the steak was good and tender. The salmon on the other hand was a little dry and had too much cream sauce. Less tasty than expected.  The buffalo blasts, when they arrived on the table were not at all what we were expecting. They looked like a piece of fried chicken, but on first bite, we realized they were a sort of buffalo chicken pastry. As for the flavor, it was excellent. It was like Emeril's ""bam""! It took buffalo chicken to a new level. Get some for appetizers and then get some to go.  I ordered the Mac and cheese burger. I can't say the burger was great nor bad for when I bit into the burger, it left me in a state of confusion. The favors didn't pop, but blended together. All of us had different opinions on trying it, so this may be something you need to judge for yourself. The fries were awesome.

Indeed.  Are the portions so big as to be absurd? Definitely.  But, if you are willing to accept The Cheesecake Factory for what it is, you can have a nice meal here. I came with a friend for lunch, as their lunch menu prices are pretty reasonable, especially for downtown.  The menu is ridiculously large.  I usually only read a page or two of it and make my choice from there, or I'd spend the entire lunch hour just flipping back and forth.  I chose a flatbread pizza which was all right (although not well-cut so I ended up having to try to saw it apart with a table knife) and a 'cup' of clam chowder that would be considered a pot's worth anywhere else.  The soup was tasty, as were my friend's crabcake bites.  She also ordered a beet and goat cheese salad which was good.  We got the usual complimentary bread basket which is nice for fending off starvation pains while you wait, although the wait was not long.  Service was on top of things, although the restaurant is so big that they 'lost' my friend who had arrived before me and it took a few minutes before we figured out which table she was at. Despite its large size, the place gets full quickly, especially around dinner and I don't think they take reservations, or at least they only take them by phone, day of.  However, it wasn't busy when we were there and the noise level was perfectly manageable.  I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here or wait more than a few minutes for a table, but for a reliable, tasty, not overly expensive meal, it will always make my list.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-seattle?start=420,3.8,3.61,3.204,3.408,3.686

I was given a pager like always before.  We stood outside because there was no room inside to stand, at one point my niece had to take the baby inside because it was getting extremely cold outside. At about 35-40 minutes, I walked in and asked where we were in the process and I was told that the pager had gone off and my name had been called.  First of all not everyone can fit who is waiting in the restaurant, that is simple not possible.  Second, there was a significant amount of people outside waiting. Third, at not one time did the pager ever flash so right off the bat we have an issue with a defunct pager and a process of getting people fairly in to a table not working.  When I complained I was told that someone phone called me.  That would have entailed someone asking for my phone number from the get go and that did not happen.  Nor did anyone walk outside to ask people or call out any names.   What makes me mad?  Defunct pager?  Or one of your staff outright lying or having to stand outside with a three month old baby.   Here is my suggestion: 1. Have a process if you do not have a customer come up within 1 minute of having their pager go off, call out their name inside and outside. 2. Take a cell phone number if the above fails. 3.

To start with dessert, the cheesecake is delicious. There is a huge selection of varying sizes and sweetness, and I almost always go for the tuxedo cheesecake. A little pricy, but worth it. Solid 4 stars I'd say. Next, the food is pretty much average. There is an overwhelming number of choices, though I usually get some form of pasta. Every dish I've ordered there (plus the bites stolen from friend's plates) have all been tasty, but not mind blowingly so. Honestly, it's just what you would expect from a chain restaurant that specializes in dessert. Pricy, and not entirely worth it. 3 stars. The service is generally polite, yet slow. Considering how busy they get, I can't really blame them (expect at least 30 minute waits, depending on when you go). The atmosphere and decor is rather tacky for my taste (I refuse to make and ""cheesy"" puns), even for downtown. Again, 3 stars. So where does the 1 star rating come from? I've got 2 words for you:  Food poisoning. Long story short, it was my boyfriend's first time here, so I told him to arrive hungry so he would have room for dessert. I know he didn't eat much during the day besides some snack food at his house, and he felt fine when he met my friend and I at the restaurant. When we got our menus, he then preceded to make fun of the ""Pasta with Meat Sauce."" Just what kind of pasta was it? More importantly, what kind of mystery meat? There was no description. He ordered it simply to tempt fate, and sure enough it was simply spaghetti with ground beef in marinara sauce. He claimed it was tasty, but got full about half way through. That was a first for him. Then we ordered cheesecake because, well, cheesecake. By the time we left, he started to mention the stomachaches, and at least he managed to make it home before the mystery meat sauce decided to make its way back up again.

563,Hannah H.,"Vancouver, Canada",659,216,1239.0,4.0,2014-06-12,"When my boyfriend first told me that he wanted to have dinner here my response was ""I don't want to eat dessert for dinner! who eats cheesecake for dinner!?!?!"" Clearly my life was not complete before the discovery of cheesecake factory lol. I Love this place - totally worth the two hour drive from Vancouver for us! I've also been to the one in Bellevue, a few in Portland, and the one in Caesars at Las Vegas. I definitely have to commend this chain for consistency - it doesn't matter which location I am in I can always expect the same deliciousnesssss. Here is my list of favourites: 1. Beets with Goat Cheese Salad - this is a small little long plate green apple, beets, arugula, pecans 2. Ahi Tartare - tiny serving but presentation is on point! 3. Stuffed Mushrooms - these little guys are amazing! It's like a medley of cheese baked inside the mushrooms in an herbs and wine sauce 4. Crispy Crab Wontons - these are so delish, i think it's imitation crab inside these deep fried wontons, the sauce is like a vinegar/fish sauce 5. Thai Lettuce Wraps - these are classified under appetizers but it's actually a full meal for me. It can be kind of messy so if you don't want to get your hands dirty and do some work then probably not a good choice for you. The chicken is soo good it's marinated in sauce and sprinkled peanuts on top - this dish comes with cucumbers, cabbage, diced carrots, bean sprouts and some noodles. There are three dipping sauces to choose from which is awesome if you're a diverse sauce person haha 6. Fish and Chips - the fish is never dark brown which I love because it tells me how old the oil is that they're deep frying in. Generous servings for sure - a little on the salty side but no regrets  7. Chicken Marsala - love this one, chicken is tender, a little heavy on the sauce for me but overall super tasty. 8. Bang Bang chicken and shrimp - love this asian dish, again a little on the salty side but lots of flavour 9. White Chicken Chili - good for cooler days - not too much rice which my boyfriend appreciates (he hates rice). We tried the Vietnamese Summer Rolls once  - omg TERRIBLE. I might be biased because I grew up eating home made vietnamese salad rolls but these are gross - I don't know if it's because it has mushrooms in it or if it's just the combination of stuff inside..... Now for my favourite cheesecakes: 1. 30 year anniversary cake  - if you like tuxedo, or chocolate, or just plain heaven in your mouth this is the one!!!!! 2. Oreo Dream Extreme - it's got real oreos in it.....embedded in the cheesecake.... enough said! 3. Craig's Crazy Carrot - I'm a carrot cake enthusiast so this one really hits the spot for me, it also doesn't contain raisins/cranberries which is a plus for me I feel like these just ruin the carrot cake haha 4. White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle - this one is definitely on the sweeter side for me (obviously they're all super rich and sweet) but I think it's the white chocolate that makes this one even sweeter. Still delicious but I'm more of a chocolate person than fruit. Also love the dinner rolls they bring out before your meal - I always have to remind myself not to get full off of these. There's the regular white bread and then there's this magical ""chocolate"" bread.  Would recommend everyone trying this if you're in DT Seattle - you will be hooked! Just don't read the nutritional information otherwise you won't be able to eat anything here hahah",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-seattle?start=160,3.52,3.56,3.408,3.3440000000000003,3.5440000000000005

The bee/friend and I usually stop in here, before a concert @ the paramount. We grab a few appetizers and drinks. I really like their strawberry martini. It's sweet, but not too sweet and strong but not too strong. A perfect balance between the two :)  Plus, what's not to like here?? They have a HUGE menu!! I'm sure everyone, can find at least one thing, they will like here. The have small bites, then appetizers, salads, burgers, steaks, pastas, seafood and dessert and moooore I'm sure. We usually stick to small bites and appetizers b/c those are usually plenty, if you get two or three.  Today we were in Bellevue, looking to watch the end of the USA vs Belgium game. So we parked at Bell-Square and there was Cheesecake so we walked right in and took a seat at the bar. We were greeted right away and got our drinks started. Usually, food takes a minute (on our part) but we were pretty hungry so we ordered the boston salad and miso salmon. We have ordered both these items in the past, and have been pleased. Today the salad was a little light on the dressing, so it either needed more dressing or salt BUT the lettuce is soooo good!! So fresh and so green! I love that in a salad. BUUUUUT the best part, was definitely the miso salmon. It just melts in your mouth and the sauce, compliments it just perfectly. I would definitely recommend ordering this! Soooo why do people not like this place? I don't know, it is a chain, servers are just servers, with not much personality and the food is just basic. BUT hey, they get the job done, in a good way! I've never had bad service here, the food is good! I don't have HIGH expectations but for the most part, I always leave satisfied here annnd don't even get me started on that cheesecake. I am not one to order dessert but 9 out of 10 times, I will order strawberry cheesecake here and it is just amazing. Today was that one time, that I didn't but normally I would.

In my opinion, the food is overpriced, incredibly unhealthy for you, generic, and simply not THAT great. The cheesecake is all incredibly rich and sweet, I couldn't even finish one slice that I split with my boyfriend. What I really don't get about this place is that it's pretending to be some upscale, fancy restaurant. Faux-fancy decor, high prices, tourist-central location, but there's ads in the menu, you get butter in little wrapped packages with your bread, and the food is just slightly above average. If I'm paying $16-$20 for an entree, I shouldn't have to unwrap my damn butter. Come on. The thing is, there are tons of great restaurants near the Seattle CF location. For the same price range, you can get much better food that represents PNW fare, and support a local business. Why oh why would you go here to feel sick and bloated afterwards AND be out $30+ for a standard drink, entree, dessert combo?

Bad planning on our part because of huge Pax gaming convention this weekend as our dinner outing was at the same timing when a mass exodus of gaming people filtered out to all the nearby restaurants resulting in many places like CCF to be at capacity. We waited for about 40mins+. Definitely plan ahead to find out if any major events are occuring!!! Worth the extra effort if travelling with baby and toddlers cause you never know when their tolerance will snap before parents go into salvage mode for the remaining evening.  Note sure if all locations are setup the same as marble floor felt greasy to walk on, even though my wife an I with baby in tote wore rubber soled shoes,u almost slipped walking towards back of restaurant. Not a reassuring thought considering the added responsibility of a baby in hand!!! Shortly being seated, patrons that walked by mumble the same thought to only confirm our uneasy feeling. Definitely a safety concern for EVERYONE working there and eating there.  Waiter was attentive with him taking our order within minutes however, missed the standard bread basket they promptly give you while waiting for the main dishes arrive. I always look forward to this so, was disappointed they neglected this part. Could haveme asked it although, by the time we noticed several other tables receiving the status quo treatment our food arrived.  Literally, the dishes are severed on big dishes to make you feel like you're getting a big portion. Can you imagine if it was four adults with a 2-course meal each and drinks and water plus CCF's standard tableware arrangement... Chaos for space!!! JMHO though. As for the food... was not bad as we ordered Bang - Bang Chicken and Shrimp & Chicken Lettuce Wrap tacos. Even my baby daughter liked her Farfalle bowtie pasta in Alfredo sauce; portion was big for cost to what she ate before I attempted to eat some to avoid wasting food. Such a shame to see restaurants to this day overdue their portions especially for baby/toddlers that can be finicky with food or just testing out new foods groups. Either way,  it was messy watching her eat it yet, a bonus in my view that she ate it all and that CCF had such to offer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-seattle?start=280,3.76,3.53,3.5,3.2440000000000007,3.622

I mean overall I know that people travel all around to eat here but it has honest gone down. We waited 1 hour, understandable since it's the weekend. Upon being seated down the server greeted us right away. We were ready to order as soon as we were seated since we were hungry. Already a bit upset with the wait, it got a lot worst. The bread took about 20 minutes to get to our table, as it is ""cooking"" stated the server. We ordered a steak and chicken combo and pasta. They were both extremely salty and tasted really bad. The pasta was dry, and over salted. The steak was not even cooked properly, and every bite seemed like it had more salt than the last. We thought by adding some gravy to it, it'll make things better but it make it worst. We told the server the situation but instead of acting upon it all he knew how to say was ""sorry"". He did not offer the items to be remade or anything. Feeling upset at that point, we got up, paid the bill and left.  Now being that a few hours have passed since our horrible, salty meal.. I'm feeling gross and sick. I don't think he brought this up to the attention of management. Such a big chain should be able to cook proper food and provide better customer service.

Twenty minutes later, we were informed that the order did not go through because they were out of chicken. The only option left for me was gluten free pasta.

500,Kelsey L.,"Kenmore, WA",16,3,1.0,3.0,2014-12-03,"Ahhhh the Cheesecake Factory in downtown Seattle is the most breathtaking restaurant I have ever eaten at! The beautiful chandeliers and gorgeous paintings give me the urge to go to Greece or somewhere European-like.  Although, since this is a downtown restaurant, often times this setting can be very intense/packed by events and tourists which means you have to wait standing up to be seated, and sometimes you may have to wait up to an hour depending on how busy they are and what day you choose to go on. When I came here for dinner I came at a very hectic time since there was an event just ending across the street at the Washington State Convention Center. The wait took about 45 minutes, and we had to stand and wait since all the seats were taken. There were a lot of pushy and impatient people that night since so many people were also waiting to be seated so that they could eat. The service from our waiter was absolutely awesome! He was very enthusiastic and put a positive spin on our very hectic surrounding.  For the food, I ordered the Miso Salmon for$19.95, which is an average price when eating at the Cheesecake Factory. My order comes with fresh marinated miso salmon served with snow peas, white rice and a delicious sweet miso sauce. The salmon was super delicate and tender, it melted right in my mouth! The miso sauce gave the salmon a sweet soft hint to it and the snow peas and white rice were a great combination with the taste of this particular salmon. I would have to say I indulged myself with the flavors of the salmon and Id go back anytime and order the same thing.  I overall give this particular Cheesecake Factory a 3 out of 5 because their service definitely adds some classiness to this busy restaurant yet their wait time and hectic surrounding was a little too much for me and is not the place I would go if I wanted to relax and enjoy my meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-seattle?start=180,3.68,3.54,3.544,3.2760000000000007,3.5960000000000005
100,Mojdeh S.,"Seattle, WA",301,735,898.0,3.0,2014-12-08,"How I heard of this place: The first time I learned of the Cheesecake Factory was from my sister, Mojgan, years ago. It became my go-to spot in Seattle when the Cheesecake Factory first opened downtown, because of the plethora of options and variety of foods available for large parties with differing tastes. Type of cuisine: A typical chain establishment, with a variety of options including pizzas, salads, burgers, and pastas in flavors inspired by Mexico, Italy, North America, etc. Ambiance: Usually a large establishment, with high ceilings, this downtown Seattle restaurant is no different. Booths and chair-table seating (in the bar as well) can be found in dark wood with glass ornamentation throughout the venue. Music plays in the background, sometimes loudly, as the hustle and bustle of restaurant spaces can be heard and felt. Patrons are not shy to speak to their dining companions aloud, but rarely do conversation topics make it to the neighboring tables. What I ordered: On this trip, four of us dined at the restaurant and shared three dishes, in addition to the free bread and butter served to us upon seating. The two, large appetizers we selected were the hot spinach and cheese dip, made with spinach, artichoke hearts, shallots, garlic and a mixture of cheeses, served bubbly hot with tortilla chips and salsa. The Factory nachos, crisp tortilla chips covered with melted cheeses, guacamole, sour cream and salsa with spicy chicken. For something a little healthier, yet large enough to serve four, we enjoyed the barbeque ranch chicken salad served with avocado, tomato, grilled corn, black beans, cucumber and romaine all tossed with barbeque ranch dressing and topped with crispy fried onion strings for crunch. What I loved: I loved the sourdough bread, the hot, very cheesy spinach dip and the flavorful salad. The crispy onion strings added texture and taste, as they were prepared with thin red onion slices. Why I loved it: The portions are huge and the food consistently good. You know what you are going to get at the Cheesecake Factory, where everything tastes the same from Seattle, to Las Vegas, from Orange County to Bellevue. Cost: Average to high ($9-$20 per entree)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-seattle?start=240,3.72,3.53,3.548,3.2440000000000007,3.6060000000000003

Our eyes beat out our stomachs so we ordered an appetizer, breaded (and fried) zucchini, avocado and portabella mushroom.  It came with 2 dipping sauces, mayo/chipotle and a ranch sauce.  The flavor of the veggies was ok, but a little greasy. If you follow me you will know we are vegetarian and one of my pet peeves is that we usually have to order a boring salad, veggie burger or pasta with tomato sauce.   Although our choices were in those line the flavor combinations were not boring. I ordered the Santa Fe Salad with Portabella Mushroom (grilled) instead of Chicken.  The salad came out cool and crisp but the mushrooms nicely grilled and warm  The size of this salad was HUGE! Very tasty!! I could not finish the entire thing and even shared some with my partner. My partnered ordered the Evelyn Everything Pasta.  I had a few bites and we both found it delicious! I cannot remember the name of the pasta shape, but they looked like trumpets or even flowers...  We did not order desserts although tempted... our eyes had caught up with our stomachs.   Our order came to $40... it was a great deal!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-seattle?start=240,3.76,3.54,3.596,3.3440000000000003,3.628

I can't stand how some of these reviews talk about a long wait on a weekend. helloooooo dummy!!!!! it's SUPPOSED to be busy. smh. anyway, each time I've came to Seattle to visit my boyfriend, the Cheesecake Factory was always the spot. every time we come in, it's pretty good. nothing to complain about. we come in, tell them our names, and it's usually 5-10 minutes until we get seated. unless it's the weekend, I would expect 15-20. maybe 30. we're pretty lenient. anyway, once we get seated, the waiter/waitress asks what would you like to drink, comes back with the drinks and some bread and asks you what would you like to eat. my boyfriend and I always get the calamari. the last one we went (January 17, 2015), the calamari came out and it was super fresh and hot and delicious!!! I love their calamari, especially with fresh squeezed lemon on top.  my boyfriend orders a shrimp scampi and a steak Diane medium rare and I order a steak Diane medium well. see? no wonder why we're together. anyway, the food comes out and is cooked to perfection. I love my steak with A1 sauce but even without it, the sauce on the steak Diane is pretty good itself along with the mashed potatoes. I'm more of a baked potato girl, but the mashed potatoes that come with the entrée is delicious! oh and the strawberry lemonade is always on fleek. if I feel like munching on some cheesecake, I'd go with the original. sucks that it's the closest to the New York cheesecake, but hey. I can't change the menu. the only reason for the four stars is because I hate when waiters/waitresses switch in the middle of helping us. ugh, if you're gonna go on your break or whatever while you're helping us, don't bother serving us at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-seattle?start=220,3.8,3.57,3.6,3.2800000000000002,3.662

The cashier then suggested the Avocado Egg rolls...ok...but then she told me those were also sold out. I ended up ordering a chicken quesadilla, fire cracker shrimp, and a piece of raspberry truffle cheesecake with no whipped cream.

498,Christopher S.,"Seattle, WA",205,137,12.0,2.0,2015-03-12,"Are you looking to get your entire Recommended Daily Allowance of calories in one sitting?  Is your blood pressure or cholesterol dangerously low?  Are you trying to speed up the progression towards type-2 diabetes?  Well sheesh, do I have the place for you! It's entirely possible (and I am not exaggerating here) to consume upwards of 5,000 calories in a single meal at the Cheesecake Factory without even feeling like you're taking part in a competitive eating event.  On a diet?  Want to avoid Saturated Fats?  You might want to try a kale salad from Whole Foods... as many of the Cheesecake Factory's entrees have upwards of 100g of saturated fat, which is around TEN TIMES the recommended daily value.  It's nothing if not impressive - I'm simply amazed at how much fat (I mean flavor?) CF can pack into their dishes. Let me put this in perspective for you... a healthy, active, adult male needs between 2,200 and 3,000 calories a day to maintain weight.  This means that I (a healthy, active adult male who exercises) could conceivably eat at the Diabetes (I mean Cheesecake) Factory once every two days in between CrossFit workouts and consume enough calories (and WAY too much sugar and fat) to stay at his weight. The food isn't great but it isn't bad, either.  The pasta is usually overcooked and dry (too long under a heat lamp makes the noodles hard again, chef CF) and everything is fried and stuffed with cheese.  Now this isn't a bad thing, but if I'm going to shoot the moon on my caloric, fat and sugar intake, I'm going to do it somewhere where the food is absolutely TO DIE FOR.  Why waste a heart attack on mediocre food? I will say their cheesecake is REALLY, EXTREMELY tasty.  At 1500+ calories a slice, you'll be paying the price.  But if good cheesecake is wrong, I don't want to be right. For someone with a crazy metabolism like me who can eat Phelpsian amounts of food (entire pizzas, pints of ice cream) without putting on an ounce, this place is fine.  There are just so many other fun and reasonably priced restaurants downtown (if you need the familiarity of a chain, just go to Ruth's Chris)...

Last time I went, a few years ago, I remember thinking that the food was SO incredibly unhealthy that each visit was probably deducting a week of my life... Yet, I flaked out last night. After going to the movies, I was feeling the munchies, and I thought, ""why not? Dessert at CF can't be that bad!"" But it was. Lemme first make a note about the service. Everyone, from the host at the door, to the guys behind the dessert displays, to our waitress, were extremely nice and efficient. This review is negative, but it's not about them. It's not their fault they work for this food franchise. Back to the food. All I had was the Godiva Brownie Sundae, and a cup of coffee. The sundae description made it sound delicious. I'm not snobbish enough to pass on Godiva chocolate (even though a lot of folks consider it too commercial and too sweet). I don't care much for vanilla ice cream, but it's passable when complemented by other flavors (as in a sundae). And while brownies aren't my favorite dessert, a chocolate overload is just what I was in the mood for. A few minutes after placing my order, the brownie arrived. As I saw our waitress approach with it, I thought the sundae looked good--even if the ice cream scoops were topped by the awful fluff of whipped cream. I forgot to request to skip it. Oh, well! Without further delay, I proceeded to grab a fork, and dig into the brownie slice closest to me. First off, I was shocked to notice how hard it was (that's what she said!). I thought, ""that's a thick brownie!"". And I was right--partially. The dough was thick, but it was also very cold. It seemed as it had just been removed from a freezer. While not be best dough, it would've been incredibly better had it been warmed up. The vanilla ice cream tasted like Dairy Queen. While I enjoy DQ as much as the next guy on a hot summer day, I expect a little higher quality when specifically going out for ice cream.  The Godiva name was justified via 2 squares of milk chocolate, unfortunately, also cold. Chocolate, in my humble opinion, is better at room temperature, when it's perfectly solid, but you can easily melt it in your mouth. Not when frozen to the point that you have to bite like you do with stale crackers. The best part of the sundae was the caramel. Unfortunately, the plate had about 1 tablespoon of it, which added insult to injury. Overall, an awful experience. I now truly have no reason to ever go back to CF. And now, you've been warned.

In fact, the menu is huge, with a selection of foods ranging from American to Tex-Mex to Italian to Chinese to Japanese to Mediterranean. The menu appears doubly huge because every other page is an ad (for non-sequiturs like clothing and jewelry). For a large party the wide ranging menu makes it easy for everyone to find something they like. It's easy to fill up on the meal without leaving room for cheesecake, so take note! Some of the appetizers alone would pass for entrees at other restaurants. As required by local law, this Cheesecake Factory provides calorie information about every dish on their menu, which can be terrifying to the uninitiated. Don't worry; the portions are very large so the high counts are often covering multiple meals' worth of food on a plate. That said, this ain't health food. And the large numbers aren't limited to the ""calories"" column; prices are above average. My favorite dish here (in fact one of my favorite dishes ever) is the chicken marsala. It's a heaping portion of bow tie pasta with tenderized chicken breast, mushrooms, and an unusually sweet, dark marsala sauce. An order will provide you with 1.5 to 2 meals worth of food. I like it so much that I'm always the first one in our friend group to suggest a trip to the 'factory. The Da Vinci chicken is pretty much the same dish, but with less for your money and less deliciousness. Don't go for that sucker's bet. The miso salmon is also really good. It's served in a bed of white rice, surrounded by snap peas, then smothered in a creamy white sauce that makes you want to lick your plate clean. Despite the salmon and white rice this dish is not healthy. And because healthiness tends to be inversely proportional to tastiness, this dish is mighty tasty! The chicken potstickers are a great appetizer and a staple of mine when I'm not planning on having dessert, or planning on overeating. :) I've been with people who order some kind of salad as an appetizer and end up with a bucket of greens the size of their head, so heads up, so to speak. Also, what are you doing ordering a salad at the Cheesecake Factory? Wait times on weekend evenings are geological. You can skip the line by finding bar seating, which is first come first serve.

297,Alyssa K.,"Fort Myers, FL",383,471,35.0,4.0,2015-07-05,"I was in town for a convention and had to get here a day earlier than the rest of my crew. Rather than order a $30 meal from room service I'm sure would be dry and overcooked, I decided to walk straight over after my seminars and have a drink and wait for some take out.  I went up to the take out counter and of course it took me several minutes to decide what I wanted because the Cheesecake Factory menu is enormous. If you're a ""BigBang Theory"" fan you now have sympathy for Penny. I decided what I wanted and told the friendly takeout guy and he was more than happy to help me, and gave me crap for not ordering cheesecake in a light way. I told him I would wait at the bar for the 20 minutes and if they could bring it to me over there, that would be awesome.  I went over to the bar and asked for the wine list. True to restaurant style, there are fewer by the glass than bottle. No big deal but I'm just a pain because I prefer French and Italian wines and California wines are much more mainstream in America. Nonetheless-had a glass of Chardonnay and had some good chitchat with the bartender about the area and the spots to see.  What was mildly annoying is that the lady sitting next to me sat down and ordered food and it was brought out almost instantly, so I had to go check and see where mine was. Turns out mine was done but nobody brought it to the bar like I asked. No big deal-I had closed the bar check and went up and grabbed it and was good to go. Food was hot, delicious and I had more than enough for two meals since they have a ton of food in each portion.

I am a new Grand-mother, so I was very happy to take my 1mo old grand daughter out for the first time. We told the very smug greeter we had a party of four. She was trying to look over the counter to see what we were carrying and asked if we had a baby. Yes...okay?  Rolled her eyes and informed us that we had a party of five and that the wait would be two hours...long pause and cold stare...""Do you want to wait?""   Me: Yes (mimicking her cold stare). She handed me an electronic buzzer or pager? That was fine but her attitude wasn't. She obviously does not like her job or customers. The sitting area was packed. There were people waiting outside. We sat at the tables outside, which I'm assuming are for outside diners but has turned into an outside waiting area? It's not an attractive area to say the least. homeless people begging in front of the restaurant with trash laying around them, loud traffic everywhere, and customers who obviously look impatient.  My daughter went in to use the bathroom and came out to inform us that there were several bussed tables but they weren't calling on anyone.Two ladies walked passed us and commented with disgust the same thing my daughter had just told me. I was hoping the wait would be worth it.  Our name was called after an hour of waiting. Our host was running a marathon to our table as we followed. He was there and then he wasn't...no pleasantries and a rushed smile. He wasn't rude or anything...just very rushed. I got the feeling of being cattle herded. Our server was really nice. I wish I got her name. She was very pleasant, and yet there was still the sense that it was busy and the staff was stressed out.  The food: I ordered the jambalaya Cajun shrimp and chicken. It was delicious...tender chicken and shrimp over spinach mixed with regular fettuccine pasta. Our server checked on us appropriately and seemed to be more relaxed. She brought me out a birthday desert and the staff sang ""Happy Birthday"" with some customers chiming in. Our server really made my experience pleasant for the moment. I would categorize my experience a bummer due to: The greeter The noise and wait experience outside The hustle hustle get these customers in and out experience Would I visit again?  Probably not.

It was about ten minutes before we could order a slice of cake and 15 minutes before the slice was taken from the counter and put in a to go container.  The cake slice (chocolate fudge) was massive and cost $8.50. I split it with my husband and we couldn't finish it. It was still good the next day.

For starters, it's kind of dark in there. If you plan on seeing your date, your friends, whoever you come with, I wouldn't, because it's so dimly lit that you can hardly even see the menu. Furthermore, while it's one of the things that make it what it is, the menu is insanely large. There are about 5 million things on it, and definitely something for everyone who comes here. Of course, I generally always stick with the (sort of?) winning combination of pasta and a cheesecake. The service every time I've been here as well has been extremely subpar. It's so frustrating in general to be treated with little respect just because you are young. I will continue to come here when my friends want to because in all fairness, though it's a bit expensive, the portion sizes are huge and you get what you pay for. Though here's my tip: Don't get the Evelyn's Favorite Pasta (I thought it was horrendous). I really would give this place a 3 stars but my cheesecake has been slightly frozen every time I've come.

Now as a yuppie, I am venturing to their happy hour which is the focus of this review. I was unaware Cheesecake Factory had a Friday night happy hour until my friend recommended it as a place to avoid large crowds. I loved her description of the happy hour. ""It's not the cool place for happy hour so it's pretty low key but the food is delicious."" I honestly hate crowds and lines with a passion so.. Sounds perfect to me!  The HH bar location is first come, first serve. It was super empty when I got there around 4:30. By the time we left at 6:30, there were vultures waiting for our table. My friend didn't even finish putting on her coat to leave before someone tried to sit at our table! There is a mixture of young and older professionals/couples in the bar area... Therefore people don't care too much about rudeness and perception. I don't recommend a large after work group here unless you all show up at 4 PM sharp!  The happy hour menu is as diverse as you would expect from Cheesecake Factory. There are multiple delicious options for $5 with generous portions. The drinks were $6-7 and had a good balance of tasty and ""whoohoo I'm getting a buzz!"" I wish there was happy hour cheesecake! But alas, there isn't so I brought some home to-go . On a final note, the wait staff was surprisingly attentive despite how filled the bar area was. My water was consistently full and as soon as my alcoholic beverage was gone, I was given the option to order another. I will 100% be back to try more items on the menu with my yuppie posse.

I picked this restaurant to eat at with my boyfriend while we stayed in Seattle to celebrate our anniversary. We went out to eat around 7 & sat in the bar, the place was busy but the bar was not. We ordered chicken nachos with guac & sour cream in the side, the waiter never once wrote our order down; so when the nachos came no chicken. Not a big deal. For our main courses I ordered the California cheesesteak with no mushrooms and a salad, as well as a side of the grilled asparagus. Once again our waiter never wrote down our order. We patiently waited for our food, & as it arrived no asparagus. When our waiter checked to make sure the food was ok after a bite or two was taken I had told him my sandwich had mushrooms on it & my asparagus was never brought out.

642,Melissa S.,"White River Junction, VT",33,12,3.0,2.0,2016-03-25,"I usually avoid chain restaurants in order to sample more local fare. However, for a business lunch, my team chose The Cheesecake Factory. I was the only American, and one of our company had eaten in this chain in many states, so it was kind of a ""I know what we'll get."" We weren't looking for a ""dining experience"", so in that regard, I was not disappointed.  As we were going for a late lunch, there wasn't a line, which was nice. The tables are very close together, which is NOT nice when you have a wheelchair user in your party. We had to ask several people to move in order for us to make our way.  The service was below average. Everyone was pleasant, but there was no engagement, just a crew of employees going through the motions. Our menus were dirty (mine had two of the many pages stuck together by some kind of pastry-creamy-substance... perhaps cheesecake?), our water glasses were dirty (we had to have everyone's glass replaced), and the napkins were stained. It just seemed like a dive restaurant where no one really cared.  Our food was edible and forgettable. It wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't anything to recommend. Since the food was, for better or for worse, the best part of the experience, I have refrained from giving ONE star. The prices are fair for the area.  If you are at the Convention Center and want to go outside for a meal without thinking too much about it, then yeah, it's an option.

Served Over Fresh Vegetables and Farr).  I usually order Chicken Bellagio (Crispy Coated Chicken Breast over Basil Pasta and Parmesan Cream Sauce Topped with Prosciutto and Arugula Salad) which is one of my favorite pastas of all time!  Although, on the occasion that I feel like something less rich overtime I have tried other items off the menu, and I have never been disappointed.  My aunt and I who both love sauteed mushrooms now view their mushroom burger with meat patty covered with sauteed mushrooms, onions, melted fontina, swiss cheese, and mayo as one of our favorite burgers.  Whenever she visits from London, we have to make a stop at Cheesecake for our burger cravings.  My husband and I have found that we also enjoy their Louisiana Chicken Pasta with Parmesan Crusted Chicken Served Over Pasta with Mushrooms, Peppers and Onions in a Spicy New Orleans Sauce.   Their white and wheat bread are both addictingly tasty that I can get full just from their bread!  It is really hard to save room for their cheesecakes!  We tend to take a cheesecake slice to go.  My favorites so far are the both peanut butter versions (still deciding btw Adam's & Reese's), key lime, and the OREO cheesecake.  Definitely need to go on a day diet the day after a visit to Cheesecake Factory unless ordering off of the SkinnyLicious menu, but such a satisfying taste bud experience every visit!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-seattle?start=180,3.36,3.65,3.64,3.124,3.5340000000000003

555,Chelsie G.,"Seattle, WA",0,1,,2.0,2016-07-08,"I will never come here to celebrate with a large group, ever again. On July 7th 2016 I came in with a group of 13 friends, including 2 toddlers, for my 30th Birthday. My husband called ahead to let the staff know (because you don't take reservations) and a good friend came in early to get our spot. All the rest of the guests came in at 6:30 or a little after. We were seated with no problems, all seemed great so far... A waiter took our drink order and an additional waitress, who later became our only server, came to get appetizers going.  Neither of them asked ANYONE what the occasion was, if we were celebrating anything, or if separate checks would be needed. Ok, our group was made up almost EXCLUSIVELY of couples. - it was pretty obvious who belonged with who. So we let it go, thinking... they got this, it's not that difficult. Big mistake. Food came, all was good. The reason I chose to come to CF for this occasion is because I felt the menu was large enough to accommodate most everyone and of course... the cheesecake!  We wanted to order a whole cheesecake to share for dessert. Our waitress unfortunately returned to tell us that the whole cheesecakes were so frozen that it would be 1 1/2 hours before it would be thawed. Ok, We can order slices. No biggie. The cheesecake was great... the lemon raspberry is a must, so is the Reeses peanutbutter cup with layers of chocolate cake!! So delicious!!  But the real problem came with the splitting of the check... or lack of ability to do so by our waitress.  She became very short with us, rude at times and made the act of TRYING to pay for dinner very awkward for everyone! At one point she told us, ""I don't know what all of you ordered"" and ""this has become very confusing"", which was true... the first waiter took half of our orders and she took the rest. But... WE DIDN'T MAKE IT CONFUSING!!! You guys chose to do things that way. We ended up getting a bunch of tickets with the whole table's order on them and each separate check/couple, needed to circle what they wished to pay for. Ridiculous but we cooperated. She left to take payment of one couple's dinner and didn't return for quite some time. My husband saw her and went to her asking if she could please let us pay, we needed to leave because our toddler was having a meltdown.  She snapped at him that she had to go find her manager so she could ""breakdown"" our check. Omg. At this point I became livid and told her as much. She quickly started apologizing and saying how confused and frustrated she was... NO KIDDING?! I really hope a member of management will read this and address the mistake that were made from the beginning. This could have easily been avoided if our servers had asked a few simple questions. It ruined our dinner and my birthday. I don't think our servers even knew, or cared that it was someone's birthday.

We had to wait about 35 minutes to be seated , the restaurant was clean, service was good but the food was mediocre. We'd decided it wasn't worth the wait and hadn't returned but in July family flew in and wanted to eat here. We told them about our first experience and decided mediocre isn't horrible and 35 minutes to wait during dinner hour is about the norm so  maybe a second chance might be in order. We arrived with a party of 8 & waited for what seemed like about an hour to be seated so if u have a large party  be sure to get an early start.  We had part of our group actually leave after checking in and go shopping, we told  them we'd call them when it was time to be seated but we were still waiting to be seated when they returned. I think the hostess actually forgot about us,  we never received a pager. She was telling me the manager had to handle our party from the get go but he/she never showed their face to us and we had to remind her we were there a couple of times. She actually started to seat another large party that arrived after us before us.  Then she said OH your still here, obviously not doing her job. Once finally seated our server was friendly,  fast and very patient in answering our questions regarding menu. Restaurant was clean food was excellent, maybe they hired a new chef.  We would've given them 5 stars  if the wait hadn't been so long. An hour wait with little ones can be a bit trying. When checking in the hostess  immediately said she'd get the manager to speak with me about seating,  I assumed due to our party size but after waiting for the manager 15 minutes I had to remind the hostess we were still there.  I thought it was odd she was getting a manager in the first place. Several minutes go by and again we tell her we hadn't heard from anyone.  She'd given pagers out to other patrons but we never received one.  She actually started to seat another large party that came in after us before us and then seen we were still in the waiting area.    It makes one want to spend their money else where when you see  more than 50 people seated before you that came in after you.  Be prepared to wait an hour to be seated.

I ordered the Little House Salad with vinaigrette to start and the Lemon Garlic Shrimp from their Skinnylicious menu as my entrée. The salad was a good size for $5.50 and the greens looked fresh, but the salad came tossed in the dressing and was absolutely soggy. Gross. I went on hoping for a better entrée, but the quality only got worse.  I have never had more over cooked shrimp in my life. Imagine shrimp so overcooked it has the texture of steak, and dry enough to resemble an old biscotti. They served my shrimp with asparagus, but they included the stalky part of the asparagus, so I couldn't eat several pieces of it. The only redeeming part of the entrée was that the sauce had a balanced flavor. However, as relayed above, the execution was horrible.  I ended the meal by splitting a piece of Strawberry Cheesecake with a friend. It was the best part of the meal.

The total came to $52 w/o tip, so it was really reasonable... I would recommend Cheesecake Factory as a place to go if people in your group want to eat different types of food.

The restaurant doesn't take reservations, so one person in your group has to come in  early to check in and get the wait alarm machine thingy so that you can be on their wait list.

The host asked us if we were all 21 and up, which we said yes. He then says ""you all will have to show your ids, US ids."" Might I add our group consisted of mainly Asian Americans and we were shocked. Actually, I was pretty pissed. First of all, even if we international that doesn't mean they shouldn't be serving us. And second, this isn't my first racist experience encounter at cheesecake factory. A friend of mine spoke to the manager who said they ask everyone that question. From my knowledge, no one is ever asked that and I doubt a group of white Americans would be asked that either. The host was completely rude about it and rolled his eyes at our group.

The steak was really tender and full-flavoured because the steak sauce makes the steak bring out the great tasty. So the steak by itself is delicious enough but  If you eat their steak with bread or rice, you will be astonished by the taste! Also, a side menu was abundant. However, I didn't like the asparagus because it was really bland. Unfortunately, the wasabi mashed potato was much too creamy. The steak is really amazing! When I remember the steak it always makes me mouth-water! I also ate the cheesecake. They have so many different kind of cheesecake.I had tried most of their cheesecake, but my favorite is a Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake because it  is the most creamy and smooth; moreover, Godiva Chocolate makes cheesecake more rich in taste. Therefore,  If you really like creamy texture, you should try the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake.  In Cheesecake Factory, they bring two different kind of bread at the beginning. Anyway, it was really good because it goes well  with any different kind of food. What's more,  my favorite drink is a mango smoothie. They put orange, strawberry, and pineapple on stick in the smoothie. The smoothie tasty was little bit acidic and fruity, so It goes well with the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake.               In Seattle downtown the Cheesecake Factory, it is always full of people. Even though I was really hungry, I had to wait around 20-30 minute; moreover, it had taken so much time until the food came to me. So, if you are in a hurry to eat dinner, I recommend you should go on the restaurant in Bellevue Square. It  is much faster than their  Seattle downtown store.

56,Lynne H.,"San Diego, CA",0,27,1.0,5.0,2017-02-04,"I can't believe I'm doing this.  Yes, our food and service tonight were top-notch.  On par with fine French and Italian restaurants in all but atmosphere -- it does remind me of cruise ship decor -- not offensive, but a bit gaudily ho-hum? . Our wait on Sunday evening was predicted to be 30 minutes.  It was 35.  Fine.  The two of us were seated at a booth for 4.  Lovely for my back and for pushing all that winter clothing to one side. We were looking for simpler food, so we skipped the appetizers and deep-fried temptations.  I'm usually suspicious of ""light"" and ""skinny"" menus, but Cheesecake Factory has my respect on this. Amazing options and execution..   We chose the French country salad, with asparagus, beets, pecans, and goat cheese.  We shared this, and it was quite generous.  The asparagus was cut into bite-sized rounds and perfectly cooked with just a smidge of crunch.  The beets were sweet and there were plenty of them.   And the dressing was a very light, delicate vinaigrette, on par with the one we enjoyed at the French restaurant two nights ago.  By the way, our salad was the same price as that one, and about three times as large.  Size isn't the most important attribute of a portion, but really, greens aren't that expensive.  Sharing this gave us each a nice healthy serving, which we ooh-ed and ah-ed over while trying not to eat it too fast! On to our main course.  We shared the Tuscan chicken.  It came beautifully plated with nice  piles of sauteed (or roasted) cherry tomatoes surrounding three chicken breast filets, well sauced and tender.  More perfectly cooked asparagus spears.  The capers and artichoke hearts added to the depth of flavors.  There was a small pile of farro underneath.  Every last morsel was enjoyed. We did have two baskets of bread.  I went for the brown bread, having forgotten how yummy is, with its molasses sweetness.  I could overdo this easily.  (I have to admit, though, that the French restaurant served some grainy seeded bread I liked even more, but that's another review!) We didn't think we had room for dessert but succumbed to the Godiva chocolate cheesecake.  We ate half and took half home. The mounds of whipped cream didn't hurt. Our waiter, Taylor, completed this experience with his quiet but friendly expertise.  More bread appeared.  Bread was sent home with us, along with butter. (Thoughtful!  We are staying in a hotel.) The remainder of the cheesecake was packaged up.  I make cheesecake, but not quite as decadent as this, so it was a treat. The whole thing was a treat, actually, and we didn't go rolling out feeling like we had eaten to excess.  Our meals were rated at under 600 calories for the chicken and 400 for the salad!  (Don't ask me about the bread and butter, but at 500 for the whole dinner, I could afford some, eh?) Cheesecake Factory, you go to the top of the list!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-seattle?start=80,3.2,3.17,3.484,3.0280000000000005,3.182

The side salad was a bunch of greens with a piece of tomato.  The tomato that was served with the burger was mostly green/white - I opted not to put it on my burger. I also ordered a seltzer and was shocked to see that I was charged $3.75 for it! Service at the bar was great. Unfortunately while sitting at the bar, I watched a server stick a straw in a drink just made at the bar and taste the drink from the straw. He then proceeded to serve the drink to the customer.

208,Peter S.,"Silverdale, WA",0,4,,1.0,2017-05-23,"Extensive menu, but the kitchen's attention to detail is questionable. When taking the restaurant's high volume into consideration, a few blemishes here and there are excusable and depending on their standards, somewhat passable. The servers are well trained and knowledgeable, but recent visits have left a lingering, rather briny taste in my mouth. I'm a young adult and certainly look younger than I am, but I've been in the industry for a long time and tend to tip quite generously. On more than one visit, I have felt that my server, to their demise, has misjudged me as a small spender and cheap tipper and neglected my party as a result. I have sat at tables with empty drinks for 20+ minutes and by the time my server checks up on me, I'd rather spend my money elsewhere. My last visit more than assured that I won't be back anytime soon. My girlfriend and I came in on a Monday evening around 8pm, so we were seated right away. Our server greeted us right away, but didn't return to take our drink order for 10minutes. We ordered some drinks, a small plate to share, and our entrees when she returned. Our drinks and appetizer arrived fairly quickly; however, our small plate arrived without the sauce that I had requested and was left on our table rather abruptly by a food runner that failed to ask if we needed anything else. With the exception of the initial delivery of our drinks, we didn't see our server again until our entrees arrived. We had hardly touched our appetizer because we were waiting to ask for the sauce. For the main course, my girlfriend ordered a chicken dish without onions and received an entirely different menu item. Upon realizing she had sent the wrong dish through, our server quickly scurried away with the plate without saying another word. I didn't touch my plate, which had greasy finger prints around the rim, because I assumed they had just brought the wrong dish and that her food would be brought right out or at least cooked on the fly. A few minutes later, the manager came to our table and sincerely apologized for the inconvenience. He was the highlight of our dining experience. He seemed sincerely apologetic and assured us her food would be right out. I took advantage of his presence and asked for the sauce that never arrived for our appetizer as well as another cocktail. My empty glass had been sitting on the edge of the table for 15-20minutes at this point. He came straight back with another drink and came back shortly after with my girlfriend's dinner. We thanked him for taking care of us and he made sure we were totally set before leaving the table. My girlfriend bit into her entree and found green onions in her first bite, even after specifically ordering and re-ordering the dish with no onions. She has an onion allergy that causes swelling and numbness in her throat and mouth, but has the potential to cause respiratory problems, so it's extremely important that she doesn't consume them. The server came around again after the entree came out and I immediately showed her the green onions on the dish. She responded, ""oh my god,"" proceeded to roll her eyes and scurry back to the kitchen again. The manager came back and again, was sincerely apologetic. He told us that her entree was on the house and even bought her a piece of cheesecake for dessert. By this point, my untouched food sat cold on our table for 30minutes and I had lost my appetite. I ordered another cocktail while he was at the table because our server never stuck around long enough for me to ask. By the time my girlfriend's third entree had arrived, we were both ready to leave. Our server finally came to our table to apologize and see if we needed anything, but we were ready for boxes. We won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-seattle?start=200,2.68,2.99,3.384,2.724,2.8660000000000005

Came for dinner and ordered the Asian chicken salad (which was great!) and the next morning for brunch I ordered the club sandwich. My favorite of the two items was the club sandwich. This is normally served on a buttery croissant, but I opted for sourdough bread instead and it is so much better. Of course for appetizer, we ordered the famous avocado egg rolls which are now a whopping $11.95. The dipping sauce that comes with the avocado egg rolls is great! I love how they serve you complimentary sweet molasses baguette and also sourdough baguette. The service here was good! Our server was very attentive. The hostesses were great at giving accurate wait times. At first when they said 10 minutes, I thought no way there is so many people waiting, but it ended up being less than a 10 minute wait. This location is a large restaurant and they have a lot of tables and booths. You can also have a drink or appetizer in the open seating bar while you wait for your table. Last but not least the Cheesecake! We opted for the lemon raspberry and requested to have it drizzled with raspberry sauce. That was a great idea because it came out looking beautiful and also tasted amazing with a refreshing flavor.

It was still quite busy with a lot of families celebrating graduations present, but we were seated almost immediately. Our server was very friendly and attentive and we enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant.  Having already had lunch, we chose to get dessert instead. I was torn between the Ultimate Red Velvet cheesecake that I got on my first visit and the Key Lime cheesecake. I opted for the second because I felt like something lighter and more refreshing. My husband got the Adam's cheesecake. Both cakes were served with a generous amount of heavy whipped cream which was delicious and it helped cut the sweetness.  The key lime was tangy and light (relatively speaking of course), almost to a point where it was hard to tell if it really was cheesecake. The crust was a nice crumbly texture and wasn't overly sweet. I still found the whole thing too sweet and I struggled to finish the latter half. The portion was a lot larger than what I was used to as well. My husband's selection was a sugar explosion and I couldn't take more than a bite of it. However, it better retained the richness of cheesecake.  All in all, I would say that the restaurant is worth visiting as a once in a lifetime thing if you're from out of town. The calorie counts alone make it a memorable experience! However, I've had cheesecakes that have better suited my tastes and I would much rather pay for something that I can finish.

Apparently they can't exclude cilantro from the items that have it and the waiter didn't know that when he took my order. They kindly let me order something different although I was somewhat disappointing because I was hoping for something Mexican and all of the Mexican food on the menu is full of cilantro.  The new dish I ordered (the Madeira Chicken) was good and they brought it out quickly, which I appreciated. The waiter also brought us complimentary tea for the extra wait, which was a nice touch. In terms of the food, I found it ok. It's not a critique of this location in particular, but I suppose for the chain in general. We did feel that it was expensive for the quality. We enjoyed the dinner, but not overly so. Hubby ordered a piece of Linda's chocolate cake and I ordered the peanut butter cheesecake to take home.

The Cheesecake Factory is a great place to bring picky eaters (since they have the largest menu you have ever seen) and good dessert.   I was eating at the bar this time.  Service is always quick and friendly.  I had a glass of wine and then ordered the sliders and chopped salad. They not only have a great selection, but the portions are generous.  The slider plate including four of them of pretty good size.  They would have made a good meal on their own.  The slider was good, but the bread was not great. I have had the chopped salad a couple of times--it is really good.  It is truly a chopped salad with romaine salad, corn, bacon, chicken, avocado and more--all with a nice vinaigrette.  It is also a generous portion and every bite is tasty. To avoid too many calories, I try to eat enough to avoid dessert.  However, if you have one my favorite is not a cheesecake, but the Apple Crisp. Everything you need to know about how good this place is can be seen by the lines to get in--and also a good place for groups.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-seattle,3.16,3.06,3.36,3.056,3.1000000000000005

13,Nathan J.,"Vancouver, Canada",2,244,83.0,2.0,2017-10-18,"Very disappointing. Never have I been to the Cheesecake Factory where the staff lacked enthusiasm and morale seemed low. It's like they were Sears employees about to receive their layoff package. I have been to a dozen different locations and not once was I disappointed. This time, things were different. We were there on a slow Monday night before 6 pm. The place wasn't busy at all.  Not only did the employees appear they didn't want to be there, the food was not up to the usual TCF standards. The main entrées were served lukewarm. Steak and potatoes seemed like were somebody else's order from several hours ago.  My companion's meal was about the same too. I doubt the food met State or County food safe standards. Our server never bothered to check back either after the entrées were served. In fact the food server was nowhere to be found until we were finished our meals. The only good thing was the dark honey bread. The white was quite hard. It appeared stale from the day before or lunch time.  I feel there seems to be issues with management. Look at the other negative reviews. There's a theme building if you dismiss the rosey or sugar coated positive comments.   The business manaer's response (below) is far from adequate. Their focus seems to be on the lack of attentiveness by the food server when it's obviously more than that. The food temperature and freshness are big issues that need addressing...but it seems that's not going to happen. This location seems to survive only because of location. In my opinion, it leaves a bad impression of the chain to others, especially foreigners.  Oddly there's no wifi at such an expensive establishment.  I just realized that at the time of writing.  We won't be returning to this location. We're beginning to have doubts on this chain whether or not they're having financial difficulties.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-seattle,3.16,3.1,3.332,,3.1240000000000006

My friend got the veggie salad which was fine and there was an order of kids pasta that was eagerly eaten.  We went during the height of lunch rush and waited only 15 minutes. The restaurant was on the loud side. Interestingly, our server was ""on break"" and we had a substitute start us out. I thought that was very odd.

I was pleasantly surprised and admit I studied the novel (I mean 'menu') and all the reviews so I wouldn't waste my time with some subpar dish. I was set to order the egg roll sampler and one of the Asian dishes to compliment.  Wait was less than what the hostess said (30 mins), I wasn't super hangry and I was inspired by the word creamy and sausage and so I ordered a creamy pasta with sausage, pepperoni, bacon marinara sauce from the small portions menu which was soooo tasty and loved the creamy, tomatoey, rich spicy flavor and could not eat the whole thing after eating off my wife's plate which was the chicken lettuce wraps (plus I was saving room for cheesecake). My wife's review of the lettuce wraps were that the 3 sauces were wonderful but the chicken was ""ok"". (She said my chicken lettuce wraps are better). The plate was arranged beautifully and the bib lettuce was perfect for wrapping and although the chicken looked to be well-grilled, I know how chunks of chicken breast can be dry if not done well or allowed to sit out. I loved the sweet pickled cukes and roman noodles as a topping.  My dish came late and I was told it went to another table and then the manger came later and told me ""it didn't have the presentation that they would like""  and he offered me salad or soup - no thanks - I will eat more bread!  The Waitress was attentive, refilled drinks without prompting, asked if we had a time schedule for an evening show and was very sweet. We were cutting it close for time when my meal arrived so my wife and I ordered one lemon rasp cheesecake that was absolutely perfect  after a heavy spicy dish!

I had to dress up to go downstairs (Deli) to get the utensil: The main reason why we ordered delivery was that someone is sick so we didn't have to walk out of the room. Called the restaurant back, manager didn't sound Apologetic at all, instead he said "" Oh well, why didn't you ask for a room service to bring up the utensil?!"" I have never been so mad with anyone but does it make sense for us to tip the room service on top of $75 we already spent? This could easily be the last time I try Cheesecake Factory! (And again it's the restaurant that forgot to put in the knife, not the driver, Cheesecake Factory is not trying to resolve this)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-seattle,3.16,3.16,3.288,,3.1600000000000006
3,Victoria S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",196,6,,1.0,2018-01-03,"The workers are fucking asssssholes. We purchased $125 in gift cars; Which would equal 5 free slices of cheesecake. We have dinner, order cheesecake, and then  nothing. Our waiter says she can't give it to us because we don't have each individual  code. It was my birthday & I have already had the shittiest Birthday. The manager was being condescending the entire time. They threw out the cheesecakes we ordered instead of working things out. If you care about customer service, then don't go here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-seattle,3.0,3.12,3.276,,3.0720000000000005
