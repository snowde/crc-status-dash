902,Sara L.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",232,271,157.0,3.0,2012-01-05,This location is never any different than any other Cheesecake Factory location. They are all busy and they all don't take reservations. This location is just as busy since it is an mall and there are limited selections on where to eat.  The menu is extensive so there is always something to find to suit your needs for meal. I only got one mean look once when I asked for things to be excluded. I chock it up to my server having a bad day (since I saw them get checked by a patron who wasn't looking where they were going).  I've had the Club salad which was nice and it also wasn't drenched in dressing which is an added bonus. The club sandwich is good but it isn't anything special and is kind of generic.  The Navajo sandwich is pretty good but the bread is fried so sometimes they over do the bread and it is just too greasy.  I'll keep coming back here because it is a good alternative to some of the places in the Galleria but It isn't on the top of my list.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=640,3.32,3.44,3.44,2.7640000000000002,3.3920000000000003
59,Brian C.,"Encino, CA",163,545,207.0,5.0,2012-01-17,This place gets packed at lunch time. Sit in the bar area for the fastest seating. Try the new Skinnylicious menu to cut calories. I ordered the Turkey Burger and side salad. Yum. The Patty was delicious and the smaller bun took away the guilt.  I also ordered Cheesecake to take home which I just remembered is still in the fridge!!!    Yikes...  I better go eat it! Don't forget to have your parking validated and visit the Urban Home next store. Love their Home furnishings and stuff!  Hate the mall.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=700,3.44,3.47,3.47,2.9000000000000004,3.458
25,Aidan V.,"Los Angeles, CA",247,741,164.0,2.0,2012-01-21,"It was my mom's birthday and since she likes ""chain"" restaurants, my sister thought it would be great to bring her here.  We were going to meet at 6pm, but they showed up early and ordered without me (shocker). I finally get there and they already ate their appetizers and they wanted to order entrees. I knew this would be a long night unless i quickly drowned a glass of sauvignon blanc. (i was extremely annoyed by my family's 'courtesy'). I order the herb crusted salmon with the asparagus. My plate arrives and its ""warm"", not hot, but warm. My asparagus are over cooked. It was very 'mushy'. My salmon was not fresh. I dont get how people LOVE IT here. Maybe I'm not into it. Anyway- service here is always great but the food is just simply not up to par.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=660,3.4,3.45,3.45,2.536,3.43
44,Kyle O.,"Van Nuys, CA",68,85,13.0,4.0,2012-01-23,"As always, this restauraunt is a lovely place to go to if you are looking for a nice dining experience.  Not too fancy, but a lovely environment that is great for a night out with friends. Like some of the other reviews said, this place can get PACKED!  I called ahead of time to make reservations, and they would not allow it.  Typically, if you have a party of under 3 people, they can seat you fast.  Otherwise, if you are coming during 'rush hour', plan on waiting a bit.  As with most places, outdoor seating is usually first available.  They have a heated patio on nights when it gets chilly, so if you bring a jacket, outside is usually quite lovely. The only other reason this place is four stars instead of five is because of their pricing.  Not to say it's not totally worth it -- because lord knows their food and desserts are AMAZING -- but $3.50 for a coke is a bit silly in my eyes. Overall, a nice place to go with friends!  Just make sure you come with some extra time, and a jacket!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=700,3.44,3.45,3.45,2.8320000000000003,3.446

142,Nicole A.,"North Hollywood, CA",4,8,,1.0,2012-02-04,"I have to say that I am really disappointed with The Cheesecake Factory. Yesterday, my dad was nice enough to bring me home lunch. To make sure the order was crystal clear, he wrote it on his napkin: NO ONIONS! I open up the box and the sliders are smothered in onions...melted into the cheese and everything. Justifiably upset, he called to speak to a manager. The woman asked if she could put him on a ""short hold."" My dad agreed and after being put on hold for 10 minutes, finally hung up. This was one of our favorite restaurants and we were loyal customers, but after this, they won't be getting our business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=880,3.48,3.49,3.49,2.308,3.486
787,Heather W.,"San Diego, CA",1673,907,2600.0,2.0,2012-02-08,"there is a running joke in my family that every time we get together for a celebration meal...i come back here and talk crap about the place. well family - im sorry! i wish it would stop happening. i dont go out of my way to write less-than-stellar reviews. its been a disappointing coincidence :/ mediocre with a splash of insult pretty much sums it up. and maybe that should be the descriptor for most chain restaurants, to be honest, and expected. but with the cheesecake factory especially, ive continued to regret eating their non-dessert concoctions. part of me realizes it was a bit silly to go and order a salad. but hey, specialty salads can be good! they have this delightful ""skinnylicious"" menu boasting low calories and a light meal was all i wanted. the tortilla chicken salad sounded perfect (especially since i--a simpliton---made a pretty bangin' version). hello giant pile of lettuce! hello sad 3 pieces of chicken hidden way below pile of lettuce (im not even lying...look at the pic of how ginormous it is with absolutely no substance). sad, flavorless, unappealing. and charged something like $12. quite possibly the worst and most insulting salad ive ever consumed. had potential if they hadnt cheaped out on the main ingredients. HEY HEARS A THOUGHT: instead of making the size absolutely ridiculously big with filler lettuce - make it NORMAL with a few more pieces of chicken. and while we are at it - take 2 bucks of the price to make it actually appropriate. because the price tag is inflated right along with the cheap iceburg lettuce.  oh but great play indeed finding the most effective way to profit off your menu items - in true chain restaurant form. im guessing this cost *maybe* $2 in ingredients since its made up of iceburg (the cheapest lettuce with zero nutrients) and tortilla strips. come for the cheesecake, stay for the cheesecake. nothing else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=480,3.48,3.47,3.47,2.536,3.474
52,Jennifer S.,"Los Angeles, CA",36,167,2.0,3.0,2012-02-20,"My husband and I are not usual customers of The Cheesecake Factory, but we received a gift card, so we decided to go to the Sherman Oaks location.  We went on Saturday , February 18 around 6:45pm, and the place was packed with a lot of people waiting.  We were told that the wait would be one hour, but we ended up getting seated after 40 minutes.  While we were waiting, we browsed through their extensive menu; I read through it about four times before I decided what I wanted to try. We got seated and our waiter was Ryan, who was very friendly and gave us great service   The bread basket had a French baguette and brown bread, which was delicious.  My husband and I shared the French Country Salad (mixed greens, grilled asparagus, fresh beets, goat cheese, candied pecans and vinaigrette.)  We loved this salad and would order this again!  My husband loves pizza, so he ordered the Spicy Meat Pizza (Italian sausage, prosciutto, pepperoni, spicy \salami, caramelized onions and tomato.) and I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, their most popular pasta dish (shrimp and chicken sautéed with onions, tomato and peppers in a very spicy cajun sauce, all on top of fresh linguini.  I love spicy, so I loved the pasta; so did my husband.  The servings were large, we ended taking home leftovers of the salad, pizza, and pasta dishes. We left room for dessert and shared a slice of Linda's Fudge Cake (layers of rich chocolate cake and fudge frosting with chocolate chips.  To the side was a generous serving of whip cream.  We took half of that home too. Overall, we enjoyed our evening, and the restaurant had a nice ambience.  Parking with validation was only $1.00.  When we left around 8:30pm, the place was still packed with a lot of people waiting.  We're not sure if the food, along with the higher prices, is worth the wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=700,3.4,3.46,3.46,2.636,3.4360000000000004
280,E H.,"Panorama City, CA",3,4,,2.0,2012-02-24,"Last Friday at around 1:00 in the afternoon my friend and I decided to head to CCF to get some lunch and have a few cocktails. we ask the lady if we can have a booth somewhere a little quiet The waitress takes us to the back of the restaurant by the bathroom presenting us to a table. across from it in all its glory was a quiet booth next to the window for a party of two. We asked to be sat at that table. After about 15-20 mins a cute little Mediterranean girl came to our table to take our drink orders I asked the waitress if they carried Ciroc vodka and she didn't know, my friend asked if they had cotton candy martinis, she didn't know that either, but she did offer to go check with the bartender, we gave her alternative drinks if they didn't carry what we preferred I ordered belvedere and pineapple juice and my friend had a patron ultimate margarita. 15-20 mins later she returned empty handed to get the same drinks ordered in the alternative stage of the first visit. I asked for some crab bites as well as some crab wontons. The cute little waitress disappeared for what seems like hours to return again empty handed (no drinks, no bread) to take our food orders. I asked for some bread and water please. She said okay sure, ill get that for you and then again she disappeared for like another 30 mins before she brighten my day again with her smile and my drinks (SARCASM SARCASM) so around the fourth round the food comes, we ask for more hot fresh bread and cuteness (waitress) (SARCASM) smiles and says I will get that right out to you guys... well again she disappears for about 20 mins before returning and saying that the bread will take an additional 7 minutes because it was in the oven.. OK we said and continued to have a good time... Ok this is where it all goes downhill... We ask her to wrap this food up so we can get out and enjoy this sunny Friday afternoon. She wraps up everything and returns with the check... The check is roughly about $100.00 (CRUMBS compared to what my Boo-Thang and I spend on Sundays) we look over the check, drop off $120.00 cash, pick up our belongings and proceed to take the 15 min hike from the restaurant to the car... laughing and being merry the whole way. We are literally seconds from the elevator (in fact just past starbucks) when we hear some African American girl screaming excuse me, excuse me, we never stop to see whom she screaming for because it has nothing to do with us... but this NOISE is getting LOUDER, LOUDER, LOUDER, CLOSER CLOSER CLOSER ... BOOOOOM (this chick was coming for us) she runs right up to us and says (verbatim)  EXCUSE ME LADIES (SARCASTICALLY) YOUR CHECK WAS $91.94 (EXACTLY) AND YOU ONLY LEFT... she open the bill fold and counts out right in my FREAKING FACE RIGHT HERE IN THE FREAKING COURTYARD $120.00 CASH. Then this sweet little African American girl (SARCASM) finds her indoor voice and says I apologize we didn't count the money right, thank you and disappears back to the CCF. Standing there holding my mouth in my hand because I am SOOOOOOOOOOO Appalled at what just happened, my homegirl and I looked at each other and said... we should have asked her for our freaking $28.00 tip back... I told my homegirl I am calling the restaurant to complain as sooon as we get to my house. Get home get settled, called the restaurant and spoke with the manager I forgot her name seeing as she was so helpful, sweet and attentative (SARCASM SARCASM SARCASM) I won't even go into detail about that phone call because it was even more appalling that the girl accosting us in the courtyard.... Ill wrap this up seeing as I have already dragged this story out and imp beating this horse dead for life... I ended up calling there corporate headquarters and speaking with a lady by the name of Colleen.... Oh what a TRUE GEM... (I really mean that) She was everything that I needed to feel better about the experience (FOR REALS)not only was she just as appalled as I was about the experience. She was sweet, apologetic, attentive, ready to please... she listened to me with great concern, she was not dismissive like the restaurant manager. She assured me that she would for sure make up for the bad experience and too looks for something sweet in my mail box... So I am looking forward to that!  I said all this to say... I work in the medical field and I always try to execute the same customer service I would want back, so shockingly I was at my own job on Tuesday 02/21/2012 when I had a new patient, the patient filled out his paper work and proceeded in to see the doctor, after he was seen by the doctor the chart comes to me for billing and coding..

96,Christine P.,"Tucson, AZ",77,12,,4.0,2012-05-07,"Before this weekend, I'd never been to Cheesecake Factory (yes, seriously!), although I've always heard great things. We went for my best friend's birthday celebration with some of her family. We went in and asked for a table for 9, and agreed to first available. The man at the counter was about to give us a buzzer, but one of his associates told him not to, that they could do a table that size right then. They got our table ready and not 5 minutes later led us to it. The party arrived at kind of a trickling pace, and they were very polite, asking each person what they wanted to drink as they arrived, and bringing us fresh bread baskets more than once. Speaking of the bread, I'm not crazy about the white bread, but the brown bread was...addicting. We polished it off almost as soon as it touched the table. Our initial waitress went on break, and had a waiter named Stephen help her out while she was gone. He was hilarious, friendly, and I actually liked him better than the first woman.  I ordered a raspberry lemonade to drink, which came with a margarita-like rim of sugar around the top of the glass. This stuff is great. And with free refills, I drank so much of it before my meal! For the meal I ordered a Skinnylicious Veggie Burger without mayo...not because I was watching my calories, but because it came without cheese, which I don't eat, and it was $1.00 cheaper. It came with a green salad, since it IS Skinnylicious, but I substituted Sweet Potato Fries. The only time I DIDN'T love the service is when I was getting ready to eat but realized there was no mustard at the table and no waiters in sight! After a decent amount of time trying to find and catch the attention of our waiter, my friend's aunt called over a random employee and asked him to bring some spicy mustard. He didn't speak very good English, and brought over regular mustard, but then after we clarified, he brought over some Grey Poupon and I was able to dig in. YUM YUM YUM! The sweet potato fries were cooked to perfection...in fact, some of the best I've ever had. The burger was visually appealing as well as tasty. It was made of various vegetables and grains, and contained beets, which gave it a nice deep magenta color. I was unfortunately so full of lemonade and bread by the time I got my meal that I had to bring a lot of my burger home for dinner, which was STILL good several hours later. I did, however, finish my fries, because fries are never good the next day so I have a thing about eating them all at once! I was SO impressed by this place, from the service to the food, and heard good things from the people I was with about their food, appetizers, drinks, and dessert. It didn't hurt that at a later point in our meal, we realized there was a celebrity sitting two tables away. This place isn't the cheapest, but I will be returning whenever I feel like splurging...or whenever someone else wants to pay for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=820,3.08,3.41,3.41,3.024,3.278
3,Justin W.,"Los Angeles, CA",495,63,13.0,1.0,2012-05-11,"When I agree'd to my girlfriend's offer to have dinner at The Cheesecake Factory, I should've realized right there and then that I got a ""Get Out Of Jail Free"" pass to use during any future mishaps I might get myself into with her. THAT'S how bad this place is. The Cheesecake Factory boasts a menu that is large. No, not large. Gigantic. I dont really know how I felt about a place that serves Orange Chicken, Steak Diane, Wasabi Mashed Potatoes, and Chicken Parmeasean under the same roof, but I was willing to give it a try.  When a menu for an establishment is that large, it means it's either featuring a collection of unique items from speciality chefs around the world OR really, really, really bad food with nothing good enough to be a 'featured' item. Unfortunately, Cheesecake factory falls into the latter. When I can't decide what I want to eat at a restaurant I've never frequented before, I usually go straight for the ""What are they famous for"" factor...however I couldn't eat Cheesecake for dinner. Or could I? No. Not in public. According to the menu, their most popular dinner speciality happens to be a combination of Chicken Madiera (their most popular chicken dish), Steak Diane, and Mashed Potatoes. I ordered the steak medium-rare to  be on the safe side but was a little worried when my waitress dropped off a steak knife to our table before my entree arrived.  Last time I checked, Steak Diane was small enough medallions to where you didn't have to cut them with a knife. My Dinner arrived in a timely fashion, however my level of excitement quickly dwindled once I stared down at the disarranged slop of SHIT-ake (looking) mushrooms covering my main course. My steak was on the left, chicken on the right, and the potatoes in the middle.  The Steak: According to the menu the Steak Diane is ""a mix of sirloin medallions, onions, and mushrooms in a mushroom sauce."" There were NO onions in this mess and literally 50-something mushrooms. The sauce was extremely sweet and didn't match what I have grown up to know what Steak Diane was. I was calling the search for my meat The Great Steak Escape, but once I found my little medallions I understood why I was given a steak-knife. This steak (which was supposed to be medium rare) was cooked WELL DONE with a super gritty and fatty texture that was unappetizing and flat out disgusting.  The Chicken: According to the menu, the Chicken Madiera is a piece of a chicken breast covered in asparagus, mozerrella cheese, and a ""madeira"" sauce. First off, I can see where the word MADiera came from, because this meal pissed me off.  The chicken was flattened to the size of a piece of notebook paper, covered in globs of burnt cheese, and (just like my steak) covered in about 50-something mushrooms. The sauce was exactly the same as the steak diane sauce (imagine that!).  The mashed potatoes were made from red potatoes (which I don't care for) but weren't bad. The asparagus was quite good, actually. I don't cause problems at restaurants and never return food because that animal was still killed for a reason, not to be thrown in the garbage. The Cheesecake Factory is a place for middle-class families that want a big selection of things that they might enjoy yet have a backup plan dinner in case they don't. The only thing that gave this place one star was the professionalism of our waiter and the decor of the resturant. There's much better resturants that have $30 entrees, with food you'll actually enjoy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=620,3.0,3.37,3.37,2.6920000000000006,3.222

Yes, they all look the same and its a little monotonous as far as design goes but its good food that is moderately priced. Our waiter Zack was very professional and attentive. Great service all around. Today was my first time here in a few years and everyone at the table shared an order of tex mex egg rolls appetizer that is complimented well by salsa and an avocado spread. I had the Thai chicken pasta that was amazing; the peanut sauce on it is a killer along side a blue moon beer. And banana cream cheesecake with real bananas for dessert. All delicious items.

940,Peter B.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",39,85,2.0,2.0,2012-05-22,"Occasionally, we will go there because it is close to our home, and the area is nice. That said, there is ALWAYS a rediculously long wait for dinner, and they don't take reservations. One thing that got us upset was our last visit there with friends, just last Sunday the 13th. We sat on the outside patio and had our three kids with us, who were playing near the table. They were not bothering anyone, were not loud, nor disruptive. One of the waiters made a snyde remark stating ""this is not a playground"", which none of us appreciated, and I had to have a word with his manager. If you ever go there, he is about 5-11 +/-, caucasion, little to no hair (Light colored), about 190 lbs. and a trimmed beard. When you see him, remind him that it is customers like us who are the reason he makes money to pay his bills, and above all, to mind his manners!  It is wait staff like him who cost businesses money. I should know, I have fired a few of them in my day when I ran restaurants in NYC. There is no room for rotten attitudes like yours pal!  I, for one, will request a different table If he is our waiter next time we go there.

(and that's when it was PACKED). Service is always prompt and nice. Last time I went my mom and I were rushing before a movie... although I hate when customers rush me, our waiter was so nice and understood and accommodated everything for us.  As far as food choices the menu is like 20 pages long. The bread they bring you (esp. the brown one) is delicious. I always ask for balsamic vinegar or vinegrette on the side and it's enough to hold you over before the food arrives. There are appetizers and small bites for less than 10$ to get you started as well. Some plates I usually get that are always good are the blackened chicken sandwich and the jambalaya pasta. Warning: the desserts are MASSIVE but also delicious. Cheesecake of course, is also great. The decor is also unique and adds a lot of character.

The food is and pretty much always has been just so so it just works for groUPS when you have people with different price points, and when you just want a basic meal. But even a basic meal needs to be Sanitary and clean. I ordered the New Orleans Shrimp to go and the minute I lifted the lid I knew something wasn't right. It smelled awful, I tasted it and it tasted like dirt and grit, like something that should have been cleaned, WASN'T!! I send it back, they bring another, I didn't taste it this time because it smelled better. Get it home and much later heat it, sit down and with just the light from the TV I can see that the shrimp were filthy front and back, and by filthy I mean Completely FULL of shit!!!  For any eating place this is astronomically  unacceptable.  This isn't, oh I didn't like how it tastes. This crap could have made me seriously ill and I mean more than the extreme nausea that I'm feeling today at the thought of the food I did eat there which was also a shrimp dish. I guess I should be happy that I didn't have much of an appetite yesterday, otherwise I would have ingested who knows how much Filth from this place.

The music over the speakers was louder than necessary and the environment overall was very loud.  Our server was friendly. The food was unremarkable.  Our meals can be had at other restaurants for a cheaper price and better taste. The cheesecakes we had were just not that special. The server removed a plate from another party seated next to me and took my plate to put the leftovers in a box. She returned to the other party and gave them my leftovers. Hmmmm... I know it was very busy and she probably did not realize what she did. Also, my water glass was empty for too long before it was refilled. I saw another server set the table next to us for the next group of guests, and I didn't recall seeing the table wiped down before the silverware and plates were placed on the table- again, people are in a hurry.

Their menu is HUUUUUGE so I'm always tempted to try something different; and they never really hit it out of the ball park for me.. except for a couple items. The Good Stuff: The ahi tartare is my favorite. They just do it so right w/ delicious tuna, fresh avocado and the crispy wontons. The spicy crispy chicken sandwich is also surprisingly good, as are their flatbreads. The Meh: So they're supposed to be known for their fried mac and cheese balls.. and I love my mac... but these are awful! Way too fried and nasty and greasy. Just gross. Their pastas are okay and same with the pizza... but if you want pasta or pizza, I would definitely go somewhere else.

I have tried the BBQ chicken salad, Salmon Salad and the Seared Tuna Takiti Salad.  The food was great and dessert was even better.  The only thing I really DON'T like is the service. One of the times I came here with my bf's family (we're Mexican) they made us and another Hispanic family wait over 30 mins while other parties that had gotten there after us with the same amount of people kept getting seated. I don't like to be judgemental and think that the host made our party and the other  Hispanic party wait a long time simply because didn't  look wealthy or like we would spend a lot. But that what it seemed like. Its also funny that they sent us a Hispanic waiter to serve us once we got seated like maybe we didn't understand English.

With past experiences at other restaurants, when you go with a big party the waiter doesn't treat you as good, because typically the party is loud and annoying. This time my experience was different. The waiter we had really did her job. She took everyone's orders, gave everyone excellent tips on what to order, knew exactly who ordered what, and she even kept coming and asking if everything is okay and if we need anything else. She asked us if each of us want to get our own checks and we said yes. She went ahead and conveniently split each one of our orders onto our own individual checks, down to the tip and the tax. The food at The Cheesecake Factory has always been great for me. You can't go wrong with anything that your order. I usually try a different burger each time I go, as I love burgers. This time I got the mushroom burger cooked medium well and it was delicious. I had read a review on yelp while waiting for the food and I was told to ask for the ranch, the review had said that the ranch was amazing and to die for.

The lobby is very small, making it difficult to push through the crowd of people once your table is finally called. The hosts are never particularly friendly. The entire restaurant has a dysfunctional floorplan, you constantly have to dodge people and waiters on your way to/from your table and the restroom, all while trying not to knock food/drinks off other guests tables.

72,Amy L.,"San Francisco, CA",2,10,11.0,2.0,2013-11-29,"This is my first time writing a yelp review because my waiter was just that bad.  I ate at plenty of Cheesecake factory with more customers waiting in line for seats. In fact, when my server was bringing my bf and me to our table, there were so many tables open. We waited for 40 minutes for just a table for 2. Anyways, when I got to my table, I checked my plate and utensils. My plate had dried out green onion like substances stuck on it. My spoon had unwashed dishwasher soap accumulated at the dip of the spoon. My forks had bread crumbs hanging. I was appalled. When I called my waiter ALLEN over, he saw the dirty dish and utensils and took them before I could even complain. That was how bad and dirty they were. He could see them at a further distance in the dim lit room. Then he comes with my new dish and utensils and guess what??? The forks had bread crumbs hanging from them AGAIN! So I called him over and was made sure I held the fork up. I said, ""There's bread crumbs on this fork again. May you get me a new one"" and he quickly took it and slip it into his apron pocket without saying sorry or an explanation. Now I'm wondering how clean any of their dishes really are; especially the ones they serve their pasta on. Anyways, this random female waiter came with our food and she forgot the cheese so she didn't even offer us any cheese. I had to search for ALLEN for 10 minutes and ask for cheese. My pasta dish was already mildly cold when I got it at my table so it was cold when I finally got my cheese. The bread and my dish were very delicious. I was satisfied with my dishes :)  ALLEN was going around the tables making sure everything was okay and he saw us just sitting there waiting for dessert or for the check. He skipped the table next to us who were complaining and my table and disappeared off for another 20 minutes. My boyfriend had to stop him when he came back around to tell him we're done. We were nothing but respectful saying thank you for his service throughout the night so there was no reason for his continued sucky service. When he collected our plates and gave us the cheesecake menu, I didn't even acknowledged his presence and didn't say thank you. He didn't deserve it. I usually tip extremely well, but that was the first time I gave only a $3 tip from my usual $10 tip.

About two weeks later I received a phone call and it was corporate. I cannot remember his name it believe it started with a J.... Anyways he was very nice and asked me to explain what had happened. Once again I relived THAT experience. (We will refer to him as J for future reference) ""J"" followed with many apologies and explained The Cheesecake Factories goal and customer outlook blah blah.  I appreciated the personal call because after two weeks I had assumed I wouldn't ever hear from them. ""J"" asked if it was okay to share what I had told him with the store in Sherman Oaks and I said that was fine. Then ""J"" offered to pay for my dry cleaning of the pants that were ruined and said he was going to be sending me a ""very generous"" gift card ($50 is what I received.)  The disappointment there is that $50 doesn't even pay for the two meals and drinks we had paid for the first time around. Oh well. Can't be to greedy. He told me to go back to the Sherman Oaks one and ask for the manager but to be honest I don't know if I will ever go to that place again without having my sense memory kick in with that horrible vomit smell. So I went to the one in the Marina and it was great. Thank god. Our server was attentive, had personality and boxed my food up for me to go.

910,Jessica S.,"Los Angeles, CA",155,106,41.0,1.0,2013-12-08,"A few weeks ago, my friends and I decided to go out for dinner and we picked Cheesecake Factory because they have such a wide variety of foods. We knew that the wait was going to be a while, it was a Saturday night around 8:30. The hostess told us it would be about 55 minutes.  So 60 minutes later, when our buzzer hadn't gone off yet, we went to ask about how much longer.  Like I said, we anticipated a long wait time but were starving so we wanted to know when we would be called.  The hostess was so unbelievably rude to us- she told us how busy it is and that it hadn't been 55 minutes yet. And I showed her my watch and told her what time we got there and she proceeded to tell me that I was wrong.  THEN when our buzzer went off, we went to stand and wait for someone to take us to the table.  (This process they have is completely bull, they have your buzzer go off so you have to stand in a crowd of other people who's buzzers went off, for another 15 minutes until someone can take you to your table! I don't understand why they can't have the buzzers go off when there's actually someone ready for you.)  Anyway... As we're waiting, the rude hostess is standing there giving my friends and I one of the best evil eyes I've ever seen.  Okay I get it- your job sucks. But there's absolutely no reason for you to be so rude towards me. Especially at this point, where we were just waiting for our table. (That was about 25 minutes past the time they had originally told us)  So one of my friends asks to speak to her manager, after her asking if the hostess had a problem.  As the manager comes over, and she tells him what's happened, him and his lovely hostess are LAUGHING at our situation. He walks over to me, I'm not sure if he thought we didn't have eyes and couldn't see 10 feet away from us? But he puts on his serious face. Apologizes, not for his ridiculously ghetto, rude, uneducated hostess- but for how busy the restaurant is.  I know how busy the restaurant is!! I have eyes!  As he walks away, he again laughs and high fives his hostess.  Our food was delicious and our waiter was as sweet and wonderful as can be. But unfortunately our entire meal was ruined because of how worked up we got over how unprofessional the manager and the hostess were.  So.. Not sure what kind of business that manager thinks he's running, but he's ruined it for us and we won't be returning.  And I understand this is a huge business and one customer isn't going to effect their numbers, but it isn't acceptable to be acting the way they did. Especially in front of customers!  They'll get their karma in the end. The world doesn't like mean spirited people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=640,4.0,3.85,3.548,2.6920000000000006,3.91

Lots of empty tables and we were one of the only taken tables outside on the patio. It was a little chilly outside, but they had the heaters on which made it actually pretty toasty! It was really nice :) Our waitress was kind and polite even when I joined the table (I came late and my friends all had their entrees by the time I arrived), AND when another one of my friends showed up late. I didn't want anything other than a strawberry lemonade and she brought it out to me quickly! She also validated my parking which was awesome!

The drink I ordered had no alcohol and I had to wait about 20 minutes to even have the waitress spare me a glance so I could flag her down and ask to have an extra shot put in.  And lastly it was my mom's birthday, and I told another server in secret (since ours disappeared for so long) and she forgot to tell ours so no candles or singing for us.

Curiously the original menu doesn't list caloric content.  If it's your first time, be prepared to sift through all the menu chapters, as they serve American fare to Americanized versions of international cuisine. I'd say the best food are the appetizers. The Thai lettuce wraps are really good (3 delicious sauces) and fill me up even though they're an appetizer. Tuna tartare - delicious. good size for 3 Sausage ricotta flat bread (off the light menu) with few kinds of cheeses. Good but a little salty.  My friend's veggie salad - big but forgettable. Too much vinegar in the dressing. The fish taco entree was a huge, delicious serving. 4 tacos, big pieces of salmon (I think she requested salmon). However the white cilantro-seasoned rice was oily.   Of course it's hard to pass up on cheesecake here. We devoured my personal favorite, white chocolate raspberry. Others sound tempting. I want to try the pumpkin pecan next fall (Must pumpkin be seasonal everywhere? :/ )  The banana slice is light, almost mousse-like. For me the blueberry white chocolate is disappointing. Service usually is good but today was terrible. Among other things, we had to ask for bread.  At least they compensated with 3 loaves. Isn't the warm brown bread the best?  Parking is free for the first 2 hours free and this location is convenient, right where the 405 and 101 intersect.  It's mainly restaurants here and feels like a ghost town before noon on weekends.

Not once did our server check on us or refill our drinks. I'm not coming back again.  I watched him serve three tables beside us, check up on them and completely ignored us.  Discrimination maybe?  Our server tonight, Dylan, probably thinks that Asians are bad tippers because he obviously didn't to refill our drinks. I watched him go to the tables near ours several times to check on them.

We had a reservation for 9:30 and had requested a booth ahead of time, which we were seated in immediately. The brunch menu was on the smaller side (considering the bulk of the menu) but you could order anything off their menu, not just the brunch items. I was pleased with the genuine kindness of the staff, with everyone who came up to our table wishing my mom a happy Mother's Day. I ordered scrambled eggs, which came with a choice of bread, potatoes, and I opted for the ham option. The ham comes on a separate plate so if you want it mixed in you must cut it up and do that yourself but that was perfectly fine with me.

As soon as we walked in we were seated promptly. I was really happy about that considering it was packed. Why wouldn't this place be packed the food is delish! So I thought- Our waitress noticed the balloons that we had walked in with. Instead of saying happy birthday she asked if we could just move it out of the way. She seemed like she was annoyed or maybe having a bad day, who knows. I tried to not let her attitude bother me.  We ordered a chocolate milkshake for the birthday gal. Also who could go wrong with the southwestern eggrolls, chicken pasta and the buffalo blasts. We got out food all at  separate times. After having had worked ok the restaurant service, you learn to bring out everyone's food together unless otherwise specified. My chicken pasta was the last to be brought out. One night and it tasted extremely overcooked! I tried to eat it but I couldn't and I let the waitress know about the problem. She seemed extremely annoyed and just picked up the plate and walked off. I didn't know if she was going to replace it or what. I was angry at this point but I didn't want to make a scene. After some time had passed, another waiter brought my plate. Since they took so long and the birthday gal was done I decided to just ask for a box. I didn't pay $13.00 to take it home. Our waitress didn't come around to ask if we wanted to order dessert.

I have to compliment them on their ability to handle such a huge menu.. and the consistency it remarkable because of that..

We joked to her about it but she informed us that was the only way to do what they needed to clean the ice bins.. I then commented that at least they (meaning the company) could get her a ""hose"" that wasn't held together with cheap tape.. she chuckled that they had told management that they needed a new one and this was what they returned...

As appetizer we got Ahi Carpaccio and it was amazing. So fresh and yummy with a little avocado and cucumber. It would get it as my meal next time. Avocado rolls are weird tasting ... I am not a big fan of heated avocado. It just losses that creaminess and tastes mushy.   Pit Beef Dip had meat that was perfectly cooked. The only thing I would change, I would not use baguette for it. It is a little too hard even with Au Jus and confused flavors.  Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp was yummy. Keep in mind all portions are huge. They are more than plenty to share. Specially, if you are planning to have some dessert. Disappointing was their healthy Turkey Burger that was lacking in flavor and dry. Our waiter was way too busy to provide good service. He did not seem to care about menu, which is an issue on it's on. As soon as we set down, we got  about 4 or more menus with so many pages and items to look through that we were lost for a long time what we want.

Our waitress came after a few minutes, took our drink order, didn't say anything about the missing silverware and I assumed she was on top of it.   Bread and drinks came, still no silverware. Still giving her the benefit of the doubt, we waited. 10 mins after having been seated, I got up and asked another waiter if we could have silverware and it was brought to the table right away.  Now, about 15 minutes had passed since our waitress took our drink order and she still hadn't returned to take our food order.  I get thats it is friday night and its busy, but she had passed by us and assisted surrounding tables several times and never once said to us something like ""I'll be right over"" or ""I'm sorry, give me another minute"".  So after waiting 15 minutes, I got up to ask the front if they could have our waitress take our order. She then came to our table. She took the order and didn't even acknowledge the fact our table had been forgotten about.  After that, it died down and she was on her game though.  Another waiter started assisting her tables. I dunno if she was over whelmed or what. But after having waited 40 mins for a table, then having no silverware at the table and having to wait almost 20 mins for our waitress to take our order, it was a pretty poor experience.

He came back with the same damn plate of ""steamed"" green beans... The chef took butter smothered green beans and dropped them in boiling water hoping the butter would rinse off. It didn't completely and the oily residue on my hands and on my plate wasn't enough for them to be honest, so whatever. I'm not coming back EVER. I plan to share this with my friends...

Service is always great and always friendly. The menu is so extensive that even the most picky of eaters will find something. Everything we've tried has anyways been great. Their chicken and shrimp gumbo is a recent awesome find. Fish and chips with sweet potato fries is a tasty choice to share.  And no doubt the best cheesecake options around. One slice is perfect to share by three people... or at least that's what we do and are always sweet tooth satisfied. Last week I hit a movie solo and then popped in for take-away and ordered dinner for the three of us at home. Getting the order in was quick, easy and done right.

The food itself was ok nothing special in my opinion just big portions. The pasta was good not too cheesy and not too saucy. The orange chicken was ok, they were big and tender which was nice. We ordered the dulce de leche hot chocolate, and I have to say it was pretty good. Really sugary though. Our waiter was really sweet, kept making sure we were doing ok.

Our buzzer went off fairly quickly, but then after turning it in, we waited another 10-15 minutes before getting seated. Overall, our wait time was 20-30 as promised, but how strange to have our buzzer go off and then receive no acknowledgements for another 10 minutes!! The hosts all seemed annoyed, busy and overwhelmed too which is never a good sign.  Once at the table, we were greeted by our server in a very strange way. She quite literally said she was tired and in the weeds. It was weird. She took our orders and everything came out correctly and considering how busy they were, in a pretty timely fashion. But only half the table received their food. And it was a solid 5 minutes before the other half arrived.

888,Teren A.,"Burbank, CA",0,10,3.0,5.0,2015-03-08,"I have been to this location at least 100 times in my life. The food here has never disappointed me. There are so many options that you can have whatever you are in the mood for and know that it be at the least, good, at best - you will have cravings later. I also have to give a shout out to the happy hour menu. To me, this is the kind of place you can never go wrong with. My faves: miso salmon, chicken bellio, chicken potstickers, the amazing bread basket, all the desserts.  Having been here so many times, I never thought to write a review, until my server on Friday night, Allen S. changed that.  Allen was that good. I was a little nervous when he never bothered to write any of our orders down - we were a party of 5 with drinks, appetizers, and 5 separate entrees. And I was a little bummed when our bread was served cold. (No, no, no - the butter has to be able to melt and drip out of the bread sandwich while you devour it.) But that was remedied pretty quickly.  Our orders came out perfectly, drinks were refilled, we were checked on and just enough times to make sure we were happy, and we were. But what took the cake was that Allen noticed, while carding my son for his alcoholic drink, that it was my son's birthday. We had not mentioned anything at all because it had been a rather solemn day for my son. However, when our server, Allen, noticed the date of birth on my son's ID and took the initiative and time to bring out the celebratory lit candle and song, it lifted everyone's spirits.   On any given day, you never know what that stranger you just came across has been through. It is absolutely true that one act of kindness can help. Allen did that. That kind of initiative deserves praise and recognition. The food would have kept me coming back.

I seeked his advice on how to have my birthday dinner at the restaurant on March 9th at 7pm with about 30 people.  He advised me they do not take reservations, but to come in an hour earlier and put my name down, and since it was a Monday, it is there slowest day of the week so being seated with my group should not be a problem.  I arrived on March 9th at 6:15pm and the manager on duty, her name was Sara and she informed me she could seat my group immediately. I informed her I informed my group to arrive at 7pm but I am in early to put my name down as per the previous manager I spoke to.  The manager, Sara, was soo rude.  She informed me and my boyfriend that she has a server who will be holding the section off for 40 minutes so my party needed to arrive at 7p and at the latest 7:05p or else she will give up our table and the rest of my group will be seated elsewhere. The way she approached me and my boyfriend was very condescending, not accomodating in any way. She came back at 7:05p, huffing and puffing and said she has to give up our table or seat whoever is here. I informed her I was not going to have my friends who drive from Corona and the OC who was stuck in traffic for 2.5 hours to sit somewhere else when it was my birthday dinner. My friends tried to speak to her and she did not care. When my friend informed her that we would carry the group elsewhere her response to us was ""have a good night"". We informed her that she lost a group of 30 people. She did not care. This place is rude, unprofessional, no sense of customer service whatsoever.

523,Scott B.,"Canyon Country, CA",538,980,3113.0,2.0,2015-04-27,"So I just experienced the Cheesecake Factory. Schoolteacher and I had an adventure that landed us somewhat kind of around this area. Remembering that I had been given a gift certificate from my father, I suggested we visit for lunch. We parked in the nearby structure, and walked through the mall over to the place.     After giving the hostess our name, I stuffed the vibrating buzzer thingy into my back pocket, and we discussed our adventures. The place was quite noisy, and the cacophony of the crowds of people waiting for entry into the restaurant, as well as nearby diners made it quite difficult to hear the buzzers alert. However, after some time, I jumped as my left ass-cheek felt the vibrating buzzer informing us that our table was ready. Excited, I returned to the hostess stand, and hostess girl took the buzzer, and said somebody will get you . There we waited for another ten or so minutes. Standing awkwardly in front of the hostess booth before somebody eventually came to get us.      We were led by somebody around the crowded labyrinthian pathways through the throng of tables and eventually seated at a table of our own. I was reminded of those people who work at county fair parking lots, fitting one car right next to another, doing their best to save as much space as possible so they can cram as many cars as they can into a field. We had a couple about a foot our left, and a mother and young daughter about a foot to our right. As we sat down, both couples looked up at us, smiled and politely nodded to us before returning to their personal devices.       Another lengthy wait, and another person came over with menus, introduced himself and took our beverage orders. Person took off and disappeared for some time. Knowing that there would probably be a desert round, I eventually settled upon the Renee's Special, which had some soup, some salad and some sandwich. Schoolteacher went with the Eggplant Parmesan for the same reason.       Eventually, order guy came back with our drinks, and breads. He then took our orders, and left. Presumably the bread was there to keep us busy while he went off for another break or something.  It was quite some time before somebody completely different delivered our food.  Schoolteacher and I chatted about our future plans while we waited for our food.      When the food arrived nearly an hour after ordering, I was quite surprised by the soup. Mainly because order person had neglected to inform what kind of soup came with the special. Turns out it was a baked potato kinda soup. It was quite good though. The salad was also crisp and fresh. The turkey sandwich used a baguette fragment for the bread. With it's rough and super hard exterior crust, it's not a bread I'd have personally made a sandwich from. I was reminded of this several times during the meal when a jagged ridge of crust painfully dug into the roof of my mouth. I'll agree with the other reviewers, the serving sizes are indeed quite large.  I was full before too long. Schoolteacher was also slowing down on her Eggplant Parm. We decided to get everything wrapped up, and order some cheesecake for later.      I asked a random employee passing by for a to-go box, and one was quickly handed too me. We packed up the remainder of bread, and the eggplant and then waited for order guy to arrive. Who showed up eventually. At that point, I asked him for boxes, some to-go cheesecake, as well as the bill. I had hoped to mitigate the excessive time between visits by getting everything all at once.     Packed up foods and bill arrived after another excessive wait. Thankfully, my total was just ninety cents over the gift certificate. I held onto the bill until the cheesecake arrived. I then packed up my to-go items, and left him a nominal tip. Probably more than I should have, but sometimes I'm far too nice for my own good.      We got our parking stub validated, and returned to the structure to leave.  Later on that evening, after our bellies had cleared room, the cheesecake was in fact, quite delicious.    So overall, the food was simply ok. The cheesecake (and I from what I've heard the drinks) is quite wonderful. The service however was as slow as molasses in January.  I didn't know who to complain about because I had fifty different people during the course of the nearly two hour meal. The place is crazy crowded, and as a result, it is super noisy. While here, I somewhat understand why couples don't talk to each other over the table, over the noise and simply stare transfixed by their phones. I did my best to converse with Schoolteacher, and it was quite the challenge. I honestly don't think I'll be back.

691,Karie F.,"PORTER RANCH, CA",260,601,450.0,3.0,2015-05-17,"Went with the fam for a belated Mothers Day Brunch. None of us had been to Cheescake Factory in years so we were excited to go. Katelyn was our server, very friendly and attentive. The food was not so good. Nothing wow'd us and for the price, we all agreed that we won't be back. Let me get down to the nitty gritty of my review. The only good food item we ordered was the spinach & cheese dip appetizer, this was delish!. And thank God for THAT because it took our food over 30 minutes to come out. My Omelette and potatoes were very sub par, I picked out the veggies and cheese and left the rest. I could have got the same or better at Denny's. Matter of fact, IHOP is better and portions are the same size!. No seasoning whatsoever! I felt like I was at the Seniors Buffet. Potatoes, bland and over cooked. My niece ordered french toast. The server that brought it to her, just handed it to her and didn't warn her, it was scalding hot! It burned her hands! She had to hold onto her glass of cold of iced tea to get the burning to stop. They have a weird system here. Your waitress takes the orders and checks in on you and a whole team (like 4 to 5 others, come out and deliver food) I've never seen such a display....it was literally a piece of sourdough bread loaf, sliced off, fried up and served. She said it tasted just like it looked, like a hunk of bread. Who makes french toast out of sourdough??? So basically, very bland, sub par, EXPENSIVE food. I can safely say that none of us will be back anytime soon and I will not recommend.

938,Angela T.,"Van Nuys, CA",2,6,,1.0,2015-05-17,"I've been coming to this Cheesecake for years and I've always been served the absolute best meals accompanied by the best service, which makes writing this review a bit painful. I came to have an early dinner with my parents and we were seated quickly on the outside patio which was quite empty. Our server whose name was Nora and who's the reason why I'm writing this review, was extremely rude and needs another class on how to deal with customers. She didn't greet us, or even make eye contact. She seemed irritated. She asked what we wanted to drink and then our food order. She gave us bread that was sitting on ANOTHER TABLE, so it goes without say that the bread was cold and stale. We ordered soup as our appetizer and she brought that in about 10 minutes. As we're waiting for our food, the outside patio begins to get full and we see people ordering their meals and receiving them shortly after. 40 minutes pass and we call her over and ask her to check on our food. We didn't even know if she acknowledged our question or not because she just walked away. I then noticed her walking to the register and imputing something in the computer. (perhaps our order that she forgot to put in 45 minutes ago?) She comes back 5 minutes later and says the food should be coming out shortly. My father asks her for paper napkins and she looks at him and says, ""Anything I could bring you while you're waiting?"", my father repeats again, ""Paper napkins please"" and she turns her head away and rolls her eyes. Another glorious 15 minutes pass and we see her walking to our table with my mothers and fathers food. She tells me that she's going to go bring mine now. My father ordered his usual plate which was a jambalaya pasta, but it looked more so like a jambalaya soup. He specifically asked for no onions but behold! There were onions. I won't even bother saying how long I had to wait for my food to come, but let's just say my parents were already finished with their food. (What was the point of a family dinner again?). The manager or whoever it was who brought out my food, said my steak Diane was over cooked and that they had to remake it. He said he would take it off the check, which he did. Very long story short, I work in the retail industry which is quite similar to the food industry and we all have our bad days but we never throw it out on our customers. What was supposed to be an enjoyable family dinner, turned into nothing but frustration and anger, and not the best dishes. All I ask, is for better customer service. I don't need meals to be comped off (although it was appreciated), but for servers to show RECOGNITION towards their customers. All in all, extremely disappointed in how we were treated by our server and the kitchen staff with our food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=680,2.96,3.22,3.56,2.372,3.1160000000000005
56,Dez R.,"Chatsworth, CA",51,26,,4.0,2015-05-20,"I recently went here with two other friends and it was very crowded, but I was warned of this before I went, so I wasn't detoured. It took about 20 minutes to be sat, but I didn't mind, we were browsing the menu and looking at the wonderful cheesecake. When we first sat down it had a nice cozy feel to it, and the lighting made it even better. It took some time to get a waiter over, but he was very friendly when approaching us. We ordered a chicken salad sandwich, jambalaya, and some edamame. Our drinks were an oreo shake, raspberry tea, and a water. Now, due to it being very busy and having experience in the food industry, I expected it to take some time for our order, but it took an unusual amount of time for the bread to come to our table, it took about two times of us asking our waiter for bread until we finally received it. However, like everyone has always told me, the food was remarkable, lots of flavor. My overall experience with the restaurant was a big A+. I know the restaurant can't control this, but the only reason it wasn't as good as it could have been was the child in the booth across from ours that was screaming his lungs out. Overall, I recommend this place highly, especially with friends, just be prepared just in case you have the same luck as us! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=700,3.08,3.21,3.564,2.7039999999999997,3.158
757,Jess D.,"Los Angeles, CA",1080,56,16.0,1.0,2015-05-21,"I took my two children here for an early dinner last night after they convinced me to sell one of my kidneys to be able to afford what the bill usually is, but kindly.. I obliged. As usual our bill was basically the cost of a Disneyland admission and just about as disappointing as the overpriced food at a theme park too. I ordered an appetizer and iced tea which was only refilled twice (apparently four tables was too much for our waitress to handle at 4pm) and my children had bow tie pasta off of the kids menu (which is the price of a Coach coin purse for the portion).  Now you would think, how does one screw up bow-tie pasta and butter, right? Well... apparently, Cheesecake Factory can and it's not a problem for their guy in the back at ""the pasta station"".  My younger sons arrived and it looked like something Gizmo from the Gremlin's threw up. The noodles which should only consist of butter and Parmesan cheese arrived looking burnt and covered in brown snot.  My other son ordered the same thing, but asked for no cheese and when it arrived it was dry (no butter, nothing). My older son was so grossed out that he didn't even want to eat anything else once the waitress came back over (after looking for her for about ten minutes). My younger son added his own cold slice of butter (that originally came with the bread) and it just wasn't the same for him, so he didn't really eat it.  We ordered a slice of cheesecake to split and it arrived and wasn't the size of the millennium falcon as I remembered it to be and was $8 (which instead of the Cheesecake Factory staff throwing in for free due to our gremlin vomit that was served to us), they charged us for it and only removed the two child's entrees from our bill, but charged me for the ""free soda"" that came with my sons entree and charged my other son an adult price for his soda.  Our bill was about $29.00 for basically two kids drinks, 1 adult drink, cheesecake and an appetizer.  So if you're into paying for crappy service, getting whiplash from searching for a waiter, and playing a game of ""what the hell is that on my child's plate?"" then by all means, eat here. But be prepared for NO manager to come over an apologize for the mix up and also be prepared for the staff to penny pinch your tab instead of doing what's right and comping your meal.  I still can't get over that they charged me for the free drinks on the kids meals! Really!?  I didn't even fight the price of our final tab, because we had a movie to go to and our waitress was perhaps doing her make-up or taking a hot yoga class, but survey says we will not be returning to this Cheesecake Factory anytime soon.

635,Jordan S.,"Valencia, CA",140,155,3.0,3.0,2015-05-24,"Okay. I have to say, that this place is probably one of the most over-hyped places in all of Southern California.  I have to start with the wait. Everyone waits over 20 minutes for a table whether you have a reservation not. I mean if you're someone who constantly eats out like me, you learn to just accept that some places will have waiting period no matter what.  The thing is, you wait on average 20+ minutes, and the food isn't that great. It's not bad, but it's definitely not something to die for either. Basically, the food doesn't justify the waiting period you have. You wait 20+ minutes for your buzzer to go off, and then you wait another 15 minutes inside for a table to clear. It's quite ridiculous at times. However, the service has always been incredible no matter how busy it is, and the decor is pretty.  The valet is nice, but I do trust my personal parking more than handing the keys to one of the random guys. I have seen some crazy shit over the past many years I have been returning to the Sherman Oaks Galleria. Plus, ou save almost $30 bucks on valet and the self-park is almost always empty from the 2nd floor up. A great parking spot is always certain to awaiting. It's a definite must-try, and I will be occasionally returning. P.S. I do suggest sitting outside. People watching is fantastic for those who do so, and the heaters make the atmosphere the warm-chilly weather that leaves the air nice and crisp. It's less noisy, and less 'traffic'.

The menu is so comprehensive that there is a large ranged of offerings - ""regular American"" as well as dishes inspired by Italy, Mexico, and Asia. Something for everyone! There are aspects of The Cheesecake Factory that seem to open them to ridicule often, and those are true at this outlet too: no reservations, long and uncomfortable wait, very odd ""secondary wait"" after the buzzer buzzes, and spotty service when first seated. Fortunately our wait was not long. Once getting past that we had a nice table on the front patio. Our waitress was sweet and efficient. The food was good... actually, very good... as always. But I almost didn't stay past the first two minutes at the table. My eating utensils, nicely wrapped in a cloth napkin, still had food from the previous user. So did the replacement set... and so did my bread dish. I as totally grossed out at that point. Then I started noticing the significant number of waiters/bus staff with out-of-control hair - both head hair and facial hair.

I always really liked the food, and I knew there was usually a solid wait for a table, but when we finally went to this location last week (our first time at this location) it was to order carry out. So I didn't anticipate that from the time we pulled into the garage to the time we pulled back out with our order, a full hour might pass. Granted, the Galleria is so oddly laid out that it took several minutes to get from our parking space to the restaurant. But the wait inside was needlessly long, too. We finally got home with our food, most of which was good, but we ordered one of the beef dip sandwiches and requested the horseradish sauce on the side. we got that. and nothing else. they gave us a plain beef sandwich with no cheese, onions, OR DIP! It's a beef DIP sandwich. In what world does asking for one condiment on the side equal leave every single thing off? We're lucky we got beef and not just a plain roll, I guess. And the beef was so fatty and grisly I couldn't even chew half of it. What a disappointment.

He was so turned off he didn't eat the rest of it and just requested it be taken off. A manager came over and wanted to ""educate us in how ground beef is prepared"" and ""for next time if we wanted it well done we need to request it that way"" from my culinary understanding there isn't a measure of done vs well done when it comes to ground meats. When you grind a meat you are dispersing the bacteria living on the outside of the meat throughout it, thereby nullifying cook times cause the bacteria is all over it. So long story short, the only for sure safe ground meat is a fully cooked one.  There is no ordering it well done! This place needs to educate their kitchen staff or they will make someone sick!

Today though, the girl gave us no choice and told us to sit in those terrible (no personal space) seats that are in the middle. We asked for a booth and she said ""no that's for parties of 4"". The booths were clearly suitable for 2 people rather than 4. I didn't want to get into it with her so I told her to ""forget it"" & left.  Look Cheesecake Factory, no one likes those terrible middle tables. I went to the one in the grove few days before and they sat my cousin & I in those same horrible seats. However ! That one I understood because they were having a busy night. Today in Sherman oaks though, it wasn't overboard busy and that booth was a perfect fit for 2 PEOPLE !  Idk what you guys were thinking when you made those middle aisle tables but I think they work best for the parties of 4 or more rather than putting parties 2 there. I mean you awkwardly sit there & you can't have much of a conversation cos the people at the other table are at VERY close proximity to you are listening or they start judging what you ordered or THEY'RE JUST AS UNCOMFORTABLE AS YOU !

My girlfriend and I went on a Saturday night so i was thinking the wait was going to be an hour when it was really thirty minutes.  We were seated on the patio and ordered the fried calamari. It was crispy,  mouth watering and scrumptious! not as good as the calamari I tried in San Fransisco but it was a close second.   I also ordered a  long Island Iced Tea. I don't know if It was me or I was feeling like a light weight that day, but It was much stronger than the other long island iced teas I had tried at other restaurants. My girlfriend ordered the Factory Peach Bellini. I was surprised she ordered a drink, because she doesn't drink often and she is an extreme light weight. I was thinking I might have to carry her back to my car, but luckily that didn't  happen.  On to the Entree's! I had the chicken piccata pasta. I was told this was the best pasta on the menu. I was not disappointed with it. The sauce was on point. Creamy, flavorful and a hint of lemon made the angel hair pasta taste like I was at some high up scale Italian restaurant. My girlfriend got the Alfredo Fettuccine Pasta. She enjoyed it. I'll be honest she is picky about her food too. ( I mean i consider myself a good cook, but sometimes she doesn't eat what I make her, like wtf) so she ended up finishing the whole plate. Yup we were that hungry.  Finally we ordered tiramisu. The presentation was remarkable. It looked like a $100 dessert . I was feeling a little fancy after the it arrived on the table. The taste didn't match the presentation, but overall it was still a good dessert. Frankly I am not a big fan of tiramisu anyways so I wasn't disappointed with the taste.

But how do 2 people get their meal, then 2 to 3 minutes later the other 2... and of course my meal is no where to be found. About 3 minutes before the food started to arrive we ordered 2 more drinks, now there are 4 plates, no drinks, and no server to be found anywhere on the patio.

765,Kristin M.,"Los Angeles, CA",67,38,6.0,5.0,2015-11-02,"I don't know why this Cheesecake Factory has 3.5 stars, because out of the all the ones I have been to in Los Angeles, which include Pasadena, Woodland Hills, Marina del Rey, and Beverly Hills this location is the best.  The food is always amazing, and they give you huge portions for what you pay for. My favorites here are: Crab Wontons, Macaroni and Cheese Balls, Chinese Chicken Salad, Chicken Madeira, and my all time favorite is the Chicken Costoletta. I've also had the breakfast dishes as well and they were really good.  Favorite Cheesecakes: Strawberry, Dulce de Leche, Pineapple Upside Down, and I just tried the Salted Caramel cheesecake and it was delicious! If you don't like it too rich I wouldn't recommend it. The service here majority of the time is amazing. Last night my family went out for my parent's anniversary dinner and the waiter we got was amazing, his name was Joseph G., so if you happen to get him you're in good hands. If you come during a busy time or on weeknight or on the weekend, there might be a possibility of getting bad service because of how crazy it is, but I think 99% of the time I come here I always get amazing, if not exceptional service. If you're in a small party of 2-4 people and don't want to wait, I'd recommend looking for a seat in the bar area, you might be able to snag something if it's not too busy and they serve everything the restaurant serves.  My recommendations for people who come here is to get here at least by 5pm, or before especially on a Friday, or a weekend. This location does get busy and you could be waiting 45+ minutes or more. They do not take reservations. The walk from the parking lot is about 5 minutes, or so. Also, Cheesecake factory validates parking for 2 hours, if you're planning to go to see a movie at the Arclight later, I would validate there since the theater validates for 4 hours.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=460,3.12,3.08,3.308,3.0600000000000005,3.0960000000000005

After being promised a piece of free cheesecake for the mishap, I asked for a piece of their popular wheat bread to get the taste of garlic out of my mouth. I asked my waiter, the manager, and a bus boy. The bus boy eventually brought  it.  3. Shortly after receiving my bread, the umbrella touching the heat lamp caught on fire. Another waiter promptly put it out. 4. About an hour after the cup mishap (hey, waiter, are you avoiding us?) we finally receive our food. Hey, how come the cheese in my Mac and Cheese balls isn't even melted? Oh, because it wasn't cooked.  5. The waiter finally comes back over to us and I get another cup of Coke.

We ordered some appetizers, and the mac n cheese balls were all burnt so we ate one then asked the manager not to charge us because the food was burnt. she comes to the the table and starts inspecting the food at the table and making a scene instead of just taking it to the back. Then we ordered dinner, I ordered sliders for my little one from the kids menu which would be 2 sliders and fries, but she said do you want to make it deluxe and add fries? so I say okay not knowing it would increase the price, and add 2 more burgers which I did not want and lied about the fries....just to charge me more... our food was cold. She never brought us napkins, extra sauces.... I don't think I will be going back to this location any more... a RESTAURANT LIKE CHEESECAKE FACTORY, deals with crowds all the time so to see this quality of food it was very disappointing.

They have a terrible seating system. You check in and they give you a pager. Then you wait forever. Then it goes off and you turn it in. They don't take you right to your table, you then have to wait longer while other people are taken to their tables. Then someone finally calls your name and you go to a table. Tonight we waited 10 minutes between the time we turned in our pager to the time we went to our table. For people who have never been here, it's very confusing. You think when your pager goes off, you're going to be taken to your table, not wait in another line! The foyer area is very poorly designed and you have waiters rudely plowing their way through because there's nowhere for the double lines of people waiting to really stand.  Our waiter tonight, while very nice was S - L - O - W. Took our drink order and said he'd bring us bread right away. Took about 5 minutes to get our drinks even though we were right next to the drink station. It took 10 minutes to get bread. Other waiters were bringing bread within minutes of people sitting down. Took a good long while to get our food, but it was very crowded. Then we ordered dessert and it took another 19 minutes for that to come. We were actually in the restaurant for over 2 hours. Then to top it off, we had to pay for parking because we were there so long. We got one refill on our drinks and no refills on bread (I would have loved some more sourdough bread to go with my pasta.

I've been to this location plenty of times and their service seems on and off, really depending more on whether you get a good server/zone or not. The last time I went with my husband and daughter, it was for an early dinner/very late lunch, aound 4-ish in a Friday. As you might imagine, it wasn't exactly busy at this time.  They sat us in a weird corner booth by the corner end of the bar where the servers were having their breaks! The first thing we over hear from some servers are, ""OMG you're such a slut."" ""So? I flirt with everyone. Men, women, that's just me. I even kissed that one dude."" And it went on. My daughter's 3. Call me crazy but we typically don't like to be surrounded by conversations about ""sluts"" when we're out having a family meal with her.  Then the servers got back on the floor and we thought, trying to avoid the inconvenienc of having to move, we'd stay because maybe it'll be OK now. Well, another server came to the designated break table and promptly started complaining about how she did not want to be at work anymore. She's tired, bullshit at work, she wants to go home, etc. Don't know about you but I LOVE Debbie Downers! I don't get enough free complaints and tired, annoyed sighs at work so, of course, soon as I get home I want to go to a restaurant with my family and pay to hear people complain some more! We finally asked to be moved. A very pleasant server took our order. Never saw her again. Another came by our new table and asked if we had been moved and who was our original server. This person was also never seen again. A third person brought out our food, after a much longer wait than we anticipated for such a slow time, and this person really couldn't be bothered.

We decided on Cheesecake Factory, even though my gut said not to. We got in quick, and the menu is giant! It's super crowded and you kinda feel like your a sardine in a very noisy can. Anyway our waiter comes gets us drinks says he'll be right back...20 mins later...entrees ordered, 30 mins later, no entree and empty drinks, have not seen our waiter to ask for refills. All the other waiters fly by as I try to flag one down. 10 more mins, ok food come, a different waiter spills hot grave on my husband, responds, ""oh I didn't know it was spilling."" Cleans it up and scurried away before we could ask for refills or anything else. We are shoveling our food in our faces so we can get to our movie. Our waiter finally comes...to give the bill to the table next to us, without even looking at us, he turns away. I had to Flagg him down to ask for a refill and tobacco. Refills come 5mins later, no tobacco. At this point I just hand him my credit card and ask for the bill. The bill came back immediately. I still have him 20% tip even thought it was a horrible experience and a horrible server. I am sure he was just super busy, but for the price, cheap quality of the food, and the service...never again cheese cake factory.  On a side note: I saw something kinda gross, my they were clearing the table next to us, busser pulls a dirty rag out of his apron and wipes down the table, then puts clean silverware right on the surface of the table.

428,Stina L.,"Los Angeles, CA",410,204,347.0,3.0,2016-03-30,"I'm not sure why I'm even reviewing Cheesecake Factory-- by now, most people have visited it before? I remember when the chain first opened and I loved coming here, but now it's just alright. There are certainly better options, but Cheesecake Factory is always a safe choice. They have a huge menu, with pastas, burritos, burgers-- you name it. The cheesecake selection is also extensive, as you could probably tell by the name-- so this place is great for cheesecake lovers. I came to this Sherman Oaks Galleria location about a week ago with my coworker and a mutual friend for dinner. I just parked in the shopping plaza's parking structure.... make sure to validate your ticket! It cost $1 with validation.  We came on Wednesday night around 6:30pm and didn't have to wait. It definitely gets more packed throughout the night. I ordered my usual -- the Farfalle with Chicken and Garlic (Bow-Tie Pasta, Chicken, Mushrooms, Tomato, Pancetta, Peas and Caramelized Onions in a Roasted Garlic-Parmesan Cream Sauce). The entrees are pretty pricey (I think mine was $16-17) but the portions are huge and I had enough for my dinner and 2 lunches. The pasta is tasty, but definitely on the fattier/heavy side. It's also super garlic-y. This is my go-to item, but I probably will try something else next time. The pasta was drenched in oil after I reheated the leftovers..yuck.  I also got the banana cream cheesecake to-go, which was about $8. So expensive!! I could buy an entire pie at Marie Callendar's for that price. Lol. But it was pretty good... tasted like banana cream pie but in cheesecake form. Overall, Cheesecake Factory is okay.

You wait forever only to be greeted by an annoyed server with zero personality. This has been our experience frequently. Tonight was the last straw. Our server messed up our order, gave an attitude, threw an incorrect replacement at us and proceeded to talk shit about us at the server station so loud my 9 year old said ""mommy she's talking about us."" The manager was completely useless, insincere, and made a sad apology to make up for the humiliation- um sorry that did not cut it. The restaurant is so busy that the staff doesn't have to try to be nice or keep customers. No one cares.  2) You can never find anyone- if you are missing something from your meal or even need a glass of water, good luck flagging down a server even though there are 100s of staff whizzing by. 3) I find all the food to be mediocre at best.

494,Shushanik P.,"North Hollywood, CA",1,37,,5.0,2016-05-12,"I don't know where and how to start my review. I haven't been to Cheesecake Factory in almost a year and a half. I used to go there quite often in the past with family and friends. Due to financial reasons I stopped eating out most of the time.  On May the 2nd 2016, I happened to be in the area and I was starving. I decided to go there since I was close to the shopping center. I walked in and there was no wait, there usually is a long wait, but since it was kind of late on a Monday, no holidays or special events....so I was seated within 5 minutes. There comes a cheerful lady....my server Marisela with a confident, pleasant, nice, professional, and knowledge attitude to take my order. I kid you not, I thought she has been working there for years. That's how good she knew her job, but yet, I found out that she has been there for only 2 months. WOW!!! Shout out to Marisela:)) I ordered their Steak Diane Salmon Combo that came with asparagus and a little House Salad with ranch dressing. My meal tasted DELICIOUS!! DIVINE!! Not to mention that I was hungry the whole entire day.  I was taking small bites, because I didn't want my food to finish:) that's how good it tasted. Marisela kept checking back with me to find out how I was doing and refilled my soft drink twice and asked if I needed any more bread and butter. She was just WONDERFUL in every way and made my dining experience EXCEPTIONAL! I wish almost all restaurants can have great service like Cheesecake Factory does. After I was done with my meal, she asked if I wanted to have dessert, but I refused her offer since I was soooo full. Now, people whoever has had their cheesecake you know how goooooood it is, but I had no room for it. I paid my tab and left her more than 20% tip, because she deserved it!!  I left to go to the bathroom and I didn't like what I saw, the bathroom was not very clean and they had a small roll of toilet paper. However I am NOT going to take down one of my stars, just because of that. I hope the staff will be more on top of their maintenance in the restroom.  Beautiful restaurant, comfortable, setting/lighting, good food, nice music, clean atmosphere and that is all I can say for now.  Will definitely be back soon and I hope to get the same server....Marisela.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=200,3.12,3.18,3.116,3.0920000000000005,3.1560000000000006

I came here today and ordered a hibachi steak and they brought it out cold looked like it sat out for a while and so I told the server that the food is cold, he said they will remake it and it will take 10 or 15 min so I said okay that's fine, another server came back with the same exact plate NOT a new one and again it was completely cold and this time it also looked dry i could see that it was the same plate I'm not really sure what they did with it during that time but it looked worse so I told the server it was cold and dry he said (oh wow yea I can see it looks dry that's not okay) and offered to change it again but at that point I said no thank you this is just unprofessional, so he called the manager and the manager (camron I believe his name was) I explained everything again and he came and offered the same thing to remake it for the third time but as I said that was unprofessional and I was just upset at that point so I asked for the bill and they charged me $14.37 for the rest of the stuff and so first thing I paid it and after I paid I that I told camron the manager that I am just disappointed with that whole situation and that considering that I waited here for almost an hour receiving cold food 2 times and now I am leaving hungry and upset to go eat somewhere else I would not expect the Cheesecake Factory to charge me $14.37 for coffee iced tea and these small things!

This experience was pretty bad as the waiter seemed uninterested and annoyed by us as we had to wave him down every time we needed a refill. I don't care that we didn't see him that much because of his poor attitude but at least refill the drinks every once in a while as we waited over 40 minuets for our food. when the food finally came out we were missing two orders and my son who got lucky enough to get the French fries with his meal were extremely cold.

388,Andrew D.,"Los Angeles, CA",138,142,176.0,4.0,2016-06-04,"The Cheesecake Factory has it's ""ups and downs"". While the food itself is fantastic (I have yet to try anything here that I don't find absolutely delicious), the cheesecakes, shockingly, are just ""mediocre at its best"".        I have tried the ""Chocolate Mousse"", it was ""ok"". I have tried the ""Snicker Bar Cheesecake"", also just ""ok"". ""Hershey's"", just ok, you get the idea... The cheesecakes are just generic in taste. Maybe I am just a dessert snob, but something is definitely lacking in the flavor. Sometimes they're passable, and sometimes they altogether disappoint. From my experience, I deem the downfall to be the cheesecake base itself. I can never taste the cheesecake creaminess of these desserts, even though they are cheesecakes. The consistency is just lacking, unfortunately. Oh well, can't win them all.       I will give praise where it's deserved though; the Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake is a sweet lover's dream. From the chocolate truffle topping, to the caramel pecan coating, and the brownie crust, this one is meant for the books. Also, any of the other ""specialty desserts"" are pretty spot on. Linda's Fudge Cake, Chocolate Tower Cake, and any chocolate cake in general will put you in a gut busting, sugar coma for hours.     Now, for the food. I have ventured out from something as ""health oriented"" as ""The Glam Veggie Burger"" to the heartier entrees like, yes, you know it...the pastas! All great, especially the ones drowning in rich, cheeses sauces (to my recollection as it has been years since my last, cheese heavy pasta here). Recently, I tried the ""Cajun Jambalaya Pasta"" and was blown away. The flavors, the variety of crisp veggies, the sauce itself, will have you wanting to finish the entire plate bite after bite, but you won't be able to. No need to mention this as it is ""The Cheesecake Factory"", but you definitely get your buck's worth in food. So much food! Leftovers!    Service is great considering how mainstream and packed this place gets on weekends and even some weeknights. So, all in all, I recommend The Cheesecake Factory for a nice meal out with friends whether you're looking to socialize, get your drink and greasy munch on, or even for something more formal like a birthday dinner or what not. My recommendation; come early or make reservations (assuming this is an option) if you want to avoid the daunt of waiting (another well known down side to this chain). You'll most likely have a pleasant time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=100,3.52,3.17,3.096,2.416,3.31

This place has to-go service, but if you get cheesecakes to go you may not get all the extra toppings or extra decorative chocolate slashes that goes with it when you dine in.

It was funny and disgusting at the same time to observe one of the waitress's expression of the face when the customer complained that they brought the wrong food for him. They kept us waiting for probably an hour and no one even came to apologize for the long wait even though it wasn't that busy there. I have been to Cheesecake factory in Glendale and have always left that place with a great feeling of satisfaction not only with the food but the welcoming nice atmosphere you feel there thanks to the staff that create that vibe by their genuine desire to provide great service and create a nice long lasting experience. It wasn't the case with the Cheesecake factory at Sherman Oaks location. Very unprofessional, ridiculously rude and unpleasant in their manners and attitude to the customers, as though the customers owe them something. No wonder there are so many one star reviews about the service in particular.  I couldn't wait to leave this place as soon as possible and I will never ever go back to that particular Sherman Oaks location again no matter how delicious the food was.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=380,2.68,3.09,3.052,2.6600000000000006,2.9259999999999997

This isn't the first time my friend and I were treated so poorly here, we gave it a second chance, which confirmed us never returning to this location again. We came here at 9:20 pm with ample time to order and eat comfortably, our waitress was rude, full of attitude, why even bother taking our order? It's not like we ordered appetizers.... Our bill was close to $80. We were done eating and she never bothered to remove our empty dishes from the table, (no big deal, I get it, she's busy helping and clearing everyone else's table), clearly nor busy enough to bring our tab, but still leaves all our dishes in front of us.  My friend and I are looking over our bill, the waitress returns wanting the check (it's 10:21 pm now), we apologize and say we're not ready yet. At 10:25 pm she sends a different waiter to our table asking for the check, my friend asks him why he was asking for the check and his words were ""the waitress is leaving and she wants the check back""   My friend just signs quickly and hands him the check.  Should you not offer to validate parking like every other Cheesecake Factory does? Wow!  Why be rude?  Why send someone else to do your job?  Really?

If that's the case, I do not understand why my order took so long, I do not understand why the attitude towards me was hostile rather than apologetic when I waited almost three times as long as the estimate was on how long my food would take.  I get that it's a very busy time of day, but I didn't order anything complicated, and I wasn't rude at any point, despite having to wait for so long. The least they could have done was apologize for the long wait. My advice is never place a to go order inside the restaurant. Even if you have to stand outside and call it in, you'll be better off than doing it at the counter. And don't bother to tip them. Edit: Took the salad to my (not picky) 97 year old grandma for our weekly lunch and without me even saying anything about how disappointed I was in the service she started complaining about her salad. It looked like something from Applebees.  No color, bland, barely any chicken, all iceberg lettuce, few mandarins, few ""crunchies"". It was the dinner portion but it looked like nothing.

The turkey club can easily be shared with 4 people consider there's 4 big turkey clubs there. It was seriously the best turkey club I've ever had. I still remember the taste. Nothing wrong with Chinese chicken salad, that was also really good.  They should really be careful and pay attention to their forks cause I ended up with a retarded fork.

They are open late and we almost never have to wait longer than 10 minutes for a table. As far as cheesecake factories go, this one is standard. They don't push you off your table. Two large patios with heaters. Sometimes service can be a little slow. I don't think that's any fault of the servers... More so that management understaffs the floor. Over the last few years Cheesecake Factory has really expanded their skinnylicious menu which is great. It is now really easy to get a pretty guilt free yet delicious meal. This is probably the ONLY chain big box restaurant that I eat consistently at. Parking validation for dinner which makes parking cheap, If not free.

My partner checked us in and while the wait was not long before our paging contraption started vibrating, we still waited about an additional 10 minutes inside after returning the device. So their logic is, you go inside, return he device and then they generate a little tag that is put in order for a hostess to then take and seat you. I think it just would make better sense to call you in when the hostess is ready to seat you.  Anyways, once we were seated our waitress took our drink and splitter order relatively quickly. First she brought out their amazingly delicious bread, then brought our our spinach artichoke dip and drinks. So, I am not a huge fan of this dip in general and found this one to be fine. My two monsters and partner loved it, so there you go. We ordered a steak and salmon combo plate, blackened chicken and shrimp and for the monsters chicken Alfredo and grilled veggies.

But where's the cheddar?  The mushroom burger also arrived cheeseless. Again, she told the waiter, ""no fontina cheese, Swiss cheese only.""  Both burgers were reportedly cold and had to be sent back and fixed. Not surprising, the order took almost an hour.

What happened to the tables that were being put together???? We didn't know and apparently they didn't either since they had no real explanation. By this point, 2 hours went by so we're now forced to rush our orders as we had somewhere else to be. Then the bread comes out, but guess what? No white bread. There was no white bread available. We had to wait 10 mins for some white bread. When the food comes out, it was not what most of us expected. 1) Kids spaghetti & meatballs = 1 meatball. Really? 1 freaking meatball? 2) my rice was so undercooked & dried. 3) my brother in laws pasta was rock hard!!!! To try to make all this up, they offer us a Cheesecake. But get this, they only offered 3 slices for a group of 9!!!!!!!! We requested they accommodate the kids and not offer the adults anything. They're response was ""we can cut the slices in half, but each kid cannot get their own slice""??? Really!!!!!! End result, we got the check and got the F out of there.

I decided to wait 5 more minutes. After coming back to front desk and asking what is my place in line hostess replied ""They're cleaning the tables and you will be seated shortly"". She just told me this standard phrase and she didn't even bother to double check. I believed her and waited 15 more minutes. The situation was already ridiculous and I asked some other lady standing near the front desk. She checked my name in line and didn't find it. She asked the main hostess what's up, and she checked also and replied ""well it was there"". After than I was seated. Sound like no big deal...well for me wait 30 or 40 minutes not a big deal. But the way this lady treat me is unacceptable. Excuse me, am I in McDonalds? What's more frustrating - this lady lied to me! She just lied, didn't bother to do her job and finally didn't even asked apology this? No seriously simple ""I'm sorry I messed up with your place in line"" would do. But no...nothing. And you know why? Because she doesn't sorry. She doesn't care. She's there 10am to 6pm 5 days a week whatever. Paycheck is coming and that's it. No efforts to do her job properly.

They take so long to get your orders out. I would not recommend at all ever to order from here. They take so long to give you something you ordered for that is so simple. While I was waiting I saw that they prioritized their waiters and waitresses to give them their orders to give to dine in customers way faster, while they have a huge line of customers waiting for their food or cakes that they have already Paid for.

Since this place is busy most of the time (and can be LOUD) I find take out works much better. I strongly suggest calling in your order (most orders are ready within 20 minutes) and then use the temporary (white zone) parking spots on Ventura Blvd which is right next to the side entrance of the restaurant. The take out counter is right there when you enter this way so getting in and out is a breeze. The food is consistently excellent, though I suggest you check your order before you leave as occasionally they will make a mistake. Customer service is always pleasant and while the food is a little pricey, it's not unreasonable for the quality of the product. I recommend the four cheese pasta and the cobb salad (minus the egg) with balsamic dressing. These two items can also be had on the lunch menu before 5pm.

We waited for a table about an hour and got seated outside. It was a cold day but the heaters kept us comfortable. The lighting is terrible outside and we couldn't see out menus at all. We had to use our phones to see. Our server Danny was nice and friendly and greeted us right away. He told us there was no more wheat bread which was terrible news as I love that bread more than life. We all ordered drinks, appetizers and entrees pretty close to each other as it was late and we were hungry but Danny said he would put the appetizers in first so we would get it before our meals. I went to the restroom while waiting to eat. It was easy to find and not far but the water was way too hot! My hands turned red from it. I complained about it and was told that the water was approved by some company or something and that it couldn't be altered to a cooler temperature. I walked back to my table and noticed all the other tables had wheat bread and I was angry that we were told it was all gone. I found some ready to be served and grabbed it and took it to my table. When Danny later asked me about the bread asking where I got it I told him ""I found it."" He laughed it off but didn't offer me any explanation. Our food arrived shortly after and I complained that we hadn't gotten our appetizers yet and told Danny to just forget bringing it as we were already served our meals. He told us he was sorry and offered them on the house. We all ate quickly as they were closing around 11 and we were the last ones there.  Overall Danny was kind and friendly and apologetic and I don't blame him at all. I just wish it was a better evening for us. The food was fantastic and the meals were all enjoyed.

452,Chris H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,22,,2.0,2017-03-06,"So, to stat out with, I'm a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory. I've had great meals / experiences, but this was not one of them. Two problems, and how management handled them are at issue here. First, my family I were taken by the host to be seated, only to find that the table was not ready. No biggie, except the restaurant was very crowded and we were asked to wait at an awkward drink station in the middle of the room, with servers rushing all around us while we waited. Well, after about four or five minutes, they finally get the table cleared. As we're being led back by the host to the table, the manager steps in and seats another couple. Our host tried to explain that we'd been on our way to being seated for the past six or seven minutes, but this manager refused to here it. Instead, he yelled at a bus boy to quickly clear another table for us. Now the manager didn't acknowledge us. He could have apologized of the inconvenience, but he didn't. We were led to another spot to stand, this time by the bathrooms. Here's were the first problem intersects the second. As we're waiting outside the bathrooms, in an awkward placement that basically puts us in front of another family table, we begin to smell something AWFUL. My wife looks down, and sees that the floor is covered in feces. And the trail of sh*t leads back to the men's bathroom. So someone lets the servers know, and they get a guy to come and start cleaning the floors. Of course, we're checking our shoes, trying to dodge around the ""brown footprints"", when another server shows up and seats ANOTHER couple at the table we've been waiting for - AGAIN! At this point, we've had our table delayed or given away three times, we've been standing in the restaurant over 12 minutes, and there's sh*t all over our shoes. Luckily, our host this time demands we be seated, and we are - right next to the bathrooms. Somebody arrived and sprayed air freshener on the floor, so the odor went from poop, to vanilla and poop. Look, I'm understanding, and didn't raise a ruckus though I could have. We ate our meal and left, but I am disappointed in the manner the management treated us. They should have taken us back to the waiting area instead of standing us in various spots. He (the manager who took our first table away) should have apologized instead of ignoring us. They (the staff) should have done a better job cleaning the floors and offering guests near the smell (it wasn't just us who were suffering) accommodations or the chance to sit somewhere else. If any supervisors from the Cheesecake Factory read this, please train your managers and employees to handle these situations better.

Most recently I went for lunch yesterday with two friends of mine. The wait was only 10-15 minutes which isn't bad for Cheesecake. I always order the same item: Four Cheese Pasta with a substitution of Rigatoni. It's my favorite dish. Sometimes we order a few appetizers or small dishes. This location HAS THE WORST FOOD of any Cheesecake location I've been to. It's just never on point or tastes right. My poor friend ordered a cheese pizza and it tasted like dish soap and smelled absolutely disgusting. It's like they cooked her pizza on a half dirty and half soapy tray. The young male server with curly hair was polite, but he should re-think serving as a career choice. First he forgot my lemonade that I ordered until half way through the meal. Our waters were always low. He never remembered to bring us bread a second time. After I was finished eating, with no water and no lemonade, he finally asked if I wanted a refill. It was too late, I already was dying of thirst the whole meal! He was never within ear shot to call over to tell. My pasta was rubbery and the sauce was bland. My other friend had a salad and hers seemed good. Then, my friend (after only eating a bite of her pizza) told the waiter about the taste of her food and he just said sorry and didn't even offer her a menu or to substitute it for something else. It's never a memorable dining experience and the food is always below average here. I would re-think coming to this location if you are trying to find a nice place for lunch or dinner in this area.

It took her nearly 30 minutes to even bother asking if we would like to order an appetizer and no matter how hard we tried to flag her down she just was not coming back to our table.  Finally I asked a manager for help and he was so busy laughing it up with the other guy in a tie that I honestly don't think he bothered doing a thing.  The last person to order got her food first and sat there with it while the rest of us hadn't even gotten an appetizer yet. Then everything else came at once.  By then we had about 15 minutes to eat and we had told her our movie time. And it was my friend's birthday.

Every time I use the ladies room I regret not going before getting to restaurant. It seems that no one attends to it; there is more toilet paper on the floors than on the holders they belong in. The same goes for the paper towels. Usually the trash is so full that the floor and counters are coated with used papers. It amazes me how messy women can be-my boyfriend said the men's room is not nearly this bad!! Hopefully this will draw attention to the lack of cleanliness. The food is amazing-most times. Twice I have left unsatisfied and both times have been here. One time was a Cobb salad, which seems hard to mess up... I asked for no tomato so they seemed to overcompensate with eggs, the chicken and avocado both had right portions, but under the eggs I went on a scavenger hunt for a few bits of bacon, and even less blue cheese. It was end of the night so I think I got what scraps were left. The worst experience, however was when my entree didn't arrive until my boyfriend had finished his. We ordered an appetizer, and when it arrived placed our entree order. The appetizer came out without the dressing we asked for, and our server seemed annoyed she had to make another trip. Boyfriend got Jambalaya and I went with my favorite-the Chicken Madeira with no mushrooms. Someone different brought the entrees and my plate had mushrooms. I politely mentioned that I told our server no mushrooms and this server took it back. About 6-8 minutes later I convinced my boyfriend to eat so his doesn't get cold. Our server returned to try and correct me by saying I told her no onions-yes, she came to tell me I had said no onions on a meal that doesn't have onions. Pretty appalling she felt the need to argue with a customer (and she was not just unprofessional, also wrong).  My boyfriend finished every last bite before my entree arrived (in the hands of someone else mind you). I asked for a to go box and the manager. He seemed a little embarrassed and apologized for the mishap as well as the unprofessional comments from server. Not the most pleasant experience... Most recent time was a delivery, and was missing bread and cheesecake. Not the end of the world about the bread (although we did request it) but we paid for the cake. The manager was cold when I asked for a solution. I wasn't trying to get anything free, I just wanted what I paid for to be fixed! Go to the Woodland Hills location-you will not be disappointed!!

415,Lea Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",74,108,5.0,2.0,2017-05-27,"4 stars for food quality and large menu selection but 2 stars for service.  Simply awful hostess team.  But we had a fantastic server who helped make up for it. 3 hostesses were working the reception area last night at about 7:45PM when we exited ArcLight Sherman Oaks and made our way to the restaurant to grab a bit to eat.  THREE.  We waited for them to help the two parties ahead of us and then stepped up to the counter to ask for a table for two.  We waited almost 5 minutes for even ONE of the THREE hostesses to say hello, welcome us to the restaurant and tell us it would be a moment.  No acknowledgment whatsoever.  I was a hostess for several years at various establishments.  The number one rule:  make guests feel welcome.  Even if it's just to say ""Hi, give us a few moments and we'll take care of you.""  We didn't even get a simple ""hello"".  When the girl finally acknowledged our presence (she was wearing a necklace that said something like ""Marcela""), she simply said ""How many?""  Again, no hello or greeting or ""sorry for the wait"", just ""how many?"".  We said ""2 please"" and she responded ""inside or outside.""  We said we'd take the first available and she said ""then we can seat you now.""  Great!  Without a word to us, she handed two menus to another hostess and said something so we thought we were going to the table.  She said ""not you - another party.""  This girl was like the Terminator - barely spoke full sentences.  OK, so we stepped back.  Sorry, we thought when she said ""we can seat you now"" that actually meant ""now"".  Nope.  Waited only a few moments or so and then a hostess called our name.  We approached and this girl who had previously been behind the reception desk not acknowledging our presence for five minutes upon arrival flashes a lovely smile and says ""Hi there, let me show you to your table.""  It was like a totally different person.  That lovely smile would have gone a long way when we arrived. This is a teaching moment folks -- if you work in the customer service industry, how about saying hello and welcoming your customers to your business?  It's a nice way to make them feel good and even if there's a wait to be seated, just give some kind of acknowledgment.  Even a friendly smile and holing your finger up to indicate ""one moment"" would be sufficient.  We felt like we were bothering them by even being there.   At the end of the day it's not that big of a deal in the whole scheme of life so I'm wondering why I just wrote three paragraphs about it.  LOL!  I guess it's just a small, simple thing that would go a long way towards making guests feel welcome in your establishment.  If anyone's reading this - maybe teach your hostess team some basic manners and the fundamentals of human interaction.  It would make coming to your restaurant so much more pleasurable. BTW, the food was great as always and our server was OUTSTANDING.  I wish I remembered his name.  He had a wonderful personality, knew the menu inside and out and was helpful, kind and fun.  So good job on the server staff!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=140,3.44,2.94,2.996,2.9200000000000004,3.14

I was thinking to myself, 'how can this be part of the same chain'?  Everything was so different.  The service was terrible, the food was bad, the overall experience was just plain dreadful. We arrived upon opening to avoid the crowds.  Ordered the Fried Zucchini as an appetizer.  I was telling everyone that these would be the best they ever had.  This was based on my last visit in Brea.  Boy, was I wrong and embarrassed!  The Fried Zucchini was the blandest, plain undercooked Fried Zucchini I have ever had.  I had egg on my face and my friends let me know it.  Embarrassing to say the least. The salad as ordered came out just the opposite and had to be sent back twice!  How difficult is it to order a salad and get it right the first time? We ordered our Entree's and again, such a letdown.  The pasta was stone cold and the chicken was lukewarm at best.  Again, I raved about the Pesto Pasta and had it substituted for the normal item, again, I should not have done it.  It was just a terrible dish. In regard to service, our waiter came to us and said he was taking his lunch and the place just opened up.  We were told another server would be helping him.  Guess what, I had to go get more napkins, I had to go ask for more water, I had to go get more silverware, I had to get more condiments.  This was the worst service I have ever experienced!!  People just dumped us and forgot about us. How can two different establishments be so dramatically different?  It is called 'a lack of QA' at the Sherman Oak's facility at all levels.  I really was embarrassed and had to eat crow all day from my friends for a poor choice.  I really would like to know how it was so bad and different.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=20,3.4,3.0,2.992,2.5640000000000005,3.1600000000000006

418,Phil R.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,17,1.0,2.0,2017-07-22,"This is a review of a specific dish at the Cheesecake Factory, not a review of the restaurant.  On a recent visit, my dining companion and I both ordered Shrimp with Angel Hair Pasta. The menu description is ""Large Shrimp Sauteed with Tomatoes, Lemon, Garlic, Herbs and Fresh Basil on Top of Angel Hair Pasta with a Touch of Marinara Sauce"" Overall impression: lacking in flavor...we both thought the dish needed something to make it tastier..the server offered Parmesan cheese which helped a little, but the dish was just under flavored. Perhaps not enough garlic, basil and lemon.  The dish was basically a lot of fresh tomatoes with some shrimp and angel hair There were four or five medium to large sized shrimp on the dish.. However, they were a little tough and lacking in a lot of flavor. Frozen? perhaps...I'm surprised given the volume of shrimp served at the Cheesecake Factory.  I would have to say that my rating for this dish barely gets to average. My advice is to pick something else unless you are really looking for a bland dish heavy on tomatoes.  In comparison, bang-bang chicken and shrimp, one of my favorite dishes on the menu is bursting with flavor and rates very high in my book. (Order it with angel hair instead of rice).

Food: Definitely go with the Avocado Rolls and Fried Calamari for your starters, and they also serve up two types of bread + butter for the table. Their main courses are usually very good, my favorite dish is definitely the Da Vinci Pasta because the sauce is SO tasty- the chicken is usually a little dry though so I recommend subbing for shrimp.

Their Chinese Chicken Salad is really good too, big portion, I would ask for half the dressing or dressing on the side.

We've been to this location before, and it's always good-tasting food, but trying to get healthy options can be super-loaded with sodium. Service was okay, there was a bit of mayhem at the front hostess station, and they didn't seem to have a handle on the waiting crowd. We ordered a lot of small plates and the spicy buffalo chicken sandwich. The stuffed mushrooms were okay. There was a beef broth style of sauce at the bottom of the pan, and it was mostly salt-based. The avocado egg rolls were very mediocre. I was hoping for a bit more seasoning or a textural difference inside, but it was pretty much just bland avocado. I did see small bits of red onion, but there was no taste evidence of it. The crunchy chicken samosas were probably the most unexpectedly tasty option out of all the small plates. The grilled cheese strips are not worth it. Save your money and make it at home. Literally, it's just a grilled cheese sandwich (no fancy cheese or anything) with bacon in it. The spicy buffalo chicken sandwich rocked! The buffalo sauce was a bit sporadic, but the piece of fried chicken was huge and gorgeously crispy. We were getting a bit full when we dove into the sandwich, so we opted to take off the bun, and honestly, it was better with the bun off! The bread added nothing to the sandwich. Overall, if you're in the area, and the other ""higher end"" eatery in the area (used to be one chain of Mexican cuisine, but as of last weekend, a new place was going in), this might be something for you.

349,Vered N.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,57,,1.0,2017-12-22,"Cheesecake factory is our favorite restaurant however this location is getting 1star because of its terrible manager. When I say horrible it's an understatement the MOST UNPROFFESSIONAL EVER. We came in last week with a party of 12, we were quoted 45 minutes, well 1 hour and 45 minutes later we were finally seated, no apologies just terrible attitude from manager.  Now tonight SAME manager. Soon as we walked in to our our name down he with a horrible attitude said excuse me you will need to move and go stand in line ... there was no line for check in only for people who were called to be seated. When he noticed that still no apology, just took our name down. We are quoted 30-40 minutes, as we are waiting about 9 minutes in I see 2 parties that walked in after us seated first. So i question it to the manager and his response  you've only been waiting 9 minutes ( yet I pointed out that they have been waiting for 1 minute and were seated.) he was basically if you don't like it too bad. This guy is either full of himself with his power trip or on something because normal people don't get close to your face like that and act that way. Update add fuel to the fire, they sat us outside 90% of the heaters were not working, and the wind picked up. I asked how long now for an inside table they said we would need to start over, so another 40 min wth! We sat outside, and the manager comes over to say I don't understand why your upset you got a table! Ya in 50 degrees outside no heaters thanks  Update .... here we are 30 minutes after we ordered.... just got my iced tea and no food yet  WORST EXPERIENCE EVER !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=40,2.8,3.03,2.96,,2.9379999999999997

350,Jeremy M.,"Van Nuys, CA",88,37,20.0,2.0,2017-12-25,"I am a frequent patron of many locations of the cheesecake factory throughout the Los Angeles area and I was wondering if there is any possible way to improve the hostess/seating issues at the Sherman Oaks location. The wait times at this locations are outrageous compared to other (more crowded) locations in LA [20+ minutes often times in non-peak hours] and the tables given to me are always the smallest ones in the restaurant. I often speak with the host, the manager, I even attempt to bribe the host for a better seat but they seem very unenthusiastic to help find a table that is not in the busiest, loudest location and smallest table available. Asking for a booth or larger table results in even longer wait times. I never have this issue when visiting locations in Canoga Park or Thousand Oaks - two locations I also visit frequently. I just do not enjoy having the host treat me as if I am bothering them when I arrive and that they are doing me a favor by finding a [terrible] table for me. Anytime I arrive at the location and there is a wait time I just instantly choose another place to eat in the area, as I know I will not have a good experience at that location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=40,2.88,3.05,2.968,,2.9819999999999998
291,Kathy Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",721,126,686.0,4.0,2017-12-27,"This Cheesecake Factory location was my childhood favorite. The wait was 45-75 minutes, even back then, and we'd walk around Tower Records to kill time. Side note: RIP, Tower Records. In addition to a sourdough bread binge, I would order the chicken potstickers, children's pasta (bowties with just butter!) and the chocolate mousse cheesecake... every time. Don't fix what isn't broken, amIright? Well, years and years later, the Cheesecake Factory is still standing and still delivering delicious food. The wait is either terrible or nonexistent, and I haven't yet figured that part out. Sunday brunch isn't crowded, though, so there's that. Nowadays, I'm still binging on sourdough bread. I've since moved on to the Pasta Da Vinci -- hold the onions, swap out the chicken for extra mushrooms. I'll also order an appetizer of some sort -- perhaps the chicken potstickers, quesadilla, avocado egg rolls(!) or fried calamari.  They didn't have the ""small plates"" section way back when, and those are delicious... but quite small. Loaded baked potato tots, crispy crab bites, and ahi tartare are my picks. They are small, though, and not quite worthy of sharing. I always save room for dessert whenever possible, but I usually end up taking it home. The cheesecake varieties have boomed (as have the prices) and I've fallen in love with something new every so often. I recommend the dulce de leche caramel, the caramel pecan turtle, the salted caramel, the white chocolate raspberry truffle, or the white chocolate caramel macadamia nut cheesecake... Notice a pattern? ;)  Note: The cheesecakes are VERY sweet and VERY rich. I can't take in that much sugar in one sitting, so I recommend sharing and taking the slice home. The restaurant validates, so don't forget to turn over your ticket to the server. They don't have machines lying around for you to do it yourself.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks,2.88,3.04,2.972,,2.9760000000000004

Like most people, I want to get the most out of a meal for the best price and $20 for 3-4 chunks of beef is not. I will NEVER visit this location again. I'm a responsible person who rarely writes negative reviews but being treated in such a dismissive manner after many years of patronage is a ""deal breaker!""
