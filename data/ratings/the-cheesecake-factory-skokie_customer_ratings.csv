92,J C.,"New York, NY",7,32,3.0,1.0,2012-06-11,"So, my friends are obsessed with this place. I have no idea why. It's weird because we usually dine at pretty upscale restaurants, and The CF is pretty much an amalgamation of all that we despise when it comes to dining. It really is a ""factory,"" serving mass-produced, bastardized versions of various cuisines and poorly executed American dishes. And yet, it tries to sell itself as some kind of ""fine dining"" experience, which really is quite delusional on their part. I went here for the first time in 10 years last week, and I was bluntly reminded as to why I had stayed away from this place for so long. First off, it took 20 minutes before a waiter even noticed us. Mind you, this was at 2 p.m. when the restaurant was two-thirds empty. When our server finally took our orders and got us water, she asked us if we wanted any bread. Um, we've been sitting here for over a half hour, and you ASK us if we wanted FREE bread? What did you think we were going to say? Too bad the bread was so dry I almost wish I had said ""No"" when she asked. I ordered the spicy chicken chipotle pasta lunch plate, which was described as what would be a ""normal portion at another restaurant."" It was huge, and I really wish it weren't. The chicken was dry, the sauce tasted like thousand island dressing and wasn't spicy enough, and the pasta was severely undercooked. Terrible food, questionable service, tacky decor.

516,J C.,"New York, United States",7,32,3.0,1.0,2012-11-06,"So, my friends are obsessed with this place. I have no idea why. It's weird because we usually dine at pretty upscale restaurants, and The CF is pretty much an amalgamation of all that we despise when it comes to dining. It really is a ""factory,"" serving mass-produced, bastardized versions of various cuisines and poorly executed American dishes. And yet, it tries to sell itself as some kind of ""fine dining"" experience, which really is quite delusional on their part. I went here for the first time in 10 years last week, and I was bluntly reminded as to why I had stayed away from this place for so long. First off, it took 20 minutes before a waiter even noticed us. Mind you, this was at 2 p.m. when the restaurant was two-thirds empty. When our server finally took our orders and got us water, she asked us if we wanted any bread. Um, we've been sitting here for over a half hour, and you ASK us if we wanted FREE bread? What did you think we were going to say? Too bad the bread was so dry I almost wish I had said ""No"" when she asked. I ordered the spicy chicken chipotle pasta lunch plate, which was described as what would be a ""normal portion at another restaurant."" It was huge, and I really wish it weren't. The chicken was dry, the sauce tasted like thousand island dressing and wasn't spicy enough, and the pasta was severely undercooked. Terrible food, questionable service, tacky decor.

Seemed a bit tacky to me even though I was eating in a mall restaurant. I ordered Chicken Bellagio ($14.95), which included two pieces of pounded and battered chicken covered in prosciutto and arugula. This was served on a bed of basil pesto spaghetti (smothered in olive oil). The food was delicious and served on a very hot plate. However, the oil soaked spaghetti made me nauseous for well into the next morning. I don't want to know how many calories I consumed.

402,Michael N.,"Wheeling, United States",37,53,7.0,1.0,2014-03-10,"I think what's most upsetting about writing this review is that the Cheescake Factory of the 90's in the Chicago area is not what it is today.  Today it's like an old tired restaurant that stopped trying.  I was at the Skokie location twice in the last few months and one time it would have been on about a 3 star level in terms of food and service and the most recent really took a plummet. Mimosa's ordered for the table.  On the weak side and the strawberries in there looked as if they sat around for a week or so.  But hey, alcohol is alcohol so let's not base a 1 star review off of that...just a small contributing factor. My order of fish and fries was not good.  I would have expressed it to the waiter had he come around at some point to check in, but he didn't come around until the end.  At that time I was irritated and more or less had a full plate.  The fish was tiny and tasted burnt.  If you ask most folks, I'm not one to complain about food.  I might say it's so-so, but I'll usually still eat it and possibly give a place another shot. When the waiter returned and asked if I wanted the dish wrapped I said ""No thanks, the fish was overdone and not really edible if you can pass that to the kitchen.""  He said ""ok"" and left.  When he returned we were handed a check for all 3 of our meals.  So let's pause here for a moment...if I'm in some random grab'n go place, then my expectations are not that high.  When I'm being asked to spend $80 for lunch for 3, the expectation goes up a bit. The waiter (which I have been several times) doesn't buy the food, cook it, clean the dishes or the floors.  The waiter delivers the food and makes sure that the front of house interaction goes smoothly for the customers along with possibly wrapping silverware or marrying the ketchup.  So I would expect that when I handed back a pretty much full plate and expressed a concern, that the waiter would take some action.  He chose none of that and ignored the problem.  I still left a tip...why I'm not exactly sure, but it was just a couple bucks and well below the industry standard.  I even regret the amount I left but I basically subtracted the cost of the dish from his tip and left that. I realized from the two trips to the Skokie Cheescake Factory what they lack.  Standards.  The waiters clearly don't seem to care and it's not just from this experience.  The time prior to this visit I was with a group all I personally ordered was coffee and had to ask twice for cream, clearly a very complex ingredient.  It's the standards and attention to even to a basic service which are virtually non-existent.  It's almost painfully clear on several of the waiters faces just how much they can't wait to get out of there that day.  The only thing that could top the experience you're destined to have here is if you go home, open a frozen box of fish sticks, throw them into the fireplace for a few minutes and then have a 4 year old overloaded with muscle relaxers serve it to you.  Because at least the standards of the 4 year old would be higher.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=120,2.96,3.12,3.16,2.436,3.0560000000000005

As we were eating, our server finally decides to come around and fill our drinks without being asked (the only perk we had all night).  Other than that, she was never to be seen, and when she came around to fill our drinks again, I quickly asked for the check, knowing she wouldn't be back for the rest of the night.

211,Natalie S.,"Des Plaines, IL",25,14,29.0,5.0,2014-07-09,"I really don't know where to start when it comes to the Cheesecake Factory. I tried it for the first time around 6 years ago and I couldn't believe what I had been missing. I am such a fan.  Important points: 1) This is a GREAT place for pasta lovers. Seriously, you don't know what you are missing. ~(The shining star dish is the Louisiana Pasta, which is divine. Crispy breaded chicken on top, bow-tie pasta with a spicy Cajun sauce and small bits of mushrooms and red peppers. They must put some type of drug in this dish because it is that addictive. Also, the Farfalle pasta is to die for. Bow-tie pasta in a roasted garlic-Parmesan cream sauce with a medley of peas, caramelized onions, tomatoes, and tender chicken pieces. My boyfriend and I always have a deeply internal conflict with choosing one over the other, haha. We always end up getting one for him and the other for myself, and then sharing them both. They are both that good. The Evelyn's pasta is also delicious (penne with broccoli, dried tomatoes, roasted eggplant, peppers, artichoke, Kalamata olives, garlic and pine nuts.) My mom is obsessed with that one.)~ 2) The portions are ENORMOUS. I am a distance runner and have the appetite of a horse, and twice I have made it my goal to finish my entree, but have yet to make it happen. Maybe because I pig out on so much bread beforehand? Also, the pasta tastes just as amazing the next day! 3) Going off of the second point, the bread is AMAZING! You get both sour dough and pumpernickel. It is so fresh and soft that it just melts in your mouth. The bread is almost as exciting as the meal itself. Also, they bring you as much as you want. The only thing I always find irritating is how difficult the butter is to spread because they take it straight from a fridge, but no complaints.  4) I know that I probably do not need to emphasize this...but the cheesecake is heaven on earth. I love cheesecake and this is the place to get it. I have tried so many different flavors, but my favorite is definitely the red velvet. It is enormous and so rich and delicious. The Godiva cheesecake is so deep and rich, great for lovers of rich cocoa. The oreo cheesecake is great, Reese's peanut butter cheesecake is amazing and huge, dulce de leche is smooth and creamy, banana cheesecake is heavenly. Can you tell I have been here a few times? Haha.  5) The prices at this restaurant make it somewhere to go more for a special occasion. I go here for birthdays (which they have always made special by decorating a plate with strawberry sauce and adorning it with a massive slice of cheesecake 0:]), graduations, anniversaries, that type of thing. Definitely not your casual, Friday night type of budget. When my boyfriend and I go, we get two entrees and a dessert to share (and sometimes a soda), and it is always right around $50. So totally worth it.  6) The food is ALWAYS a hit, but it is true that the service can SOMETIMES be a miss. We have definitely had more good experiences than bad, but if you do get a slow server (won't bring out the bread right when you get there), just ask for it. It has never been a big deal. The staff has always been friendly to us, and never slow enough to be aggravating.  *I think it is important to warn that I do not recommend this restaurant for much besides the pasta. The prices just do not justify their other options, in my opinion. My brother felt like being a king, so he ordered the $25 steak, and was not impressed. I am not a steak lover, but do admit that thing was tiny for what he paid. He received a side of fries with it. Just not worth 25 dollars. Go to Longhorn for that. For pasta though, I insist, you will not find better pasta in bigger portions anywhere else. Best place ever. I have also heard rave reviews about their fried mac n cheese, but have never tried it myself. I love this place! Please give it a try on your special day! And don't leave without getting cheesecake!

The only thing I always find irritating is how difficult the butter is to spread because they take it straight from a fridge, but no complaints.  4) I know that I probably do not need to emphasize this...but the cheesecake is heaven on earth. I love cheesecake and this is the place to get it. I have tried so many different flavors, but my favorite is definitely the red velvet. It is enormous and so rich and delicious. The Godiva cheesecake is so deep and rich, great for lovers of rich cocoa. The oreo cheesecake is great, Reese's peanut butter cheesecake is amazing and huge, dulce de leche is smooth and creamy, banana cheesecake is heavenly. Can you tell I have been here a few times? Haha.  5) The prices at this restaurant make it somewhere to go more for a special occasion. I go here for birthdays (which they have always made special by decorating a plate with strawberry sauce and adorning it with a massive slice of cheesecake 0:]), graduations, anniversaries, that type of thing. Definitely not your casual, Friday night type of budget. When my boyfriend and I go, we get two entrees and a dessert to share (and sometimes a soda), and it is always right around $50. So totally worth it.  6) The food is ALWAYS a hit, but it is true that the service can SOMETIMES be a miss. We have definitely had more good experiences than bad, but if you do get a slow server (won't bring out the bread right when you get there), just ask for it. It has never been a big deal. The staff has always been friendly to us, and never slow enough to be aggravating.  *I think it is important to warn that I do not recommend this restaurant for much besides the pasta. The prices just do not justify their other options, in my opinion. My brother felt like being a king, so he ordered the $25 steak, and was not impressed. I am not a steak lover, but do admit that thing was tiny for what he paid. He received a side of fries with it. Just not worth 25 dollars. Go to Longhorn for that. For pasta though, I insist, you will not find better pasta in bigger portions anywhere else. Best place ever. I have also heard rave reviews about their fried mac n cheese, but have never tried it myself. I love this place! Please give it a try on your special day! And don't leave without getting cheesecake! So worth every penny!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=160,3.6,3.16,3.156,2.7399999999999998,3.3360000000000007

282,Michael N.,"Wheeling, IL",37,53,7.0,1.0,2014-10-03,"I think what's most upsetting about writing this review is that the Cheescake Factory of the 90's in the Chicago area is not what it is today.  Today it's like an old tired restaurant that stopped trying.  I was at the Skokie location twice in the last few months and one time it would have been on about a 3 star level in terms of food and service and the most recent really took a plummet. Mimosa's ordered for the table.  On the weak side and the strawberries in there looked as if they sat around for a week or so.  But hey, alcohol is alcohol so let's not base a 1 star review off of that...just a small contributing factor. My order of fish and fries was not good.  I would have expressed it to the waiter had he come around at some point to check in, but he didn't come around until the end.  At that time I was irritated and more or less had a full plate.  The fish was tiny and tasted burnt.  If you ask most folks, I'm not one to complain about food.  I might say it's so-so, but I'll usually still eat it and possibly give a place another shot. When the waiter returned and asked if I wanted the dish wrapped I said ""No thanks, the fish was overdone and not really edible if you can pass that to the kitchen.""  He said ""ok"" and left.  When he returned we were handed a check for all 3 of our meals.  So let's pause here for a moment...if I'm in some random grab'n go place, then my expectations are not that high.  When I'm being asked to spend $80 for lunch for 3, the expectation goes up a bit. The waiter (which I have been several times) doesn't buy the food, cook it, clean the dishes or the floors.  The waiter delivers the food and makes sure that the front of house interaction goes smoothly for the customers along with possibly wrapping silverware or marrying the ketchup.  So I would expect that when I handed back a pretty much full plate and expressed a concern, that the waiter would take some action.  He chose none of that and ignored the problem.  I still left a tip...why I'm not exactly sure, but it was just a couple bucks and well below the industry standard.  I even regret the amount I left but I basically subtracted the cost of the dish from his tip and left that. I realized from the two trips to the Skokie Cheescake Factory what they lack.  Standards.  The waiters clearly don't seem to care and it's not just from this experience.  The time prior to this visit I was with a group all I personally ordered was coffee and had to ask twice for cream, clearly a very complex ingredient.  It's the standards and attention to even to a basic service which are virtually non-existent.  It's almost painfully clear on several of the waiters faces just how much they can't wait to get out of there that day.  The only thing that could top the experience you're destined to have here is if you go home, open a frozen box of fish sticks, throw them into the fireplace for a few minutes and then have a 4 year old overloaded with muscle relaxers serve it to you.  Because at least the standards of the 4 year old would be higher.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=120,3.2,3.16,3.156,2.148,3.1760000000000006

52,Lauren D.,"Chicago, IL",165,372,,2.0,2015-01-31,"They had several choices that were slightly under 500 calories. Prior to going here I went on-line to look at their nutritional menu. I was shocked how much sodium is in nearly every dish. I mean well over 800, and some dishes have over 1,000 or over 1,500 mg of sodium. I ordered from their Skinny-licious section, where items are under 500 calories. I had the Skinnylicious grilled turkey burger, and scraped off all the condiments on the burger. I didn't eat the bun either. The grilled turkey burger was seasoned nicely. It was moist and tender and perfectly cook. However, the black pepper overpowered the burger. For this reason, 3-stars. BTW, my turkey burger came with a small side salad with a variety of greens (no tomato, no cucumbers, nothing else) Basically, a plain and boring salad that was very, very soggy. I didn't eat the salad. However, if you order their ""regular"" Turkey Burger you will inhale 1,370 calories and 1,630 mg of sodium (salt). Definitely not a healthy choice! On the other hand, my husband ordered a double burger which was huge and a mess to eat. It was topped off with four crispy onion rings, loaded with caramelized onions, bacon, cheese and bar-b-q sauce. He said he really liked his burger and rated it with 4-stars. His burger was 1,580 calories and contained 2,990 mg of sodium. Wow, a heart attack waiting to happen! His burger came with fries. He shared a few with me, which were very good. We ended up ordering an extra side of fries without salt. The fries were the highlight of my meal.  We also ordered chicken samosas as our appetizer. Four were served, and they were very, very small and bland. The exterior was crispy, light and flaky. These samosas were served with a dipping sauce. I tasted the creamy white dipping sauce sprinkled with some tiny green specks. It was incredibly bland, and another disappointment. I was expecting these samosas to be similar to the ones we have eaten at Indian restaurants. They were not.  Here is what I walked away with when I counted 166 items on the menu with over 1,000 calories (not a typo) that made me think it must be a very unhealthy restaurant to eat. Too many calories, too much fat, too much refined carbs, too much sodium (salt).  The restaurant was not crowded or super busy considering it was Saturday. We went up the stairs to the second level and were seated immediately near large glass windows. Service was painfully slow. Our water glasses were left empty twice, so we had to keep asking our server for water (otherwise, we never would have gotten a refill on our water glasses). My husband ordered an Apple Crisp to go. I don't eat sweets, so no dessert for me. He said it was ""good"" but nothing spectacular.  This restaurant reminded me of the Rain Forest Cafe, because it is like a gimmick. The interior was gaudy and ornate. We used up our Gift Card and left our Server a generous tip (even though he was awful).

The dish was filling despite being under 600 calories. My sons could not finish their Cashew Chicken, so out of the goodness of my heart, I cleaned up after them.

It was strange because you enter from downstairs, but then have to proceed up the stairs to the podium where the hosts are situated and it's the only area for seating as far as I know. This was a little bit confusing when I first got there, but once I figured it out everything went well. The hosts were really friendly and helpful when I was asking about whether where I parked was alright.  I hadn't seen the girls I was with in 13 years so we spent about four hours at our table, but never felt rushed and we were able to joke around with our server - he made the night that much more fun. All of us were able to find something to please our pallets and made sure to save room for the cheesecake dessert. The variety was nice since one of the girls was on a diet and was able to find something, another girl had dietary restrictions that the restaurant was able to accommodate and I just couldn't decide between three items. I ended up with a spicy chicken pasta that was well made and the portion was big enough that I had leftovers for lunch the next day.

All she had to do is acknowledge us, say she was slammed, and we would have understood. Instead, she chose to ignore us and leave us waiting. Eventually she came to us and asked for our drink orders. We gave our whole order at that time, since we had ample time to decide.  She dropped off the bread first, drinks a while later. Then when we finally got the food, it was so lackluster.

Fast forward several years.....this place is horrible now. The food quality is horrid.  Went today with my mom for a quick lunch.  I ordered an old favorite of mine - 4 cheese pasta with chicken.  It came out completely different.  It use to have chunks of fresh mozzarella, dabs of ricotta, and fresh basil sprinkled on top of the penne and marinara.  Not anymore.  For $17, I got about 1 cup of penne mixed with some nasty red sauce with hard chunks of onions and it was oddly seasoned - like  booze and spicy all in one.  The chicken, I am pretty sure was trimmed fat and yuck, because it was not even edible. My mom ordered the Chinese Chicken Salad.  She said it was okay, but nothing like the flavor it use to be. The server....where was he after we ordered??  No clue.  When he came by with the check, he asked if everything was ok?  Before we could answer is was walking away?!?! Whatever. Won't be back.

While I took well over 10 minutes to get there due to lunch time traffic, the order was still not ready and I spent 20 minutes waiting at the restaurant.

I'm usually somewhat skeptical about large chain restaurants with ridiculously long menus, but every time I come to Cheesecake Factory and try something new it's always on point.  I started out looking through the cocktail portion of the menu. Everything sounded really good, but I went with the pineapple Moscow mule. It came with stoli vodka, pineapple juice, lime juice, topped off with ginger beer, and a fresh piece of pineapple as a garnish. It was delicious and I would definitely order it again.  I got the spin dip as an app (my go to appetizer). It came out hot with fresh tortilla chips, a side of sour cream, and a side of salsa. Also very delicious. The portion size was pretty big though so be careful when ordering apps here if you want a actual entrée bc it's going to be a lot of food.  I got an appetizer as my entree bc I wanted to save room for dessert. I got the corn masa tamale cakes and they are to die for. They are also a really good gluten free option.  I obviously ended the meal w a piece of cheesecake. They have a whole two pages on the menu and the only problem I had was choosing which one to get bc they all sounded amazing. I settled w the lemon meringue cheesecake, and it was another home run. It was not too heavy (which is my usual complaint about cheesecake) and was amazing.  Cheesecake Factory is a little pricey but totally worth it. The food, desserts, and drinks are amazing. Our server was also very good, checked on us a lot (but not in an annoying way), and we never had a problem trying to find him.

It was strange because you enter from downstairs, but then have to proceed up the stairs to the podium where the hosts are situated and it's the only area for seating as far as I know. This was a little bit confusing when I first got there, but once I figured it out everything went well. The hosts were really friendly and helpful when I was asking about whether where I parked was alright.  I hadn't seen the girls I was with in 13 years so we spent about four hours at our table, but never felt rushed and we were able to joke around with our server - he made the night that much more fun. All of us were able to find something to please our pallets and made sure to save room for the cheesecake dessert. The variety was nice since one of the girls was on a diet and was able to find something, another girl had dietary restrictions that the restaurant was able to accommodate and I just couldn't decide between three items. I ended up with a spicy chicken pasta that was well made and the portion was big enough that I had leftovers for lunch the next day. The only complaint is that everything looks and sounds so good, it's difficult to choose.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=80,2.76,2.89,2.98,3.372,2.838

I'm usually somewhat skeptical about large chain restaurants with ridiculously long menus, but every time I come to Cheesecake Factory and try something new it's always on point.  I started out looking through the cocktail portion of the menu. Everything sounded really good, but I went with the pineapple Moscow mule. It came with stoli vodka, pineapple juice, lime juice, topped off with ginger beer, and a fresh piece of pineapple as a garnish. It was delicious and I would definitely order it again.  I got the spin dip as an app (my go to appetizer). It came out hot with fresh tortilla chips, a side of sour cream, and a side of salsa. Also very delicious. The portion size was pretty big though so be careful when ordering apps here if you want a actual entrée bc it's going to be a lot of food.  I got an appetizer as my entree bc I wanted to save room for dessert. I got the corn masa tamale cakes and they are to die for. They are also a really good gluten free option.  I obviously ended the meal w a piece of cheesecake. They have a whole two pages on the menu and the only problem I had was choosing which one to get bc they all sounded amazing. I settled w the lemon meringue cheesecake, and it was another home run. It was not too heavy (which is my usual complaint about cheesecake) and was amazing.  Cheesecake Factory is a little pricey but totally worth it. The food, desserts, and drinks are amazing. Our server was also very good, checked on us a lot (but not in an annoying way), and we never had a problem trying to find him. I just wish they had a patio, but other than that I would recommend this restaurant to any of my friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=60,2.92,2.89,2.988,3.636,2.902

Our waitress had a very unfriendly demeanor and looked annoyed throughout our entire meal. I do not think I saw her smile once...seriously, why are you even in this business? Aside from that, the food was good. The menu offers a large variety so it's quite hard to decide. Both my guest and I decided to settle with salads. I ordered the Luau salad- it was seriously bigger than my head! Not to mention, it was pretty good! It's filled with so many mixings so this salad is super filling!- grilled chicken, pineapple, cucumbers, peppers, green beans, carrots, onions, crisp wontons, and peanuts! Like wow- talk about a salad! My other guest ordered the Santa Fe salad and said the dressing, the spicy peanut vinaigrette, was divine. Surprisingly, at the end of the meal, I was stuffed! I did not pass on the cheesecake though. I mean duh- it's the cheesecake factory.

For lunch I ordered a burger, medium rare and my friend ordered their Asian salad (I forget the exact name).   They came out pretty quickly. My burger was a bit more medium to medium well, but still juicy. It was a good amount of food.  My real complaint is that I ordered a side of cole slaw, which tasted great. It was served in a dish that must have just been taken out of a dish washer. It wasn't warm. It was hot to the touch. I was worried that the cole slaw wouldn't do well. After I tasted it and then felt the dish, I just had one more spoonful and didn't touch it again.  Because it was a business meal, I didn't want to derail our conversation, so I didn't say anything.

I've been asking for it more than one year at dinner time, but they always said out of tuna today. I liked tataki tuna itself, but I wish they mixed tomatoes and avocados together with greens.

The dessert was delayed with a lame excuse that they had to be completed (conflicting ""stories"" from wait staff and managers).  We were never greeted with even a hint of a smile. We seemed to be a major inconvenience to them.  We spent close to $500 and felt we were fools for doing so.  We discussed our unhappiness with 2 managers.  Wow, are they lame!  They must be on the defensive often because they both greeted us with huge attitudes and really didn't have any concern for our satisfaction at all!  The kicker is that they even fixed the tip after taxes.  No way were we going to spend 30% on a tip for service that we didn't receive!

[LOVE]  + Super antioxidant salad (surprise you'll be very satisfied!)  + Thai lettuce wrap (not appetizer! It can be entree!!) + Pasta napoletana (good for left over lunch) + Grilled Salmon (not very special, but always good!) +BLT salad (please make your way baaaaackkk!!!!! Love you!!!)

They need to work on more lighter sweets like soufflé, baked cheesecake, panna cotta, etc) + Espresso drinks & coffee (so sad) + Tacos (always cold... Why?) They have lots of varieties for meal choices. Americans, Mexicans, Italians, and Asians! At my recent visit for lunch, I finally got ahi tuna! I mean seared tuna tataki salad. I've been asking for it more than one year at dinner time, but they always said out of tuna today. I liked tataki tuna itself, but I wish they mixed tomatoes and avocados together with greens. I feel like they are left a part.  I wish BLT SALAD will come back to menu. I felt in love with it at my very first visit at the Cheesecake Factory. It was so memorable, delicious, and of course so fresh! Very clean and moody atmosphere, but good for family too! Service is always good :) Good for date night and special celebrations, but I just come here maybe once in a month or two months for varieties of food!  *Suggestions Besides BLT Salas's coming back to menu and working on new lighter desserts, I wish Sunday brunch would be available on Saturday, too!

I went at 3:25 to give them extra time ...just in case. It wasn't ready and then they couldn't find the cake. I paid extra for a happy birthday on the cheesecake. Of course it wasn't done. Their excuse was that they had so many cakes in the freezer b/c it was Mother's Day (I ordered mine for a Friday and Mother's Day was not for 2 more days) They should have given me the extra happy birthday piece of chocolate free as a courtesy considering that I had to wait another 30minutes while they tried add the writing. I will never order from here again! This just shows poor management. The restaurant need to reevaluate their system and either re-train their employees or hire new ones. They need a new manager. The food and cake is not worth the poor service! To make my experience even worse- no apology and the they threw my cake at me and was really abrupt and annoyed. I should have asked for the manager ... my problem was that I was didn't get mad but waited patiently.

It was a bunch of stale chips with some cheese and hot sauce... no guac, no sour cream, no pico de gallo, not jalapeños, and no spicy chicken which I paid extra for! It was disgusting and disappointing. I paid $20+ for that? Not worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie,2.28,2.39,2.832,,2.346

And the cheesecake at the end is a treat well worth waiting for and the end of a big meal.    Well again, another review I should have posted before. So please forgive me on that behalf. I visit here & other Cheesecake Factory locations when I can. Just because I know that I will always be satisfied with the service as well for the meals.    On this particular visit. I found myself venturing in to new taste. Such as the soup. I usually choose to have a salad before the main course. But this time I did the opposite, and went for their soup. And let me tel you, that must have been one of the best restaurant soups I have ever had in quite sometime. So FYI, don't pass up the soup if it's offered. You will not be disappointed.    Please forgive me on forgetting the names of the entrées. But I'm sure if you show the waitress or waiter the will know what it is.    My pasta with chicken was delicious. My wife's salad with fish was the same. We enjoyed them so much that we tried to hold back as much as possible so we would be able to take them home to have for the next day : )   So if you are reading this review to try and make a decision on where it is that you and a family member or friend would like to dine. Do not over look this place. The variety of different options they offer is great. And on top of that, let's not forget about the cheesecake. It is one of those delights you find yourself cheating on your diet for ; ) I know I do.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie,2.48,2.44,2.832,,2.456

We ordered to-go: -bread and butter.  Received no butter. -A tossed green salad with extra ranch.  No idea what dressing we got but sure wasn't ranch. -Pasta da Vinci.  They brag that this is their most liked chicken dish or something.  It was disgusting.  I had to add salt (which I never do) for it to taste like ANYTHING and even that was a bad move because all it did was bring out the horrible taste.  The pasta obviously tasted like the water it was cooked in and it tasted like the worst tap water you've ever had.  Then, each and every piece of chicken I bit into had some nasty cartilage or something hard in it and I had to spit it out.  I'm weird about meat so it took all I had in me not to throw up on my plate.   -2 Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp.  We've gotten this before and it's never had chicken in it.  Today there was chicken.  Probably to cut back on shrimp and save them a buck while charging customers shrimp prices. -Celebration Cheesecake.  Haven't tried this yet as I lost my appetite from dinner.

I ordered a passion fruit mojito and it was surprisingly delicious . For two entrees (which are really big portions), a drink, and a soda pop- the bill was around $50.

We were celebrating our family member's birthday and Cheesecake happens to be her fav restaurant. So when we asked where she like to go...we knew her choice. For a change the experience this time was very welcoming and warm. Our waiter was charming, informative and helpful and that changed everything. The food tasted more delicious and the place more familiar.  The Filet Mignon simply melted in mouth.My sister's Jambalaya and my husbands steak with teriyaki were outstanding too. Just the pineapple chicken was a let down, as it is just like orange chciken with few pineapple bits in there. The cocktail were great and since my sister's came in a chipped glass, the waiter happily got her another one. We were impressed by their option of low carb, no sugar cheesecake option! We have a suggestion to make, hopefully someone insider is listening. My son and i know many kids are allergic to eggs. So if your master cheff can work on a Eggless cheesecake option...you will see us much more often.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie,2.96,2.43,2.832,,2.6420000000000003
