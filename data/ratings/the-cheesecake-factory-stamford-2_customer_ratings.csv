And there were lots of empty tables the whole time. Both the menu & the table had hair. (Just gross) The food took ridiculously long. We didn't get our food until an hour later? Had to go to the register just to get the waitress to take our card so we could leave. That still took her another 10 minutes to figure it out. (With at least 4 people helping her at one point.) There were staff just hanging out/ crowding en masse. There were only 2 stalls in the bathroom for that many patrons?

19,Grisha B.,"Stamford, CT",0,4,,4.0,2016-10-24,I was so happy to see cheesecake open in Stamford. The staff was friendly. Our food took alittle long to come out. The staff was friendly about the mess my little guy was making. I agree with the bathrooms only two stalls bit enough for the Stamford crowds. We had lunch in the  afternoon so it wasn't so crowded and still somethings were delayed. The bread wasn't warm and little stale.

I always made the trip to the White Plains location, and was hoping the service would be better in Stamford.. Yet they are new, and I have the utmost confidence that they will figure it out. The managers actually reached out to me, and wanted to make things right! To me that says a lot!

61,Mellisa B.,"Summit, NJ",0,5,,2.0,2016-10-27,"Not too impressed. I did not dine in, as I didn't want to deal with the wait- it was only their second day open so of course they were going to be busy. Not a problem- they offer curbside pick up! My first issue was with their lack of organization- other valet attendants at the Stamford town center told us we could not wait at the designated curbside pick up area because we were blocking the other valet areas- which we were not. Curbside was not ready once we arrived after our 45 minute wait. There was much confusion over who was actually retrieving our order. After waiting ten minutes, we finally got our food. Unfortunately, the food was not that good. Regular pasta with just plain tomato basil sauce and some mozzarella. The pasta and chicken were obviously not cooked in the sauce- making it flavorless. The mozzarella was low quality and not fully melted. The basil didn't taste fresh either. For the price, the food sucked. I would DEFINITELY choose their location in White Plains over this one in Stamford. Both their kitchen and FOH staff seem to have some work to do.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-stamford-2?start=80,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44

Initially skeptical about what to expect because I've heard varying reviews from friends and family.   We arrived at around 2:50pm and were greeted at the door by a friendly hostess and sat within two seconds at a booth for four.  We were then greeted right away by the server. The Mac and Cheese balls are the best at Cheesecake and we also tried the Tex Mex Eggrolls which were delicious. This time around for my entree I tried the Teriyaki Chicken. The chicken was really moist and flavorful and the pineapple and banana complimented it really well.

Then she proceeded to come back 10 minutes later and tell us that they couldn't be made cause they didn't have milk. I work as a server as well, I'm pretty sure the bartender was just feeling too lazy and didn't want to make them as she was closing. Oh well.

However excluding one in Maryland this establishment has had the worst service. My party of eight called ahead to make a reservation and the person who took our call said that they did not take reservations. Fun fact: Cheesecake Factories only do not take reservations on Weekends. I did not know that Thursday was part of the weekend.  I digress, we called several times after that and our call was either ended midway or the staff failed to pick up the phone. We spoke to the manager who obligingly provided us with seats (How gracious!) However once we had ordered the manager came around again and told us that we had to either break up our party or wait half an hour for a table we could stay at.

103,Katherine P.,"Stamford, CT",138,993,941.0,3.0,2016-12-05,"So, I wanted to show Lee the pinnacle of American Chain excess. A place where you get OK food, in ginormous quantities. He had never been to a Cheesecake Factory, so I suggested that now that this location has been open for a couple of months, they probably have their opening wrinkles ironed out. So. Friday night, quoted an hour wait. We don't mind, so we hung out and waited. We were seated after about 40 minutes, so that was a nice surprise. I was not expecting there to be much special beer wise, but I was actually surprised to find that they had 2 microbrew selections, one of which is from Stamford's local brewery, Half Full.  The server was super new and really seemed to be under stress with such a busy night, but she got our drink orders out promptly. She was suddenly replaced after that, which was a little unusual, but no matter. Lee wanted to try an appetizer, and I let him pick the buffalo blasts. This is the point where the quantity vs quality starts. These are basically deep fried chicken wing dip, encased in wonton wrappers. They weren't BAD, but there was enough on the plate for about 4-6 people.  I really wish they would allow half orders of things like this. I went for the Steak Diane and salmon combo, and Lee got the ribeye. These dishes are probably some of the best choices on the menu if you don't want to overeat. They were both cooked well, their medium is more like medium rare, and my rare was nicely rare. By this time we were rather stuffed, so we split a key lime cheesecake piece, because you can't really come here without having cheesecake. I probably wouldn't come back for dinner, not because it is bad -- it is what it is, and the service was efficient and pleasant. This place is a food factory, and it is definitely not a place you are going to be surprised by. It is going to be the same experience, whether you eat here, or in San Francisco, or Virginia, or any other place.

So excited to order my favorite steak on the menu but somehow this place has different one. I asked for medium well but instead they gave burnt steak that was cooked like well done but extremely well done like it was so dry. Also the portion of the meat was so small that I thought I ordered something else. Aren't all the cheesecake factory menu/style the same? Or they vary by the location? My mom and sister ordered something else but I remember they were very blend in flavor (we didnt even take the leftovers) and so freaking salty that i had to refill my drink three times.

76,C F.,"New Haven, CT",0,10,,1.0,2016-12-14,"I went to the Cheesecake factory last night 12-13-16 to give it a shot. Since it was a Tuesday, there wouldn't be a huge crowd and since they have been in business for a while I figured they would have everything ironed out.  I arrived there and the atmosphere was extremely nice. I get seated by an extremely nice hostess. At that point, is where the positive ended. I sit down and immediately the waiter comes to the table while my fiancé and I are still taking off our jackets and asked us what we wanted to drink and order. I told the waiter we haven't even sat down, but ordered two waters and a drink. A different person brings the drinks back (1 water and 1 drink). No big deal to me. Approximately 30 minutes later, the waiter comes back and asks us what we want to order. Well the male literally put his face next to my face, it wasn't even that loud but maybe he had hearing problems.. I get it.  Next our appetizer came out, The Spinach dip with artichokes. I would assume the food runner brought that food out quickly which he hit the drink and almost knocked it off and then walked away without saying a word. The food was barely warm which it was supposed to be hot. We waited about 5-10 minutes thinking our waiter would come back and ask how everything was. He didn't come back so my fiancé and I figured we would just eat some of it. The app was also bland but it wasn't too bad. Maybe it if it was hot, it would be better. After that our dinners came out, a Shrimp with Pasta dish and Salmon. Again, a food runner brought the food (my waiter still hasn't come). They gave me a piece of lemon but I would have liked another one for the Salmon. Problem is, still no waiter after 5-10 minutes. As well, they served tartar sauce with Salmon. I honestly have never seen that which was different. I finally just asked the waitress for the table next to me for some lemon. The waitress goes, ""Have you seen your waiter at all recently?"" I replied, No. I thought maybe that message would get to him, but it didn't. Regardless, I never got another piece of lemon. I tried the lemon and the broccoli. I ordered the Salmon Med-Rare which was over-cooked but the broccoli was good and so were the potatoes (if you like barely warm potatoes).  My fiancé dish with shrimp tasted actually really good. Her only knock was they gave 4 small shrimp on a huge pasta dish. But if it tasted good, I was looking for some positive to get out of there.  Now that she ate her dish and I ate about 5 bites of mine, I told myself well at least I saved room for desert. Well after 20 minutes of her dish being pretty much empty, and I haven't eaten no waiter still. I again asked the waitress for the next table if she could rap the dinner which she agreed and apologized for the waiter we had. I asked her for the desert menu which she came back with. Now with our food bagged up, the waiter FINALLY shows back up. He asked, ""What can I get you for desert?"" Not how was everything, sorry for not being here for the entire course or anything of that manner. At that point, I just said I will take the check. I have been a waiter for over 10 years of my life so I know the business. I understand we get busy although they really weren't that busy. But that was probably one of the worst servers, if not the worst, I have ever had. Maybe he was new I don't know. But I can assure you, I will never go to that restaurant again. I have told everyone I know the same thing and people were looking forward to trying it but they all pulled back.  I wish this restaurant the best of luck but I think the only thing that may keep it alive for the first go-around is the name of the restaurant being so popular. Once people try the food and see the service, unless the other waiters/waitresses are better, they will be another closed business in Stamford. On 12-15-16, they asked me to send this review to their corporate office which I proceeded to do shortly after. As of this writing on 12-22-16, I still have not had a response back.

They forgot the sweet potato fries and charged us for it. Anyways, this was my second time trying out the Stamford location. I am not impressed. I believe this could be a really good place if they speed up the cooking time and actually take a minute to give a sh** about the customers food that is sitting in the window.

I PERSONALLY called in for lunch and ordered a small soup- they told me it would be 15 minutes (because it apparently takes that long to put it into a cup) and when I got there I waited another 40 minutes for soup I could've gotten at CVS and microwaved myself.

24,Toya F.,"Norwalk, CT",16,2,,1.0,2016-12-27,"I was totally disappointed by the service and the lack of empathy from both server and management Sever( Ashley and Managers Andrew and Jen). First let me start off by saying that it was my daughters 16th birthday and decided to spend it there knowing the service and the food were awesome at the Trumbull location. Asheley started off as our sever then it switched over to another server ( who was amazing) because she went on break. Now let me just say that I have been in the food and beverage industry for over 20 years.  I started off as a server and got promoted to management.  OUr food was bland and under cooked and when I complained about it Ashley went and got the manager Andrew who just came to the table and said would you like another side, he did not even apologize.  I wanted 20 minutes for my mac and cheese side to arrive so it ruined my bland fish tacos. My daughters pasta had 2 peices of chicken and pasta was beyond al'dente.  Here is what really ruined our experience.  I previously bought a cake from them on Friday ( Chocolate Godiva Cheesecake) on Thursday because our original plan was to go to Hibachi. I should of kept my original plans. I asked Ashley if they can cut the cake for us, she came back with the cake uncut and said that the manager Jen said there is no one here to cut the cake and there would be a cake cutting fee. I could not believe that there was no one there to cut my daughters cake but they were going to charge me a cake cutting fee. Does this make any sense? So Jen comes over and says with an attitude is there a problem, I said not I will cut the cake myself. I did not want to start any drama and did not want to get loud because my daughter was already upset and did not want to make the situation worse. They didn't even bring us a knife to cut our cake.  I spend $30 on that cake and they told me they were going to charge me a fee but there was no one there to cut the cake. So if i was to pay the cake ;cutting fee, who was going to cut the cake? Makes no sense. I will never go back and i will take this complaint further. I am not done with this, my daughter left crying and her birthday was ruined. Ashley had the never to come over and say I was going to cut the cake for you after we were done eating our cake. Extremely upset. A little advice for the server if your table is upset you need not to ask me if i want to speak to a manager. It is your job to make sure that your table leaves happy. You are suppose to go to your manager and make it right before we head out the door. I can not believe out of all the bull shit about you guys having the best servers and only hire the best! Wh;y would I want to speak to a manager when they both had no care in the world to make things right.

51,Jac D.,"Norwalk, CT",50,9,,2.0,2016-12-27,"What an eventful evening. I thought to take my girlfriend here to celebrate her birthday. To start the night out they said it would take 20-30 minutes for a table. Which is totally understandable. We waited a good 30 minutes or more. But once we started seeing people that came after us get seated I figured to ask what was going on. They told us they paged us a long time ago. Which in fact i promise you it did not buzz. I didn't eat much the whole day cause I was excited to try one of everything (yes I'm exaggerating). So with an appetite I held that pager and stared at it to the point I didn't blink and I had crazy dry eyes! But yet there was no apology on their behalf and they put the blame on us. Thankfully they put us to the next seat available. In my head I'm thinking this is just the beginning to a badddd night. But we were still hopeful. They offered us two different types of tasty but stale bread to hold us over which triggered my TMJ. As an appetizer we ordered the factory nachos. Surprisingly it was good. Big enough to have been our meals. I ordered a Philly cheese steak with fries. And she ordered the grilled chicken and avacodo with fries. Both sandwiches are exceptional, but you can get it at your nearest Italian spot for half the price. The fries were cold. And tasted like the fries from Wendy's. And to top it off my girlfriends birthday cheesecake had a piece of cardboard in it. The manager apologized and took both of our desserts off the receipt. And sent her with one to go home with.

35,Jacob P.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,67,3.0,1.0,2017-01-16,"At this Cheesecake Factory, we were treated with disrespect and horrible service.  The disrespect and service from the waiter (whose name is SOPHY) was so bad, that I was unable to finish my dinner because I was made to feel uncomfortable eating in an establishment that I was paying for a descent meal. This place has succeeded to be the worse place that I've ever eaten.  I will explain exactly what type of service my colleague and I received here during our visit. A colleague and I decided to try this place after a business conference.  He's never been to The Cheesecake Factory before and he really wanted to give it a shot; so I agreed that we'd have dinner at this restaurant.  From the time we arrived to the moment we were out the door, we were given the worst service that I've ever experienced; and to make it worse, it was intentional by our waiter. We were called up to the front to be seated by the buzzing of the handheld pager.  As we arrived up front, there was an issue with the seating arrangements.  The host kept us waiting around the front seating area for several more minutes to find a table, and then asked if it was okay if we sit in the high chair tables near the bar.  After waiting so long after being paged, we agreed to sit at the high tables.  After being escorted to the table, it was filthy with crumbs.  We stood there and waited at the table for several more minutes for someone to clean up the table.  Finally, a guy arrived and wiped down the table. After being seated, my friend decided to order a beer.  The menu had no beer prices, he was curious as to the price of a Miller Lite.  When the waiter whose name is SOPHY came to our table, we asked her for the price of the beer.  She immediately gave us an attitude saying ""I don't know"" and then grunted.  She refused to give us a price then proceeded to say ""Just order something, ugh, I give up"" and walked off without taking our order.  This was the beginning of a bad experience. After she walked off, she returned several minutes later and my colleague asked her again for the price.  The response he received was a cold stare with her facial expression half cocked. Without getting an answer to his question, he opted for a water.  I decided to get a lemonade and then she made a snarky comment, ""Oh finally, someone is getting a drink.""  At this time, we ordered our food. After waiting a while, the bread and beverages arrive at the table but with no utensils.  We tried to wave down our waiter SOPHY again but we were ignored.  We waited for several more minutes and tried to capture her attention each time she walked past our table but still we were ignored. We started eating the bread and butter with our fingers and ended up asking another waiter for utensils. About 40 minutes pass by and we were near starving.  I was wondering what was taking so long, so the waiter saw me glancing at her and came over and said, ""Let me check on your food.""  After several more minutes pass by, she came to our table and she that she forgot to check to see if our dishes were ready.  At this time, I realize that we were intentionally getting bad service.  The waiter kept running around and went no one near the kitchen, she saw me glance over again and she gave me a rude hand gesture to wait. Shortly after, our dishes arrived and she commented that ""Hope, you didn't wait too long"" in an extremely sarcastic way. She ignored our table for the remainder of the meal and we never received any refills or checkups.  Finally, she stops by and my colleague ordered some cheesecake.  A few moments later, the cheesecake came back in a to-go bag along with our check.  I was only half way done eating and we were already getting a check?  I knew we were not welcome here and I no longer felt comfortable in this establishment.  I was begging to just checkout and leave.  I asked to get a to-go bag so I could finish my meal at home, and I also requested a slice of Dutch Apple Caramel Strudel.  The waiter got really upset and crumbled the receipt in her hand and left.  She returned and said, ""We're out of the Dutch Apple Caramel.""  I didn't want any other kind of dessert so she took the books with our credit cards.  I stopped her and asked her for a receipt because she crumbled up the last receipt in her hands.   She then said, I can't give you a receipt until after I charge it.  It felt shady to me but I agreed to go ahead and run my credit card without getting the price.  She returned with the bill and slapped the ink pen on the table with attitude and never bought back the to-go container.  I had to ask again to bring a to-go bag and she got really upset.  After she returned, I packed my food and was going to walk out but I felt this needed managerial attention on how the waiter treated us a patrons. I explained all this to the manager and he said he will address the situation.  The manager apologized and offered the same Dutch Apple Caramel that the waiter said was out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-stamford-2?start=20,2.56,2.56,2.56,1.988,2.56

Every time I have been with my husband and my two kids (4 years and 1 year) - and they are incredibly well behaved, thank God... because this place has kept us waiting on various occasions.  First time- server never puts order in. By the time they realize it, they tried to cover it up and say that because I ordered my cheeseburger well-done it was holding up the order. I used to be a server, I know all the lies, and that one is bulls**t. Don't blame the customer for your screw up. You know how I know it was a lie? Because when I got the burger it was completely RAW inside. I almost threw up. I'm so mad writing this I don't even want to keep going... but I will. They apologized and didn't charge us for the burger, but at that point the whole experience was ruined.  Second time - Same thing! Can you believe it? Literally, the exact same thing happened. I ordered a sandwich (don't remember which one) and it never came. It just never came. On top of it, we ordered an appetizer and the server kept coming back saying they were out of ____. That happened 4 times. 4 times they were out of everything we ordered! Seriously? I would chalk it up to the fact that they were a new restaurant, but it had been open for a few months at this point.

I recommend management train both chefs and waiters better so we all can have a more pleasant experience. A few months went by and I did come back again based on the management response to my original feedback. They did not change much: I order an avocado toast without onion (allergy); they took it back and said they would make a fresh new one. I was surprise to see the very same toast all messy with some few pieces of onions coming back to my table.

The orange chicken is not worth getting. Doesn't taste right and doesn't sit well.  The Cheesecake obviously is amazing. Adam's Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple Cheesecake is amazing.

I thought about it because maybe you'd send me a coupon for free food or something but honestly just don't think it's worth it. Everything about your restaurant from the lack of prices, managers pulling bartenders away from their patrons, websites demanding personal information- indicates you think that diners have no other choices. Way too much work to get a piece of cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-stamford-2,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4

102,Erika D.,"Stamford, CT",3,21,8.0,3.0,2017-10-27,Went here for happy hour last night.  The bartender was great and super great service and our happy hour food was great. However the three stars goes for takeout...Ordered a bbq ranch chicken salad to go but with crispy chicken. When i got it i saw that it was grilled chicken and the bartender did a great job running to get me the crispy chicken. However when i got home i realized takeout didnt pack any dressing and the dressing is why i wanted the salad in the first place....,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-stamford-2,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64

Not sure why such a low rating on yelp... for the price of each entree...Its well worth the praise. We ordered "" fish tacos, with battered cod"" comes with cilantro rice and beans,"" sweet and sour chicken and shrimp over brown rice"", and ""bacon burgers with mashes potatos"".

85,Savannah T.,"Southampton, MA",65,7,,3.0,2017-11-16,"THIS was my first time visiting a Cheesecake Factory restaurant! First and foremost, outlet server Najera was wonderful! Charismatic and attentive, her service was wonderful! Beverages: I ordered the Raspberry lemonade and found it INCREDIBLY sugary! I didn't hate it, but I also couldn't finish it. Food: we ordered the fried zucchini appetizer, that was delish!!! I also ordered the lemon garlic shrimp, this too was very yummy. My issues with my dinner were needing to take the tails off the shrimp myself, not a huge issue but a little difficult doing that with a fork and knife while the shrimp slide around in the sauce! Also, one of the shrimp seemed to still be encased in its ""shell"" of sorts, having to pick bits of the shell/exoskeleton whatever it is, out of my mouth was just not okay. My father ordered the Mexican tortilla salad and had an issue with the severe lack of chicken in the salad, it was ordered from the ""skinny"" menu so maybe that's why the chicken was difficult to find, I'm not sure! I did bring the shell on the shrimp up to Najera and she apologized and said she would mention this to the cooks. Overall this was an okay experience, service like Najera's is what would bring me back to try the experience again despite some minor issues with the food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-stamford-2,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
90,Ann P.,"Greenwich, CT",2,54,58.0,1.0,2017-11-18,"Oh man!  Not what I remember at all.  I used to LOVE the Bistro Shrimp pasta - the lemon, garlic, touch of cream...  (it was worth the hour long wait!).  Now it is not so lemony, not so garlicky, but still creamy, with a touch of red pepper flakes (not in the description of the dish) and worst of all it must have been cooked and sat in the window for awhile the pasta absorbed all of the liquid and was just thick.  Service is very slow. Why were we here?  Came for my son's birthday and he, the pizza connoisseur, ordered the pizza.  He said 'meh, pizza at CPK much better'.  He didn't even like the chocolate milk.  The best part for all of us was the table bread with butter. I don't think I will ever come back here again.  Ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-stamford-2,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
88,Carol D.,"Stamford, CT",0,6,,1.0,2017-11-22,"""An uninvited guest""  On Wednesday, 11/22/17, my husband and I decided to grab a bite to eat prior to hosting Thanksgiving.  We were promptly seated and our server was attentive. We put in our order, received our drinks and bread and as we were sitting in our booth out crawls a roach on the back of the booth next to me... So we called over our server and she tried to catch it... She said she would move our table... We said no thanks and left.   For goodness sakes hire an exterminator.   My husband and I had an early dinner here yesterday, 11/9 at 4:00 pm, with another couple.  The restaurant was fairly empty at this time and now I know why.... We shared the Nacho appetizer, it would have been good but the chips were so over salted that three quarters of the appetizer sat uneaten.  I had the Bang Bang Shrimp entree which was much too salty, thank god for the rice which helped cut the salt.  My husband had a Classic Burger(no cheese) which he said was not very good and he may have eaten only three or four fries and has had an upset stomach since.   Our dining companions had the Salmon Special and the Shrimp & Chicken Gumbo which they also commented that their entrees would have been much more enjoyable if they were not over salted.

94,Kaye V.,"Norwalk, CT",1,20,,2.0,2017-11-23,"Months go by, and this location improves only marginally. On my last takeout order, I was told 15 minutes but it took 30 minutes and, once again, getting bread is something you must request on a takeout order (plus, after years of ordering white chicken chili, I had never seen it prepared with so much spice and so many beans). My last sitdown experience was yesterday -- 6 minutes before we were greeted by a waiter, and 14 minutes before we received water/tea. The good news is that our meals arrived 21 minutes after the order was placed -- that's record time for this location. Still, there was no bread (still baking, we were told). My hope is that at some point, the apologies will stop and someone will come in to manage this location well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-stamford-2,2.72,2.61,2.61,,2.654
87,Mary K.,"Darien, CT",0,8,,1.0,2017-12-01,"My sisters and I had dinner at The Cheesecake Factory about two weeks ago.  I had never eaten there and was pleasantly surprised.  So I decided to try their takeout.  I ordered a half a roasted chicken to go last night. When I got home and open the dish there were plenty of mashed potatoes and carrots. The chicken part of the dish consisted of a wing, a leg, and two small thighs.  Needless to say I was very disappointed-enough so that I called today to tell the manager. She said she would take care of it by refunding the cost of the dish.  She asked me to hold on while she went to her computer.  When she came back on the line she said her co-worker said the menu didn't specify that I would get a breast. So in the world of the Cheesecake Factory half a chicken doesn't mean what it does in the real world.  If they were going to have any chance of me believing that I should have received two legs and two thighs.  The bottom half of the chicken. When I replied, ""you must be joking?"" The manager said she'd call me tomorrow.  Let's see if they come to their senses.  If they don't then we aren't having our company holiday party there and I won't be going there anytime soon. I suggest that you don't either. Update-  Two days later and still no callback.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-stamford-2,2.56,2.57,2.57,,2.566

That said, this review is strictly about the food. The people working here were all great and super nice. But oh sweet pepper Jones I don't even know what to say about the stuff I ate here.

Floor manager grabs them and brings them back and promises them they will be sitting quickly. Within 5min they have a table!!!! I complain to manager but get the usual BS and promise to work some magic? What was he planing to kick people out table and sit us down? Another 15min finally sitting down.
