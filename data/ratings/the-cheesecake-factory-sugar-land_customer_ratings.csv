258,Oanh L.,"Richmond, TX",28,185,247.0,4.0,2012-01-04,"I love shopping & I love the fact that there's one of these located at most malls. My mother and I usually go shopping every Friday and have lunch. Our favorite place to eat is The Cheesecake Factory. We love eating here for a few various reason... 1.) The customer service. No matter how much we order or how little we eat, we always get the same customer service from various waiter/waitress. 2.) The patio seating is awesome! Whenever weather permits, my mother & I enjoy our lunch outside. It's a lot colder inside than outside during Spring or Fall season; patio dinning is the better choice. 3.) The interior design is simply gorgeous! It has an Egyptian look. The pillars, color, and seating nicely play together. 4.) THE FOOD! Some very delicious dishes...and the portion is huge!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sugar-land?start=260,2.8,2.8,2.8,2.7359999999999998,2.8
265,David S.,"Rio Grande City, TX",47,62,17.0,5.0,2012-01-05,"Hmmm. Wow!!!! Reece's peanut butter cheesecake.... Who are some of these people? Are they from outer space? Really? Are we giving the Cheescake Factory three stars or less? Wow!  This location is probably one of the nicest locations. Located in one of the nicest areas in SugarLand, I found this location to be classy. I always enjoy the valet service at The Chesscake Factory. No charge as long as you eat or buy from the Cheesecake Factory. You know, you can eat at the Cheescake Factory (CF). The CF does not only sell cheesecake. But, where can I begin, we had the Peanut Butter and choclate cheese cake. Wow! That was a little too much sweetness, but I could not stop eating it! I, did, however, have to eat it in small doses, but that was my fault.  I wish I would have bought a few slices home with me as I was visiting my sister in Houston.  Note to other YELPERS! If you are going to give a negative review, please tell us why. I can not undertsand why someone rates a business 2 or three stars and writes ""Good food and atmosphere!""

293,James L.,"Sugar Land, TX",5,15,4.0,1.0,2012-01-07,"Terrible service at the Cheese Cake in Sugarland. We sat for 10-15 minutes, was never greeted by a server and had to wave one down for water and bread. The server never checked up.  Food was terrible, over spiced and seasoned. This is very unusual for CC, we've always had good food and great service at the Houston, San Francisco, and San Mateo locations. Anyone considering Cheese Cake in Sugarland should just go to Denny's - better service and comparable food quality. -JL",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sugar-land?start=280,2.76,2.76,2.76,2.212,2.76
212,NowIamaMrs. B.,"Houston, TX",1,22,14.0,1.0,2012-02-12,"Very dissapointed at my visit to this location tonight. Came for a girlfriend's birthday dinner and  that had to have been the WORST wait, food, and service every recieved from The Cheesecake factory. Scenerio My friend arrived at 7 to reserve a table for 20-30 people if possible to be available by 8pm. Apparently she was told it would be a 2 1/2 hour wait. She waited since she really loved the restaraunt and had already made plans to have her dinner at this location. While waiting for service the front door staff ""greeters"" stared at us as if we were at the wrong place? VERY WEIRD. Anyway after waiting and waiting we were seated at 10:30. Keep in mind there were other large parties coming in that were being seated ahead of us, even though we were there prior to their arrival. You would say maybe they booked there reservation earlier, but that is just the thing, we were told reservations were not avilable, and that tables were reserved on a first come, first serve basis...interesting. Finally Seated We were greated by a server named Robert, whom may i express was WONDERFUL. He was very apologetic, accomodating, and attentative to our table. He introduced himself as well as another server named Adam. Adam did not introduce himself. Robert did it for him.Throughout the night orders, once received were unappetizing. Noodles were dry for the Fettucini, the rice was cold for the gumbo, and more sauce was needed for the basil pasta. The only good thing was the Chocolate Martini. Robert made sure to take care of orders that came back incorrect and did everything needed to accomodate us. Adam on the other hand....where was he again? Bill Arrived Of course gratuity was included in the bill. In one situation my sister ordered the angel hair pasta with shrimp. The menu said the order was 16.95. When the bill arrived it was priced at 20.45.We asked why was it priced like this and we were told that was ""just"" how it rung up. I advised unless it was on the menu for that price there would have to be a better way to justify this amount. Needles to say it was miracously corrected. We mentioned the fact we had been waiting over 3 hours for a table and was quickly told by Adam, ""You were told there was a 2 1/2 hour wait anyway"". Seriously? That is the attitude receieved after poor unapologetic service. Great. Final Call Had it been my event I wouldn't have gave Cheesecake factory a dime of my money. I do not like unappreciative service. I asked how were the tips split between the 2 waiters and spoke with a manager Mike that myself and a few others wanted our already included tip to go to Robert. A few people did not tip at all regardless of the tip being included because the service was just that BAD. The manager came out and gave an apology statement but from all the feedbackwe recieved from the manager as to ""What the manager said"" I doubt it was genuine. Needless to say I WILL NOT BE BACK. I choose Mark's over them anyday. It was a waste of money and downright rude rude rude service from the beginning to the end. Our thin grace of light was Robert and I thank him for doing what he could by himself.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sugar-land?start=220,2.76,2.76,2.76,2.2760000000000002,2.76

Friend had the spicy crispy beef...definitely a big portion but you're paying  like $16 for it...sharable indeed.  Tastes like any orange beef to me but still good if you're wanting a Chinese dish. For dessert we had the tiramisu cheesecake.  I typically don't like tiramisu but this tasted pretty good.  I so enjoy their brown bread there...I was asking for seconds!  What is your secret!?!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sugar-land?start=240,2.72,2.72,2.72,2.572,2.72

The English muffin came out burnt and soggy. I asked the waiter to exchange for a new one for me. He came back out with another less burnt piece. I didn't want to cause any trouble for him, because I am pretty sure the kitchen did a crap job. I didn't say anything but in my mind a siren went off to not go there for brunch ever again.  Their cheesecake is the only reason I would even think about going there. My favorite is the tiramisu cheesecake. I hate the feeling of being bloated after eating fattening food. This cheesecake made me feel satisfied and not bloated at all.  I guess they named it cheesecake factory for a reason. Go for the cheesecake, not their food.

I knew from previous food experiences order small!  I got the little greek salad- oh man- delicious- I wish they could pull off a greek dressing rather than vinagrette but to their credit they described it on the menu.  I had the wild mushroom flatbread pizza- it was pretty good- and in the end I wasn't stuffed and could have dessert.  Waiter was same as last time we were in for just dessert- nice guy.  My big hint we came at about....1130 AM on a sunday which I thought would mean a line and us leaving like usual- no line- 1/2 empty but it was pouring out- note to self on that- I usually don't eat here because of the wait- the food just isn't that good to be waiting for.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sugar-land?start=180,2.68,2.68,2.68,2.572,2.68
259,Nick R.,"Fresno, TX",10,129,3.0,2.0,2012-04-26,"We are here last week - not very good. We ate a late lunch, we had bang bang chicken (lol-title might not be totally correct but close enough) and my other half had shrimp gumbo. Also, had Tiramisu cake - which was the best part of the meal. Oh yea, had something called berry icicle - something like that, it was good but price has gone-up on that item used to be much cheaper now its $10 and it is not a big glass considering 1/3 of it is whip cream. Overall this was not a good experience, the food tasted bland and way to sweet. The service was ok, not bad just a bit of drama going on with wait staff. The location (Sugarland) was not busy at all. We have been to this location before but for some reason it tasted better last time.

266,Veronyka G.,"Sugar Land, TX",49,24,1.0,1.0,2012-05-15,"The Cheesecake Factory normally has outstanding service at lunch, dinner, and late in the evening so it should follow that brunch would be excellent on Mother's Day.  After we were promptly seated, it took a while to get our waiter's attention. We placed out order and received our drinks. The milk was not cold. When we spoke to the manager, he told us that the milk is kept in the refrigerator by the cheesecake so we should be getting it fresh from the fridge cold. That didn't happen.  My orange juice, although freshly squeezed, wasn't very cold either. I didn't say anything about that because at least it wasn't hot.  Our food arrived about thirty minutes later and we weren't impressed. There wasn't anything spectacular about the omelette and the pancakes didn't look all that appetizing.  In the end, I was a little disappointed by my brunch. My family would've been better off going to another breakfast place or my cooking breakfast but I will be back.

295,chris c.,"Houston, TX",0,6,,5.0,2012-05-30,"The first colony cheesecake is my favorite restaurant in Houston, I have never been disappointed at this restaurant. It is the perfect balance of everything and is a great value. The food is always perfect or they will take it back and make it perfect with little or no questions. Same with the drinks, if anything is not what you expected they will fix it.  The service here is very good and consistent, although it seems they hire new servers all the time. The aesthetics of the restaurant are pretty decadent in my opinion, it is very well decorated and the lighting is not too dark or too bright. The booths have high walls so even when the place is busy it still feels like you have a good amount of privacy, you don't have to worry about making awkward eye contact with the people at the next booth or having them listen to your conversation.

In attendance were my wife - the vegetarian, my two daughters and myself - the partial carnivores. Servicing the table, Rachel - a slightly confused (read on) but attentive young lady. Beverages - water, unsweet and sweet teas, mimosas for the two daughters, sample sips for the parents. Appetizers - complimentary bread basket with the yummiest bread, fried calamari, which initially confused Rachel till my wife proclaimed that she was the only vegetarian. I had requested Rachel that the calamari be crisp and hot. She made sure it was. Thai lettuce wraps without chicken. Wife mentioned to Rachel that last time they gave us tofu instead. Rachel checked with the kitchen and brought out a plate of warm, delicious tofu in a sauce. This we ate with the wraps. Entrees - belgian waffle with fresh strawberries for my wife, lunch portions of pasta and salmon for the girls. A cuban sandwich and salad for me. There was so much food that we took some pasta, salmon, half the sandwich and the salad home. Dessert - None. You think we're gluttons ;-) Verdict - Excellent service.

After bringing out our cheesecake, he took his sweet time bringing the check. We waited with our plate empty and pushed to the edge of the table for 15min before he finally came to check on us.

They should just make a Cheesecake Factory that serves only cheesecake and coffee/tea/water. They will even bring your cheesecake to your car. After a long day of shopping with the wife, I wanted to treat myself for carry bags and crap all day. So I stopped in midday. My only gripes with this place are that it is terrible expensive and incredibly slow! I didn't even go eat food, I just ordered 3 slices of cheesecake that I could see in the glass. But it still took about 30 minutes. I feel like their ordering system is flawed because they take too many orders upfront and then fill them. Most of the people that were in there when I was, they were only ordering single slices. So to me, it seems like it would make more sense to take the order for say 2 slices, take the 90 seconds to get the cheesecake, give it to them, and then let them go.

I always enjoy the bread that they bring before the meal.  I enjoy the brown bread over the sourdough bread, as did my entire table, and we quickly devoured it.  They brought two baskets for five people, which was good.  Next time I think I'll request double the brown bread and none of the sourdough since the sourdough always goes to waste. I really enjoy their new Skinnylicious menu.  I always try to eat healthy and this makes it extremely easy.  What's even better is that there is a plethora of choices, it is not just a couple.  I got the Seared Tuna Tataki Salad.  I would suggest getting the dressing on the side.  I usually do, but since this was on the Skinnylicious menu I figured they would go light on the dressing.  I was wrong and my salad was left mainly untouched.  The tuna was perfectly seared.  I did not expect it to be that good from the Cheesecake Factory, but it rivaled great sushi places I've been to.   I would also suggest the Reeses Cheesecake.  I get it every time I go to the Cheesecake Factory.  It is big enough to share or eat with your next one or two meals.  If it is just for yourself, get a take out box, because you will definitely be taking some to go.  The fatty inside me always enjoys some of the menu items they think up.  My new favorite is their mac and cheese burger.  They put some of their fried mac and cheese balls on a burger.  My dad had it and thought it was great.  This is definitely something I want to try when I am not eating healthy for a New Years Eve dress.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sugar-land?start=160,2.92,2.92,2.92,2.768,2.92

We decided to just go and crossed our finger in hopes that we won't have to wait too long to be seated. As expected, it was packed. We went up to the desk and told them we'd like a booth for two. We figured if we're going to wait, might as well wait a little longer and get a comfy booth :). She said the wait would be the same (30 minutes) so we were pleased. We managed to find a seat inside. 15 minutes later, our buzzer started vibrating and we were escorted to our booth. The waiter came to us about a minute later for our drink orders. I ended up getting the Georgia Peach. I had never had it before but it sounded delicious so I thought why not. It tasted good (VERY sweet though)..but I'm pretty sure there was little to no alcohol in it.  For an appetizer we went for the made-to-order guacamole. It was absolutely delicious! I'm not a big guac person but decided to get this on a whim. The hubby loves guacamole so naturally he went with the plan. The only downside to this is that the chips to guacamole ratio is not as even as I'd like. We had over half the bowl of guacamole left over when we were done with the chips and we were def piling on the guacamole, lol. Hubby made a good point though - you'd rather run out of chips than guac, right? Anyways. For our entrees I got the spicy cashew chicken and he got the fish and chips. We both loved our meals and took about half of it back home. The servings are HUGE.  The dessert menu is plentiful so we had a hard time deciding on this one. We went with the red velvet cheesecake because we both love red velvet. Unfortunately, this was a bad choice. The cheesecake overpowered the red velvet and it felt so heavy. The cake itself was very rich and we didn't enjoy it very much. We both ate like 1/4 of it and decided we were done with it. Overall, as far as service goes, it was pretty good. Food is great as well and I'd say it's worth the price. This restaurant is more on the pricey-end so we usually just come here for special occasions. I wouldn't make this a daily thing unless you're making the big bucks ;) PS: after 4pm they have ""happy hour"" where drinks & selected appetizers are half price off.

296,Colby H.,"Richmond, TX",30,14,38.0,2.0,2013-01-12,"The food is pretty good - My wife and I are pretty predictable here usually getting the same dish each time. I get the crispy chicken costoletta and it comes with asparagus and mashed potatoes. The chicken is cut in in 3 thinly sliced battered and it sits on some sort of a lemon butter sauce that is so good! For the first time last week I asked for an extra bowl of the sauce and was in heaven dipping the chicken and side in it. My wife gets the salmon and she can't say enough good things about it - I'm not a big fish eater so I can't comment on it personally. We had our boys with us and the younger one isn't eating solid foods yet but for our two year old we always get the kids cheese pizza and it's pretty tasty. Now to talk about the 2 stars I gave, because you are probably scratching your head why I gave them after saying all good things about the food. Plain and simple the service has a lot of room for improvement. First after seating it took forever for a waiter to come by and say hello and get our drink orders (5-10 minutes after sitting down). We both ordered ice tea and we asked for milk for our oldest and we went ahead and told the waiter we wanted to order then. It took about another 5 minutes to get the tea and the extra beer I ordered, which is fine, but they did not bring the milk and that took about another 5-10 minutes to arrive. Luckily they brought the pizza out first but the milk still hadn't arrived which was annoying. When the tea was dropped off they did not have any sugar packets on the table (of any sort) and we had to ask the waiter 2-3 times for them and that is when we could get his attention. I almost got up and went to their waiter station and got one myself.  I can't say I won't go back to the Cheesecake Factory because the food is great but it will probably be the Memorial City or Galleria location because this is not the first time the service here has be sub-par",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sugar-land?start=280,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.504,3.0000000000000004

278,Courtney W.,"Austin, TX",480,400,641.0,1.0,2013-03-28,"This place is so underwhelming it's ridiculous.  The food is bland and over-priced. Sure, the portions are huge, so you could make the argument that it's worth it since you're getting two meals, but who wants to eat a second serving of something that wasn't even good in the first place? No, thank you. I suppose if you live in white, surburban America and you have the tastebuds of a five year old child, you'll probably love Cheesecake Factory. (Not that every five year old child is opposed to food with flavor. Some kids are cool. I'm talking about those five year old kids who will only eat chicken nuggets, refusing to eat anything that doesn't resemble processed junk.) In fact, the only people I know who enjoy the Cheesecake Factory are the people who make the blandest food you've ever tasted and then pat themselves on the back for a job well done. No, your food tastes bad and you should feel bad. The crowning achievement, though, was when my brother and I found broken bits of plate in our jambalaya. My brother and I decided to just share an entree since the portions are so huge, and when everyone's food was brought out, we were informed that our plate had been dropped on the way out and they were getting us fresh food. Okay, no problem, we thought. Then our food arrives and we're eating and I bite down on something hard. What in the world? I pull the offending piece out of my mouth and find it is a piece of plate. What the fuck?? My brother and I then start searching through our food and we keep coming up with bits of plate. Did they scrape our food off the floor and replate it? Why would they serve us food with broken plate bits scattered throughout? The jambalaya wasn't even good enough to salvage the whole experience, either. Jambalaya should have spice and lots of flavor; that jambalaya was the most unremarkable I've ever had. No kick, no spice, nothing.  Their menu is huge, but it's as if they make all these dishes poorly instead of focusing on making a few dishes really well.  Their cheesecake is delicious, which I would hope they can at least get that right, given that they are called The Cheesecake Factory. Overall, though, you'd be better off going to BJ's just right across highway 6. Better food for similar prices and the desserts are pretty yummy, too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sugar-land?start=240,2.8,2.8,2.8,2.6280000000000006,2.8

I went to lunch with my mom and my food was excellent but my mother's plate was not so great. She had chicken fingers and they were salty and stale. The waiter who served us was very nonchalant and rude. I personally felt like she was rushing us to just ""get our food and go!"" She wasn't very attentive either and I felt very uncomfortable while I was there. The manager just so happened to pass by and I called him over to inform him of the rush service and nonchalant attitude of the waiter. He didn't seem to care either way and some how offered us some free cheesecake and insisted we stay as long as we liked. Well the same waiter brought out our cheesecake...in ""to go"" boxes! My mother and I looked at each other like ""ummm....we wanted to stay and eat this here!"" She apologized and said the manager said it was to go. SMH Lack of communication and just plain rude....I told her to bring me the check because I was totally done with this place and it's horrible service. The manager came back over again and apologized, but it was basically like beating a dead horse.

After 3 days of avocados, chicken and spinach in different ways, I decided to get some comfort food.  I got the Meatloaf sandwich which was covered in swiss cheese, caramelized onions, portabella mushrooms, and arugula. The entire sandwich was in between two thick slices of brioche with an aioli spread and served with this amazing tomato-bacon jam. As you can tell from the picture, the sandwich is huge! I didn't eat any breakfast and I still only ate half of it. The meatloaf was really flavorful and I liked the twist on ketchup (the tomato-bacon jam). Having not been to the Cheesecake Factory in years, I only went to have an average lunch, but I was pleasantly surprised.

224,Mariah D.,"Houston, TX",408,483,261.0,4.0,2013-09-13,"My mindset surrounding The Cheesecake Factory is that it's an excellent dessert bar. They serve entrees and food, but for the most part I'll ignore that, and you should too. We went for early dinner on National Cheesecake Day because we wanted half price cheesecake. Saving ourself for cheesecake, we decided to order a few small plates or appetizers off the happy hour menu to share, and our wonderful waiter honored happy hour prices even though we were in the dining area.  The appetizers we ordered were not memorable. The entire menu is just too busy.  When it came to the main event (cheesecake), I couldn't decide between 2 different flavors, and though it was supposed to only be one slice at 50% off per person, our waiter once again fudged the rules a little and let me get 2 slices at half price! I love this waiter. He looked like he was about 19 years old and kept giving this 25 year old little smiles that made me blush. He knew how to get a good tip outta me, thats for sure.  My husband enjoyed the pineapple upside down cheesecake, though I thought it was really gross and way too sweet. I tried the new s'mores cheesecake and it was amazing when it was fresh, but not as good the next day. The mango lime cheesecake was THE BEST. Mango gelee topping, mango and key lime cheesecake on a coconut macaroon crust. This is my go-to cheesecake for the rest of my life.  4 stars because our waiter was superb and because I really don't know of anywhere else in town to get better cheesecake. Certainly nowhere else has such a wide selection.  Oh, and I'll drive to Sugar Land to avoid the Galleria madness. Yep.

I agree...the menu is a bit too long, but the food is tasty. Service is always great, drinks are good (I've had sangria and a cosmo -- both hit the spot), dessert is ohmygoddelicious and the main items are good too. I usually order the tomato, basil and cheese flatbread. The crust is crispy and the toppings intermingle in a pleasant way. There is just enough cheese (not too much, not too little -- it's like a goldilocks portion of cheese), the tomatoes have a nice warmth and sweetness to them that helps cut through the saltiness of the cheese and the basil adds a great herbal quality. Get it the next time you go. The last time I went to TCF, I was with my parents. My mother ordered the chicken enchiladas, which she loved and my father ordered the Cuban sandwich.

I don't live here in Sugar Land so I won't be back very often to evaluate the service. I suppose the most I could do is tell of the atmosphere and how this store compares to the other Cheesecake Factories around the country. Layout: Extremely open. The store is one large, open room. There are not walls separating different dining sections. There are partitions that have the booths attached to them, but not floor to ceiling walls. The booths chairs are connected to the booth behind you, so I could feel the people getting up and moving around as the whole seat moved. Noise: I went on a Monday night, so it wasn't full. The tall ceiling does good to 'take away' the sound that bounces off the hard, tiled floor. The booth directly behind me was occupied but the height of the booth seats did good to keep their conversation away from ours. Overall sound was acceptable, I didn't have to strain to listen to my lovely wife sitting across from me. Food: Good, of course. Service: Poor, we were held hostage for over 10 minutes after we were done eating our cheesecake dessert.

The area was full of dirty tables.  Even the bar itself was covered in dirty dishes and napkins the bartender was finally clearing.  Fifteen minutes later, a bus boy finally cleaned our table & left the tray of dirty dishes in one of our empty chairs, then proceeded to go to the bar and watch the game for a few minutes, before coming back to collect it.  He cleared a few other dirty tables between game breaks, but left others dirty.  Clearly, he wasn't too concerned about his job. Our waiter arrived even later, with bread, but no water, set ups, or bread plates.  I asked for all three.  A good 10 minutes later, maybe more, he showed up again with the items, but by then, we had gotten our own water at the bar.  He took our order, and hubby wasn't sure which salad dressing it was he liked, so the waiter nicely offered to get a sample of the two Asian ones for him to try.  Another ten minutes later, he arrives with the two full boats of dressing and walks off again.  When he comes back another 10 min. later, we find out he hadn't placed our order yet because of the salad dressing question. As we find this out, two tables seated at the same time as we were are already getting their food! Grinding his teeth, hubby snaps for him to turn the order in!  As we sit and try to pretend we are having a good time, another 30 minutes or more passes.  The other two tables get their checks and doggy bags, while I still don't even have my starter salad.  Grrrrrrrrrlllll, goes my stomach and my throat. Meanwhile, we sit amongst even more dirty tables and a manager who comes into the bar area every 5 minutes, not to check on his customers, or even notice we are sitting there still sans food, but to, you guess it, watch the game.  And there's the real problem here.  The help thinks the TV in the bar is there for their entertainment, at the customer's expense.  And why shouldn't they when the manager himself sets such a stellar example?  Attention all restaurant personnel who work in a place with a TV...owners didn't put it there for YOUR entertainment! Every time we see you stop your duties and watch while we sit with empty water glasses, it costs you money and your boss business.  It gets you bad Yelp reviews.  But I digress... I bring our issue to the manager's attention.  He quickly hustles to the kitchen with the waiter in tow.  Several minutes go by, and I stand up to look into the kitchen and see him talking to the line cooks.  Clearly, the food isn't ready.  Who knows why?  Who cares?  Clearly not the staff.  So, this Cheesecake Factory Duchess walked. One hour there and no food folks! This restaurant has good food, but their watered down booze is just too weak to tolerate their awful service.  Like many Sugar Land chains, such as Pappadeaux, I suspect the high turnover is due to the fact they use the burbs as a training ground.  If the waiter or manager is any good they get promoted out of the burbs.   This Duchess is tired of this tedious kingdom, and gladly abdicates her title to the next unfortunate Yelper who wants it.

For the most part the appeal is nostalgic though, because my mom and I have been going there for years and we have had so many good conversations in there over a bottle of Chard. However, my issue was with the cheesecake itself, which is usually the object of praise in reviews of the restaurant. Ok, it wasn't the taste, but....the size! We ordered a piece to go, to take home, and when it arrived, and I looked in the box, it was super small. My mom and I used to share a piece of the same cheesecake for dessert and we would rarely be able to finish it. The manager came over when we remarked to our waiter that it looked rather small compared to what we were used to getting and he said 'they all come in Pre-sliced from corporate'. Ugh!

Well after ordering custom invitations and sending them out within a week, I called with my final head count and they proceed to tell me that they do not take reservations on the weekends.  Why would I order custom invitations if they wouldn't take reservations???? After speaking to a manager that insist that nobody would ever tell me that, he basically said nothing he can do.

I watched tons of waitresses and a manager walk by and no one would even acknowledge us. Talk about in need of training. Pay attention to your clients!!!  Drinks were extremely overpriced especially when I was wondering if there was actually any alcohol in them. For appetizer we had zucchini avocado mushroom fries. They came in a much smaller bowl with less than normal. Also the sauce container is now the size of my thumb. This gives me about enough sauce for one piece of zucchini. I hope they are saving tons of money as they are definitely losing customers. Also the delicious soft sourdough bread was replaced with basically a rock. Can you call this bread? It definitely cut up my boyfriend's mouth. Is this another money saving technique? Terrible bread so we don't ask for seconds. To my boyfriend's disappointment his sandwich also came on this ""bread"". Ridiculous. I ordered chicken and biscuits which online has a picture with white country gravy. Nope.

For the last year my go to had been the key lime cheesecake which is divine if your into that little sour kick.  Anyway, I ordered the red velvet cheesecake because it had been a while and just like an ex sometimes you have to call to see if things have changed. And man they definitely had!!! This was some of the best cheesecake ever. And as I have to always mention I am extremely picky so that says a lot.  It takes talent to pull off red velvet cake but to be able to do it with cheese cake and the red velvet still retain its moisture is like trying to dissect an ant. Very difficult.

One, the menu is extensive. You would expect a place like The Cheesecake Factory to be out of the question for someone on a restricted eating plan, but it really is quite the opposite. They have an entire menu just for calorie-conscious folks. Also, it is the only place in town that makes a mean low carb cheesecake, do that is where I asked my friends to take me for my birthday. Also, it really is a large, pretty restaurant that has booths big enough for six people.  The problem is that it serves so many things to so many people. I have to remind my server of things repeatedly that other servers would provide without question (e.g. coffee refills, bringing the water I asked for when I ordered my meal). I don't blame the waiter; I blame the way the restaurant is set up. It has such an array of options and so many people to serve, I can imagine it would be difficult for any waiter to be detail-oriented. Also, it is so loud that it is hard for me to hear the person at my table directly across from me.

Our server came by our table and without introducing herself or greeting us just asked what we wanted to drink... to which we all replied that we'd just start with water.  The water came in cheap short plastic mugs which was odd because all the tables around us were drinking water out of nice tall glasses... but whatever.  I finished my water quickly and she got me a refill but her hand was placed directly on the lip of the mug... I don't like to drink out of straws so I found this pretty gross.  I would have asked for a different glass but when I looked up she was already gone... I didn't drink again until I got home. When she came back to the table all she said was 'are you ready to order?'  I had originally wanted a beer but after the hand on the glass incident and given the fact that she seemed to be in a rush I just ordered my food... even though my parent's said 'don't you want a beer?' she didn't pick up on it. When we ordered, she didn't write any of it down... spoilers: she got it wrong.  My mom's crab cakes didn't come out with the food.  Now I used to wait tables so I can tell when I'm being lied to and this one was blatant... she said 'they didn't want the crab cakes sitting in the window while you waited for the rest of the food so I'll go get them now.'... it took 10 minutes for them to eventually come out.  I don't mind if you mess up... even if you clearly didn't write the order down... BUT DON'T LIE TO ME! At this point I was pretty irritated. I ordered the enchiladas which were bland and the rice was stale...

If you live in Houston, which my sisters says is hot as hell, you can appreciate how rare it is to have a non humid & 80's temperature in the middle of summer. So we decided to sit outside, which we rarely do during summertime. I requested a table with shade and we got the perfect table. Our waiter came and was very good and prompt during the entire meal. I love love their brunch. In fact, I know this might sound shocking, but Cheesecake Factory has one of the best brunches ever. We always order the freshly squeezed OJ. I love fresh squeeze juice, especially orange juice. Of course I was a pig and ordered two glasses during the duration of our meal. I just wished they sell a carafe of it. If the manager is reading this, please sell the OJ in carafe size. I could drink the whole thing by myself. I ordered the giant Belgian waffle as always. My hubby ordered the brunch combo but substituted the pancakes for waffles. Why? Because their waffles are so freaking yummy!! They literally make the best waffle ever. I have no idea how they do it. It was so flaky on the outside, yet so airy. You know what I am talking about. You know you have ordered waffles that taste like they used the same mixture as pancakes and it comes out so heavy and dense. If you are waffle obsessed like me, you gotta order their Belgian waffle. Ok enuf with the waffle talk. We finished our meal and got the check pretty quickly. An amazing brunch with great companionship and the best weather ever. Can't get better that that.  Cheesecake Factory - oh please sell your OJ in carafe size. And never change your waffle recipe. I come here only to eat your waffles and drink your OJ once a month.

When we finally got called we got seated in the booths. Our table was still dirty but the staff apologized and finished cleaning up. Our waiter came by a few mins later to take our drink order. So for the food we decided on the crab and artichoke dip. My sister got the farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic pasta, my other sister settled for the grilled salmon salad, and I ordered the spinach bacon eggs Benedict.  They gave us complimentary bread with butter. They were both delicious! Our appetizer was good. A tad bit pricey for the portion and it was a bit spicy but I say 4/5 stars. My sisters enjoyed their entree. I got to try a bit of the pasta but something about it wasn't right. I like to say the pasta may not be cooked right and with it dousing in the sauce it was okay. I didn't try my other sister's salad. Only the salmon which was yummy. It was not fishy and it was cooked just right. As for my dish...it was a bit disappointing. I love eggs but I like them cooked right. Unfortunately, one of them was cooked as a hard boiled egg. Fortunately the waiter was nice enough to give mr another poached egg but I ended up letting my sister have it with her salad.

But seriously, if you pay with cash here, best to double check the numbers. A chunk of it may be missing for their own personal gains. In addition, the receipt I asked for before leaving, was a pre-printed receipt that only showed me the total owed. NOTHING to document the transaction (coupon, gift card, cash, etc).

273,G.E. C.,"Houston, TX",0,10,,1.0,2016-04-27,"I have been to several Cheesecake Factory's in Houston, as well as in other states. The food in the past has been consistently decent if not decadent, and the portions huge. This time in addition to shoddy service, the portions were tiny and the food, chicken in my case, over cooked and dry. The waiter's check back was so late that all in my party were just about finished and ordering something else was out of the question. Dirty dishes piled up on our table without being bussed. The people behind us walked out because after waiting a very long time, they still had not been served. My friend's appetizer salad was embarrassingly tiny, and she sent it back. The waiter explained they were under new management and many in the kitchen were new, too. Also, it seems, many of the waiters were new. I don't know if all Cheesecake Factory's are undergoing comparable changes, but until Sugarland's figures things out, I would avoid theirs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sugar-land?start=240,2.4,2.7,2.7,1.604,2.58

64,Allen T.,"Sugar Land, TX",2071,293,2546.0,1.0,2016-05-30,"Last night my family and I were looking for a place to have a late dinner where we've had good service and good food in the past and the Cheesecake Factory came to mind.  Now granted it has been quite a while since we've been out here but in the past we've always been fairly happy with this location.  Last night was a disaster though. I'm not sure what happened to this place but service and smiles were definitely lacking and the staff seemed more interested in socializing among themselves than projecting general warmth and service to their patrons, namely us!   I kind of sensed something was awry when I walked in and the hostess was busy engaged in some kind of banter with her coworker at the front. Without making eye contact or smiling at me as had been typical in the past, her body language and attitude indicated to me an elitist kind of attitude.  It seemed they wanted to shove us in the worst booth in the place even though the restaurant was relatively slow and the middle section with better views of the interior were quite open!   The guy who walked us over there seemed tired or totally disinterested in us.  Zero smile or energy at all. He mumbled something like your server will be with you shortly and left.  As we sat there I'm thinking we got the worst booth in the house and the worst attitude. After what seemed like a long time, I looked up waiting for this so called server and nobody approached us and nobody even asked if we needed water or drinks!   I'm sitting here trying to make eye contact with someone to come help us and the hostess walks right by us and it looked and felt like she deliberately wanted to avoid us!  At that point I was starving and highly annoyed and gathered my family and said let's leave.  As I was walking out the hostess who initially helped us didn't even seemed like she cared and kind of shrugged her shoulders.  I glared at her and asked if I could speak to the manager and asked who he was and she barked something like he's the guy over there with the tie,  almost rolling her eyes.  My wife and kids had already exited the restaurant and I starting getting the manager's attention and he approached me. His name was Matt and he told me he, yes was the manager. I was a bit upset and he could tell and in fairness to him he tried to ""make it right"" but at that point after being treated the way we were treated, did not ever want to come back here again!   I have been coming here for years but last night the service and smiles and attitude were sorely lacking and downright rude! Matt had said he had only been there for 3 months and maybe that's what the problem was. Maybe he can fix it. Maybe not but in my opinion this place has gone way downhill.... Nice and pretty inside but the worst attitudes and service I have experienced in a long while. I rarely give one star reviews. Maybe this is my only one but after last night this place for sure deserved it! We've always loved the food at the Cheesecake Factory. I used to work in the Galleria area and discovered this chain many many moons ago but this was the absolute worst experience I've ever had at a Cheesecake Factory.  Maybe Matt the manager was sent there to fix the problems. Hopefully he can but as far as my family and I we've been treated much better in many other less ""showy"" places.  We won't be back Customer service is a big part of the experience and last night it was the worst I've had in recent memory...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sugar-land?start=40,2.16,2.7,2.7,1.5080000000000002,2.484

I had brunch at the Sugarland location last Sunday 6/12/16 and the customer service was so awful! If zero star was an option, I will actually give that score! Anyways, here's my review. As usual, my best friend and I ordered the Fried Chicken and Waffles Benedict. Like I always do, I specifically told our server (Gabrielle) that I wanted fried eggs instead of the Eggs Benedict that it comes with because I am not a fan of the hollandaise sauce. Waited for a while and when our food order came, the fried egg was still topped with the sauce. I brought it to the attention of our server and to my surprise, she got very defensive and argued that ""you only substituted the fried egg for the poached egg"" and the chef will still top it with hollandaise sauce!"" I explained to our server that this was not the first time I have ordered this chicken & waffles this way and my order has always come out right! I explained that I ordered fried eggs versus the eggs Benedict (not just poached eggs) because I don't want the poached egg & the sauce at all! Then the rudest manager came to our table with such an attitude trying to explain and rectify what had happened. He then proceeded to tell me again that even if I asked for fried eggs, the kitchen will still top it it with the sauce.  At this time, I was already pissed off because he is making a liar out of me! I told him that I have ordered this before in this location and the order always came out right! Then he tried to apologize and asked me at this point if I want him to fix the order? I declined and told him that all I wanted to do was to make management aware. I also refused the offer to fix my order because I did not want to wait any longer than we have at this point! I really felt that his apologies was not sincere, pretentious and we felt like he just wanted show his face do the manager thing and slap us with a free dessert to make us feel better! no thank you!!! It will be a very long time before I return to this establishment! I'm also suggesting for the employees in this location to take a trip to any Chick Fil A and learn great customer service skills!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sugar-land?start=140,2.08,2.66,2.66,1.604,2.428

Craving their Louisiana Cajun Pasta, we decided to go around lunch time. I decided to sit by the Bar, in a booth, where the clear glass divider is because we never sat in that section before. So I order a drinks, and of course, they brought out the Rock bread because It was hard as a rock. Told the server and she brought out more. No difference.  Anyway My Son and I were talking and I just happen to glance at the glass and there were like 9 Baby Flies, (Yes I counted Them) on the glass. It's like They were just sitting there watching us. Lolol. Then I told my son, there are things watching us. He looks, grins, and says ""Ummmm...Momma one landed on the bread, I thought you seen it."" Ummmmm No I didn't Son. I then look at the glass again, then the wall and there's a roach crawling on the wall. That's it, I'm done. So the Server comes back and I tell her we're leaving and why. She looks and see the flies and roach, she apologize, and go and tell the Head Manager, Dress shirt and Tie Man. He comes over and looks at the glass and wall and says,""Where are they?"" I laughed and shook my head. Then the server said, ""RIGHT THERE!"", while pointing at them. Then another manager comes and apologize, offering whatever on the menu for free. No Thanks. Told them to just fix problem and the restaurant is too beautiful to have these problems. If their friends are coming out of the kitchen to greet customers, they're having parties and meetings in the kitchen. My Son and I exited CF and have yet to return.

The food took 30 minutes or more to get to our table. Tim served me a Coke that he knew was flat cause he admitted it to me when I requested a different Coke product. We had ordered a cheesecake and were not provided any forks or plates to eat it. We had to borrow plates and forks from a different table. Like my dad had to get up and get them himself! Our food wasn't bagged to go instead we were handed the tools to do it ourselves . But I saw Tim bag the table next to us food.  This was my first time taking my family here cause they have never been and we will never return because the service was poor and our server was incompetent.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sugar-land?start=60,1.88,2.48,2.48,1.4120000000000001,2.24

Never NEVER come to this Cheesecake Factory with a big party. Made a 12 person reservation for 7:30 on a Monday night for my family with the restaurant knowing they had a big party at 6:30 prior to us. Throughout our HOUR wait (again, with reservations), we were told that it would take 20 more minutes, then 30, then that they couldn't do anything. Then around the hour wait mark, we were informed that reservations can not be made here. Last weekend I was specifically told that no reservations could be made on weekends, BUT could be made on weekdays. The general manager kept insisting that no reservations can be made in general. If you look on this Yelp page though, it specially states that you can make reservations. Then we were informed by the hostess that they would seat us at another section, but we never were. I understand that you can't force a large party to leave, but don't tell us that no reservations could be made in the first place after we had already waited an hour. Excuse after excuse.

But this past year has been just disappointing. When manager Mike was here the service was awesome. We have literally waited almost 30 minutes for someone to come and get our drinks order. We had an incident here once with my daughters food. It had a piece of metal in one of her chicken tender. Luckily I saw it before she had a chance to eat it. We told manager Mike and he apologized and took care of the bill. We kept coming to this location after all because we knew he took care of it and he appreciated us coming back. We have left several times because the service is just horrible. They take long to bring the drinks and the food, specially the bread. They always have excuses for it. It's in the oven, it's coming ,  and when it does comes its all hard and cold. Two weeks ago I went with my daughters and it took them 30 min to come and get my drinks. I was still waiting to order so we got up and left. Then we went back a week later with my husband and 30 min later and there was no bread. We were getting anxious and the kids were hungry. An hour past and we only had our drinks no bread no food. So we called some worker passing by and asked her that what was going on and she said that there was a fight and that our server was involved that she was gonna call the manager to come and talk to us. We kept waiting 15 more minutes and just decided to leave. Yes there was a fight we saw the cops outside and the people involved in the fight were been interrogated by the police. I saw our server hiding in the kitchen all this time. He didn't sent someone to check on us. I know the manager could of been busy and all but the fight was at the bar and they took it outside it wasn't in the kitchen where the food is made. This is our last time coming here.

Detailed Review: I ate here on Saturday night around 8:30PM for a birthday party. First of all, I knew we would had a long wait for a table so I didn't mind the wait. After about 30 min, our party decided to stay in the patio area instead of waiting for a table inside the restaurant. Our waittress took our orders and everything looked fine at that time until... A few of us got our meals except for me and a couple of other people. We had to wait another 30 min again for our meals to arrive. I had ordered a medium rare classic burger with sweet potatoes fries (not knowing it would be the BIGGEST MISTAKE EVER!!!). Everything was too SALTY but I decided to eat it anyways since I didn't want to wait to order a different meal. So we left Cheesecake around 10:30PM... Everything seemed normal until I woke up in the middle of the night at 3AM feeling nauseous & had major stomach pains. I stayed up for 1 hr trying to vomit but instead, I went #2... I went back to bed & thought it was over... The very next morning, I went to use the restroom & I knew I had food poisoning due to the color & consistency of my diarrhea! I used my restroom more than 15 times that day (no joke, sorry for being too graphic here). I called Cheesecake factory to speak with the GM knowing that they probably wasn't there or was busy.

We though, ""What better than good old Cheesecake Factory""  the ambiance is quite spectacular. The beautiful interior has a vibe that is warm and inviting with a touch of class. The location is perfect near theFirst Colony Mall and bySugar Land Town Square, except parking is a little bit tedious. In order to combat parking frustration ,  Cheesecake Factory has valet so I must say quite a great service. As for the food, I must say I do enjoy a nice lunch menu. Though still a little pricey they have a good portion for their lunches. I usually get the miso salmon which I find quite delectable. This time I decided to experiment and tried the Shrimp and Sausage Rigatoni pasta. The presentation was beautiful, there was so much pasta I could not be happier. But I was disheartened at the fact that the salt levels were much to high for me, especially the sausage and pepper. It was like someone was messing with the salt shaker and the lid fell off while pouring it. I did like the shrimp it was cooked quite nicely.  The rigatoni itself was cooked in the perfect form for pasta, Al Dente. Unfortunately I was too stuffed to order dessert, but I do have to mention the iconic cheesecake! I have been here previous and I must say there original Cheesecake is spectacular! It is creamy and rich just how a good dessert needs to be, plus the crust pairs a crumbly texture that matches perfectly. Cheesecake Factory knows how to make cheesecake, just maybe not so much in the sausage and one of the pasta sauce department.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sugar-land?start=20,1.84,2.22,2.22,2.1239999999999997,2.068

We place the whole order drinks and appetizers. It was unbelievable that our drinks ( I ordered a beer) came after our food. I let the manager know how things happened and he had the courage to look me in the eyes and say that the drinks take a long time because they are made from the scratch!! I ordered a beer!!

And then actually ordering the actual food takes at least 30 minutes from the initial time I sit down. I have never had a friendly server at this specific location and something always goes wrong with the food AND the managers are somehow worse than the servers!  I ordered Fettuccine Alfredo last time I came in, and they gave me Chicken Alfredo- I honestly didn't want to pay for the extra chicken so I waited about 15 minutes for our server to come back around and told him that he gave me the wrong food (I wasn't even rude about it!) he grabbed my plate and left and the manager comes by looks at me and says ""you didn't want chicken?"" And then grunts when I say no and leaves...... great customer service! I got my fettuccine after my boyfriend had finished eating.

The normally delicious cauliflower/carrot/green salad that accompanies skinnylicious tacos consisted of three pieces of cauliflower, all of which were covered in brown spots. None of my children had more than two bites of their entrees, which they typically devour. Even my daughter's Shirley temple wasn't mixed right. Would have been better just to burn $60.

18,Diana N.,"Richmond, TX",90,112,165.0,4.0,2017-03-27,"I love pasta, their chicken Madeira, and cheesecake so I come here sometimes (actually rarely), but I don't love the service, the loud environment, and cramped 2-people tables. Service is especially slow if you have a large group, although this place physically fits a big group well, and there's something on the menu for everyone (it's like a novel). Even getting a refill on bread can take awhile. This time I walked right into the restaurant to meet up the rest of my party without the hostess even greeting me; she didn't even look up from her hostess stand at all actually. For appetizers, the calamari here is consistently good. Hot and crispy with good dipping sauces. The avocado egg rolls were good too.  I ordered the Cajun jambalaya pasta for the first time. It was humungo of course, and the linguine tasted good. Id say it could've been cooked maybe a minute less though since the pasta was more soft than I prefer (especially when reheating the leftovers). The chicken was a little bland (needed some salt or seasoning), but at least it wasn't dry. The shrimp had more flavor but was a little tough/ overcooked. There was a good amount of protein to carb ratio at least, which I'm always looking for. I ate this meal on 3 different occasions bc it's so much food. I hardly get to eat pasta (macros) so I still enjoyed the jambalaya flavor of the noodles which were just a tad spicy (says very spicy on the menu). Husband got the usual chicken Madeira, which is always good. The mashed potatoes are so buttery and smooth. His mother's farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic tasted more bland than usual, even for a more subtle dish/flavor profile in general? Brother in law ordered his usual Louisiana chicken pasta, which I didn't hear any complaints about. Other dishes we've ordered in the past that id recommend include the Thai lettuce wraps (which are enough for a meal), pasta da vinci, and the steak Diane and chicken Madeira combo (although I prefer just the chicken more than the steak).  Also we ordered an original cheesecake slice to share between my husband and I. Ive never had a bad flavor here (but I looove dessert! Esp chocolate), but my husband's go to is the original. So good, light, sweet, but not too rich. Mmm. Worth it (the $ and calories)!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sugar-land,1.72,2.02,2.02,2.288,1.9

I got so scared because it's really heavy (stainless steel outside) and i only managed to catch it at the end. There was a hostess in the bathroom, i asked her for ice and a manager. She came back with only ice, and asked if i wanted to see the manager. Duh! I waited for a good while in the bathroom for the manager, finally my kid stopped crying and i told her to send the manager where the were sitting (she had sat us at the booth do i figured she knew, there wasn't a lot of people). When i got back to the booth, we still hadn't gotten our drinks. It had been close to 15  minutes of me being gone. My husband said to took them over 5 Minutes for someone to even acknowledge him. He ordered our lemonades from someone then a few minutes later our actual waitress comes by asks him what kind of drinks he was going to order. After that, that waitress was pretty good at attending us. Food was pretty bad. I ordered the steak tacos. Everything was freshly made but the cook went over board with the cumin on the rice, i couldn't eat it, i even tried to fix it with salt and lime but, no. The black beans looked really good but tasted like mud. Tacos were pretty terrible. Whatever sauce they put in them, throws everything off and red onions are over bearing. My husband ordered medium rare steak and shrimp. That came with mushrooms in something called Diane sauce. The sauce tasted like the smell of stinky feet. I've never had Diane sauce and i don't know what it should taste like but, that was different. His steak was more on the rare/blue rare side. He didn't like his mashed potatoes (idk why, i didn't taste them) his shrimp were extremely breaded, hardly any shrimp in there. We ordered cheese cake, it was good but too sweet for the both of us to keep eating. We didn't complain, we're really not people that would complain. This was his first time in over 10 years eating here. I've never been here. I Don't want to come back. P. S.  Manager never came by our table, i don't even think that the hostess even told her manager. I felt really bad for my son but in the end he was fine, just really fussy.

We ordered an appetizer, I was also going to eat a couple of appetizers for my meal, I wanted the artichoke, he said he would check if they had it, came back and said yes. 10 minutes later another waitress says they don't have it, okay, I order a salad. My salad comes out and my husbands food doesn't. We wait and wait and finally are told his meal went to someone else but they would be making his now...we wait and wait and wait.

I called them, but I was on hold for about 15 minutes. I decided to go back to the restaurant to check. I was standing at the hostess' table. The hostess was on the phone. I waited patiently. When she was done, she just looked at me, ignored me, and turned around talking to someone else. She didn't even give me an acknowledgement. I was worried about my credit card, so I asked another server. He was way more helpful. He found the manager and I got my card back.  Conclusion: the food was good but pricy (for what you pay for).

Lets start off with the cheesecake we ordered, hazelnut crunch cheesecake and holy moly this was so decadent and delicious in the most addicting way. Crunchy hazelnut throughout the cheesecake with the sweet rich Nutella on top of the cheesecake was just perfection.  My favorite dish here is the miso salmon, because its a simple light but super flavorful and yummy plate of food that will fill you up but will not make you feel heavy. I ordered brown rice instead of white to attempt to be healthy. Hahah!  We also ordered the herb crusted salmon and avocado, mango chicken salad. The herb crusted salmon could have used a bit more seasoning but it was laid on the most smooth and creamy mash potatoes! The salad was good, but they did forget one of the major ingredients which turned out the be the avocados! This was much needed since it added the creamy texture to the salad.

My sister came in earlier to book us a table but it was so packed when we came in she had to come and lead us to the table. The entire we were there water would drip from the ceiling every now and then, which our server explained as the vents. Interesting....didn't know it was so hot in here, cuz I can't think of any other reason for drops of water hitting me every ten minutes. Anyway I ordered a J.W's sparkling lemonade on ice, fried Mac and cheese, and Romano chicken, while the rest of my party got an appetizer sampler and steak/meatloaf. I liked the firecracker salmon that was part of the sampler and my Mac, though I think they should have used cheddar too instead of what I think was just mozzarella. My lemonade had too much booze, I was expecting it to be a little sweeter. As for my pasta dish, the pasta and the sauce were great and the chicken was very crispy, however it was also bland. The dish also hardly tasted of cheese despite the menu stating there was Parmesan and Romano. Maybe it was just in the sauce? Hm. Bc it was my birthday, I also got a special birthday song, yay! For dessert we all got at least one cheesecake except Auntie....she was full. I got to try pumpkin spice cheesecake, the Godiva cheesecake, and my cheesecake, the 30th anniversary chocolate cheesecake! It was so luscious, and made even better by the fact that I got it a la mode (aka with vanilla ice cream). It appears they change their cheesecake flavors periodically, since the pineapple cheesecake my aunt wanted was no longer made. Our server was excellent, and the main reason I bump this to four stars, she did an excellent job despite having other customers to work with. Next time I come though I'll just get cheesecake, the factory has a way of making dishes that make people too full for dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sugar-land,2.2,2.08,2.448,,2.128

It would have been nice to know that our wait time was extended since we were waiting outside in the cold weather. All we got from the manager was a simple ""I'm sorry"". He did absolutely nothing to fix the issue or seat us quickly. As I talked to the manager all I got was a head nod and a bad attitude. He as a manager looked very young, inexperienced and had no idea how to handle the situation. I honestly felt like I was talking with my teenage son.

Everything I've ever ordered there has been delicious, but my favorite are their burgers--some of the best I've ever eaten. So I'll probably continue to visit occasionally, despite the negatives. And there are negatives. Specifically, the service. No matter when I visit or how busy the restaurant is, the waitstaff always look and act harried and overwhelmed. You seem to have a 60/40 of getting ""complimentary"" bread and not getting any. Sometimes the waitperson claims the kitchen is working on baking a fresh batch, only it never materializes. Sometimes they act like they've never heard of the concept. Since I'm pretty sure the cost of that bread is built into the menu prices, this is ridiculous. You'll also spend most of your meal waiting: waiting for someone to show up and take your order, waiting on a drink refill, waiting for the check, waiting to get your credit card back. During my last trip, the waitress said she'd be right back to refill my water and then disappeared for ten minutes. I started sucking on my ice cubes while I waited, and when she finally returned and saw me, she acted annoyed and muttered something about how I couldn't wait. Nice. Not sure if it's a problem with being chronically understaffed, poor training, or what, but I know that I--and I'm sure many others--would be visiting more often if the service was just as high-quality as their food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sugar-land?start=20,2.24,2.09,2.44,,2.1500000000000004

9,H P.,"Sugar Land, TX",2,36,42.0,3.0,2018-01-01,great place for dessert because they are known for their cheesecakes. the whole-wheat bread with butter is a must try. over the year the menu keep on changing which is good and bad. they took away our favorite dish asian chicken over rice. we stop coming to eat. great decor and ambiance for dining,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sugar-land,2.56,2.07,2.432,,2.266
7,Angela M.,"Stafford, TX",1,5,1.0,1.0,2018-01-13,The quality of food here has completely gone down. My chicken costoletta was disappointing and my boyfriend was not happy with his chicken marsala. We weren't happy with drinks either. We won't be returning after today.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sugar-land,2.52,2.07,2.424,,2.25
