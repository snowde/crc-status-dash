220,Harvey D.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",216,406,,2.0,2012-03-12,"I have eaten at The Cheesecake Factory many times and never really had a bad experience.  Until now...  This was my first time eating at this location and it wasn't great.  I had the Factory Burger and my wife ordered a pasta dish.  We had both ordered these menu items in the past so we thought we knew what we were getting.  Apparently not.... My wife's entree was significantly smaller than before with much less pasta than the times she had ordered it before.  My burger didn't taste great and I actually had trouble finishing it.  However, the most disappointing aspect of my meal was the fries.  They used to serve the shoestring fries and they would give you a huge amount of them.  They now not only give you less fries, but they changed the fries to a much thicker version and not as tasty.   We did have to wait approx. 15 minutes to get seated.  Out waitress was very good and she refilled drinks promptly and the food was served in a timely manner.   Overall, this location just isn't up to par with the other locations I have eaten at and I wouldn't go back here.  There are plenty of other Cheesecake Factories in this area so I don't need to go back here.  And I hope that they go back to their old style of fries!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sunrise?start=220,3.56,3.56,3.56,2.9200000000000004,3.5600000000000005

I have been eating here for years, and don't think that I have ever been dissatisfied. The menu is pretty much a book. I do not know of any restaurant, anywhere, with this many menu items. Here are just a couple of my favorites: sourdough bread is heavenly! Chinese chicken salad. It's the best one anywhere (and the prettiest too). Lunch portion is smaller, and still huge. Sweet corn tamale cakes...just total yumminess. 3 beautifly presented corn cakes (slightly sweet) atop a long leaf of corn, garnished with guac, sour cream, and the most delicious sauces. This is a unique and amazing dish that will have your taste buds dancing! Fried mac and cheese balls...need I say more? Review would not be complete without a mention of cheesecake. Everyone has their fave. Mine is chocolate raspberry truffle. Two pieces of advice: 1. Share whenever possible. 2. Save room for cheesecake.

My husband and I ordered the meatloaf sandwich. Delicious! The side of mashed potatoes that seemed to definitely be homemade were outstanding! My sister ordered these buffalo chicken bites and it looked like a tower when it came out. My brother in law went for the Asian style sushi appetizer. I wish I remembered the name but after picking from their plates here and there I must say that everything was good! We of course had no room for dessert so I left with the Oreo cheesecake in mind.

171,Bianca L.,"New York, NY",160,131,87.0,4.0,2012-07-21,"Honestly, this place is really great. I am from New York and I still really enjoy this chain restaurant. The Cheesecake Factory has good food way beyond cheesecake. I've been there a couple of times every time I visit my parents in Florida and I have NEVER disliked my food. The clam chowder is AMAZING. Creamy, and oh! so so tasty :)  I've had a few of their burgers, but yesterday I tried the Macaroni and Cheese burger. It was ok... it does not taste like much. I think they could definitely make the ball of mac n' cheese a little more spiced up, and top everything off with a special sauce, or something. The fries are amazing, though! My mom had the bang bang chicken and shrimp and loved it. I've had some chicken chipotle pasta in the past (can't remember the name) and it was so awesome that I usually take that. The portions are so huge that I have to take the rest home and it's enough to fulfill my hunger at lunch the next day. And let's be honest, pasta is always best when reheated the next day. I had their Mai Tai, it was such a delicious cocktail! Can't wait to go back. All the cheesecakes are good...

215,Charlotte W.,"Toronto, Canada",109,473,60.0,2.0,2012-09-28,"I am not a really huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory, but as I was with my Canadian friends, they really wanted to try this place out (as they heard so much about it). I never order from their regular menu as I just can't imagine scarfing down a minimum of 2500 calories in one go. If anyone has ever heard of the book, Eat This, Not That, Cheesecake Factory dishes are often on the Do Not Eat That category...and for good reason too. One of my friends ordered the Chicken Little which basically was a plate of not-so-little deep fried chicken pieces. As he ate, the pieces actually seemed to multiply (that's how big the plate was). My bf ordered the Monster Burrito which comes on a lobster-sized platter. The waitress describes the burrito as big as a wrestlers arm, and she wasn't kidding - filled with rice, beans, guacamole, cheese and sour cream, this will be enough to feed an entire family. At Cheesecake, I always order from the lighter fare menu which lists out caloric content. I had a salad, but my salad came with a heap of rice?!?  My friends ended off with a HUGE slice of the Red Velvet Cheesecake which was delish, but nothing special. All in all, if you want a mega-caloric-artery-clogging experience, come to the Cheesecake.

160,Joshua G.,"Eatonville, WA",7,22,10.0,4.0,2012-12-20,"Given that this is a chain, I'm always amazed at the quality. I had my favorite dish there, the Steak Diane and Salmon combo.  It was wonderful as always.  The steak was cooked exactly as ordered.  The Salmon was not overcooked (which seems to be a miracle these days). I also ordered their popcorn shrimp and the batter was nice and light.  Good dipping sauce. And to top off the DECADENT factor, some of their Lemon Cello Cheesecake.  Which is great.  Wonderful fresh lemon flavor. The service was very fast.  I called in my order over the phone while I was about 8 min away.  When I got there my food was ready about 5 min later.  Which was really impressive since it was after 6pm and the place was packed. For those reviewers complaining about the calories... Come on... it's called THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY!  Don't eat there every day and it's not a big deal.  You can splurge periodically.  And they do have PLENTY of lower calorie dishes to choose from. I've eaten at many of the various locations in my travels and found they are almost always very consistent in their food quality.  The one or two times I have had even the smallest issue with something not being right with my order, I was immediately treated to a free dinner on the house either that day or another day during my travel stay. The ONLY negative I could give this particular location is parking is a bit of a challenge as it's part of the big Sawgrass Mills Mall.  So depending on the time of day, you might have to hike to get in from the parking lot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sunrise?start=180,3.64,3.64,3.64,3.248,3.6400000000000006

I've tried a few items, but of course the cheesecake is really good.

People have been to ""The Cheesecake Factory"" time and time again and know what the deal is, but I love The Cheesecake Factory! So I will review it! My favorite location is in Florida, of course. Everything is always better in warmer temperatures with a little sun. Located in ""Sawgrass Mills Mall"" (Largest mall in south Florida) this Cheesecake Factory is large. What I also like is that  this particular location of the mall is all open, with no rooftop. So you can dine at the seating area outside(which I prefer) and enjoy the nice weather.  Whenever I go down there, I prefer lunch at the cheesecake factory. Their menu is ridiculously huge. I look through about 10 times just to narrow it down to atleast 3 options lol. They had this burger, which I don't see anymore, unless they changed the name, but it was a huge burger with cheese and lettuce and onions and tomato and a perfectly cooked egg right on top. And yes, it's simple enough and a lot of places serve a burger like that, but this one is done really right. Yum! I also love love love their ""Spicy Chicken Sandwich"". Crispy chicken breast covered with melted cheese(your choice) and either spicy buffalo sauce or chipotle mayo served on a brioche bun. I'd go with the mayo. It's a really big sandwich too, even I can't finish it!. I've also had their ""Kobe burger"" which fell in the category of not so great, but i'll give it another go, just to make sure.  They also have this really great lunch special with their pizza menu. It comes with an appetizer (I get caesar salad) and you choose any one of their pizzas. And guess what?! It's unlimited! Their pizza is really good too. I recommend the ""Tomato, Basil, and Cheese pizza"".  So you see, even though  the Cheesecake Factory is a chain and everyone has been there, it has some really great eats.

I am in love with their snickers cheesecake and their passion fruit mojito. It is a sweet combination and it can get overwhelming but it is my only way. The snickers cheesecake has a dark chocolate base and then the delicious cheesecake with some caramel and chocolate on top and let me say that it is the most amazing cheesecake you will ever have! The mojito itself is a basic mojito but with an added passion fruit flavor and it is just refreshing and delicious.  I have had a long range of their meals and I don't think there's enough characters here to mention but the Louisiana chicken pasta is worth the time.

I was trying to not spend a ton of money so we went light, but the bill was still about $60 which is by no means light, but I know where I could have trimmed...   We started off with the white bean hummus as a cheap and quick little appetizer.. can't go wrong there.. Love it, and it comes out as fast as the drinks. I had a lunch size pasta, farfalle with roasted garlic and sundried tomatoes, and requested the fried chicken with it for a change.. I usually don't eat the chicken, and was thinking the fried chicken would be a good leftover for the kids later on... We also got the lunch size ""Shepard's Pie."" It's a cottage pie guys...not a Shepard's pie..get it right. Always a delicious option for lunch.. filling and full of hidden veggies... I ordered the kids some chicken fingers, but as usual they ate most of my food, and the chicken fingers went home..  Husband loves the mint green tea.  I told Jamie to skip on the ridiculously small sized glass, unless she wanted to fetch a refill almost immediately..she took heed of the warning and brought him out a big glass, to save her the steps, and him the chance of being parched.  Great experience the other day.  Jamie was a rock star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sunrise?start=80,3.48,3.48,3.48,3.2120000000000006,3.4800000000000004

That being said, I think I finally figured out the secret to Cheesecake Factory - HAPPY HOUR!!  Happy Hour is from 4-6pm, a little short and early for my liking, but I can usually get in there and enjoy it from 5-6.   Some wines, drinks and beers are $5 - mojitos, margaritas etc.  There are also specially priced menu items at $5.  For a Cheesecake Factory these are great prices!   The corn tamale, roasted artichoke, avocado eggrolls just to name a few are excellent.

106,Jessie L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",44,103,23.0,3.0,2014-11-30,"The Cheesecake Factory is always so over-crowded. Good luck not waiting at least a half an hour. Packed with your average fat fuck Americans who need cheesecake like a hole in the head. But last night I lucked out and came here with 3 other people and were seated right away. Upon being escorted to our seating area, the 4 of us almost slipped and fell. The floors in here were so slippery that we could've moon-walked to our seats. One issue with The Slip 'N Fall Factory is that their menu is like an encyclopedia, making it nearly impossible to order in a timely fashion. They have 2 pages of just ""Specialties"", which are mainly all chicken dishes. We found ourselves using the process of elimination just to order. I think that's why the wait times here are usually ridiculous, because most peoples' time is spent on deciding on what to order. Not to mention the horses who stuff their faces with cheesecake that park themselves for an hour or 2 after they're finished to digest their food, disregarding the other patrons waiting to be seated. The food is good. I don't think that I've ever had bad food here. The caesar salad was excellent, after they finally got to us. We saw one food runner whose GPS clearly wasn't working, walk past our table several times with our caesar salads. Later in the evening, he ran spaghetti and meatballs to the party next to us and he served it over the wall next to them, causing his dirty rag that he wipes up his sweat with to fall into the food. The oblivious people ate it anyways. The main courses were very good. About mid-meal, we called for a manager to inform him of the slippery floors and the bloody murder that occurred in the ladies' room. There was blood on the sink, piss on the toilet seats, and no toilet paper. The manager arrived, and he was of Asian descent, about 21-years-old. I've never seen a Chinaman so tall. He informed us that the slippery floors were grease from the food, and he said that he'd take care of it right away. He sent out a sweeper who I saw sweep up about 4 or 5 tiles, and the slipperiness was in every square inch of the joint. On exit, the floors were even greasier than before.

The Food: You will always get your money's worth in food, and it's good every time. I'm simply amazed at the binge of dishes they have, which at times can seem a bit overwhelming. But whatever your selection may be, expect a well prepared and flavorful dish. The Drinks: I like sitting at the bar when by myself. The house wines are good. The mixed drinks tend to be hit or miss, but usually they're good. Only gripe is they sacrifice elbow room for more seats at the bar. Cramming more seats at the bar is a good way to send the wrong message to your customers. The Cheesecake: Does anybody actually eat the cheesecake here?

Not bad and is what we were told, however, we were not seated in the booth we requested so we were told 15 more minutes.  While waiting I went ahead and ordered two pieces of cheesecake to go for later.  The gentleman ran me up and closed out my order and I waited for my two deserts.  After fifteen minutes I asked him where were my deserts?  Incredibly he forgot to get our order and we had to wait again.  NP  Our table was still not available anyway and we spoke with manager Antonio who was very nice and apologetic about our experience thus far and personally ensured we got the appropriate booth within five minutes.  After being sat my wife and I both ordered the shrimp scampi as we do two to three times each month here.  The scampi is usually awesome and to die for (were addicted to the sauce).  On the visit tonight it continued to go down hill when, after 25 minutes, we were served cold shrimp and pasta so over cooked it was one big clump of rubber.  At this point we were ready to go and chaulk it up as just a bad night.  Evidently our server Cydney, who was very nice as well, let the manger know about our scampi and desire to leave.  The manager, Sandy, came by our table and asked what was wrong.  I told her the shrimp was cold and I also proceeded to show here how the block of pasta was overcooked she snapped ""I can see you don't need to show me"".  It was evident in her tone the she did not want to be there..... Seems she was having just as bad a night.  Sandy asked if we wanted our scampi replaced (over an hour now) we declined noting she really didn't want to be bothered.   On our way out we ran into manger Antonio again who inquired about our visit and we told him the mishaps.   I mentioned to him that after not even getting to eat I thought it was in bad taste that manager Sandy charged my wife for her glass of wine she never finished after such a bad experience.  Antonio agreed and asked us to please stay for a minute because it was his duty to make sure we leave happy and was going to be right back with us.   This is where they lost two good regular guests.  After five minutes Antonio returned and stated ""I am so embarrassed to tell you that Sandy took our meals off our check but insists on charging for the wine (even though it wasn't drunken) and she is senior to his position and there is nothing he can do"".  After getting crap service, crap food, and an attitude from Sandy on top my wife and I just looked at each other and we left for good.  As long as Sandy is employed at The Cheesecake Factory this restaurant is on our ""STAY AWAY"" list.  Fortunately they have a sister company next door Grand Lux Café (run very well) that just got some more regular customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sunrise?start=200,3.52,3.61,3.61,2.9160000000000004,3.5740000000000003

Gross. I exchanged it for a hot coffee instead.  Then our food took an hour to come out. I finally got my omelette and took the first bite.

They remade it but by the time they brought me a new one everyone in my party was done eating and I had lost my appetite.  We asked for boxes for the leftovers and a different waiter came and only had small boxes. When we asked for larger ones he said they didn't have any.

They told us it would be a 30min to 40 min wait. They kept extending the time and we ended up sitting about an hour and a half later. Terrible. Been here many times but it hasn't gotten this bad. Our food took a while. By the time we got it, I already lost my appetite. We were stuffing ourselves with their delicious bread and butter. Price wise, they're okay. Their portions are definitely big and you get your moneys worth or even more at times. Their food is great though. I'll give them that. My favorite is the Farfalle bowtie pasta and shrimp scampi. Their  complimentary bread and butter always served hot and delicious. Their calamari is absolutely delicious too. Lastly they really bring the name of cheesecake very well. My favorite is the red velvet and white chocolate. But because this is foreigner central, a lot of the diners here have luggage they carry with them and it gets crowded and a lot of families.

The food is consistent, the menu is huge, the service is significantly above average, the portions are large, and the prices are what you'd expect. And yes, the cheesecake is good (but definitely pricey).  Complaints revolve around how crowded the restaurants are and how long the wait for a table can be.  All of the above is true for the Sawgrass Mills location. Add in a terrible parking situation, and frankly, I usually avoid eating here. That's a shame because I've eaten here twice in the past three months and had a great meal and a good experience both times.  Friday night our party of three decided to try our luck at Cheesecake Factory around 6:30 pm. Both cars found nearby parking spots right away (unheard of!) and there was no wait to be seated (on a Friday!). Lesson learned - no one is shopping at that time on a Friday and crashing at Cheesecake Factory.  The hostess was very friendly and our server came by right away when we were seated. Soon after, our drinks were served, and warm wheat and sourdough bread was placed on the table. We loved the bread.  Recommendation - two new items on the menu were really great. The blood orange mojito my sister ordered was fantastic. It had a perfect mix of sweet and sour with a zip!  And the side dish of cooked carrots with pecans that I had was unbelievable. Sooooo sweet, and crunchy and just yum.  I really enjoyed my meal of herb crusted salmon with mashed potatoes and the aforementioned carrots. The salmon was perfectly cooked and seasoned, and came with a piccata-like lemon butter sauce. Delicious! The mashed potatoes were a pile of creamy starchy goodness. When dipped in the piccata-ish sauce, they were even better. There was plenty of everything to take home for another meal.  My family really enjoyed their chicken and shrimp meals as well, and we got cheesecake to go. I always recommend the chocolate mousse cheesecake if you're a chocolate lover like me!

I'm generally a lot happier in hole in the wall ethnic places than big chain restaurants, but I can't deny that the huge menu at Cheesecake Factory makes it easy for people with disparate tastes to eat together. In order to skip the wait on a Friday night, we opted to eat outside - luckily it was sort of nice outside. It was crazy busy, and I'm not sure if that was a typical evening or because it was the day after Hurricane Matthew luckily missed us. Our waitress was delightful and funny, and even though service was a bit slower than I expected because of our out-of-the-way seats, she definitely checked in on us regularly. Now, to the food. Stepping outside my comfort zone, I got the grilled chicken tostada salad. their description: Crisp Corn Tortillas Topped with Grilled Marinated Chicken Breast and Black Beans Piled High with Mixed Greens, Fresh Corn, Green Onions and Cilantro All Tossed in Our Vinaigrette and Garnished with Avocado Cream, Salsa and Sour Cream. When it arrived, I received a huge, huge, massively huge plate of salad greens. Everything else was buried by the salad. Eventually, I unearthed two little tostadas with grilled chicken and black beans on them, and piles of corn and tomatoes that looked and tasted like pico de gallo. So here's the problem - it's served with balsamic vinaigrette. Do you put pico and balsamic together? I don't. After I got a different dressing (BBQ Ranch), it was enjoyable, even though I felt like most of my evening was spent trying to find the different components of my salad. Don't think I'll get that one again.

I went to the girl who sat us and told her no one has asked our order. So she asks one of the other servers to take our order. She asked for our drinks and walked away. About 10 minutes later she comes back with the guys in our party's beer. Another 5 minutes later she brings us (girls) liquor drinks but still no waters. She told us they ran out of bread both white and brown, we were a little disappointed. She took our order and after 15 minutes she came out with bread saying look what I found lol I was confused where she ""found it"" but it was good so I was happy. One other strange last thing was my husband ordered the chicken potstickers and they only brought him 4 ... so 10 minutes later he got the single potsticker they forgot. Anyway ... it was just so much slower than usual service. It's usually a lot much more organized than this especially when our table alone spent $140.

I am amazed how they managed to keep the place look this good after all these years.  We went to the bar and it looked exactly the way I remembered The menu hasn't changed much neither.  The only differences is before  I used to order the dinner entrees and asked for the lunch portion., but now  there is a lunch special menu.  Since they have just a few beers on top, I decided to order their mojito.  It tasted pretty good but perhaps it was a bit pricey.  I should come back during their happy hours where the same drink will cost probably half of the regular price.  My wife ordered her Long Island Ice Teas as usual.  She thought they were pretty good. For lunch we tried a few items in their appetizer menu.  I love egg rolls so I ordered their egg roll samplers which came with 4 different kinds of egg rolls with 4 different kind of sauces.  They were all very crispy on the outside and the fillings were delicious.  My wife ordered the Tomato Basil Flat Bread and enjoyed it.  And also, how can you come to Cheesecake Factory without ordering a cheesecake?  My wife ordered their White Chocolate Carmela Macadamia Nut Cheesecake.  She apparently loved it because she was worried so much about the calories in the cheesecake.  She thought the carmela might be a bit too sweet.  Overall, we liked our meal.  The drinks were good, and so was the service.  I think we would come back during their happy hours for great deals on food and drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sunrise,3.04,3.36,3.36,3.248,3.2320000000000007

6,Julie F.,"Pompano Beach, FL",1608,475,1689.0,3.0,2017-04-13,"This place was packed and so was the mall. There was a wait for regular tables so we sat at the bar where you can order from the full menu. The bartenders (2) were a little overwhelmed as they were making the  drinks for the entire restaurant as well as waiting on patrons eating. I was surprised how many people were having (multiple) alcoholic beverages at lunch -- although most were tourists here on vacation. The menu is quite large and it takes a while to go through it. There's also a list of ""specials"" -- prices are the same on the regular menu so I guess it's just items they are featuring or pushing. Then there's a separate one for skinnylicious meals. These are ""lighter"" versions of menu items. Although that may not mean much. Calories are listed next to most items and if people really paid attention to the numbers some items would never be ordered. Eek! Inside the regular menu is a section -- buried a few pages back and on the lower half of one page -- that lists lunch specials with smaller portions of some items and combos like soups and sandwiches, et al.  I ordered off the skinnylicious menu and got a ""factory"" chopped salad. It had romaine lettuce, bits of avocado, bits of bacon, corn kernels, a smidgen of blue cheese, a few tiny bits of apples, and a few cubes of cooked white chicken meat. It came already mixed with a vinaigrette style dressing. It was a fairly large bowl (with 500 calories). I gave part of it away and basically picked out the pieces of chicken and avocado.  It wasn't bad, but not sure I would order it again.  This is not fine dining and you wonder how they can control such a large menu and do all the things correctly. It's loud and busy. It's not a place to linger and chat, but at least it's slightly better alternative to food court dining.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sunrise,3.16,3.39,3.39,2.9880000000000004,3.298

Passion fruit iced tea is so refreshing. Avocado egg rolls were on point. Two kinds of bread given with the meals. The people in our group who ordered pasta were not impressed with their dishes though. I only tried the chipotle chicken pasta which was strangely sweet instead of spicy and I didn't like it. Fish tacos were reported to be quite good. My sister had a chicken pot pie that was actually more like chicken soup with a round crust on top. Weird. But then came the desserts. Insert the little emoji with saliva dripping from its mouth. Never fails to impress. Everyone loved their cheesecake. The two graduates got a congrats written in chocolate syrup on their plates.

As we were seated, I said we were on our lunch hour and we would like separate checks.  The waitress eventually took our order.  Three of us ordered salads and one person ordered 2 appetizers as a meal.  The table next to us was seated about 10 minutes later and we watched them get served their hot meals. As the waitress was MIA, we went to inquire about our food as we were still on our lunch break.  The food finally came (as the table next to us finished their meals) and the hot appetizers that my friend ordered were room temperature.  I ordered Sheila's Chicken and avocado salad and I am here to tell you that there was no chicken and a few diced pieced of avocado. It took a while to flag down the server and she said she would go get me some ""extra"" chicken. I explained it was not ""extra"" as there was no chicken in the salad. I don't think she understood... My friend ate his appetizers because it was such a hassle to get my salad corrected.  Then the manager came over with 2 bowls of chicken and told me this was my ""extra"" chicken. I looked at him with amazement. Seriously, just adding the chicken to the salad is not okay as it does not have any of the flavors melded into it.  He offered to re-toss it as it would only take ""a minute"" - I agreed to have it re-tossed. However, due to the length of time, I took one bite and asked for it to go as it was getting late.  When the server came back, she inquired if we wanted the check ""split by 4"" and I said I had previously requested separate checks.  She again asked if we wanted it ""split by 4"" - There was a serious disconnect so one of my friends took over. A few minutes later she came out with a piece of cheesecake (sadly the person most wanted cheesecake, does not like the coffee flavored cheesecake.  I, personally, don't even like cheesecake. So, my friends picked at the cheesecake, my salad was off the check and we were out to lunch a lot longer that it should have been.  I don't foresee returning anytime in the near future.  There are way too many other places in the area that we can eat at more quickly with less aggravation.  I was sad as I have always enjoyed the salads and the brown bread  at the Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sunrise?start=20,3.44,3.41,3.41,2.504,3.422

Unfortunately, we didn't see much of our waiter, and had to flag down someone else for drink refills.

I'm glad its at a mall so we could walk off some calories. I will be back if out at Sawgrass shopping.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sunrise,3.32,3.36,3.36,,3.3440000000000003

You know when you're craving one specific thing and only want that one thing? Well, that was me yesterday. I ordered the eggplant Parmesan speciality and was informed well after ordering my meal that it wasn't available. Ok, I regrouped but the only thing that saved me was the sweet tamale cakes (appetizer for $10.95).  My son ordered a side Cesar salad and when it was brought to him they realized it was for the table behind us. My son pulled his fork from the salad and returned it only to get another salad 10 minutes later. I believe the croutons are sautéed and were waaaaaay too hard to chew.

First, it took the server 3 tries to bring a diet coke. He kept mixing the drinks and delivering regular coke. Brown bread was not available.  I order chicken and waffles and received eggs benedict, and to top it off, we order penne carbonara and the plate had a mix of spaghetti and penne pasta.  At this point our appetite was gone and decided to leave.  I remember that good old Cheesecake Factory, it was the place to go, but now the quality and service has gone down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sunrise,3.24,3.3,3.3,,3.2760000000000007

22,Marcos M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1,15,,1.0,2017-11-03,Cheesecake Factory used to be one of my favorite restaurants.  I would go there at least once or twice a month visiting all South Florida locations. I won't give up on it yet but my 2 most recent visits indicate there's a problem that needs to be fixed. Prices have inched up to depart from casual dining into the fine dining category which it definitely does not compete in. The shrimp scampi and Bistro shrimp ordered on the last 2 visits are just under $20 and come with pasta only. The shrimp are medium size not large or jumbo. On 1 different occasions the food was served cold. Inexcusable. Service has gone down hill. No checking back to follow up. Appetizers were ok but overpriced. The cheesecake is still the highlight of the meal. As far as food it was a major disappointment. I won't give up but will not return to the Sawgrass location for a while.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sunrise?start=20,2.92,3.27,3.27,,3.13

34,Melanie B.,"Hollywood, FL",27,7,,1.0,2017-11-21,I live across the street from the Sawgrass mall. My husband and I have gone frequently to the Cheesecake Factory. This was by far the worst experience I've ever had here. First we arrived on a Tuesday evening at 7:30. We were told it would be a 10-15 min wait. So by the time we were seated it was 35 min later. The hostess seats us at a table for four people with only 3 chairs and walks away leaving us standing there missing a chair. We had to take it upon ourselves to find a chair. It took another 30 min to get drinks and our appetizer came out before the bread. The waiter was inattentive in all aspects. We ended up not even having dessert because we were afraid we would've been stuck there waiting for another 30 min. Such a shame this place has gone downhill. I didn't even get into the fact that all the food came out a different times and my husbands dish had chicken and he doesn't eat meat. It was just a disaster from the start.

They have it.  American? They have it plus much more.  To top it off, you will have some of the best dessert options in town when you are done!  If it's available in the fall, go for the pumpkin cheesecake!  If you're not concerned about an overly healthy meal, I highly recommend trying the fried Mac and cheese.  Words can't describe this dish so I won't try.  Also, if you want a drink, you have to try the whisky smash.  It might be my favorite drink in the world.  It's strong enough to get the party started for anyone, but soft enough that a light drinker will also enjoy.  The only problem here is that there's almost always a solid wait time because, well, it's worth it.  If you haven't been to The Cheesecake Factory yet then you're obviously living under a rock.  Get yourself there!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sunrise,2.92,3.22,3.22,,3.1000000000000005

The staff is pleasant and welcoming. We had a great experience with the service and food. My only concern was almost all of the utensils were visible dirty. One of the forks had a creamy sauce on it. And both spoons had dry chocolate on the front and back. They should improve that and they would have definitely gotten 5 stars!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sunrise?start=20,3.04,3.22,3.22,,3.1480000000000006

Well that didn't happen. I ordered fish tacos and the dish was $15.50. So I expected a decent amount of fish. Maybe at least amounting to one fish steak spread over the 4 tacos I received. I was so disappointed when I looked at my dish and the pieces of fish all together that were in my meal didn't even make up an average size fish steak. To top it off the rice was still hard . I was so upset , so I asked for the manager, who insisted that it was a normal portion of fish for their tacos.  I did not expect that from this restaurant chain. I normally love the portions you get whether you eat in or take out.  And this was not on the lighter menu section, so they really dropped the ball here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sunrise,3.04,3.21,3.21,,3.142

However, I feel like the manager can offer some type of minor customer service to compensate for mistakes. On my last visit my wife and I ordered the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp (one of our favorites), the kitchen staff forgot to add the Shrimp to the meal. We decided to have them cook the shrimp and added to the meal. Meanwhile, the manager on staff on Thursday night came by while we waited and only offered a simple apology. After which, 15 minutes we received 4 miniature shrimps. Very disappointing. I hope that the next customer can be treated a little better for the mistake.
