112,Linda A.,"Liverpool, NY",0,10,,3.0,2014-02-08,"Ate lunch during the free preview promotion.  The restaurant looks beautiful and very clean and shiny. The 10 minute telling you how to order in a group was a turnoff , but you had to suffer it to get your seat.  This could have been done at your table in 2 minutes by a server or hostess. Our waitress was new but did a good job and we never had to look for her.  She had a great personality. Since it was a free preview the menu was limited.  The peach Bellini was excellent.  So was the beef kabob appetizer.  The salad and spicy chicken pasta were just okay.  I don't think I would order either again but try other dishes. The bread was average. Tried the apple streusel cheesecake.  It was okay..kind of dry without ice cream . I will be back when they are open for business to try other dishes and those great kabobs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-syracuse?start=100,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005
247,Tori L.,"Salem, United States",0,3,,2.0,2014-02-20,"Well...at first I was impressed. The decor was pretty upscale looking for a chain. Then we sit down excited to order some allegedly delicious food. We decided the buffalo blasts for an appetizer- they're out. I wanted chicken and biscuits- they're out. So we looked at the menu again and being that I don't feel like risking $18 for ""Italian"" or ""Chinese"" cuisine made by an American chain the only thing I can bring myself to order is a burger and fries. We also attempted to order the macaroni and cheese bites as an appetizer- they're out. She then assures us that they have ""like 30 other appetizers that are just as good"" but we were pretty darn discouraged at this point. So "" ""luckily"" for us they managed to keep enough artichoke dip on hand for us-which was good-thank god. While we waited for that my husband went and stood in line for some cheesecake to go for about 10 minutes only to discover that there is but one register back there- and apparently it is used to cash out the checks of the servers checks as well as people who want cheesecake- so- you stand in line with waitresses and hope that the chaos moves along quickly. My husband ordered ""the incredible eggplant sandwich"" which he sent back. We have been together 10 years and he has never sent a meal back! The eggplant was not flat or filleted, it was the whole eggplant cut in half, which rolls off the burger. He then ordered the spicy chicken sandwich and was very happy. I had a plain burger and fries and was satisfied. Cheesecake was phenomenal.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-syracuse?start=120,2.024,2.024,2.024,2.024,2.024

139,Justin V.,"Ithaca, United States",21,143,13.0,5.0,2014-02-28,"This place.....is amazing. I've never been to a Cheesecake Factory before so when I heard this was opening in the mall I had to check it out. We waited 3 hours to be seated and it was SOOOOOO worth it! The atmosphere here was awesome. We were seated by an awesome waiter who was very attentive with our needs and refills even though they were super busy. He made us feel as if we were important to him and not just another table which was great! We were also seated within view of the SU game which was awesome. We ordered drinks, apps and food and they all came very quickly. I started with a blueberry Mojito, my wife had the Peach mimosa and both were great. Easily one of the best mojito's I've ever had. For apps I got the Buffalo Blasts and Edamame. The buffalo blasts are chicken, cheese and buffalo sauce in a wonton wrapped, fried and served with blue cheese dressing and hot sauce. They we GREAT! Crispy, lots of filling and lots of flavor. I tasted the cheese and chicken, not just hot sauce. The blue cheese dressing was great too! It's hard to find good blue cheese dressing some times. The edamame was cooked perfect and salted perfectly. For the meal I got the Chipotle pasta with Honey Chicken. The portion was HUGE! The pasta was spicy but had GREAT flavor. Lots of chicken and the honey was a perfect contrast to the chipotle. I love sweet and spicy and this delivered on both notes. My wife got the chicken tacos and loved them! Lots of chicken and mix in's and again, big portions! They were very accommodating to our friend who was gluten free and lactose intolerant which was great! The waiter made sure that he was going to tell the cooks to be careful with her food and made every precaution when she was going to order to let her know if the food she was going to order had either in it. For a menu as large as they have I was surprised they knew almost the whole thing!!! Afterwards I got the Banana Cheesecake and my wife got the peanut butter chocolate one and both were the best cheesecake we've ever had. For a place with the title ""Cheesecake Factory"" they better deliver and they did. I was not hungry to eat the whole thing but it was so good I did haha. Overall the service, the food, everything made waiting 3 hours worth it in every sense. I would definitely wait again. The only suggestion I have, and I hope they see this review, is that they really should devise a better system for waiting. Right now they have the sensor things they give you and they only work so far from the restaurant. If you go out into the mall it won't beep. A lot of restaurants in the mall are doing cell phone numbers and calling you when your table is ready, that system is perfect and allows us to roam the mall whilst waiting so we are couped up just sitting waiting for our table. *Also....they totally sang to my friend for his birthday and gave him a small little treat! On a busy night too! Really made everything that much more special.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-syracuse?start=60,2.612,2.612,2.612,2.612,2.6120000000000005

Eating Food here was about the same as a cheep TV dinner pretending to be a upscale entree .They may make cheesecake but that don't mean they can actually cook anything beyond microwaved appetizers . They have a huge menu - it's not nearly as good a Denny's or a no name truck stop diner but the service was slow and the food tasted like it had been frozen and microwaved even though they say it's not. Pizza was horrible and so small it couldn't properly feed a single young lady who ordered it .  There were 4 of us who ordered all different meals . We agree that we won't be back here again . I ordered Shepard pie - really disappointed to the max. I didn't bother to finish it. My sister ordered a steak ($26) it was so small and of such low quality-  it was finished in 4 bites...we could have gotten a better tasting one at IHOP , we paid the $92 bill - for  low quality that your average diner could easily surpass . We walked  out still hungry and went to a pizza place  and got a few slices . $92 later and the food was inedible . I found the food to be on the same level as a cheap no name TV dinner that was pretending to be a upscale place . Don't waste your time here . I hate. TV dinners ,especially when they charge $25 for what taste like poorly cooked last months defrosted leftovers . Absolutely the worst service I have ever had in 50 years throughout my travels in over 72 countries and I live in SYRACUSE. I didn't try the cheesecake . I wouldn't come back here even if they paid me to eat the slop that they pass off as edible on their menu . Read my other reviews and you will understand that it's rare for me to ever write anything this negative- but this place earned this review,they begged for it .

Our waitress was new but did a good job and we never had to look for her.  She had a great personality. Since it was a free preview the menu was limited.  The peach Bellini was excellent.  So was the beef kabob appetizer.  The salad and spicy chicken pasta were just okay.  I don't think I would order either again but try other dishes. The bread was average. Tried the apple streusel cheesecake.  It was okay..kind of dry without ice cream . I will be back when they are open for business to try other dishes and those great kabobs.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-syracuse?start=100,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007
182,Steven M.,"Frederick, United States",1,52,54.0,1.0,2014-08-05,"The food was way over priced and I was way UNDER whelmed . Eating Food here was about the same as a cheep TV dinner pretending to be a upscale entree .They may make cheesecake but that don't mean they can actually cook anything beyond microwaved appetizers . They have a huge menu - it's not nearly as good a Denny's or a no name truck stop diner but the service was slow and the food tasted like it had been frozen and microwaved even though they say it's not. Pizza was horrible and so small it couldn't properly feed a single young lady who ordered it .  There were 4 of us who ordered all different meals . We agree that we won't be back here again . I ordered Shepard pie - really disappointed to the max. I didn't bother to finish it. My sister ordered a steak ($26) it was so small and of such low quality-  it was finished in 4 bites...we could have gotten a better tasting one at IHOP , we paid the $92 bill - for  low quality that your average diner could easily surpass . We walked  out still hungry and went to a pizza place  and got a few slices . $92 later and the food was inedible . I found the food to be on the same level as a cheap no name TV dinner that was pretending to be a upscale place . Don't waste your time here . I hate. TV dinners ,especially when they charge $25 for what taste like poorly cooked last months defrosted leftovers . Absolutely the worst service I have ever had in 50 years throughout my travels in over 72 countries and I live in SYRACUSE. I didn't try the cheesecake . I wouldn't come back here even if they paid me to eat the slop that they pass off as edible on their menu . Read my other reviews and you will understand that it's rare for me to ever write anything this negative- but this place earned this review,they begged for it .

Granted some of their dishes aren't that great, I have been sticking to 2-3 dishes that I have found to have liked on their menu that they do really well and do it really consistently. If you have never been to a cheesecake factory or have tried these dishes, I would absolutely recommend the bacon and shrimp sandwich and the thai lettuce wrap (appetizer). The bacon and shrimp is like a perfect meritage of shrimp and bacon and a sauce that is absolutely mouthwatering. Combined with a nice and toasted bread makes the sandwich absolutely delicious. The thai lettuce wrap is sometimes inconsistent with their chicken as it is sometimes dry and sometimes moist and tender. The best part of the appetizer though are the sauces which are out of this world. They usually come with 3 different sauces that can appeal to basically anyone. If this chain only had these 2 dishes, I would rate it five stars, but then they decided to load their menu to 100 other items, most of which are subpar or ""A-OK"" Service wise this is a rather large restaurant and I would have to admit, the servers were relatively attentive compared to what I would come to expect from a Cheesecake factory. Then again, we came around lunch time when it wasn't so busy, so I would be careful about coming at dinner. My experiences with Cheesecake factory is they value quantity over quality which ultimately results in lackluster food an poor service. Tried the cheesecake as well.

We were very excited to eat some greets cheesecake and were not let down!  There was plenty of seating and there is actually direct access to the restaurant from the outside of Destiny, which is a rarity. We were seated immediately and our waiter told us she has tried everything on the menu, which must have take forever since there are so so may cheesecake options. She was extremely nice and helpful to anyone who needed help deciding between a few cake options.

14,Jared B.,"Raleigh, NC",258,70,466.0,4.0,2015-03-23,"The Cheesecake Factory lives up to expectations. There's been a lot of hype around The Cheesecake Factory. And whenever I breeze by at the mall, there always seems to be a long wait outside. This Sunday, I gave lunch a try. The Cheesecake Factory is located in the new wing of DestinyUSA. It's a lot like the other franchises I've been to: the brightly lit dining room's gaudy interior is a modern take on the 1920's. Separated by a glass divider, a busy kitchen runs along the interior wall, visible to the entire room. The service was fast and polite. Our waitress was quick to take our order, and many members of the staff brought us our food to us. The menu is huge, mostly made up of American and European favorites: small plates, chopped salads, pizza, sandwiches, burgers, pastas, and an array of meat entrees. There's a ""Skinnylicious"" menu, which features a selection of items from the regular menu, made slimmer through smaller portions and healthier ingredients. I was stoked to see a large selection of gluten free items, including bread and buns for the sandwiches and burgers. I ordered the turkey burger. The Cheesecake Factory is famous for building its meals from scratch, and it shows. The burger was fresh in juiciness, texture, and taste. They incorporated a flavorful medley of seasonings into the patty (coriander and cumin, I think). The chefs topped my burger with caramelized onion, and sandwiched it into a gluten-free bun that was big and soft (a rare treat). I ordered sweet potato fries for my side and they were served crisp and tasty. The prices are on the high side for Syracuse (I could get a turkey burger at a lot of other establishments for a few dollars less). But, I wasn't robbed: they clearly work with quality ingredients, and that's where I found the value. It's blasphemous, I know, but I didn't get cheesecake. I'm just not a cheesecake guy.

46,Casey K.,"Syracuse, NY",33,6,,5.0,2015-04-12,"Absolutely delicious! Let's get one thing out of the way; things can get expensive here, and getting a bunch of drinks is a sure way to ramp up your bill. The good news? That's the only negative I've found. I'm a huge fan of steaks, so it's not easy to blow me away; I didn't expect Cheesecake Factory to be the place to do so. Lo and behold, this steak was out of this world! I got a ribeye with fresh seasoned green beans on the side. The veggies were on point; hot, steamy, crispy and full of flavor. Expertly steamed. The steak? WOW. I get my steaks medium rare and they nailed it, serving it in a pool of its own hot, delicious juice. It was cooked to perfection, just the right amount of pink. The food was brought out by one of the cheeriest cooks I've ever seen, and our waitress went above and beyond to let us know about the steaks before we bought them. She also put in extra effort to get me just the right whiskey (though at 11 bucks a drink, I hope that's common). The wait was about an hour but as soon as we came back from roaming the mall a bit, our seat was ready to go. The atmosphere is great and we were perfectly comfortable.  Lastly, it wouldn't be a review without mentioning the cheesecake. Absolutely out of this world. I got the traditional slice of cheesecake with strawberries and cream, and it blew me away, the perfect end to my visit. Use caution, though; there are so many types of cheesecake it can be overwhelming, and if you pick something too crazy there's not much of a cheesecake flavor (my friend learned this when he got the Reese's cheesecake). I only mention this because the cheesecake is so great on its own, you don't need to drown it with other flavors. It ran me about 80 bucks total for a damn fine cut of steak, great cheesecake, and two fantastic whiskers (which they didn't skimp out on!) like I mentioned earlier; don't come here if you're on a budget. But if you're looking to splurge, you can't go wrong at the Cheesecake Factory in destiny USA.

Let's get one thing out of the way; things can get expensive here, and getting a bunch of drinks is a sure way to ramp up your bill. The good news? That's the only negative I've found. I'm a huge fan of steaks, so it's not easy to blow me away; I didn't expect Cheesecake Factory to be the place to do so. Lo and behold, this steak was out of this world! I got a ribeye with fresh seasoned green beans on the side. The veggies were on point; hot, steamy, crispy and full of flavor. Expertly steamed. The steak? WOW. I get my steaks medium rare and they nailed it, serving it in a pool of its own hot, delicious juice. It was cooked to perfection, just the right amount of pink. The food was brought out by one of the cheeriest cooks I've ever seen, and our waitress went above and beyond to let us know about the steaks before we bought them. She also put in extra effort to get me just the right whiskey (though at 11 bucks a drink, I hope that's common). The wait was about an hour but as soon as we came back from roaming the mall a bit, our seat was ready to go. The atmosphere is great and we were perfectly comfortable.  Lastly, it wouldn't be a review without mentioning the cheesecake. Absolutely out of this world. I got the traditional slice of cheesecake with strawberries and cream, and it blew me away, the perfect end to my visit. Use caution, though; there are so many types of cheesecake it can be overwhelming, and if you pick something too crazy there's not much of a cheesecake flavor (my friend learned this when he got the Reese's cheesecake). I only mention this because the cheesecake is so great on its own, you don't need to drown it with other flavors. It ran me about 80 bucks total for a damn fine cut of steak, great cheesecake, and two fantastic whiskers (which they didn't skimp out on!) like I mentioned earlier; don't come here if you're on a budget. But if you're looking to splurge, you can't go wrong at the Cheesecake Factory in destiny USA.

The second time was two weeks ago.  We were not greeted for about 3 minutes even though 2 girls were at the front counter. It took a third coming over to seat us. We sat at the table for about 10 minutes and even though 8 or so wait staff walked by us, none stopped at our table. I went to the hostesses and she said someone would come over. After another 5 minutes still no one, so we left. No one on the patio was served either. I contacted the manager and she apologized and sent me a gift card. Very nice.  So we went today. We were greeted promptly and we had a waiter immediately (I didn't say anything about my last visit).  Our drinks took awhile to be served and our waiter apologized. Our calamari came out lightening quick. It was ok, not the best I've had as it was the huge rings..which tend to be more chewy.  My husband ordered the shepard's pie and he said it was great. I ordered the shrimp scampi (traditionally a garlic and butter dish and so written in the menu.  When it came I think I got two different dishes in one.  My shrimp was butterflied and coated in various spices (some spicy).  Needless to say the shrimp was overcooked and when I mixed the noodles in with the shrimp and the little sauce that came with it, it was a hot mess of spice. Nothing like a shrimp scampi. I like spice, but it left a burning sensation on my tongue well after I stopped eating it.  The waiter said it should not have been spicy and offered to make another meal. I did not want to wait. The manager came over and apologized, asked if I wanted another meal (which I did not want to wait) and offered a free slice of cheesecake.  As a side note, I was shocked at how much a mojito cost.. $12.95!! More than a glass of wine.

By 5:15, still no food. Tables around us were seated, ate and left BEFORE the kitchen manager came over to apologize for a server error??? That took him 10 mins from when the server said he was sending the KM to our table. We never asked for a manager so I thought that was odd. After apologizing for the server error,  he offers us a free piece of cheesecake?? Really??? Almost two hours for a meal we never get, and then we're offered A FREE PIECE OF CAKE???  Very poor service and even worse  management ruined a wonderful romantic evening for me. Because of the time we left (height of dinner time) there were waits over an hour at every other restaurant in the area. I went home and had a bowl of soup. Never ever will I eat there again.

It was snowing btw and getting late so I didn't want to stay out too late.  I came around 7:45-8pm. They were definitely busy. It took them about 15 minutes just to get someone to take our to go orders. So as an FYI just go ahead and have a seat and dine in. Ambiance: Definitely casual so don't over dress.  Meal: I ordered the Chicken and Biscuits with rice and a side of broccoli. I sat another 30 minutes waiting on my meal. No one was directing and checking to make sure that the meals were delivered to the customers. So the food obviously was sitting there getting cold. Needless to say my chicken was super bland. No flavor at all. Sweet Treat: I ordered the Red Velvet Cheesecake! This is why they get the 3 stars. Their cheesecake is always superb!!! Hence the name.... There were so many people stopping through to purchase some cheesecake.  Price: I think they are a bit pricey... with tip my total was roughly $28. If my food wasn't bland then it may have been worth it. The Cheesecake Factory has an extensive menu. The menu is so large with a variety of items I'm sure that's possible to find the one or two items that taste super good. For me I think less is better. Maybe focus on a couple of items, make them great and then change up the menu seasonally.

I like to come here because I love the bread and the food is always good. My favorites are the grilled steak tacos and salmon. However the past few times we've come it has taken so long. The first time the manager apologized. The second time we had an entree comped because we were waiting an hour for our food. The last time we were waiting and they kept telling us it was almost ready when... clearly it wasn't. I'm not sure what changed recently but we don't like it anymore.

227,Leigh S.,"Atlanta, United States",2,73,44.0,3.0,2017-05-02,"The Cheesecake Factory is of course your typical chain. Decided that since I was visiting the Destiny USA mall, why not pick up some food to go. It was snowing btw and getting late so I didn't want to stay out too late.  I came around 7:45-8pm. They were definitely busy. It took them about 15 minutes just to get someone to take our to go orders. So as an FYI just go ahead and have a seat and dine in. Ambiance: Definitely casual so don't over dress.  Meal: I ordered the Chicken and Biscuits with rice and a side of broccoli. I sat another 30 minutes waiting on my meal. No one was directing and checking to make sure that the meals were delivered to the customers. So the food obviously was sitting there getting cold. Needless to say my chicken was super bland. No flavor at all. Sweet Treat: I ordered the Red Velvet Cheesecake! This is why they get the 3 stars. Their cheesecake is always superb!!! Hence the name.... There were so many people stopping through to purchase some cheesecake.  Price: I think they are a bit pricey... with tip my total was roughly $28. If my food wasn't bland then it may have been worth it. The Cheesecake Factory has an extensive menu. The menu is so large with a variety of items I'm sure that's possible to find the one or two items that taste super good. For me I think less is better. Maybe focus on a couple of items, make them great and then change up the menu seasonally. If you're in the area or just walking through Destiny USA, stop through and try it for yourself but don't leave without trying out some Cheesecake!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-syracuse?start=20,2.88,3.19,3.19,2.8280000000000003,3.066

Now, I don't eat cheesecake, or really any sweets for that matter and I guess that is the huge selling point for this place. So maybe that's my reason for a lower star review. But here we go on my take on this joint.  First off like I said. Don't come here if you don't want a wait. At least this destiny location. It took me five attempts to get a cramped small table that might as well have been family style and joined with its neighbors. But my wait this time was less than five minutes and I can live with that. The decor was not at all what I expected given my only experience with the Cheesecake Factory is the Big Bang theory. And this looks absolutely nothing like it is on that show. To use the word ostentatious would be an understatement. However it's so busy here that it seems hard for the staff to keep the simple things clean. Like some booths have mirrors covered in fingerprints and there a lots of crumbs on the floors when you're churning out the business this place does. A lull to clean is probably a hard commodity to come by. The seating as I said. In the section I sat in was a long bench booth seat with 5-8 small tables then 5-8 wicker chairs on the opposite side. So close I bumped elbows with my neighbor attempting to leave after eating. If you want to have a private conversation. You won't here.  The menu is pretty intense with a lot of options. But all fall pretty much in line with any other corporate location. A page of apps, a page of burgers, pasta, steaks, sandwiches and so on. And a completely separate one for their wide selection of desserts.  This was a date night for me and the fiancé. And we had a movie after so I didn't want something heavy in my stomach. But loaded tater tots isn't something I could pass on. I'm a sucker for a good potato appetizer. And I also ordered a Cuban sandwich because it's one of my favorites. She got a chicken Marsala pasta dish. I'll give the servers credit. They got each other's backs and everyone helps everyone. And that's great. But I found it weird that they announced their breaks and introduced a new waiter every time. Saw it happening all over the restaurant, But I think that's just me probably that found it weird. But super friendly and helpful and very well trained at their jobs.  The food came out appetizer first and a order of bread on the house. I wasn't super thrilled with the bread but I can always appreciate softened butter when it is served because spreading something right out of a cooler can be a pain. The tots, delicious. And as much as I hate to admit it. Being someone that despises sriracha. Their dipping sauce was also really good as well. So we were off to a good start. The sandwich came next. And Ill say while it's not the real deal Cuban, It's a fair replacement for it. Cuban bread isn't a easy thing to come by in upstate NY they used a chewy crusty odd bread that I wasn't sure what it was exactly that was flattened in a sandwich press. The meat inside was juicy and flavorful though and the mustard and pickles weren't bad either. Not the best ever. But a very far cry from the worse. Fries were also done very well. Not crunchy, nor soft. Sort of right up the middle again. Naomi's Marsala could have stood to have the wine cooked out of it a little more. But the pasta was perfect and again. Right up the middle with the food. If this place was a round of golf. It's definitely shooting par.  Naomi got a banana cream cheesecake slice to go. And as I said. I don't eat the stuff. But it looked tasty enough I that counts. Bill wasn't too awful. If memory serves about 60$ for two people including tip. So all and all an affordable option for a date night.  So I guess my general consensus of this place is what I expected going in. My socks still firmly on my feet. Not blown off, but my stomach full and happy. My experience with Cheesecake is par for the course. I'd come again, but definitely on like a Wednesday afternoon when I might be able to hear myself think.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-syracuse,3.08,3.13,3.13,2.668,3.11

I chose to eat there over a ton of other restaurants.. we went early, 3:30. I had to ask for the bread and butter every other table was given when they were given their beverage order. By 5:15, still no food. Tables around us were seated, ate and left BEFORE the kitchen manager came over to apologize for a server error??? That took him 10 mins from when the server said he was sending the KM to our table. We never asked for a manager so I thought that was odd. After apologizing for the server error,  he offers us a free piece of cheesecake?? Really??? Almost two hours for a meal we never get, and then we're offered A FREE PIECE OF CAKE???  Very poor service and even worse  management ruined a wonderful romantic evening for me. Because of the time we left (height of dinner time) there were waits over an hour at every other restaurant in the area. I went home and had a bowl of soup. Never ever will I eat there again.

205,Stefan F.,"Boston, United States",0,20,26.0,3.0,2017-12-13,"Waited almost a half hour to be seated despite plenty of open tables out on the patio. Had the option to eat at the bar but there wasn't adequate seating and the noise level was unpleasant. Ordered a large garden salad that was delicious with the cilantro dressing!  When the White Bean Chicken Chili was delivered the server stated ""be careful it's hot"" and the dish bowl was however, the chili was warm and some of the chunks of chicken were not. Sent it back and it was delivered piping hot (of course) and it was a very tasty dish. Waitress didn't ask if I was interested in dessert which I was somewhat surprised by, not to mention no sincere apology for the barely warm chili.  The food is usually tasty but pricey and this was the first time I've ever had to send a dish from this chain back. I guess I'll go to the counter and get my own cheesecake now!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-syracuse,3.0,3.02,3.02,,3.0120000000000005
