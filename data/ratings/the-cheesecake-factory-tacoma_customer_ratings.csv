53,David B.,"Brentwood, CA",23,15,,5.0,2016-12-06,"Made it to opening day today (12/6) and I am definitely impressed with the attentiveness and professionalism on otherwise a hectic day. When I got there I was greeted multiple times and informed them that I was on a lunch break from work and only had 45min to get in and out and if it was even possible for that to happen. The front desk made sure to ask around for me before giving an answer and ensured me that I wouldn't have to worry.  Fast forward to my meal. I ordered the Macaroni and Cheese Burger and a water. I can not express enough how many times they made sure I was good on water. This is perfect! I am someone who drinks my water fast and usually am stuck awkwardly asking for more. I can't appreciate enough that this was something they were able to accommodate on such a busy day. On top of that, my meal came out within 15-20min, cooked to perfection. They entertained us with the best oven baked bread while waiting, which made my wait go by quickly. Lastly, the check. I did have to ask for my check, which is ok as I was socializing with others and they would periodically check in to make sure I was alright and it was my fault for consistently saying no, so I'm sure they took it as a hint of some kind. They made sure the minute I asked for it to promptly get it to my table, as they remembered I was on lunch break. That was a small detail to remember, but definitely made me feel like they were listening. Long story short, I will be here again. I am thoroughly impressed with this establishment, especially on opening day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tacoma?start=40,3.0920000000000005,3.0920000000000005,3.0920000000000005,3.0920000000000005,3.092000000000001
57,Syn M.,"Tacoma, WA",1,32,13.0,5.0,2016-12-06,"UPDATE: 3/5 goes to 5/5 after our shortcake took forever the manager personally brought it, apologized, and took it off our bill. Great customer service and the short cake was amazing.  Opening day is as hectic and chaotic as you could imagine but I think the staff did amazing for how much foot traffic there was. Our server was polite but very busy so not as attentive as they should have been but still overall no complaints. The food wait was a little long especially out dessert which took over 25 minutes to come out for shortcake. After voicing my opinion someone assured me it was coming out and that they were behind. Hold on the lemonades because they are super sweet I had to dilute it with my water.

In all honesty, I expect their system to be a bit out of place but to my surprise they were very professional and attentive. The people and staffs there made the place feels more alive than ever which is always a plus.  The food are great though the only thing I saw that could be better is the sourdough bread that was served before other dishes and how it could've been a little softer and warmer.  I also LOVE LOVE LOVE their orange juice. Why? Because it is fresh squeeze as you order which takes longer time but I didn't mind the wait for it because the staffs took their time to make sure their customers receive the best quality food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tacoma?start=20,2.772,2.772,2.772,2.772,2.7720000000000002

153,DeAnna C.,"Vancouver, WA",103,25,3.0,3.0,2016-12-10,They are new and our wait staff was pretty bad. The guy helping the waitress took my drink and did not bring it back. Our waitress was attentive till we got our food. Then she just disappeared and we stopped existing to her. She took people besides us order with out a glance in our direction. I understand they are busy but there was tons of staff probably 20-30 visible staff. So there really was no excuse. The manager did apologize and made it right. As it was tip time we got a sarcastic half hearted apology from the waitress and attitude. She seemed to not care that she was in the wrong. The food was amazing and the other staff was amazing. A busser heard us talking about where our waitress was and quickly alerted the proper people and we were taken care of. I say wait a bit till the bad staff is weeded out. Then you will have the service Cheesecake Factory is known for.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tacoma?start=100,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444
113,David T.,"Baguio, Philippines",0,24,2.0,5.0,2016-12-11,"Woo hoo! Used to go to Cheesecake Factory in San Diego, so I was so excited when they announced that they would be putting one up here. First of all, lets cover the cons. They got rid of popcorn shrimp for appetizers, but they still got the crab cakes. Serving time for the usual bread at the start was really long, but I understand that they just opened up and are trying to set everything up. Besides that, everything else is excellent! I was worried that they would give smaller portions because I noticed they do that as time went on at the last Cheesecake Factory I went to, but actually, they are pretty generous portions--I mean, there's not like a butt load, but even for me who needs to eat 2 subway footlongs to get full, the entree portions are pretty filling. The servers are courteous, and the customers don't trash the restrooms like uncivilized monkeys. Tasteful music, and great atmosphere. A small suggestion would be to light it up a bit because it was a bit too dark, but besides that, great decor and temperature control inside.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tacoma?start=120,2.58,2.58,2.58,2.58,2.58

After waiting more than an hour, we asked how much longer? We were then told it would be more than an hour wait! Okay...so what happened to it being less than two hours? They said it was because there was another big party! After they eat then we would be seated! Seriously!?! What a way to celebrate my birthday! We ended up just leaving! Not sure if this place will work out! I called to make sure  and even asked if it was over crowded...was then told it was not!!

Well I have to say that the dishes don't impress me much. All the dishes have a sweet taste to them and also plain like the kitchen forget their salt portion today. The 3 stars review is for how nice the manager was and also the serve we had. Even though I got the wrong choice of meat for my dish in the beginning, the serve offered me a side of shrimp for free and kept checking on us if we was doing fine. However the food is really disappointed. I have this same dish in 3 different Cheesecake factory locations and more than 15 times, but this location made it so much different and I'm not a fan of it. We also had 2 orders of steak and shrimp and both dishes are plain with a weird taste of sweetness. The salmon is good though only that wont bringing me back.

But this particular location is poorly organized, very slow, and inconsiderate of the needs of their guest. My husband and I came here for dinner and were willing to wait the ""50 minutes"" for seats because we knew the food and drinks would be well worth it especially after a long week of work. After over an hour past and it was our time to be sat, the poorly trained hostess walked us all the way around the restaurant, missing our seat, and then noticed that our booth had been ""double booked"". We walked back to the front where she was told to sit us elsewhere. Once we arrived and the new seats I noticed the discomfort on my husbands face. How was he at 220lbs 6 feet supposed to fit in such a small space? I asked to be sat at the empty booth across the aisle instead. She leaves us standing, goes back to the front and shortly returns with our denied request and informs us that if we wish to sit somewhere else we will have to wait the line again. At that point we left.

Similar quality as at other Cheesecake factories. The only negatives, when opening and entering from mall,  you walk thru the bar. Becomes quite smooshed. The other negative was an employee,  we figured out, who constantly is walking thru the tables and didn't interact. Felt creepy.

51,Louise E.,"Tacoma, WA",263,46,46.0,2.0,2016-12-20,"The only reason I'm giving this place a 2-star rating is because I understand that some policies are probably enforced company wide. That being said, I had to wait about 2 hours tonight bc I had a large party (15 people). My family's original meet up time was 6pm but when the hostess said that they would be more likely able to get us at the tables at 6:30-6:45pm-ish, obviously we had to accommodate. Some of my family members were coming from both sides after work PLUS TRAFFIC so even though I had agreed for a 6:30pm ""reservation,"" it would make sense that some of us would be a couple of minutes late, right? NOPE. I knew TCF only takes reservations in person so I planned accordingly since I worked the closest to the area. I ended up waiting for about two hours, as I previously mentioned, only to be told by a manager that they would need the majority of my group in order to keep all of our tables within 10 minutes of my requested ""reservation"". There were seven of us present, she needed 10. I explained that some of my members were really close (2 had just parked and the others were coming up to the traffic light) and tried to ask if she can give me a bit more time - just five extra minutes - to which she said, ""But you told us 6:30pm."" Thankfully the other hostess manage to talk to her and let us have all the tables. This wouldn't have been such a big issue if I had been told about this when I had initially put my name down. Our [first] waitress was friendly but it was odd when she seemed to have left us after she had taken down all of our drink orders. She would be coming by here and there throughout our dinner, but we mostly had two other girls checking in on us. It was nice that she came around our group twice to insure she got the right orders for the right person. Though, odd when she apparently got some orders wrong. Noticing other big groups, it just seemed so chaotic regarding which servers are waiting on which tables.  When I first heard that the Cheesecake Factory do not take any reservations other than in- person, I immediately made a choice not to come here or any other locations on my own. After experiencing this again first-hand, I shall stick to that decision but only agree to come for family and friends.  I understand that this may be all part of their company policy, but I wish the customer service - especially from a manager - was better. I thank all the people that helped us tonight for being so patient with such a large group that also divided up the checks. I ordered a combination of the shrimp scampi and chicken (something). The scampi part didn't come with any pasta noodles. I had asked the waitress if it would have any noodles just bc as a stand-alone dish, the scampi did come with the noodles. The waitresses said yes but NOPE! Disappointed after that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tacoma?start=40,2.056,2.056,2.056,2.056,2.056

With that being said I feel like some people need to just give this place a little more credit. My husband and I went today and we had a great experience. The servers are obviously trying to get a hang of things but you can tell that they are really trying. Our waitress was very nice. Forgot one or two things but it wasn't a big deal to us. The food was classic Cheesecake Factory a.k.a. delicious. My one tip would be to make sure that you stay close. When we checked in we were told that it'd be a 40 minute wait but to start making your way back in about 25 minutes if you head into the mall (the buzzer only reaches so far). We ended up coming back after about 20 minutes and I asked if they had called our name yet and they had just called it.

Also, I was seated in the booth in the back closest to the kitchen, I counted at least 7 dishes being sent back during my outrageously long wait for my horrible food. To top off this ""great"" experience, I witnessed the manger totally mistreat our server. She messed up on someone's tab, and the manager corrected her so rudely in front of everyone.

Both pasta dishes were overly salty, in fact.  Our waitress did an excellent job taking the dish back to the kitchen to be remade without making us feel bad about it, but even when the kitchen remade the Shrimp Scampi, it was still pretty salty. It's like the kitchen had taken a cup of salt and poured it in with the pasta while it boiled. We couldn't finish our plates and ended up leaving shortly after, $50 lighter and stomachs still mostly empty.

The waitress was very friendly and attenitive to our needs. The main corse came shortly after and the water glass was always full. I ordered the Cajun Chicken Littles and the fiance ordered the Eggplant Parmesian Pasta. Both were equally delicious in their own special way. The Chicken Littles AKA fried chicken tenders were fried just right. Crunchy and not very greasy  at all. They were complimented nicely by a mountain of mashed potatoes with two sauces for dipping (Honey mustard and BBQ sauce) and a side of freshly steamed veggies.

I ordered the mushroom cheeseburger with a vinaigrette salad on my first visit...it was easily the best cheeseburger I've ever eaten, and I've eaten a lot. For dessert I took a very generous slice of lemon meringue cheesecake home. Yum! This 2nd visit I had to have another mushroom burger, but with fries this time. It's that good.

140,Nick B.,"Huntsville, AL",0,1,,2.0,2017-01-02,"To begin with, I will preface this review with the fact I've been in the industry for close to a decade. (Management). The hosts originally told us that it would be between 60-80 minutes for a table (Monday night at 7:30pm.), we were sat within 40. Not to say this is necessarily a bad thing, but in most cases this initial embellished timeframe would have turned us to another restaurant. Our server approached our table within 10 seconds of us being seated and began pressing us for an order.(not attentive service but an impatient Denny's type of style) After her 3rd visit inside of 3 minutes we placed a drink order that she promptly forgot and returned to ask us to repeat. After taking this 4 drink order (that took 10 minutes to reach our table), during which time another waitress came over to give another confusing greeting only to inform us that she was  helping our server. This appetizer order turned out to be unavailable. After placing a children's order ahead of our main food order, this was also bungled leaving off the ""chicken"" that we had clearly asked for on the chicken quesodillo. The main order took quite a while to receive only to leave off the two things we asked specifically for. Not a big deal considering the side nature of the requests. However the fish and chip meal that one of our party ordered was comprised of tiny pieces of what appeared to be mostly batter. The side of fries we ordered for our son were uneatable (actually thought I broke a tooth on the first one, with the other half a dozen we sampled almost equally as bad). One of the beers we ordered was a Tacoma IPA that tasted as if something were fouled in the line. This was my fiance's first visit to a cheesecake factory and we had raved about the menus, service and ambiance. What we were treated to was a grossly incompetent server who must have cheated on her server training to get on the floor that very day, and an overall experience that shuffled us out the door without bothering to get the cheesecake desert that I had been pining for from the outset. On a redeeming note, my Lua salad was scrumptious and should be commended.

123,Shelley R.,"Tacoma, WA",13,1,,1.0,2017-01-04,"My daughter wanted to come to the Cheesecake Factory for a belated birthday dinner on January 1st. Our entire little family would be there--my daughter, my son (who was home from college), my husband, and myself. I suspected that the Tacoma restaurant didn't take reservations since the Seattle one didn't, so I called them to explain my situation. My daughter is 25 and has autism. She is very sensitive to loud sudden noises and the confusion that often occurs in a crowd, but is usually okay once seated at a table. I asked the first person I spoke with if we could make a reservation for a time that it would be convenient for the restaurant because if my daughter got set off by a loud noise, we wouldn't be able to stay (it is not pleasant when a 25-year-old has a temper tantrum and starts throwing things). I explained that I was asking for a reasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act, and that I noticed that the restaurant was aware of some disabilities as they had braille menus available. The young man who answered the phone just kept repeating, ""We don't make reservations."" I asked politely to talk with the manager. A woman came on the phone. She said that she didn't think making a reservation would be a problem given our situation, but that a manager would have to approve it. Then a young man came to the phone and said he was the manager. He said, ""I can't make a reservation, but I can seat you and your daughter at the first available table."" I said, ""Great! But there are four of us."" He said, ""I can only make an accommodation for you and your daughter."" Since he sounded as though English wasn't his first language, I explained again that we were a family of four and we were celebrating our daughter's birthday. He then repeated that he could make an accommodation for my daughter and me. Every time I reminded him that there were four of us, not two, he said he could make an accommodation for the two of us. I explained that wasn't an accommodation because there were four of us. He kept repeating the same statement, word for word, over and over again--at least six times. Needless to say, we didn't go there for dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tacoma?start=140,2.24,2.24,2.24,2.468,2.24

157,Anny T.,"Tacoma, WA",0,8,,3.0,2017-01-13,"All the times I've been to cheesecake factory, I've had a pretty good experience, fast service, fairly seating, delicious food.  All locations, especially Tacoma needs a better seating area! There is only 1 small bench to sit for customers! I've ate at the Bellevue location, Southcenter, and now this will be my 4th time at the Tacoma location since they've opened.  This last experience was not well at all! We went out last night on Thursday (1/12/2017), figured it wouldn't be that busy to take out our friend here for their 1st time eating at this restaurant.  We arrived there at 6:30pm, there was a small group of people waiting to be seated (about 4 groups, compared to the other weeknights we've been going to the Tacoma location).  There were 5 girls at the hostesses stand: 1 African American, 2 white girls (blonde & Brunette), 2 Asian girls (1 must've been the manager - she had keys around her wrist & wore a different color top). 2 girls faced us when we approached the stand (blonde & brunette); we were told that the wait would be 20minutes by the long brunette haired hostess, which was fine for us since the waiting crowd wasn't large.   People that were there before us were getting seated, and it was about 45minutes of waiting until we asked if we were skipped.  The blonde hostess couldn't find us in the system and realized that our buzzer never got clocked in.  She told us that we'd be seated at the next available table. 1 family got sat after we were told we'd be next (which was fine because it was just 1 party), but then 5 more people were getting seated! I understand they're going through the buzzer system, but if we had been skipped and were told we'd be seated at the next available table, then we should've been sat! I saw that the blonde hostesses kept telling her coworkers to seat our party next, but the other hostesses kept skipping through us, grabbing the other buzzers, printing out the slips with customer's name - taking the other people. I can tell the blonde was getting a little frustrated with everyone else not listening to her, so she personally went to go set our table and sat us there (which we appreciate, but we were still very annoyed).  We literally waited almost an hour before getting seated! When it wasn't even busy when we got in! I understand when this restaurant is extremely busy, but seriously Tacoma needs to figure it out.  Southcenter gets packed like crazy, but their seating time is quick for always being busy.  Hostesses need to figure out this buzzer system and actually clock the buzzer in instead of handing it off to customers.  There needs to be more hostesses or something, because all I saw was the 1 Asian hostess being the one seating majority of the customers, rushing back to the hostess stand after each seating.  Blonde was in charge most of the time for handing off the buzzers (except for us the Brunette handed us ours), the black & brunette girls stood around wiping the menus, not even helping seating customers when there were people waiting.  Manager would come and go from the hostess stand, not sure what she was doing.

I have had tons terrible servers in the Tacoma/Seattle area, and it seems hard to find a decent one, but Connie provided stellar service and is very friendly. The 3 people working the hostess station are worthless. During our 40 minute wait a manager kept coming up to them and telling them of open tables. We saw one empty for almost 20 minutes. Then when we saw an open booth right next the table they wanted to sit us at, the hostess had to check with front to make sure it was okay.

I ordered the Sweet Corn Tamale appetizer, and it arrived nearly cold and the cakes lacked texture. The dinner, a combination plate with steak and chicken, was just OK, as the chicken had some fatty spots and lacked flavor. We had two different servers, one who was on the ball, the other, not so much. And the music is WAY TOO LOUD. In a crowded restaurant like that with the noise level already high, pop music screeching from speakers just makes everyone have to shout to be heard. My throat was actually sore by the time I left. One thing they really do right, of course, is the cheesecake. I had the Red Velvet, and it was phenomenal.

At least once a month we go to Tukwila just to have their avocado eggrolls and a slice of strawberry cheesecake. It's a wonderful treat and something my girlfriends and I look forward too. Naturally when it was time to choose a restaurant for my Bachelorette Party - I called the new Cheesecake factory in Tacoma! I have made reservations for Cheesecake Factory in Tukwila, Hawaii, Belleuve, Tigard, Florida and all over the US while traveling. I love the ability to make reservations as they are always so busy. The hostess rudely told me that they do not take reservations. When I said ""we are coming in with a party of 14 and I do not want to overwhelm you, are you able to at least note that we are coming in?"" She said ""just send someone in two hours early to let us know and wait for you. WHAT?!? That's absurd. I called BJ's that is right next door - they happily took my reservation and had a table waiting for me.  The day of the party, before going to BJ's, I stopped and looked in at Cheesecake factory just to see if they could accommodate 14 at the last minute (since reservations did not work). 95% of the tables were empty with three girls standing around just chatting at the desk. When I asked how long the wait was for 14 - she said ""approx 90 minutes"" without evening looking. She then turned around and continued chatting with the other two girls, something about their boyfriend not liking a sexual position. We walked out and will not be returning to this location.

The Sunday brunch menu is ample and the eggs benny is grand. The food at the Tacoma location lives up to the legend but alas, the service does not. The hostess was moderately warm when I told her I would like to sit at the bar. The issue was with the bar staff and supporting bar staff. I got to listen to personal stories of each as they shared their personal lives with each other while I waited for my food. Very inappropriate and unprofessional. What was worse is the fact that there was absolutely no anticipation of my needs as a patron. Always had to ask for coffee refill and food was brought to me without forethought of what I would need with the meal. For example, butter with the waffle, salt and pepper, extra syrup, etc. Being young and inexperienced is no excuse for this kind of service.

He said dinner was on them that night and asked if I wanted anything else. Said we were planning on getting a slice of cheesecake.

16,Linda J.,"Seattle, WA",71,279,75.0,3.0,2017-03-09,"So to be honest, I was scared to eat here after reading all of the negative reviews. I decided to risk it because I don't eat meat so I thought, how sick could I get (worst case scenario)? I should preface my review by saying that I've waited tables before so I'm a little more understanding (and also a little more discerning) than most patrons.   Upon entering the restaurants, I received friendly greetings from smiling faces. It wasn't long before our waiter came over and took our beverage orders and asked if we wanted bread. The drinks came pretty promptly.  I was catching up with my friend so I didn't pay close attention, but I'd gone through the whole wheat bread by myself (don't judge) and waited for a while before our meals came out. She ordered a salad and I'd ordered a veggie burger... It probably shouldn't have taken that long since I eat food very slowly (especially since I otherwise don't eat bread). Our waiter was attentive and had pretty good timing as far as asking if everything was okay, etc... Right away I noticed that my food was about room temperature. Not good. It was borderline and I hadn't seen our waiter for a while so I started eating. Again, there was no meat involved and I was hungry. I don't remember anyone coming by to refill our waters (though I'm not sure hers needed refilling).  I eventually told our waiter that my meal was lukewarm and I'd like him to relay that message to the manager. I also told him that I'd read a lot of reviews on Yelp about the lukewarm food situation. I didn't want to be a pain and told him as much... I did not pressure him to redo my order because we were already done eating and I could easily reheat it when I got home. Other than the temperature of my food, it tasted pretty good. The portion was huge which made me feel like I got my money's worth. I've never seen a veggie burger patty that big so there's something to be said about that. However, the more I thought about it the more it bothered me that he didn't insist on redoing it or getting the manager for me. I can only imagine it was a server in training that came with him to bring us our bill and my friend ordered a few pieces of cheesecake to go. When she came back I told her the same thing I'd told our waiter. I admitted that I told him he didn't HAVE to worry about it but I'd wished he'd offered to rectify the situation. She was very apologetic and gave me an eta on remaking my burger. I thanked her and the manager came over to address my concerns. She too was apologetic and said that they have new kitchen staff and they are still trying to find their rhythm, etc... Not really a valid excuse or one that should be offered to patrons, but I don't imagine there's anything she could say that would make sense. The server in training wrapped back around with us and apologized again. I really do hope that the cooks get it together because this place has potential. It would be a shame for the waitstaff to suffer due to circumstances beyond their control. I gave three stars because in the end it was handled well and attitude goes a long way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tacoma,2.52,2.52,2.52,2.508,2.52

128,Leslie B.,"Federal Way, WA",0,6,,2.0,2017-03-21,"My family of four came here for my daughter's 21st birthday.  The food was good and the waitstaff was extra friendly.  We had several drinks between us.  When the bill came, it was around $250.00!  I have never spent that much at a restaurant before, except at the Met Grill !  I am upset that the drink prices are not listed on the menu.  I expected they were probably around $8 a piece, especially since we sat in the bar.  Found out afterwards that they were $12!  Unbelievable!  We kept ordering because the drinks were SO weak and watered down. My last drink was a Long Island Iced Tea. After about 2 sips, my family noticed that there was clear liquid left in the glass, pure water.  My daughter received a Margarita in a small martini glass. WTH? To top things off, we told the waiter that it was her birthday. They brought her choice of cheesecake with her name written in chocolate on the plate, a candle, and a birthday song. Nice touch. I was shocked to see that they charged us for it!  With the prices you charge, could you at least have comped the birthday cheesecake?  And, we obviously fell for the trick that you made watered down drinks so that we paid for more. Could have picked anywhere else for dinner, and next time we will.  Your food is decent and the staff is friendly, but you are not a five star restaurant.  Should be a little more budget friendly. Next time if we come back, we will go elsewhere for the drinks!  Disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tacoma?start=140,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.3760000000000003,2.44
29,J C.,"Seattle, WA",2,49,2.0,1.0,2017-03-23,"I have been to this location twice. Both times my order came out burnt/overcooked. The first time I was dining inside and had to ask to have the order sent back. The server claimed it was overcooked because I wanted it pretty plain (factory nachos. I just wanted chicken, cheese and sour cream). I told him every other time I've ordered it it's been good. Wanting a smaller amount of toppings should not mean it's overcooked. No money was taken off my bill even though it took them another 20 minutes to remake the nachos.  Against my better judgment I returned to this location for a curbside to go order with the factory nachos. I should've checked the order before I left as when I got home and opened the box I found the nachos burnt. It was much worse than my first order was. Most of the chicken was inedible with lots of char and the consistency of leather.  It is absolutely unacceptable that orders are sent out to customers when they are clearly burnt. I would recommend that customers go elsewhere until this location trains their cooks how to make orders correctly. They also need to train their servers to not blame customers when an order is burnt.

Shortly after our orders were taken, they switched servers so one could go on a break.  I appreciated that they came to let us know, but they tried to run off so quickly, I had to raise my voice to get one of them back to the table - I asked for the lemon that was forgotten with my tea. After that, the service just became lackluster.  The lemon never arrived and I gave up on asking for it a third time.  Drink refills were ignored.  There just wasn't much attention to the table - it seemed like the servers - both of them - had some friends at a table near us and were busy being sociable with them. In all, not the end of the world.  The food was still tasty and I'll be back for more - maybe the service is better during the day when it's impossible to get a table without taking a nap in your car while you wait.  Only major complaint?  BRING BACK THE CARAMEL CHICKEN.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tacoma?start=20,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.476,2.44

The chopped salad was actually very good, but I was a little disappointed with the pasta; It was very bland and the chicken was very tough.  It's the Cheesecake Factory so of course we ordered us some cheesecake, and they were okay.  The only thing I didn't like is that there is no structure regarding the waiting line.

Some days the servers are knowledgeable and fast, and other days it takes almost an hour to get your food-and you can definitely tell it's been under the hot window.  Normally you can't go wrong with any dish here, but on any given day the same dish is different! Chicken Marsala is my favorite dish, for example. Sometimes it comes with parsley and you are offered freshly grated cheese, other times it's chicken and pasta with barely any sauce. Some times you get sourdough and sweet bread, sometimes they are out of one.  I'm hoping that they hire more servers or continue with their training since the location is so new.

My daughter and her family have been visiting from North Carolina and we wanted to have such a dinner there tonight. We chose a Monday evening because we know how crazy busy the place is on weekends. We had never eaten at the Tacoma location, so I called early afternoon to see if we needed to make special arrangements for a larger party. There were to be 9 of us; 6 adults and 3 children. I was told over the phone that they don't do call ahead seating and it is strictly walk in. We decided since that was the case to make it an early dinner just to be safe. We arrived at 4:25 and put our name in for a table. We were told they'd have to get a manager to come let us know how long the wait would be. There were many empty tables in the establishment and not that many people waiting to be seated. After waiting several minutes, we assumed everything was fine and even took the kids over to see all the delicious cheesecakes on display. They were excited about dessert! At 4:55, which was 30 minutes later, a manager came up and told us that if we all wanted to be seated together it would be an hour to an hour and a half wait!

5,Jizelle O.,"Orange, CA",1411,151,1269.0,4.0,2017-06-14,"Based off cheesecake alone because I only went here for dessert, ON POINT! The cake, the icing, the crust, and presentation was all amazing. From the first bite to the last it was just all delicious. I have lost all control of what went in my mouth...what is a diet anyways?  From carrot cake cheesecake to peanut butter cup to red velvet to Oreo, they've got it all. They even have the basic plain cheesecake in ""low fat"" options, and it's one of the only slices they offer under 1000 calories! Well worth it though, I would run a few miles for some of their cake.  No lie, it was pricey but then again it's the Cheesecake Factory so go figure. I paid $20 (including tax and tip) for two slices. My poor wallet!

We asked for new eggs and it took around 20 minutes to get them, after she had finished the other part of her meal and I had finished mine. The manager came to us several times apologizing, but honestly remaking eggs should have taken just a few minutes but took drastically longer. Our meal was comped but the near two hours we spent there was already gone, and we were overly irritated. The best part was that they weren't even busy, normally there is a line at this location but we were seated immediately.

If so, it means I had raw meat in my mouth (did not know about the paper until I ate it).  They took the meal off the check, that was fine.  We decided to try it again about a week later, and it was an even worse experience. My kids and I got our meals, but they didn't bring my husband's. My kids both ordered the buttered noodles and both came overcooked and hard and I don't know how they could not have seen it. We asked for replacements. My meal sat and got cold because I wasn't going to eat in front of my family when they had nothing. The 2 replacement noodles came out and one of them had some other food on it, something orange!  And my husband's burger was small, about half the size of his bun.

My son who wasn't with us the first time wanted to try it out so we came back for a second visit. Our service was amazing and most of the food was good. Yesterday was our third visit and our last visit. We came in a little after 2pm and were seated right away, surprisingly enough as there is usually a wait. That's when everything went downhill. Our server came over dropped off some bread, said she would be back with some water and left, we didn't even get the chance to order an actual drink. Fast forward to 20/25 minutes later our server returns, drops off the water, I say we'd like to order some fries and some drinks (we were waiting for 2 other people). Another person dropped off our fries and our server and our drinks were nowhere to be found again. Another 10/15 minutes go by and finally our server found her way to our table, with our drinks. I was clearly upset by this point. For the cheesecake factory, they really weren't busy and I found the service completely unacceptable. At this point our server went ghost, she was nowhere to be seen or found. I eventually went to the front were I asked for a manager, his name was Paul and truth be told, he didn't seem to make anything better. He got a round of drinks quickly for our table, and that was it. When our server finally did show back up we placed our cheesecake order and that took a solid 20+ minutes, for 5 slices of cheesecake. We were so irritated we just wanted to leave. There was no discount, no compensation, no nothing. I told Paul how bad the service was and how long we were waiting, and waiting, and waiting, he clearly didn't care either. We paid our bill, and left. My husband went back in to speak to a manager, but was told by the girl at the front that they were understaffed and a manager was unavailable.

So we went to BJ's instead, no big deal.  We decided that we would just grab a slice of cheesecake on our way out. I approached the counter to ask about ordering a slice and I was told that I could order it down on the right side. (No one was at this part of the counter). So myself and another lady waited for someone to return, which took about ten minutes. After placing my order, I watched the girl filling orders get pretty overwhelmed, having to basically beg a server to get someone to help her. I saw what looked like a plain strawberry cheesecake with no whipped cream and extra strawberries sitting on the back counter near the espresso machine. I then watched people come to help out behind the counter, every single one of which ignored the slice sitting, boxed, on the counter for 15 minutes. I watched multiple people move it to the side and ignore a boxed slice of cheesecake sitting on the back counter.  One of the women helping finally asked if I had been waiting for something. I told her and it was resolved. I left and the woman whom ordered before still hadn't gotten her cheesecake.  It just seems a bit crazy to me to wait 25 minutes for a slice of cheesecake. I understand busy as a former server and barista, but watching that many people look over food sitting on the back counter (that must be boxed for some reason) was pretty ridiculous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tacoma?start=80,2.68,2.65,2.65,2.216,2.662

7,Jen L.,"Tacoma, WA",5,4,,2.0,2017-11-20,"I went to the cheesecake factory last weekend and was really disappointed in my experience. We waited 45 minutes or so for a table - which we normally wouldn't have done but they told my husband 30 and we were able to get our shopping completed ... so we waited for another 15 in line .. which wouldn't have been a big deal but we have a 4-year-old and a two-year-old .. we probably should have just left at that point, but we didn't have enough foresight.  Upon being seated, we ordered our drinks and an appetizer. The drinks took a while to get back to us, and when the server appeared with them, she asked if we thought about any appetizers. She forgot to put the order in. So we decided to skip it, since the kids were hungry at that point.  We ordered 2 salads, some apps and 2 kids meals. My husband's salad came right out, and they told me mine would be out soon. It wasn't, and after I was able to flag the waitress down and ask where my salad was, she said our food would be right out too. I wanted to eat my salad, and not be crowded for space at our little table, so they brought the salad out to me and said they could hold the food.  When they brought the food, the avocado toast we'd ordered was browning and the toast was soggy. My daughter's meatball was raw - not pink - RAW. We asked for a new order of spaghetti + meatballs since it was raw ... they went and cooked the same order longer, and brought it back out (on a very hot plate that a 4-year-old shouldn't touch). It was still undercooked, but at this point, she was so hungry, so she ate some pasta and part of the meatball that was cooked.  They brought the food to us on incredibly hot plates - leading me to believe they just let our food sit in the hot window while I ate my salad that they forgot to bring to me. AT the VERY least they should have swapped out the plates for the kids to be on dishes that wouldn't hurt them to touch. They should have re-made the avocado toast because it was gross. And then especially after serving a raw meatball to us, and after I let them know it was still not totally cooked and that no, we didn't want to take it home and that she was not going to finish the uncooked portion that they should have at the very least taken the kids meal off of the bill.  Our waitress was busy and not attentive, and we had a sub-par experience. After dropping off the bill, she was nowhere to be found so I could pay for this whole thing and leave. My husband had to take the kids (who were so done with being there after this whole long ordeal) to the car while I waited. And finally, the host who sat us initially finally took my check.  The manager's lack of care around the raw meatball served to my daughter, and the lack of care of the food they served us and the terrible service will make me think at least twice before returning to this location.  Mistakes happen (we'd been served raw chicken at this location once before - seems like they happen here a lot) but the way in which a manager or server handles hte situation is what makes me decide to go back or not, and I'm incredibly disappointed at the way they handled this!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tacoma,2.52,2.66,2.66,,2.604

She ignored my question and just took my order. So I get there the girl ringing me up was very nice. I got my food went home and started eating it only to notice after my second bite that there was a piece of hair from someone's beard in my food I could not eat anymore after that so my $20 was wasted  this was my experience and I won't be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tacoma?start=40,2.64,2.66,2.66,,2.652

A few weeks ago I went with my boyfriend's family and we had ordered desserts after our meals, we were so busy talking that we didn't even realize that our desserts were taking longer than expected. After 20 minutes or so, the waitress came and apologized profusely and had her manager come and give us a gift card for the wait although we told her we didn't mind. She took responsibility for the wait and honestly made the situation 10x better! Her professionalism and kind personality have definitely earned them a loyal customer! I've also done takeout and have never had a problem with that either!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tacoma,2.6,2.68,2.68,,2.648
72,Stacey R.,"Puyallup, WA",0,8,,1.0,2017-12-07,Don't waste your time here except with to go Cheesecake. Stopped in here after Christmas shopping at 7:30pm on a Thursday night. Place was 1/3 full at best. Host barely acknowledged us. After seated server was great. Took an hour for our food to come out. An hour!!! Manager cake by twice apologizing but ultimately doing nothing. Server refilled drinks and checked on us often. Manager served our food which was lukewarm to cold and my shrimp were like rubber. Barely choked it down even though we were starving at this point. Received bill with no discounts taken off. Asked for manager who took off our $8 to go cheesecakes.... really an hour and it's worth $8?!?! For cold food. Whatever won't go back. Also had to go to service bar ourselves to get our to go Cheesecake. Never again. No wonder this location has such poor ratings. To add insult to injury by the time we got out of there a full hour and 45 minutes later the mall was closed and we had to walk all the way around outside in the freezing cold and dark parking lot. Awesome. Thanks Cheesecake Factory.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tacoma?start=60,2.44,2.68,2.68,,2.584
30,Dean N.,"Tacoma, WA",26,6,,2.0,2017-12-07,I have been to many Cheesecake Factories but none as bad as this one. The staff was rude and unprofessional. There was an issue with them not seating our group so asked to speak to a manager and she was about as unprofessional as the come. The only bright spot was the server was pleasant (the reason for 2 and not 1 star). The food was only so so. Will definitely never go back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tacoma?start=20,2.48,2.65,2.65,,2.582

My mans order was the best thing I think I have ever tasted. He got the cajun jumbalaya , it was so goooood!!! Seriously had to use those exclamation marks to make you understand that you need to order that. Dec 11th  This is my 3rd time here, I love the food However I hate the 15-20 minutes min wait they always have tables open its like they like to make you wait. No matter how many people are there, there is always a wait.

Then, I opened the blasts in my hotel room. I wouldn't believe this review if it wasn't my own order. 5 out of 8 blasts had no chicken in them. You read that correctly. The buffalo chicken blasts did not have chicken in them. I don't even know how Cheesecake Factory accomplish cooking the empty triangles. That is as bad as it gets.

9,Zipporah J.,"Tacoma, WA",128,13,2.0,3.0,2017-12-18,"The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, but the meal itself was very underwhelming. If I were rating on the quality of food alone, I would only give a one star rating. Brandon was our server and he was excellent. Despite the restaurant being very busy, he was extremely attentive and was there to refill our drinks sometimes before I even noticed I was running low. We are a large party of 8 which includes 4 kids and a baby, but he was very patient and accommodating! He even got one of the items taken off from our bill because the kids didn't like it. If I were just rating him, this would be a five star review. Chances are that if I wanted some cheesecake and maybe a drink or two and was in the area, I could see myself coming back.

61,Amanda H.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,,1.0,2017-12-20,"I have been to this Cheesecake Factory three times with the hopes of it getting better. To my disappointment though, it is always a horrible experience. The first time I ordered a to-go meal. It took over an hour, they messed up the order, were rude about it, and never apologized. The second time, we sat down to eat. The server was awful, our food arrived at different times, and the kids meal took the longest. I had to beg for some fruit to keep her happy, even though 3 out of 4 of the adult meals had already arrived. Once again, no apology, or offer to compensate. Today, we went with a group of three adults and four kids. The restaurant was relatively empty when we got there. It took over an hour to get our meals, two hours to actually leave, the food came out at different times. The drinks took forever. The boxes and checks took even longer. It was horrible. The service here sucks! They need new management and training.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tacoma?start=60,2.64,2.63,2.63,,2.6340000000000003

Although the restaurant did not appear busy it too forever to get service. We waited 25 minutes after we ordered to finally get our food. I ordered the Avocado egg rolls which were good but just toward the end there was a hair in the dipping sauce. The waitress told me that it was unacceptable and that the manager would be right over.. after waiting 15 minutes, just paid the bill and left. The combination of inattentive server and what appears to be lack of concern for their customers by management, I won't be back nor recommend this venue.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tacoma?start=20,2.52,2.59,2.59,,2.5620000000000003

We were greeted and seated immediately but it took around 5-7 minutes for our waitress to show up. We placed our order of 2 small plate specials and our entree orders. A lunch pizza and salad, fettuccine Alfredo, bacon burger and steak Diane. We also ordered drinks like that 8 dollar milkshake. 10 mins go by. No bread, no drinks and finally our waitress shows up saying they were out of one of the small plates- we orders truffle bacon grilled cheese, Nashville hot chicken bites, chicken taquitos(out)  and there are no small pizzas for the lunch special but she will just order the large one. We asked for the same price and she stated no- . Ok. So now we are 10 kind behind with our food orders and small plate order. Any who... chicken was amazing. Not as hot as real Nashville hot chicken but good. And the truffle bacon grilled cheese was great.

We went to the front to wait to be seated and the girl seemed annoyed with us at the counter. It wasn't a great first impression. We would've left if it wasn't for the gift card we had. Our server Robert changed our entire experience once we were seated. He was very helpful with questions we had about the menu and he had a great customer service attitude. My wife had the veggie burger and I had the steak Diane. The food was very good and above average. The atmosphere is really cool! We will probably return sometime.
