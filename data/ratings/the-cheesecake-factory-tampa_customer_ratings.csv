260,Michelle M.,"Tampa, FL",358,1149,1892.0,3.0,2012-01-11,"The Cheesecake Factory is not my favorite restaurant, but it is a great option when no one can make up their mind of what they want to eat! My number one gripe is the wait to get a table.  A 25 minute wait at 2:30pm on a Saturday seems excessive...especially when it is not lunch rush.  Because the restaurant is always packed the service is always slow at one point in the meal.  Whether it's waiting on the check or waiting on dessert you will be searching for your waiter at one point or another. The food is really hit or miss.  The menu is huge so can you really believe that the restaurant serves good burgers, salads, pastas, sushi, chinese, steaks, and home cooked meals???  If they would simplify the menu the kitchen would run so much faster (and their would be fewer let downs on the menu).  On my last visit I ordered the BBQ ranch chicken salad and got four piece of chicken on my salad.  I was lucky if there were 2 oz of chicken on the salad.  I do love their bread, but I surprisingly am not a fan of the cheesecake.  How can you call yourself the Cheesecake Factory and offer the worst cheesecake?!?! That's right, 30 +/- different flavors of poorly flavored cheesecake.  The texture is just off.  Reminds me of one of those no-bake Jell-o cheesecake mixes. The food isn't terrible, it just isn't great.  The restaurant is covered in strollers which is great for families, but not so great for single couples. For the prices and the lackluster food I would skip Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tampa?start=260,3.24,3.24,3.24,2.8600000000000003,3.2400000000000007

Worth every single one. I find the atmosphere very clean, modern, and inviting, and the service has been great every time I've been.  I try to avoid rush hour because it gets packed, despite being a large restaurant.  I'm a fan!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tampa?start=320,3.24,3.24,3.24,3.024,3.2400000000000007

I will update my review if we decide to return to this business with a 2- or 4-person party, and the experience is different. Valet parking was prompt and secured our vehicle right in front of the restaurant (which elicited no complaints from us!). The wait was 30 minutes after we arrived, although we had called ahead an hour before to let them know to expect a largish party. After they were unable to produce a table in a reasonable time, we agreed to sit in the bar area. Bar service before the meal was excellent: fast, humorous, and attentive. Service was slow but our server had a good personality and made no mistakes on any of our orders or drinks. Recommendations were provided and appreciated for first-timers. Our meals ran the gamut from bland to excellent, and no one had any ""major"" complaints, or had to send anything back. Personally, my meal was shockingly tasteless for the amount of ingredients. One thing to watch out for: the automatically-included gratuity wasn't clear on the receipt, leaving some of us to accidentally tip 40% or more.

You gotta give it to Cheesecake Corporate...they know how to handle a restaurant. The food is very good, the service as well...and the cheesecake of course is over the top. The interior of the place is gorgeous and comfortable - if a bit loud from being constantly packed full with a line at the door. The new ""Skinnylicious"" menu is a huge score - more places should have this option. The normal menu consists of portions the size of horse troughs. All of the food is interesting and there is really something for ANY taste imaginable. Chains CAN be done well, there's obviously a reason they become so popular that they start to multiply like rabbits. In some cases, like Olive Garden - they produce bland but predictable dreck alongside unlimited breadsticks and salad - and that combo equals success.

Pardon me while I dismount my soapbox to continue my review... Anyhow, I wasn't super hungry so I ordered white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake and some coffee.  It was marginal.  That is what the Cheesecake Factory's motto should be...overpriced food of marginal quality.  Oh, and tell the gatekeeper I said hello should you care to waste an entire evening waiting in line for crappy food and service not even worth mentioning...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tampa?start=360,3.24,3.24,3.24,2.6960000000000006,3.2400000000000007

218,Misty B.,"Tampa, FL",138,135,282.0,5.0,2012-08-19,"Normally I wouldn't bother writing a review for one of the most consistent and successful chains in America. But that new Skinnylicious menu has pushed me over the edge.  Since its release, I have visited this Cheesecake Factory more times in the past month than the past five years.  What's always worked for Cheesecake: all-around crowd-friendly menu. Want standard American fare? A nod to Asian or Mexican? Steak, seafood, tapas, bar food? Just great drinks? Check, check, check and check. Perfect for large parties, kids, energetic (read: loud) groups and finicky eaters.  Portions are mammoth, and service is friendly, well-timed, knowledgeable and consistent from location to location.  But for us trying to keep our girlish figures, we'd have to use this spot for our ""cheat day"" or resign ourselves to the half salads. Blech. Now there's the Skinnylicious Menu, which delivers on flavor, variety AND portion size -- no easy feat. In fact, the only place that does it equally well is Seasons 52 (but Seasons manages a 480-calorie max compared to Cheesecake's 590). I haven't tried much yet (keep ordering the same things!), but my favorite items on the Skinnylicious Menu are the Chicken Enchiladas and the White Chicken Chili. The escabeche veggies that come with the enchiladas don't replace the regular menu's black beans and rice flavor-wise, but it's a small sacrifice for the opportunity to indulge in All. That. Cheese.

381,Thuy H.,"Tampa, FL",53,175,25.0,2.0,2012-09-16,"HORRIBLE service.  We sat in the bar area and the place was packed.  I am normally understanding when it is busy, but I am not so understanding today.  The table next to us had faster service and they turned over that table 3 times while we were there.  You figured if two women spending close to $100.00 for lunch we would receive a little more attention.  We ordered appetizers and it took forever to come out.  When the entrees finally came, the waitress attempted to give me a dirty spoon but I looked up and saw her trying to wipe the crud off the spoon.  So I sat there for 10 minutes waiting for a spoon.  NO one came back with a spoon.  So I had to use the teaspoon because I hate eating cold food,  About 10 minutes after starting on my gumbo, I see a wait staff come walking by.  The person didn't come back until 10 minutes later.  When dessert came out, they only brought out 1 spoon for 2 slices of cheesecake.  It took another 5 minutes for someone to bring one.  I miss the customer service I usually get it this chain.   The gumbo that I ordered was ok.  The shrimp was hard and chewy.  I ordered brown rice and white rice came out instead.  I didn't want to send it back because they are so damn slow here.  The food isn't as good as I remember it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tampa?start=380,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.6000000000000005,3.3200000000000003
372,Heather S.,"Keene, NH",46,66,3.0,2.0,2012-09-17,"Did anyone else notice how slippery the floor is? I'm not sure if it was just that night, or if its like that all the time. If it is always that slick then girls in their heels must fall ALOT.  That being said, watching someone fall would have been the high light of this meal. Because it sucked.  I am not complaining about the massive crowds of people, the 45 minute wait, the noise level, any of that. That's all expected and tolerable.  Service from a nice blonde woman with an accent was just fine. She obviously had quite a few tables and was busy but she seemed cool under pressure and gave us as much attention as needed. Here is the problem: with a menu of that size, there are going to be dishes in there that don't get made often enough for the cooks to really bring them to their full potential. A place of that size probably has a massive turnover rate for employees, so chances are if you order something a little off the beaten-10-page-menu-path, you may find that your meal is being prepared by someone who doesn't know how to properly make it. Large menus are never a good sign. It may seem very exciting ('ooh, look at all my options!') but trust me... quality over quantity.  The $12 strawberry martini I got was definitely $12 worth of vodka, but it was so strong it was not enjoyable. Maybe I'm particular cause I work at a martini bar, but it was a tough time choking it down. Or maybe I just chose the wrong drink. We were seated at a little two top in sort of a nook and there was a four top table next to us. It was a decent spot that gave us shelter from the noise and all the passerbys but the size of the table quickly became a problem once our food came out. We ordered the papas bravas (which were the best thing we had besides the bread), a Greek salad (which was good), the fried macaroni and cheese (the breading was a little too thick, the mac and cheese a little dry, and not enough of the creamy marinara sauce on the plate to pick up the slack) and the spinach and cheese dip. The dip we didn't eat. Something was just off. The spinach to cheese ratio was off, the spinach was quite stringy and sticky... blech. And the tortilla chips were too thick and tasted cheap.  With all that food on the table we literally had to eat over the dishes. There was no room for my appetizer plate. And then once the customers next to us left, they pulled the tables apart and now we were in a row of 3 two tops all stacked up next to each other. One couple that got sat in the middle table complained and asked for a different table. When we left they were still waiting for another table that was up to their standard. (cough*stuckup*cough) Ok so the food wasn't that great, but maybe they could make up for it with dessert. I ordered the vanilla bean cheesecake. Some bites tasted good and some bites tasted like playdough. I just recently started baking my own cheesecakes and I thought I'd be blown away by a place that is named after it... nope. Maybe I could give them some pointers. I wouldn't say my expectations for this place were set very high. But I did have a glimmer of hope that somewhere out there would be a chain restaurant that lived up to its hype.

Ordered a Chicken Bellagio and my wife got a Chicken Di Pana. We got our bread and drinks waited for about 20 minutes. Then, my wife's meal comes out and I am told it will be a few minutes for mine. Almost 10 minutes go by when mine finally arrives. The girl asks if I want Parmesean cheese and I say sure. She says that will be out in a few minutes. I find that kind of weird.  Another 7 or 8 minutes go by and I finally get Parmesean but my wife isn't offered any and the waitress is gone.  Oh, and I am still waiting for a drink refill at this point. Finally, our waiter Ryan comes back and gets us a drink, after being out for over 20 minutes.

My Husband ordered Jambalaya and was brought Chipotle Chicken. We had to wait about 10 minutes for our server to come back from the kitchen. When he arrived he basically called my Husband a liar and said that he ordered the Chipotle Chicken (which is not even something my Husband would consider from the menu), but agreed to bring the correct dish.

309,Grace C.,"Tampa, FL",313,350,218.0,4.0,2012-11-11,"This is one of my favorite chains to visit but the wait is normally extremely long. Thankfully, most of the chains are located near a mall so you can kill time while some sad person in your party waits within tracking distance of the beeper :) Ever since I've changed my lifestyle to adopt healthier habits, I've paid close attention to the calorie counts of my old favorites. Cheesecake Factory has gotten a really bad rap (with good reason) for their large, salty, fatty and caloric portions. I'm really happy to see that since my last visit to the chain, they've included a Skinnylicious(C) Menu that is separate from the main menu.  Each section marks a guesstimate of the calories. I ordered their lettuce wrapped chicken tacos in the ""less than 490 calories"" section. It was extremely flavorful and I loved it! I chose the Mediterranean Chicken Lettuce Tacos that had a side of Tzatziki sauce which was thicky and tangy. Everything was delicious and I finished the entire thing. The table was also served complimentary bread which was hard to turn down since it came warm. I did avoid the side of butter that it came with. My boyfriend ordered a Grilled Chicken and Avocado Club Sandwich that came with a side of fries. I may or may not have taken a few bites of his fries. He enjoyed his sandwich and finished it completely. My brother ordered the Smokehouse BBQ Burger that was bigger than his head. He had no problems finishing it though and he loved every bite. It seemed extremely juicy and flavorful. It was piled high with fried onion rings which my brother raved about.  After our savory dishes, our table shared the dessert. How can you not save room for dessert when you are here?  It was hard to pinpoint which cheesecake we wanted to try since all of them sounded fantastic.  We ordered the Hersey Chocolate Bar Cheesecake which was delicious and perfectly creamy. We managed to finish half of it before we asked our server to put it in a to-go box.

After the 40-50 typical minute wait, you are seated.  But... the restaurant seating is atrocious.  You are either on top of someone or in a cavernous corner somewhere off the beaten path. The floors are more slippery than the ice at the Forum and you would think that if 3 different people fall in the span of a 3 hour period that they would do something about it. As with most places there are good and bad servers.  Our waitress this weekend was great, but swamped.  The issue we had was that a server/runner dropped a plate of food in someones lap at the table and then just decided to run away..    The manager came over and apologized, but in an unfortunate sort of ""I'm here because I have to be"" type of apology.  No offer for a free dessert or to take care of the peanut and soy sauce dry cleaning bill...  Just ""oh well""  With such an amazing variety of items on the menu, you expect better.  It's hit or miss with the dishes here and it shouldn't be.   You can do better Tampa!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tampa?start=300,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.9520000000000004,3.2000000000000006

350,Chad Z.,"Tampa, FL",3,16,3.0,4.0,2012-11-22,"I love the atmosphere that The Cheesecake Factory (TCF) offers - it is semi-upscale and classy but at the same time it is casual. It has a classy aura to it right when you walk in the door with the decorations. The servers even look like they belong at a super upscale restaurant.  Once you are seated and you are able to look at the menu you can tell that you aren't at an ordinary restaurant. They offer many types of food - italian, to me, is most prominent. The cheesecake is obviously phenomenal!  This location didn't get a 5 star vote from me for 2 reasons. First, there is always a long wait to be seated. My primary issue with this is the hostess told me they didn't accept reservations, but I just read here on Yelp that they do. I've been there three times and I've asked each time and they told me they didn't. The second reason why this TCF didn't earn a 5 star rating is because of the seating arrangements. After you've waited forever to be seated you might as well be sitting with strangers. Each time I've been to TCF I could clearly hear what the table to the next of me was talking about. The seating arrangements are entirely too close to each other.  Overall, I love The Cheesecake Factory. The waits and the seating aren't enough to stop me from going there. I personally think the food and the desserts are well worth the wait!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tampa?start=340,3.2,3.2,3.2,3.2800000000000002,3.2000000000000006
424,Nikki J.,"Tampa, FL",0,40,,5.0,2012-12-09,"I know the Cheese Cake Factory is a chain but it's my guilty pleasure. I love their food, I love their cocktails and of course I love their cheese cake. Some Good Notes About The Cheese Cake Factory: Hands down best mojito I've ever had - The Pineapple Mojito. I rarely do cocktails at chain restaurants becuase they use cheap mixes that taste like crap. So one day I was out celebrating with a friend and we decided we were going to have drinks. The waitress suggested the pineapple mojito and I have yet to find a mojito anywhere that tastes as amazing as this. Not only is this a fresh handcrafted cocktail but their is no funky ""mix"" taste, they use fresh pineapple and it's not overly sugary/sweet. I have sampled many items on their menu, they are all very good, I've honestly never had anything bad but I really love their Chicken Bellagio. It's a fried chicken cutlet over a some pasta in a basil cream sauce that has a prosciutto and arugula salad on top. It's often slightly too salty for me so I always get a small bowl of marinara sauce on the side. Their brunch is delicious and never disappoints! I've had their eggs benedict, crab hash, steak and eggs and my favorite by far is the baja chicken hash. It's tortillas loaded with chicken chorizo, chilis, potatoes, cheese, peppers and onions. On top of that it's covered with eggs and a hollandaise sauce. It's so smoky and flavorful and just all kinds of yumminess. You must try this if you go there. Of course their cheesecakes are amazing too. I have yet to try a flavor I didn't like. Some Not So Good Notes: Let's face it, it's a popular chain so sometimes the wait sucks and it's at a crowded mall. Also I do find their drinks are a little over pricd. Other then that I can't say I have any complaints. Bottom Line: Typical chains offers great food for brunch, lunch, dinner or dessert and has really great cocktails.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tampa?start=420,3.28,3.28,3.28,3.3800000000000003,3.2800000000000002

The boyfriend and I got a regular and pomegranate mojito while we were waiting; they were pretty good, but not the best ever.  Our waiter was so professional; before he even came over with menus he noticed that we had cocktails and brought over ice water and lemons in a dish, I really appreciated that. Took our orders and put it right in, and then brought warm bread out, yummy!  The boyfriend got a Cajun burger with the house salad. He liked the balsamic vinaigrette but thought his burger could have been spicier, since it was touted as cajun (but his family is from Louisiana, so he always has high, spicy standards!) The highlight was definitely my entree, which was the four cheese pasta with chicken. Aside from the small fact that I think there could've been more chicken, talk about a ton of food! I even ordered the lunch portion and I ate maybe a third of it (granted, I ate my fair share of bread, but even with that, this was a ginormous portion). There was fresh cheese everywhere; it made this Italian girl happy! Topped off the meal with cheesecake; boyfriend got the Kailua cheesecake and I got the cookie dough cheesecake. Divine.

My husband is thrilled he won't have to suffer through another mediocre meal and it's bittersweet I won't have to deal with incompetent staff and a slow kitchen, because I enjoyed the anticipation of knowing I would soon be indulging in what I think is the best creamiest cheesecake...but it's not worth it.  The menu is just too big for the average waitstaff to manage and apparently, the restaurant is too large for the kitchen to keep up with. The last few times I've eaten there they delivered the wrong food approximately 20-30 minutes after being seated.  By then, I'm starving and irritated. My husband finished his dry pork chop and overly salted and oiled spinach long before my correct salad (simple salad!) arrived....exact same thing that happened last time except my husband was eating some other entree hoping he'd find something he'd like in their catalog of food.  He has literally tried dozens of things and everything is either bland, dry or salty.  My favorite was the skinny pear and endive salad, but they changed the once drinkable salad dressing to a gooey, gelatinous goop, and they can't seem to deliver it right. The corn cake app and lettuce wraps were pretty fail-proof items too, but once again, the wait time for the kitchen and wait time to correct the item isn't worth the stress b/c chances are from the time the words leave your mouth and travel to the wait staff's brain and into the computer system, something will get miscommunicated.

In particular on a prime night like tonight, my total wait time was 20 minutes.

But fear not, there are some bold flavors and dishes that chefs have taken pride in. So, don't be afraid to try something new on every visit. Specialty cocktails are also crafted with thought and freshness. I think many of their cocktails people remember quite fond in their dining experience. However, these specialty cocktails do come at a pricey rate based on liquor used and juices infused. Tonight I had fried macaroni and cheese in a bed of creamy marinara sauce and topped with fresh grated parmesan. No matter how you spin mac and cheese I always look for that comfort food feeling. This starter definitely hits that note. I also ordered a classic mojito. Upon presentation the clean, citrusy and herbaceous appearance is aesthetically pleasing on the eye. This is one of thee best mojito's out there with crisp and refreshing flavor. For an entree I ordered the miso salmon. Lets just say if you are not or have not been a salmon fan try salmon again for the first time with miso salmon as your entree. Dinner would not be complete without cheesecake so I tried lemon raspberry cream cheesecake. I was out voted at the table, but if you are a fan of tart flavors, this this is your dessert of choice.

On the first day I shared them with my boyfriend, on the second - I made a double order for myself  (of course later I realized that  it was too much and I have a little room left for a main meal). Bread was very good too - freshly baked. Try dark one too - I did not eat it on the first day fearing that it may have caraway seed, but it does not, do not judge the taste because appearance. It is yum-yum. On the first day had a rib-eye steak - it was cooked the way I wanted it, the only issue with it was too much black pepper on it. Even my boyfriend supported me in that - they need to either warn the customer or ask how much to use. The carrot cake was good too - despite that I generally do not like anything with cinnamon in it. On the second day I had grilled salmon with mashed potatoes and  steamed broccoli. Salmon was good but seasoning did not penetrate the fish throughout so if not dip/sauce aside, just on its own - it was somewhat tasteless. Broccoli were steamed to my liking: not raw but at the same time not overcooked: just right amount of crispiness. My boyfriend had their pasta with meat sauce - the plate got empty too fast - so it was too late for me to remind him about the amount he should eat if he wants to lose weight :))) Overall it was nice experience, good food and good service, clean restaurant.

Although I have to admit some of their menu items (avocado rolls, fried zucchini, veggie pasta, etc) are always a good staple food, I don't think any of the food here can be considered healthy. It's overloaded with fat, grease, oil, etc to boost the flavors of the food but not always the best of quality. This CheeseCake factory is large, usually there isn't much of a line considering the number of other gourmet restaurants in a quarter mile from this location.

I parked near the Bay Street (outdoor food court) section of the Mall, and figured that I'd grab something for dinner after I finished shopping. I thought I could find a nice entrée salad or a light pasta dish, and not blow my budget in the process. As I'm wandering along past all of the eateries and drinking establishments of Bay Street I spotted a long-lost friend at the end of the walkway -- The Cheesecake Factory. I haven't eaten at a CF in ages, but I had heard they now have a ""lighter"" SkinnyLiscious menu as well as some small plate specials, and I figured that was worth a try. Lots of things looked interesting on their menu, but I ended up with a plate of Sautéed Shrimp served over Angel Hair Pasta. My entrée was 5 large shrimp sautéed with herbs, lemon and garlic, and then plated atop Angel Hair pasta, sun-dried tomatoes and fresh basil. This was teensy bit more than the 450 calorie offerings on the SkinnyLiscious menu, but it was very tasty, and not coated in oil or a heavy sauce. The menu at the Cheesecake Factory is positively huge with a little bit of everything to appeal to a wide range of tastes. On the weekends the wait to be seated can be up to an hour, and plenty of people are determined to stand there and wait for their table. I can't get excited about waiting that long to get seated in a standard chain restaurant, but that's just my opinion. Now the main reason that people flock to the Cheesecake Factory is for their desserts, and if you hope to maintain any dignity and self-respect, you'll skip right over this section of the menu and just order a small luncheon salad and a glass of water. Unfortunately, the vast majority of their patrons flip right to the two page listing of the various types of cheesecake (I'm guessing 50 or so), and fixate on dessert as they wolf down their meals. Not to fear my friends as you can walk to the bakery counter and order your slices of cheesecake to go, and take this delicacy back to your office or to your home, and savor every morsel in complete privacy. Half the fun is watching your fellow diners drooling over all of the choices as they try to decide which one (OK, maybe two) slice(s) will be going home with them. Thankfully I maintained my composure at dinner and just had the pasta. But I sure would like to know how that to-go bag with a slice of Key Lime pie cheesecake ended up on the front seat of my SUV as I pulled out of the Mall's parking lot....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tampa?start=200,3.44,3.44,3.44,3.0520000000000005,3.4400000000000004

I hadn't been here in a while (mostly because I hate everything about International Mall), but a friend and I had a late lunch here after having to make some mall purchases.  I think this was the first time I had been where I didn't have to wait for a table (Friday at 3pm). We were seated immediately and our server came over promptly. Our server was the right amount of attentive and helpful, our drinks (yes, we were day drinking- don't judge) came quickly from the bar.  The regular menu indicated a Gluten Free menu was available so I asked for that- expecting it to pretty much just have their salads and  meat dishes listed. Was I wrong!  Their GF menu is spiral bound like a normal menu- and includes sandwiches with GF buns (what??) and most of their pasta dishes available with GF pasta (what??).  Suddenly the world felt like my oyster!  I ordered a delicious eggplant sandwich on a delicious gluten free bun (not crumbly at all).  My friend had a grilled chicken club with avocado. Also delicious.  The regular and sweet potato fries were cooked to perfection.   We skipped out on the actual cheesecake this time- but my favorite has always been the Dutch Caramel Apple Streusel.   I am so delighted about the extensive GF menu that I look forward to returning again soon!  I am willing to brave International mall for Cheesecake factory- and that is why it gets 5 stars!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tampa?start=180,3.36,3.36,3.36,3.3160000000000003,3.3600000000000003

We pulled up to the mall on a Friday night.  Holy shit, this place is PACKED.  The closest parking spot is at the end of the parking lot.  Insane.  We walk up to the hostess stand and was told it would be about 20-30 minutes.  There were mobs of people standing around waiting, even though hundreds of people can fit inside.   Once you get inside, you can see this place is gigantic.  It's insanely big.  And there's also outside seating.  Even though I had a sweatshirt on and pants, I was shivering as soon as I walked in, so we decided on outside seating.  That is really the best place to sit here, because eating aside, this place is a true cultural experience, especially if you're coming from a Northern city. People here DRESS UP to come to the Cheesecake Factory.  It's crazy.  I mean seriously dress up.  Short tight dresses, everyone in 5 inch stilettos, hair and makeup done, all fancy.  I just couldn't believe it.  In Philadelphia, people don't even dress up this much for actual fancy restaurants.  It reminds you that even though you're in the same country, there are significant regional cultural difference.  The parade of people walking by was people watching gold. The food actually was good, to my surprise.  I wasn't super hungry and got the asparagus with cheese and egg and also the beet salad.  Both were very good.  We made the mistake of ordering dessert.  I'm not a huge fan of cheesecake, so ordered the warm apple pie ala mode.  Holy crap, this thing was easily enough for 6 people to eat.  It was pound and pounds of ice cream and pie.  Kind of offputting.   Our server was very attentive and sweet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tampa?start=240,3.56,3.36,3.36,3.12,3.4400000000000004

Second of all, the four hostesses could keep these menus sorted out and ready for seating instead of ignoring people and chit-chatting.

There was a general confusion about us because this didn't seem right.  When we got to the destination, I asked ""We were supposed to follow you, yes?"" She actually rolled her eyes and snapped. ""We weren't quite ready for you yet!""  So I was about to have everyone turn around when she gave an exasperated sigh and said ""Ya'll can stay now.. "" and she moved off, shaking her weave.   Look, when you deal with the public, it helps to tell someone. ""If you wait a moment, we'll seat you."" Politeness works.

The first time our server treated us very poorly. She was oddly mean and seemed annoyed at our presence almost?? I do not know if she was having a bad day or what, but it was vastly uncomfortable for us. What was ever odder is how she was treating the tables next to us! She was so kind to them and normal? It was really odd. We didn't say anything out of the usual and thanked her for our drinks and whatnot, so I still do not understand what merited the poor attitude. At the end of the meal she circled the suggested tip amount multiple times??????? This is way too nice of a restaurant for that!! We assumed maybe this is what merited the attitude- she thought we wouldn't tip? We are young, but as I said, servers! We tip great! We still tipped 20% but goodness, be nice! Our next experience there, we had the SAME girl! This time she was nice and I think she remembered us (or at least that we tipped,) because we were treated normally. Annoyingly, we were seated in this big communal booth with two other families even though the place just opened and they were pretty empty. That was frustrating, but what made it worse were flies swarming around us. It was DISGUSTING! The family next to us were feeling icky about it too.

Simply because I hate cheesecake so I assumed my hatred would carry over to the other food items. Not the case.  The first time I came here, I ordered the Chicken Strip platter. It was sorely misnamed as something like Chicken Li'l Dippers. Misnamed because I was the served the most gargantuan stack of chicken fingers I've ever seen. Like I was starving and couldn't even get through half of them. Leftovers galore.  The chicken tenders were very good, which was a relief because I would've hated to received a plate stacked with gross chicken tenders. They had the perfect batter and they were crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Cooked perfectly.  I also ordered the mashed potatoes but again, little bits of stuff infesting my mashed potatoes. Don't like that. The potatoes were very good and had no lumps, except for the aforementioned bit invaders. $15 too. Not a bad deal whatsoever. You could easily have three meals from the amount they serve. Easy four star lunch.  Second time I came here and ordered the pizza. It again was better than what I expected from this place, but it wasn't a standout. Cheese, pepperoni and sauce were good, but the crust wasn't to my liking. Seemed frozen, not freshly tossed. I probably won't order the pizza again, unless I'm drunk and already had chicken fingers that day.  Service was great the first time, a little slow the second time, but nothing to get excited about.

The kids had never been to CF so they were thrilled. We took our time with Menu (as it is extensive) and placed our orders- everything took a long time to get- from drinks to dessert. Food was fabulous but overall experience could have been better. Waiter was nice, but never offered suggestions to what to order with such a large menu. Didn't offer any drink specials, so we didn't know if there was any (hubby got a Margarita) that was very small and even commented to me (wonder how much this is)- it was all a take your order and we didn't see him again- it's a busy place- we get it- but it took a long time to just get tea and water. We enjoyed Factory Nachos- all my recommendations as I had been there the most times of the four of us. None of our Food came out at the same time. Which is annoying. Kids didn't navigate well with menu after I gave them several suggestions- they ended up with some quesadillas and a Caesars Salad. I enjoyed the SantaFe salad- I should of gotten dressing on the side- but forgot to ask and since waiter never really talked he didn't ask if I wanted it that way- it was great as always but I'm dieting and the less dressing option would have been a better choice. Husband ordered Rene's Special and I tried all of it- it was awesome- now this I remember my husband asking the waiter what do you suggest as a sandwich choice and he told my husband the chicken salad- that was the only suggestion he made (when asked) - we ordered deserts and coffees and the desert came to us with nothing to eat with- we couldn't find waiter to get forks so we waited for coffee to arrive which took quite some time to even ask for a fork. We ordered two slices of cheesecake- Godiva and Peanut butter something my husband wanted- when the Cheesecake arrived it didn't even have the Godiva Chocolate on it- hence the name! So since I couldn't eat without a fork I just stared at it knowing it was wrong (only b/c I get it every time I have visited). When he finally came back with just two forks-(never asked if we needed four) we asked for two more forks and I mentioned that the chocolate was missing. He then left and promptly returned with two pieces of wrapped Godiva chocolates. That really disappointed me- just the thought that if it was my first visit I wouldn't of known about the chocolate.

No matter if it's a random day or special occasion I think this restaurant is perfect and their food is always so scrumptious!  I think the biggest complaint I hear is that it's overpriced and I have to disagree. I think the prices are fair especially considering the portion sizes.  Their huge menu is tremendous and although it can be overwhelming, you can pick from any kind of cuisine! They start you off with little loaves of white and wheat bread for the table, the wheat is to die for I L-O-V-E their fried Mac and Cheese Balls as a starter, they are unlike any other and trust me, I've had a lot of mac and cheese! My favorite dish, Crispy Chicken Costoletta, chicken breast lightly breaded and sautéed to a crisp golden brown, served with lemon sauce, mashed potatoes and fresh asparagus. It's so good that I found the Copy Cat recipe and whipped it up at home! It's definitely enough food to take leftovers and enjoy the next day at lunch... if you can resist waiting to finish!  I'm always stuffed to the max by the end of my meal but I rarely skip out on the chance to have some delicious cheesecake; by far my favorite is the fresh strawberry cheesecake. It is perfection every single time. As far as environment, it's pretty relaxing. The lights dim in the evening and there are candles on the table for a nice ambiance.

We had the worst service experience for our party of 6. We arrived and they told us 45 minutes, there were tons of others waiting no big deal. After over an hour and no one else waiting (even though others had show up since) we were finally seated with apologies. I swear they forgot about us and it was a continued trend of the meal.  Our server came over and took a drink an appetizer order, we told him we were starving and wanted to order quickly. Another half an hour passed and they finally brought the appetizers on crazy hot plates, we all know what that means. They had been forgotten on the hot plate for a while. We finally get to order entrees and had some changes to items and there were six entrees in total. Server doesn't write a thing down, we all noted that given the experience so far we think there is no way things are coming out correct.  Oddly enough too he only gave my friend the dressing options of ranch or blue cheese for her Asian salad and when we walked out we noticed a plethora of Cheesecake Factory branded dressings that would have actually gone well with an Asian salad. Ugh.  Another 45 minutes and again raging hot plates and we get our meals minus the sauce, forgot this forgot that. It took another 15 minutes to get it all straightened out. We start looking for our server to request the check and he is nowhere in sight. We tried to flag down another server who blatantly ignored us until a manager saw us waving and he motioned for him to see what we need and out loud he goes ""that's not my table"" so the manager walks over and asks and we explain we can't seem to ever find our waiter and we need our check.  Server comes over huffing and puffing talking about some emergency in the bakery. Really what emergency could happen with a million pre-made cakes?  We paid and tried to get out as quick as possible, which even felt like it took a century. This ended up being a three hour plus dinner with crappy ass service that the manager never even attempted to figure out or apologize, he even avoided me on my way out.

The manager brought out her second pizza, which was not cooked all the way.  We sent it back one more time, and the manager as well as the server apologized again.  So they took off the pizza from our tab, as they were very understanding. I ordered the sweet corn tamale cakes like I normally do. There was double the onion this time, which was odd.

The food, while yummy and filling, is never consistently presented well. And unless you get a pasta dish, everything just looks thrown on.  The big factor for me was the lack of quality service. I felt like my group was labeled as those college kids no one wants to take care of... Which I can emphasize with because they can be loud and rowdy, but with server experience under my belt, I know it's all about how you approach people that gets you good customers. The service I experienced was ""Great, a bunch of young people who probably aren't going to tip me, so why even try?"" Plates and cups were literally just dropped onto the table and the server would walk away as fast as possible. 4pm on a Monday night so I don't buy the ""restaurant being busy"" excuse because I could just tell by watching the servers, it wasn't busy at all. She would talk polite when speaking (only if spoken to) but her blunt actions clearly spoke louder to me.  Also~ my dynamite shrimp appetizer took 25 min to get to me. For those who don't know, it's just small battered shrimp with sauce on the side...  Honestly Cheesecake Factory is just a good place to pay a lot of money to be stuffed.

But recently (with recently being the last two years or so) J-Fur and I have actually wound up at the Cheesecake Factory a number of times for meals (out-of-towners and their fear of trying something new, sheesh). I have to say, despite the fact that it is a gigantic chain, the Cheesecake Factory does a lot of things right. They have an extremely large and extensive menu. This may be overwhelming to someone who is free to eat what they want but for those of us with diet restrictions (vegan, vegetarian, gluten free) this means that we don't have to settle for just a veggie burger (although they do have a tasty version of a veggie burger that includes brown rice, farro, couscous, mushrooms, black beans, and onion). The Cheesecake Factory offers salads, appetizers, main courses, pastas and sandwiches that can cater to the vegan and gluten free crowds. On our last visit J-Fur and I decided we weren't hungry enough to order main courses so we stuck to the appetizers, salads and sides. I went with a side of fries and the avocado eggrolls. Both of these items were pretty expensive. The avocado eggrolls were in the price neighborhood as a lot of the vegetarian main courses that are offered by the restaurant. This seemed like a definite ripoff, until they brought them out. That's when I saw why they cost so much. The portions at the Cheesecake Factory are ridiculously big. I could've (and should've) skipped the ""side"" of fires (which was actually a big basket) and gotten by with just the eggrolls.  The avocado eggrolls are made from avocado, sun-dried tomato, red onion and cilantro fried in a crisp wrapper. They are served with a Tamarind-Cashew dipping sauce. I thought the eggrolls were phenomenal. They were super crispy, creamy (thanks to the avocado), bitey (red onion) and the cilantro was undetectable by my tastebuds (thank God!). The only downfall of the dish was that the dipping sauce was way too sweet. Too much tamarind for my liking. Maybe I have just been programmed to want salty with my Asian fusion food, but I kept thinking the entire time about how good it would taste with some soy sauce to dip into. I wound up leaving most of the dipping sauce and just eating the eggrolls plan (I never got around to inquiring about a side of soy sauce).  My wife ordered the Kale and Quinoa salad. It is chock full of kale and quinoa, grapes, sweet red pepper, sunflower seeds and parmesan cheese (which she lovingly got on the side). The salad was tossed with a lemon vinaigrette dressing. Again, expensive. Again, huge. Again, had a really good flavor to it. Loved that a chain jumped on the whole quinoa and kale bandwagon. For the little one, it was pizza (from the pretty extensive kid's menu). She had no qualms about that as she nearly ate the whole thing. If she hadn't loaded up on the free bread at the beginning, I bet she would've finished the entire pizza. There were no desserts for us. J-Fur was too stuffed and I'm holding out for a vegan cheesecake. As soon as they get that, I'm there. I won't go out of my way to visit the Cheesecake Factory, there are too many other amazing places in Tampa. But if an out-of-towner visits and suggests eating there, I won't grumble as loud as I might've in the past, now that I know they have more to offer than just a veggie burger and fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tampa?start=100,3.68,3.44,3.44,3.34,3.5360000000000005

After waiting for another 50 mins we finally received our ice cold food which our guests refused to eat since by this point they were completely fed up. Finally we asked to see a manager and to her credit she did try to offer other meals but at that point I think my guests we're just tired of being in the building for more than an hour without food. While I appreciate that the manager offered us new meals after an hour, as a person in the business I know that your management should be involved with talking to the table after 25 minutes is waiting for good, let alone double that time, at 50 minutes without a manager coming by to assure us that the food would be out in a prompt manner we were finally fed up.

I decided to take a table that was dirty outside Bc it was the only one in shade. All there was, was some crumbs in the table and the rude host boy decided to drop down the menus and walk away from me without even say anything and just left us there. And also rolled his eyes as he walked away. FYI rude host boy it's part of your job. If you can't perfect being a host and being polite I would maybe suggest a job change.

I drove my GF INSANE because I had no clue what I was feeling, or what to get. I will avoid this joint if I can because of the menu.  The quality of the food is on point. Great. Will make another mention as the servers never seem to know or be on the right page in terms of recommendations or suggestions. My man had no idea what he biggest portion entree was or what to get. No big deal but being a waiter is a package- you must know the best on the menu no matter how big it is. My last two visits have been the best. Enchiladas and the Southwest Grilled chicken sandwich were fabulous. I technically give this place a 3.5 but again with the teacher rule I give them the bump to 4 stars.

They also have a 10+ page food menu with food of every different type from Italian, Japanese, Thai, Chinese, American, Mexican, and other regions. I was dissapointed that the Cheese Cake factory got rid of the Thai Chicken but I recently  enjoyed Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp with Curry,  Peanut, Chile, Coconut, Sautéed Vegetables, and steamed white rice.   For Dessert, my favorite cheesecake is their Caramel Turtle Cheesecake. Other honorable mentions for best cheesecakes include: Adams Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple, Hershey's Chocolate Bar Cheesecake, Chris' Outrageous Chocolate Cheesecake, Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cheesecake, Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake, and Strawberry Cheesecake. The Cheescake Factory also serves 9 different kinds of specialty cakes and 4 different ice cream desserts. Sometimes my office orders a couple pies for everyone. I really like how the pies are precut with plastic in between so that slices can be easily taken out. I Look forward to my next visit! There is plenty of parking available in the mall's private parking lot. Our server was friendly, quick, and courteous, and we got our food in a timely manner.

We were promptly greeted by our waiter who was very attentive, filling our waters regularly and checking in on our table.  I ordered a ""skinny"" Long Island iced tea which had no sugary additives and used Sprite Zero instead of Coke. Delightful! For food, I asked for the turkey and Avocado sandwich but the waiter informed me they were out of turkey. He offered to substitute chicken and I took him up on the offer. It was very tasty, although a little dry. Needed something more than just mayo. There was bacon luckily so that helped with flavor :) It was served with a side salad that was a bit over drenched in some kind of balsamic dressing. Still tasty though.

142,Taylor A.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",28,97,33.0,3.0,2016-03-15,"A-OK is exactly how I'd describe The Cheesecake Factory. Pretty dang good, but nothing you can't find elsewhere. There's just nowhere else you'd find ALL those options in one. I've had mixed service experiences here, which is what's keeping this at a 3 star review, but it's still a place I love to visit every once in a while. That may just be because I have an addiction to cheesecake, though. If you've been to a Cheesecake Factory, then I don't need to explain the decor. It looks like every other cheesecake factory out there (Eye of Sauron included). Unfortunately the design of this particular location has left them with almost nowhere for people to wait for their table, resulting in having to stand while you wait almost every time, and also resulting in there always being a large, loud, difficult to navigate crowd directly between the door and the hostess stand. Like I said, service here has been mixed. Most of the time it's been as good as you should expect at any big chain restaurant, with attentive but busy waiters and relatively fast food delivery. This particular location seems to be really skimpy on the bread, which is unfortunate because Cheesecake Factory is one of the few places that has table bread good enough that I let myself have some. And once or twice I've gotten particularly slow service, or had waiters that seemed to forget for about 20 minutes that our table was even there. It's bound to happen occasionally but it's always unfortunate when it does. The food at the Cheesecake Factory is probably one of the better options when it comes to Big Chain restaurants. The variety definitely helps, as there's almost definitely SOMETHING on the menu that you want. And the fact that they have a Light Fare menu is always great for someone watching their waistline like me. It's also nice to find that the Light fare options still give you a hearty meal, unlike at a lot of places where salads or half portions are your only chance to stay under 1000 calories.  Price is, unsurprisingly, the same as every other Cheesecake factory. Due to having higher quality food than most chains, it's more expensive than some, but only by a dollar or two. you can definitely have a reasonably priced dinner here with no problem at all. Just make sure you get some cheesecake. It should be a crime to go to a place called the Cheesecake Factory and not have at least a bite of cheesecake. Just... come on.

The wait time for our food was extremely long with the service staff apologizing to all of the tables in our section claiming they did not anticipate being so busy so the kitchen was understaffed. When our food did finally arrive, my daughter's meat was raw...not rare, but raw. Our server was no where to be found so we finally flagged down another to ask for the meat to be cooked. 10 minutes later our missing waiter came to ask how dinner was apparently unaware of the return. He walked away, then 5 minutes later asked us ""who did you send your food back with?"" He then came back again to say they burned the meat when recooking it...so another 5 minutes passed. The Manager came over to apologize but never offered to remove the meal from the bill nor did he offer to buy a desert, a drink, nothing! When I got the bill (which we had to request from the hostess station because our server disappeared AGAIN!) we were charged full price for everything!  I have worked in the restaurant business before and to charge for a meal that took almost 30 minutes to produce and was actually edible was the worst customer service experience EVER!  We will not go back, nor will I refer any of my business clients and I will dissuade anyone from dining at this restaurant in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tampa?start=220,2.84,3.36,3.336,2.5640000000000005,3.152

Did they see me - yes. I made sure by saying hello to them, but still no response or a cool nod. The more I stood there, the more annoyed I became. Another couple showed up wanting to get a take out order. I was happy because I figured between us for sure someone would serve us. Finally someone else showed up and took our order and advised that the only person who could cash us out was on the phone. Can you imagine? The cashier had been on the phone this whole time. Well she cashed me out. My order was 8 dollars and change. I gave her $10 and the exact change hoping that I would get back 2 singles. She gave me one single and 4 quarters, no wait she substituted a quarter with a nickel. Like really how stupid do I look. I called her out on it. What a dumb cashier. She gave me 4 quarters so I had change to tip her, no wait, in anticipation that I might not tip her, she tipped herself 20 cents.

110,Daniela P.,"New York, NY",121,195,100.0,4.0,2016-05-14,"We were staying at the Renaissance hotel nearby with some family, and while I am not the biggest fan of The Cheesecake Factory, everyone decided this was the spot they wanted!  Here's why I don't like TCF: 1) It is always ridiculously packed. I have never been to a location where I didn't have to wait at least 10-15 minutes. 2) They're pretty expensive, and while they give good-sized portions, it isn't always the best quality.  As I expected, the wait was going to be at least 45 minutes. We put our name down and waited amongst crowds of teens and other families gathering together. Eventually our buzzer went off (we were a party of 7), but we were then asked to wait in another area for a couple of more minutes. We shrugged it off and laughed and were eventually seated at a booth (with an additional chair at the end).  While we perused our menus, our waitress came by to get our drinks. While she was very friendly and attentive at first, she would go on and disappear for long periods of times throughout our meal. To start we ordered a plate of beet and goat cheese salad and some spring rolls. While we waited for that to come out, we munched on warm bread. Their wheat bread is my favorite (and FYI they're totally willing to give you some to go if you ask - don't judge me!).  The starters were good. I only had the salad, but I heard the spring rolls were yummy too.  Eventually we placed our orders. We shared plates (seeing as their portions are always big and we were already munching on appetizers). I shared the herb-crusted salmon which came with mashed potatoes and asparagus. Another pair shared the 'Skinnylicious' lemon-garlic shrimp. My younger cousins split the calamari plate and the sliders. The last plate was the chicken lettuce wrap tacos.  It didn't take as long as I thought it would for our food to come out, so that was a pleasant surprise. Before it did, our waitress brought us extra plates and napkins (which was very appreciated).  My herb-crusted salmon was delicious! It was a thick piece, so while it was thoroughly cooked it still was juicy and flavorful. The mashed potatoes were also delicious and the asparagus was cooked well. While I can't really comment on the other meals specifically, everyone seemed to thoroughly enjoy the food. One point: the sliders did look a little bit sad and were mostly bun from what I could tell.  After finishing up our meals, we asked for our check and got two pieces of cheesecake to go - Oreo and Reese's. They were both delicious (I didn't have them now but I've had the Oreo before).  While our server wasn't extremely attentive, she was very friendly and did help us out and the restaurant was extremely busy, so I understand. Other than that, we had great service.  While we were parked at the hotel, parking is easy to find since there's a lot for the mall. The bathrooms were clean.  Overall it was a good meal!

We ended up getting the buffalo blasts as an appetizer which while very good is still heavily fried. The ranch dressing is some of the best I have ever had.

I walked in and was not greeted. no one was at the desk. a woman came in behind me and asked where the hostess was. I looked around at the attempt to make the architecture resemble something Romanesque. I just found it phony, overly ambitious and distasteful. parts of the ceiling near the entrance appear to be 30 feet high.  I was finally taken to an area where there were a bunch of people and it was loud. i'm hearing impaired and with the cavernous ceilings it was echoing and reverberating in my hearing helpers like Jimmy Hendrix at Woodstock.  I asked for a quiet area and was given one. I ordered Steak Diane medium with mashed potatoes for $20 and just to use up the rest of the gift card I asked for a side of French fries for $5. the steak was served very warm and tasty, perfectly prepared medium with grilled onions. but the mashed potatoes were not only unremarkable and NOT warm but they were so rigid that I put my heavy butter knife into them handle side up and it stood up straight then finally fell over after 30 seconds. I hit the mound of ""mud"" with my spoon and I hardly put a dent in it. the fries looked nice but had obviously been made first and were sitting (along with the mashed potatoes) under a heat lamp until the sirloin was done cooking. they had little warmth to them.

I waited for probably 10-15 minutes before someone even acknowledged me. Not to mention, I was the next in line with several behind me.

I've been going here for years and I always loved this restaurant however I've never tried to go until recently. Today I ordered curbside to go. When the girl answered she said hold on for just a second I'll put you on a brief hold then you can order. Their brief hold is apparently 7 minutes long. When I was about to hang up and re-dial (thinking they had forgotten about me) they finally answered. I quickly placed my order as I knew exactly what I wanted. I also asked to do curbside and they said ok but I realized when I hung up the phone that they never asked me about my vehicle so I'm not sure how they would know who to bring the food out to. They told me it would take about ""20-25 minutes"". I showed up at roughly the 20 minute mark after I hung up the phone and I went inside to let them know I was there since they didn't know what vehicle I'd be waiting in. I paid for my order and the woman said the food wasn't ready yet but she'd have them bring it out to me. Now I understand that it was a busy Friday night but everyone knows the cardinal rule of customer service is to under-promise then over-deliver. (Not vice-versa).  So I waited for about 30 additional minutes in my car (mind you, it's now been 50 minutes since I placed my order and hung up the phone, roughly an hour since I initially picked up the phone if you include the long hold). I finally decided to go back inside. My order was sitting at the counter and they apologized that no one had brought it out to my car yet, she said it just got there.  So roughly an hour after I placed my order I got my to go food. I left unhappy but didn't feel like dealing with the hassle as it was very loud and crowded in there. In the end the food took about 3 times as long as the promised amount of time it was supposed to be ready, which is extremely ridiculous if you ask me. Additionally I rushed home and got home very quickly to eat and my food was cold. So I can't imagine it just had come out of the kitchen when I finally received it. Not to mention, in the half an hour I was sitting in my car, they could have been polite and told me what the hold up was but they did not. Overall, I was highly disappointed with the whole episode. Again, I understand that it was a busy weekend night but staff should be planned accordingly and a restaurant that's been around for this long should be able to give a better pick up estimate and when they do not properly estimate they should be providing updates and/or at the very least, comp my meal. Highly dissatisfied with my experience here.

It was like the child care area of this place. Our time there we counted 12 children.   There was only 2-3 tables that did not have a kid at it making our dinning very unpleasant.  We ordered drinks and appetizer.  It came at  good timing.  Orders were placed at that time.  We did not think that we ordered anything that would take 40 min. to prepare but it did.  All the time sitting here and enduring the crying, unruly children of others.  As big as this place is you would think that there could be one area that children & parents could be seated so they could equally enjoy all the crying kids together and not ruin everyone's dinning.  This  eating facility may want to consider separate seating areas for the above reasons.  We considered this a waste of time and good money on food and service which was average at best.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tampa?start=140,2.52,2.88,3.188,2.6280000000000006,2.736

Salad as my appetizer and for dinner the Cuban egg rolls. They are so delicious. My friend had one of my other favorites which is the Miso salmon. It is so good.  I know that salmon is good for you and I try to eat it whenever possible. But a lot of times it doesn't really taste all that great. But the Cheesecake Factory miso salmon is the bomb. My sister had the chicken pot pie on the skinnylicious menu which is also really good choice. Of course you get to start off with their delicious brown bread which is so good period I can eat a basket of just that. On top of the delicious food items they also have a great dessert menu. Their cheesecakes are so delicious. My favorite is the red velvet cheesecake. Although the dulce de leche is pretty awesome too. And they have a great drinks. My sister and friend both had the Georgia Peach which is a very very tasty beverage. Although they have really good Mojitos there too I love them all. In addition to the great food and drinks this place is really nicely decorated and has a great atmosphere. You feel like you're doing fine dining. Prices are pretty reasonable as well.

My son had their fish tacos, fried cod. Crispy fish surrounded with cabbage and tomatoes. He enjoyed all four! My daughter had a standard chicken avacado bacon sandwich. Served on texas style toast which provided more of a buttery taste than a boring bun. I selected mexican lettuce wraps.  The chicken was a little over cooked and under seasoned, but the salsa added a tiny bit of flavor.  But the star of the meal were the cheesecakes. My son had a compilation of carmel, peanut butter and chocolate.  It was very peanut buttery, but still silky smooth. My daughter's choice was much richer in taste; she had the S'mores. It had sprinkles of graham crackers, melted marshmallows and a huge dollop of whip cream.  So good!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tampa?start=20,3.08,2.95,3.184,2.8000000000000003,3.0020000000000007

17,Todd W.,"Tampa, FL",1405,703,282.0,1.0,2017-06-17,"How exactly does this place stay in business anyway? It had been about five years since I visited any Cheesecake Factory, even though I live across the street from this particular location and walk by it regularly on my way to The Pub or Bar Louie. For some reason, we decided to go there for a late evening dinner on a Saturday night just for convenience. There's just absolutely no value to be had here and the quality of the product is not worth the price. We did not even have an entree, instead splitting a salad with two small plates and one round of drinks that included a draft beer and a weak Moscow Mule that was not even served in the appropriate copper mug. Service was provided by a woman who wore more makeup than the employees at the MAC store inside the mall itself. At least those ladies are selling it. This woman also bragged about how she spends her leisure time acting like a Disney princess. If you don't know, there's people who frequently do this when attending the parks that are not Disney employees. They act like they're part of the attraction, but they're not. They are screaming for attention...just like the guy who comes to a sports bar alone wearing his favorite team's colors and makes a huge production out of anything that happens in his team's game hoping to find a new friend who actually gives a shit. $55 later, I came home hungry, thirsty, poured myself a second drink, made a sandwich and regretted the complete waste of money and time invested in the evening. Thank goodness we did not both order entrees, a second round of drinks and dessert. Clearly a normal dinner here is going to run you around or upwards of $100 and I'd much rather spend that at a place that doesn't feel like it is a half step above a fast-casual lunch spot. I've always said Bern's and Mons live off their overrated reputations better than any businesses in Tampa, but Cheesecake Factory should be the chain representative on that short list.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tampa,3.12,2.92,3.156,2.468,3.0000000000000004

Long: Honestly, I came here with extremely low expectations.  Normally places like these are overrated and not worth the price.  To my surprise, Cheesecake Factory exceeded my expectations.  Now I've been here a few times already, but the last time was great.  Maybe I ordered the wrong dish the last few times. The last visit I had, we started with the tuna carpaccio.  This was so delicious, it was sliced thin and topped with this delicious togarashi aioli, looks like a mayonnaise based sjauce.  For my meal I got the Steak Diane and chicken Madeira.  Came with a side of mashed potatoes. Both the steak and chicken was season perfectly.  It was definitely delicious, the mash potatoes were a little salty.   I would suggest everyone to try out this meal. The menu is huge.  It is too big.  I believe a restaurant should have a smaller menu, without such a large variety of cuisine.  That way they can focus and improve on that, rather than has so many different dishes/ingredients to keep up with. It feels you are looking through a novel just to find the type of dish you want.  An improvement for Cheesecake factory would be to shorten their menu.  I've notice many customers take a long time to order because it is so hard to decide what to get.  This goes along with my previous experiences. From previous visits.  The food was okay and not worth the price.  One visit, I had the curry dish.  Honestly it felt mediocre and could've gotten the same dish that tastes better and lower price at a different restaurant that specializes in curry.  This is what I mean by the menu is too big.  Sometimes trying to cook too many dishes effects the quality of the meals.

Our family has been to Cheesecake factory restaurants all over the US. This particular Cheesecake however fell short on just about everything, indeed it was the dirtiest, worst Cheesecake Factory we have been to. To begin with we were served wine in a dirty wineglass, with some other customer's lip marks on it. I had to wait ten minutes for a new glas, that was moderately cleaner, still not that clean. Second, we were served old, stale, congealed macaroni and cheese (you know, with that top layer that food that is forgotten out gets after a long time standing around). Rather than apologize, the waiter started arguing with me about it. Seriously. Then we had an overdressed, as in drenched, inedible sallad. At this point we talked to a manager, who did apologize, but after that crickets. We were left alone, Completely. Our waiter disappeared, no on cleared our table, no one came to see us.  We waved and waved yet we were ignored. Finally we had to get up and go find the manager again to get the dessert order in. At this point the original waiter is back, none the better, he is grumpy and unhelpful and he completely ruined our sons birthday. Nothing at this place is what is should be. While I am at it: the fried zucchinis were overcooked, almost burned, dark brown, served with yet another congealed item, the normally super delicious  sauce. Our wantons were cold. The wings, normally the best thing ever, were dry and not spicy what so ever. We didn't bother telling anyone about anything else that was sub par at this point as we didn't feel any one cared.

She also gave us honest recommendations on what to order when we were in between items.

We placed an order of drinks and an appetizer to start off and everything came out in a timely manner.

My girlfriend looked at the wine list and ordered a $9 glass of wine, which just so happened to be the cheapest on the menu. Both of our entrées were under $20 and were huge. We each got two meals out of them and it was well worth it.  Cheesecake Factory isn't a place that I would come to and simply drink.

This steak is cook with the ginger sauce which is a good match.  Service is good over the dining time. Food come out the right time compare to my last visit. I would said the hostess need to paid attention to the empty table. Customers is less patient when exceed to the wait acknowledge time. The AC vent need to be clean and make not dripping water.

They have a massive menu selection - the menu is literally a book. And of course, several of those pages include an array of cheesecakes of all flavors!  I went for brunch with a friend and we both indulged in the Bruleed French Toast - its 2 good sized pieces of french bread that appear to dipped in a creamy eggy custard then baked and grilled so as to form the crunchy crust on the outside. So good! Comes Maple-Butter syrup and a side of bacon or ham!  They have several other brunch items like Eggs Benedict, Lemon Ricotta Pancakes, and Belgian Waffles. If you are not up for breakfast though, they still offer all of their regular menu items!  Service was great for us! Our server did a great job making sure we had everything we needed!

The bartender was super personable, and made an excellent mojito - actually one of the best I've had, and I drink them a lot when I go out. Plus our server was so efficient and organized - I feel like it was some of the best service I've had in town, which is so funny that it happened at a chain restaurant. The food was okay. I know they are known for their huge portions, and entrees and salads are definitely meant to be split. I had the Thai chicken lettuce roll ups off the appetizer menu, and the best part of that dish were the three dipping sauces. Sadly, the chicken didn't seem to have much flavor. If I were preparing this dish, I think I would offer more flavorful chicken, and less bean sprouts.  Presentation was beautiful though!   We did not have time or room for cheesecake, but I'll definitely be back for another mojito - and I think I'll skip dinner and head straight for dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tampa,2.88,2.93,3.144,,2.91

I had family visiting from out of town and they don't have a Cheesecake Factory where they live so I thought what a great idea to take them there! Wrong! We decided to sit outside and it was around 1PM on a weekday so there were very few people there (aka not busy at all). We waited over 15 minutes and no waiter in sight. I had to go back inside to the hostess 3 separate times to ask for a waiter. How embarrassing is that for the out of town guests. Finally over 25 minutes later we finally get a waiter and it took a while just to get waters.  Needless to say it took a while to get the food and forever to get the bill. It took us over 2hrs to eat lunch and we were not counting on that.  Because of that we encountered major traffic after leaving and it delayed our plans for the rest of the day. On top of that the food wasn't even anything special. We never saw a manager and no one apologized for the ridiculous waiting we had to do. Very poor customer service.

My husband and I went here for dinner on a Monday night - it wasn't crowded at all, empty tables all around, and yet it took us over two hours start to finish. Our dinner (the first round) took 45 minutes to come out. My husband ordered the bang bang chicken and shrimp and the chicken was dry, there was no spice - all coconut, and the rice was undercooked and hard. The server even mentioned when they messed up the order that they make it too sweet with coconut. I ordered a spicy pasta dish and the ""sauce"" was more like watery soup. So when our server was nowhere to be found, we had another server approach us because we were looking for our original server. She took our orders back and put in the order for replacement meals and assured us she let her manager know that it was unsatisfactory. The manager never came over to speak with us and our original server only showed up to say here are your new meals maybe 30 minutes later. It was just so disappointing overall - it was like we were a bother, not paying customers. And for that matter for the price you pay at Cheesecake Factory for this level of service and quality its just insulting.

They are delicious and all vegetables with grilled chicken and some dipping sauces, great if you're avoiding bread or not wanting to feel stuff as before the dinner itself! We like to get a bottle of the cheesecake factory house red which impressively has a great taste and is worth orsering.  Also, I enjoy ordering the Stuffed chicken tortillas every time, which come with black beans and corn tamale cakes which are oh em yummy! My sister ordered the fish tacos which she enjoyed too. We all agree that the portion sizes are huge and bound to take leftovers home with you. Then of course the cheesecake for dessert is a must! I'm a classic girl so I love either the classic flavor or the fresh strawberries cheesecake, and one slice is totally shareable.

Valet was full as well. Pretty ridiculous when valet lots had spots but they weren't allowing you to park in them and wouldn't take our money for you to park in them for us.  The best part was, right when the the drink I ordered came, my husband called me from the parking lot, so frustrated he said, come back out,  we were leaving because he cannot park the car and it was getting ugly out there. I explained what was happening to the bartender and told him I had to leave - all he did was hand me the bill. I was still expected to pay for the martini, and had I known it was $13 - it wasn't on the menu- I never would have ordered it!!!  Even if he had just said, ""I am so sorry, I can't comp this drink for you, I can't believe the parking today, but I hope you can make it back here again,"" it would have made this sting less.  I understand they are a business and can't be giving free drinks out (esp priced a $13 a pop) and I get that. But I was so disappointed this happened and the guy had 0 sympathy! Instead he told me to take it outside if I wanted while I waited.  I said this is really great, paying for a drink I don't even get to have.

15,Jessica R.,"Bronx, NY",0,1,,4.0,2017-12-30,"Went in for Brunch with sister and best friend along with her kids, we were seated at one of the bigger booths which is great because we needed space to put a car seat, we were started with waters and our delicious drinks. My sister grabbed the passion fruit mojito which our waiter Chase raved about! Speaking of Chase, this man made our experience so amazing, truly not only from being super attentive to the table and keeping the water flowing but making sure the baby was happy and comfortable, he was extremely knowledgeable of the menu, and after he heard what we liked to eat he was spot on with the recommendations. People like this make dinning experiences and make people like us want to come back! The chicken Bellagio was really tasty, as always the salmon was nice and juicy and my steak was cook just as I ordered. Would definitely come back and ask to be seated in Chase's section!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tampa,2.88,2.9,3.108,,2.892

He made the whole experience perfect from beginning to end. Make sure you ask for him if you can when you swing by. He should be running the joint! And coincidentally his name is the reverse of ours :)  Thanks so much Chase!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tampa,2.88,2.94,3.112,,2.916
