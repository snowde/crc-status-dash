Since I find the portions at Cheesecake a little much, I tend to lean more on the small plates and snacks menu. I usually go for my Ahi Tartar that comes neatly stacked on cut up avocado with soy ginger sauce with sesame seeds sprinkled all over. It's a great item to have on it's own and if I'm hungry I order 2 items from the small plates menu, usually the shrimp summer rolls (both on the Skinnylicious menu!) or a flat bread pizza. You really can't go wrong with the small plates and snacks menu. You might as well mix it up since it has a bunch of great options, instead of paying $15 to $20 bucks for a ridiculously big meal that you end of taking home and just maybe throwing it out.  I believe the pricing at the Thousand Oaks location for the items mentioned above run  about $6 and there are many other yummy options to choose from: Stuffed Mushrooms, Beets with Goat Cheese Salad, Freshly baked flat bread pizzas (a total steal, its actually pretty big for an individual pizza!) So next time you Cheesecake it, load up on the inexpensive small plates and snacks menu (the SkinnyLicious menu is fantastic too!) and do it Tapas style!

We also ordered the grilled pear and blue cheese flatbread, which was excellent and highly recommend if you're more into vegetarian options.

297,Bryce W.,"Simi Valley, CA",80,220,2.0,4.0,2013-01-29,"Let's do the compliment sandwich. The good: Cheesecake factory is nice because the food is always decent to good.  The bad: Unfortunately, there are a few downsides to this one. The wait on a Friday night is 40ish minutes. That's a long time if you're already hungry. Addtionally, you have to wait with people from Thousand Oaks. If you're not from Thousand Oaks, you understand what I mean. If you are, well... you're very nice, I'm sure, but your outfit is bad no matter how ""trendy"" it is.  The also good: The service at this particular Cheesecake Factory is fantastic. Our waiter was absolutely great. He seemed genuinely pleased to serve us. He was chatty, but not too much. He was attentive without being pushy/desperate. His service would be in the 90th percentile of what I've experienced in my life. We were very pleased. To recap: Good food. Annoying people you have to wait too long with. Great service. What this all means: I'll wait the extra 20 minutes to not leave really pissed off because I didn't have water for the last 30 minutes of my meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-thousand-oaks?start=340,3.76,3.7,3.7,3.3440000000000003,3.724

Arrived at 5:45 no waiting due to the game. Yea team! Ordered beverages for 2 until the other couple arrived.  Then waited 20 minutes before our server appeared again, no apology, just as if everything was normal. We had to ask another server just to get water. Food arrived - except 3 out of 4 meals were wrong. Back they go. Still no sign of our server. In the interim I get a beverage refill offer from another server. Beverage comes back wrong. No server to be seen so I eventually (10 minutes and at this point I was timing everything) went to the bar to get it corrected. Food arrives but out of the 3 remaining meals only 2 were correct. Guess who got shorted. At this point I ask for the manager expecting the situation to be resolved.  I can understand an off night but it never got better. I ended up not eating and asked for my meal to go (I didn't check to see if it was as ordered, I may never check). Still no server so I ask for manager Angela to reappear. It took a bit longer this time to get an appearance. I got a soft sorry not a confident sorry or a we'll make it right sorry. Meals were free but the damage was done.  Finally our server appears and asks if we would like dessert. Wow, Really? I left a penny as a tip. I'm very forgiving and if our server had, as many in the past have done and probably will in the future, just said I'm sorry and then stepped up to the job at hand I would have been fine. Not sure if I can go back it was that bad but I probably will because it's the Cheesecake Factory.

BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU MAY LOOSE A LOT OF BUSINESS!!!!        I have been to many different locations to eat at cheese cake factory, but I would have to say this one was THE WORST!!        Its inside the thousand oaks mall, and we were sat on the patio which is part of the mall, when asked to sit inside and we told them we didn't mind waiting they said no. Our waiter was VERY arrogant, and acted as if we shouldn't have had the right to eat there (I'm assuming because we didn't know we were going to be judged on appearance, we were dressed too casually for this servers taste) so he ignored us most of the time, didn't offer us more water when our glasses were empty or more  bread when the basket was empty. Probably because he was too busy waiting on the two women DIRECTLY NEXT TO US because they were dressed up, had a lot of shopping bags from the higher classed stores (not to be named) and so I guess he figured they deserved his 100% undivided attention. We were treated like dirt our whole visit, like we were trash off of the street.       When we COULD ACTUALLY get his attention, he was very snobbish with us, and RUDE BEYOND BELIEF!!!!          Not to mention, the food was not as high quality as I am used to having when visiting a Cheese Cake Factory restaurant. He didn't even offer us any desert, we had to ask for the desert menu AFTER he decided it was time to shoo us off my giving us the bill!!!!  The cheesecake that I ordered tasted as if it was DAYS OLD!! and I got sick that night. our bill came out to over 90$, and my husband being as generous and sweet as he is, still left a good tip. (bless his heart)      We WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THIS LOCATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I ADVISE YOU TO TURN AND RUN FROM THIS LOCATION UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE JUDGED BY YOUR APPEARANCE, AND WANT SHITTY SERVICE.!! *** I would recommend the location in TOPANGA or the location in SHERMAN OAKS.

113,Sherri M.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",1,12,,5.0,2013-03-03,"My husband decided to pick up Cheesecake factory for dinner last night and bring it home for the family... I called in the order and it was very easy and fast. The person I spoke to was very friendly and low and behold... unlike most restaurants that are as busy as The Cheesecake Factory is on a Saturday night, everything was correct, done when they said it would be and tasted great by the time he got home with it. We had Chicken tenders and fries, Chicken Marsala and an Old Fashioned Burger and fries. The food was still nice and warm when he arrived home. This morning my husband discovered that his wallet was missing... After retracing his steps, he realized that he had probably left it at The Cheesecake Factory counter when he picked up the food last night.  Normally, my husband and I do not carry a lot of cash - but he happened to have several hundred dollars and all of his credit cards in the wallet because he had just returned from traveling. Although it was 8:30am and I didn't think anyone would answer the call so early on a Sunday morning, it was answered by a manager named Jennifer who was VERY helpful. She said that they DID have the wallet and that he could come and pick it up right away although the restaurant wasn't open yet. He said she was helpful and friendly throughout the exchange and that he feels like going there more often just because of the service and attitudes of all of the employees that he came into contact with both last night (Nicole when he picked up the food) and today (Jennifer).

268,RJ W.,"Camarillo, CA",0,56,,3.0,2013-05-09,"We went to the Cheesecake Factory last night to celebrate my daughter's 12th birthday. It was her choice and she wanted to sit in the ""mall area"". You can either sit in the restaurant, the outdoor patio or the seats that are in the mall. We mentioned the birthday to the hostess and she made sure that she got the details. Our server came over and immediately wished the kid a happy birthday. It was nice. Our drink order was immediately taken and the waitress handled it quickly. She also came back to take our dinner order but we were not quite ready. It seemed to take her a while to come back but they were busy. It was not absurdly long so I was OK with it. Once the orders went in, the food came out promptly. All three kids had different pasta dishes (two ordered off adult menu). My son's fettuccine Alfredo was SWIMMING in butter. I am sure it tasted OK, but I was not excited about his losing a year or two on the back end of his life. I had a burger. It was slightly cold. I was not in the mood to send anything back, so I ate it. Found out later the birthday girl's was cold also. The fries were lukewarm also. I am guessing the waitress would have taken care of it, but I did not say a word. It was my kids birthday, we were having fun and my beer was ice cold so I was willing to overlook. Because we were celebrating a birthday we got a complimentary sundae which was REALLY small. Don't count on that to share. We also ordered cheesecake (when in Rome, right?). My wife got original, son got Oreo Dream  something or other, and birthday girl got vanilla bean. Gave the sundae to the youngest. Cheesecake was amazing. The Oreo one was so rich my ten year old took home half. So 5 people (one off kid menu), one beer involved and 3 cheesecakes was 119 with tip. I didn't check but I suspect the cheesecake was a tad pricey, but it was my kids birthday.

We were only halfway through eating...we tipped and left sans dessert because of how disgusted we were.

520,Hannah W.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",46,96,86.0,3.0,2014-02-05,"My girlfriend and I came here last night for a girls night and it was absolutely astonishing how horrible the customer service was.  We were sitting at our table for LITERALLY 20 minutes before we had to personally ask someone to take our drink orders. And it was pretty funny to us to watch not one, not two, but THREE servers in one section not realize for 20 minutes that we were just sitting there waiting to be served. - I don't care if that wasn't someone's section, you hop on helping a table no matter what, its MONEY.  After requesting our drink orders from a server I believe was named Jessica (who was very sweet and apologetic for noticing we were just sitting there not served. And this was after we asked for a manager), she was very attentive even though we weren't her assigned table. My friend and I wished we were her table because she was a lot nicer than the snob of a server we were dealt with.  The manager was great too, he made sure to get us our appetizer immediately and free of charge. I think my only main complaint besides waiting for 20 minutes before being noticed, was our server. It's funny because she was never once sympathetic that SHE was actually supposed to be our server and never noticed but she had the worst attitude of all time. She acted like it was a pitty to serve us and she really didn't want to. She was never once attentive to us, we had bus boys and other servers and the manager serving us and refilling our drinks before she could even think to get to doing that. Then after we ordered our cheesecake it took her ANOTHER 20 minutes flat to get us our check. Even after saying the cheesecake was all we wanted left, no coffee, no more drinks. A great server would have given us our check after that...but nope!  And it wasn't until she gave us our check that she finally said ""And I'm sorry for the mishap in the beginning"" in hopes that she would get a tip. HAHA!!!! I'm sorry, but I am a customer who highly praises exceptional customer service and I will definitely reward you for that. But she definitely didn't earn a cent extra of my money.

I recently came here with my boyfriend on a Tuesday night, and they continue to have that amazing customer service.  One of my favorite things about this particular location is the option to sit on the inside patio, outside patio, bar and regular dining.  It's no wonder this place is packed from open to close on the weekends and most weeknights.

Gross.  Also these mac n cheese balls were WAY too much cheese.  Taking one in half you could barely pick out the pasta visually.  It just looked like all melted cheese.  Fried coating was tasty though.  I ate 90% of one and got a to-go box for the other three.  :( Chocolate Mouse Cheesecake was good.  Rich flavor, but not too sweet.  the best part was the dark chocolate shavings on top.  When I finally got to those, they really made the flavor pop. They should have included more of those and maybe the whipped cream only on the side (on top it totally overpowered the chocolate shavings).

We ordered the chicken and biscuits which was advertised as sautéed chicken breasts with pan jus...what came out were 4 paper thin 2 inch x 2 inch slivers of dried out crispy (as in overcooked, not fried) pieces of chicken in a weird lemony flavored gravy. It was gross and so was the biscuit, which was also dry but strangely sweet. The entire dish had a really weird after taste and was sent back. Next up was a side of mac and cheese...usually pretty hard to mess up, unless you severely undercook the pasta and the sauce breaks...fail #2! This one sat uneaten at the edge of the table, seemingly unnoticed by the staff who never inquired as to why it was just sitting there across from us, uneaten.

214,Alex S.,"Oxnard, CA",0,2,,1.0,2014-09-12,"My last visit to Cheesecake Factory in Thousand Oaks was the worst dining and service experience I have ever had. I mention Thousand Oaks because I frequent the Sherman Oaks location and have always had a good experience. I am a pretty understanding person and being that I work in the service industry, can relate;however, the only explanation I have is that I was discriminated against. This experience has forever changed my perception of the company and I will never return but I believe it's my duty to share it with you. After arriving and being informed of a ""15"" min wait time, I was seated after 1hr15min, only because I surfaced my concern as I witnessed 4-5 groups of all sizes that arrived after me get seated first. I even stood by the greeter after she told me I was next. After another 2 groups were seated I looked at the greeter and she said it was okay and assured me my table was being prepared. Another 2 groups were seated and the greeter tells me my she is sorry but my table was given away. I hope you can understand my frustration and dismay. I am a  male Hispanic with 2 female Hispanics, celebrating a birthday after work. We are well dressed and I can't find another reason or explanation. I don't think competence could have taken it this far.  Finally we were seated at a what seemed to be a remote location within the Resturant that was almost empty(4-5 empty tables). The server wasn't much better than the greeter( drinks were never refilled). Anyways, this experience has taken enough of my time but I truly hope others don't have to share this same experience, drive to Sherman Oaks.

For a few years after I made this my bread and butter. This was the spot to take a girl on a date in my teens, then something happened, I don't know what..and I stopped coming here all together. Well I made my comeback and it was just as good as I remember it! When I got there I requested side by side seating regardless of the wait. It didn't take longer than 10 minutes before I got the confirmation text (no more vibrating pagers).  Eh the hostesses weren't too friendly but they didn't come off as rude either, just indifferent. Smile a little more!    After being seated ""Matthew B."" introduced himself as our waiter. He was friendly enough and never left us waiting long for anything we asked for! Food: BREAD: They bring you a basket with sourdough and whole grain bread (at least that's what I think it is) it's the dark one in the picture. Honestly if you're into the whole sourdough thing cool but my my my how I love the whole grain one. It's got a taste of it's own that it leaves you wanting more and more and more and more.4.5/5 CAESAR SALAD: The caesar salad was good enough for a side salad. The size of it was the smallest one yet 2 people are easily able to eat from it. A lot of cheese which is good because it helped it stay balanced with the dressing. Lettuce quality was fresh for the most part. 3.5/5 AMERICANA BURGER W/BACON: Ordered it medium and it was cooked to perfection! I really enjoyed my burger. The ""secret sauce"" added a good flavor to it..I added some bbq sauce to it too which went well with the whole bacon aspect of it. 4/5 FRIES: These fries were good. Nothing worth hyping up but a tad bit better than the fries that accompany a burger at any other chain restaurant. Their ranch is good so if that's you're dipping sauce you should be left satisfied with them. 3.5/5 CHICKEN PICCATA: The chicken was meh. A bit dry and needed to be more lemony. But the pasta was great! It was cooked well and the sauce and herbs came together nicely to give a satisfying taste. 3.5/5 Drinks: STRAWBERRY LEMONADE: It's the must thing to order if you don't plan on having alcohol in your system. It's a good strawberry lemonade. The sugar around the cup is always a good touch..if you are really trustworthy of the dishwashers of course! 4.5/5 Alcoholic Drinks: Don't judge me on the selections, I can drink ""manly"" drinks too..I promise. GEORGIA PEACH: This is one of the best frozen drinks that I have tasted in my life. It was really really really really good! Matthew recommended it and it didn't disappoint. The raspberry swirl gave it that edge that put it above average. Must order!! 5/5 MAI TAI: Ehh too sweet. That's all there is to say. Avoid it. 1/5 Dessert: CHEESECAKE WITH GLAZED STRAWBERRIES: It was good. The cheesecake wasn't extremely rich but it didn't taste like your average vons cheesecake either. There are sooooooooooo many options to choose from so I shouldn't have gone too conventional here but I did. Either way it was a solid dessert. 3.5/5 I like this place. It was 74$ for everything mentioned above. Which is more than fair considering their portions are big! I saw a lot bad reviews for their customer service which wasn't bad to me. You just have to be more wordy I suppose. They get busy so just let them know what you expect from the beginning and there shouldn't be a problem with your experience there. I'd say their service was okay overall though..definitely something to improve upon. I RECOMMEND picking booth seating regardless of the wait..it's just more intimate and it lets you feel like you're in your own private area.  Go to the Cheesecake Factory at least once if you never have. Their menu is full of options. I'm glad I came back. It was kind of like when you see that ex after a few years and you realize how hot she is and hit yourself on the head for letting her go. I'll definitely try to integrate The Cheesecake Factory more into my restaurant rotation. Even more so now because I'm sure Miley Cyrus is past Cheesecake Factory's..which is good..means better odds that licking that sugar off the strawberry lemonade cup is less dangerous!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-thousand-oaks?start=100,3.92,3.87,3.87,3.088,3.89

Back in the days of the big beefy ribs, salad bar and yes, even back then, lines out the door.    About 25 years ago, I settled on the Factory Burger as my ""go to"" meal and that was pretty much the only thing I ordered.  Last night, after being away for about a year, I returned to what I thought would be another satisfying meal... even if I had to wait 30-40 minutes.  Well, I was incredibly disappointed.  We had a party of 4, and although we were seated reasonably quick and the appetizer came out without incident, the main course (two burgers, a salad and an order of sliders took almost 40 minutes and came out at two separate times....and it wasn't even that busy.  To top it off, the meal itself was disappointing.  The burgers were blah, the chinese chicken salad was missing the dressing and was not at all what it used to be, the sliders lacked interest, and one waitress (not our main server) asked if one of our party wanted more coffee when it was clear there was a pot of water on the table and a tea bag in the cup.  Yes, the Manager came over to apologize when the Server discovered and reported to him that our food was extra slow in coming and only half had actually made it to the table... and he did ultimately make an accommodation for the poor service, but even so, after so many years doing the same thing over and over, this restaurant should have been running like a well oiled machine... and that includes the B team.  The only thing I can think of to create such a miserable meal is that the kitchen must have had the losers from Hell's Kitchen running the show because something was definitely wrong back there.  I never thought I'd be writing a negative review for TCF, but this was by far the worst experience I've had in over 25 years as a customer and has probably been the experience to put the nail in the coffin for future meals here.  There are just too many other choices in the area now to go back for another miserable experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-thousand-oaks?start=520,3.64,3.84,3.84,2.7560000000000002,3.76

The exterior was perfectly crunchy and the inside had a heavenly custardy interior.  My brother got breakfast potatoes on the side of his eggs and bacon and I'll have to agree with his assessment that they looked and tasted like they came straight out of a freezer bag and into the deep fryer.

133,J.Steve I.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,12,,1.0,2015-01-24,"Once again another terrible experience at the Thousand Oaks CheeseCake Factory. I swore tha last time I was mistreated there that I would never go back, but unfortunately my daughter and her fiancé had a gift card they wanted to take advantage of, and we were celebrating a belated birthday for my daughter.  The following was a comedy of errors and screw-ups that made for an extremely frustrating experience. To keep tis short and succinct I will simply list them. 1) specified to the hostess we wished to eat inside. (as it was blowing 20 knots outside) 2) when we finally were notified we had a table the first hostess could not find our res.  3) after the first hostess abandoned us, the second tried to lead us to a table outside! when we told her we had asked for a table inside, she told us it would be another 20 minute wait!  4) 40 minutes later, we are led to a bar booth barely big enough for 4. they stick a chair on the end of the table, in the middle of the aisle directly adjacent to the entrance to the bar area. (I might as well have been seated in the middle of the freeway. 5) wait forever to get 2 beers, while sitting 10 feet from the bar 6) when we finally get our drinks the waiter forgets straws, we ask for straws and then don't see him for another 15 minutes. Finally ask a passing waiter for some straws, he walks 10 feet away and gets the straws. 7) the table is cluttered with 5 services and I try to flag a waiter to clear some of the extraneous junk, and even after yelling at a passing waiter finally have to remove the stuff myself and dump it at a wait station. 8) our first order of starters arrive and because of the lack of space I have to get up and stand back so the waiter can serve.  9) I have never had this next one happen before.... A waiter comes to our table and asks us if they can bring our entrees to the table because they are up in the ""window"" (even though the starters have only been on the table a few minutes.) We figure we can stand that and agree. A moment later the entrees arrive and it becomes glaringly clear that there is not enough room at the table for all the plates. I am forced to stand up and step back again while the servers figure out the mess on our table. I want to point out that I have not ordered an entree. I remark to the waiter that if I had, where would I have put my plates? And further point out that 5 people should never be seated at a 4 place table! He mutters something about ""we do it all the time"" I am now furious. 10) some guy who does not identify himself, comes over and asks, "" Is there something I can help you with?"" I am so angry I can barely speak! Fortunately my future son-in-law calmly explains to him how poorly we have been treated. The ""manager?"" apologizes about 50 times but offers nothing more than to seat us somewhere else in the middle of our dinner!!!!!  This same guy trips over the back of my chair later and makes no remark...... I have lived in this valley for over 50 years. I used to play on the property that this restaurant occupies. When the mall was constructed and The Cheesecake Factory opened we thought we had hit the big time. Sadly, in my experience, it is run like a cafeteria, the only thing they care about is stuffing you in the joint and then making sure you get out as fast as you can.

THEN when we showed up at the counter (myself, my hubby and my 83 year old mom) they told us, oh yeah, ok, stand over there, against a WALL in a narrow passageway by a bunch of strollers, with wait staff trying to squeeze by with plates of food. Which would have been ok, but then we Waited and Waited, and another family got beeped, and they told THEM to wait against the same wall, and then another family 5 minutes later, and here we all were squished against the wall.   I watched a waitress count out menus and thought here we go, but then she put them back and walked aimlessly in another direction.  My mom was having a hard time standing there so long, we would have been better off waiting where we were on the benches.  Finally I went up to the front desk and said our number was called and we were told to wait over here in the hallway, and my mom is having a hard time standing over here so long! So they said oh sure we will seat you right now.  Jeez, you would think when they call and say your table is ready that your table would really be ready, not that you would be shuffled off to another waiting area.  Horrible.

We chose to eat outside and got the table under lovely tree. Because it was Father's Day, I decided to go to heck with myself and ignore calories and potential health consequences of the meal. My wife and I decided to share the Bruleed French Toast and the Chorizo Avo Omelet. The French toast consisted of two large pieces of bread that were each about an inch thick. It came with syrup to put on it, but the syrup really wasn't needed. Even without the syrup, it was rich and sweet and incredibly delicious. By far the best French toast I've ever had. I came into the restaurant really hungry, and by the time I finished my half of the French toast, I could've quit eating for the rest of the day, it was that filling. The omelette was also really very tasty. However I was so stuffed from the French toast, I was barely able to eat half of my half of the omelette before I had to stop.

I went with the stuffed chicken tortillas (that's fancy talk for enchiladas). The portion was huge, I ate about 1/3 of my meal and took the rest home for midnight snack.

The hosts used to give you pager type thing, where you weren't able to go within a certain amount of feet, or else it wouldn't work. But now, they ask for your cell number so they can text you when your table is ready.  Once we were seated, we had plenty of time to look at our menu and pick out the dishes we wanted. I knew my hubs would want the buffalo blasters for an appetizer and cheesecake for dessert, so I chose to get a side tossed salad. I used to LOVE their salad but was disappointed with the croutons. They used to season it which gave the salad the right amount of freshness and flavor without the salad dressing, but this time, my salad only came with a sliver of a crouton. When I asked for more, the waitress brought out a nice small dish full, but when I tasted it, I felt like I was biting into straight up oil! It actually ruined the salad. But the buffalo blast was greasy and delicious and so was the cheesecake my hubs ordered-apple crumb.  My hubs ordered the lunch portion of shepherds pie, which tasted bland to me, but my hubs seemed to like it. The portion it self was pretty big, which was nice for what you pay.

I have been to many cheesecake factories before and I am a fan of how big their menu is. It's almost endless! And I'm not just talking about their cheesecake menu. This cheesecake is conveniently located right at a corner of the Thousand Oaks mall. You can shop while you are waiting for a text for your table to be ready so I think that is pretty cool. The service at the place is very good and I really need to mention a waiter here that is probably one of the best waiters for Cheesecake Factory in general. His name is Joel and this guys knows the menu inside and out. My friend and I always ask for him to help us because not only he is so attentive he makes us laugh every time because he describes their specials and food and desserts in ways that he is on some food network showing off his masterpiece.

0,Lene N.,"East Bay, CA",1432,853,4296.0,4.0,2016-02-24,"I may be a little bias when it comes to Cheesecake Factory because it was one of my first ""real jobs"" out of high school, grand opening the location in Pleasanton, CA- and at the time I thought Cheesecake Factory was the best thing ever created aside from sliced bread. Although CCF is a corporate chain and every store goes through the same extensive training on the food and how to provide exceptional customer service, not every location has the same customer service,  and the only thing that is constant is the food.  The CCF in The Oaks mall in Thousand Oaks is truly hit or miss when it comes to the customer service. One day we can get someone that actually practices the training they were taught and one day we can get someone that probably shouldn't be working in the restaurant industry. Either way, this is the closest CCF to our home, so that is why continue to come here. I really enjoy this location because who doesn't enjoy a good meal including dessert after a great day of shopping? I enjoy sitting outside on their outdoor dinning area, indulging in a great piece of cheesecake. Sometimes sitting on one of the tables inside overlooking the mall entrance is fun, so you can people watch.  Almost always this place will have a minimum wait time of at least 30 minutes so be prepared.  My favorite all time dish has been the Chicken Piccata with a side of angel hair pasta. I've never been a fan of capers until this dish. Capers are like an olive and are sprinkled throughout this pasta dish. The chicken is slightly seared and perfectly seasoned. The pasta is al dente all the time. I love this dish!  For my cheesecake, the three that I love is the White Chocolate Truffle Raspberry, Tiramisu and the other is Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cheesecake. All are absolutely delish!   Cheesecake Factory makes a great date night spot without breaking the bank. Also the location is great with different seating options: indoor, outdoor or indoor along the mall. I would recommend CCF to everyone...

It's the typical wait at this location, 30-45 mins on a Saturday afternoon, so we got our pager & waited. We get seated & our takes our drink as well as our food order since we looked at the menu as we waited.   The bread & drinks took a lot longer than usual to arrive, about 10 minutes, usually we receive both in about 3-5 mins even on their busiest day. We get our food, miso salmon, grilled pork chop, & I got the bang bang chicken/shrimp. At first everything looked good I start eating & it's delicious. But as I start to poke around, I noticed that I got the chicken but no shrimp to be seen. I call the waiter over to let him know of the issue, he apologize, but didn't offer to have the dish sent back to be remade. I continue to eat my dish as I hate cold food then 10-13 minutes later, he comes back w/ a little bowl of the tiniest shrimp you'll ever see & I was about half way done w/ my cold food as I had to wait for the shrimp. The shrimp was not the shrimp that comes w/ the dish, it was just sauteed in oil & seasoning, not the normal Thai sauce. To add to insult, the shrimp was completely overcooked & still had shells I had to spit out.   At this point I was extremely disappointed, as everyone's dish came out perfectly & here I was looking like an idiot waiting for the worlds tiniest shrimps. Although the server was apologetic, in no way did he correct the issue the right way. I was expecting the entree to be discounted or at the least a free dessert, but no, he just rushed the check to us & shoved us on our way as if nothing happened. On top of the check taking again an unusually long time, I had 2 gift cards I wanted to use & even then he screwed that up by charging the card w/ the most credit first so I'm still stuck w/ 2 cards instead of 1. If I wanted to, I could make all the dishes that were served to us today, but we go out for the dining experience. The food & the waiter are part of that experience, & today, both of those failed.   We will most likely come back as this is the closest CF in 50 miles, but I just won't order ""complicated"" dishes in the future as today tainted my experience for that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-thousand-oaks?start=200,3.84,3.56,3.68,3.2720000000000002,3.672

I recently became a Vegan and finding places that I can eat is a challenge. I wasn't sure if this Cheese Cake Factory location could help me. I asked a waiter if they could modify the classic Chinese Chicken Salad for me and he directed me to someone at bakery.     I asked the guy behind the desk named Kevin to help me with the modification of this salad and also to see if the price would change. Since the chicken would be the most expensive part of this dish. He said they could remove the chicken but not change the price. I arrived in the evening and this salad is $17.00 .  A little too expensive for some lettuce and dressing. His attitude was lousy and he had a ""don't care"" response. I decided to leave the restaurant.      As I was walking away very dis-satisfied with the service and the price, I decided to return to see if the manager could help me. I returned to Kevin and asked him if I could speak to the manager. He came out and I asked him the same question regarding the chicken and lower price. He said Yes they could change the price and he went to the back to speak to the kitchen manager for price difference.    I ended up getting the salad for much cheaper and same size as the dinner plate. If I would have left with the response from Kevin, I would not have gotten a better service and what I actually wanted.  This attentive and compassionate manager understood how hard it is to eat out being a Vegan and gave me exceptional service.    I left very happy but remembered I did not get the receipt from the cashier Lauren and she was just like Kevin, had a very poor customer service attitude. Why work directly with customers when you do not have good people skills. This place could be losing business to employees like this.

We ordered cocktails and our server was quite pleasant and helpful. However after we ordered dinner and more cocktails our server left for the evening and we were introduced to our new server Savannah. From the get go she was unpleasant and made us feel unwelcomed! What a sad difference from our previous server. We tried to make small talk and engage her but she was rude. I made a comment about my drink "" evaporating"" and that I would like to order another. She right away gave me a dirty look and so I told her who our DD was and that I was not driving. I again explained that we were going to a movie and I was not driving. She said nothing and walked away. Next thing I know she has the manager walk over my cocktail to see if I was ok. The manager was very professional and explained that this was my 4th cocktail in 2 hours and they would be liable if I fell or something. We chatted for a bit and he was satisfied that I was not drunk and gave me my cocktail. He also offered to extend the happy hour price for me. Savannah came back and was completely rude, dismissive and has no business working the bar area if she is going to pass judgement on people! If she had taken the time to chat and ask questions she would have been satisfied that we were not out of control. The icing on the cake is when we had a gentleman join us and all of a sudden she had a personality and actually chatted with him.

I gotta preface this by saying I've worked as a server at Cheesecake Factory AND Rock Sugar. So I get it, I get it all. It's been years since I've worked for this company, and the food is still the best.  Everyone was great but there were a few things that really stood out and are worth mentioning. First was our busboy. I think he had blue eyes and a lite beard- he was gorgeous. He worked hard the entire night, lighting different heaters (which most people don't recognize is a pain) but his movement was just very graceful. He should be working at Mastro's. He even offered to box up my food for me, which I thought was a nice touch and a surprise. Never in my 4 years of working for that company did a busboy offer to box up food for one of my tables.  I mean, he really should be serving. Come to think of it, watching him, he probably was a server but just working a bus-boy shift for the night. I wish I would have found out his name, but if a manager is reading this, you'll know who I'm talking about. Also, I noticed another server from inside the restaurant came out to help with the heaters and I thought that was a surprise. If i recall the restaurant isn't a pooled house, so that was nice that he took time away from his work to help out.

However, the host tried to seat us right in between tables that were so close to other guests we might as well have been eating together. My friend requested politely to move just a table over to give us and the tables besides us a little more privacy since it was very slow and quiet. We got major attitude right away. Being in our early 20's, Danielle N immediately judged us rather than treating us kindly and providing decent service. She did nothing special to make us feel welcome or enjoy our dinner, not even a smile. Being a waitress myself, I know what good service is. This was piss poor. My friend asked that her salad that came with the entree to be boxed up to go when we ordered, but Danielle clearly didn't listen because she had the entire order boxed so my friend had to ask for a plate. Danielle didn't even recognize her mistake or apologize for it as she watched my friend move her entree from a box to a dine in plate... She also was extremely unprofessional and laughed when refilling our water glasses because of something a coworker had said. Have some class and compose yourself before walking over to a table.

The fried crab bites appetizer I had from Cheesecake Factory by my girlfriend down in Artesia the other day seriously had larger chucks of crab in it than these. Those were good, yet the actual crab cakes here were pretty tasteless and overcooked. The other dishes our party had included avocado toast. I guess that's still technically correct since they burned the ends off of it similar to the crab cakes. I'm told it was really good last time we were here, but even the toppings are different too. Last time it had watercress and this time it had arugula which was a big disappointment for the person who loved it last time. The Butter Roasted Carrots and Pecans were actually just steamed carrots without pecans. I guess they fixed it when asked at least though the carrots  were obviously still not roasted. The Shepherds pie was good, but smaller than before as well. I'm not too picky about food and I really hate complaining about it or trying to send anything back in a restaurant, but honestly I am probably going to go home and make some Costco crabcakes for myself right after this. All in all we were all inclined to believe the issue lies with the particular chef tonight since the food was good in the past so  we might be back to give it another shot, but damn it was abysmal this time.

She must have realized she was out of line because she did apologize for her behavior.  However, when we left, my niece accidentally left one of her cards with a gift card at the table. We had been standing outside for now longer than 10 minutes before we realized. I went back in to ask about it and she went to the back and came out to say, ""No sorry. I have an honest staff, so it's probably in the trash."" Ummm, okay so go check. That's your job. If it's in the trash it will still be on top!  As a manager in a Cheesecake Factory, one of your biggest responsibilities is CUSTOMER SERVICE! The manager tonight needs some serious training in how not to be a jerk.  I understand it was my 11 year old niece that mistakenly left the card, but the excuse should not be, ""we're honest here and it's probably in the trash.""

First time, they swiped my credit card TWICE and charged me double. I did not find out until my card statements came out and I did not even get an apology from the manager. Second time coming here, I called and ordered for curbside. (I have my receipt for proof and details) I wanted to treat my mom to her favorite food, so I ordered nachos with NO jalapeños and waited 45 MINS for simple nachos (it wasn't even busy) and then called again. (I was told it would only be 15 mins)  I was put on a five minute hold and then they told me my food was ready all along, and they will bring it out right away. (50 min wait now) I was already tight on time, hence me calling ahead and ordering.  Apparently ""right away"" means five+ more minutes. So I gave up and just went inside and got the food myself, without receiving any apologies. As if that wasn't enough, my nachos were cold and soggy and they put jalapeños in them, which my mom bit into and did not have water in the car.  It was late and we lived out of town so we skipped dinner that night.  For a pricey and formal looking place, your employees sure need more experience.

Really just depends when you go.  There is always a wait in the evenings to be seated. Usually quite a bit of a wait. Though they did just finish their outdoor patio area which adds a decedent amount of seating.  I will note the Lemon Garlic Shrimp with angel hair pasta is very tasty.

Tonight though I strayed from my normal order and had the Shrimp Scampi & Herb Salmon Combo. I was hugely disappointed! the 3 Shrimp were ok and a nice size, but the salmon was tiny and totally overcooked (being a combo I expected smaller portions, but the salmon was so small and I think because of the size they seriously overcooked it) My kids enjoyed their food, but I was so disappointed that the salmon was not worth eating. I debate saying anything to the waitress, but did. Our waitress Savhanna was right away apologetic and offered to have another plate made, but I declined.  We ordered 2 desserts to go and while waiting someone I assume was a Manager came over to check on us about my food and said he would take care of it.

My wife and I have been frequenting this location for over a decade now and she loves cheesecake factory - or I should say - ""loved"" until last night. My wife and our party had the worst birthday celebration experience! It is especially unfortunate that it was at our local location that we have been coming to for years!! We had a party of 7 and the night started off ok with pleasant introductory service, however that's where it all ended and went downhill from here;  A couple of entrees were incorrectly served, my order was sent to a different table and therefore I had to wait an additional 20 minutes while everyone else finished their food. I didn't blame the waitress as she was apologetic and did offer a comped appetizer. And after all that  long wait -  the shrimp bistro entrée was bitter and spoiled. I had about 3 spoonful's and just gave up! The waitress noticed and asked if I wanted something else but I was tired and didn't want to complain and wait again after a long day! The waitress finally came back and I had to ask for the dessert menu, but the straw that broke the camels back was when I explicitly told the server that it was my wife's birthday 3 different times during the night!!!!! After the painfully slow and unpleasant service; the waitress brought our desserts- quickly placing them on the table and then disappeared - bringing no clean plates or utensils. I had to flag down a different waiter for the clean plates after my party was waiting for over 10 minutes as the lit birthday candle was melting! Horrible!!! To make it worse - we were waiting for the customary birthday recognition from the staff, but no one showed! I expressed my dissatisfaction with the waitress and she just replied: its late at night and we are just all over the place, showing no concern or apology especially after I was significantly patient and courteous with her.  But that's not where it ends! I finally asked for the manager to rectify this horrendous experience for my wife and her party of guests.  Cameron  P. - was the most rudest, condescending and unapologetic manager I have ever met, especially being in the hospitality industry!  I explained to him of our issue! I had to express 3 times that we had a birthday celebration in our party and we were completely mistreated and dissatisfied with our reception for this supposed memorable experience. He showed no sympathy or apology stating that he was not aware  and simply stated that he will comp one desert. WOW!!! Really?!? I didn't even bring up my spoiled dish until now and he stated that ""if you ate it, then I have to charge you!""   WOWWWWWW!!!!!!!! I seriously asked if this is how he is going to end the experience ? His response: "" if you didn't like the service, you don't have to leave a tip!"" LMFAO!!!!!!!! REALLY!!!!!???????   Obviously he was severely uncompassionate about the principals of celebrations and memories!!!! But being the manager, if your employee dropped the ball - you are expected to pick it back up and maintain the brand! But guess what? It still didn't end there! To add insult to injury - a table in front of us had a birthday recognition from all the staff! I told the manager - but no sympathy, no apology! Just arrogant demeanor!  Thanks Management! You just made the franchise lose guests that have been coming to this local location for over a decade! You personally didn't ruin the night - but as a senior manager, you were responsible for the brand representation and rectification of the horrendous experience and unfortunate memory with our guests!

374,Rachelle B.,"Honolulu, HI",0,15,,1.0,2017-11-23,"Bought a cheesecake for Thanksgiving from here. Asked when we picked it up yesterday when to thaw it. He told us 4-6 hours in a fridge. So this morning I take the cheesecake out of the freezer and put it in the fridge to thaw. 7 hours later I pull it out and it's still partially frozen and the strawberries on top are mostly frozen. It's frustrating to pay so much money for cheesecake and have an employee give you the wrong information so you end up not having dessert to serve after Thanksgiving dinner. I guess I should have researched the info instead of asking the employe, I just assumed he would know. I looked up the info after I realized my cheesecake wasn't fully thawed and according to the website it says to allow  8-12 hours.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-thousand-oaks?start=60,2.88,3.23,3.392,,3.09
396,Brown Eyes B.,"Studio City, CA",1,39,,2.0,2017-11-25,Food pretty good but service is a let down every time. Management does not seem to care. They just make up excuses for the servers. Asked manager to get us a new server after complaining but she did not do so after few complaints from other tables too.  Again we complained 2nd time and said we did not feel comfortable with her serving us after complaining. Manager just told us not to worry about it.  Shows poor man agents skills. Can't expect good service if management does not care. She thought offering a free cheesecake makes up for it after a whole disaster lunch with numerous tables of complaints.  I don't care about a cheese cake you offered. I would have appreciated if she actually care about the customers. We did not feel comfortable eating the rest of our meals because we didn't want the service to do anything to our food after complaints. We paid for meals we did not feel comfortable eating thanks to management not taking appropriate action.

It is been quite sometime since we've visited this restaurant. We were hoping that the food quality, service was up to their standard as in the past. We were unfortunately mistaken. It is always disappointing when the restaurant Makes the conscious decision to reduce food quality in order to improve profits. Never again, I will not be burned twice. The comment by guest services is a typical, comment from a company that no longer cares about the quality of their product.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-thousand-oaks,2.72,3.18,3.376,,2.9960000000000004
395,Cassandra M.,"Newbury Park, CA",61,49,21.0,1.0,2017-12-12,"Worst experience we didn't even stay to eat. We went to go and eat in the mall portion of this restaurant. Walking to your table you feel like you are walking on sawdust or peanuts... only it isn't a restaurant that does that, so when you look down it is actually crumbs of food. You get the leftovers from the many costumers, before you get to the table! Yum!  The first table we were going to sit at was already set but had not been wiped down, more leftovers! Second table looked clean and the floor had very little evidence of people missing their mouths. When I opened the menu I got a prize and not one you get in a cereal box...leftover bread crumbs from the previous consumer! Well I know I wanted bread, but this was just ridiculous. Some bird would have been extremely happy with the feast that lay on the clean plate and my lap. PLEASE tell Mary Poppins to feed the birds at the park! I had lost my appetite at this time but the people I was with were hungry, so I told them I wouldn't eat. If it couldn't get any worse, I noticed my spoon. It had some sort of whipped cream or creamy sauce on the spoon. Thank goodness I saw this before inserting someone else's DNA into my mouth, did they use mouth wash today...? I hope so! Again I wish the Cheesecake Factory would give me some fresh food that ""I"" ordered! We left after the spoon, we were not going to chance eating something we didn't order (crumbs, sauce on the spoon). If you like to live on the edge and see what kind of leftovers lands on your plate before ordering... GO FOR IT!  My suggestion bring your own silverware, look up the menu on your phone, pack a mini vacuum, vitamin c tablets, and a bucket in case you some how get sick from all the extra unwanted leftovers you are about to eat. My fear is the sitting areas looked like this, can you imagine the kitchen?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-thousand-oaks,2.72,3.18,3.364,,2.9960000000000004
404,Mona L.,"Westlake Village, CA",11,151,20.0,4.0,2017-12-23,"I was shocked that this place wasn't rated better on Yelp. I've very rarely been disappointed. The menu selection can't be beat, the food always tastes great and quality is always decent of not great. The service varies, but is rarely terrible.. usually good or great. The wait can be a bummer, it's hard when the place is at the mall, but it's always been worth the wait. Very kid friendly- and it's always been somewhat easy to eat here when I'm on one of my new diets.

406,Janine F.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,26,5.0,2.0,2017-12-24,"Poor service for the price. This chain has managerial issues. Other locations offer the same sub-par service, so I think it's the fault of disorganized management. For example 1 waiter got 4 tables that arrived at the same time. Pretty sure we all felt ignored. It's Christmas Eve, so I was hoping to make some good memories. A busy holiday may not be perfect but we came at a slow time and service was still painfully lacking. After consistently neglectful service, I spoke with a manager and still left feeling like I wasted my money.

362,Sande M.,"Newbury Park, CA",36,77,,2.0,2017-12-28,Absolutely disappointed. Cobb salad came with no salad dressing. The beet & goat cheese salad for almost $7.00 - 2 pieces of goat cheese almost no salad. Didn't even fill up a quarter of the container! And; I'm getting very offended at sales receipts that suggest I tip up to 22%. For a take-out order that most can't get right?? Seriously. Actually; this order for the price and quantity of food now; i.e. two small bread loafs for 3 people. really deserves less. Guess that's why their still open. Seeing a lot of the same comments apparently on this location.

7,D B.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,34,15.0,2.0,2017-12-31,"I am just putting up a review of the last two visits we have taken to this location December 18th and 30th, 2017. We waited over an hour for a table both times which was fine. They provide pagers and they extend into the mall.  You don't have to sit and wait in front of the restaurant.  It's the same as any Cheesecake Factory anywhere. The food choices, the ambiance, and service were all great. I don't know what happened at this location but the taste of the food these last two visits, one being just last night, were awful.  December 18th, 2017: My husband and I ordered the Chinese Chicken Salad and I like the Skinny Factory Salad. Neither salad was that usual Cheesecake Factory plump hearty salad. It seemed like portions were less.  They were both lame and just didn't taste as fresh as they should have.  Last night December 30th, 2017: The food was really bad. My husband order the Jambalaya Pasta and I ate Chicken Madeira.  These two dishes were terrible. The jambalaya veggies and shrimp were overcooked and burnt.  The top of the dish was all black. There was very little pasta in the bottom of the dish.  It was dry tasting. My husband was hungry so he just ate it. Not good at all.  My chicken was burnt as well. I was eating charred chicken.  The mashed potatoes were not smashed enough.  Maybe these experiences are temporary and this location and can get it back eventually.  It was very busy both times but it's no excuse to serve food like this and for the price it shouldn't be substandard. I'm hoping a manager takes note of this review and can make improvements to the kitchen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-thousand-oaks?start=40,2.52,3.06,3.344,,2.8440000000000003
