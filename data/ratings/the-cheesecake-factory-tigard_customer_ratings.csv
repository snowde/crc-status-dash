The cheesecake is pretty good.  I shared the banana cream cheesecake with my friend (we got it to go), and it was delicious. It was a good sized slice, (plus extra whip cream and banana slices), for the both of us to share; however, I think that $7-$8 for a slice of cheesecake is a little pricey. Sorry cheesecake factory.

313,Jeff H.,"Salem, OR",91,270,9.0,2.0,2012-01-24,"I debated two or three stars, and even though I didn't actively hate The Cheesecake Factory, I was just underwhelmed for what I got.

736,Sushane G.,"Beaverton, United States",0,20,2.0,5.0,2012-02-08,"First of all, the Cheesecake Factory is considered to be the ""Worst Restaurant in America"" in terms of nutrition-  .  But don't let that stop you from indulging in this heavenly place. The ambiance is nice, the service is nice, the seating options are nice (inside or outside- outside tables even have heaters!), and the wait is very moderate.  Only like 15 minutes and with the mall being right there, it was not a problem. I've had never really ""dined"" here in the sense that all I ever sat down and ate prior to Tuesday was the Cheesecake.  But on Tuesday, with Cheesecakes being half off and I having over $70 in gift cards, decided to sit down and experience the entire dinner.  And it was great.  The menu is huuuuge.  For the appetizer, I went with the fried avocado rolls, apparently one of their specialties, and it was awesome.  Very expensive, but truly something I'd never eaten before.  Tasted like a Chinese spring roll biting in but then immediately changed flavor to a more American taste.  For dinner, they have so many options that it's hard to decide what to get.  I was going to order from the Skinnylicious menu before I realized it's really the exact same thing as the normal menu except served in smaller portions, and hence cheaper.  So I ordered the normal veggie burger from the ""unhealthy menu"", probably having at least 800 calories, and it was delicious.  I also had some of the cheese pizza, which was excellent.   The desserts...  Before I even came, I knew was going to go with the cheesecake, but couldn't decide which one.  They are all extremely unhealthy, with some cakes having up to 1300-1500 calories in just one slice.  I didn't let that bother me and ultimately, I ordered the Godiva Cheesecake and split it.  It was a good thing I split it, because that thing was huge!  No one should be able to eat the entire thing after dinner and I'm not surprised it has that many calories.  For a four person family, you really only need two slices.  I also had some of the Tiramisu cheesecake, which was good, but nothing in comparison to the layered Godvida cake which was bursting with flavor.  I don't even remember what the layers were, but I remember it having a bottom brownie crust, a second layer consisting of cheesecake, actual Godiva chocolate in there somewhere, and topped with a bunch of whipped cream.   So yeah, excellent place.  And bill only came out to be $44 with tip for four people.  Pretty cheap considering we had no coupons.  Oh yeah, checked my weight the next day- not a single pound gained (hehe).",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=360,4.08,4.08,4.08,3.636,4.08
669,Rebecca W.,"San Diego, United States",20,249,42.0,3.0,2012-02-10,"The decor is incredible, the cheesecakes look incredible, the huge lines almost convince you that this place is incredible, but I dare say it's too much hype and not enough there to back it up. Sure the cheesecakes are decent, some are even great, but overall I find the cheesecakes from my local bakery to be much better. Many of the cheesecakes at the Factory are waaaaay toooo sweet!! Total sweetness overload!  The food is...meh. I mean, it's not horrible by any means, and it is better than a million other joints, but the prices are steep, portions WAAAAAY toooo big, and the food is nothing to rave about. I would rather pay a smaller fee and get a much smaller portion and would likely dine here more if there was more selection in the smaller portion sizes. Put all that together and factor in the long wait to get a table on most days and times, and then factor in that you have a server who is mega busy waiting on table and likely to be less attentive than servers at less crowded establishments and it just doesn't make much sense to me why this place is so popular. One kudo I have to give the local Factory though is good management. Managers do show their faces and address problems. That is a big deal in my book! This is a location we will dine at once ever year or so....no more.

324,Matt R.,"Portland, OR",44,44,4.0,4.0,2012-02-11,"Although this location adjoins to the mall, you'll forget all about that as you step inside.  The interior of the restaurant made me feel like I was back in Vegas. I really enjoyed the ""buffalo blasts"" for my appetizer. Chicken and cheese stuffed inside some delicious breading and deep-fried, with spicy buffalo sauce and/or blue cheese dressing to dip them in. The sauce was flavorful and not overwhelming, although I can always handle (and enjoy) the heat. Delicious. For the entree, I was served crusted chicken romano, with pasta underneath in a light red sauce. Very filling and no hint of being microwaved. Then....the cheesecake. Oh, the cheesecake. A slice of Hershey's Chocolate Bar Cheesecake was the perfect ending to the meal.  The only downer was my seat. Usually when I go to a restaurant, a booth is my preferred place to sit. We were instead put at a table, one side with a chair, the other with the cushioned booth. You know what I'm talking about. I took the chair. Oops. Mistake of the day. I like space when I'm eating, and I did not get space. Crammed in tight with nowhere to move. It didn't distract me much from the meal though.

We have been meaning to go for a couple years, and decided to finally try it.  We were seated VERY quickly. As in, we checked in and less than 5 minutes later were being taken to our table. Our waiter (named Donovan) asked us how we were, to which we replied good and that we had never been there before. His first warning: the menu is very big. As in, 20 pages and then a couple for the cheesecakes and drinks. They also had a ""skinnylicious"" menu, which were all under 590 calories and smaller portions. He recommended a few things, let us know about their loaded baked potato soup, and then excused himself to get us some water. After bringing the waters and taking down our orders for strawberry lemonade (which was the best we had ever had), we looked over the menu. As our server passed by with cheesecakes, he would stop and briefly show them to use, tell us which one it is, and explain what was in it. We finally decided on the chicken madeira and the soup for me, and my husband had the spicy cashew chicken. The soup was great, and although I ordered the cup, it was the size of a bowl. Definitely glad I didn't get the bowl. They might have brought me a trough! When he brought us our entrees, I was shocked at the size of the plate. Two pieces of chicken the size of my head, and a hefty serving of mashed potatoes. I wasn't wild over the sauce, but it was still very good. It also came with steamed asparagus, which was done perfectly. The mashed potatoes (made with red potatoes) were well seasoned. I barely made a dent in my food. My husbands chicken was spicy, but not overly so. He asked for the brown rice, which complimented the chicken wonderfully. He actually ate half of his plate. Thanks to the cheesecakes our server had shown us, it wasn't hard to decide which ones to get. My husband got Adam's peanut butter cup cheesecake, and I ordered the Banana cream. We very light and creamy, and a fairly large slice topped with whip cream (mine also had freshly sliced bananas on it).

This salad was the BEST I have ever ordered at any restaurant, EVER.  The LUAU Salad.  I love it when the lettuce isn't the main ingredient, but merely part of the whole!  This salad was loaded with tons of veggies, chicken, and mango.  Stacked on top are two GIANT wontons that cover the whole top.  The salad was way too big for me.

We arrived at 6pm on a Sunday evening, and had to wait for over an hour for a table. Once we were seated, it continued to go downhill. It is so loud, it was difficult to relax or communicate without shouting. It is so dark, it is really hard to read the menu.  While we were having our pre-dinner bread, we noticed that my spoon had food crusted on it, as did one of the plates. When presented to the waiter, his attitude was uncaring and he seemed annoyed by our concern.  The menu, while expansive is very random and the food choices are not paired well. For example, several dishes included a starch but not a vegetable. When we asked if my salmon came with a vegetable, the waiter simply said ""no"" and did not even offer any suggestions. Spaghetti did not include a salad, and once again no input from the waiter other than ""no"". The waiter told us that the items on the ""regular"" menu came in gigantic portions. However, the only things that were large were the plates and cheap starches such as potatoes and noodles. The meat and veggies were very very small portions.  Food was OK, but obviously prepackaged and reheated. Service was average at best, but we were forced into paying a 18% gratuity.

We where seated quickly (but it was an odd hous 4:30ish), our waitress was amazing, she went over what the specials/soups of the day where before we had to ask and wasn't fake at all and was extremely plesant. As for the food, we where brought bread to munch on, a small white french loaf and a small brown bread loaf with oats on the top, and they also brought butter pats.The menu was huge and they have a vey nice bar with plenty to choose from, they also have a new skinylicious menu for the ones watching their weight. We ordered the fried macaroni and cheese (extremely fatty and caloric i know but as i said, we indulged ourselves tonight), and it was amazing. The noodles where well cooked and not soggy or dry from being fried, the sauce was very flavorfull, and the breading kept everything together well. They put a cream marinara on the bottom of the plate for dipping and my family and i agreed that it was perfect with the macaroni balls, (did i say they where formed in four golf ball-sized portions on the plate? no? well now i did.) My dad ordered the fetutini alfredo with a side of sauteed spinach and the spinach was cooked only with a little butter, salt, and pepper in a cast iron pan. my dad said the pasta was well cooked in the alfredo, the sauce wasn't too thick or to runny and he said it stuck well to the pasta. I had a chipotle crispy chicken sandwich on a kaiser roll. the only thing chipotle about it was a mayo sauce.I agreed with my mom's following notes on the fies but i liked them that way. Mom had a wild mushroom burger, she said it was tender she asked for rare and got blood rare ""the way she likes it"". she didn't like her french fries, had potential with seasoning, but where twice cooked which made them rubbery. After dinner my family and i decided to have desert which i extremely recommend, dad had the red velvet cheesecake, he says it was very good. (not very talkative tonight) Lol. Mom had the Raspberry Lemon Cheesecake she said the sauce topping was way too tart so she pushed it off to the side, commented that the whipped cream on the side was nice and tasty, also said the amount was just right. Both my parents had coffee's which had been freshly brewed, mom said it was above average coffee, i observed that it was quite hot, needed 3 sugars and plenty of cream, depending on who was drinking it. I had a cappucino which was, fair warning- huge, alot larger than your average cap. So i had the adams penut butter fudge ripple cheesecake, which was, O.M.G.

426,Jessica M.,"Hollister, CA",4,4,1.0,4.0,2012-07-23,"My family and i went to the cheesecake factory today for dinner and indulged ourselves quite a bit. but fist, let me go over the service. We where seated quickly (but it was an odd hous 4:30ish), our waitress was amazing, she went over what the specials/soups of the day where before we had to ask and wasn't fake at all and was extremely plesant. As for the food, we where brought bread to munch on, a small white french loaf and a small brown bread loaf with oats on the top, and they also brought butter pats.The menu was huge and they have a vey nice bar with plenty to choose from, they also have a new skinylicious menu for the ones watching their weight. We ordered the fried macaroni and cheese (extremely fatty and caloric i know but as i said, we indulged ourselves tonight), and it was amazing. The noodles where well cooked and not soggy or dry from being fried, the sauce was very flavorfull, and the breading kept everything together well. They put a cream marinara on the bottom of the plate for dipping and my family and i agreed that it was perfect with the macaroni balls, (did i say they where formed in four golf ball-sized portions on the plate? no? well now i did.) My dad ordered the fetutini alfredo with a side of sauteed spinach and the spinach was cooked only with a little butter, salt, and pepper in a cast iron pan. my dad said the pasta was well cooked in the alfredo, the sauce wasn't too thick or to runny and he said it stuck well to the pasta. I had a chipotle crispy chicken sandwich on a kaiser roll. the only thing chipotle about it was a mayo sauce.I agreed with my mom's following notes on the fies but i liked them that way. Mom had a wild mushroom burger, she said it was tender she asked for rare and got blood rare ""the way she likes it"". she didn't like her french fries, had potential with seasoning, but where twice cooked which made them rubbery. After dinner my family and i decided to have desert which i extremely recommend, dad had the red velvet cheesecake, he says it was very good. (not very talkative tonight) Lol. Mom had the Raspberry Lemon Cheesecake she said the sauce topping was way too tart so she pushed it off to the side, commented that the whipped cream on the side was nice and tasty, also said the amount was just right. Both my parents had coffee's which had been freshly brewed, mom said it was above average coffee, i observed that it was quite hot, needed 3 sugars and plenty of cream, depending on who was drinking it. I had a cappucino which was, fair warning- huge, alot larger than your average cap. So i had the adams penut butter fudge ripple cheesecake, which was, O.M.G.

The ambiance is nice, the service is nice, the seating options are nice (inside or outside- outside tables even have heaters!), and the wait is very moderate.  Only like 15 minutes and with the mall being right there, it was not a problem. I've had never really ""dined"" here in the sense that all I ever sat down and ate prior to Tuesday was the Cheesecake.  But on Tuesday, with Cheesecakes being half off and I having over $70 in gift cards, decided to sit down and experience the entire dinner.  And it was great.  The menu is huuuuge.  For the appetizer, I went with the fried avocado rolls, apparently one of their specialties, and it was awesome.  Very expensive, but truly something I'd never eaten before.  Tasted like a Chinese spring roll biting in but then immediately changed flavor to a more American taste.  For dinner, they have so many options that it's hard to decide what to get.  I was going to order from the Skinnylicious menu before I realized it's really the exact same thing as the normal menu except served in smaller portions, and hence cheaper.  So I ordered the normal veggie burger from the ""unhealthy menu"", probably having at least 800 calories, and it was delicious.  I also had some of the cheese pizza, which was excellent.   The desserts...  Before I even came, I knew was going to go with the cheesecake, but couldn't decide which one.  They are all extremely unhealthy, with some cakes having up to 1300-1500 calories in just one slice.  I didn't let that bother me and ultimately, I ordered the Godiva Cheesecake and split it.  It was a good thing I split it, because that thing was huge!  No one should be able to eat the entire thing after dinner and I'm not surprised it has that many calories.  For a four person family, you really only need two slices.  I also had some of the Tiramisu cheesecake, which was good, but nothing in comparison to the layered Godvida cake which was bursting with flavor.  I don't even remember what the layers were, but I remember it having a bottom brownie crust, a second layer consisting of cheesecake, actual Godiva chocolate in there somewhere, and topped with a bunch of whipped cream.   So yeah, excellent place.  And bill only came out to be $44 with tip for four people.  Pretty cheap considering we had no coupons.  Oh yeah, checked my weight the next day- not a single pound gained (hehe).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=360,2.96,3.77,3.77,3.0280000000000005,3.446

Total sweetness overload!  The food is...meh. I mean, it's not horrible by any means, and it is better than a million other joints, but the prices are steep, portions WAAAAAY toooo big, and the food is nothing to rave about. I would rather pay a smaller fee and get a much smaller portion and would likely dine here more if there was more selection in the smaller portion sizes. Put all that together and factor in the long wait to get a table on most days and times, and then factor in that you have a server who is mega busy waiting on table and likely to be less attentive than servers at less crowded establishments and it just doesn't make much sense to me why this place is so popular.

Chicken and cheese stuffed inside some delicious breading and deep-fried, with spicy buffalo sauce and/or blue cheese dressing to dip them in. The sauce was flavorful and not overwhelming, although I can always handle (and enjoy) the heat. Delicious.

While we were having our pre-dinner bread, we noticed that my spoon had food crusted on it, as did one of the plates. When presented to the waiter, his attitude was uncaring and he seemed annoyed by our concern.  The menu, while expansive is very random and the food choices are not paired well. For example, several dishes included a starch but not a vegetable. When we asked if my salmon came with a vegetable, the waiter simply said ""no"" and did not even offer any suggestions. Spaghetti did not include a salad, and once again no input from the waiter other than ""no"". The waiter told us that the items on the ""regular"" menu came in gigantic portions. However, the only things that were large were the plates and cheap starches such as potatoes and noodles. The meat and veggies were very very small portions.  Food was OK, but obviously prepackaged and reheated. Service was average at best, but we were forced into paying a 18% gratuity.

When visiting from out of town, they'll make the Cheesecake Factory a destination, right alongside the outlet stores (which don't suck, really, I'm just saying it's a package deal). I used to not be a jerk and just go, just to spend time with my people, but I cannot do it anymore. I had to break it to them.   There are so sososo many good places to eat in Portland. SO MANY. The Cheesecake Factory is not one of them. The meat products have the texture of soggy sawdust mixed with wax. The cheesecake weirdly has the same texture. Everything comes with an extra helping of clogged arteries with none of the pesky flavor that gets in the way of a really unsatisfying meal.  It's not exactly false advertising. The cheesecake really does taste like it was made in a factory. Maybe a Jell-O factory. Maybe Dr. Scholl's. It's not the fault of the people who work here, either. I recognize that. Also, the space is huge and built for big gatherings and family-friendly, etc. Bully.  Were there not so many 5-star reviews of this place, I might be more inclined to give it a two just for kitsch.

It was a Monday so we were sat right away. Just like every other Cheesecake Factory, the interior is dark and romantic.  Perhaps a little too dark.  Thankfully the servers are flying about in all white, which makes them easy to see. LOL. Had a really great margarita.  Later had a yummy Lemon Drop. The menu is way tooo diverse and intimidating to navigate.  Over the last few years they tend  to change it frequently.  So, I tend to just ask the server to find the page of the type of food I feel like having.  It was salad night for me.  This salad was the BEST I have ever ordered at any restaurant, EVER.  The LUAU Salad.  I love it when the lettuce isn't the main ingredient, but merely part of the whole!  This salad was loaded with tons of veggies, chicken, and mango.  Stacked on top are two GIANT wontons that cover the whole top.  The salad was way too big for me. ( I don't mind) This meant I had the rest for breakfast.  Pretty good as leftovers!!!!!!! The only thing I would recommend is that the servers not bring out bread that appears to have been SAT on!!!!! Not very pretty!!!!

We had a wonderful appetizer, drinks, and them meal, and of course couldn't leave without delicious cheesecake and homemade whipped cream!

The menu is fantastic because there are so many different things to order, but at the same time, it takes forever to look at everything.  They serve breakfast all day, there's appetizers, salads, sandwiches, burgers, simple dishes, fancier and more expensive dishes, a whole menu of ""skinnylicious"" items which are designed to be low-calorie, two full pages of desserts and on and on.  After taking probably 15 minutes to look over everything, I decided on a veggie burger and salad. My server brought two small loaves of bread (one wheat, one white) with really good real butter, and dinner came out shortly.  My veggie burger was AMAZING.  When you order veggie burgers at restaurants, most of the time they are handmade.  Some places use veggies and grains, others use black beans, every place kinda does their own thing.  Cheesecake Factory makes theirs with black beans, brown rice, farro grain, beets and onions.  It was so flavorful and unique and just simply amazing.   I also wanted to try some cheesecake because they're famous for it, so I decided on the original plain flavor.  I was actually really disappointed with my cheesecake selection.  The cheesecake is made with a lot of sour cream, and it definitely has that tangy flavor to it.  Also, it was really soft in the middle, almost running off my fork.  Maybe I'm just used to eating a more firm cheesecake, but regardless, I wasn't a big fan.  However, I don't think it would deter me from eating there or trying another dessert.  It could have just been a fluke.

How large does it need to be? And many different cuisines?  What type of restaurant is this?  Italian? Burger joint?  Chinese?  Seafood?  Pizzeria? Pick a specialty and go with it. I'd can only imagine how they kitchen staff can prep for a service. With the menu so scattered, a feel like the quality goes down. Second gripe: lighting. I feel like I had to strain to see the person in front of me.  It was also kind of jarring to transition between the mall lighting and the restaurant lighting.  Last gripe:  the wait. Nearly an hour.

We arrived at dinner rush so I expected there to be a wait but not a 90 minute wait. Oh well not a huge deal as it is attached to the mall so we walked around while we waited for time to pass. When we were seated they brought our two year old a complimentary plate with bananas and bread on it. I wish more placed did this! Our waiter then came took our drink order, he returned right away with water and a coke but forgot my strawberry lemon-aid and then disappeared for 10 minutes still not bringing it when he came back.  He did eventually bring it but it took much longer than it ever should have even with them being busy.  We ordered tomato-basil pizza, shrimp scampi (served with angle hair pasta), and a side of french fries to share.  The portion of the fries was huge! Three to four people could definitely split this and not feel like they got cheated out of fries.  The kitchen messed up the pizza and they brought out a tomato-basil flat breas by mistake and just comped us that. This was good, the bread was thin and crisp the edges were not burnt nor were any of the toppings. It was light but better as a shared appetizer than a meal. The shrimp scampi was not 100% what I was expecting but it was good. The shrimp was large and was breaded and sautéed, no sauce on it. The pasta had a light garlic cream sauce which was very tasty but more sauce was definitely needed. Finally the pizza was brought out. I had them take it back and boxes up to take home so I cannot comment on it. Lastly we decided to order a dessert.

So we have the dog running around, we have the sun in our eyes, but the waiter came quick and we thought okay we're hungry!  But this should have been a sign! I was happy that I could get my standard race meal, Penne Pasta, Grilled Chicken, and Marinara, almost exact, I just had to order it without the basil butter and oil.  The waiter confirmed my order, I was happy.  The order came out wrong.  First, I hate sending food back; ever since the movies ""waiting"" and ""still waiting"" came out it scares me enough to eat out and then to send it back?!?  Well it had to go, and so I sat, and my food came, and this time it came out right. (?)  Secondly, the waiter that was waiting on us we had to ask him to speak up 4 times.....I'm not hard of hearing and it wasn't loud; we were sitting on the patio.  It just felt like he was doing it to be annoying.

On the positive: the service is very good. The few times I've been there. The servers have been prompt, attentive, knowledgable of the massive menu, and courteous.

How large does it need to be? And many different cuisines?  What type of restaurant is this?  Italian? Burger joint?  Chinese?  Seafood?  Pizzeria? Pick a specialty and go with it. I'd can only imagine how they kitchen staff can prep for a service. With the menu so scattered, a feel like the quality goes down. Second gripe: lighting. I feel like I had to strain to see the person in front of me.  It was also kind of jarring to transition between the mall lighting and the restaurant lighting.  Last gripe:  the wait. Nearly an hour. It seemed a little excessive since the service and food were quick (one of the big pluses): the wait was probably due to people having too many choices on the menu.

I've been to this Cheesecake factory location a few times, and have been underwhelmed each time.  But my visit last night takes the cake, no pun intended.   Before I get to last night, I've been to quite a number of Cheesecake factory locations and this one by far is the worst I've been to.  For starters, they seem to have somehow packed in way more seats than they should have - you're literally bumping elbows with the people sitting next to you.  Not pleasant.  Next, in my opinion, the food at this location is not as good as the other CF's I've visited.  So last night, I happen to be close to this location and for some reason decide to stop here for a meal.  I go up to the reception area, told that it's a 10-15 minute wait, say that's fine, handed a pager, and I have a seat and wait.  Pager goes off, ushered over to my table (which is about the right size for an elf) yet the table hasn't even been cleaned yet.  So I patiently wait until it's cleaned and sit down.  No menu, so as soon as my server comes over, I kindly ask for a menu.  She then has the audacity to ask me where I came from and did I come from up-front - clearly implying by her words and tone that I had somehow cut in front of everyone else waiting and just plopped down at this table. I'm thinking really? did this person really just ask me that question? Given the elbow to elbow seating, I waited for the people sitting next to me to leave before I spoke to my server - as I didn't want to embarrass her in front of those people.  Yeah, I had a little more respect for her then she had for me. So the people next to me leave, and I tell her how inappropriate it was to tell a customer that, clearly implying they're some dishonest schmuck who can't wait in a line.  She goes on to say something along the lines of ""well we have a problem with that"" - people just sitting down apparently.  And how that's my problem, I've yet to understand.  Total lack of accountability and I think my telling her this sailed right over her head.  If this location has a problem with people sitting down at tables, perhaps they should look into fixing their seating issues, but treating customers like criminals is totally inexcusable.  Needless to say I won't be going back to this establishment again.  Even despite this unfortunate event, this particular Cheesecake factory isn't worth waiting in line 30 seconds for.   PS: The manager, at least it seemed to be the manager, was going from table to table like some Disneyland automaton asking each person the exact same canned question if they were enjoying their ""experience"" or something along those lines - with as much genuine interest as some Washington DC politician.  He didn't even seem to pause long enough to hear someone's answer :) Priceless.

So last night, I happen to be close to this location and for some reason decide to stop here for a meal.  I go up to the reception area, told that it's a 10-15 minute wait, say that's fine, handed a pager, and I have a seat and wait.  Pager goes off, ushered over to my table (which is about the right size for an elf) yet the table hasn't even been cleaned yet.  So I patiently wait until it's cleaned and sit down.  No menu, so as soon as my server comes over, I kindly ask for a menu.  She then has the audacity to ask me where I came from and did I come from up-front - clearly implying by her words and tone that I had somehow cut in front of everyone else waiting and just plopped down at this table. I'm thinking really? did this person really just ask me that question? Given the elbow to elbow seating, I waited for the people sitting next to me to leave before I spoke to my server - as I didn't want to embarrass her in front of those people.  Yeah, I had a little more respect for her then she had for me. So the people next to me leave, and I tell her how inappropriate it was to tell a customer that, clearly implying they're some dishonest schmuck who can't wait in a line.  She goes on to say something along the lines of ""well we have a problem with that"" - people just sitting down apparently.  And how that's my problem, I've yet to understand.  Total lack of accountability and I think my telling her this sailed right over her head.  If this location has a problem with people sitting down at tables, perhaps they should look into fixing their seating issues, but treating customers like criminals is totally inexcusable.  Needless to say I won't be going back to this establishment again.  Even despite this unfortunate event, this particular Cheesecake factory isn't worth waiting in line 30 seconds for.   PS: The manager, at least it seemed to be the manager, was going from table to table like some Disneyland automaton asking each person the exact same canned question if they were enjoying their ""experience"" or something along those lines - with as much genuine interest as some Washington DC politician.  He didn't even seem to pause long enough to hear someone's answer :) Priceless. No wonder this place is running like it is.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=220,2.84,2.91,3.468,2.8520000000000003,2.8819999999999997

243,Elizabeth L.,"Clackamas, OR",38,71,194.0,4.0,2013-12-07,"We tried The Cheesecake Factor for the first time this evening.  We arrived at dinner rush so I expected there to be a wait but not a 90 minute wait. Oh well not a huge deal as it is attached to the mall so we walked around while we waited for time to pass. When we were seated they brought our two year old a complimentary plate with bananas and bread on it. I wish more placed did this! Our waiter then came took our drink order, he returned right away with water and a coke but forgot my strawberry lemon-aid and then disappeared for 10 minutes still not bringing it when he came back.  He did eventually bring it but it took much longer than it ever should have even with them being busy.  We ordered tomato-basil pizza, shrimp scampi (served with angle hair pasta), and a side of french fries to share.  The portion of the fries was huge! Three to four people could definitely split this and not feel like they got cheated out of fries.  The kitchen messed up the pizza and they brought out a tomato-basil flat breas by mistake and just comped us that. This was good, the bread was thin and crisp the edges were not burnt nor were any of the toppings. It was light but better as a shared appetizer than a meal. The shrimp scampi was not 100% what I was expecting but it was good. The shrimp was large and was breaded and sautéed, no sauce on it. The pasta had a light garlic cream sauce which was very tasty but more sauce was definitely needed. Finally the pizza was brought out. I had them take it back and boxes up to take home so I cannot comment on it. Lastly we decided to order a dessert. We chose the Linda (?) cake it was very chocolaty and very rich between the two of us we did not finish half of it, but it was so good.

The steak and the shrimp however were amazing. The steak I had medium rare and it was amazing, great seasoning, perfectly balanced, and properly cooked. Then the sauce just pushed it over the edge and made it divine, I wish I had more of it. Then the scampi was also pretty amazing. The sauce it came with however was a little too overpowering, but when lightly applied to the shrimp it provided a good balance of flavor, I also wish I had more shrimp to eat, but between the two the steak would be the definite winner. If you want just the steak it was called Diane's steak. I also don't feel like they gave enough food for the money I paid but company meal, so I can't complain too much.

The steak and the shrimp however were amazing. The steak I had medium rare and it was amazing, great seasoning, perfectly balanced, and properly cooked. Then the sauce just pushed it over the edge and made it divine, I wish I had more of it. Then the scampi was also pretty amazing. The sauce it came with however was a little too overpowering, but when lightly applied to the shrimp it provided a good balance of flavor, I also wish I had more shrimp to eat, but between the two the steak would be the definite winner. If you want just the steak it was called Diane's steak. I also don't feel like they gave enough food for the money I paid but company meal, so I can't complain too much. Ambience was good, service was good, only down side was the last persons dish didn't come out till about 15 minutes later. They did end up giving the meal for free though along with a free soup or salad, would have been nice if they gave a free cheesecake slice though. Otherwise it was a great experience.

It had just opened in our former city and everyone was still in love. We left unimpressed and not in any sort of hurry to visit another location again.  Fast forward a few years and now my husband won a gift card from work. We'd had it for a while and found ourselves with some unexpected free time, no dinner plans, and near this place. So, pretty much the perfect storm for dining here.  Oddly enough the wait wasn't that long. We were quoted 15 minutes, but didn't wait that long. Our server was lovely and nice. I just can not get over those menus, you know. I'm a fan of a one page menu and these give me some sort of anxiety. I even dissect the organization of sections. The novel-like menu turns me off like you wouldn't even believe. I seriously lose my appetite.  The food was ""eh"". It was really good, it wasn't the worst. It just tasted like any other chain that doesn't really stand out. I couldn't even remember what I had until I really thought about it. I had some sort of burger, my daughter had some type of pasta and I can't remember what my son and husband had. The kids had to have one of the cheesecake slices after the meal.

The novel-like menu turns me off like you wouldn't even believe. I seriously lose my appetite.  The food was ""eh"". It was really good, it wasn't the worst. It just tasted like any other chain that doesn't really stand out. I couldn't even remember what I had until I really thought about it.

Even though we were seated and ordered first, they both received each course long before we did. We had the same server as one side and a different server than the other side.  I'm not sure what would have caused the delay, it was just strange sitting there so long after two sets of customers came and went while we were still waiting for our food. The food was very good though, as always. Service was friendly too. I'd forgotten that they box up the leftovers for you, they don't just bring you the box. The box and bag both leaked horribly though, even though I was VERY careful to keep it perfectly level. So the leftovers had to go straight to the trash.

Fortunately they did replace them.  My mom then proceeded to go to the bathroom and there were no toilet covers and she could see straight through to the next stall and could see everything going on in that stall. She returned highly upset. She talked to the manager who was highly condescending and insincere but said he would have the seat covers replaced right away. 20 minuets later after my sisters and i had to go to the restroom and my mother came with us. The bathroom was gross. There was toilet paper on the floor one of the toilets wouldn't flush and not only was there still no toilet seat covers and the hole still there but also the doors locking the toilet paper and seat covers was unlocked and kept hitting me as I tried to use the restroom. My mom was furious this time as the ever so great manager had done nothing to make the women of the restaurant feel comfortable instead of getting the opportunity to be stared at as we pee.

Our pasta was cold-which was weird cause the plates were hot and the food came out quick- and the chicken was dry. The waitress was nice enough to get us new ones with even less than what we got before. The chicken was not worth the extra $3 we paid for. We all ordered cheesecake too. They were delicious (as always) except they said they were out of meringue for the topping on the lemon meringue, but didn't want to replace it.  This was a mother's outing for us, but my mother had the worst experience. She went to go to the bathroom and the stalls were all out of toilet seat covers. Because they were out of toilet seat covers you could see into the other stall! My mother came back surprised that there would not be solid panels in between each bathroom stall. When the waitress came back around she had the manager called over and when she explained the situation he just looked and said I'm sorry and walked away like it was no problem. We all had to go to the restroom while we waited for the check so four of us girls went so we could go in pairs so that we did not have anyone peeking through the hole in the panel at us. We went and all saw the hole for ourselves. There were still no toilet seat covers in either stall (this was 20 minutes after we had complained to the manager). So we once again informed the manager and a female employee that there was no toilet seat covers and that there was a hole in the wall. We insisted that the manager fix Tue problem and we would wait for him to finish before we went to the bathroom. He rolled his eyes and sighed at us, before going to fix the problem. This is a problem that needs to be fixed immediately with patching up the panel somehow. The manager was rude and didn't seem to care about any of our problems.

The meal was bad from beginning to end and now I feel horribly sick. Not food poisoning sick, just sick from all the many many very bad quality ingredients that they use in their food. First of all, we started the meal with a margarita and a mai tai. The margarita was more like a waterita and the mai tai was one of the scariest cocktails I have ever tasted in my life. It tasted exactly like the syrup that maraschino cherries sit inside of. I could not drink it at all. Next, we asked the waiter for some glasses of water. Instead of bringing us both water, he only brings water for one person. One of the next times he came around I asked him to please bring another water. Instead of bringing another water, he quickly grabbed the 1 cup of water that was already there and refilled it and came back. Wow. Next, we had some guacamole which was actually not that bad aside from the salsa that accompanied it which was basically just diced tomatoes out of a can. After that, I ordered a margherita pizza. The pizza was one of the scariest parts of all. It was literally just pizza crust with a smear of sauce and some tiny scattered slices of mozzarella. All the places that did not have mozzarella we're literally just crust. Also, I just remembered I forgot to mention the chicken samosas. This was also one of the scariest parts of the meal by far. Usually samosas are made with a delicious combination of curried vegetables. The outside of the samosas were exactly like egg rolls and the inside was just ground chicken, that's it.  I instantly felt sick.

This restaurant has always had a special place in our hearts. As time has passed, the euphoria of that experience has worn off, and we are able to see the cheesecake factory for what it is; a fairly good chain restaurant with a menu clearly designed to satisfy the masses. The food, atmosphere, and service are good but not great. Nothing about the experience is exemplary or unique, but sometimes a good lunch that is certain to not disappoint is exactly what we want. The wait times vary from 15 minutes to an hour, and the food can be pricey. The restaurant is very popular so they obviously do enough right to make anyone happy.

But once seated we seemed to be forgotten.  There were two of us, and also parties of two on either side of us. Even though we were seated and ordered first, they both received each course long before we did. We had the same server as one side and a different server than the other side.  I'm not sure what would have caused the delay, it was just strange sitting there so long after two sets of customers came and went while we were still waiting for our food. The food was very good though, as always. Service was friendly too. I'd forgotten that they box up the leftovers for you, they don't just bring you the box. The box and bag both leaked horribly though, even though I was VERY careful to keep it perfectly level. So the leftovers had to go straight to the trash. Had I boxed them up myself, I'd have left out the sauces, especially the one I clearly hadn't touched (why would I want to take that one home if I didn't care to eat any of it there?)

556,Jane V.,"Newberg, United States",43,197,362.0,3.0,2015-08-12,"Before we walked in we saw customers with the digital callers waiting for a table. Not a good sign. Walked through the restaurant door and 30 plus customers sitting, standing, and waiting to get signed up for a table. We headed straight to the bar hoping for a shorter wait.  The bar area is quite large with many tables and a long bar that must seat 20. Everything was full  except two chairs on the end of the bar. It was being cleaned off and we did not see anyone waiting. Lucky us. We snatched it up.  The bartender greeted us right away and asked if we are having cocktails and/or food. We took our time to order food since the menu is quite extensive. It was very difficult to read the menu due to the very dim lighting. We really like the atmosphere. The lighting made it quite intimate  even though the restaurant was packed. I guess this is when one can use their phone for additional lighting in reading the menu. I know my dad would not have been able to read it even with glasses. We ordered the bar size Asian salad and the Cuban sandwich with sweet potato fries. My daughter and I share everything. Even with the smaller salad we could not finish it all. We thought the salad had a good combination of chicken and vegetables with some mandarin oranges and dressing. The Cuban sandwich  was on a baguette with a assortment of meats and a few pickles. Very simple, very filling, very large. The sandwich was brought to us with a side salad not the sweet potato fries as we ordered. I was surprised that the server took the salad of the plate in exchange for the fries. Not that we would have room to eat it anyway but most places just leave it and also bring the correct item. We waited for a good 10 minute for the fries. Got charged for them too. 10 minutes was a long time. We did not have dessert which I am sure going to The Cheesecake Factory and not having cheesecake is a crime. Maybe next time if we have a lighter lunch.

Our pasta was cold-which was weird cause the plates were hot and the food came out quick- and the chicken was dry. The waitress was nice enough to get us new ones with even less than what we got before. The chicken was not worth the extra $3 we paid for. We all ordered cheesecake too. They were delicious (as always) except they said they were out of meringue for the topping on the lemon meringue, but didn't want to replace it.  This was a mother's outing for us, but my mother had the worst experience. She went to go to the bathroom and the stalls were all out of toilet seat covers. Because they were out of toilet seat covers you could see into the other stall! My mother came back surprised that there would not be solid panels in between each bathroom stall. When the waitress came back around she had the manager called over and when she explained the situation he just looked and said I'm sorry and walked away like it was no problem. We all had to go to the restroom while we waited for the check so four of us girls went so we could go in pairs so that we did not have anyone peeking through the hole in the panel at us. We went and all saw the hole for ourselves. There were still no toilet seat covers in either stall (this was 20 minutes after we had complained to the manager). So we once again informed the manager and a female employee that there was no toilet seat covers and that there was a hole in the wall. We insisted that the manager fix Tue problem and we would wait for him to finish before we went to the bathroom. He rolled his eyes and sighed at us, before going to fix the problem. This is a problem that needs to be fixed immediately with patching up the panel somehow. The manager was rude and didn't seem to care about any of our problems. The waitresses cheerful attitude was the only thing that went good during this experience.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=180,3.44,3.32,3.264,2.5960000000000005,3.3680000000000003

Fortunately they did replace them.  My mom then proceeded to go to the bathroom and there were no toilet covers and she could see straight through to the next stall and could see everything going on in that stall. She returned highly upset. She talked to the manager who was highly condescending and insincere but said he would have the seat covers replaced right away. 20 minuets later after my sisters and i had to go to the restroom and my mother came with us. The bathroom was gross. There was toilet paper on the floor one of the toilets wouldn't flush and not only was there still no toilet seat covers and the hole still there but also the doors locking the toilet paper and seat covers was unlocked and kept hitting me as I tried to use the restroom.

The lounge is busy, it's loud, the tables are tiny, you're so close to your neighbor you might as well just share food, and almost every time I've had a bad service experience it's been in the lounge. So heed my advice, just sit in the dining room where you don't feel like a sardine in the middle of the stock exchange (seriously, where do all these food runners come from??

218,Tatiana P.,"Junction City, OR",0,13,,1.0,2015-10-06,"Wow, I just left from one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. The meal was bad from beginning to end and now I feel horribly sick. Not food poisoning sick, just sick from all the many many very bad quality ingredients that they use in their food. First of all, we started the meal with a margarita and a mai tai. The margarita was more like a waterita and the mai tai was one of the scariest cocktails I have ever tasted in my life. It tasted exactly like the syrup that maraschino cherries sit inside of. I could not drink it at all. Next, we asked the waiter for some glasses of water. Instead of bringing us both water, he only brings water for one person. One of the next times he came around I asked him to please bring another water. Instead of bringing another water, he quickly grabbed the 1 cup of water that was already there and refilled it and came back. Wow. Next, we had some guacamole which was actually not that bad aside from the salsa that accompanied it which was basically just diced tomatoes out of a can. After that, I ordered a margherita pizza. The pizza was one of the scariest parts of all. It was literally just pizza crust with a smear of sauce and some tiny scattered slices of mozzarella. All the places that did not have mozzarella we're literally just crust. Also, I just remembered I forgot to mention the chicken samosas. This was also one of the scariest parts of the meal by far. Usually samosas are made with a delicious combination of curried vegetables. The outside of the samosas were exactly like egg rolls and the inside was just ground chicken, that's it.  I instantly felt sick. What can I say, another way that a big restaurant chain in America is scamming Americans out of their money while getting rich and laughing about it. What is our country coming to? Do Americans have taste buds anymore?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=280,3.36,3.38,3.296,2.6920000000000006,3.3720000000000003

My daughter likes this place so I find myself overpaying at this establishment from time to time. The staff can vary not just by day, but by who happens to be delivering something to your table. I've had really great service and I've had incredibly bad service. It is what it is and I go here knowing what to expect, the bar isn't set high.  What I learned in my last visit is that they tend to always try to seat you in the lounge area unless you state a preference. This is a bad idea for you as a diner. The lounge is busy, it's loud, the tables are tiny, you're so close to your neighbor you might as well just share food, and almost every time I've had a bad service experience it's been in the lounge. So heed my advice, just sit in the dining room where you don't feel like a sardine in the middle of the stock exchange (seriously, where do all these food runners come from?? Where do they store them in the back?). I'm bumping them from 2-stars to 3 only because the cheesecake is so good and they have so many kinds.

Walked through the restaurant door and 30 plus customers sitting, standing, and waiting to get signed up for a table. We headed straight to the bar hoping for a shorter wait.  The bar area is quite large with many tables and a long bar that must seat 20. Everything was full  except two chairs on the end of the bar. It was being cleaned off and we did not see anyone waiting. Lucky us. We snatched it up.  The bartender greeted us right away and asked if we are having cocktails and/or food. We took our time to order food since the menu is quite extensive. It was very difficult to read the menu due to the very dim lighting. We really like the atmosphere. The lighting made it quite intimate  even though the restaurant was packed. I guess this is when one can use their phone for additional lighting in reading the menu. I know my dad would not have been able to read it even with glasses. We ordered the bar size Asian salad and the Cuban sandwich with sweet potato fries. My daughter and I share everything. Even with the smaller salad we could not finish it all. We thought the salad had a good combination of chicken and vegetables with some mandarin oranges and dressing. The Cuban sandwich  was on a baguette with a assortment of meats and a few pickles. Very simple, very filling, very large. The sandwich was brought to us with a side salad not the sweet potato fries as we ordered. I was surprised that the server took the salad of the plate in exchange for the fries. Not that we would have room to eat it anyway but most places just leave it and also bring the correct item. We waited for a good 10 minute for the fries. Got charged for them too. 10 minutes was a long time. We did not have dessert which I am sure going to The Cheesecake Factory and not having cheesecake is a crime.

The decor, the overwhelming business and sound, the twenty+ page menu, it's all very...dependable.  I'd been to this location in the past and the food wasn't all that great - it was very clearly frozen. They seemed to have improved, though, as my visit tonight was very enjoyable!  My guy and I, on a date night using a gift card we received for Christmas, had the avocado eggrolls, a veggie burger with fries, and the falafel salad. All VERY good. I would highly recommend the cucumber lemonade!  Our waitress was friendly and efficient, keeping us moving through the dining experience quickly but not rudely. We were lucky enough to be seated in a dark corner for our date-night, which really added to the enjoyment. Social anxiety + those awkward tables that are too close together along a long booth DO NOT MIX.

I've been at least 4 times and ordered the same thing, the macaroni and cheese burger sub a veggie patty. The server said that she could do that, but that the macaroni and cheese balls contain meat broth as well as the cheese sauce that they put on it, so I may not want to eat it if I was a vegetarian. I am a vegetarian and I was incredibly upset that I hadn't been told the previous 4 times I had ordered this same meal. If you add meat to something that is generally meat-free, it should be noted on the menu and your staff should make it known to people who are specifically ordering their meals to be vegetarian. My boyfriend and I ordered an appetizer while I looked for something else, but I wasn't really in the mood to eat there after that. I started looking at the desserts so we could get something to go. Our waitress noticed and informed me that the cheesecakes are made with animal based gelatin, which is completely unnecessary. Not only is there plant-based gelatin, but as a baker, I have made cheesecakes that didn't require gelatin and were the same rich consistency.

I had to wait in line and when it was my turn, Lucas knew exactly who I was and told me the 6 inch strawberry cheesecake was no longer available. There were a few 6 inch plain and one strawberry in the front case. I asked if I can get one of those. He told me they are not for sale, although I saw someone pull some from the front case. I asked him what is the smallest cake he had and he told me a 10 inch one for double the price. Since it was my daughter's birthday and she specifically asked for it, I went ahead and bought it. Lucas told me they were ready made. I was very surprised to see him go in the back area and put strawberries on a plain cheesecake, then charge the higher price.  I had to wait over half an hour for Lucas to make the strawberry cheesecake. He did not apologize for the wait or say thank you. Will never go back nor recommend this place to anyone.

Yes, imagine your child crying and in pain for six weeks for one bite of the wrong stuff -- this is our life.  My wife took our daughter out for a special mother-daughter shopping night at the mall, and they decided to try to eat at Cheesecake Factory,  My wife came home praising her experience!  Two managers, Daniel and Cathy (sp?), sat in the booth discussing the menu and my daughter's allergies, to insure she would get a safe meal.  The chef apparently did their best to use separate equipment etc.  The waitress was extremely understanding and communicative.  My wife could not be more impressed. We used to love this place just for their happy hour and the experience my wife and I would have on our own, now we're just amazed at how supportive and caring the restaurant staff is. P.S. my food and service has always been good here -- obviously you're not getting fine dining, but very good food and prices and selection. I personally love the hot dog happy hour option, served on mini wood cutting board.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=120,3.4,3.12,3.236,2.9000000000000004,3.2320000000000007

I'd been to this location in the past and the food wasn't all that great - it was very clearly frozen. They seemed to have improved, though, as my visit tonight was very enjoyable!

I would highly recommend the cucumber lemonade!  Our waitress was friendly and efficient, keeping us moving through the dining experience quickly but not rudely. We were lucky enough to be seated in a dark corner for our date-night, which really added to the enjoyment.

It makes for a excellent pit stop to refuel and recharge before tackling the remaining acreage of the stores.  THE PARKING Endless and ample free lot parking surrounding the entire shopping center.  THE ATMOSPHERE The last time my husband and I visited a Cheesecake Factory was many many years ago. It was the one in Waikiki where it's always crowded, dimly lit and so noisy that you can't even hear yourself think. This location in Tigard was a pleasant surprise. As soon as you enter the restaurant, there's enough space in there to ballroom dance. The charming decor, elegant lighting, soothing color tones, exaggerated high ceilings and well-spaced tables make for a comfortable yet grand feel.  THE FOOD Even though it's typical Cheesecake Factory fare, it's consistent and done really well.  ---Teriyaki Chicken $16.95--- Sure it's not the best teriyaki chicken, but it's a good healthy alternative though it contains way too much sodium for someone on a low sodium diet. As usual, the portion size is generous. However, my husband didn't have any trouble polishing off the chicken and mashed potatoes plus 1/4 of my salad. He left the accompanying sautéed plantains untouched. I ate the sautéed pineapple chunks which came with his dish.  ---Sheila's Chicken & Avocado Salad, dinner size $14.95--- I love salads and this one certainly satisfies without high calorie ingredients like bleu cheese and bacon. It contained a generous mix of romaine lettuce, mixed greens, cubed avocado, a sprinkling of cashew nuts and some sliced chicken breast. The honey peanut dressing was requested on the side which was flavorful but turned out to be slightly too sweet for my taste.   THE SERVICE  Extremely professional, courteous, attentive and prompt.

As soon as you enter the restaurant, there's enough space in there to ballroom dance. The charming decor, elegant lighting, soothing color tones, exaggerated high ceilings and well-spaced tables make for a comfortable yet grand feel.  THE FOOD Even though it's typical Cheesecake Factory fare, it's consistent and done really well.  ---Teriyaki Chicken $16.95--- Sure it's not the best teriyaki chicken, but it's a good healthy alternative though it contains way too much sodium for someone on a low sodium diet. As usual, the portion size is generous. However, my husband didn't have any trouble polishing off the chicken and mashed potatoes plus 1/4 of my salad. He left the accompanying sautéed plantains untouched. I ate the sautéed pineapple chunks which came with his dish.  ---Sheila's Chicken & Avocado Salad, dinner size $14.95--- I love salads and this one certainly satisfies without high calorie ingredients like bleu cheese and bacon. It contained a generous mix of romaine lettuce, mixed greens, cubed avocado, a sprinkling of cashew nuts and some sliced chicken breast. The honey peanut dressing was requested on the side which was flavorful but turned out to be slightly too sweet for my taste.   THE SERVICE  Extremely professional, courteous, attentive and prompt.  THE BOTTOMLINE We would definitely return to this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=20,2.52,3.01,3.172,2.612,2.8139999999999996

I wish the location was larger and there were more seats because my complaints are that the wait is long to get a table and that it's too loud. It's so loud that the first time I brought a friend in, we walked in and out in under a minute. We couldn't tolerate the sheer volume. Perhaps, some soft sound dampening panels or curtains could be added? The only time it's not crazy loud is rare because the restaurant isn't full... which doesn't happen frequently.

We've gotten takeout several times and it's always a nightmare. No matter what time of day you go, there are lines spilling to the door, the wait is long, and just trying to pay and pick up your food can easily take 20 minutes.  Nonetheless, we felt adventurous and thought perhaps going on a Monday at 5PM might help our chances. Nope. We walked in and stood in line for about 5 minutes to put our names down - 40 minute wait for a table for 4. We didn't feel like going anywhere else so we stuck with it. My parents went shopping and my husband and I somehow found a spot at the bar. Super friendly and attentive bartenders, and the happy hour menu was enticing just because of the value, but we figured we would wait to have food until being seated. We were seated after about 45 minutes, and were given a nice booth.  Our server was fine, nothing special. We ordered our food and it came out fairly quickly. Everyone was satisfied with what they ordered. However, my mom ordered the Chicken and Avocado salad, and it came with no avocado. The restaurant was so dark that I used the flashlight on my phone to get lighting so we could see if we were just crazy. No avocado in a salad that has avocado in the title? We thought maybe it was just at the bottom, but no, there was none. Simple mistake. However, when we told our server he looked at us like we were from another planet. He assured us there was avocado in the salad and left. My mom took several bites and there certainly was no avocado in her salad. We got him back over and he looked at us as if we were trying to pull something on him, so he just said he would bring her a side dish of a sliced up avocado. It was a weird exchange. I also had to remind him to bring me my side of fries, twice. I usually order the chicken salad sandwich because it's just that good, but this time it was bland and missing something. It seemed a bit dry and tasteless so i was disappointed.  Overall, it was a lackluster experience. I don't expect much from chains, but everything just seemed a bit disorganized and as if they didn't really care about their guests. Oh well.

When we placed our orders and the complimentary bread came in, I expressed my joy for the wheat bread of course, and she noticed it, and got us two more orders of he complimentary bread before came out. Now for the food, I had the southern grilled chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries. The mashes avocado was so much goodness :), oh and the sweet potato fries, heaven; really well cooked and salted. I also got a strawberry smoothie which was really good and refreshing too. Come time for desserts, we mentioned it was my cousin's birthday and she was like oh nice, they do have complimentary sundaes for people celebrating their birthdays and that they would sing too. And so more servers from the restaurant came in and we all sang cheerfully for him. Such a great experience. We also got some order of cheesecake slices to, and she made sure to pick out the biggest slice for me :). Of course I got the Hershey's Chocolate Bar Cheesecake. It's usually my favorite.

The bread they bring out is good, there are an unbelievable amount of choices, and the food has never been bad (granted I'm writing this as someone who has only been to about 3 different Cheesecake Factories... and only that many times). The cheesecake is always so fresh and good! My favorite is the key lime. But the red velvet is also amazing! Food wise, I've been happy with salads, the shepherds pie, chicken parmesan, and I was super surprised at how great even their nachos were! The only downfall is that they are pretty expensive. As in $15/person, even for salads. And sometimes its crowded and you get stuck at small tables really close to other (chatty) people. But I still love going there!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=40,3.12,2.8,3.032,2.7039999999999997,2.9280000000000004

We were called to be seated after a 40 min wait which is no big deal at Cheesecake Factory but when we waited at the counter two more couples that came in after us were called to be seated while we stood and watched then they acted like we never handed in our buzzer. So strange. Anyways we are seated and our waitress says take a look at the menu and we already knew our apps and drinks so she told us to hold that thought and she had to help other tables. So drinks came 15 mins later. Just doesn't sit well with a $100 bill to be herded like cattle and slung slop. Hope they can turn the staff around because the chefs still got it there wait staff sux!,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=80,3.08,2.81,3.024,2.636,2.918

499,Andrea H.,"Beaverton, United States",60,175,28.0,2.0,2017-05-01,"After living right by this location for almost two years, we finally dined inside the actual restaurant. We've gotten takeout several times and it's always a nightmare. No matter what time of day you go, there are lines spilling to the door, the wait is long, and just trying to pay and pick up your food can easily take 20 minutes.  Nonetheless, we felt adventurous and thought perhaps going on a Monday at 5PM might help our chances. Nope. We walked in and stood in line for about 5 minutes to put our names down - 40 minute wait for a table for 4. We didn't feel like going anywhere else so we stuck with it. My parents went shopping and my husband and I somehow found a spot at the bar. Super friendly and attentive bartenders, and the happy hour menu was enticing just because of the value, but we figured we would wait to have food until being seated. We were seated after about 45 minutes, and were given a nice booth.  Our server was fine, nothing special. We ordered our food and it came out fairly quickly. Everyone was satisfied with what they ordered. However, my mom ordered the Chicken and Avocado salad, and it came with no avocado. The restaurant was so dark that I used the flashlight on my phone to get lighting so we could see if we were just crazy. No avocado in a salad that has avocado in the title? We thought maybe it was just at the bottom, but no, there was none. Simple mistake. However, when we told our server he looked at us like we were from another planet. He assured us there was avocado in the salad and left. My mom took several bites and there certainly was no avocado in her salad. We got him back over and he looked at us as if we were trying to pull something on him, so he just said he would bring her a side dish of a sliced up avocado. It was a weird exchange. I also had to remind him to bring me my side of fries, twice. I usually order the chicken salad sandwich because it's just that good, but this time it was bland and missing something. It seemed a bit dry and tasteless so i was disappointed.  Overall, it was a lackluster experience. I don't expect much from chains, but everything just seemed a bit disorganized and as if they didn't really care about their guests. Oh well. Perhaps we'll stick with the bar next time since they were the friendliest and most attentive?",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=80,3.0,2.76,2.988,2.8240000000000003,2.8560000000000003

This is a place to experience with others, or be a fan of doggie bags.   Almost everything is better than average.  Today our party of 13 enjoyed a plethora of dishes.  Standouts: spaghetti and meatballs (simple, but effective), Avocado Toast, Huevos Rancheros (wish they offer refried rather than black beans), calamari, carrot cake, one of the cheesecakes (only 50 to choose so just guess), and fish tacos.   Average: cheese burger, fries, bread basket, Mac n Cheese, shrimp pasta and crab dip.  The Sangria was good, but very ice heavy.  Server did a great job, especially as we had seven kids in tow.  Food arrived fast.  It's a chain, it's in a mall, but the old formula still works.

She hooked us up pretty well, was very welcoming and happily smiling and full of excitement. We came in for lunch, to celebrate my cousin's birthday. I was feeling a bit down/tired when we got in, but she lightened up the mood with her smiles and happy comments. When we placed our orders and the complimentary bread came in, I expressed my joy for the wheat bread of course, and she noticed it, and got us two more orders of he complimentary bread before came out. Now for the food, I had the southern grilled chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries. The mashes avocado was so much goodness :), oh and the sweet potato fries, heaven; really well cooked and salted. I also got a strawberry smoothie which was really good and refreshing too. Come time for desserts, we mentioned it was my cousin's birthday and she was like oh nice, they do have complimentary sundaes for people celebrating their birthdays and that they would sing too. And so more servers from the restaurant came in and we all sang cheerfully for him. Such a great experience. We also got some order of cheesecake slices to, and she made sure to pick out the biggest slice for me :). Of course I got the Hershey's Chocolate Bar Cheesecake. It's usually my favorite. Great great experiences at this Cheesecake Factory in Hillsboro. I highly recommend. Ask for Krista too :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=40,3.4,3.05,3.024,2.868,3.19

Depending if the mall is close or not, my family just buys time by shopping around the mall till the buzzer, buzzes us up. Service quality is quite nice but sometimes we would get a server who's not really on task. A man once forgot to give us our bread till our main course came out but he was giving other people their breads and helping them but did not bother to check on us and when we asked him to, to-go our cheesecakes he said he already told the front desk to have them in their boxes, but then they ended up bringing the cheesecakes in their plates and not in boxes.  But besides that one server who wasn't so great towards me and my family, the others who served us were great and nice.

817,Mina A.,"Portland, United States",0,3,,3.0,2017-08-30,"Cheesecake Factory is one of our favorite restaurants between me, my sister, and my mom. The three of us would travel down from Portland OR to Washington Square just to eat at Cheesecake Factory. However the downfall to this is that me and my family tend to visit during their busy hours ( past 7-8 pm on weekends ) which usually have us waiting between 40 minutes or an hour just to get our table for 3 people. Depending if the mall is close or not, my family just buys time by shopping around the mall till the buzzer, buzzes us up. Service quality is quite nice but sometimes we would get a server who's not really on task. A man once forgot to give us our bread till our main course came out but he was giving other people their breads and helping them but did not bother to check on us and when we asked him to, to-go our cheesecakes he said he already told the front desk to have them in their boxes, but then they ended up bringing the cheesecakes in their plates and not in boxes.  But besides that one server who wasn't so great towards me and my family, the others who served us were great and nice. The restaurant serves many different type of food from salad, salmon, pastas, and sandwiches. Their cheesecakes, of course, are greatly made and taste very delicious!

I had the Monte Cristo which for some reason came with no egg on it, first kid ordered chicken and waffles (adult menu) with no hollandaise. First came out with it second came out with the eggs soaking in water on top of the waffle. Second person ordered a cheeseburger it came out literally bun, cheese and a burger. Not one condiment. My mom ordered the chicken avocado sandwich , came out with no avocado. Extreme fail!! Have been to multiple locations but this one definitely needs new cooks. To top it off we got not only a full bill but they charged me for the kids drink that came with my daughters meal.

I have had it in Indiana as well and it was extremely good there. The last two times I've had it here at this particular location, was put together very quickly, hardly had any of the ingredients on it that was supposed to come with it. The dressing that they put on the side was very sparse. After I expressly told the server when I ordered it that I would like the dressing on the salad, as this was a kale Salad which is a lot better when the salad dressing is massaged into it.

TWO people ordered food that they were ""out"" of. I've always thought that Cheesecake Factory's menu was ridiculous and couldn't imagine what it takes to be able to offer basically EVERYTHING on their menu.

We had to use candles taken from the bar to be able to see the menu. and (B) the music is a bit too loud. It was too dang noisy for us ""over the hill"" types. A lower volume would be nice. On the plus side, the iced tea was good and the fried catfish was cooked just right (well done), and the Fish Tacos (tempura battered) were very good as well. The black beans were seasoned just right but the rice pilaf needs some improvement. It was too greasy. We also liked the dark bread and butter they serve with the meal. We were too stuffed to eat any cheesecake but next time we will get some. This was our first visit to this location.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard,3.24,3.36,3.048,,3.3120000000000007
465,Patricia G.,"Beaverton, United States",32,102,183.0,2.0,2018-11-01,"I recently just started to eat here again.  My last visit I got the chicken avocado club with fries. I was impressed, the service had improved, I liked the new items and variety on the menu.  I went today, Trent was my waiter, I want to say that first off he was amazing and the only reason I have the review any stars. He was helpful, he checked in often and was prompt.  Today I had the Shepard's pie, comfort food on a rainy day. About bite #2 I felt something a little tough I figured it was just the zucchini skin, then bite #6 I found another piece. Only to see it was a piece of blue thread.  Jeff the manager seemed surprised and didn't feel like he believed me, until I showed him the picture I took for yelp! He told me not to worry they would cover my food. It felt as if he was telling me he was doing me a favor. I wouldn't pay for food with an item in it anywhere! I asked to pay for my drink so I could leave a tip.  It will be awhile before I will even think of returning.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard,3.24,3.37,3.04,,3.318
468,Jen T.,"Phoenix, United States",33,287,,3.0,2018-12-01,"I've been to a few Cheesecake Factory locations around the country. I've lived in far too many big cities to not have been to a few. At any rate, this one seemed a little sub-par. The wait was ridiculous. I get it if there aren't any tables, that's not what I mean. What I mean is, after our one hour wait for a table, we waited more than 40 minutes to get a server to acknowledge that we were there, and another 40 minutes before our food came out. TWO people ordered food that they were ""out"" of. I've always thought that Cheesecake Factory's menu was ridiculous and couldn't imagine what it takes to be able to offer basically EVERYTHING on their menu. It's not a problem in other locations, but what are the odds that TWO items aren't available because of a missing ingredient? INCONCEIVABLE! Or poorly planned/managed. I doubt they'll ever go out of business because of their location, and the food that we had was amazing - but the whole ""experience"" of dining was a bust this time.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard,3.32,3.35,3.036,,3.338
