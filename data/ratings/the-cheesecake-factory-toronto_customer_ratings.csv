148,Cassandra C.,"Courtice, Canada",3,29,29.0,5.0,2017-01-12,"We were so excited to make the journey to Yorkdale to try out Canada's first Cheesecake Factory. We arrived at the mall around 11:00 and saw the line was crazy long. We decide it was early and would circle back. Around 3:30 we went back to see there was no line at the host stand. We spoke to the host and she said that we would get a buzzer and to come back in about an hour and check in. So we continue to shop around the stores close to the restaurant and the time passed rather quickly. We went back in a hour and she said we had about 30 more mins. So we just hung out waiting for our buzzer to go off, once it did we basically got our table right away.   We were both starved and saw all the pasta dishes passing us by, that looked very good. So we both decided to order pasta I had the pasta carbonara with chicken and it was SO good creamy and cheesy everything a good carbonara is suppose to be. I had the lunch portion and it was still very large. My friend had a cheesy garlic pasta with chicken and herbs she quiet enjoyed it and her dinner portion was too large to finish.  After we finished our meals our waitress told us that we needed to order the cheesecake we wanted cause there is about a 30min wait due to the large amounts of cheesecake being ordered.  So as difficult as it was we made our choices I had the Carmel pecan turtle cheesecake and my friend had the lemon raspberry cheesecake. We both thoroughly enjoy them and each order a couple slices to go to bring home to jealous and drooling family members. Our waitress was very helpful and accommodating she made it seem like everyone does that.  Overall we thought the experience was great and well worth the trip. We would definitely return again.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-toronto?start=40,3.604,3.604,3.604,3.604,3.6040000000000005
196,John L.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",1,13,34.0,2.0,2017-01-12,"I understand it's their first few weeks but I am disappointed. We waited 1 and 1/2 until we get our buzzer. Then only  15 min and we were seated. Not Bad. We waited another half an hour before we got our meal. Again, I am ok with the wait. However , the soup was lukewarm. We asked the waiter if he can nuke it. He brought it back and said ""this time , it's hot at 110°. It was still cold. The meatloaf was also warm, not hot. I think the meal was sitting under the heat lamp for a while. We ordered cheesecake after the meal and had to wait 45 min. Anyway, I will wait until the new year to try again. They have a lot of training to do. I expected more from a well established organization.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-toronto?start=60,3.2720000000000002,3.2720000000000002,3.2720000000000002,3.2720000000000002,3.2720000000000002
172,Kenny N.,"Vaughan, Canada",39,66,36.0,4.0,2017-01-12,"The hype is real.  Coming to the mall on a Friday at around 1 for some Christmas shopping, I saw the line for The Cheesecake Factory and boy did I underestimate how long the wait would be.  We decided to do some shopping first and then head down to eat around 6. The line had gotten longer and we were told that this particular line is just to get a receiver. Then the wait would be about 2.5-3 hours from there. We thought it was just an overestimate from their part.. it was not.  During our wait, we made sure to know exactly what to order so we didn't waste any time. It was around 10:30 by the time we were seated. We were so close to giving up on waiting multiple times lol.  The service was exceptional and prompt. Our waitress (I forgot her name) was very friendly and she checked up on us multiple times throughout the night. The appetizers, especially the stuffed mushrooms were super yummy! I had Evelyn's favourite pasta and I guess I always get sick of too much pasta, but it tasted good to begin with.  The lighting is just so perfect. It's dim and creates a very cozy atmosphere. I wish it was slightly more spacious though.  If you've never had cheesecake from here before, do yourself a favour and treat yourself. The white chocolate raspberry is my absolute favourite.

Once we were seated it took another 30 mins just to get drinks at our table, they also ran out of Stella.. Our server had to keep coming back to tell us that the apps we ordered were sold out / some of our entrees were sold out as well. We ended up having to go for our 3rd / 4th choices for some items which was a huge disappointment... but surprisingly it was pretty good! Food was worth going there for.

186,Mae F.,"Milton, Canada",56,150,229.0,3.0,2017-02-12,"This review is based on getting take out cheesecake from here since my husband and I were too full to dine in. We also didn't have time anyway to wait in the line up, though it was shorter (15 people) than the usual hundreds in line from what I've heard. We came here on a Monday (late afternoon) and it took only a few minutes to order the cheesecake slices that we wanted, which was great. It actually took us longer to decide what we wanted to get than the actual ordering process. We ordered the red velvet, coffee chocolate and Oreo dream cheesecake slices, which came out to about $30 in total. It was puzzling to be told that it would be a 40 minutes wait to get three slices of cheesecake though, considering that the cheesecake slices in the display were already sliced up. Anyway, we walked around Yorkdale in the meantime and came back to get the slices, which were waiting on the counter along with the other orders. We ate the cheesecake slices over the course of the week and all were delicious, though a bit smaller than what I remember from several visits to the U.S. locations in past years. I wish that the prices were a bit lower and the portions were larger but that being said, we'll still probably be back to brave the crowds to dine in at some point in the next few months.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-toronto?start=60,3.628,3.628,3.628,3.628,3.628
139,Chris T.,"Toronto, Canada",25,92,457.0,3.0,2017-02-12,"The food was just ok. Definitely not worth the average wait time of 1.5+ hours - unless you REALLY want their cheesecake. But if that's all you want get it to go. Our family decided to go today on a Saturday morning while doing some Christmas shopping. I was hoping the food would taste as good as it does in the United states. But alas, it did NOT. We ordered the factory nachos: 5/5 stars - it was LOADED with cheese and had a generous amount of guacamole & jalapenos. Only get it if you like it heavy! The Dynamite tempura shrimp and Ahi tuna tartare were a disappointment. Did not taste good at all. Both 1/5 stars and costs about $10 each.  The Philly cheese steak sandwich was 3/5. I've had better, at a fraction of the price.  Do not get the fries as your side!! The fries were hard, cold and tasteless.  The Diane steak (3/5 stars)was nothing to write home about. And at almost $28, you might as well go to a buffet.  $100+ later.... We should have just gotten the cheesecake to go.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-toronto,3.692,3.692,3.692,3.692,3.692

The line up was insane (1hr to get a buzzer, then another 3hr wait around the mall) but nonetheless my friends and I were excited when it was finally our turn! Quality of the food is just like when I had it in buffalo. Menu has lots of selection, portions are huge. The fried Mac and cheese is really good for appetizer. Most of us ordered pasta and while it tasted great, it is more on the salty side. The highlight was definitely the cheesecakes at the end of the meal. Our table ordered the red velvet, Godiva, banana pudding, anniversary and tiramisu cheesecakes. Of them all the red velvet was my favourite - it was really light and not too sweet! Tiramisu and Godiva were my second favourite.

There are two lines u have to wait through and then you get in. After walking inside, the atmosphere felt very vivid and exclusive as the restaurant had an exquisite feel to it. Finally sitting down, man oh man, the seats were so terrific! felt like chairs from Cuba or some exotic place like that. Bringing the bread out as a starter, the first one was dry, old, and stale like my stats prof, however the second one was rich in flavour and blended well with the butter. The pasta we ordered with the chicken, mushrooms, tomatoes was $23.95 and definitely worth it as the portion size is bigger then my forehead and is suited for 2. The strawberry cheesecake, gurl don't even get me started on that, that shit was  , it was heavenly as  tears came out of my fat little face with each bite, unfortunately I had to share with my gf so don't make that mistake when u go in but it's ok u win some u lose some u know?

The food was amazing and big portions, the staff were super friendly, and the decor was nice. I don't recommend coming here if you're solely coming for cheesecake unless they have one that other places don't sell (most of the Coffee Culture cafes, sell the same Cheesecake Factory cakes for cheaper prices and no wait times). But where it stands out is the meals. I definitely recommend the porky belly sliders and orange chicken special. Yum!

If you're here just for cheesecake - do take out; it's faster, and usually no line to do it. It seems as if all the other negative ratings here are mostly from the wait - well guess what: the hype is real with this location.

Once in line I saw that half the restaurant was empty - so I proceeded to the counter and asked why they were building a line with so many empty seats inside.  Was offered a seat at the bar, which I gladly accepted. Total wait time: 2 mins.  Staff were friendly and helpful. Gave us tips on ordering cheesecake (to go) before we ordered so that it would be ready by the time we were done eating.  Ordered a bunch of delicious food (see pics).

The wait line of course is horrible for a Tuesday (1hr 20 mins) after 1pm so i do really recommend everyone to wait until the hype die down a bit before making a visit.  Appetizers we picked tuna tartare and crab cake bites. Both portion were actually smaller than we thought but it did fill up.  The tuna tartare has a balanced flavours of soy and ginger, the avocado chunk at the base separately from the fish make the dish presentable. The chips were a bit too oily.  The crab cake bites came with 6 pieces, mayo and lemon wedge on the side. I Expected it to be more crunchy.  theres a decent amount of crab in the little bites which is worth it.  Jambalaya pasta with shrimp and chicken came in huge portion with a mixed of regular pasta and spinach pasta. I like my pasta more al dente tho. Pasta wasn't rinse thoroughly so it was clumped a bit. Sauce was well seasoned, no complaints.  Almond crusted salmon salad served with kale, quinoa, dried cranberry and dressed in light sweetened balsamic. Salmon skin is crispy and the crusted is not too heavy which makes the dish overall not bad  Tiramisu cheesecake is amazing. The cheesecake part is not dense, more of a mouse texture which makes it light and not so rich to indulge the whole thing. Base is sponge(lady finger) cake soaked w coffee or kahlua just like a regular tiramisu, two of my fave desserts combine into one make so much sense, i do enjoy it !",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-toronto?start=60,3.7600000000000002,3.7600000000000002,3.7600000000000002,3.7600000000000002,3.7600000000000007

The service was exceptional though. Our waiter was super friendly and always managed to check up on us even though it was super busy. We ordered the tacos and the spinach dip to share.

I've heard many good things about this restaurant, so once I heard The Cheesecake Factory was opening a location in Yorkdale, I had to try it out.  I went on a Saturday morning around 10:30am, we were told the wait would be about an hour and were given a buzzer. By the time we walked around the mall the hour was already up. We made our way back to the front desk to ask how much longer and a staff member kindly checked for us. We were next to be buzzed & ended up getting seated 5 minutes later.  We were seated in a booth beside a window. Our server (forgot his name) was amazing, made good recommendations considering it was our first time, was very attentive, friendly, and checked up on us regularly.  Our food came out really fast, I'd say we waited no longer than 10 minutes. They give bread in the meantime which is nice. I ordered the Fish Tacos (roughly $19), it comes with 4 decent sized tacos as well as rice and beans on the side, I highly recommend this dish!! My boyfriend ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta (roughly $20), he enjoyed his meal as well.  As for dessert, we had a hard time narrowing it down to only two cheesecakes out of the dozens of delicious ones they have, but we finally decided on the Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake and the Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake (both about $9 each). Soo good! Very smooth and creamy, we enjoyed both.  Overall the lineup wasn't too bad since we went early, the staff here are very friendly and the food is pretty good!

Unless the chef just didn't want to make it anymore....or their entrees are premade and frozen. The cheesecake options are also huge, but the quality isn't mind blowing for the price you have to pay.

The hostess told us 60-80 mins, be here 10 mins before to ensure you get buzzed in. After shopping and going around, we came 10 mins earlier and they buzzed us in 5 mins. They sat us in and we immediately ordered. The decor and ambiance looks the same as any Cheesecake Factory restaurant which is great! The server was great and friendly, the bread and butter tasted amazing (my fave part).  We ordered the buffalo blasts, very HEFTY portion! This lasted till my lunch the next day. I ordered their special for the day which is a Thai glazed salmon and my fiancé got the Louisiana chicken pasta. Both were really amazingly done dishes but I was a big fan of their salmon! It was sooooo jam packed with flavour!  I love Cheesecake Factory for their food and less for their cheesecake, a little to heavy for me but when I do order a cheesecake to share, my faves are red velvet and the fresh strawberry original cheesecake! But that night we ordered strawberry shortcake sooooooooooo gooooood!  Amazing way to be the meal! Cheesecake Factory prices are fair to be honest, it's obviously in CAD dollars so it's a bit pricey but you really can't knock it down because of their hefty portions!  Obviously it's going to be a long time till the crowd dies down which is obvious, but I'll gladly wait again just to eat their food. There is also a huge for take out! Cheesecake Factory will always have a special place in my heart.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-toronto?start=20,3.84,3.84,3.84,3.728,3.84
151,Monika W.,"Toronto, Canada",1,74,65.0,3.0,2017-11-12,"Friday night 4hrs to get a table for 6 (started lining up before 5pm). Staff were young and energetic, food was surprisingly good, portions were big, but it's a huge time commitment. The table turnover is very slow; there was major confusion when it came time to bring over the cheesecakes. Vegetarians: there's not much for you in terms of entrees - veggie burger and salad. But there are lots of great appetizers instead. I opted for the fish and chips, they were on the salty side but still good and the potion was generous. I'll come back in a few years or just drive to one in Buffalo to avoid the crowds next time.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-toronto?start=40,3.88,3.88,3.88,3.66,3.88
179,Jennie L.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",72,52,72.0,4.0,2017-11-12,"Came here with my husband and parents on Sunday of the Black Friday weekend. Got in front of the restaurant at 2pm, and was seated at 530pm. The most annoying part of the wait is that you have to physically line up just to get to the podium and get a buzzer. I waited in line for around 45 minutes before getting my buzzer. Once you get the buzzer, you are free to go walk around the mall and do whatever you want. The buzzer only works in the vicinity of the restaurant, so they'll give you an approximate time of when you should come back to the restaurant. Once you are seated, the service is very good and quick. Our waiter was very friendly, took our orders and checked in on us a few times. He also gave us the heads up that the cheesecakes were taking a bit longer, so had us order the cheesecakes right before we got our main, so that we didn't have to wait too long for the dessert after.  The food was on par with the US. My go to appetizer is the avocado spring rolls. I highly recommend these. It comes with 6 pieces, which I think might be a smaller portion than the US (but I might also be remembering wrong). The appetizer came really quickly, and once we finished that, didn't have to wait very long for the mains. We got two cheesecakes. The banana creme is amazing and very nice and light. The white chocolate macadamia was a bit too heavy for us, the first two bites were yummy, and then it was just too creamy and sweet.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-toronto?start=20,3.88,3.88,3.88,3.728,3.88

FYI - it's on the sweet side  7) Hershey cheesecake - this was AMAZING. If you love chocolate, get this! It's really rich and creamy, and you have to share it because it's huge.  8) tuxedo cheesecake - this was really good too, and was lighter and tasted more like a mousse.  Keep in mind: the portion sizes for everything are HUGE. You can share the mains with 2-3 people, or just take your leftovers home. So for the price, you're definitely getting your moneys worth.

The restaurant itself is almost identical to all other Cheesecake Factories we've seen from east coast to west coast in our travels throughout the states, which is definitely a plus.  On to the food: my wife ordered her regular angel hair shrimp pasta in marinara sauce, which they were able to sub in fettuccini no problem, and I had the factory burrito grande. I can't complain about the burrito, it tasted decent and the chicken was seasoned nicely. The shrimp pasta, on the other hand, was dry and very bland. Our waiter gladly took it back to the kitchen for us and had them remake it. Unfortunately, the kitchens idea of correcting a bland marinara pasta was to add a mountain of diced tomatoes, which only helped make the pasta more sour and much less palatable. Manager came out to see us afterwards to see if he could change out my wife's dish, but at that point we had spent the last 2.5 hrs at factory and I was more than halfway through my meal, so we just wanted to get to dessert already. We opted to order dessert to go as we were becoming anxious from sitting at our table so long. This wasn't an easy process either, however. Our waiter took our cheesecake orders (7 in total), but messed up on so many things I care not to elaborate here. Let's just say the cheesecake order took another hour itself. Got all of them in front of me now, but can't comment on taste until we get home, hopefully all is good.  On to the service: our waiter was quite personable and prompt, and I'm assuming under supervision still as another waiter continuously observed him in action. He was quite attentive to our concerns and prompt at addressing that which needed to be addressed. The manager also appeared rather concerned about out unsatisfying experience so far, and after implying it to him, he offered to ""take the pasta off the bill"", a gesture that normally would be offered without prompting.  Overall, I was somewhat underwhelmed by the opening. The experience was very different from what we've come to expect from Cheesecake Factory. In all fairness, I understand that this is the first restaurant to open in Canada, and these growing pains are to be expected.

I know it's the first week being open, but come on. I've been to The Cheesecake Factory in Vegas and lineups can be crazy there, too. But they managed things much better in Vegas.  My experience was for takeout. I called in my order at around 11:45am. The person I spoke to said my food would be ready in half an hour.  I knew it was going to be busy, but the website stated they had designated parking for takeout orders and you could call when you arrive to see if your food is ready. It even says they'll bring your food out to your car (not true). I called the number when I arrived at the restaurant and they said it wasn't ready but they were working on it. When I asked how long it would take, she hung up on me. To avoid the nightmare of parking, I stopped in the parking lot and my friend got out to pick up the food.  I waited ten minutes and called the curbside pickup line again. No answer this time. I called twice more with no luck. I finally got a parking spot and went inside. I was immediately blocked by an employee who told me to get in line. Look, I understand it's busy, but employees should ask ""how can I help you?"" Instead of, ""you need to get in line"". I told her I was meeting my friend who was already in line so she let me in. There were lines EVERYWHERE. You basically had to line up to get in another line. When I found my friend, she was in the mall side in a very long line with four or five people in front of her. There were bags and bags of food lined up for people to pick up.  I thought it would be about five more minutes to get our food, but no. We waited another 20 minutes, because this line was for both people ordering takeout as well as picking up. I've never waited so long to pick up my food from any restaurant. When I finally got to the front, they confirmed my order by checking every item in the bag. Perhaps they've had a few mixups in the past, so it was good they verified everything. However, it was 12:48pm at that time. A full hour after I ordered and more than half an hour waiting in line, the whole time my food was sitting there. Of course, the food was cold by the time we finally got to eat it. I nuked mine, but some things just don't taste as good when you do that. We shared the egg roll sampler, chicken quesadilla and zucchini sticks and another friend had a chicken pasta lunch special (don't recall the name).  They really need to get things sorted out. One line to order takeout, and one line to pay/pick up your food that you already ordered. Simple. The food was fine, but would've been so much better when it was hot (or at least warm enough that it didn't require reheating) I'll go back in the new year after the hype has died down a bit, and update my review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-toronto?start=20,4.08,4.08,4.08,2.9840000000000004,4.08

Then after, they will give you a buzzer where the furthest you can wonder during your wait was as far as Victoria secret. Our server was very polite and friendly. Even though restaurant was crazy busy, we didn't have to wait long for our food. We ordered three different appetizers which include spinach dip, calamari, and Caesar salad. The spinach dip was good but I thought they didn't give enough chips. It was nice that they also served the dip with salsa and sour cream on the side. Calamari in my opinion was just meeeehhhhhh. Caesar salad was good but the dressing had a hint of spiciness to it. We ordered four different mains to share. There was a chicken filet dish with pasta on the side (I forgot the name but it was delicious), Diane steak with mash potato, chicken and Diane steak combo with sweet potato fries, and a pasta that tasted like a pizza. All the mains were decent.  Last but not least, we obviously ordered cheesecakes. We had four different ones...red velvet, tiramisu cheesecake, salted caramel, and strawberry shortcake. Red velvet and tiramisu were the winners! I loved how the tiramisu one was light even those cheesecake was suppose to be somewhat heavy. Salted caramel in my opinion was just wayyyyyy to sweet. I felt like I ate like 10k calories just from that one (sugar overload). The strawberry shortcake was such a disappointment as well. Was totally not what we expected.

No bread was offered.  Had to ask for that delicious brown one.  Not sure if they forgot to offer or they just don't if you're seated at the bar ordering dinner. Told there was a 45 min wait for cheesecake so I ordered my cheesecake at the same time as my meal.  Got the Adam's peanut butter cup and it was divine.  It arrived when my meal did which was fine by me. The waitress entered my meal incorrectly so it arrived wrong, and then they sent it back and forgot a key protein in the dish the second round.  Back it went again, and after 20 minutes it came out and was perfect.  Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp.  One of the tastiest things on that giant menu.  Order it with the ""cilantro rice"".  You won't be disappointed. Servers were super helpful.  It was clear that they brought some from the states to help with opening week.  It was easy to tell who was new and who was experienced.  They were all very pleasant though. Considering I was there for their first week, I was pretty happy with the overall experience.  Because they have so many other restaurants in the states, I only offer a little leniency for not having things running a little smoother.  Th pure volume of people is one thing, but once the restaurant is full, it's like any other full Cheesecake Factory restaurant in the states... and they should be prepared for the crowd and ensure their new staff are up to par.  First Canadian operation though, so I do acknowledge the learning curve.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-toronto?start=100,3.48,3.48,3.48,3.408,3.4800000000000004

No bread was offered.  Had to ask for that delicious brown one.  Not sure if they forgot to offer or they just don't if you're seated at the bar ordering dinner. Told there was a 45 min wait for cheesecake so I ordered my cheesecake at the same time as my meal.  Got the Adam's peanut butter cup and it was divine.  It arrived when my meal did which was fine by me. The waitress entered my meal incorrectly so it arrived wrong, and then they sent it back and forgot a key protein in the dish the second round.  Back it went again, and after 20 minutes it came out and was perfect.  Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp.  One of the tastiest things on that giant menu.  Order it with the ""cilantro rice"".  You won't be disappointed. Servers were super helpful.  It was clear that they brought some from the states to help with opening week.  It was easy to tell who was new and who was experienced.  They were all very pleasant though. Considering I was there for their first week, I was pretty happy with the overall experience.  Because they have so many other restaurants in the states, I only offer a little leniency for not having things running a little smoother.  Th pure volume of people is one thing, but once the restaurant is full, it's like any other full Cheesecake Factory restaurant in the states... and they should be prepared for the crowd and ensure their new staff are up to par.  First Canadian operation though, so I do acknowledge the learning curve.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-toronto?start=100,3.52,3.52,3.52,3.472,3.5200000000000005

We arrived at the mall around 11:00 and saw the line was crazy long. We decide it was early and would circle back. Around 3:30 we went back to see there was no line at the host stand. We spoke to the host and she said that we would get a buzzer and to come back in about an hour and check in. So we continue to shop around the stores close to the restaurant and the time passed rather quickly. We went back in a hour and she said we had about 30 more mins. So we just hung out waiting for our buzzer to go off, once it did we basically got our table right away.   We were both starved and saw all the pasta dishes passing us by, that looked very good. So we both decided to order pasta I had the pasta carbonara with chicken and it was SO good creamy and cheesy everything a good carbonara is suppose to be. I had the lunch portion and it was still very large. My friend had a cheesy garlic pasta with chicken and herbs she quiet enjoyed it and her dinner portion was too large to finish.  After we finished our meals our waitress told us that we needed to order the cheesecake we wanted cause there is about a 30min wait due to the large amounts of cheesecake being ordered.  So as difficult as it was we made our choices I had the Carmel pecan turtle cheesecake and my friend had the lemon raspberry cheesecake. We both thoroughly enjoy them and each order a couple slices to go to bring home to jealous and drooling family members. Our waitress was very helpful and accommodating she made it seem like everyone does that.  Overall we thought the experience was great and well worth the trip. We would definitely return again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-toronto?start=40,3.48,3.48,3.48,3.636,3.4800000000000004

Coming to the mall on a Friday at around 1 for some Christmas shopping, I saw the line for The Cheesecake Factory and boy did I underestimate how long the wait would be.  We decided to do some shopping first and then head down to eat around 6. The line had gotten longer and we were told that this particular line is just to get a receiver. Then the wait would be about 2.5-3 hours from there. We thought it was just an overestimate from their part.. it was not.  During our wait, we made sure to know exactly what to order so we didn't waste any time. It was around 10:30 by the time we were seated. We were so close to giving up on waiting multiple times lol.  The service was exceptional and prompt. Our waitress (I forgot her name) was very friendly and she checked up on us multiple times throughout the night. The appetizers, especially the stuffed mushrooms were super yummy! I had Evelyn's favourite pasta and I guess I always get sick of too much pasta, but it tasted good to begin with.  The lighting is just so perfect. It's dim and creates a very cozy atmosphere. I wish it was slightly more spacious though.

We also didn't have time anyway to wait in the line up, though it was shorter (15 people) than the usual hundreds in line from what I've heard. We came here on a Monday (late afternoon) and it took only a few minutes to order the cheesecake slices that we wanted, which was great. It actually took us longer to decide what we wanted to get than the actual ordering process. We ordered the red velvet, coffee chocolate and Oreo dream cheesecake slices, which came out to about $30 in total. It was puzzling to be told that it would be a 40 minutes wait to get three slices of cheesecake though, considering that the cheesecake slices in the display were already sliced up. Anyway, we walked around Yorkdale in the meantime and came back to get the slices, which were waiting on the counter along with the other orders. We ate the cheesecake slices over the course of the week and all were delicious, though a bit smaller than what I remember from several visits to the U.S. locations in past years.

The wait line of course is horrible for a Tuesday (1hr 20 mins) after 1pm so i do really recommend everyone to wait until the hype die down a bit before making a visit.  Appetizers we picked tuna tartare and crab cake bites. Both portion were actually smaller than we thought but it did fill up.  The tuna tartare has a balanced flavours of soy and ginger, the avocado chunk at the base separately from the fish make the dish presentable. The chips were a bit too oily.  The crab cake bites came with 6 pieces, mayo and lemon wedge on the side. I Expected it to be more crunchy.  theres a decent amount of crab in the little bites which is worth it.  Jambalaya pasta with shrimp and chicken came in huge portion with a mixed of regular pasta and spinach pasta. I like my pasta more al dente tho. Pasta wasn't rinse thoroughly so it was clumped a bit. Sauce was well seasoned, no complaints.  Almond crusted salmon salad served with kale, quinoa, dried cranberry and dressed in light sweetened balsamic. Salmon skin is crispy and the crusted is not too heavy which makes the dish overall not bad  Tiramisu cheesecake is amazing. The cheesecake part is not dense, more of a mouse texture which makes it light and not so rich to indulge the whole thing. Base is sponge(lady finger) cake soaked w coffee or kahlua just like a regular tiramisu, two of my fave desserts combine into one make so much sense, i do enjoy it !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-toronto?start=60,3.88,3.88,3.88,3.248,3.88

Service was good but had multiple issues with their interac connection.  Ordered the pork belly sliders, bellagio, and two cheesecakes. All were good but the portion size of the cheesecake is small! Surprising since we have been to a few locations in the U.S. and the sizes are much bigger. This is what this restaurant is famous or infamous for --their gigantic serving. For $10 a slice it would have been nice to have the large portion as we've come to expect.

82,Monique K.,"Scarborough, Toronto, Canada",1,5,8.0,5.0,2017-12-10,"My experience here was great! I've heard many good things about this restaurant, so once I heard The Cheesecake Factory was opening a location in Yorkdale, I had to try it out.  I went on a Saturday morning around 10:30am, we were told the wait would be about an hour and were given a buzzer. By the time we walked around the mall the hour was already up. We made our way back to the front desk to ask how much longer and a staff member kindly checked for us. We were next to be buzzed & ended up getting seated 5 minutes later.  We were seated in a booth beside a window. Our server (forgot his name) was amazing, made good recommendations considering it was our first time, was very attentive, friendly, and checked up on us regularly.  Our food came out really fast, I'd say we waited no longer than 10 minutes. They give bread in the meantime which is nice. I ordered the Fish Tacos (roughly $19), it comes with 4 decent sized tacos as well as rice and beans on the side, I highly recommend this dish!! My boyfriend ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta (roughly $20), he enjoyed his meal as well.  As for dessert, we had a hard time narrowing it down to only two cheesecakes out of the dozens of delicious ones they have, but we finally decided on the Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake and the Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake (both about $9 each). Soo good! Very smooth and creamy, we enjoyed both.  Overall the lineup wasn't too bad since we went early, the staff here are very friendly and the food is pretty good!

Got in front of the restaurant at 2pm, and was seated at 530pm. The most annoying part of the wait is that you have to physically line up just to get to the podium and get a buzzer. I waited in line for around 45 minutes before getting my buzzer. Once you get the buzzer, you are free to go walk around the mall and do whatever you want. The buzzer only works in the vicinity of the restaurant, so they'll give you an approximate time of when you should come back to the restaurant. Once you are seated, the service is very good and quick. Our waiter was very friendly, took our orders and checked in on us a few times. He also gave us the heads up that the cheesecakes were taking a bit longer, so had us order the cheesecakes right before we got our main, so that we didn't have to wait too long for the dessert after.  The food was on par with the US. My go to appetizer is the avocado spring rolls. I highly recommend these. It comes with 6 pieces, which I think might be a smaller portion than the US (but I might also be remembering wrong). The appetizer came really quickly, and once we finished that, didn't have to wait very long for the mains. We got two cheesecakes. The banana creme is amazing and very nice and light. The white chocolate macadamia was a bit too heavy for us, the first two bites were yummy, and then it was just too creamy and sweet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-toronto?start=20,3.92,3.92,3.92,2.8000000000000003,3.92

First off...yes! There's obviously a line up. Came here on a Wednesday night and I couldn't believe the line up that formed just to get a buzzer! Almost an hour wait for it but once you get the buzzer and they tell you how long the wait will be... you are free to roam the mall but know that your buzzer signal won't reach that far to let you know that your table is ready. The hostess told us 60-80 mins, be here 10 mins before to ensure you get buzzed in. After shopping and going around, we came 10 mins earlier and they buzzed us in 5 mins. They sat us in and we immediately ordered. The decor and ambiance looks the same as any Cheesecake Factory restaurant which is great! The server was great and friendly, the bread and butter tasted amazing (my fave part).  We ordered the buffalo blasts, very HEFTY portion! This lasted till my lunch the next day. I ordered their special for the day which is a Thai glazed salmon and my fiancé got the Louisiana chicken pasta. Both were really amazingly done dishes but I was a big fan of their salmon! It was sooooo jam packed with flavour!  I love Cheesecake Factory for their food and less for their cheesecake, a little to heavy for me but when I do order a cheesecake to share, my faves are red velvet and the fresh strawberry original cheesecake! But that night we ordered strawberry shortcake sooooooooooo gooooood!  Amazing way to be the meal! Cheesecake Factory prices are fair to be honest, it's obviously in CAD dollars so it's a bit pricey but you really can't knock it down because of their hefty portions!  Obviously it's going to be a long time till the crowd dies down which is obvious, but I'll gladly wait again just to eat their food. There is also a huge for take out!

Luckily skipped that horrendous line up that wraps around Victoria secret just to get that buzzer and your name down.  We got sat down at the booths near the mall entrance ( try not to sit there because it's freezing cold cause of the mall entrance door)  Problem is they seated us fast, however have awfully lazy servers who never checked up on our table, and our food took 1hour to come!!! We ordered the Topical blended drinknwith raspberry swirl, Nashville  bites, Pizza Parmigana with angel hair pasta, Orange chicken ( for fun) and the Spicy Chicken and Shrimp Cajun pasta.  Now these are all dishes we enjoy very much in the USA. And find delicious and well balanced flavours.  However at Cheesecake in Canada, our rules, regulations and safety standard's definitly tweaked the taste ... and not in a good way! The meat all tasted like a Tofu substitute or maybe 30% meat and rest filler. The Pizza Style Parmigana is supposed to be chopped up and seasoned chicken breast. Like I said it tasted like seasoned tofu or processed fake chicken meats! Didn't expect that with Canada's high food standards.  The food was all SALT salt salt. But not no sugar to create the blissful perfection of sweet and savoury ( which is for sure the reasons why we eat out ! Seasoning)  So salty we couldn't stomach It, and packed up to go containers.  Getting back to the sad part of waiting 1 hour to received our food, while watchinf others getting their mains, who had arrived before us . There were others in the same or worse boat than us ! Waiting 2 hours for their food.  Now this is where it gets good, the Cajun pasta, changed the seasoning from the USA one added more salt and less Cayenne and Paprika. The seasoning wasn't spicy like usual. This dish is the reason why my husband and I are on the toilet and sick!!! Very disappointed in the standards and how this restaurant was run. No good first impressions here.  The staff were dismissive when complaints were made by us, snickering and gossiping about customers at their attendent station, and management was so flustered they forgot why they are even at our table. I watched endlessly as our experience also was what everyone else felt too in our section !  The management blamed our one dish as the reason the rest of food was late, however it happened to be the coldest thing we got lol....  Anyways I have said enough. I understand it will never be the same as USA. But it isn't even close to reaching the first hurdle in service, quality and taste. ! I dont recommend this or even wasting time waiting. Your better off hopping over to Buffalo and having it where it's made right !!  Seriously disappointed at this opening of an amazing Chain but ONLY when you eat in the USA.

When I read the reviews and saw the 4+ hours wait, I didn't believe them and now the joke's on me. I went two Saturdays ago at 5 PM and only got seated at 9:30 PM, which was actually our quoted time, because my sister spoke with the manager regarding some issues we had. For example, when she went to get the buzzer, they actually gave ours away to someone else and claimed we picked it up when we didn't. Then, other people that were waiting for less time with the same amount of people in their party got seated before us just because they complained about the long wait. Not to mention, the line-ups are super confusing. I actually went to the second line-up where you get the buzzer by accident at first, and should've just stayed there... Do yourself a favour and drive to Buffalo to eat at the Cheesecake Factory. You'll probably be seated in less time. Or come back to this location months later when they start accepting reservations. The food and portions, however, are worth it. The pastas are amazing and even after waiting as long as I did, I could only finish half of the pasta and packed the rest home along with my cheesecake. They give quite a lot of protein when you opt to add chicken or if it already comes with it. The white chocolate macadamia cheesecake was sold out though, so that was quite disappointing. I tried a bite of the farfalle pasta my sister got and really recommend it; it was so delicious. I got the four cheese pasta with chicken and everyone around told me how good it looked. It tasted even better but I kinda expected more cheese (I LOVE cheese). Love the food, great value for quality and portions, but damn the wait...

For example, when she went to get the buzzer, they actually gave ours away to someone else and claimed we picked it up when we didn't. Then, other people that were waiting for less time with the same amount of people in their party got seated before us just because they complained about the long wait. Not to mention, the line-ups are super confusing. I actually went to the second line-up where you get the buzzer by accident at first, and should've just stayed there... Do yourself a favour and drive to Buffalo to eat at the Cheesecake Factory. You'll probably be seated in less time. Or come back to this location months later when they start accepting reservations. The food and portions, however, are worth it. The pastas are amazing and even after waiting as long as I did, I could only finish half of the pasta and packed the rest home along with my cheesecake. They give quite a lot of protein when you opt to add chicken or if it already comes with it. The white chocolate macadamia cheesecake was sold out though, so that was quite disappointing. I tried a bite of the farfalle pasta my sister got and really recommend it; it was so delicious. I got the four cheese pasta with chicken and everyone around told me how good it looked. It tasted even better but I kinda expected more cheese (I LOVE cheese). Love the food, great value for quality and portions, but damn the wait... Maybe I'll come for brunch first thing in the morning and pray it will only be a 2 hour wait. I'll update my review when I do brunch.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-toronto?start=60,3.56,3.78,3.78,2.348,3.692
12,Chantal Y.,"Toronto, Canada",43,84,316.0,1.0,2017-12-14,"Where do I start off? Luckily skipped that horrendous line up that wraps around Victoria secret just to get that buzzer and your name down.  We got sat down at the booths near the mall entrance ( try not to sit there because it's freezing cold cause of the mall entrance door)  Problem is they seated us fast, however have awfully lazy servers who never checked up on our table, and our food took 1hour to come!!! We ordered the Topical blended drinknwith raspberry swirl, Nashville  bites, Pizza Parmigana with angel hair pasta, Orange chicken ( for fun) and the Spicy Chicken and Shrimp Cajun pasta.  Now these are all dishes we enjoy very much in the USA. And find delicious and well balanced flavours.  However at Cheesecake in Canada, our rules, regulations and safety standard's definitly tweaked the taste ... and not in a good way! The meat all tasted like a Tofu substitute or maybe 30% meat and rest filler. The Pizza Style Parmigana is supposed to be chopped up and seasoned chicken breast. Like I said it tasted like seasoned tofu or processed fake chicken meats! Didn't expect that with Canada's high food standards.  The food was all SALT salt salt. But not no sugar to create the blissful perfection of sweet and savoury ( which is for sure the reasons why we eat out ! Seasoning)  So salty we couldn't stomach It, and packed up to go containers.  Getting back to the sad part of waiting 1 hour to received our food, while watchinf others getting their mains, who had arrived before us . There were others in the same or worse boat than us ! Waiting 2 hours for their food.  Now this is where it gets good, the Cajun pasta, changed the seasoning from the USA one added more salt and less Cayenne and Paprika. The seasoning wasn't spicy like usual. This dish is the reason why my husband and I are on the toilet and sick!!! Very disappointed in the standards and how this restaurant was run. No good first impressions here.  The staff were dismissive when complaints were made by us, snickering and gossiping about customers at their attendent station, and management was so flustered they forgot why they are even at our table. I watched endlessly as our experience also was what everyone else felt too in our section !  The management blamed our one dish as the reason the rest of food was late, however it happened to be the coldest thing we got lol....  Anyways I have said enough. I understand it will never be the same as USA. But it isn't even close to reaching the first hurdle in service, quality and taste. ! I dont recommend this or even wasting time waiting. Your better off hopping over to Buffalo and having it where it's made right !!  Seriously disappointed at this opening of an amazing Chain but ONLY when you eat in the USA.  Good luck everyone with your journey to Cheese cake Factory !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-toronto,3.44,3.75,3.75,2.18,3.6260000000000003

This was one of the worse dining experience which is sad because Cheesecake Factory is my favorite restaurant in the USA.  My partner and I were ready for the long anticipated wait (we read the reviews beforehand and expected to wait approximately 2 hours) so we went for dinner a little later (around 9:00 PM). When we got here we got led around because there was a line to just get a buzzer (which mind you went by fast). As we got to the buzzer counter the lady said the wait time was 1 hr (which got us exited cause we expected to wait longer). But 1.5 hours go by and we were still not buzzed so we went to inquire. The lady said 15-20 mins more which totaled to 2 hrs before we were buzzed in. Then we waited just a lil more to be seated. We had ample time to look at the menu so we ordered our entrees right away. Having been to this franchise multiple times in many states I chose to get my regular dish: the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. Of course the time it took to prepare it was understandable (20 mins approximately) and 2.5 hours later we finally get served our dishes.  My pasta looked great but when I took my first bite I was utterly disgusted. The pasta was overcooked and it tasted like dough. The shrimp and chicken was cooked right but the pasta was off. I took a couple of bites to make sure and my partner agreed it was off. I had to return it and chose to just get another faster dish (cause I did not want to wait another 20 mins). I decided to get the baja chicken tacos.  That ended up taking another 20 mins To arrive! In between the management came to apologize to us about our dish which I thought was nice but it was pointless considering we were still charged for the pasta and the tacos. I had to send the receipt back again to get the pasta removed (which they erased as a ""comp serv""). I'm surprised I managed to keep my cool the entire night. This place is a mess. The food was not worth the wait. I felt bad for our server cause he had to run back and forth cause the kitchen or management kept screwing up. The service was wonderful but I can't blame the workers for the mess this restaurant is.  I waited 3.5 hours to just eat! And I seriously lost my appetite by then. It would have been faster if they had not screwed up and made me wait an additional hour. I am very disappointed in this restaurant.  You have tainted the experience for me. This is my favorite restaurant in the states and I can't believe I will never be stepping into his one again. I rather drive to the border than dine here.    I do want to add that we did end up getting the Tuxedo cheesecake and it was delicious! The only thing about the night that gave it some light.   Don't fall for the hype. If you want some cheesecake just order it to go. I hope they  will be able to live up to their reputation cause so far it's not looking good.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-toronto?start=80,3.32,3.72,3.72,2.244,3.5600000000000005

I was a little surprised by the price of a slice of cheesecake but the slice was a pretty decent size.

No longer do we have to drive 2 hours to Buffalo but instead wait 2-3 hours in a mall. It's exactly what you expect, the food is the same, the friendliness of the wait staff, the menus, the cheesecake line up at the door. We always order the Chicken Jumbalaya and Thai Lettuce wraps which are very tasty. This time we ordered the Buffalo Blasts, Stuff Potato Tots, Avocado Egg Rolls And Shrimp Angel Hair Pasta. The Angel Hair was nothing to brag about but we enjoyed the Buffalo Blasts which was a huge portion. We were disappointed that the pastas were not the expected large portions we are use to seeing in the US. We also ordered the Black Out Chocolate Cake and Godiva Gluten Free cake. They were both very rich and delicious. If you are willing to brave the wait and walk around the mall for 2-3 hours, you get what you expect.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-toronto?start=20,2.56,3.39,3.39,3.568,3.058

The cheesecake was very smooth and creamy, had great flavour and texture. It seemed to taste better than when I had it at US stores, maybe it's just extra fresh cause of the high turnover at this location.

My first experience was takeout, and I got my favourite Louisiana chicken pasta, plus the white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake . The pasta was just like the states, so I was very happy. However, I also ordered the avocado egg rolls, and it wasn't in my bag when I came home. I emailed the cheesecake factory as advised on the phone, and this issue still hasn't been resolved and it's been a few weeks. I find that to be very poor customer service, especially for a new restaurant.  I went back with my gfs last Friday to dine in for our annual secret Santa dinner. We enjoyed their wine, and also got a second bottle. The apps were very delicious, and highly recommend the stuffed mushrooms and avocado egg rolls. We also got the buffalo blasts, which were good, but huge! I ordered the chicken parm pizza and my gf ordered the jambalaya pasta. It was insanely salty. I hate sending food back, but my gf also was not able to eat it. We sent it back, and then got our food with less salt, but then it tasted absolutely bland for both of us. Our gfs were pretty much done eating so, we just ate two bites and asked to pack it up. We felt bad to send it back again but we both just didn't want to eat anymore. Our server Amanda was really nice and apologetic.  We each ordered cheesecake, and found that enjoyable. I liked my red velvet cheesecake very much.

Today is December 23, 2017.  I had my name and number of people in my group (ten) written down on the waiting list and received the buzzer.  I was also told that my entire group had to be present upon being seated at 10:00AM.  Since three out of ten of us were still on our way to the restaurant, they would not have been able to make it for 10:00AM.  We realized that and went back to see if we could change our seating time to 10:30AM.  No problem.  All was well at the time.   Pager beeped at 10:00AM and ran to the front desk with the buzzing buzzer in hand and handed the buzzer to the head hostess.  (We were later told by our server that her name was Anna, so we will call her Anna.)  Anna asked me if the rest of my group was with me.  I said yes, they are walking towards the restaurant and will be here shortly.  I asked the front desk if they were told about the time change (from 10:00AM to 10:30AM).  They were not informed about it.  I explained, ""We have seven out of ten people who are present.  The other three are running late due to traffic.  Is there any way that we can push our time to 10:30AM as the man at the front counter outside marked us down for 10:30AM."".  I was given a stern response by Anna saying-- this is not what she said exactly but it is along the lines of it--, ""We can't push other tables who are in front of you back because of your group's sluggishness.  Being stuck in traffic will take them about half an hour to get here. I'll have to cancel your table and bring in the next one"".  To her colleague Anna said ""Bring in the next one"".   Before I continue, I must explain that I'm clinically diagnosed with anxiety.  This means that I'm easily anxious under pressure.  I'm also not trying to get sympathy.  I know how busy they can be.  I understand the situation and that they couldn't help it.  I'd also like to mention that Anna's attitude was not pleasant from the get-go.

Our server was pleasant and took the time to talk to us much longer than a server would normally have time for. I later learned that this is because servers here only have 3-4 tables at a time - probably because they just opened?

I did not like how the cutlery was placed onto the tables without any napkins. I'm not sure how sanitary the tabletops are and would rather have cutlery at least placed on the dishes or napkins like an ordinary restaurant - it just looks and feels tacky and cheap.  Our waiter lacked a little experience and didn't know much about the drinks menu. They were really friendly and nice though but they had to keep going back and forth to find out about some things on the menu (understandable as the restaurant just opened). Service was moderately fast. One thing I didn't like was when they packed the food they did not pack the dressings/dipping sauce that came with the food. Food was decent, not entirely the best. The cheesecake was good, really loved the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake. The portion was huge too we had to take a few things to go. Everything was slightly pricer than average.

The tall bald man distributing buzzers was also super nice and patient! We ended up getting seated at 7:20 but he sincerely apologized for the long wait times.

Review: Yeah the wait lines are long and it's not a Michelin started restaurant, but given the price and what it sets out to be, meaning a family friendly chain of restaurant for the masses, the Cheesecake Factory excels at what it does and it's really in a class of its own.  The stuffed mushroom appetizer is to die for. The cheeseburger spring roll is really fun. The four cheese pasta is incredibly tasty and for once the pasta is truly al dente. The chicken medira is spectacular and of course, you ought to try their cheesecake. So far, the white chocolate and raspberry is my favorite. However, what impressed me even more than the food was the service. Our order of California Cheesesteak was way too salty and we had to send it back. I guess there was a screw up somewhere because it was inedible. At once the waiter told us she would alert the head chef. The manager came and confirmed that something was off and apologized right away. In no time they had redone the order (which was magnificent. Highly recommend the Cheesesteak if you crave a good sandwich) and they even offer a cheesecake on the house as an apology. The response to our complain was impeccable and it should be the benchmark against which other big chains should be measured.  Even better, they took the kids menu right away and brought them quickly. The waiters (Jonathan and Crystal) were attentive to our kids and turned the whole thing into a great experience for them. I mean the place is packed. It's probably the busiest restaurant in town right now and yet they really took great care of us. This is probably worth more than the amazing food itself.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-toronto?start=40,3.2,3.3,3.3,3.2520000000000002,3.2600000000000007

Chicken was nice and crispy, sauce was good balance of flavour and creaminess.  I ordered dulce de leche cheesecake and celebration cheesecake.

Very accommodating and attentive. They advised us that there was a long wait for cheesecake and to choose early and order it at the same time as the entree.

I like how they took two very healthy food and turned it unhealthy :P The Pasta da Vinci ($16.95 - lunch portion) had caramelized onions, mushrooms, and chicken.

81,T. B.,"Toronto, Canada",0,5,,4.0,2018-01-05,"Caved to my kids' nagging and went to Cheesecake in Yorkdale. We were a party of 5 and sat in a booth meant for 6. If your party is larger than 6 you will likely have a much, much longer wait because I don't think they have many booths for larger parties, and you would be waiting till empty tables open up near each other.  I suspect this gets easier once winter break is over. The wait: Went on a Friday. We arrived to the line shortly after 2pm. By 2:30 we had our pager and meandered around the mall until 4pm, when we were instructed to return to the ""pager-operational"" zone. By 4:20 we were seated. I found the process to be fairly efficient.  They do not accept reservations. While we didn't have a stroller with us, we noticed a ""stroller parking"" zone, as bringing them to the table is not possible (limited space).  We had two servers during our meal: Leonard (who then went on break) and another gentleman (whose name I forgot).  Both were friendly.  We had been to many Cheesecakes in the US, so we knew what to expect of the menu and décor (and the fact that WiFi is not available in the restaurant). We did not feel rushed during our meal. Food: We ordered a platter of Factory Nachos (a few of us didn't love the cheese on it and I would have liked a bit more sour cream). What was nice was that the cheese was evenly melted, which isn't always the case at other restaurants. One of us ordered the steak tacos and loved them (and the rice). My mother had a classic hamburger (a basic patty), and really liked the fries and the bun. I ordered the spicy cashew chicken.  It had a good ""kick"" to it.  The sauce is a bit sticky (I actually liked it better when I re-heated at home the next day....lots of leftovers!). For the little kiddies: there is a good selection of junior meals. My daughter had initially asked for chicken samosas, but they didn't have anymore.

Everyone else lines up! The menu is huuuuge. Seriously, don't underestimate this. What is bothersome is that some of the titles of the food seem to overlap. A lot of the pastas dishes come in a ""lunch size"" option which is really just a smaller portion but they would have their own section in the menu and the regular portions would be listed under different sections. It would have made scanning the menu easier if the food item was described and then have a side note that there are two portion sizes available rather than flipping pages to read the same thing. The Caesar salad a friend ordered was no joke, the size of a pizza pan. I ordered the carbonara and it was okay, I wouldn't abandon it altogether but I've had better and because the menu is so big I would try other dishes first. The cheesecakes are somewhat typical? I ordered the banana cream cheesecake and it was way too sweet for my liking and had more whipping cream than necessary. I've had better cheesecakes from Costco to be quite honest. The service however makes this place a little bit more enjoyable. We were seated at a sort of hub where all the employees would gather and you could tell management was well done! Our server was really sweet as well.  I would definitely go again with a large group but maybe when the hype dies down a little bit and there are no ridiculous lineups.

22,Laleh H.,"Markham, Canada",6,113,50.0,5.0,2018-01-08,"Wow - i'm stunned by the negative reviews on here. I am a huge fan of The Cheesecake Factory, i have been to several locations in the US including the Walden Galleria location (check out my review!). One thing remains the same - great quality, great service, amazing variety and huge portions! We arrived at Yorkdale Mall at 12pm. The idea was lunch and if the line up and wait time was too long, we would leave and eat somewhere else. The first thing i noticed when walking in was there was no direction or signs posted to let people know where to check in to give their names, or to line up if there was one. There was a counter to the left with 3 people behind it and a podium to the right with 1 person behind it, so i walked over to the podium. I asked if there was a wait time and how long it was. The answer was ""75-90 min with no guarantee"". That threw me off because other than people walking in & out of the mall, the entrance was clear. I asked her where we could leave our name etc. and she answered back ""there is a line up in front of Victoria's Secret"". Glad i asked otherwise there are no signs or anyone directing people that are trying to get in to the restaurant other than Security once someone tries to walk in. FYI at that time, she hadn't bothered to tell me that the line up in front of Victoria's Secret was just a line up that we had to wait in, to come back to her and give our names. That was my biggest issue with the process, not the wait time! It's a mall people. If you can't find something to do with a buzzer in your hand that allows you to go as far as Sporting Life, then that's your issue. We lined up at 12:15pm. It didn't look too bad and moved 3 times in 30 min which got us back to the main podium near the door at 12:45pm. I was given a buzzer and told to come back in 75-90 min. We sat on the benches in front of the Godiva Store with a bunch of other people also waiting for a table. We did some shopping and window shopping to pass the time. Kids had some snacks & their tablets to keep them busy.  Honestly, if it were a stand alone location, there was no chance in he$$ we would've waited even half of that. Thankful for the mall being there and so much to see & do to keep busy. We were finally seated by 2:45pm. Our server (Brittany) was great! She apologized for the wait time after introducing herself. I mentioned our daughter's peanut/nut allergy right after she greeted us. She listened carefully and said she would talk to the kitchen before any of our orders were put through. She took the kids orders and our appetizer order and went to get our drinks. We never had to flag her down or look for her. She was at our table & others frequently and made sure drinks were topped up, empty plates were cleared and ALWAYS asked if we needed anything else and how we were doing and how our meal was. Our order: Hibachi Hanger Steak w/shiitake mushrooms, onions & bean sprouts, wasabi mashed potatoes and tempura battered asparagus. My hubby loved this dish! His steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare. I couldn't try it as i have an allergy to shiitake mushrooms, but he said it was perfectly cooked & seasoned and it was a nice large portion and definitely something he would order again! I ordered the Grilled Steak Tacos - OMG this was super super delish! Honestly, i was looking at the large salads & burgers that i usually have, but decided to try something new. Hands down one of THE best steak tacos i've ever had at a restaurant - ok, other than in Mexico! 4 small tacos filled with perfectly grilled tender steak seasoned so well that i could eat nothing else and be happy! It was topped with chopped avocado, tomatoes, cilantro, crispy onions & chipotle sauce. On the side: a small bowl of black beans & a side of rice.  Our 7 yr old with the peanut/nut allergy wanted macaroni & cheese. Her food was brought out right after our appetizer by another server. She explained that it took a little longer because all the bowls & utensils to make her food were cleaned for her order to ensure no cross contamination or contact with any nut products. I was floored by this. Who does this at restaurants?! AMAZING! My daughter LOVED the macaroni & cheese! Our 4 yr old ordered chicken tenders & fries - 5 lightly battered crispy chicken tender strips. Served with 2 dipping sauces - huge hit! Red Velvet Cheesecake - OMG YUM - just try it! FYI - you can order take out at the counter to the left of the mall entrance. There is a counter with cash register & menus. Wait time is 20-30 min. If you want to order dessert to go, there is a line up at the bakery inside, or you can put an order in through your server when you are ordering your food. It saves time! They don't serve any frozen food - everything is made fresh to order. Would love to see a location at Markville Mall after their current expansion. Or Vaughan Mills.

Usually ordering some tacos at any other restaurant wouldn't be more than $15 -- but at the Cheesecake Factory basically every menu item is $20+.

Their selection of specialty dishes and cheesecakes is so large that it is a little overwhelming when it comes to choosing what to eat, especially for someone as indecisive as myself.  The first time I went, I tried the Chicken Madeira which was recommended by the server and the Tiramisu cheesecake. The Chicken Madeira is supposedly one of the most popular specialty items and it was really good; the chicken was very soft and the mashed potatoes were smooth and creamy. The size of the specialty dishes are very large, however they can be a little pricey (the Chicken Madeira costs $26). Although the portions are large, it may not be quite enough for two people. I shared the Chicken Madeira with a friend, however I think we both have a small appetite and we had plenty of bread with our dish. The Tiramisu cheesecake was very nice and light--would recommend! What's really great about the Cheesecake Factory is its unlimited bread and butter to keep you busy while you wait for your food to arrive. The servers are also pretty good at checking up on you and making sure that you have enough bread and water at all times. The servers I had during both visits were very friendly and attentive.

They handed us a buzzer and told us 1 hour and 45 minutes and we have to be in a certain vicinity. So we walked around mall and then went down and had some drinks at pickle barrell. About an hour and 15 minutes later the buzzer went off earlier than expected- which we thought was delightful. However the hostess accidentally somehow buzzed everyone on the list and there was a giant queue of confused people. They fixed the error rather quickly and we were told there is another 25 minute wait. So we just kind of stood around the bar and the buzzer went off- but at least i know why they always fighting at cheese cake!! ( please ignore lame attempt to make a drake reference). I tried the stuffed cheeseburger and it was delicious with chedder oozing out the middle and also started off with the spring roll platter that came with a choice of salmon, chicken, avacado and ground beef spring rolls with different dipping sauces. They were all good. Unfortunately i had loaded up on beer while waiting for so long that i had no room for cheesecake at the cheesecake factory.

8,Shirley L.,"Vancouver, Canada",242,376,359.0,4.0,2018-01-11,"My tip is to think about what time you ideally want to eat, and then start lining up 3 hours earlier. Even if the lineup looks short, you can probably expect to wait at least 2 hours, just given the way their process is set up. The good thing about this location is that it's in a mall, so you can walk around the shop while you wait. However, the buzzer doesn't work if you go too far, so you'll want to stay close to the restaurant when it's close to your estimated time. Other than that, it's a very standard Cheesecake Factory inside. For anyone who hasn't been, that means the same extensive menu (hundreds of options!), same affordable prices, same huge portions, same rich, decadent cheesecake. I would recommend the pasta napoletana - lots of meat (sausage, pepperoni, meatballs), and rich, hearty ingredients and flavours, served with angel hair pasta and a sauce that is both creamy and tomato-y. The chicken madeira is also really good. The chicken breast is not dry at all and is topped with melted cheese for that extra comfort food-vibe and cheesy goodness. I would not recommend the shrimp scampi. It's sauteed shrimp served with angel hair pasta and sounds delicious, but we found it was kind of bland and there wasn't enough sauce, so the noodles were dry. My mom finished her shrimp scampi dish (even though she didn't really like it, so I think the portion size was also smaller than others), but both my dad and I had leftovers to take home from our pasta napoletana and chicken madeira. I think I had about half of my pasta left and he had a third of his chicken left, so it's definitely good value for your money because you'll have meals for the next day! Also the free bread they give you is delicious (the brown one especially), and it is unlimited refills.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-toronto,3.48,3.29,3.29,3.024,3.366

Review: Yeah the wait lines are long and it's not a Michelin started restaurant, but given the price and what it sets out to be, meaning a family friendly chain of restaurant for the masses, the Cheesecake Factory excels at what it does and it's really in a class of its own.  The stuffed mushroom appetizer is to die for. The cheeseburger spring roll is really fun. The four cheese pasta is incredibly tasty and for once the pasta is truly al dente. The chicken medira is spectacular and of course, you ought to try their cheesecake. So far, the white chocolate and raspberry is my favorite. However, what impressed me even more than the food was the service. Our order of California Cheesesteak was way too salty and we had to send it back. I guess there was a screw up somewhere because it was inedible. At once the waiter told us she would alert the head chef. The manager came and confirmed that something was off and apologized right away. In no time they had redone the order (which was magnificent. Highly recommend the Cheesesteak if you crave a good sandwich) and they even offer a cheesecake on the house as an apology. The response to our complain was impeccable and it should be the benchmark against which other big chains should be measured.  Even better, they took the kids menu right away and brought them quickly. The waiters (Jonathan and Crystal) were attentive to our kids and turned the whole thing into a great experience for them. I mean the place is packed. It's probably the busiest restaurant in town right now and yet they really took great care of us.

If your party is larger than 6 you will likely have a much, much longer wait because I don't think they have many booths for larger parties, and you would be waiting till empty tables open up near each other.  I suspect this gets easier once winter break is over. The wait: Went on a Friday. We arrived to the line shortly after 2pm. By 2:30 we had our pager and meandered around the mall until 4pm, when we were instructed to return to the ""pager-operational"" zone. By 4:20 we were seated. I found the process to be fairly efficient.  They do not accept reservations. While we didn't have a stroller with us, we noticed a ""stroller parking"" zone, as bringing them to the table is not possible (limited space).  We had two servers during our meal: Leonard (who then went on break) and another gentleman (whose name I forgot).  Both were friendly.  We had been to many Cheesecakes in the US, so we knew what to expect of the menu and décor (and the fact that WiFi is not available in the restaurant). We did not feel rushed during our meal. Food: We ordered a platter of Factory Nachos (a few of us didn't love the cheese on it and I would have liked a bit more sour cream). What was nice was that the cheese was evenly melted, which isn't always the case at other restaurants. One of us ordered the steak tacos and loved them (and the rice). My mother had a classic hamburger (a basic patty), and really liked the fries and the bun. I ordered the spicy cashew chicken.  It had a good ""kick"" to it.  The sauce is a bit sticky (I actually liked it better when I re-heated at home the next day....lots of leftovers!).

Everyone else lines up! The menu is huuuuge. Seriously, don't underestimate this. What is bothersome is that some of the titles of the food seem to overlap. A lot of the pastas dishes come in a ""lunch size"" option which is really just a smaller portion but they would have their own section in the menu and the regular portions would be listed under different sections. It would have made scanning the menu easier if the food item was described and then have a side note that there are two portion sizes available rather than flipping pages to read the same thing. The Caesar salad a friend ordered was no joke, the size of a pizza pan. I ordered the carbonara and it was okay, I wouldn't abandon it altogether but I've had better and because the menu is so big I would try other dishes first. The cheesecakes are somewhat typical? I ordered the banana cream cheesecake and it was way too sweet for my liking and had more whipping cream than necessary. I've had better cheesecakes from Costco to be quite honest.

There was a counter to the left with 3 people behind it and a podium to the right with 1 person behind it, so i walked over to the podium. I asked if there was a wait time and how long it was. The answer was ""75-90 min with no guarantee"". That threw me off because other than people walking in & out of the mall, the entrance was clear. I asked her where we could leave our name etc. and she answered back ""there is a line up in front of Victoria's Secret"". Glad i asked otherwise there are no signs or anyone directing people that are trying to get in to the restaurant other than Security once someone tries to walk in. FYI at that time, she hadn't bothered to tell me that the line up in front of Victoria's Secret was just a line up that we had to wait in, to come back to her and give our names. That was my biggest issue with the process, not the wait time! It's a mall people. If you can't find something to do with a buzzer in your hand that allows you to go as far as Sporting Life, then that's your issue. We lined up at 12:15pm. It didn't look too bad and moved 3 times in 30 min which got us back to the main podium near the door at 12:45pm. I was given a buzzer and told to come back in 75-90 min. We sat on the benches in front of the Godiva Store with a bunch of other people also waiting for a table. We did some shopping and window shopping to pass the time. Kids had some snacks & their tablets to keep them busy.  Honestly, if it were a stand alone location, there was no chance in he$$ we would've waited even half of that. Thankful for the mall being there and so much to see & do to keep busy. We were finally seated by 2:45pm. Our server (Brittany) was great! She apologized for the wait time after introducing herself. I mentioned our daughter's peanut/nut allergy right after she greeted us. She listened carefully and said she would talk to the kitchen before any of our orders were put through. She took the kids orders and our appetizer order and went to get our drinks. We never had to flag her down or look for her. She was at our table & others frequently and made sure drinks were topped up, empty plates were cleared and ALWAYS asked if we needed anything else and how we were doing and how our meal was. Our order: Hibachi Hanger Steak w/shiitake mushrooms, onions & bean sprouts, wasabi mashed potatoes and tempura battered asparagus. My hubby loved this dish! His steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare. I couldn't try it as i have an allergy to shiitake mushrooms, but he said it was perfectly cooked & seasoned and it was a nice large portion and definitely something he would order again! I ordered the Grilled Steak Tacos - OMG this was super super delish! Honestly, i was looking at the large salads & burgers that i usually have, but decided to try something new. Hands down one of THE best steak tacos i've ever had at a restaurant - ok, other than in Mexico! 4 small tacos filled with perfectly grilled tender steak seasoned so well that i could eat nothing else and be happy! It was topped with chopped avocado, tomatoes, cilantro, crispy onions & chipotle sauce. On the side: a small bowl of black beans & a side of rice.  Our 7 yr old with the peanut/nut allergy wanted macaroni & cheese. Her food was brought out right after our appetizer by another server. She explained that it took a little longer because all the bowls & utensils to make her food were cleaned for her order to ensure no cross contamination or contact with any nut products. I was floored by this. Who does this at restaurants?! AMAZING! My daughter LOVED the macaroni & cheese! Our 4 yr old ordered chicken tenders & fries - 5 lightly battered crispy chicken tender strips. Served with 2 dipping sauces - huge hit! Red Velvet Cheesecake - OMG YUM - just try it! FYI - you can order take out at the counter to the left of the mall entrance. There is a counter with cash register & menus. Wait time is 20-30 min. If you want to order dessert to go, there is a line up at the bakery inside, or you can put an order in through your server when you are ordering your food. It saves time! They don't serve any frozen food - everything is made fresh to order. Would love to see a location at Markville Mall after their current expansion. Or Vaughan Mills. Another location would certainly help the wait times & line ups. We can't wait to go back!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-toronto?start=20,3.44,3.51,3.51,,3.482
190,Jaravm M.,"Mississauga, Canada",6,1,,2.0,2018-09-01,The location was amazing and the restaurant looks great but the biggest problem that this place has is the wait time and the service by far. For me I was not impressed with the food as well. I had ordered a coffee and cheese cake slice and I only received the coffee. I will not be coming back at all. I was so disappointed with this restaurant/ bakery. Oh I should mention that I can receive my bill faster than I can receive my cheese cake.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-toronto?start=60,3.36,3.5,3.5,,3.4440000000000004
213,Bernadette M.,"Toronto, Canada",0,22,,2.0,2018-10-01,"The wait for a table is ridiculous. We waited two hours on a Wednesday evening to be seated and our server told us it was more like a 4-6 hour wait on the weekend. After that kind of wait, you'd think the food and service would knock our socks off but both were merely okay. The service was rather slow actually. I would chalk that up to how busy it was but we had more than two servers covering our table and yet at one point we sat with empty glasses for 20 minutes and no one stopped by to ask if we'd like another drink or how we were doing. From the time we put our name on the list for a table to the time we paid our bill was 4 hours. Save your time and your money. It's not worth it.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-toronto?start=80,3.28,3.48,3.48,,3.4000000000000004
132,Greg F.,"Toronto, Canada",5,74,65.0,3.0,2018-10-01,"My friends and I went to the Cheesecake Factory intending on eating lunch at 3pm but we had to wait 3 hours for a table and ended up eating dinner instead at 6pm.  I ordered the fish tacos and for dessert their classic strawberry cheesecake. The food was delicious and it was a good portion size, but really expensive!! Usually ordering some tacos at any other restaurant wouldn't be more than $15 -- but at the Cheesecake Factory basically every menu item is $20+. Plus the one slice of cheesecake I had for dessert was an extra $10 (ouch). In the end I ended up spending roughly $35 for dinner with tax and tips. The food was definitely good, but not worth the price or the 3 hour wait. I know everyone wants to experience the cheesecake factory for themselves, regardless of the wait times and prices -- so my advice would be to bring a laptop or predownload some shows ahead of time on your phone. You'll thank me later.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-toronto,3.24,3.47,3.47,,3.378
158,Jeremy B.,"Toronto, Canada",108,33,2.0,4.0,2018-10-01,"The burger was very good, and the cheesecake was great (although it was takeout), you can split main meals as they are fairly large. More expensive then the US version of the restaurant. This restaurant is also a lot smaller then the ones in the US, in my opinion this is a feeler store, and they will be opening up a few more restaurants soon in the GTHA.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-toronto?start=40,3.24,3.47,3.47,,3.378
163,Katherine V.,"Toronto, Canada",106,4,1.0,4.0,2018-10-01,"So far I've visited Yorkdale's Cheesecake Factory twice and both visits were pretty great. Their selection of specialty dishes and cheesecakes is so large that it is a little overwhelming when it comes to choosing what to eat, especially for someone as indecisive as myself.  The first time I went, I tried the Chicken Madeira which was recommended by the server and the Tiramisu cheesecake. The Chicken Madeira is supposedly one of the most popular specialty items and it was really good; the chicken was very soft and the mashed potatoes were smooth and creamy. The size of the specialty dishes are very large, however they can be a little pricey (the Chicken Madeira costs $26). Although the portions are large, it may not be quite enough for two people. I shared the Chicken Madeira with a friend, however I think we both have a small appetite and we had plenty of bread with our dish. The Tiramisu cheesecake was very nice and light--would recommend! What's really great about the Cheesecake Factory is its unlimited bread and butter to keep you busy while you wait for your food to arrive. The servers are also pretty good at checking up on you and making sure that you have enough bread and water at all times. The servers I had during both visits were very friendly and attentive.  Although the wait can be quite long, I'd much rather wait 1-2 hours to be seated at the Cheesecake Factory than dine at Pickle Barrel.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-toronto?start=20,3.2,3.47,3.47,,3.362
125,Shaheed S.,"Toronto, Canada",193,266,603.0,4.0,2018-11-01,"Went on a monday night hoping it wont be as busy, and when we walked over to their host booth. They handed us a buzzer and told us 1 hour and 45 minutes and we have to be in a certain vicinity. So we walked around mall and then went down and had some drinks at pickle barrell. About an hour and 15 minutes later the buzzer went off earlier than expected- which we thought was delightful. However the hostess accidentally somehow buzzed everyone on the list and there was a giant queue of confused people. They fixed the error rather quickly and we were told there is another 25 minute wait. So we just kind of stood around the bar and the buzzer went off- but at least i know why they always fighting at cheese cake!! ( please ignore lame attempt to make a drake reference). I tried the stuffed cheeseburger and it was delicious with chedder oozing out the middle and also started off with the spring roll platter that came with a choice of salmon, chicken, avacado and ground beef spring rolls with different dipping sauces. They were all good. Unfortunately i had loaded up on beer while waiting for so long that i had no room for cheesecake at the cheesecake factory. Till next time i guess.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-toronto,3.24,3.48,3.48,,3.384000000000001
130,Shirley L.,"Vancouver, Canada",242,376,359.0,4.0,2018-11-01,"My tip is to think about what time you ideally want to eat, and then start lining up 3 hours earlier. Even if the lineup looks short, you can probably expect to wait at least 2 hours, just given the way their process is set up. The good thing about this location is that it's in a mall, so you can walk around the shop while you wait. However, the buzzer doesn't work if you go too far, so you'll want to stay close to the restaurant when it's close to your estimated time. Other than that, it's a very standard Cheesecake Factory inside. For anyone who hasn't been, that means the same extensive menu (hundreds of options!), same affordable prices, same huge portions, same rich, decadent cheesecake. I would recommend the pasta napoletana - lots of meat (sausage, pepperoni, meatballs), and rich, hearty ingredients and flavours, served with angel hair pasta and a sauce that is both creamy and tomato-y. The chicken madeira is also really good. The chicken breast is not dry at all and is topped with melted cheese for that extra comfort food-vibe and cheesy goodness. I would not recommend the shrimp scampi. It's sauteed shrimp served with angel hair pasta and sounds delicious, but we found it was kind of bland and there wasn't enough sauce, so the noodles were dry. My mom finished her shrimp scampi dish (even though she didn't really like it, so I think the portion size was also smaller than others), but both my dad and I had leftovers to take home from our pasta napoletana and chicken madeira. I think I had about half of my pasta left and he had a third of his chicken left, so it's definitely good value for your money because you'll have meals for the next day! Also the free bread they give you is delicious (the brown one especially), and it is unlimited refills.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-toronto,3.36,3.47,3.47,,3.426
124,Mn T.,"Cachet, Markham, Canada",0,1,2.0,3.0,2018-12-01,"The drinks were good. I had strawberry Martini.  I like it.  The food is OK.  But not amazing.  Waiting 3 hours on weekday for food like that is not worth it.  If I could wait 1 hour,  I might think about it.  The cheese cakes are the worse thing that we had.  Maybe our expectation is a little bit too high.  However,  it only looks good.  The Lemon Meringue is horrible.  It is too sour and not worth 10$ for a slice like that.  My friend had the 30th anniversary cheesecake.  It is too rich that none of us like it.  He couldn't finish it.    My other friend had the fresh strawberry one.  The berries is sweet.  However,  the cake isn't rich enough and way too sweet.  Even though that is original cake with strawberry. The only cheese cake that saved the day is Dulce De Leche. In my opinion, I rather have cheesecake in Costco.  It is good to have experienced it.  but not worth it to come back and wait 3 hours for it",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-toronto,3.44,3.45,3.45,,3.446

122,Michelle O.,"Markham, Canada",3,28,7.0,4.0,2018-12-01,"HOLY SMOKES!  Waited for 4 hours on a Sunday to get seating for 16 people. Overall, I think this place is super overhyped, but that doesn't mean it wasn't amazingly delicious!! I want to start off by saying that the portions are humongous! With my group, we all paired up with someone and ordered 1 main and 1 cheesecake. Prices are quite high but honestly, for the experience, I think it is kind of worth it. Definitely not a restaurant you would go to consistently, but for an amazing treat, I would for sure recommend.  I ordered the Alfredo with Chicken and it was delicious! If i'm being super critical, I would say that the noodles are a bit too al dente and the chicken is a bit dry. Pretty plain meal to be honest, and very expensive.  Had the celebration cheesecake and red velvet cheesecake. Humongous!!! Good ratios with cheesecake, cake and icing.  Had the fried macaroni and cheese as an appetizer and lemme tell u guys. It was 4 small balls. LOL. 4 balls for $20. BUT I GOTTA SAY THOSE WERE SOME SUPER DELICIOUS BALLS GUYS!! Will definitely try to burger topped with fried macaroni and cheese next time.
