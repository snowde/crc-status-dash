Great food, beautiful place and terrific service. It earns  5 stars with me. We came in for brunch on Sunday. I had the lunch portion of the Chinese chicken salad. That was so large!. Crispy lettuce, almonds, grilled chicken, rice noodles and mandarine oranges in a ginger dressing. Tasty. My husband had the bang bang chicken and shrimp( a yummy Thai pasta dish ). For dessert I chose to skip the cheesecake( not an easy thing to to). Instead I opted for a bowl of perfectly ripe strawberries. My husband had the Godiva cheesecake. I took one bite and it tasted like a dark chocolate bar.

326,Stephanie B.,"Severna Park, United States",82,67,31.0,2.0,2012-08-12,"This location is ALWAYS busy. I have never come here and had a wait time of less than 40 minutes. Here are some suggestions if you plan to come here:  A.) Don't come when you're really hungry--You may be driven to cannibalism while you're waiting for a table.  B.) Don't come here without reading material/smart phone gaming/portable movie player/folding chair--Since their ""table pagers"" that they give you will not get a signal beyond 10 feet of their doors, going for a walk around the mall as you wait 3 hours for a table is out of the question. You need to stay entertained somehow. What's the folding chair for? Oh, that's for your you to rest your aching feet. There is ONE (1) long bench that is there in the lobby waiting area (inside) and a couple benches beyond the doors of the mall entrance, and as you can imagine, they fill up quickly. This means, you'll be left with standing for the entire length of time until you get a table assignment which typically takes between 40mins to 1 hr 30 mins for a party of 2-4 people. C.) DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU HAVE A PARTY LARGER THAN FOUR PEOPLE. We made the mistake of coming here with 6 of us one time, and we had a 2 hour wait. They wouldn't even give us a pager until the wait time was at the 1 hour mark, but after waiting 2 hours and 40 minutes, we decided to just hit up P.F. Changs right next door.  Trust me, the quality of service that you'll get isn't typically worth the stress of the long wait times.

DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU HAVE A PARTY LARGER THAN FOUR PEOPLE. We made the mistake of coming here with 6 of us one time, and we had a 2 hour wait. They wouldn't even give us a pager until the wait time was at the 1 hour mark, but after waiting 2 hours and 40 minutes, we decided to just hit up P.F. Changs right next door.  Trust me, the quality of service that you'll get isn't typically worth the stress of the long wait times. I've been here a handfull of times, and each time I am asking myself it it really is worth it. Answer: NO. You're better off ordering the food to-go, and enjoying the meal in the comfort of your home...where there is NO WAIT TIME.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-towson?start=120,2.92,2.92,2.92,3.24,2.92

My favorite item is the Cobb salad. Its enough for two meals. Fresh crisp lettuce with chicken, avocado, egg, cheese and plenty more toppings. I have them toss it with blue cheese dressing since I'm not a fan of other dressings. I also enjoy the mojitos. They have the traditional flavor or you can mix it up with some fruit. I recommend the passion fruit. I'm not very adventurous when it comes to cheesecake flavors so the two slices I've had were good but nothing to brag about.  This place is always packed. So be prepared to wait. To kill time while waiting we decided to walk around the mall and see all the stores Towson town center had to offer.

I have never ordered the same entree twice and everything has always been delicious. On my last visit I ordered a chopped salad from the Skinnylicious menu which was excellent. It had a delicious dressing, grilled chicken, bacon, avocado, corn, tomatoes, etc. The portion size was perfect; about half the size of one ordered from the standard menu. Those salads are huge. I can never finish them and I think leftover salads are just gross, so i liked this better. If you order any entrees from the standard menu prepare to have leftovers. Of course the cheesecakes here are fantastic, too. My favorite is the Pineapple Upside Down cake. I have also had the Hershey's chocolate cheesecake and the Red Velvet.

That would have been expected at the minimum; however, no one else at the table would eat the food out of the kitchen.

276,K W.,"Baltimore, United States",0,1,,2.0,2016-02-12,"I love this place. Everyone knows that the food and atmosphere is good. However, I love the idea of the curbside pickup - when it works... the management should look at improving the customer service around curbside pickup. I keep trying to do curbside pickup - about once a week. It starts with the phone call. I typically call my order in when I'm about a half an hour away from the restaurant. However every time I call, I am put on hold. Most of the time, I'm on hold for an indefinite amount of time. Yesterday I waited for five minutes on hold until I hung up. I called back again and was put on hold for another 10 minutes. This is valuable time since I was driving to the restaurant and I needed that time for the food to be prepared, so the food would be ready when I got there. What needs to happen, is management needs to implement warm transfers. I was waiting to be transferred to the bakery so someone can at least place my order, but I couldn't even get my order placed because I was still on hold. So I called back and I talked to the lady who answered the phone and asked them to do a warm transfer over to the bakery. This means that someone would stay on the phone call and ensure that my transfer from one real human being to another real human being occurs. Instead the woman who answered the phone, Rachel, said that I just had to wait on hold and someone will answer when they get to me. It was a poor customer service experience for such a good restaurant.  Although I enjoy the restaurant, I probably won't do curbside anymore.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-towson?start=80,3.16,3.23,3.23,2.8880000000000003,3.202

62,K W.,"Baltimore, MD",0,1,,2.0,2016-12-02,"I love this place. Everyone knows that the food and atmosphere is good. However, I love the idea of the curbside pickup - when it works... the management should look at improving the customer service around curbside pickup. I keep trying to do curbside pickup - about once a week. It starts with the phone call. I typically call my order in when I'm about a half an hour away from the restaurant. However every time I call, I am put on hold. Most of the time, I'm on hold for an indefinite amount of time. Yesterday I waited for five minutes on hold until I hung up. I called back again and was put on hold for another 10 minutes. This is valuable time since I was driving to the restaurant and I needed that time for the food to be prepared, so the food would be ready when I got there. What needs to happen, is management needs to implement warm transfers. I was waiting to be transferred to the bakery so someone can at least place my order, but I couldn't even get my order placed because I was still on hold. So I called back and I talked to the lady who answered the phone and asked them to do a warm transfer over to the bakery. This means that someone would stay on the phone call and ensure that my transfer from one real human being to another real human being occurs. Instead the woman who answered the phone, Rachel, said that I just had to wait on hold and someone will answer when they get to me. It was a poor customer service experience for such a good restaurant.  Although I enjoy the restaurant, I probably won't do curbside anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-towson?start=80,3.36,3.2,3.304,2.6320000000000006,3.2640000000000007

However, I must dissect this Towson location and even comment on a few issues controlled by corporate. The location is nice and most importantly clean. However, I don't understand the decor. It's quite confusing and kinda reminds me of an Indian restaurant. The food prices are not super pricey, but certainly not the most affordable. The food came hot 25 minutes after ordering but the portions seemed skimpy. I like most people love cheesecake so I obviously ordered a slice. To be honest, I expected to be in cheesecake heaven. I thought I'd have my life flash before my eyes after biting into what's supposed to be the best cheesecake on earth. But that wasn't the case. It's a middle of the road cheesecake that extremely overpriced. I guess that's why when you look around the restaurant you don't see many people actually ordering it.

196,Whitley D.,"Churchville, United States",160,151,1763.0,3.0,2017-10-18,I love the Cheesecake Factory from the presentation of the restaurant to the wonderful food. Yes even though I love Cheesecake Factory this location has let me down twice. Since they don't offer reservations I have set up two parties at this location (meaning showed up 2 hours before the event) and they have always had an excuse when it's time for the area I waited for being available. So that's been a let down. The manager the second time comped some appetizers on the house but my guest were starving from the wait so many people were upset.  The food at this location is delicious! I have only experienced one issue before and it wasn't their fault. The service to get our food was average which was disappointing. The waitress we had wasn't the most personable person but we were all still nice with her. The appetizers came at a decent rate but our main entrees were all coming out at all different times. That was disappointing for the simple fact everyone was starving! Even though the food wasn't all on point one thing that truly was were the drinks! I ordered three and they were all pleasant!  Hopefully this location can get it together to get the 5 stars I know them to be!!,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-towson,3.2,3.22,3.26,,3.2120000000000006

We went in for Saturday Sunday brunch (10-2pm) and my friend got Green Chilaquiles with Carnitas and Egg and I got the Fried Chicken and Waffles Benedict. Chicken was perfect, moist on the inside and with tasty batter on the outside, and went with the waffles well. My friend really liked the Chilaquiles. Server seemed rushed even though the restaurant was less than half full, but was quick to get anything forgotten like side of syrup or drinks.  The food was so satisfying neither of us could fit dessert at the end, but the cheesecake there is amazing, so we ordered two slices to go for when we weren't as stuffed. I was disappointed in how bland the white chocolate peppermint bark cheesecake was, didn't taste like much besides a lot of crunchy minty bits where's the cheesecake? but the reason I tried a new flavor is because I love so many of TCF's flavors! I admit I usually just go for cheesecake and not a whole meal, and then the Lemon Raspberry Cream or Chocolate Mousse cheesecakes are wonderful favorites. I took a chance on the Vanilla Bean cheesecake (too many places think vanilla means tasteless) and really enjoyed it, definite vanilla flavor and the crust, mousse, and cheesecake were all distinct and great together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-towson,3.24,3.1,3.272,,3.1560000000000006
