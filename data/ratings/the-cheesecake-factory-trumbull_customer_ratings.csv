64,Corinne C.,"Hamden, United States",7,17,16.0,2.0,2014-01-12,"The food was great and plentiful. Service was friendly, but sooooooo incredibly slow. 25 minutes after ordering before the first kid's drink arrive. 10 more minutes before the next 2 were delivered. (If you're a mom, you know this is not Ok...) We preordered the birthday cheesecake earlier in the day so it would be ready after dinner. We finished dinner, requested our cakes, and it took an additional 40 minutes before they brought the cakes out for us to sing happy birthday. It was unsliced, so they brought it back to the kitchen and 10 minutes later we were final having dessert.  This was on a Monday night. I can't fathom how bad it is on the weekend. I know lots of people enjoy The Cheescake Factory, but it's just not for me. Give yourself at least 2.5-3 hours if you plan to eat here.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-trumbull?start=80,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003

Place was mobbed but they still brought out our good timely and everything was great especially the pear arugula and blue cheese flatbread yum!!!Only complaint was the roast chicken was overlooked and dry. It is a packed Friday night. They they brought the whole table desserts and sincerely apologized. That's great service and we will be back here many times in the near future.  Laura our server was really great. Very attentive, very nice and well informed.

Then they took our order (for two people) and we waited another hour and no food or updates. The people who got there after us got their food before us. I dont know how they expect to have a menu thats 15 pages long (thats an exaggeration but still) and stay in business.

We look forward to our next visits individually & together.  Side Note to Corporation: ONE suggestion to The Cheesecake Factory Corp, while I know they don't currently take ANY reservations, at ANY OF THEIR LOCATIONS, they SHOULD REALLY CONSIDER accepting reservations for larger groups, at ALL locations. (Or at the very least do a ""trial period"" of this concept at select spots and see what sort of response they get from both customers, employees,  & sales). They could call, email, and/or text also, to confirm the details, so as to avoid no shows etc. I think this would encourage more business for them & happy customers overall.

135,Joseph L.,"Fairfield, United States",53,98,169.0,4.0,2014-08-20,"Keeping in mind that this location is brand new and just opened up for less than a month, they're still working out some kinks.  I've always been a big Cheesecake Factory fan, which is why I wasn't surprised that this place was completely packed Sunday night.  If you are going in with a party of 2 it shouldn't be too bad, my wife and I waited for about 30 minutes but I like the fact that they have text message system rather than the little vibrating sensors that let you know your table's ready.  It allows you to go further away from the restaurant and shop the mall while you wait and not miss the alert.  Bigger parties, you'll probably be waiting an hour or more depending on what time you go.   After reading the few reviews posted so far I was trying to keep my expectations in check and not being over hyped.  We had 2 waitresses attending our table which was great, probably 1 in training.  Joclyn was very professional and attentive.  We got our drinks and bread quickly and the bread was very fresh and still warm. We ordered the Fire Cracker Salmon Rolls for appetizer which came out at a reasonable pace.  For entrees we had 2 different pastas, both arrived at the same time and still very hot and fresh.  I was also surprised that they were seasoned very well and portion size was excellent as usual with Cheesecake Factory.   I couldn't say the same for the table next to us, they had some issues with their order (too much cheese on their pizza... wth?)  Anyway, we also got the banana cream cheese cake which was very smooth and delish.  Overall, we had an excellent experience this time and I hope it'll continue the next time we return.  I was happy with the service we received from Joclyn and no complaints about the food despite the other reviews and our neighboring table.   There can be room for improvement at the entrance as it gets pretty crazy crowded during times and confusion occurs as some people picking up take out or just buying cheese cake get all mingled with the other restaurant guests waiting for tables. The front end people seemed kind of stressed as they don't really smile or act alert when guests try to get their attention, but I assume their just really trying to focus on seating everyone.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-trumbull?start=140,2.384,2.384,2.384,2.384,2.384

Second, besides the 1 1/2 we waited to get seated we had to wait almost another 45 minutes before the main course came out. We went in for lunch around 1 and did not start to eat till after 3pm. At this point we were starving. Here is the kicker. Despite our best efforts to tell the wait staff that we had a birthday person at the table, of everyone's main course, they bought her's out cold!! Needless to say we were not a happy bunch. The waitress did her best to apologize and the manager comp'd her meal but that was not the point. They ruined what was supposed to be a memorable occasion. Her 21st birthday.  Some of us lost our appetite because everyone mood changed. For the worse.

248,Robert K.,"Milford, CT",206,369,22.0,1.0,2015-01-12,"Seemingly in an effort to maximize square footage and maximize every last cent of revenue, this Cheesecake Factory location installed an ""outdoor"" patio, complete with wicker dining furniture, umbrellas, and faux plant life. The catch? It's not outside. It's in the mall causeway.  Nothing like the smells and sounds of bustling suburban retail along with the bright antiseptic glow of fluorescent lighting to accompany a fine meal.  They've really redefined ""al fresco"". How progressive. We came to Cheesecake Factory to spend a gift card. My memories of Cheesecake Factory were mostly on the positive side. A large, mostly competent menu of items at a slightly higher quality level than Applebee's or Chili's, in a space slightly more adorned with high ceilings and a templatized attempted at ornate.  But that's just it. This is faux fine dining, just as the patio was faux outdoor dining. It's all a ruse until you eat the food. And I guess the average mall goer that stumbles in here leaves impressed, at least judging by the long waits. But maybe it's just the effect of marketing, decor, the illusion of ""fancy"". The sad thing is, for the prices you pay here you can eat at a much more competent, honest, locally owned restaurant. The food and service will likely be better, and you'll be supporting a local business. But while much better local restaurants struggle on a Sunday night, this place was booming.  When we asked to be moved from the stale air of the then-closed mall corridor, the staff seemed annoyed. But here's the thing: it's customary to ask if you have a preference between outdoor and indoor before being seated, even if the outdoor space is fake. Service was satisfactory, but did not match the formal attire that servers don.  The food was very disappointing all around. The allegedly spicy Louisiana Chicken Pasta was bland, with dry breaded chicken. The Chicken Enchiladas tasted nothing like Mexican food, almost as if they were topped with canned tomato sauce with a sickly sweet taste we couldn't place. Everything tasted clearly reheated, further proven by the too-hot-to-touch plate of the enchiladas. These taste like frozen microwave entrees, in huge portions, carefully plated. The menu tries to be everything for everyone with hundreds of items, serving the ""Factory"" moniker well, but one must wonder how much of it is successful.  The cheesecake with strawberries was the one positive, but our enthusiasm waned when we realized the center was frozen. And that dinner perfectly sums up the proposition of Cheesecake Factory. It's all presentation, and from a financial standpoint, it works.  You just have to wonder from the fake patio and frozen cheesecake whether they care that we can now see the strings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-trumbull?start=40,1.64,1.64,1.64,2.468,1.6400000000000001

Afterwards, no one acknowledged us for almost 15 minutes since we sat down.  While we were waiting for the waiter to come I was already getting frustrated with the fact that there were so many servers passing by and not 1 could say ""someone will be right with you"". We should have left right then and there. Anyways, once our server did come, which I don't even know his name because he never introduced himself, he asked what we wanted to drink. We placed our drink orders and an appetizer, since we were still deciding on the main course.  Long story short, we waited almost 15 minutes to get our drinks alone, and I had to ask for some bread for the table since we were starving. Once our server left the table he literally stood around and chatted with co workers instead of getting our drinks.  Then the appetizer arrived which was delivered by another server, and I had to ask that guy for my glass of water which OUR SERVER forgot. About 15 minutes later our  server came by to check on us and I told him we were ready to order our main course, but he took FOREVER to put the order in the computer. We saw him stand around and talk with co workers AGAIN instead of putting our food order in. SERIOUSLY!?  We literally waited another 20 minutes for our main dishes.  Once we were done eating, we wanted to bring a piece of cheesecake home and get the bill. Again the waiter was ignoring us or just simply forgot to check on us, and kept walking by. Once he did come back to our table we waited another 30 MINUTES to get the check and piece of cheesecake to go! That's ridiculous!!! I wanted to just get up and leave already but we were waiting for the change.  I understand it was busy but 2 other tables sat around us and they were helped immediately and received their drinks and checks before us! What kind of s*** is that!? I was getting really ticked off, to the point where I just wanted to get up and leave.  As far as the food, it was okay.. Nothing special. Definitely won't be returning unless they fix their service and staff. Hostess was rude and asked me with an attitude to move my dirty dishes from the table next to us so she can seat a party. UM HELLO LADY WE PUT OUR PLATES THERE BECAUSE NO ONE CAME AND REMOVED THEM FROM THE TABLE SO WE HAD NO ROOM TO EAT!  That was my experience at the Cheesecake Factory in the Trumbull Mall.

10,Robert K.,"Milford, United States",206,367,22.0,1.0,2015-12-01,"Seemingly in an effort to maximize square footage and maximize every last cent of revenue, this Cheesecake Factory location installed an ""outdoor"" patio, complete with wicker dining furniture, umbrellas, and faux plant life. The catch? It's not outside. It's in the mall causeway.  Nothing like the smells and sounds of bustling suburban retail along with the bright antiseptic glow of fluorescent lighting to accompany a fine meal.  They've really redefined ""al fresco"". How progressive. We came to Cheesecake Factory to spend a gift card. My memories of Cheesecake Factory were mostly on the positive side. A large, mostly competent menu of items at a slightly higher quality level than Applebee's or Chili's, in a space slightly more adorned with high ceilings and a templatized attempted at ornate.  But that's just it. This is faux fine dining, just as the patio was faux outdoor dining. It's all a ruse until you eat the food. And I guess the average mall goer that stumbles in here leaves impressed, at least judging by the long waits. But maybe it's just the effect of marketing, decor, the illusion of ""fancy"". The sad thing is, for the prices you pay here you can eat at a much more competent, honest, locally owned restaurant. The food and service will likely be better, and you'll be supporting a local business. But while much better local restaurants struggle on a Sunday night, this place was booming.  When we asked to be moved from the stale air of the then-closed mall corridor, the staff seemed annoyed. But here's the thing: it's customary to ask if you have a preference between outdoor and indoor before being seated, even if the outdoor space is fake. Service was satisfactory, but did not match the formal attire that servers don.  The food was very disappointing all around. The allegedly spicy Louisiana Chicken Pasta was bland, with dry breaded chicken. The Chicken Enchiladas tasted nothing like Mexican food, almost as if they were topped with canned tomato sauce with a sickly sweet taste we couldn't place. Everything tasted clearly reheated, further proven by the too-hot-to-touch plate of the enchiladas. These taste like frozen microwave entrees, in huge portions, carefully plated. The menu tries to be everything for everyone with hundreds of items, serving the ""Factory"" moniker well, but one must wonder how much of it is successful.  The cheesecake with strawberries was the one positive, but our enthusiasm waned when we realized the center was frozen. And that dinner perfectly sums up the proposition of Cheesecake Factory. It's all presentation, and from a financial standpoint, it works.  You just have to wonder from the fake patio and frozen cheesecake whether they care that we can now see the strings.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-trumbull?start=40,3.28,2.9,2.9,2.9160000000000004,3.052

There is very ample and very comfortable seating inside as well as a small outdoor patio dining area which is nice. The décor and the overall ambiance gives this place an upscale feel and the entire staff is friendly and attentive. But while the place has an upscale look and vibe, it is really just your average chain restaurant with good PR. However, that good PR makes their prices a bit steeper than places like an Applebee's or Ruby Tuesday's. The appetizers here average around $10.50 and the main dishes around $19.00. For two people each ordering an appetizer, main dish, beverage and one dessert to split, you can easily drop $60-$75 per person before the tip. If you order alcohol, jack that price up much higher. As for the food itself. Let's start with the menu. It is 20 pages long! You have so much to choose from the decision is staggering. I have been there half a dozen times and tried something different each time. At that rate it may well take a few hundred visits to put even a dent in the menu. Whatever you're in the mood for, you can find something here. The quality of the food is good to very good. The preparation and presentation are excellent. The portions are a bit on the smallish side compared to other chains, especially when you consider the price, but they are still enough to enjoy adequately, though you will have room for dessert (that may be the point). Some negatives, if you go at peak days/times, you might have quite a wait, it could be an hour. I have only had a wait on one trip, it was 25 minutes. Another inconsistency is the prep time to get your meal. I have had a meal arrive anywhere from 15 minutes to over 35 minutes from the time of ordering, and it did not seem to matter if the place was busy or not with the longer waits. Now let's get to the part where this place simply shines; the desserts! As their name implies, this place has the most amazing and decadent selection of cheesecakes you can possibly imagine, and then some. A full three pages of the menu is dedicated to their cheesecakes, specialty desserts, specialty coffees, iced and frozen drinks ice cream creations and shakes.

You can also buy whole cheesecakes from their display cases. The dessert portions are generous too. One piece of cheesecake is more than enough for one person, and can be split between two and still give each of you enough to enjoy. I love cheesecake in general and this place makes them an art. I have had theirs on three of my trips, though I am not normally one for dessert. Bottom line is the food is on average, very good, the portions a bit smallish, but if you include dessert, you will not leave hungry.

The food is great and portioned just enough to have a significant meal. While it can be a bit pricey, it is still great food and drinks. My only concern would be there is no wifi and apple pay. Interesting that there can be such a great place that is behind with technology.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-trumbull,2.6,2.74,2.968,,2.684

199,Eamonn S.,"Queens, NY",6,115,,1.0,2017-12-05,"Not the worst meal I have had in awhile, but definately the most overpriced bad meal I have eaten in a long time. The place itself is nice enough. Big, bright and slightly chaotic. The bartender was attentive...now to the food/drinks... My first mistake was ordering an actual drink that exists in the real world. An old fashioned arrived and it was the size of a gatorade. Obviously watered down ruining the essence of the cocktail. The taquitos and samosas were fine...but literally tasted like premade frozen apps dropped into a deep fryer. The entree was atrocious. Pasta Napoletana was a tomatoes sauce inexplicably over a bed of what I could only decribe as alfredo? It was like taking an overly rich, creamy slime covered in the sauce for a different dish entirely.

I open the container and there are three TINY bite size pieces of chicken- not chicken breast mind you but nugget sized pieces. 3 in a chicken pot pie, surely there must be a mistake. Grubhub calls them and they say nope we aren't refunding it, not our fault. This is beyond disappointing to me, if i order a meal i expect to have it properly made and to treat your customers with dignity and to apologize for the mishap.
