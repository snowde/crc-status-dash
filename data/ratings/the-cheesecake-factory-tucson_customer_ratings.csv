220,Ricky V.,"Tucson, AZ",349,221,18.0,4.0,2012-01-06,"The large part of my experiences with TCF is with larger groups and time and again I am impressed. When you got 10-18 people looking for a place to eat its amazing that this place is adaptable to accommodation. This time I had a great pasta that was properly oiled and graced with proportionate amounts of tomatoes, herbs, and feta cheese that was just a great meal.  We also had those fried zucchini sticks with the mozzarella atop. but it was obviously from a prepared and refrigerated mix, since it melted far to slow. Hand grinding is usually thinner imparts some warmth and melts faster. That's how i know. The drinks came out in good time, or waters were always filled, and the waitress was very nice even though we continue to invite our difficult friend. He makes for laughs and assures me that our hosts ""earn"" their keep. He's not mean, he is challenging.  Anyways while the huge menu, and service are very good there are things that keep the restaurant from reaching the top echelon. Perhaps a higher end selection or more paired items. I think a menu revamp should be in order. Surprisingly this has a lot of  sub conscious behavioral affects on people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tucson?start=200,3.04,3.04,3.04,3.088,3.0400000000000005
175,Chris F.,"Tucson, AZ",20,9,,3.0,2012-01-26,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory for the first time last night, and the same thought keeps running through my head, ""So this is what I could have been experiencing since 1996?"". I can't say I was disappointed, but I think I was underwhelmed by my meal. Upon arrival, we were seated right away, which was a big plus with a baby in tow. The waitress, Josie, was cheerful and attentive throughout the evening, and my Diet Coke was constantly full. No complaints there. The place was dimly lit and fairly loud. Again, not a real problem with a tired (screaming at times) baby. I could see it being a nice place for high school student on their way to homecoming. The menu...oh, the menu, where to begin? It's large. So, if you're looking for a place to feed people with differing tastes, you'll surely be able to please everyone. My problem was indecision. So, I end up reading the whole menu, and circling back to something I consider safe: burger and fries. The fries were, I must admit, standard yet tasty. Just the right amount of salt. The burger did not live up to the potential that bacon, cheddar, BBQ sauce, and onion rings could deliver. Everything felt close to nice fast food than something costing more than twice as much. Don't get me wrong, this food wasn't about to make me sick, but it did make me long for the Vietnamese tacos sitting across the table from me. (and the crab cake sandwich I foolishly passed up) Still, I forged on. This was, after all, the factory of cake and cheese!! Dessert was not to be passed up. We went with the Key Lime Cheesecake. It came out looking wonderful. Soft whipped cream topped the plate in just the right proportion. But, when my fork hit the cake and it wobbled like rubber, I was shocked. The consistency of the cheesecake left a lot to be desired. The taste, however, was delightfully tangy and satisfying. In the end, I left full (stuffed even), but left confident that other options would not cause me to object to a return visit. However, I knew that I would not return for any of the things I'd just eaten.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tucson?start=160,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.9880000000000004,3.0000000000000004

211,Kyle H.,"Tucson, AZ",1,5,,2.0,2012-01-29,"What an interesting place.... The menu is HUGE as is the footprint of the establishment. Honestly I feel like most people are in awe of the faux grandeur of the decor. Anyway on a very nice Saturday evening my girlfriend and I were sat within a minute of arriving. This always seems to be the case w/ TCF, which is a positive because at least you have your own space to wait long periods of time before you actually interact with someone that will take your drink order (then 10 minutes later your food order). The service just seemed to be slow and uncoordinated. Food wise: The size of the menu basically says 'we don't do anything really well but we'll make anything you want and do it adequately'. As always being the adventurous  one I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich w/ fries. The girlfriend ordered Mexican inspired fish tacos. Lets get down and dirty: the fries were pretty damn good, the sandwich was fair (for the price I expected it to be better than Chick-a-Fil, but it wasn't) and my soda was mixed very well. During the course of eating I asked my lady how she liked her tacos and asked her if they were better than Rubio's (the fast food joint) and surprisingly she said no.  Now I know I'm comparing fast food to a supposedly luxurious sit down establishment but my point is that when you don't specialize you fail. It's hard to do one thing beautifully let alone 60+ dishes. My take: this place is great for larger groups because the menu is large enough that anyone can find something they like on it. But if you're going with just one other individual be wise in your decision and be ready for an average meal at an extraordinary price.  Disclaimer: I've had the cheesecake during previous visits and it's been great but the dessert doesn't make the meal or the experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tucson?start=180,2.96,2.96,2.96,2.8880000000000003,2.96

And black people are usually really late, but we were on time. they finally get us seated after 45 mins. The lemonade i had was very sugary it must have been 3/4ths sugar :/ I ordered the Steak Diane (because of the name hehe) it was good i enjoyed that. But we were  there celebrating a birthday party and they separated the tables between two servers, our table got the worst one. We had to ask multiple times for bread and she took forever. Then when the party planner said it was a birthday and asked if they had anything special the waitress brought out cheesecake but she forgot to tell us that wed be charged for it. She had no problem telling us the lemonade didn't have free refills but forgot to tell us the cheesecake was going to cost. which she then told us that if everyone with a birthday got a free slice of cake then they wouldn't have any -__- okay we had no problem with paying but you should have told us. So the girl talked to the manager about it. then the waitress who so idiotically decided to throw snarky remarks our way in earshot to a coworker. Grow up its your job and you're going to get called out on it if you mess up, not only mess up but have an attitude about it.

232,Yvett R.,"Portland, OR",267,473,170.0,3.0,2012-03-18,"First off, don't judge me for going to a chain. We were on that side of town, we'd never been to ANY Cheesecake Factory and figured it wouldn't hurt.  I don't know if the decor is the same at each location (like Olive Garden), so I have to admit that it's certainly pretty. I also really like a place that has their staff wear bright white. White = clean in my mind, so that's always a plus. We went on a busy Friday evening but it look less than 10 minutes to be seated. In that short while, we were offered a seat at the bar so that we wouldn't have to wait at all.  The service was fast and friendly. I have to admit that I was overwhelmed by their menu. Our go-to restaurants have a one page menu (food in the front, drinks in the back), so a 21 page menu can be a lot to process. I ordered a Cuban sandwich with sweet potato fries, my husband had a beet & goat cheese salad and a flatbread of some kind. The food was out pretty quickly and it was just ""eh"". It wasn't terrible, it wasn't fantastic, it was just adequate. Nothing memorable. Nothing I'm going to be craving. Nothing I'm going to tripping over to try again soon. Eh. My husband was disappointed that the beets weren't fresh. I only ate about a quarter of my sandwich and had the rest boxed up.  Of course we tried the cheesecake. We had a Hershey's one to share. Again, it was good but not the best cheesecake I've had in my life. I was a bit sad about that because I was somehow expecting a spectacular cheesecake. It was sweet and rich and chocolaty but again, not something I can't live without.  I'd give a glowing review for the staff and waiter and an ""eh"" review for the food. I'd go again if I was meeting someone there, but I don't think I'd suggest this as a place to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tucson?start=200,2.92,2.92,2.92,3.0200000000000005,2.92

With strawberry drizzle and real strawberries it is mouthwatering. The other slices of cake they offer are HUGE and good too (I hear).  My burger, pizza, salad, and shrimp have always been cooked very well and do not disappoint. My only dish that I have to say I didn't think much of was the broccoli cheddar soup. :( I was very sad as that is one of my favorite's soups. Everything else is great though.

91,Jennifer P.,"La Grange, IL",0,3,,1.0,2012-08-11,I am writing about the horrific experience I just had at the Tucson cheesecake factory.  To start the evening we were informed there were no ribeye steaks after we had ordered.  That was the least disturbing part of the evening.  Our appetizers arrives and the wrong dressing was mixed on our salad-still tolerable.  While waiting for our entrees the bar area where we were seated slowly became the place to hang out for all the under age college kids-most of which were beyond intoxicated and clearly not of age.  There was a steady parade people to and from the outside seating area which unfortunately the door Was located next to our table.  Several girls were allowed to parade in and out without shoes...BAREFOOT!! They were allowed to sit at the bar tables BAREFOOT!!  I have always thought of the cheesecake factory as a higher class restaurant than what I witnessed tonight.  As a young physician just the health code violations were astonishing to me.  The Service was subpar and the intoxicated underage college students inappropriately dressed for even the lowest quality establishment was unacceptable.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tucson?start=220,3.08,3.08,3.08,2.8520000000000003,3.0800000000000005
55,Jessie B.,"Henderson, NV",75,776,124.0,4.0,2012-09-19,"I met a girlfriend and her daughter at The Cheesecake Factory for lunch. We were celebrating the friend's birthday... Our waiter was really friendly, and reminded us of Ross from Friends both in terms of personality and apperance. My friend's daughter had a lot of questions about the menu and he was very patient with her. Ended up customizing a meal for her based on what she wanted, and brought out special sauces for her to try until she remembered which she liked best. We started out with some delicious drinks, and decided to split a couple appetizers from the super cool skinnylicious menu. For those that are unfamiliar with how The Cheesecake Factory rolls, the typical portions are HUGE and very high calorie. I learned a while ago that I can noteat one of the normal entrees if I have any desire to get a piece of cheesecake (and really, why would you go to the CHEESECAKE Factory and NOT get a piece?!) The three apps we shared were: Avocado Eggrolls - Not a Skinnylicious item but honestly...  I can't remember the last time I went to The Cheesecake Factory and didn't order these. My tried and true favorite, love the creamy and crunchy texture.  Crispy Crab Bites - Skinnylicious! Perfectly cooked, perfectly sized. Would order again. Chicken Lettuce Wrap Tacos - Also Skinnylicious, and they have three types.. We had the Mediterranean style which came with feta cheese, kalamata olives and tzatziki sauce. My least favorite of the apps we ordered but they were still good.  Sadly, I ended up eating too much to get cheesecake, despite my efforts not to. BOO! Since we were celebrating a birthday, 'Ross' our waiter brought out a minmi desert for the birthday lady, on the house, and he also got his coworkers to sing and embarass my friend.

They've got HUGE portions (a half-size salad is still a towering pile of greens), but you can easily have an appetizer for a meal, which helps with price. I love the chicken lettuce wraps (an appetizer). They're also great for Happy Hour! $2 beers - even the ""imports"" is an excellent price! Plus they have a number of full-size appetizers for $5. Again - they're big enough for an entire meal so you can eat dinner for $5, have a couple $2 drinks and STILL have the total bill under 10 bucks!

57,Kelly W.,"Tucson, AZ",11,81,130.0,4.0,2012-12-07,"We walked in on a Sunday evening and waited about 10 minutes for a table. Zacariah, our server, was excellent: polite, friendly and efficient. My friend had the Four Cheese Pasta with chicken and I had the Veggie Burger. All food was fresh and brought promptly. Both dishes were delicious.  I was concerned that the Veggie Burger had beets mixed into it as I don't like beets but I couldn't taste them at all. Veggie burgers are always a bit of a gamble as sometimes the taste or texture can be poor, but this one was delicious, a tad bit on the sweet side. Kind of a mushy texture but not bad. For dessert we shared a slice of Chocolate Raspberry Truffle cheesecake. It was out of this world. This is cheesecake at its supreme best. It couldn't be any better. Lighting and ambiance were very nice, conducive to a leisurely, enjoyable dinner.  Even though business in the restaurant was brisk we did not feel rushed. My only complaint is that the glasses our drinks came in were a little sticky around the rim as if they hadn't been washed well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tucson?start=140,3.16,3.16,3.16,3.3440000000000003,3.1600000000000006
250,Joe K.,"Tucson, AZ",0,5,5.0,5.0,2012-12-28,"Wow!  Tonight the food was really exceptional!  I have been here several times over the past few years and most of the time it is a 3.5 to 4, not bad, but not over the top either. But I am really happy to say tonight they really did a fantastic job not only on my meal, but my wife, mother and kids meals. I had to first off assess if it was perception because I was hungry or was it the food and service that were really good, I wasn't starving or anything, but was looking forward to a good meal with the family. First off, I think this is the first time I have tried the Clam Chowder they serve on Friday's.  I consider myself pretty much a snob in the area of New England Clam chowder and have had some of the best over on the coast in New England's land of seafood.  This was really outstanding.  It had the right balance of potatoes, cream, butter and very good tasting clams.  I tend to really rate a chowder by it having a lot of clams, and this has a lot.  It was just wonderful. I did ask if it was made there and was told they do make it fresh. The only item for improvement was I like a few crackers, either oyster or even some regular square, but they don't have any, and even the waiter said he didn't understand it either, but he brought some more bread and all was well.  Still invest in a few crackers, sounded like others are asking for them as well. Next was the Classic Burger I ordered.  I am very picky about getting medium or medium rare with my beef, and this was perfect.  Warm pink center, and light and crispy on the outside, and very juicy inside, but not elbow drenching over the top juiciness. It was solid, beefy and the bread was toasted and the red onion patty was grilled just right.  Whoever was working the grill did an outstanding job.  They call it a chophouse burger, so I assume this means a chopped steak like sirloin or something. The secret to a juicy burger is using fatty burger or ground steak, and this was it.  It was really great, and it came along with a herb mayonnaise sauce that was really tasty. Everyone at the table had a small wedge of it and all said superb. It was arguably the best burger I have had in a long time. I think the one that comes close to it is Zinburger over on East River Road, great burger there too. Only improvement is choice of potatoes, it would be a nice menu add if they do a nice crispy baked potato, but they only offer mashed and fries, but that isn't why I ordered the burger.  The burger stood on its own very well. Lastly, we ordered cheese cake, and this is the first time I have ordered the Fresh Banana Cheesecake, it was simply wonderful.  I have an affection for cream and bananas, so I am biased in this area, but this was well balanced, well chilled cheesecake and the bananas were clearly fresh.  All blended and tasted smooth and complementary. Lastly was the service, we had several people bring food and asking if we needed things, and they followed up correctly.  The main waitress was Alina.  She was engaging, helpful, full of energy and made sure our drinks were kept full and knowledgeable when I asked questions about the food.  Great service.  I also liked the fact that they brought the various courses are the right times and we weren't rushed with the main course coming when we were only half way through the first soups and salads.   Definitely going back.  BTW, this was a Friday evening, so I am wondering if they don't staff all areas with the more veteran and seasoned staff, but I know I haven't always been there on a busy Friday evening.   My families meals of spaghetti, and broccolini pasta and sausage meals were really great too, everyone was very happy when we left with out meals and doggy bags! Final thing, it would be nice if you had wifi, there was conversation going on and we all wanted to check something online to add to our conversation, but nothing.  or get a cell booster installed, because you can't get a cell signal in there at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tucson?start=240,3.2,3.2,3.2,3.4760000000000004,3.2000000000000006
107,Kathy N.,"Tucson, AZ",235,375,643.0,4.0,2013-02-04,"Alcohol and cheesecake, the perfect remedy for a sucky day for four hard working executive assistants, right? My girls and I came here tonight to celebrate a birthday among us and to catch up on each other's lives.  I've been to this Cheesecake Factory three times now and it gets better with each visit. I arrived first tonight and waited in the roomy and open waiting area. The seating is pretty much blocked from the hostess area view and while it got a little busy with evening diners, it was comforting to know I wasn't forgotten sitting there by myself. Two different hostesses checked on me during the 10 minute wait before my friends showed. Cocktails were in order and once seated and bread and water (didn't even have to ask for water!) were put on the table, we placed our drink orders. I prefer tequila over any other spirit but hate that typical tequila drinks are either some version of a margarita or some sickeningly sweet concoction. The Firefly surprised me with its pleasant but not too sweet taste.  Silver tequila with passion fruit, blood orange and a little splash of Prosecco. A pretty little garnish of an orange peel curl topped my drink. Just a sip or two and I was in my happy place. Two girls ordered Little House Salads to go with their meals and they looked like average salads with a nice mixture of greens. The ""Little"" salads were very generously portioned. The Shrimp with Angel Hair was full of plump shrimp and substituting penne for the angel hair was no problem.  Dynamite Shrimp was a hit and devoured quickly. One friend ordered the Mexican Chicken Lettuce Wrapped Tacos and they were much larger than she thought they'd be. Pretty sure she enjoyed them. I went with the Chicken Madeira and it was delicious. Extremely tender chicken breast filets topped with gooey, melted mozzarella, asparagus and mushrooms along with a light Madeira sauce. Served with mashed potatoes made it a super comfort food to appease the craptastic day I'd had. We shared a slice of Dulce de Leche cheesecake and the caramel, fluffy tanginess was an explosion of flavor in my mouth. Our server brought out a little ice cream sundae after she heard us talking about a birthday and she readily obliged us by NOT gathering her fellow wait staff to sing to and embarrass my friend. Prices are a little high in my opinion but like I said, this is my third visit so I guess the price isn't out of my comfort zone.

The top of the list is the Navajo. I love Native American fry bread (who doesn't love fried bread?), however, it's harder to find. Here they turn it into a sandwich with moist chicken and some yummy sauce. The fried bread makes it decadent heaviness, the only problem is that it's difficult to justify a cheesecake purchase after eating.

My husband had the Blue Cheese Bacon burger - he really liked it but found that half way through the first half he had to use a fork/knife as it became too gooey.  This did not stop him or ruin his experience.  Nice fries were served with the burger in addition to the thick crispy bacon on the burger, toasted bun, thick tomato and about a 1/2 pound of meat!!!!  He cleaned the plate, so I guess he liked it.

I asked the hostess to put it in the freezer. I EVEN ASKED HER TO REMEBER ME. I told her i would be back in 40 minutes with the bday girl. I want her check and the cake to be brought out for a suprise dessert. When we finished our meal our server comes over and hands us a dessert menu!

32,James H.,"Tucson, AZ",0,5,,4.0,2014-06-12,"Tonight, I went to the Cheesecake Factory in order to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday. Upon arrival, we were promptly seated by one of the hostesses who quickly provided menus. The first thing I noticed as soon as I sat down was that the table was sticky and had crumbs scattered about. After getting up and locating a manager, I informed him of the situation and he was incredibly polite and efficient, sending a busboy to wipe down the table and apologizing the whole way. Next, we  got our food. My girlfriend ordered the Four Cheese Pasta with chicken and  I ordered the Southern Fried Catfish with mashed potatoes, corn, and asparagus (substituted for the green beans) upon the server's recommendation. Our server, Mark V. was incredibly polite and quick with everything, always refilling our drinks without being asked.  Now, the pasta was fine with the exception of the chicken which was painfully dry,  both myself and my girlfriend needed to take heavy swigs of our drinks in order to wash the chicken down entirely.  The catfish was horrible, with an incredibly heavy and overdone breading which required me to chisel it out with a blunt end of a fork., I literally proceeded to remove the breading to eat the fish, which was flavorless and limp. I literally stopped eating due to the amount of work and the sheer lack of flavor, leaving most of the food untouched.  We brought this up to the manager, who was incredibly polite and removed the catfish from the final check on the spot, offering to either make another order or allow me to try something different from the menu. Due to the time of night (about 2130) and not wanting to subject the kitchen staff to extra prep work and cooking, I decided to just have the item removed and proceeded to order a slice of the Lemon Raspberry Cheesecake to go.  Overall, I'd like to say that the experience was pleasant, catfish notwithstanding.

Today I ordered the new macaroni and cheese burger == described as a gourmet burger with oozing fried mac and cheese on the burger-- $12.75 -- I ordered mine with mayo and asked that it be cut in half-- I got it a long time later-- no mayo--not cut in half. Mac and cheese was a patty of mac and cheese that had been deep fried-- and it was cold-- the meat luke warm -- the sliced tomato cut hours before and the sliced onion old-- the  service was slow and the server was not attentive and as I got impatient waiting for a refill of iced tea ( a long wait) I decided to go get it myself-- only then did she appear form some where.   My wife had a salad that she reports not too bad and generous but the fried onion rings were stone cold making it very greasy and unappealing. The bread basked brought to the table was dried out so much that I could bang it on the table like a gavel-- really you could not get your teeth into it-- I told the waitress and demonstrated the hardness-- she said ""oh my"" and swept it up and hurried off towards the kitchen-- but did not bring back more( that was probably a blessing) I think something was up in the kitchen and the front too-- someone must have been missing or chaos had replaced order--  a great price for a big disappointment!!!!

I walked up to the door and noticed a few cigarette butts on the walkway outside the restaurant.  The front door was smudge free and the entryway was clean.  The temperature inside the restaurant was comfortable and the lighting and music levels were appropriate.  The hostess smiled and said ""Hi"".  I paused and said ""I'm here to pick up a to-go order.""  She said ""Oh, okay, you can pick it up at the bakery"" while gesturing to the bakery off to the left.  I thanked her and went to the bakery to pick up my order.

After I received my order, a gentleman I assume was a manager smiled and thanked me for my order while I was exiting the restaurant. I had ordered an Italian sandwich with complimentary salad and bread/butter.  The Italian sandwich was cool and served on crispy Ciabatta bread.  The fillings were plentiful and delicious.  A creamy white sauce was served on the side without a request.  The salad was crisp and fresh.  It was served with a Vinaigrette dressing on the side.  The sourdough bread was fresh and slightly warm, and served with several cool pats of butter.

Well to start, the place was poppin so it took us a while to get a table...about 30 mins to get an outside table...it seemed like half the town was in here haha But of course I love the bread the give you at the beginning omnomnom! And ooh that butter tho haha so good. It took us a while to pick what to eat because the menu is literally a book. I saw someone say on here that they need to cut it down a bit... I kinda agree... As long as they keep my new found favorites...miso Salmon and Javanese Salmon! O em geee...so good and I am glad that I found these dishes and decided to try them so now I can understand that Cheesecake Factory is not totally overpriced (I still think it is a little bit tho)  Anyways... Miso Salmon reminds me  of like a teriyaki type salmon and JavaneseSalmon hasabomb pesto sauce and the fish is sooo soft and juicy! Go try it!

There are more cheesecake flavors than NFL teams. We've had maybe six and all are yummers. Food is standard fare and I find it unremarkable. Good options for kids though, so it's a standard choice we can all agree on for a meal. This location is nice-- clean, attractive, active staff, and relatively quick for a table. They were also very cool to sing to my daughter for her birthday. (Tip: they used to comp the birthday person's dessert, but do not appear to do that anymore, or at least this location doesn't.) Service crew was nice and quick with drinks. However, the timing of dishes was random and our last person started eating almost ten minutes after the first person's dish arrived and we had to ask three times for missing utensils.

It is by far the most grand looking building within a mile of the Tucson mall and the interior is pretty captivating. You know most of it is great paint and partical board, but it doesn't make it less beautiful. C and I enjoy this place for lightly late night food and man oh man, do they have food! This business boasts a menu that is thicker than any children's book and has over 250 dishes. This ranges from pizza to asian lettuce wraps, burgers and pasta. The fascinating thing, they hit the nail on the head dish after dish. How one kitchen can have so many cuisines so well represented and produced is a wonder! Their wine list is comprehensive and they probaby have killer desserts. I behave and have never touched one.  They have a fair amount of items that with very minor modifications can be made vegan. Their Kale and Quinoa Salad can be made vegan and is my personal favorite It is a massive portion of hearty kale and quinoa with grapes and other suprising flavors. Their thai lettuce wraps are traditionally with chicken, but if you sub that with avocado you have a gorgeous display of an array of fillings for some flavorful wraps! The majority of their pastas are vegan and they have few sauces as well. The marinara, roasted tomato, thai pasta sauce and thai peanut sauce are all vegna friendly! Matt is by far the best server. He greets you with a genuine smile and always gives prompt, efficient service. He knows the ins and outs of the menu like he wrote it and you always feel like a genuine guest in his home. I always ask if Matt is there and if he is, his service is worth any wait!

First off I love the cheesecake factory, it seems to be the place my large Hispanic family chooses to meet for birthdays,anniversaries, and celebrations. Tonight march 27th 2015 my dear nieces sweet 16th birthday my family came together to celebrate and hope to have a great meal, good company and relaxing environment. Cheesecake factory Tucson was far from that. First off, they would not seat us until 80% of our party was there actually we were just missing 5 people of our 20 (don't know how they figured their math). So we waited good company in tow guys outside ladies inside. As we watched groups being seated who walked in within 5 minutes we began to get restless. Finally our entire group showed up and then we received our buzzer wait for it.. One hour and a half wait. We arrived at 7 we were not seated until almost 9 o'clock. Finally the buzzer sounds and relief we are being seated.. So we thought we began to take our seats only to find out we are 5 seats short. Hot and tired of waiting we notice a extra booth available. Asking for this booth was like asking for there first born. Ok , we are sat water poured kids happy, things are OK now so we thought. I sat in the booth with my husband two boys and my mom so we ordered. My Dad sat at the main table and the waitress waited to put my mothers order in until all 20 orders were taken. Meanwhile my little family of four received our food. My husband and mother ordered the same dish being the man I love and adore my husband received his food and gave it over to my mother so she could eat. The waitress proceeded to point out to my mother I'm sorry ma'am that's his order!? Really um really he's a respectable man who handed it over to her SK she could eat first and our waitress tried to make my mom feel bad about that, tactless. An hour later good company not so good service we are finishing up same tactless waitress comes over to my 5'2 100lb mom and says how was your food? My mom proceeds to acknowledge the waitress by saying good thank you but before she could this inexperienced waitress says ""oh I can tell!"" Excuse me so rude where is your tact go back to etiquette school. Done so done reacpect is earned not given so done with cheesecake factory we spent well over $600 as a group and we were treated like it was our problem they cannot cater to a large group of people.

The service was much better back then, but there is nothing bad about it now. They are very willing to accommodate specific orders.

Two marinated flattened, tender chicken breasts. Covered, covered in mushrooms and this lemon sauce. Served with a medium mound of Angel hair pasta. Really yummy! A lot of food. My wife had the Renee's Special, $11.50, described as one-half Chicken salad (or turkey) sandwich, a cup of soup, and a small green salad (or Caesar salad). These were the ""Lunch Specials."" It was a lot of food. As a matter of fact, what my wife received on her plate was a whole sandwich (two slices of bread with a generous amount of chicken salad), a *bowl* of soup (not a ""cup""), and a generous portion of salad. Before she took a bite, she called the waitress back to ask her if this was the lunch special because she did not want to pay for a full, regular meal. The waitress confirmed that it was a Renee's Lunch Special and that ""we like to stuff you here."" Uhm, yeah. The service was excellent. Checking on our progress and satisfaction without being intrusive or bothersome. I'm really impressed at how expensive the interior is from the marble tiling throughout to the heavy (but easily opened) doors and the massive hardware on them, to the decorations tastefully done on the walls and ceilings.

The bartender made my usual, slightly dirty vodka martini, (much needed for a stressful day). The martini was perfect, not too dirty and not too overly strong. As for these entree I gave the Thai Glazed salmon a try. To my surprise is was pretty tasty. It was glazed with coconut and had a little spice added to it. Wish it could have been more spicy though like real Thai spices! But overall it wasn't too bad. For dessert I had the tiramisu. Which was perfect! Soft and sweet just the way I like it!

184,Ruben G.,"Tucson, AZ",0,62,206.0,1.0,2016-08-09,"I've been meaning to post this for a while...      Came here 4:00pm July 2nd on a Saturday and the place wasn't busy at all.  From the moment we walked in we were never greeted by the hostess. We stood in front of the counter and she never acknowledged us. After a while I finally asked ""Hi can I get a table for two?"".  It took 10 minutes for our waitress to finally come take our drink order. The atmosphere around us in the beginning was a ruckus due to a large family sitting directly across from us. After a while the family left and left a mess on the table, the seats even under the table. A while later the bus boy cleaned the table and didn't bother with the floor. A long while later our waitress arrives and introduces us to Caesar our waiter for the remainder of the evening due to a shift rotation, ok not a problem (but odd).    Finally a while longer and three bread trays later our food arrives. Our meals looked appetizing, they were nice and hot, so far so good, I ordered Spicy Cashew Chicken. I stir part of my food to incorporate the sauce into the rice, I'm in my third bite, I'm chewing and there's something stringy in my mouth I pull the string to discover a 4 inch piece of hair. Gross, I know. I stopped eating. Caesar arrives we told him about the hair, he  apologized said he'd bring a fresh plate. I asked him to take hubbys  plate as well and keep it warm. A few minutes later a manager (whose name I didn't get cause he wasn't wearing a name badge) came to our table to apologize for the hair in my food and the kitchen was preparing me a fresh plate. The manager noticed the table behind him (where the large family was) he squatted and saw the mess that was under the table then he left (I thought he was gonna have somebody come clean up that mess). A while later Caesar arrives with our food. They brought Hubby a freshly made meal as well, I thought that was really nice. On the surface mine looked just as good as the first until I stirred the food. They put so much sauce on my plate and very little rice, my rice was oozing with sauce and that sauce isn't spicy it is very very sweet, I couldn't eat it, it was discussing. We got the attention of a waiter that was by our table and asked him for more rice. He said he would and get out waiter over. Caesar arrived, we told him about the dish being too sweet, at that time the other waiter arrived with a bowl of rice. Caesar asked if everything was fine now that we had the bowl of rice or would I rather a fresh plate with new white rice and just have the chicken taken off the bad plate and placed on the new plate, I said ""Yes that'll be fine just don't put too much sauce over the chicken"". Caesar arrived for the third time with my plate and what a joke it was. What the kitchen staff did was they got a plate, took the extra rice that was in the bowl that the other waiter brought me and literally dumped the entire super sweet discussing chicken with rice and sauce over the white rice (no garnish, no effort). It looked like crap and that's putting it lightly. That was the last straw. I got upset told Caesar I was paying for any of this. We got up, walked towards the exit. As we got up to leave another family was being seated at the table with trash underneath (the manager never had somebody clean under the table).  As we walked towards the exit we saw the manager and told him what just took place and even brought it to his attention that he did nothing about the dirty table after he had noticed it. We straight up walked out of there after spending an entire hour there (still hungry). We will never go the Tucson Cheesecake Factory again and I don't recommend you do either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tucson?start=40,3.2,3.02,3.02,2.6600000000000006,3.0920000000000005

190,Jenny D.,"Tucson, AZ",9,71,45.0,3.0,2016-08-25,"Hadn't been to a Cheesecake Factory in years, and decided to go for lunch with some friends.  Goodness, I forgot how expensive this place was.  It seems innocent to start, until you get your bill and realize you spent nearly $50 for lunch.  Partly, this was my fault.  When ordering mojitos (if there isn't a price listed on the menu, and you don't ask when ordering, it's ones own fault for ordering an $11.25 drink), and cheesecake for take away, it will be more expensive than a regular lunch.   Hours listed on the door had 11a, they opened the doors at 11:05a.  Not a biggie.  Seated right away.  One person in our group was running late, informed the server as such.  After getting a drink order from her, it was difficult to catch her attention again to order when our buddy was going to be really late, and told us to go ahead and eat.  Turkey and avocado sandwich was decent, nothing extraordinary.  Sweet potato fries were good and way too much for several folks to eat.   The slice of caramel pecan turtle cheesecake was excellent, highlight of the meal.  Just not enough to justify the price of everything.  Maybe I'm getting stingy in my old age, but that was a lot of money for a decent lunch.  If I was getting a steak dinner with wine, this price point would be more appropriate.  (In my ""you kids get off my lawn"" and ""where's my damn discount"" sort of way)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tucson?start=40,3.32,3.03,3.03,2.8920000000000003,3.146

5,Ashlee V.,"Tucson, AZ",10,131,24.0,3.0,2016-09-10,Sad to say I was genuinely unimpressed with this particular location. First off the Service was very slow... We ordered and they claimed to be out of bread but one minute later a different sever walked by with bread for his table. We ordered our Cheesecake Factory usual and then finally bread was delivered. Our server was nice enough at first. When our food arrived we noticed that the pastas seemed very watery. And the more we tasted our food the more we saw that it was extremely watery and lacked taste. We waited for a full 10 minutes for our server to reappear.  We explained this to our server and said our daughter wasn't going to eat the watery Alfredo and asked for it to be taken off the ticket. We showed her that you could literally stir the sauce like it was milk.  This is when the server developed an attitude. Instead of being apologetic and asking if our daughter wanted something else or offering to get her another one she took the plate and became extremely standoffish. She could clearly see that the food was not right but somehow offended that we returned it. We went on to order cheesecake to go and she continued to have an attitude.  They did take my daughters meal off the ticket but she also went without dinner and they didn't seem to care.

For Cheesecake, it's basically everything on the menu besides the desserts. The dessert is fantastic but every single time, the actual food has just been totally underwhelming and over priced. I think this restaurant is almost stressing themselves out over the ridiculous sized menus that they offer. The ONLY reason of me ever coming back here has to be the Oreo or The Original Cheesecake.

We had 7 in our group, and our table was put together quite quickly. It took a little bit for our server to get to us. When he did arrive, Brandon did a great job and I have no complaints about him. He gave us fresh bread when requested and kept our water glasses filled. Unfortunately, it took a long time for us to get our meals. I know meals for 5 adults and 2 kids might take longer than most, but we waited a good half hour between ordering and receiving our food. The food wasn't anything spectacular and my meal could've used more salt and some spice. I shared the Snickers cheesecake for dessert that absolutely blew my mind. Brandon boxed up my leftovers (always appreciated because I always make a mess).  While we were there, he was given a group of about 25 girls from out of town, yet he did not neglect his duties to our table.

I got a beer and sat and talked with my wife. We took a look at some menus and decided to go with the chicken Alfredo and my wife got the chili with rice. We waited about 25 mins and my wife's dish came out first. A min or so later my dish came out and the first thing I noticed when she set it down on our table was a big black hair resting on top. She turned and left and I pulled the dish in for a closer look to confirm my sighting. It was in fact a hair and I called the waitress back immediately. She was quick to take it away to fix it (as the general rule with that situation is to get it off the floor asap) and a few moments later a manager came to speak with us. He simply apologized and said they do their best to minimize hairs and that they do wear hair nets. I wondered why dishes weren't checked or given a final once over before going to the customer.... They did bring me out a new dish in about 5 minutes but this time it was missing the parsley but I was starving and already had to send it back once so i kept it. At first the dish was great and I had taken maybe 7 bites but it quickly got bland as my hunger was suppressed. The chicken seemed to be unseasoned and the pasta was missing the garnish. Not to mention my wife's dish was also bland and lacking spices.    At the end our waiter offered asked us if we wanted a piece of cheesecake which we assumed would be gifted for the wait and hair in our dish but were surprised to find it and the full amount of our dinner on our bill.  Perhaps it was poor judgement on our part to assume MGMT would compensate us anything for the hair but the same thing happened at Oregano's a couple years ago and they comped the item.. either way Cheesecake Factory did not.  We tipped our server $7 and took home our leftovers which tasted even worse next meal.  ========================================= Update 2.24.17 Cheesecake Factory guest services called me yesterday and asked me about my experience and told me they would be contacting the location about it. Then today I got an email with a $50 gift card and an invitation to try them again. My wife and I were pleasantly surprised and will mos def be visiting them again in the future.  ========================================= Update 3.1.17 - My wife and I went back to the same location tonight for dinner.

The bread is good as it always is-(does everyone fill up on bread?) The food came by way of 4 servers--Wow feeling special-- IT is now quiet while everyone is busy eating. First review is the mashed potatoes which are rich and flavorful perhaps a little too much pepper. Next is the Fettuccine Alfredo my daughter said she liked it-it was creamy and rich. My sister had Chicken  Castaletta which is her usual order. The chicken was moist and the asparagus was large add the mashed potatoes for a big meal. Next came a mac and cheese burger she usually gets the  Louisiana Chicken Pasta so she stepped out of the box! She liked it as there isn't any burger left!
