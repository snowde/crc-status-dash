401,Erin R.,"SAN PEDRO, CA",2,23,,4.0,2012-01-14,"I have been to loads of Cheesecake Factories by now. Living in 4 different states in major cities. I like them usually, but they would not be my first choice of restaurant when asked. Which is why I was pleasantly surprised at the Southcenter Mall location. We went on a packed Friday night, so we had the usual wait, but once we got seated we never felt that the waiters were super busy. We placed our drink and food orders promptly and our food arrived in perfect timing. Our drinks were refilled constantly and we never felt like we had to wait to get something. Compared to many Cheesecakes in the past, this one surpassed them all in terms of service. Bravo Tukwila! (I still don't know how to pronounce that!) The food was also good-It didn't taste like it had been sitting under a heat lamp or anything. My husband and I split the Louisiana chicken pasta and it was delicious! A first for both of us and we will for sure order it again. We split it so that we could get our own desserts and not spend a crapload. I got the Godiva cheesecake, my husband got the tiramisu. Both were yummy. I must say that I may suggest Cheesecake Factory for another dinner date in the near future!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=400,3.04,3.04,3.04,3.12,3.0400000000000005
387,Rachel F.,"Bremerton, WA",10,16,,1.0,2012-01-23,"If you feel a deep hankering for their cheesecake, do yourself a favor and order it to go. If you are a first timer to a Cheesecake Factory some pointers -Don't go on a weekend night.  They don't take reservations -Expect a large menu (great if you are going out with a ton of different picky eater but always a bad sign in a restaurant since there is no real ""specialty"") -huge portions so skip the apps, or use them as your meal if you are staying for their namesake The Good:  The dessert was wonderful and our substitute waiter was an absolute delight.  We wish we could have given him the tip. The Bad:  The food.  The wait, feeling very rushed (the apps came out mere minutes before after our apps and dinners were grabbed from the kitchen as they came so we all were eating at different times at the same table.  Our waitress.  The Experience.... For the first time we doubled dated with our friends (a married couple with +1 expected) and let the lady with the bump choose our place to eat. After our hours drive and hour wait to get seated we were all pretty ready to eat. Our server was pleasant enough and took our order, brought us our bread and drinks.....and then went on break. Our apps came out a half hour after seating along with the pre-dinner salads.  Not normal but we didn't complain since we finally had food on the table.  As most people are, when I'm hungry my standards slip dramatically, and I was ready for anything.  Anything except what I got.  I ordered the crab and artichoke dip for an app....it tasted of warm mayonnaise some artichoke and the crab was probably juice since it tasted awful.  I took a few bites and had to waive the flag.  I chowed down on my partners potstickers (pretty good!) We hadn't even finished our apps when 1/2 of the dinners arrived.  There was no sense of timing with the waitstaff and the kitchen.  We did not hold up our pregnant friend from eating and had the rest of the apps boxed up.  This was really upsetting since one of the apps was just guac and chips. Boxing that up felt insulting. The dinner.  After the disappointing apps I was ready for dinner, and with lower expectations.  It still didn't soften the blow.   I ordered Wasabi encrusted Ahi tuna with veggies instead of rice.  The wasabi encrusted Ahi was bland.  Hats off to the chef for making that combo bland.  Ahi is so flavorful unless its of poor quality or storage.  You dont even cook it....I mean scewing Ahi up is just sad and points to a rather obvious problem at this place....no quality control whatsoever.  Bland wasabi?  Are you kidding me?  I had my friends husband try it and he agreed.  I was left with shredded buttered veggies. At this point its been 3 hours....I've barely eaten and the money invested in this meal would have gotten me a pair of designer jeans.   I didn't waive my flag just yet.  I had to order cheesecake....I was hungry and well....hungry. Hooray!  They didn't screw up the cheesecake!  I ordered the Godiva chocolate cheesecake and it was blissful.  The coffee was awful but was turned around with sugar and cream (as Tom described it: it tasted like the industrial sh** coffee we have on the submarine).  Our actual server was so useless for the first time in my life I tipped pre-tax and rounded down. Save yourself the trip, even if you want to impress a girl, take her out to some fancy expensive LOCAL place....the bill goes up way to fast here (no alcohol was ordered either), not to mention the wait or the waitstaff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=380,2.92,2.98,2.98,2.7560000000000002,2.956

We decided to take our family of 7 to this place for dinner. The place was busy and we waited for about 15 minutes. We were seated and our waiter, David, presented himself to announce the specials for the day. There could have been a teleprompter that he was reading from, for all of the lack of warmth and personality that he didn't have. Dude are you working for tips or what? Ok, so 10 minutes go by and he comes back. We order, he says would you like some bread to begin with, we say sure. Ok another 15 minutes and where is the bread? Hmmm....we're really hungry at this point. Here comes the bread, fast forward another 20 minutes and here come our meals. Well all of our meals minus one. My daughter doesn't get her meal and we say to David, who btw, does not serve but others do, we're missing a meal.He says I know it's coming. Well thanks buddy, we're feeling the warmth for sure. Another 15 minutes and finally here is her meal. 3 of our party ordered pasta, all 3 of these were so incredibly salty that they were uneatable. I order the bacon and shrimp sandwich with fries which was ok but the fries were heavily salted, nope can't eat them. My grandson had a kids pizza, wasn't regular mozzarella but a combination of something, which he didn't care for. My son had a burger which oddly enough wasn't salted enough. One of our party had the salmon with mashed potatoes which he said was great. We don't see David for awhile, he comes back to clear dishes. He sees that the dishes are hardly eaten but he neither offers nor comments on this. Our only saving grace for this meal was the cheesecake for dessert. Any hey people, please look at your receipts, an 18% gratuity is added on but your server will not tell you this. If you don't read this, you will probably add another tip on top of what they are already making. So again, if you want some really great cheesecake, have at it and come to this place. If I'm going to take my family of 7 somewhere, it won't be to this place again. For paying almost $200.00 for this meal, nope my expectations are a bit higher.

It wasn't ideal, but I worked with it.  Ultimately, my group didn't get seated until 9:20 pm (which was 4 hrs & 20 minutes of waiting).      Anyways, I went ahead and put my name down since I arrived early and decided to waste the rest of my time at the Mall close by.  When I came back a couple of hours later, we didn't get seated until 9:20 pm (when I was expecting more like 8 pm.   When I asked the hostess about how long, she had a very condescending tone every time I talked with her.  There were other seemingly nice hostess, but the one that I spoke to twice was not very pleasant.  She also told me twice that a table would be ready soon (within 5-10 minutes or so because they were clearing out the table) but she forgot about us twice.  After 20 minutes of waiting, I had to go up and ask another male host if the table was ready.  He was much nicer, but told me that a table wasn't ready yet and the outdoor table was still ordering dessert, which was a much different story than what she told me before.  The hostess said they were clearing out the tables, not that the previous table was just ordering dessert.   When we finally sat down, the other waitress was nice, but I was in a bad mood already and it didn't make up for the experience.  The food was okay, but it wasn't amazing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=280,3.48,3.09,3.09,2.2760000000000002,3.246

I started off with my usual wings. They were standard. Nothing too great but not bad either. After sifting through the menu 20 times, I finally just decided to get an Americana cheeseburger. I would have liked to try something different but there was too much stuff to decide. I'm not mad I got my burger though, it was extremely delicious. I even had enough leftovers for lunch the next day. Whatever the special sauce is, it's amazing. So why only 3 stars?? The service was terrible. I don't know how it usually is but they took about an hour and a half just to take our order. The lady was nice and I don't know if it was her fault but that was ridiculous.

444,Rod P.,"Renton, WA",0,6,,1.0,2013-04-16,"On Sunday, April 14th, we were invited to attend a friends birthday celebration at the Cheesecake Factory in Tukwila, Wa. My friend had called ahead to inquire about getting reservations as we had a party consisting of nine people. She was told ""The Cheesecake factory does not accept reservations. Just show up and place your name on the wait list."" OK, no problem. We all arrived at about 4:30 and proceeded to place our name on the wait list at which time we were told by hostess that because we had such a large party that she would have to check with the manager first. Uh...weren't we told to just show up and place our name on the list? After standing around for 15 minutes wondering if we had been forgotten, the hostess returns and tells us that they would be able to accommodate our party, but that, ""it would be an hour and fifteen minute wait."" If you check on their website it states, ""We are able to easily accommodate large parties"" Really!? Exactly how was our experience accommodating?  Now mind you that it was Sunday afternoon and the restaurant was exceptionally slow that day. Yes, there were people milling about waiting for a table, but not the normal, people-stepping-on your-toes-line-outside-the-door type of busy. The decision was made to go elsewhere rather than wait for more than an hour just to be seated. The funny thing was that when my friend posted her displeasure on The Cheesecake Factory, they immediately took down her comments. I guess they don't want anyone to critique their restaurant. You would think that they would welcome feedback in order to help improve their customer relations. We will never go back to the Cheesecake Factory again as a result of this horrible experience. There are much better places to dine at that are more than happy to accommodate us and who serve much better food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=460,2.72,3.1,3.1,2.6920000000000006,2.9480000000000004

We went to the mall to kill time and called after an hour instead of going in. Good news, they were preparing the table.

309,Ahmed K.,"Federal Way, WA",3,26,3.0,5.0,2013-04-21,"I know what you might be thinking right now: Why do you give a chain restaurant five stars? My answer in this case: Exceptional customer service. While I've never really cared much about customer service when I eat out in general, I was amazed with how good it can get when the restaurant management knows its customer service. This was not my first visit to the Cheesecake Factory. In fact, I've been going to the Tukwila and other branches for a while now, but never felt the urge to write a review on it, until today. I went with a friend here for dinner. It was the typical Sunday evening wait time (20 minutes). However, we were seated in about 12 minutes. My friend ordered the salmon with a white butter sauce (they said it wasn't on the menu and it was today's special). I enjoyed the fact that their skinnylicious menu was big enough to have dishes that satisfy practically any taste. I have been dieting and counting calories so I went with the shrimp creole (less than 590 calories, not bad for dinner). Of course, I had to have a couple pieces of their dark honey whole wheat bread, amazingly tasty as usual. My friend and I kept talking and talking for a while only to be interrupted by the manager saying: ""I am really sorry your dinner is taking so long. Your dish looked like someone else's order and was sent to another table. In the mean time can I offer you a complimentary soup or salad?"". I didn't even notice the food was taking so long! Maybe I wasn't so hungry, but still I found it be a great gesture coming from the manager himself and without us even complaining or asking about food. My friend's dish came out 5 minutes after that and mine 5 minutes later, each time with the server apologizing for the delay. I got my dish and it was flavorful, filling and a nice change to the diet food I eat on daily basis. The server checked on us twice, the second time she says: ""I hope you enjoyed your meal and don't worry we'll take care of that for you"". Huh? I thought you already apologized by giving me a complimentary salad. When she brought the bill, they deducted my dish from the total. So basically I got a free salad and entree! The reason I am emphasizing on this is because I wasn't even angry the food took so long, I was enjoying the conversation with my friend. But again that goes to show you that some people take pride in their job and provide excellent customer service. I've been here on many occasions, loving their food from pastas to steaks to cheesecakes.

Since he first came to us (my boyfriend and I), his customer service was horrible and he made it clear that he did not want to be our server for whatever reason. His attitude was bad and chewed gum obnoxiously whenever he talked to us. Our bread he gave us was cold and when I tried to get his attention while he walked past us to get it warmed up, it took me two tries to call him over and he still walked past me but said ""okay."" When we came back to our table to grab the cold bread, he just chews his gum and grabs the bread from the top, touching the entire thing with his palm. That was disgusting. We were very polite to him and always said thank you whenever he gave us something but his attitude was still bad. It's funny that I observed that he was being incredibly nicer to other tables and not ours, perhaps because I am not an older white american like those at the other table? Who knows. I am giving this three stars because the food is great. Our Chicken Bellagio tasted very good, and it is my go-to order at Cheesecake Factory.

It is also a convenient location with lots of food options, and so I find myself coming back here. My favorite cheesecake is the white chocolate raspberry truffle.

389,Dalin C.,"Kent, WA",134,51,11.0,3.0,2013-12-13,"I have been to The Cheesecake Factory when it was my idea one time. Every other time, I tagged along. The Cheesecake Factory is a mainstream restaurant. A very mainstream restaurant. So what you will find there is a large establishment with bells, whistles, and money left over for more bells and whistles. The decor is very colorful and from what I understand they're all designed in-house. It's almost like walking into the Island of Misfit Decorations, but the odd shapes, hand-blown glass lighting, and cherry wood accent section.  I am convinced that the Cheesecake Factory believes that more is more. More cheesecake. More art to look at. More pages to turn in our menu. If you go to the Cheesecake Factory, be prepared for an experience that can put your eyes on overload.       My service came with a smile. Sometimes that's all you need. Sometimes it can come off feeling like the most generic action a waiter musters up. Unfortunately, I felt like I got the latter off of this visit. It was a Thursday evening and just as busy as a Friday. Did you know people eat everyday? Anyway, back to the service. It was quick. It was painless. For a restaurant that big and one that caters to so many different appetites, I'm not expecting to fall in love. He checked on us often and save one time, I never felt neglected.      The food portions are where this place genuinely shines. Be hungry. Otherwise, your right or left hand will be carrying something extra when you leave. Every time. From pasta to sandwiches to steak to seafood to pasta again, there are over 200 menu choices to make your waiter come back at least 4 times before you decide. Tonight, I had the Tex-Mex Egg rolls, Chicken Bellagio, and a Mai Tai. My table was all around the world and back. The egg rolls were good. Quite good, in fact, and were accompanied by a small bowl of pico de gallo and avocado cream. However, the egg rolls tasted and looked like something I could have popped in the microwave for three minutes. Presentation didn't scream gourmet to me. Now typically where The CF succeeds in spades is in the presentation of their entrees. The Chicken Bellagio did not disappoint. Lightly breaded chicken over basil pasta and topped with Parmesan cream sauce, prosciutto, and arugula salad. It looked delicious. It looked ready for me to show the efforts of all my knife and fork combination training. It looked ready.  It was ok.       The chicken, while wonderfully breaded, wasn't the most flavorful and the cream sauce was not as plentiful as it probably should have been. It was more of a hint of sauce than it was a layer over the pasta. That could have been the intention all along, I'm not sure. The arugula salad didn't do much to compliment the overall taste of the dish. I've heard great reviews on this meal, so I was a little surprised to come across this. Didn't end up being bad. It was just a little basic. The mai tai, even after stirring a little, didn't blend very well. The sweetness stayed at the top and the rum hung out with the ice when I got to the bottom. I may have needed to stir mor, but every good mai tai I have had, had that nice sweet and sour blend top to bottom.      A couple things I want to note: I wish that there was some manner or method to the madness to being able to control the herds that are waiting for a table. It clogs up the hostess area, the entryways to the tables, and the place where you can make purchases. I understand there's basically just standing room with a couple of benches, but when you have kids and the elderly coming through, not everyone is paying attention. Fact is, most folks think it's absolutely fine not getting out of the way. That's not Cheesecake Factory's fault. However, what is, is their lack of crowd control. Another thing, I really...really wish they would put the silverware on the napkin. Or something. I understand that the tables get cleaned and wiped down before they're put there, but that rag used... unless it's within their guidelines to use a fresh rag each and every time, then I'm going to need better.      Overall, for the pricing, there are better options. For taste, there are better options. They're not quite the fresh ingredient-using, gourmet restaurant that all advertisement claims to be. However, your appetite and eyes will be full by the time you leave. If you go, enjoy it. Part of any restaurant experience is also what you make of it. And I wish you well on your parking journey. I don't know if I have yet to be at a TCF that did not have a ""parking lot situation"" at almost any time of the day. I'll go back. But it won't ever be my idea to do so.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=380,3.44,3.2,3.2,3.0200000000000005,3.2960000000000007

182,Karen D.,"Renton, WA",53,347,,4.0,2013-12-18,"It takes a lot for me to give a restaurant a 2nd review, especially a chain, but,  I just had to give some love to the Southcenter Cheesecake Factory.  Went here for an office dinner and drinks party to celebrate the holidays.  All I can say is wow.  For starters, there were 12 of us, and we needed the bill split up all kinds of crazy ways...it was ""separate checks"", but those of us who were there with our spouse wanted checks for 2.  Then I decided to treat the table to a bunch of appetizers.  Another person bought the wine.  One of the couples bought cheesecake slices for the table.  And so on.  Somehow our angel of a server, Michelle, managed to keep everything straight.   Michelle and the people who backed her up were just perfect. Michelle was friendly, helpful, and efficient.  Everything came out right when it was supposed to, drinks cold and food hot.  I also have to give a nod to the bartender named Ivy, as those who ordered cocktails thought her mixed drinks were divine, particularly the lemon drop, which at least 3 people at the table were swooning over, and not just from the alchohol! The food received mixed reviews from the group.  As I have noted before, Cheesecake Factory can be inconsistent in the food department. I never order pasta there because they usually overcook it for my taste.  I know what I like there, and that is the grilled salmon with sauteed spinach and mashed potatoes. I usually order that and am happy.  This was no exception.  My spouse ordered the exact same thing, but unfortunately her salmon was overcooked and dry.  That's the inconsistency I'm talking about.   You generally can't go wrong with the cheesecake for dessert.  I ordered the tiramisu flavor, which I have liked in the past, but this time there was an off taste to it; just not sure why.  The reeses peanut butter cheesecake was awesome.   All in all, we had a fabulous time at the office Christmas party this year, and it had a lot to do with the wonderful service and atmosphere at the Southcenter C.F.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=200,3.48,3.22,3.22,3.088,3.3240000000000007

349,Myduyen N.,"Seattle, WA",92,132,80.0,2.0,2014-06-10,Our family used to go here often but it has gotten busier and the wait is just ridiculous! It's hard to wait when long when you have kids.  I went here yesterday and the wait wasn't too long. We were seating within five minutes.  Our server took our drink orders and we ordered food for the kids so that they don't become anxious. It always work from our experiences! After we got our drinks we ordered our food. A little after we ordered our food we were told that our original server was helping out while our server was on break. They were both really nice.  Our appetizer came out and a little after that our entrees came out. We didn't really have time to finish our appetizer which was fine. We still didn't get the pizza for the kids so we asked our server. She checked into it and was honest. She told us that the ordered wasn't place. She must've told her manager who came by to apologize. He offered a fruit bowl to my daughter while she waits for the pizza.  The pizza came out burnt and the crust was somewhat hard so the kids didn't eat the crust.  We ordered the tater tots which was ok. I wouldn't order it again. It tasted good the first two bites. We also ordered the Louisiana chicken pasta which is absolutely delicious! I love how much pasta they give you. I was able to pack some home for lunch!  Of course we don't leave without ordering dessert. We had to order the red velvet cheesecake to go because we were stuffed. We ate some when we got home. It was amazing!! It was a decent size so we were able to save some for later! I highly recommend the red velvet cheesecake or the Godiva chocolate cheesecake. Those two will never fail ur sweet cravings!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=340,3.32,3.2,3.2,3.0800000000000005,3.2480000000000007

Happy Things- The Cheesecake, and any dessert for that matter, is always good- ALWAYS.  My fat cells jiggle for joy when I come here because they know they are about to get some new friends.  My favorite cheesecakes are the Pineapple Upside Down, the Tuxedo, and you can never go wrong with the classic.   The portion sizes are huge.  It is true that this place is pricey, but you do get a really big portion for what you order.  Also, you can never actually eat said portion size because you will fill up on bread (and by ""you"" I mean I will fill up on bread, delicious carbs, mmmm). The food is never bad; you always know what you are going to get, and truly, that's what chain restaurants are for.  If you want an experience that is unique and tasty, don't go to a chain restaurant.  The fried mac and cheese if phenomenal, and event though it is an appetizer, I routinely get it for my meal.  Bread, fried mac and cheese, and cheesecake- perhaps this is why my jeans keep shrinking and my dryer isn't the culprit... The menu is huge, and anyone can find something tasty here.  Just keep in mind, that as a chain restaurant recipes are meant to appeal to as many tastebuds as possible.  That means that the flavors are going to be safe, but find something you like in the comfort food/Southern fare area of things, and you will probably enjoy what you get.  If you order Thai food here and expect what you are used to in the Seattle area- that is all on you, chief.  Expectations, people- you don't get good Thai from an American chain restaurant. I have never had bad service here; the wait staff is busy, but they work it!  Sometimes I have had the thought that some restaurants that are 25% full, have stationary servers, and empty customer glasses could learn a few things from The Cheesecake Factory wait staff. Sad things-  You will WAIT to come here unless you come at a weird time.  And by waiting I mean stand forever.  The lines are are sooo long.  Either be prepared to wait, or come at like 11 AM.   Price- it's not super pricey, but for what you spend here in the Seattle area, you could get something much better.  Don't expect a $15 lunch, however. Drinks- never bad, never strong, very generic.  If you want a great cocktail that is over $10, go to a bar, not The Cheesecake Factory.  The drinks are flashy, but it the bartenders are never generous on the alcohol side of things.   I have been here more than once, and I will probably be back.  Have your expectations in line, and you won't have a terrible time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=220,3.72,3.32,3.32,3.184,3.4800000000000004

The waiter/server didn't come by to offered anyone any drinks or to take appetizer order till 15 minutes later. I find that to be unacceptable.

Yet after observing other server and other tables, we notice that servers are still bringing the bread to the table without being ""asked"". So what made us that special??? I also had asked for a couple extra butter and more bread. But he never came with them. Near the end of the meal, I asked him to add a loaf of bread to my order so I can take it home. He was like ""oh im sure you can get it for free and that I wont have to add it to your order."" But it was on my bill in the end. I mean, I was planning to pay anyways, but why would you suggest something or say something if you can't follow up with it.

207,Roger F.,"Seattle, WA",1,3,,5.0,2014-09-20,"Hi fellow foodies, it's Roger here I'm back with an review of the Cheesecake Factory Restaurant In Southcenter Mall! Okay let me start off by saying I had a nephew who worked here in the early 2000's so I'm a little biased to give this review because I almost feel like it's my family's own restaurant but I'll try to give a fair Everydayman's prespective. Okay now that I got that out of the way about my nephew, who worked here in the early 2000's, here is my fair, Everydayman's prespective: The Cheesecake Factory Restaurant In Southceneter Mall is in my top 10 Restaurants List, and the review book I'm currently working on (think Zagets Rating or Michelens Stars) will have a much longer in depth ""long form read"" about the ins and out of this place. It's what us on the food blog circuit call a Top Crown. I honestly wonder if the people who haven't yet given this 5 starts have a rare taste bud syndrome that's causes them to have a bad taste in their mouth. I say ""who haven't yet given its 5 stars"" because I think, if they actually DO have this so called rare taste bud syndrome and then they someday lord willing get this syndrome fixed, they when then later get this place the 5 stars it deserves. Here is a short list of things, to be fair, that I think The Cheesecake Factory Restauarant in SouthCenter Mall could improve: 1. When I visited here there menu had a breakfast section and a breakfast item called ""Factory Heuvos Ranchers"". Huevos, in case you didn't know, I think it means Eggs in Mexico. Now look, I know that the large appetite of America for Eggs means that we must use factory chickens farms in order to supply America's large appetite for Eggs, but it's awfully off putting to see it listed on their menu that the Eggs are factory made. Although I can understand that they want their consumers to know exactly where they get their Eggs, so for that I give it a Pass! When my ex wife who has since passed God bless her, would come here, she would always order the same thing, every time, like a clockwork! I can't remember what it was, but in closing, I think I'd like to quote her, if you friends don't mind, about her favorite thing about here. It's from a diary entry she wrote before she passed, and I found it while sitting out her things. I think it pretty much says it all:  ""It seems like we come here all the time and every time Roger says we're coming here, I wonder if I'd made a mistake. I always end up getting the same thing, and it's usually pretty good but...""  And then she goes on a little bit more into detail but I think what really stands out about her review is that she loves the food and most importantly she found that it was ""Always really good"" her words not mine. That, my foody friends, is what we reviewers call a one heck of a endorsement! Try out The Cheesecake Factory In South Center Mall in Tukwila near Renton, Today!

Duh, I said to let me know when it's open again. I was not pleased with my first encounter at this cheesecake. And it has been open for along while now and it's still busy! May as well go to Bellevue or Seattle... At least the food is consistent so, doesn't matter which location you go to. My experience with the takeout staff was very smooth. The gal at the cheesecake counter was nice, friendly and accommodating. I called in my desert order and they had it ready for me. That I really liked. I just wished the front desk would have been as accommodating. I totally understand medical issues happen, all I wanted was to be notified if the bar opened back up. I didn't need the attitude.

I was incredibly disappointed in the actual food.  Uninspired, their menu has no focus and as little a theme as the decor.   The wait is atrocious, with a standard 30 minute stand by via walk in.  To reserve requires a party of 7 and only available during certain hours.  Without a 30 minute wait, being seated within 10 minutes of walking in you can still expect a 30 minute wait to get your food, even if your order is in immediately.  I had an almost 20 minute wait on my wine, which was needed much sooner. I had the factory burger on wheat with sweet potato fries.  I ate the first half, having to soak up the very sharp and bitter red that I was sipping.  The burger was incredibly dry.  So much so that I gave half of the half of my burger that I was eating to my husband, who then slathered it with ketchup and then choked a little because it was still too dry.  How can you screw up a burger?  The fries were over done.   Dave had the meatloaf.  It would be better compared to salsbury steak rather than meatloaf.  It was covered in a dark, almost BBQ like sauce and coated below was a slather of caramelized onion.  The mashed potatoes were bland and covered with a very salty gravy.  I have found that salt in access is usually a sign of a cover up, which makes me nervous for the hubby.  He fed me a bite and offered a second and I asked him as sweetly as possible not to put anymore near me.  Ick.

138,Josh B.,"Lacey, WA",256,907,6237.0,3.0,2014-11-29,"Sigh....I really want to give this Cheesecake Factory more than 3 stars, but I simply cannot. There are a lot of positives but the one negative that I will explain below really put a damper on the entire experience.  It's hard for me not to like Cheesecake. They are usually always busy in the restaurant area as well as the pickup and cheesecake counter. So, it's popular and slightly trendy.  They have at least 8-12 pages on their menu with a lot...and I mean A LOT of options for practically every diet or set of taste buds. I'm not sure how many of the items are gluten-free though so I would check the menu online before you come. There were a lot of options for myself as a vegetarian, so I was happy about that.  They usually set you up with some warm bread and butter while you wait and skim the menu, but don't eat too much bread because usually the portion size for your entrée is quite large so your eyes need to be as big as your stomach.  I opted for a Veggie Burger as I wasn't feeling like one of the many pastas that I could have eaten. It was actually a good size but basically fell apart as it is mainly made of brown rice and black beans. It would have been better without a bun since the bun didn't serve it's purpose of holding the burger. The burger was also lacking in flavor which was kind of odd since it was basically homemade and some spice or grill flavor could have been added to raise the basic burger up a notch or two.  I didn't opt for cheesecake this time as I didn't want to be too stuffed for the ride home, although most of their cheesecakes are pretty original and very good.  Now to the one item that really stuck in my craw. We went around 7 or 8 in the evening. Understandably, the ambience is suppose to be a little more romantic or intimate with how dimly lit the place was. Seriously though, it was SO dark that we could not see the menus without squinting. We all had to actually take out our cell phones to shed light on the subject. I actually went into the bathroom with the menu because there was more light in there to see. Also, it's hard to see your food when it's so dark and I like to see what I'm eating as sight is a part of the experience of eating along with smell, touch, taste, and even sound. Also if I can see what I'm eating I can tell if it's undercooked or has hair in it or something else. All I'm saying is it would have been nice to have a lamp or light directly on the table or maybe even a faux candle that would brighten up things without sacrificing the intimate feel of the experience.  I will be back to this Cheesecake Factory, but during the daytime. Also, parking can be a little hectic too since it's right outside the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=120,3.4,3.45,3.208,2.604,3.43

The chicken was cooked well and delicious. Of the three sauces provided, I enjoyed the peanut sauce the most. The Chicken Madeira was fantastic. The sauce and mushrooms on their own were amazing, but when paired with the cheese-covered chicken they were absolutely on point. The dish was a little under $20, but was a decent portion size.

It took forever to place orders and receive them. I saw plenty of staff walking past the table, but no one actually helped us. The times we did receive service it was friendly.  I ordered a margarita (which is served straight up) and received a martini. *sigh* I'm not into gin, but it took so long to receive (~40 min) that I opted to just put up with it, it's was okay (until I keep the price in mind, not worth it!!).

Our food was pretty good but surprisingly the cheesecake wasn't amazing. It was the reeses one.. I think maybe it's too complicated and i should stick to simple, classic cheesecake. The thing that was really off putting was our server. I will remember his name so that I can make sure we don't get him again. We were there for over an hour and he literally never smiled once. Every time we said thank you (which was often), he never once said ""you're welcome"". He seemed annoyed at every turn and when we requested to sit at a booth after just being seated at one of the high bar tables, he looked at me like I had just asked him to fetch me a pot of gold.

225,Shane Y.,"Seattle, WA",46,176,17.0,1.0,2015-03-23,"I will never, for the life of me understand how this place is always busy. Its a chain restaurant that serves horrible meals at asinine prices yet the place is always full. I've been thinking about coming here for years but never wanted to deal with the crowd. Showed up at 11:00 a.m. on a Friday and decided to give it a try. I nearly instantly regretted the decision. We sat ourselves in the bar area which apparently isn't allowed, we were immediately scolded by a waitress that we weren't allowed to do that but since it was slow she would let it slide. Why inform us at all if you are going to serve us. I don't need to be told cheesecake bar-room adequate is different from the rest of the country if you aren't going to do anything about it. I apologize for seating myself at the bar, had you had a competent hostess I wouldn't have broken your unwritten bar rules. Needless to say I wasn't impressed with the service.  The food itself is what you can expect from a chain that doesn't have an executive chef. Frozen style meals heated up by minimum wage earning high school kids. A margarita pizza to them is frozen dough, with tomato sauce and a cheese stick chopped into pieces and barley melted. (Yes the same cheese sticks you buy at Safeway for your 3 year old child.) No one told them about basil apparently. Maybe you shouldn't have a menu of 200 items if you cant' remember what goes on each dish. How about specializing on 30 things you can do really well... Overall it doesn't matter morons will still dine at your establishment so whats the point of cooking good food. After lunch we waited 40 minutes with half full plates in front of us because our waitress forget about us when the lunch rush started. We expected this since she of course still blamed us for eating at the wrong table or something.  At the end of the day none of this matters. For some reason people still eat here in droves. Instead of reviewing the restaurant I should be shaming the fools that dine here. If you eat at the cheesecake factory you are disgracing American food. There are hundreds of places in the same vicinity that deserve your business. This establishment doesn't. I hope you don't make the same mistake I did and find a pleasant place to eat where the food is delicious, the staff is courteous and your hard earned dollars are supporting people that deserve it. I will never lower myself to the standards set by the cheesecake factory and eat here again.

67,Liz C.,"Santa Clara, CA",431,506,2328.0,3.0,2015-04-16,"Cheesecake Factory, specializes in cheesecake but offers a giant menu of entrees to choose from. I think it's easy for Cheesecake Factory to not have superb food because it doesn't necessarily specialize in one specific cuisine. It offers anything from pizza, burgers, salads, pastas, seafood, chicken dishes, etc. Despite having a huge menu selection, I still had a decent time here with my brother. We came around 5:30 on a Thursday evening and were seated right away. Around 6 pm is when a bunch of people started coming in and a line started to form so I recommend coming before 6 if you can. It gets even more crowded on Friday and weekend nights.  Mai tai - This is one of their most popular drinks. It's garnished prettily with a pineapple, orange slice and cherry. Make sure to stir the drink thoroughly. It has a nice ""tropical"" taste without tasting too much like fruit. You can taste the alcohol in here quite well, so if you like drinks that really mask the flavor of alcohol, I wouldn't recommend this one.  Fried calamari - For an appetizer we started with the calamari. It comes with two sauces: a garlic aioli type sauce and a cocktail like sauce. I think I preferred the garlic one over the cocktail one. The cocktail one seemed like it was missing a component in it, because the flavor just didn't deliver all the way. It tasted a bit more on the ketchup side. The garlic one was pretty good though. The calamari itself was just decent. The breading falls off too easily and it could have been fried a little longer. I think the squid wasn't very fresh, but the place doesn't specialize in seafood so I guess you can't expect the highest quality. Shepherd's pie - I've always heard of this dish and I've seen how it's made so it was finally time to try it. The dish is made up of ground beef, zucchini, carrots, and onions. It's then topped with mashed potatoes with a cheese ""crust."" The whole thing is smothered in mushroom gravy. Thankfully the mushroom gravy was not overly salty - which I appreciated. The mashed potatoes were tasty and I liked the cheese. It wasn't overly cheesy, which I had expected it to be. The ground beef was pretty dry though. Getting big chunks of dry beef wasn't that pleasant. Overall, the dish kind of tasted like salisbury steak. Huge portion, couldn't finish the entire thing. Spicy chicken chipotle pasta - My brother got this dish and enjoyed it. The pasta was cooked to al dente and I like the use of mini penne so that the sauce gets into the center. The sauce had a nice kick, but I felt like it was missing some sort of component that combined all the flavors together. The asparagus pieces and the little crunchy wonton strips add great texture to the dish. There are pieces of honey glazed chicken, but I think there were only around 3-4 pieces in the dish. It was decent, but could have been better. Another giant portion. White chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake - It was pretty good, but ever since having cheesecake from The Confectional, it doesn't compare. It wasn't as rich and creamy and velvety. However, the raspberry flavor was swirled beautifully in the cheesecake and it wasn't overly sweet. I didn't feel like my stomach was going to cave in from richness or anything. The chocolate crust added just enough chocolate to the cheesecake and went well with the white chocolate cheesecake base. Overall, a good dessert to end our meal. Service was good and attentive. Our waiter checked up on us, gave us lots of time and was very friendly. Not sure what service looks like on the weekend, but it was awesome tonight. The dishes are all around $15, but the portion sizes are huge so it may match their price. Cheesecake slices are around $8 per slice, but are also a pretty big slice that you can easily share. You also get free bread (dark bread and sourdough), which is a nice plus. Overall, not a bad place but the food could have been better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=60,3.04,3.31,3.212,2.8600000000000003,3.202

He told me he was there 10 minutes before I arrived. When I went to the host stand and said I was meeting someone, the hostess stared at me for a minute then said she didn't have anyone down for waiting for a guest. I asked her to look again, giving her my name and my friend's name. She acted put out and said she had nothing. I asked if I could look around. She glared at me then said fine but she knew he wasn't there. I walked around the restaurant and wasn't able to find him. I called his cell and texted him; no answer. I then went back to the host stand, gave the same girl my name and said I would like a table until I could connect with my friend. It was 5 pm on a Wednesday; a few people were waiting. She said I could wait for a table. After a few minutes, a waitress was yelling over the noise of the restaurant - it is ridiculously loud in here - ""party of 2"" over and over. No one responded because she didn't say a name. She then barreled over to me and angrily asked if I was waiting for a table and before I could answer, she demanded to know why I didn't give my name to the hostess. She showed me a ticket while doing this that didn't show a name. I said yes, I want a table and yes, I gave my name and my friend's name several times! Finally seated, I connected with my friend who told me he had put his name down for a table before going outside.  We had talked for 30 seconds when our waitress appeared, asking what we wanted to order. I told her we just sat down, give us 5 minutes. One minute later she was back. My friend hadn't opened his menu yet, telling me about his day. She came back one minute later so we both just picked something.  My friend got spaghetti and I ordered a salad. The food was just ok. The salad was a huge portion. I took half home. The waitress grabbed the plates while we were still eating, but we didn't say anything because we just wanted out of there.

The choreography, the furniture, the menus, the uniform, and many other things are most likely the same all over.  Wait time too.  Truthfully, I hate waiting for beepers to go off when I'm hungry.  I hate it even more when I have a hungry child nearby.  But the wait wasn't so bad - not even thirty minutes, and my child was swinging between hungry and nauseous, so we were kind of OK.  The ""server"" (I personally prefer waiter/waitress, and given my Information Technology background, ""server"" is hardware) was particularly courteous.  She quickly brought water and took our orders.  The orders arrived within a reasonable window, and were as ordered, nothing to be taken for granted lately.  Everyone at the table commented on the flavor and presentation of the food.  For me it was the pasta.  The pasta I had yesterday was closest to the pasta my grandmother used to make in her own kitchen from scratch.  I know, sounds incredible, not even possible.  How in the world can a chain restaurant afford to make their own pasta?  I have no idea.  But I can tell the difference between dried overcooked pasta and fresh thick, meaty and flavorful pasta.  I would have expected it at a small mom and pop Italian restaurant, but not at Cheesecake Factory.  I guess positive surprises are still possible. My grandmother passed away almost twenty years ago, and yet I can feel and taste the pasta she used to make in her own kitchen.  Yesterday's pasta at Cheesecake Factory was the closest ever.  Last but not least, our server was really nice and efficient, but I like Penny better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=280,3.32,3.29,3.248,3.124,3.302

155,Joni K.,"Seattle, WA",430,108,1971.0,1.0,2015-08-24,"My family and I had dinner at the Cheesecake Factory (Tukwila, WA location) for my cousin's 30th birthday Sunday, August 9th. We arrived around 7:30pm, and since the dinner crowd had died down, we were seated after about a 10 min wait which wasn't bad. We had seven (7) people in our party and three (3) of them were hungry children.  While the dinner rush was dying down, we literally saw our server at our table perhaps three (3) time out of the entire meal (twice I had to go to the front to track him down). We literally waited ten (10) minutes for our waiter to come take our drink order. Then we waited another fifteen (15) minutes for our drinks and starter bread. By that time, the kids were whiny and hungry.  Our dinner entrees took a long time to arrive so when it finally did, we were each excited as we were famished. I'm medically diagnosed as gluten-free and become highly ill when I am exposed to gluten. Therefore, when I placed my order, I communicated this to our waiter. He assured me that both mine and my spouse's gluten-free pasta dishes would be safe and explained that the dish would be served with a fusilli (corkscrew-like) pasta noodle. When our food arrived and after taking several bites of my gluten-free carbonara, I was highly disappointed to find that there was a spaghetti noodle in it. I tracked our server down and explained that since it was my cousin's birthday, I didn't want to cause a scene but wanted to confirm if the only gluten-free noodles they were serving was in fusilli.  My waiter confirmed that the only gluten-free noodles available were in the fusilli shape which is what he had served me and my spouse. I then informed him that there was a spaghetti noodle in my gluten-free pasta which basically meant that I was exposed to gluten and would now be getting sick. At that point, he almost robotically informed me that the meal would be deducted from my meal. Despite the lack of empathy, it was a nice attempt to try to resolve the matter. However, being medically allergic to gluten, his resolution did not comfort me as I now knew that I would be getting sick due to the lack of diligence.  After I had already explained to our waiter that I didn't want to disrupt my cousin's birthday celebration, the manager then arrives at the table to inquire about the meal. I pull him to the side and again, explained that it was my cousin's celebration so I'd prefer to speak with him away from the table. At that point, the manager, Steven, curtly tells me that he intended to come to the table to not only follow up on the status of my gluten-free meal, but to also check on everyone else as well. Steven then proceeded to tell me that since he was now only speaking to me, he wanted to tell me that, ""The kitchen takes celiac allergies very seriously. Out of everyone in the restaurant, you're the only one who has a regular noodle in their gluten-free meal."" I found his response to me was non-empathetic and unprofessional. I informed him that I had saved the noodle on the side of my plate and that if he was insinuating I was making it up, he could verify himself. He then told me he would like to make me a new meal or give me mine free. At that point, the kids were tired and exhausted from waiting forever for service and food and we all just wanted to go home. I politely told him that we had waited forever for service and food, that I wasn't happy that I was now going to become ill due to non-gluten-free meal. I asked him to please immediately have boxes sent to our table and also the birthday treat I had previously requested them to provide to my cousin.  After waiting another fifteen (15) minutes, I went to the front and again, tracked our server and asked for our boxes and check. As I was walking back to my table, I saw another gentleman speaking to the manager, Steven. The customer was obviously upset as I heard the customer tell Steven, ""It's not even about the bad food, but no one even apologized for their mistake."" Steven was disregarding this customer as he disregarded me. I left the restaurant exhausted, sick, and hungry. My cousin left without his birthday celebration treat and proceeded to wait another twenty (20) minutes in the ""To-go Cheesecake"" line to order his own birthday cake. By the time we left, it was around 10:30pm. Overall TERRIBLE TERRIBLE experience... bad service, lack of empathy and care with client food allergies, and non-empathetic management which I'm sure which all derives from the horrible ""lead by example"" leadership style exhibited by manager, Steven. This lack of leadership teaches his team to not care for their customers. I've ate here several times in previous years and I've never had a problem. If Steven continues to lead the team at this location, this restaurant will soon be unsuccessful. As customers who understand the true value of customer service and quality of food, will find it very easy to resort to dining at the next restaurant in the busy Southcenter mall area",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=140,2.96,3.24,3.228,2.6280000000000006,3.1280000000000006

(If you come before 5:30pm on the weekends, the wait is at least 5-10mins).  The customer service at this location is a hit or a miss. Sometimes your waiter is friendly and sometimes not so much, depending on who you get. When I went yesterday, our waiter was wonderful and helpful. I believe her name was Ronnie.  Our complimentary bread, drinks and food came out at a reasonable time.  I always get the Steak Diane and strawberry lemonade and it's always good.  The steak Diane comes with mushrooms and mash potatoes. It comes with a good portion at its price.  As for the strawberry lemonade, it's the best strawberry lemonade I've ever had. They give you a reasonable amount for the price as well.  I ordered to go food towards the end for my aunt and it came out right when i received the check.

Then he had the chicken tortilla soup which wasn't any way close to the tortilla soup we have ever had in California....this was a very thick tomato based soup that was pure yuk !

Since Marc really didn't eat much of it.  Service is ALWAYS good as is the food....so am not going to say that I will never return, cause I will.

Rest assured this location is no different than any of the others. You'll find solid service, consistent meals, quality and large portions. There's few better places for dates, celebrations, family meals or solo outings at the bar stool. This is one chain that always delivers. Why so many people give it average ratings has always surprised me. I'm guessing it's because the meals aren't dirt cheap. Meanwhile, what do you expect? With portions as big as they are and quality meals you get what you pay for. In fact, many eat half and take the rest home.  In fact, even the bread they bring to your table is better than many meals served by competitive chains, as is the passion tea. Another factory to consider is there is something for everyone here. On the other hand, a massive menu can't make it a chore to decide what to eat.

I always request that they split my pasta in 2 plates. This way my boyfriend can have his own plate while I attempt to save room for dessert... but still half a portion of the pasta made me full so I ended up taking my cheesecake to go.

My mother in law flagged down a manager and he ended up taking our drink order and bringing it to us. The waitress finally returned and took our meal order, which went smooth I guess. She seemed a little bewildered when one of our family members asked for his steak rare or medium rare and her response was ""you need to pick one as I have to push a button on the computer"" ...what? Haha. When our food came, our waitress was reminded that we had a birthday at our table. She ignored the request, and also ignored my request to get a glass of water. The manager finally noticed the birthday and when our cheesecake came they brought it out on a plate that said happy birthday with a candle which I thought was a nice touch. It was irritating that our waitress was so aloof, but what made me drop my review to only 2 stars was because when my boyfriend went to eat his leftovers the next day (pasta dish with chicken), his chicken was bloody in one chunk of it.

Since this locations has opened, I have visited it maybe four times.  All my visits the service has been okay.  I think the prices are a little high for food that I think is just okay - I've had better. On my recent visit, I realized how dark it is in the restaurant.  My friend and I had our flashlights out so we could read the menu.  We noticed other tables were doing the same thing.  I am beginning to dislike restaurants that are so dark that you need a flashlight to read the menu.  Do they keep it so dark because they don't want diners to see what they are actually eating? Besides being dark, the other thing I don't like about the Cheesecake Factory is how close they have the tables shoved together.  I was in a party of two and we were seated in a section that was nothing but a long line of tables for two that were spaced out a few inches apart.  When the hostess seated us, she seated us right next to an occupied table.  That would have been fine, except the party of two seated at the next table, instead of sitting across the table from each other for some reason had to sit on the same side of the table that is only meant for one person.  Since I was going to be sitting on the side where the two were sitting, I asked the hostess if we could sit at the empty table two down.  At first she said no, then as I was trying to squeeze in past the two dingbats, she came back and told us we could move. I have to wonder about the hostess because if she had any common sense she would have realized the two sitting on the same side of the table would make it difficult for the next table, but no she didn't because after my party and I moved down two tables, she seated another pair at the next table.   It will probably be a long time before I go back to the Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=340,3.12,3.07,3.26,2.7280000000000006,3.09

135,Thao N.,"Seattle, WA",1685,441,245.0,4.0,2015-12-28,"I love Cheesecake Factory. For some reason this always seem to be the surprise first date spot, birthday dinners, work party, or family get together celebration. It is a safe choice, a nice atmosphere with great food without going too overboard, plus it could be a restaurant that is family friendly for kids. They have a huge menu, it's pages and pages of options ranging from typical american dishes like steak, pasta, and burgers to Mexican and Asian fusion. Some of my favorite appetizers are the avocado eggrolls and Thai lettuce wraps. I heard the fried mac & cheese are a popular choice, but it might be too fattening for my taste. They didn't call it Cheesecake Factory for no reason, the cheesecake options are a menu itself. I've never seen this many choices, you have to try the red velvet cheesecake. If anything, the New York Style cheesecake is always a classic to have if you aren't adventurous in trying new things. You have complimentary bread when dining in, there's 2 kind that they give you;brown and white and let me tell you the brown is the shit, I think it's chocolate flavor. The best part? UNLIMITED bread, but don't get too hooked to it, you still need room for your food. All the entree seems to be huge portions so yay leftovers! Weekends and dinner time are always going to be busier, they don't take reservations on weekends. Watch out for homecoming or prom season because there tend to be large parties on the waiting list so that might delay your wait time. I was there when I was in grade school, it sucks on this end too to have to wait 2 hours to get a table that will hold that big of a party.

187,Shelby T.,"Los Angeles, CA",34,14,,4.0,2016-01-03,I had never been to a Cheesecake Factory and last minute on New Years night my boyfriend and I decided to try it as he had never been either. He got a very delicious fettuccine Alfredo while I got the spicy chipotle mayo crispy chicken sandwich. The sandwich was very good and would recommend it to chicken lovers. I also got the original cheesecake with strawberries on top. We saved that to take back to our hotel since we were quite full. When we tried it we realized they skimped out on the strawberries a bit since there were only 3. The only issue I have is with the price of the items on the menu in this restaurant. For the quality of food they're serving it could be a little cheaper. Could definitely get better fettuccine from Olive Garden for a better price.

Low: Small foyer/waiting area.  Food was a bit greasy.            This place seemed unusually busy for a Tuesday night when we ate here. But I was told that this was normal. With that said, I wish they had a better way/system for their customers to wait. The foyer where the customers are expected to wait is incredibly small & with the cheesecake bar sits right beside it, so it makes waiting a little clausterphobic. Though the front of the house wasn't rude-she was actually prompt and was making sure her tables were seating-she just didn't look happy to be there. Once we were seated though our sever was very quick, prompt and genuine. Additionally, when we needed extra bread, additional fork, etc., we flagged down the closest passing server/busser and they were all very eager to get our needs taken care of. The sense of urgency I felt the employees had made me feel important, regardless of the fact that they had a packed house. Our food came out shockingly fast considering how busy they were. All of the food tasted very good with American-sized portions, which made up for the higher prices. The pasta was good, but could've been a little more al dente. But I must admit that it was a little greasier than I had hoped.  Overall I would say that my experience at Cheesecake Factory was a pleasant one & will more than likely be returning to try out their other menu items...that tiramisu cheesecake was calling my name.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=80,3.2,3.15,3.228,3.152,3.17

We were seated for 20 minutes no water, no bread, no help at all. Finally 30-35 minutes of waiting the waiter came to our table asking what we wanted. We ordered our meals and said for dessert we want a cake. The first thing that came was our dessert. We said we wanted it later so the waiter suggested go pack it up. Which we didn't want at all. So we kept the cake on our table while we wanted for the food. Once we got our food everything was fine. Food was okay. The pizza my dad had was burnt. My brother had the Thai curry. I had the Chicken Bellagio. It tastes pretty good. Yet the service was really killing me...he was quick to give us the bill and pick it up which gave off a bad impression.

The wait was supposed to be 20 min but ended up being 35. That was the first red flag.  The second was we were seated under the vent with a cold draft at the end of January. Then we could barely hear each other due to the loud music and how busy it was.  Our waiter took our order and we barely saw him again. My husband got coffee and I had to get his attention just to get it refilled and to get bread for my son. I asked about singing for my daughter's bday and got oh yeah ok. When our food came 3 of us got ours and my husband had to wait 3 min to get his. My fries were cold and so were the sautéed mushrooms  on my burger. My husband's $26 rib eye was so salty he had to rub it off with water. Again our waiter wasn't even the one to bring our food so we had to ask the people who did for steak knives and tarter sauce. The tarter sauce was so bad I had to stop eating my meal. My daughter's steak was cold she also had the $26 rib eye. My daughter finally got her bday song as we got our check. We hardly saw our waiter ,David, but we saw him talking a lot and hardly working.  I will never return to this establishment.

This location is nothing short of par of a standard for chain restaurants.  When I do stop by and there's an extensive wait I'll either attempt to sit in the bar area (first come first serve) or I'll just leave so the wait has never bothered me.  I pick the right days (avoid weekends and no school nights) to visit and I'm typically sat within 5 minutes or less so that helps with my experience.  Considering I've been coming to TCF locations up and down the west coast for the past 13 years, the menu isn't daunting to me because I know what I want already, which helps.  Because if you are new - the menu is very much overwhelming with too many options for the indecisive to decide.  The have everything from every kind of pasta to beef carpaccio, vietnamese spring rolls to steak diane, mango salads to firecracker shrimp.  If that isn't enough to confuse you what to get, you'll have two pages of different desserts to choose from. My favorite part is the honey wheat bread and butter - delicious! My go to appetizer is the Luau Salad, fresh choke full of fruits and veggies topped with mangos and chicken, it really is a meal in itself.  The ahi tuna salad is also a great choice for healthy eats.  Main course wise, I haven't had anything that I hated, the jambalaya and fettucini are good go to dishes, meatloaf and the burrito are hefty portions and good flavor that can easily be divided by two.  I will say I wasn't a fan of the nachos, only because twice I ordered it and twice it came out dry, most likely due from sitting under a heat lamp waiting to be delivered.  Desserts are a tough choice but I'd have to pick the red velvet cheesecake, not over sweet but dances with that idea, the white chocolate shavings paired with vanilla bean ice cream and it's pure bliss.  My second choice is the strawberry shortcake, towering high of ice cream, shortcake, and ice cream - you can easily share any dessert or food portion with two to three folks and still have plenty to eat. Is it the best food ever? hardly.  Is it the cheapest eats you can find? far from it.  But thanks to the consistency of service and food and my experiences here I do like the place.  And will come back, most likely sooner than later.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=120,3.52,3.24,3.248,3.12,3.3520000000000008

Hence the fact this is the cheesecake factory! The apples I think were a little too crispy for my liking. But hey that is my personal preference. I stole bites of my guys cashew chicken, it of course is still my favorite... Not that the Bang bang chicken was bad. I might just keep it in rotation from time, to time.

I came on a Sunday so I expected it to be busy . After being told to it would be a 45 minute wait we were okay with it seeing that we can do a little shopping to past time by. I called within 30 minutes to see where my name was on the list since the pagers do not buzz anywhere further than the parking area around the restaurant. It turns out my name had been called and the hostess was nice and told us we will be next if we can come asap. Once arriving, we were seated within 5 min or so.. Our server didn't get to us until 10 minutes later . She dropped off some cold bread and ran off again for another 10 minutes. She came by asking for drinks and we all just wanted water . Once she came back we asked for warmer bread and to place our orders. She seem annoyed at our request and gave us a rude remark saying well I'll do by best what you get is what we have... The food came out it was okay...nothing special. When the server was taking away a few dishes she spilled water all over my friend . Seemed to be somewhat apologetic but more annoyed again. When I asked for a togo box the servers usually box the food but she just dropped the box off and took some plates and walked away . When we were finished we had asked for our bill and she wandered off for another good 10 minutes before getting our checks split. Once she ran our cards for the bill to be closed is when she started acting all nice.

351,Christina G.,"Seattle, WA",0,4,,1.0,2016-02-28,"The wait here is always insane.  The only reason we come here is because my daughter wanted their desert for her birthday.  We were quoted a 55 minute wait. After 50 minutes of waiting and seeing several parties our size that arrived after us get seated,  we struggled through the crowd to the podium to ask about how much longer.  We said  it's been about 50 minutes and wanted know about how much more, to then get the response from the hostess it has only been 47 minutes,  she insisted several times it was only 47 minutes and not 50. She was so rude,  what does about 50 minutes is so drastically different than 47 justified a hostess being so rude?  I found her to be just looking to argue,  I am sure she had a lot of pissy customers due to the ridiculous wait but I don't think how we asked her was in a rude manner or justified how she talked to us.  She then informed us it would  be 20 minutes more.  After waiting 25 more minutes,  I went to inquire to see how many more parties were ahead of us to then watch the hostess arguing with another customer about their wait time,  the customer hardly spoke as the hostess tried to put her in her place over the fact it hadn't been over an hour she had been waiting.  I guess I can take solace in the fact the time reprimand wasn't just for us.  After waiting an hour and 40 minutes we finally got buzzed.  Every one is now hungry and grumpy.  We agreed to be as positive as we could it's my daughters birthday and it's about her.  The food is not awesome especially for the cost or the wait.  My fish and chips order was fried shrimp,  even the food server said fish and chips as she handed me the shrimp. When I did get my fish and chips the tarter sauce was so hot from being under the heat lamp for too long.  Nothing appetizing about hot tartar sauce.   The waitstaff is the one highlight,  they were friendly and as quick as they can be with  the chaos and trying to get through the sea of people and orders.  Never again will I wait to be treated poorly and get sub par food,  I will get my daughter cheesecake to go if she really wants it (even though the takeout is crazy too)  at least it won't be almost 2 hours and a rude as hell hostess for sub par food at a  not worth it price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=340,3.48,3.22,3.252,2.8840000000000003,3.3240000000000007
319,Ariana D.,"Renton, WA",0,6,,1.0,2016-02-28,"This review is based solely on one experience- but this included an encounter with a manager that supposedly  claimed she had 43yrs of experience in this industry... however being a professional myself she did not exemplify quality customer service in fact the total opposite, until of course I called her back after we left the restaurant to inform her that I had called two Cheesecake Factory locations asking about the happy hour menu and pricing on drinks that were made as skinny drinks not until I told her that then she became very sweet and was trying very hard to apologize however still in the end she did nothing to compensate our bad experience. She did not even offer to pay us back our money for drinks that had been overcharged on her command to her bartenders.  The manager did not know that our bartender knows us as regulars and corrected the bill after Manager left-however the manager left thinking she overcharged us. She apparently did not know that skinny drinks or skinny versions of drinks on the happyhour are still happyhour priced items she kept on telling us that they were not happy hour prices. She repeated over and over on how happy hour drinks were only for the regular versions and she said that they have never offered the skinny drinks there is not even an option to do a skinny drink under the happyhour price so that's why I took things in my own hands and called to other locations asking about that and I was informed that they were the same price. We were very kind when she approached us at the bar and she automatically had this kind of wall defense up we were being super nice and we did not fight with her we simply told her that we are regulars and we have always ordered skinny drinks and they have always been charged as happyhour drinks she was basically telling us that no no that couldn't ever happened. We love the bartenders at Cheesecake Factory! That is why we go to happy hour with them because they are good people and they value our service and they always provide us with quality service! The manager is the one that messed it up for us. This managers name is CYNTHIA & if I knew any better those 43 years of industry work were spent at a Dennys not at a cheescakefactory no way with that customer service quality there is no way that she ever spent 43 years of cheescakefactory no absolute way!

But to ignore me, and bring me a salad with rancid dressing on it. Which I left sit on the table. I'm paying for the meal, why not LISTEN when I talk. I'm neither quiet, or easy to ignore. The server who took the order, didn't even bring it out. Our meal arrived staggered. Three different staff showed up, with one plate each.  When we needed something, I had to get up and find our server. NOT COOL. Check on us at least once, yeah?   When we asked for boxes to take the massive amounts of food home, the wait staff dumped my spouses pasta in her lap. Even after being told, "" Hey, that's too much to add to what you're carrying.""  The server had to be asked to bring a wet napkin to try to get the stain out. I expect better from this place. I really do. I've been here off an on over the last five years.  If I could use this forum to curse your server out, Cheesecake factory, I would. She should be fired for the way she treats your customers. We pay to eat here. Your opinion about what we eat, and what we order, should NEVER come out of your wait staff's mouth.

Not sure what took so long for me to write a review - but last nights dinner had me wanting to share in words - all about it!  I have generally found TCF's to have a cool decor with lots of seating & a pleasant staff to serve you. I like the design & lighting - vibrant, welcoming & relaxing! Oh yeah - it was finally the day I got my -catfish! You see I've been requesting this dish for my last 4 visits & they were always sold out! Even tried ordering it downtown Seattle & Bellevue locations - no luck! Regardless I was still happy with my backup order but longed for the day I would finally get my catfish!!! We ordered the Southern Fried Catfish & Sheila's Chicken & Avocado Salad. These were the best 2 dishes I've had yet. I made it a point to always try a new dish every time I ate @ TCF. I started this 2 years ago always looking forward to something new to eat from the menu! Ok so back to the Catfish! It was so great! I've had Catfish at Sylvia's in Harlem & it was comparable - as in equal & delicious! The Chicken Avocado salad was the best salad I've had ever in awhile - a absolute must for salad lovers! The Citrus-Honey-Peanut Vinaigrette was awesome - I loved it!  We had the very refreshing Strawberry Lemonade to drink - always a delight! I've had a few of their other drinks - try any & all out on your next visit! It's been awhile since I finished off my plate at TCF! In fact I can only recall always going back to the hotel with a doggie bag! This was not one of those times! I ate everything on my plate!!! Now to cheesecake - we took to go - Salted Caramel & Vanilla Bean cheesecake. Yummy!

Make sure you try to book ahead it possible. I was told 10 minutes for my party. It was only 5.  But for biggr parties or peak hours expect a 45 minute wait at least Amazing food choices. Get the Louisiana Cajun pasta or another hit like the steak Diane. I usually get the Americana burger or Cajun chicken littles. Big drink menu. Strong Mai Tais and Long Island iced teas. Can be a little loud but as the night winds down this is an awesome place to go for a quiet intimate setting.  They bring two types of bread for starters. Sourdough and sweet molasses. You'll always need a to go box though since portions are huge. Bathrooms a little small same with the tvs in the bar but this isn't really a bar place.  Also if you don't like big groups by you just ask to be reseated. I don't like big groups of teenagers or loud groups. I'm 25 and im mature for my age. I believe patrons can have a decent night out with out the interruptions. A couple of times I was seated by a big group and 2 guys kept standing up right next to my booth blocking my view and one almost knocked over a waitress.. So when I get here I usually request a table somewhere not in the open and they always accommodate which I love. For some reason I never see kids here.. I'm guessing it's more of a grownup restaurant Get a piece of cheesecake to go. Either ultimate red velvet or tuxedo. They see decadent. Don't know why this place gets a bad rap.

Our wait staff took forever to get to our table and it wasn't that busy around us so we had to wonder what was going on. Brought our drinks, then disappeared again as she forgot one. Took our orders and didn't see her again for another 20 min, where we finally got our bread. Had to ask for a refill at this time and again she disappears. Our food came out half hour later, all given to the wrong people but we sorted that out. One salad we never saw till the meal was over and she then asked if he still wanted it. Really? Had to ask for refills again...Everyone seems happy about the meal they received but my favorite was disappointing. Spicy cashew chicken was too sticky sweet, goopy with sauce and the quality of the rice has changed, being the cheap dried out version you get in Chinese restaurants. We asked if we could have a slice of cheesecake as a courtesy to our guest who never got their salad. Yes, no problem but again she disappears, so we paid our bill and had to walk up to the cheesecake counter and ask for it. Horrible, horrible service! Sadly, we came up from Portland and had so many choices on where to eat in this area. Will take a pass on it on the next visit. Oh, the salad was delivered to the table as we leave....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=280,3.04,3.38,3.292,2.3760000000000003,3.2440000000000007

98,Brittany S.,"Seattle, WA",0,27,5.0,2.0,2016-10-19,"Let me start out by saying, our food & drinks were amazing. We had avocado egg rolls for an appetizer. My husband had the chicken and biscuits for dinner, while I had the Renee's special. We also took 2 pieces of cheesecake home. If I could rate only the food and drinks it would have been 4-5 stars. Our service was absolutely terrible. Here is what we endured. It was our anniversary and we were sure going to celebrate like it was. Especially because we both work 12 hour days, go home to two wonderful kids and this mama is also in school. I asked my husband to grab a table in the bar and I would be over in a minute. When I came into the bar he was sitting down at a table instead of the high top. I asked him if he asked to sit there and he said ""Yes. I asked the server if it was okay if we seat ourselves here since a table opened up. He said it was okay and to let the host know. So, I did."" About 5 minutes later our server comes to the table and lectures us on how to be properly sat. Mind you, my husband had just had a conversation with him prior and what baffled me most is, it was 4:40 in the afternoon! And, the bar was only half full. The restaurant was nearly empty. I worked at one of the busiest restaurants in downtown Seattle for 5 years, I understand how to ask the host to be seated at a table, we aren't idiots. However, we brushed it off and ordered drinks.This was STRIKE ONE.. About 10 minutes later he comes back to the table, I ask if we can order an appetizer and bread. He responds, ""Well, I haven't even made it to the kitchen yet or I would have grabbed some."" His eyes rolled so far into the back of his head, I thought he was going to pass out. Now, I'm starting to get irritated. STRIKE TWO. We had planned to move into the restaurant at this point but he came back with what we thought was an attitude check and some bread. About an hour and so later I asked to order my 4th glass of wine. Mind you, my third one was still full but I wanted to get it at happy hour price before happy hour ended. The server looks at me in shock, as if i'm belligerent at the table and says, ""Well, who is driving!?"" I pointed to my husband. As the server walked away I nearly burst in to tears. I rarely ever enjoy myself like this but it was our anniversary, I wasn't driving. To the server, i'm sorry if it baffles you I can drink a whole bottle of wine in an evening and still be responsible. STRIKE THREE. My husband went to talk to the manager who completely BRUSHED OFF his frustrations and said, ""I'm sorry. He's kind of an awkward guy but hes been here a long time."" Nothing like, ""Let me grab you another server and take care of some of your bill."" ""How can I fix this for you?"" ""I'm so sorry. I will speak with him about this privately, immediately."" The manager said it is protocol to make sure someone isn't drunk driving, which I have zero issue with. If he would have said, ""Maam, it is protocol that I make sure after drink ""1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,910"" you aren't driving or order you a cab."" STRIKE FOUR. After working in the service industry for 5 years, I found this service one of the worst i've received. There was numerous eye rolling, judging, frustrations, ext. But, I don't have the time to write out every single thing that happened in our 2.5 hours of dining. Over 100.00 bill. And, I wish we would have just eaten at Subway!

94,Roxanne W.,"Auburn, WA",49,10,3.0,1.0,2016-12-04,"Okay long review here, but honestly you have to know how I originally viewed this restaurant to get an idea of how disappointed I am. The first time we ate @ CF I ordered their Farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic and my husband ordered the Steak Diane & herb crusted salmon combo. LOVED IT!!! It was amazing and perfect! This was at the Seattle location in 2008. Following this wonderful experience we visited the Tukwila Location (it's closer to home). The first visit to TL was great! Semi same customer service, food was awesome, everything was great! We have brought tons of family and friends to CF over the last 8 years and there were times that the meal didn't have enough sauce or wasn't cooked correctly, but typically the issues have been little with no need to complain. We would chalk it up to them being busy or it was an accident kind of thing. (I get the same thing every time though, so I know how it's supposed to taste...)  My previous visit I got my food to go. Got home, ate my meal, and went to take a long awaited bite of my amazing cheesecake. As I pulled the first fork-full away it was still connected by a hair baked into the cheesecake! YUK! I thought awe man!!! And I kept it in our fridge for a good 2-3 weeks thinking I was going to make time to bring it in and show them that it was actually coming out of the cake itself. But I never got around to going and figured I would just say something about it when I went in next. When we got there is when I told the gal that my cheesecake had hair in it last time I took a to-go cake. Her response was to ask if I called in and as I said no and started to explain to her my reasoning. She interrupted me and said I wish you would have called. At that point I just asked for a manager. Who wants to pay $7-$9 for a piece of cheesecake and throw it in the garbage!?!?!? NOT ME!!!! When the manager gets to the table she says the same thing, of course, that the waitress said. And says to call next time. Doesn't want to listen to what I have to say, but sure does want me to listen to her....  She says, 'The reason we ask for a call right away is so we can 'coach' our people and if they aren't wearing a hair net when working then we can make sure they do in the future. I'll go ahead and comp one for you today, but we could have sent you another piece right away if you would have called.'  I said, 'Oh that's awesome! I wasn't aware that they would have mailed one out. Okay, that makes sense. I will call next time. Didn't think it was that big of a deal.' (She then INTERRUPTS me and says something while also mentioning that their cheesecake is not baked in house.) My response to that was, 'how are you going to coach someone that doesn't work for you? I believe I have the same gift card that I used to purchase my meal and cheesecake with me if you would like to use the paper trail to figure out who was working that day, but it doesn't matter because it was baked into the cheesecake it wasn't on the cheesecake.' Terrible customer service. Neither of these two ladies expressed any empathy to finding hair in my food. I have worked in customer service for 12 years. I know how it can be and I give the benefit of the doubt more often than not. But yesterday was the last straw. **We will NEVER GO TO THE TUKWILA ONE AGAIN!!!!** 12/3/16 marks the SECOND time (in a row) that I've gone home with leftovers that I pulled hair that IS NOT FROM ONE OF MY FAMILY MEMBERS out of my food!!!! I am beyond irritated that I drove 45 minutes to spend $75 to eat dinner with these outcomes: Waited over an hr AT the table for our food, after waiting over 30 mins for a table. Which I would have overlooked, however, my husbands steak and potatoes came out 'luke warm' and now I have to throw mine away AGAIN! Even after all that we still gave a 20% tip!! There was no hair in my food when it arrived at the table. I will chalk up the problem to letting the waitress take my food back to the kitchen to stick it in the to go container.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=80,3.04,3.37,3.276,2.244,3.238

The wait to be seated was fine, but the timeliness from our waiter was less than decent. We were never offered drink or water refills, nor did our waitress offer bread while we waited for our food. A food runner delivered our food, and immediately we realized we were missing items. The staff didn't apologize, but at least we got our food. The three cheese pasta and Thai wraps were good, but we were particularly disappointed in the $7 asparagus, which is advertised as ""grilled,"" but had simply been boiled and thrown on a plate without seasoning, butter, or any flavor all. We also asked for some sides that never came, and by the time our waitress returned to our table it was pointless to remind her, as we had been there for nearly two hours, and were ready to leave.

I always order a Blue Hawaiian wherever I go and it was made perfectly.  We waited about 15 minutes or less for our food. I ordered a nice bowl is spaghetti with red meat sauce.

105,Amanda S.,"Cheney, WA",2,12,6.0,5.0,2017-02-13,"I love The Cheesecake Factory, it is my favorite restaurant. This location in particular is the best one IMO. The wait times can be pretty long and they don't take reservations, but it's so worth it! They have so many options for anyone, including vegetarian and vegan options. I used to always get the Chicken Bellagio or Shrimp Scampi, and never (at this location) has my food come back wrong, bad, or in any way not to standards. My waiter/waitress is always awesome, friendly, and attentive (shout out to Chris, she's awesome.) Now that I'm vegetarian, I try some different pasta dishes when I come here. So far my favorite is the tomato basil pasta with no chicken. All of their dishes are very flavorful and filling. They have huge portions for the prices on the menu. It can be a little loud, but that's because it's always busy. It's good for kids and it's great for a date night or just a dinner stop on your way home (they have a car side to go program.) For dessert, they have 2 full pages of different kinds of cheesecake to choose from. You can always come here and have a complete unique dining experience every time. The slices of cheesecake are fair in size and perfect for sharing. If you aren't a Cheesecake person, they have other kinds of cake and ice creams and pies to choose from as well.

131,Edie S.,"Tacoma, WA",2,19,13.0,1.0,2017-03-27,"The description of this restaurant lies: they DO NOT take reservations.  We wanted to take my son and his family out for 4 birthdays that all happen within two weeks of each other. There were 7 ""full size"" people and a 4 month old baby. I called to make reservations and was told they didn't take them. They said the wait would probably be more than 30 minutes. Since I already told my son we would meet them there my husband and I went there to check what the wait would be. They didn't lie about the time. The parking lot and the entry to the restaurant was packed so it didn't look promising. I asked the hostess how long it would be. She wanted my name immediately, put it into the system, then I was told she had to check with the manager for how long on bigger parties. She just stood there so I said, okay are you going to check? She turned to someone else who went off toward the kitchen. I waited for several minutes more. I was never given one of the beeper things so I had to just stand there. I finally asked where the manager was and she finally turned to a man who had come into the hostess station a minute before and then he came and told me it would be 50 minutes. We decided that was too long to wait with a baby and 3 other kids under 12. I said it was very unfortunate that they don't take reservations. One hostess agreed and the manager ignored me. I made sure that he heard me. I asked if it was a store policy or corporate, and he said corporate. The corporate page says that some stores do take reservations for large parties. The manager was less than friendly. I'm sure they don't care because they are obviously busy enough but it would make for a much more enjoyable experience to be able to have a shorter wait with a less crowded waiting area if they actually did take reservations. We went to another restaurant close by and got in immediately.

The menu selection is always enormous and there seems to be way too much on the menu to pick through.  It was hard to choose what to eat and I ended up picking the Pit Beef Dip sandwich which was mainly a roast beef sandwich with melted cheese and caramelized onions. The sandwich was very tasty especially after dipping in the au jus. It was flavorful and the beef wasn't overcooked as some are usually. The serving size was big as usual and I had to doggie bag some to bring home. The fries were a great side item and they had a good crunch to them from being deep fried. I also tried their key lime cheesecake which is one of my favorites as it has a good tartness to it and with the added whip cream on the side, it really complements each other. The serving size is always a good amount and there is no way I can ever finish one after a whole meal. The service here was good as we had prompt service by our waitress even though the place was totally packed and she got our drink orders out quickly. The food took a bit longer to get to us, but with how busy the place was I could understand it could take awhile.

The servers are all friendly and they seem to help each other out a lot.  One question though, why are the floors always a little slippery, seems dangerous lol.  Anyway, great food here, good service and you can't beat the mall location.

I had picked up 2 slices of cheesecake 20 minutes prior. On my way home I realized that I had left my wallet at the counter where you get the cheesecakes and the to go orders. I called the restaurant and said I would be on my way to get it. This was at 4:45 p.m. I walked into the restaurant at 5 p.m. there was a line but it wasn't as busy as they usually get, either way I was here to pick up an item that I left and had called ahead for.  I went up and told them I had called about my wallet that I had left and was told that it would be a moment. Ok no problem.  15 minutes later cut to me watching three 2 tops, one 3 top and a baby, one true 4 top and then a 9 top get seated! We NOW have a problem. I approached the hostess stand. She looked me in the face and asked if she could help me. I told her that I could come back for my wallet tomorrow if that would help them out. Then the light bulb went on and she remembered. She told me a manager had to go and get it. I said great! She never told the manager because I saw him run into the bar, mess with the seating chart system, share a joke with a group that wanted to sit outside, run over to the bakery counter side then back to the hostess stand then over to a section with the servers. I have worked in restaurants and have owned a bar. I understand how hectic change of shift coupled with ""happy hour"" can be, but I also know that I need to treat paying and already paid customers the same. Like they matter!!  After another 10 minutes when the 8 top got seated that is when I glared at the hostess and mouthed ""wallet"".  Only then did she run over to the manager. I ran out to my car to get my phone and call the corporate office. When I walked back into the restaurant the manager had my wallet and ""thanked"" me for waiting. I am not an idiot I know that going to a cheesecake factory means waiting to get seated, waiting to order and waiting to eat, but when I call ahead of time for a left item there should be little to no wait!

Well, think again. The restaurant just opened. It was empty. We were one of the first people in the door. You would think we would be seated right away. But NO. TCF has a policy of not seating people if they did not have enough servers. Not enough servers as they opened their doors. They should not open the restaurant if they were not fully staffed. We had to stand around and wait 30 minutes for enough servers to be seated. Just to be seated, mind you. Not even to be served. I have never heard of such a ridiculous policy. We had tried to make reservations, but were told they did not take reservations. At the restaurant, we were asked if we had made reservations. We were advised to make reservations  if there were so many people in our party. It was as if they did not want our business or even cared if we gave them our business. There are a bazillion restaurants to go to. There is nothing special about The Cheesecake Factory that I could see or discern. Given that it is a popular restaurant.  We were treated like unwelcome guests. I am never going to The Cheesecake Factory ever again - even if someone else was picking up the bill. The food is adequate. Nothing spectacular. What a great disappointment. I would have given it zero stars if at all possible. One star is the lowest. NOT RECOMMENDED. YOU ARE NOT WELCOME OR TREATED AS VALUED GUEST.

46,Christopher N.,"Seattle, WA",71,68,84.0,3.0,2017-10-25,"I reference how I'm not that smart often, and now I'm going to tell you a story on how I know this. A few years ago a coworkers's wife sent him to work with a cheesecake. She's an amazing cook/baker/all around kitchen whiz, so it was delicious. Now, I've always loved cheesecake from the Jello instant to something you'd get at a high end bakery. I innocently asked him how its made, and to my shock (and disgust) I learned the filling is made with cream cheese. I was floored. It was like my head was getting sucked into a black hole. I thought the ""cheese,"" in the name was a play on words. Plus, I never considered cream cheese to be cheese. Its a man made product much like Chili's Burger Meat (shots fired). I've never looked at or had cheese cake since. Its rather quite tragic. In fact, thinking about it is bringing back bad feelings. Is it happy hour yet? I went to The Cheesecake Factory ten years ago in California. Because i'm dumb, I ate hot pasta, outside, on a blazing day that made it less than memorable. I think Seattle's dark, and rainy days is a more apt setting. Isn't it cuffing season, so we're allowed to start putting on a few pounds? With that said, I've never really  had a high opinion about the joint. I always thought it was a chain restaurant that dumb people go to thinking that they're getting fine dinning. Well, friends visited recently, and they insisted on going. I can call them dumb, cause I know they don't read but in the case that they're reading this, ""One Love,"" as the great Nasir Jones once said. I was pleasantly surprised to some extent on our visit. The main entree was pretty good (Four Cheese Ravioli/Pasta). Generously portioned, very cheesy, and the sauce was pleasant. We also ordered two appetizers that were less than memorable. One was what I assumed was going to be an empanada, but was more a breaded cheese stick. The other was so unmemorable that I even forget what it was. Don't be fooled by the name of the apps, or my words...I did eat them a couple of days later when I was drunk.  The service was great though. We sat at the bar, and the bartender/server was fast, courteous, and bagged up our leftovers like a pro. She even let me not have a giant napkin in front of me as I ensured her that I wasn't some animal who can't keep the food on the plate.  I'm on the fence with this place, but I can see why some people like it. Its good for large groups, and people who like a wide range of options. The food is decent, but nothing extraordinary. I imagine I'll probably have to take my parents here on their next visit since they're not adventurous eaters (hey, they're old, and didn't grow up watching Bourdain taint their minds, and pallets). Its a solid option if you're in the area, so I won't judge...too much. Salute!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2,2.48,3.0,3.136,,2.7920000000000003
43,Christine M.,"Renton, WA",364,47,134.0,3.0,2017-10-27,"Don't you hate running into a restaurant an hour before closing on a week night? Knowing you're going to order appetizers, drinks, entrees, and desserts because you haven't consumed anything but caffeine for the past 10 hours? Hoping not to stress your waitress because you empathize with her long work hours? We were that couple a couple nights ago.  I'm not one who enjoys browsing a 100+ item menu, so I ordered from the designated Specialties list crafted specifically for people like myself. The crunchy pineapple chicken and shrimp was the best choice I'd made all day. I was once again a pest with the waitress and asked for a ""no cilantro"" accommodation which made the dish perfect. I couldn't see myself enjoying the mounds of fresh basil alongside it. My fiancé's grilled salmon was cooked to perfection, and the sautéed spinach along side it was a nice touch. The mashed potatoes leave little to be desired.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2,2.44,3.0,3.132,,2.7760000000000002
44,Reba H.,"Renton, WA",245,133,419.0,2.0,2017-10-27,"For the last three years my husband and I have dined at the Cheesecake Factory with our children because it has been a kid-friendly restaurant. Recently we noticed a shift in the service. Unfortunately, the wait staff seems to be getting younger and more inexperienced. I am not kidding when I tell you what happened to us last night. Hold on to your seat. So yesterday my family and I came to the Cheesecake Factory for dinner. I guess you can also call it an escape from the kitchen for a night. Well we arrived at the Cheesecake Factory around 7pm to the usual 20-minute wait. That went by pretty quickly considering the first bathroom trip with two children. When we were seated we ordered our food pretty quickly we're familiar with the menu. There is a lot of options at this restaurant heads up. I would recommend if it's your first visit check out the website and get an idea of what you want to order before you show up because there are many many options. We ordered the spicy nuggets and grilled cheese with bacon for appetizers. I wouldn't recommend either one of those to be honest. Then we ordered side salads, the countryside side catfish, and a pasta for my husband. The catfish was okay, tastes a little bit like chicken but it was a decent dish. My husband's pasta noodles are sticking together in a seriously huge clump and served a bit cold as though it had been sitting and waiting for a long time. One of the servers knocked my glasses off of the table spilling it into my lap and then crashing it down to the floor and breaking into pieces and cutting my ankle. After this occurred the server walked off and said let me grab my manager. My husband's response was to ask him for a Band-Aid and a cloth before doing so. The manager came and sort of checked out our moods I believe to see if we were going to cause a big fuss about it. Which we weren't we have children we understand that accidents happen. They gave me a Band-Aid and took my drink off the order. Which I was puzzled about. It was polite for them take the drink off the bill, however, I'm sitting there with my ankle bleeding and my lap wet and it didn't seem as though this was anything out of the usual for them. It was very odd it seemed as though they have issues like this all the time because it was kind of just back to business as usual. No fuss at all. And I don't remember a time I've ever gone out to a restaurant and left bleeding with a Band-Aid. It was just an interesting night to say the least but we've decided not to come back. I make a slammin dessert and it's just a mess there. And I mean that literally like the table and the seats were dirty they just need to get it together at this point.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2,2.36,2.97,3.136,,2.726

51,Keisha S.,"Redmond, WA",0,21,,2.0,2017-12-12,The Cheesecake Factory varies from location to location by a lot. It's surprises me a large chain can have so much variance. Service and quality here is suspect. My boo and I got over and under cooked food. I had order a steak well done and he had ordered med rare. His was way closer to well done and mine was still a little pink. We both ordered different steaks so either the waitress or the cook goofed. At least the appetizers were good. I didn't want to complain we just finished our food day left. I didnt feel like waiting for them to re do everything since it was busy and we had to wait a while already. It was more I wanted to go asap. The whole vibe just didn't go too well for me. Plus I wasn't too thrilled with our waitress anyway.  This Factory was the one at South center mall. I usually eat at the Bellevue one and Come to think of it I should write something good for them.

Not only that, she didn't even know i paid. Then she offered free cheese cake and didn't come back till 15 mins later with my food. Off I went to later find out I didn't even get cheesecake.

41,Kelsy T.,"Renton, WA",0,11,5.0,3.0,2017-12-28,"Like: rose-colored glasses that don't work anymore  When we first went to Cheesecake Factory, there were these sorts of expectations surrounding it. It is a bit pricey ($7ish for a bowl of strawberries??) and so we've always thought of it as the kind of place you'd go to for special occasions. The look of it all also made it seem a bit more high-end than your average American restaurant.  If you looked at the menu, there are an abundance of choices ranging from pasta to seafood to steak. There are even Asian choices that my little Asian self was kind of wary of. As time went on however, like those rose-colored glasses, it didn't seem as high-end as it used to.  I think there's this sort of feeling you get when you find yourself in a space where you've already painted a picture of it in your mind. Since I thought of Cheesecake Factory as this high-end, for special occasions, kind of place, no matter how the food tasted, that thought still stuck. But once you grow older, you realize that it can't always be like that.  Mind you, there are a lot of good food at Cheesecake Factory. The sliders are pretty good and their New Orleans Shrimp was a fave.  But then there is the buffalo chicken tenders that looked as if they hastily threw on some sauce while leaving some with barely any of it. There is the Steak Diane that wasn't necessarily bad but left some to be desired and the Chicken Bellagio that was kind of bland? Among a few more, there is also the Skinnylicious Chicken Pasta with pasta that wasn't cooked enough and a strand of fettuccine here with another penne there.   The cheesecake in which this restaurant is famously named, is great, but the size of it grows relatively smaller with what seems like every visit. In contrast, the price sees an increase. I'm not sure if it's worth it and don't buy a cheesecake every time anymore.  I'm sure one can find a dish that they like at Cheesecake Factory but with all the things we've tried, I can't say it leaves much in the desire to try new things.  It's still expensive for a restaurant to frequent often so I wouldn't recommend it if you were looking for a cheap place to eat at and I would just say that it is really just your average American restaurant (with a wider open space). Recommended for: generally anyone for the first time, I recommend you try it out at least once. Who knows? You might find that there is one dish that will keep you coming back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2,2.44,2.87,3.124,,2.6980000000000004

The wait time is a given, this place is popular with good eats. They estimate a longer wait but generally I've always been seated sooner. Recently, it seems that this place has really gone down in service. I wonder if some of these servers are even trained. We got sat in the Octagon aka the forgotten section. We asked Brandon to bring out the appetizer before the main course (this is actually a no brainer) however he explained that how the system works is, you put in the order and it all comes at the same time. Made no sense to me as I've waited before and I know that you can time your courses. He never put in the order for the appetizer so it never came anyway. Steak was well done and not medium-well as ordered. Pasta was Luke warm. It was probably sitting for a while. We would have told the server this had he come back to do a quality check. He pawned us off to another waitress who was just as bad. I looked around our whole section and everyone seemed to be having a poor experience. Lesson learned, don't get sat in the octagon.
