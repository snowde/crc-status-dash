115,Lauren D.,"Tulsa, OK",634,292,895.0,4.0,2012-05-22,"Yummiest cheesecake around, besides my moms of course. The atmosphere and service at this restaurant are great! The menu boasts 14 pages of tasty drinks and foods, but in my opinion it is like reading a mini novel. Not complaining about too many choices, but it makes it hard to decide what to order. We started with the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps, and looking back on it this was my favorite dish of the meal excluding the cheesecake. For our second appetizer we tried the tuna steak (cannot remember the exact name of the dish) and it was awesome too. I had the shrimp fettucini alfredo and my husband had the filet. Both were very yummy; I always make a point to try his dish too to get some variety. All in all, it is a great restaurant. I would warn that it is a bit on the pricey side and it is not an eat and run kind of place (we were there a total of 2 or 2 1/2 hours). It is also great to just stop in and grab some cheesecake to go though!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tulsa?start=80,3.248,3.248,3.248,3.248,3.248

61,Shannon B.,"Phoenix, AZ",179,274,252.0,2.0,2012-07-06,"If you have a large group and some picky eaters with you, Cheesecake Factory has everything!  I've been to several CFs and am not really a fan of their non-specialty menu. I feel like if a restaurant wants to do something really great, it will narrow down its options, but that's just my opinion.   Do NOT order salad at CF! They are totally worthless and not worth the $9-10 or whatever the cost is. I don't know why I don't remember this each time. If you order any type of salad, it appears huge...it's mostly filled with maybe 3-4 cups of iceberg/some romaine lettuce. Whatever the salad was advertised as (i.e. roasted veg, chicken, etc), that particular topping might be in the quantity of 1/8 to 1/4 cup. So you're paying for iceberg lettuce.   My mom ordered some chicken tacos from their SkinnyLicious (or whatever it's called) menu and enjoyed them.  Besides my crappy salad that was maybe 100 calories and did not fill me up, I ordered an egg, tomato and English muffin. The eggs appeared to be powdered eggs (that odd yellow color), but I could be wrong. The tomato was surprisingly good for a chain restaurant and muffin just OK.  Everything I've eaten here on this visit and others is just OK.  I've ordered the Vietnamese spring rolls wasn't all that impressed. IMO, the cheesecake is too waxy and I prefer homemade. The service, however, was great.

We were one of the first groups to come into the restaurant for the day.  If you have never been to The Cheesecake Factory, be prepared--the menu is HUGE.  I don't know how they fit everything on there.  In my opinion, they should make the menu smaller and eliminate some of the items that are not as popular.  We took advantage of the lunch menu.  The size of the meal is smaller and so is the price. Our plan was to have a small lunch and finish with some cheesecake.  The lunch sized items were still large enough to fill us up and we were unable to eat another bite.  No cheesecake for us, unfortunately!  We would have taken some to go, but did not know if we would be able to check into our hotel to use the refrigerator in our room.  Split a meal with someone and then get the cheesecake.  That's what we will do next time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tulsa?start=60,3.64,3.64,3.64,3.2800000000000002,3.6400000000000006

The Cheesecake Factory does a nice job of having a variety of menu items and does them well - even the pasta is cooked acceptably.   As far as the Cheesecake...I am not sure I've ever had it. Famous for their crazily caloric portions, I'm not sure how one leaves room for desert at this establishment. They all look good and there is an amazing variety.  Maybe everyone orders off the ""skinny"" menu and saves room that way? I give props to them for creating a menu of lighter, healthier options, but honestly I didn't look at that menu. I don't go to an establishment like this to eat baked chicken or steamed fish. Did I mention the portions are enormous? The crab wontons are delicious and easily enough for a table of four.  The Louisiana Chicken Pasta is quite yummy - parmesan breaded chicken, spicy creamy sauce, and bow tie pasta with peppers, what's not to like? Get ready for a to go box and lunch the next day! Items like the chicken tacos are also yummy...honestly, there are so many items on this menu you'd have to be a hardcore regular to try them all.  One of these days, I'm going to get a cheesecake to go, just so I can feel like I had the whole experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tulsa?start=40,3.76,3.76,3.76,3.2800000000000002,3.76

I find myself wanting to try something different on their menu but I keep going back to the same thing! Their sirloin is very juicy and tender..Their loaded mashed potatoes is delicious, and you get two types of breads upon your entire visit, one is sourdough and the other is wheat bread. If you haven't tried their fried macaroni balls then you should definitely ask for them. They are quite large and you get 4 on a plate with an excellent type of marinara sauce. It's not a cheap restaurant at all. My fiance & I both get the same thing (sirloin steak, mashed potatoes, and the macaroni appetizer and our bill is usually $60 (without tip) and if we both get 1 slice of cheesecake each then it runs around $70-$80 Reason i'm rating this a 4 star is because i am a fan of this restaurant, their food is amazing and the staff is always nice and the overall appearance of the place is nice and clean. The 5th star it's lacking is the price, there's not a lot of decent places that have great food and service quite like the cheesecake factory, but it's hard to go when your on a tight budget.

First of all, there is always a wait. I went on a Saturday at 5pm and still had to wait, but it was only for 10 minutes. The wait is worth it though. The huge menu can be overwhelming for some. If I came here more often I would venture out and try new things, but I usually stick to my favorites-pasta or chicken. The crispy chicken costeletta is one of my faves! Crispy chicken with a lemon butter sauce served with mashed potatoes and asparagus. It's a huge portion too. You can definitely take home half of it for another meal. My favorite appetizer is the chicken samosas. They have a large variety of small plates and appetizers. I plan on trying a few next time instead of one entree.  Now for the cheesecake. The pumpkin cheesecake is back for the season. It is amazing! It's creamy and spicy and the whipped cream on top is the perfect finish. I have to say I've never had a bad piece of cheesecake there. The white chocolate raspberry is delicious and fruity, but the Hershey's Chocolate Bar is one of the best. I can't eat a whole slice by myself because it is so rich, but it's nice to share with someone. My husband and I usually get a slice each and share. Now I'm craving cheesecake for lunch. Too bad it's so far away from me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tulsa?start=60,3.68,3.68,3.68,3.572,3.6800000000000006

Both tasted very good despite the warmth. Our waitress refilled our drinks very frequently, but barely spoke a word. About two bites into our cheesecake, she dropped off our bill and said ""no rush"" in a tone that sounded quite agitated.

It seems that most of the time when places have such a large menu, it isn't good. However, the majority of things I have tried here (between a lot of locations) have been good. I have a few things that I stick with because I really like them, such as the salmon salad and Baja chicken tacos. This past time I ordered the Baja chicken tacos and will admit the rice and beans were different and were not good, so that is a bummer, but it has normally been good.

32,John J.,"Tulsa, OK",130,161,36.0,3.0,2016-07-24,"I don't have anything in particular against The Cheesecake Factory, but I do think that it's extremely overrated. This restaurant is located on the outer ring around the parking lot at Woodland Hills Mall. It's typically very crowded and the seating is nothing special - quite a few tables have booth on one side and chairs on the other. We were very close to the table next to us and didn't really care to hear every word of their conversation or their children screaming. That being said, the food tastes very, very good. You can order a lot of different foods because it's an extensive menu and I've yet to eat something I didn't like. However, most of the food is exceptionally bad for you so I feel like it's cheating in a sense (give me some butter, sugar, and huge portions and I can make you something good, too). This establishment just seems bad for society. It's generally overpriced and I'm kind of surprised people consider this to be a fancy or nice restaurant - again, it's OK but you can find much better food in Tulsa for a better price. In closing, this restaurant is fine but there are many better options. The food and service are very good, but this isn't a particularly special dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tulsa,4.12,4.12,4.12,2.9240000000000004,4.12

I love the avocado egg rolls. Always have! They are amazing. If you love avocado, try them. They are wonderful.  I got a Raspberry lemonade to drink and it was ok. I wont order it again. It was extremely sweet and not to my liking, but I'm sure some would love it!  My husband and I got the tostada chicken salad to share and it was delicious. It was HUGE. I usually go with the bang bang chicken, but was looking for a lighter option and this certainly didn't disappoint. We really liked it, but next time I would get the dressing on the side so we could save the leftovers, because there will always be leftovers.  Last, the best part, the cheesecake. I am not a cheesecake fan, but the cookie dough cheesecake if one of my very favorite desserts. That's why I give four stars. Because I seriously LOVE it. It may be because it's basically a slice of cookie dough with bits of cheesecake, but, either way, it's wonderful.

She said she has a two year old and finds a plate of chopped fruit settles her kid down and could she bring us some? She was so nonjudgemental and kind, and it worked like a charm.
