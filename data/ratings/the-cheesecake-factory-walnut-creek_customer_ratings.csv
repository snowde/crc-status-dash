1044,Nathan V.,"Antioch, CA",0,5,,5.0,2012-01-12,"This rating and review is NOT about the restaurant as a whole.  It is about the single performance of one waiter at the Cheesecake Factory in Walnut Creek.  The waiter is named Miguel, and he is by far one of the best waiters I have had the pleasure of dining with.  I work in food service training and I often take the opportunity to keep a waiter or waitress on their toes - no matter where I dine. So, what did he do?  Well, first I must explain what his supporting staff did not do...  Dinner was delivered with mistakes in side dishes, entree ingredients, and although additional condiments were requested - the requests were not honored.     Miguel bent over backwards, running back and forth, collecting missing side dishes, providing additional condiments, and even replacing bent silverware.  All the time I pressed this guy harder and harder (because that's what I do for a living) and not only did he correct a mass of chaos that he did not create, he did it despite my ever increasing disapproval.  What's really impressive?  He never lost his composure, or his sense of diligence, and he maintained the integrity of our dining experience. Now, like I said, I pressed this guy hard enough to make him want me to leave and never come back.  This is what Miguel said to me when we were leaving, ""Please ask for me next time you come in so that they can seat you in a place where I can serve you."" Easily, one of the best waiters I have ever seen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=800,3.56,3.31,3.192,3.22,3.41

990,Tamara A.,"Concord, CA",12,11,5.0,2.0,2012-02-06,"We waited 2hrs for a table which was 30 mins longer than we were told. When we went to the waitstaff and asked how much longer, they acted as if they had already seated us but we were standing in front of them. They looked at their chart and then back at me and said, we have table that is just about ready for you. We were seated in the back corner of the restaurant which was fine but as our friends 3 yr old climbed into the booth she slipped and hit her head. The waitress just stood there. No offer of ""would you like ice or a cold pack"", or even ""is she ok"" or ""the tile can be slippery"". Maybe I am just asking for too much but read on as the evening get's better.  We began to order appetizers for the adults and food for the 3yr old. (PS don't keep a 3yr old hungry) Things seems to be getting better and we ordered our dinner.  The waitress came back about 5mins later and said they were out of ahi tuna. My husband ordered the ahi salad, which is what he was craving for dinner so we went to the Cheesecake Factory since it was one of the only ones he likes (except at BJ's).  So back to the menu but before he placed his order our waitress left to see what else off the ""healthy"" menu was also not available. When she came back, we played the are you out of this? game.  The evening continued to be ok but instead of a nice evening with friends, it was so late when we finally left the restaurant we were too tired and all went home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=780,3.64,3.3,3.204,2.6320000000000006,3.4360000000000004
971,Stephanie S.,"Brentwood, CA",457,251,279.0,3.0,2012-02-07,"As most of you know, the Cheesecake Factory is located in beautiful downtown Walnut Creek. Across the street from Century 14 Downtown Walnut Creek (one of my favorites). Less than 1 block down from the parking garage... which offers free parking (up to 4hrs, I believe).  When you walk up, you pass by the outdoor seating on either side of the walkway (one side for dining, the other for waiting). A fire pit in each seating area. I've asked to be seated outdoors on numerous occasions. I believe the wait time is less for the outdoors seating, but I could be wrong. Either way, I find it preferable to sitting inside where it can get extremely loud. Last night was my most recent Cheesecake Factory indulgence. My oldest and I stopped by while enroute to the Penninsula for a final fitting for her gymnastics competition.  Appetizers: - chicken pot stickers (highly recommend)  - fried mac and cheese (good, but nothing special) Salads:  - caesar salad (T)  - tossed green salad (mine). Really, really good.

We got there around 7pm. I'll admit my fault cause it was Valentines Day and people we being crazy. All the curb side parking spots were taken, so we had to park a little further down into the Valet parking area. We called in and told them we were outside.  We waited about five minutes before a car finally left and we got a parking spot. We waited another 10 minutes. Then some old guy in a Lexus pulls in behind us. This lady in a brown top and purple under shirt came over to him and asked him if he was picking up an order. She told him to go park in one of the handicap spots and she got his food! I was pissed. I was there for 15 minutes and nothing and he just pulls up and gets his food?  I called again to tell them I was out front. Again another 15 minutes go by. At this point I am SUPER pissed. My boyfriend convinces me to go inside and get it myself.  I go inside and go to the front counter. Of course no 'real' line just people standing around like zombies. I tell the guy, ""I have been out there for 25 minutes at curb side and waiting!"" He plainly goes, ""All curb side orders have to go to the bakery and they will help you."" Mind you it Valentines Day and the line is SUPER long. Three cash registers and only ONE open! What the hell. Took them 10 minutes for each person to get them a SLICE of cake. I waited in line for another 10 minutes. Line only moves up once!  My boyfriend calls me and tells me they are finally outside with my food. I don't think I have ever been this mad waiting to get a curb side pick up before. My boyfriend told me he almost went off on the lady cause of how long we waited and how others got served before us. I felt sorry for the server kid who had to deal with me. I know it wasn't his fault he was just a server. No tip, of course. We get home. The food was COLD and SOGGY. The slice of red velvet cake we had ordered, the cream had gotten so warm and soft that the cake started to sink into itself. I admit it was a busy day but still, you should have been much more prepared! I mean have a sign or a special register for curb side orders.

This was supposed to be just dinner not  a fu&%#ing  marathon of waiting.  Never do this to yourself, the food I had was orange chicken that tasted nothing like orange chicken it was more like orange chicken jerky it was soo dry. we got served water one time and we learned that if you don't ask for everything at the same time they can't produce.  This place F-ing sucks NEVER GO HERE, TELL YOUR FRIENDS.  i GUESS THEY THINK BECAUSE ITS WALNUT CREEK THEY CAN PULL THIS CRAP.  They didn't dare have a comment card on the table or at the door.  who is running the kitchen anyway. we didn't dare get coffee because they would have had to go to Columbia and get the f-ing beans.  I blame the orgainzation of the kitchen staff, they must have been keebler elves and couldn't reach the pots and pans.  because we ordered cheesecake and icecream and it took 45 more minutes.  realllllllly what is it to do cut the cheesecake put it on a plate and bring it out.

The restuarant is much more beautiful in comparison to the SF and Sacramento Cheesecake Factory locations. The decor is amazing and makes you appreciate lighting and mirrors. The food has been very good each time I've went. I have no complaints with their menu items. I really do try to order new things each time I go. The dessert is very good. You just have to be in the mood to eat sweet. The Red Velvet cheesecake is one of my classic favorites. The pecan pumpkin cheesecake is super good for those who enjoy pumpkin and/or sweet potato pies! The carrot cake cheesecake..well, after you eat this one, you'll end up in your dentist's chair not too soon after (it's way too sweet).  The Salmon dishes are always one of my faves. Their pizzas are OK. Their pasta is good and filling. Their crab wontons (appetizer) are very good. The crab/artichoke dip (appetizer) is the bomb! Their fruit smoothies taste fresh and refreshing.

You take their drink order. 30 minutes later you see they still don't have their drinks... mybe stop haning out over by the pos and grab the drinks sitting at the bar? 4. You take their food order and they request a couple appetizers... maybe bring out two small plates and a second set of silverware for the two people? 5. It's now 10:30 and you see that these are teh only two people left in the bar, their napkin (the one they were given) is covering their plate, their glasses are empty, and they are talking to another server... maybe ask them what they need instead of getting mad at the other server for paoching your table?

988,Heather D.,"San Jose, CA",122,48,1.0,4.0,2012-07-03,"The Cheesecake Factory is probably one of my go to spots in Walnut Creek. It's not nearly as expensive as most places that think a fancy name and a high price mean good food, which is a common occurrence in this area.  Starting with their cheesecake, I mean jeez. There are so many and they are a meal and a half by themselves, the half being all the whipped cream they slather on that bad boy. Anyway, I've tried many different types on any given Friday night with my friends and a cocktail. One slice easily feeds 2-3 people. So far the Red Velvet Cheesecake has stolen my heart.  Onto the food! The portions are monumental which I can appreciate given the slightly above average price tag. The menu is the size of a bible so choosing is never easy. One thing that bugs me is the Sunday Brunch menu, so many goodies and ONLY available on Sunday in a small time frame. That being said, I wasn't aware the first time I set my eyes on the Steak & Eggs. I ordered it with a grin and was met with an awkward...ummmm...it's Thursday sort of look. The waiter disappeared and back he came wearing the look a like, a smile. They made it for me anyway and it was orgasmic. Big props to that waiter and cook! Most of their food is pretty tasty and you'll always have Dinner 2 later with all the leftovers you bring home.  On to the service! You know, for as packed as this place gets, the service ain't so bad. Yes, it can be slow but the environment is so nice I tend not to care. Plus I haven't met a waiter yet that totally blew it on my order which tends to be picky. I guess in short, if you are in a rush, save it for a day with more time, otherwise get your hungry ass here already!  I give this 4 stars only because things can get slow and this place sort of wins by default when it comes to food choices given there aren't too many places that really knock it out of the park in good ole WC.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=760,3.24,3.2,3.164,3.12,3.2160000000000006

Sometimes, the bread is hard and crunchy, which is a little disappointing since I love the bread at the Cheesecake Factories. The service is always good and the waiters/waitresses are always very polite. I noticed that the food isn't very consistent. I used to order the pasta carbonara a lot, and sometimes the sauce would be watery, and other times extremely thick. The steaks are okay. I like the calamari and sweet corn tamales (so good!). The French fries are also yummy. Oh, and you can pass on the clam chowder - it's not the greatest. I love the Tuxedo and red velvet cheesecakes! The strawberry shortcake with vanilla ice cream is also really good.  Don't come here during peak hours if you want to talk peacefully with the people you are with. It gets really loud.

Typically the food is really good.  My fiance and I had an important meeting (6/6/12) with my boss the other night so we wanted to take him and his wife to dinner.  We all met at the restaurant and I ordered a grilled artichoke as an appetizer ($5 for Happy Hour) - my fiance ordered the spiniach artichoke dip $5 HH menu as well).  I have to say, 9 out of 10 times the food is excellent. The artichoke on this particular evening was awful. I am not sure they boiled it at all before grilling it: Tough, unflavorful, almost inedible  :(  The spinach dip was great - but we had a semi-smaller table in the bar area (though, it was regular seating - not bar service) and the spinach plate and chip plate were huge. It overwhelmed the small table and our limited space.   For dinner my fiance ordered sliders ($5 HH menu), as did my boss' wife. They both seemed pleased with the food and finished their smaller plates.  My boss ordered a huge sandwich & salad combo. I actually didn't pay attention to what the sandwich was but he said it was good - except that he ordered his plate with NO cheese, and it arrived with cheese. In the salad AND sandwich.  He's extremely lactose intolerant and had to be careful while eating.  I ordered the lettuce wraps - very good, except for the 3 sauces it came with.  P.F. Chang's serves this on their HH menu and they make a spicy, soy sauce type dip to go with it - I asked for hot sauce but received Tobasco. Can I call the weak sauce patrol? Not really thick enough for dipping... All four of us ordered (non-alcoholic) drinks. My boss and his wife had a sweetened tea, I had unsweetened tea, and my fiance had a Coke. Before the dinner was over, my fiance's half-full Coke was filled.... with tea.  Yes, tea - and he hates tea. My unsweetened tea was also filled at one point, with a sweetened tea. I drank it but I felt the server really messed up big time here. His lack of attention to detail was annoying and it makes you think twice the next time you're picking a place for dinner. AND we were never offered dessert or cheesecake at the end. I don't know that I would have accepted for sure, but my boss said something as we were walking out - and often if other people order dessert, I do too. The dinner was $59.27 before tip.

The ceiling reminds me of Las Vegas Caesar's Palace for those of you who've been there you might share the feeling. Great for groups as well and the wait staff is really patient.

It was the evening before my mother would return to Mexico, so naturally my brothers and I wanted to do something for her so we decided to take her to the cheesecake factory. I figured most of the bad reviews for San Francisco  CF are for the pricing too high and the cramped space, not many about the customer service. So we took her there,they don't take reservations even for big parties so we decided to wing it, now mind you, I was already on edge about my mother leaving so imagine my frustration when they said it'll be an hour wait and 4 of us would be at one table and 4 of us at another but they wouldn't be together!! The host said by the time we got a table large enough for us it would be closing time, it was 8:30!! Still fairly early but anyways thats a whole other review.. So we ended up at the CF in walnut creek (I wad extremely reluctant but again we winged it). I called ahead to see if they had enough room for 8 of us in about 30 minutes ( the drive from sf to wc) she said it would be a wait but yes  we got there and We waited about five minutes and were seated.  The waitress took our drink order but forgot my brothers wine, strike one.  One of the runners then brought out the food and brought out the wrong order again for my brother. He said that wasn't what he wanted so he took it back. Five minutes later, our waitress shows up with the same dish, sets it in front of him and says ""this is what you ordered"" and left.  He got up to get a manager, meanwhile I signaled our waitress over and say okay this isn't the pasta he ordered, the chicken is fine but not the pasta. She says ""okay do you want me to just leave the chicken here?"" WHERE WAS SHE GOING TO PUT IT?? there were no extra plates so I am curious as to what her thoughts where in that moment. I said ""um can you just take the whole thing back and maybe replate the chicken with the right pasta?"" so she took it back, by then the manager was at our table where my husband proceeded to describe what had just happened. My husband mentioned he worked at Ruths Chris for some time and he had never seen customer service like that. Now I've heard the manager is arrogant and will roll her eyes whenever approached by such issues, but she was very apologetic to my brother and my husband. But I didn't really appreciate the fact that after we got done explaining what happened she looks at my husband and says ""you worked at Ruths Chris? Cool, were you there when Vince was there?"" and tried to make conversation. TOTALLY UNPROFESSIONAL. We called you over to deal with an issue, not to strike up a little chit chat with my husband! Deal with the issue and that's it! We did end up getting another waiter but ny brother decided against any food or dessert for fear of bodily fluids ""accidentally"" ending up in it out of spite.  The next waiter but was okay but was kinda creepy walking up and down the aisle staring at us in case we wanted anything. When we got the check we gave him a pretty large tip considering he only took over our dessert, but this jackass had the shamelessness of COUNTING it right at the table! Who does that?!  We didn't even get any compensation for what the other waitress did. Not even one free slice of pie or a small discount as an apology. You figured we gave them 230 of our dollars they would at least compensate for something!

I feel like the Cheesecake Factory is put on a pedestal, since the environment inside the restaurant seems more upper class, and it is kind of pricier.. Anyway, I got a lemon chicken meal once, although it was huge as hell, it was the kind of chicken with a bone... like a fat ass chicken leg that you would buy from the carnival.. anyway, I don't really expect high class restaurants to use that kind of ugly chicken, i was hoping for a boneless breast or something.. The second time I got Salmon... how could you go wrong with salmon right? anyway they put some weird tasting sauce on it, that I wasn't expecting.. and also the salmon had a nasty texture, it wasn't really soft and also it just tasted gross. I love salmon, so this was definitely a heart break for me... They also don't have rice pilaf, so I just order normal white rice (i'm half filipino so I didn't mind as much..) but their rice... I could have made it better at home.  I tried to order Tiramisu but they were out. The waiter asked me more than 3 times if I was sure I didn't want anything else.. Are you kidding me? I was with a group of 15+ people so there's no need for him to try and suck up my money too, considering I didn't like the food so far and I only wanted Tiramisu! Jeeze I wanted him to stfu.. Today I actually went there at lunch with a friend, the lady asked inside or outside and we said inside.. we had to wait 5 minutes before being seated, although there was no wait!! unless you had a larger group but for only 2 people there shouldn't have been a wait.. also she seated us outside!! it was kind of hot so i just took off my jacket and dealt with it... then some guy approached us 5 mins after sitting down and said a waiter will be with us.. and then the same guy came back another 5 mins later and said he would be the waiter. throughout the meal he did not check up on us much and my water was empty for 3/4 of the lunch. He actually did come up and mention he would get me water, twice before he actually got the water.. I was not happy in the service, since he seemed too busy running around for other tables... and then also the service is bad, none of the people pay attention enough This restaurant doesn't seem to put enough effort towards their food. Once I went to TCF in SF and order a caesar salad but they gave me some weird ass salad with hella nuts in it.. gross.. so then got my caesar, which was also gross.. it's like they don't use traditional food or sauces/cooking methods that one would expect.. ugh.. the ONLY thing bringing me back here is the fried macaroni and cheese but once i find another place for that, I'll be gone!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=1060,3.2,3.27,3.184,2.8520000000000003,3.242

For many, those features are exactly the point, and the Big Bang Theory TV series references probably help (eh, Wil Wheaton?). There's also a movie theater across the street and all of Downtown Walnut Creek beyond, so a dinner and movie date night seems to be an excellent option (among others). Then there's the matter of my Teenage Son and how much he might enjoy the many choices of food and of course dessert. On that note alone, I'll probably be back.  I was here for Lunch today as part of a Service Celebration. A colleague had reached a significant milestone of working for our Company for 30 years, and this meal was on us as a small token of our appreciation. We had a great time and very full meals, so much so that my Cheesecake slice will be coming home tonight for Family consumption.  I even thought that I had ordered light, but even a half sandwich (turkey), soup (chicken tortilla), and Caesar salad (The Renee's Special, same as Toni) was two enough for me. The interior space is huge and custom built for groups of all sizes. There's also a full bar up front, but unfortunately there would be no alcohol today as this was a work-related function.

Soooo disappointed! That was my first below average meal from there and I was quite sad. Not at all what I expected.  It's ok though, I had room for cheesecake. I went out on a limb and trusted the waitresses suggestion to get the mango/key lime and it was wonderful!!  The Avocado egg rolls are always amazing!!

Cajun Chicken Jambalaya - the same delicious large portion of seasoned chicken and pasta, however it was SUPER salty compared to what i'm used.

My go to meal is the 3 cheese penne and a fresh strawberry shortcake. Also if their main menu seems to be a little outside you budget the have a great lunch menu for like half the price, and they serve til 5pm. So you can get great lunch or an early dinner.  Last but not least they recently added a new skinny menu, so they offer most of the same great foods, but they cut down the calories and carbs.

The food was okay, but definitely not worth the amount I paid.  That being said here comes the important information. First of all, our waiter was very demanding. He did not know the words please or thank you. He would say ""you better show me your I.D."" or ""give me your cup."" That's minus points for unprofessional and rude customer service. He also got some of our orders wrong. One person in our party didn't get her meal and had to reorder. My boyfriend didn't get his drinks that he ordered and also had to reorder. Secondly, we ordered mimosas and they brought us a bottle of champagne and two plastic cups of fresh squeezed orange juice (including all the pulp). They expected us to pour these big plastic cups of orange juice into slender champagne glasses. WTF? They said they didn't own any carafes or pitchers. The server tried to be considerate and pour the glasses for us, only to spill half of the orange juice in the plants near our seating area.  Lastly, we had a large group and were billed automatic gratuity which was understandable. So, we split the bill between our group. Some paid with cash and some paid with credit card. When the people who paid with credit card got their individual receipts to sign, the receipt had a tip amount already printed. BUT why would we pay tip if gratuity was already included in our bill?????? So we crossed out that extra tip that was printed on our receipts and wrote the amount we intended to pay. A few days later I check my credit card statement and they charged me that extra tip that I had crossed out!! (Extra tip that the server definitely did not deserve). Everyone in our group that used a credit card were charged extra tip as well. I disputed the charge and the credit card company resolved it.  But that was the last straw. You can screw up my food, spill my drinks, but you never mess with my money! haha SO BEWARE OF EXTRA CHARGES.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=700,3.2,3.25,3.172,2.724,3.23

The wait on weekends can be pretty bad, but normally 30 minutes or so.  It can get pretty cold inside, not sure why they crank up the air.

Last night I finally gave in and went... and found that it was too trendy and overpriced for me, with the addition of staff making everything totally awkward. There were four of us. We were starving. We ordered three appetizers. Waiter comes back about 15 minutes later to take our order (4 dinner salads, a burger, 2 filets, and a ""new chicken dish you'll love"").  He explains how he's new here and that the last table he had was AWFUL. ""They wanted everything SPECIAL, and ugh, they were GREEK, too."" Then he asked if we wanted refills on our drinks, and made us chug the remaining soda in our glasses. Really. Complete with the ""Chug! Chug! Chug!"" chanting, and ""Come on, you can do better than that!"" encouragement. I am totally serious. Server comes over 10 minutes later with our salads.  Wait... our salads? Shouldn't our apps come first? Hmmm. I guess the kitchen must be backed up. The salad was meh. Mixed greens (waiter said it would be baby lettuce) that were wilted, bitter, and contained one leaf that I am sure came from a philodendron. (But their ranch dressing is awesome. Enough of it made me forget about the icky greens.) So, 10 minutes after we finished our salads, our entrees came out. Wait... our entrees? Shouldn't our apps come first? We look at the waiter and ask where our apps are. Man... if I could bottle the look of horror on his face, I would make gazillions around Halloween. He says, ""Uh, your appet... oh God. Oh God! That is totally my fault. I am so sorry. I forgot them."" Forgot them at the counter? No... forgot to turn in the ticket. Dude. You have ONE job to do. And it isn't a hard job... you ask people what they want to eat, you tell the cooks what the people want to eat, and you bring the people what they want to eat after the cook has cooked it. And shit, at Cheesecake Factory the waiter doesn't even have to bring out the food! So, yeah. No apps for us. Our entrees? Overpriced and unspectacular. The burger was undercooked, the filets were overcooked, the chicken dish was missing ingredients. It would have been a fine meal if it was half the price. The manager came over when we were 2/3 through with our meals and asked if we'd like our appetizers. I really had to tell him that they were supposed to be APPETIZERS, not DESSERTS. To top it off, the manager offered us each free cheesecake to make up for his waiter's incompetence, so we each ordered a slice to go. Then the tab comes, and he had only comp'ed 2 slices. Great, add another $15 to the ridiculously overpriced meal. Awesome.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=700,3.44,3.23,3.192,2.8240000000000003,3.314

The architecture is astounding and it really is a beautiful restaurant. We had to wait a few minutes but that was no big deal. Very friendly hostess and staff overall.  Our waiter, Trevor, was also great.  We ordered the crab & spinach dip as an appetizer, I got the herb crusted salmon with mashed potatoes, and sauteed spinach instead of the asparagus. The boy got the jumbo shrimp/steak diane combo. Now here's the BAD PART....they forgot our appetizer! We waited at least 30 minutes (which is a long time, but considering it was my bday and I was with my love, I just enjoyed being able to spend some time with him) to get our entrees, and when Trevor brought us our dishes I asked about the crab & artichoke dip. He apologized and took it off of our bill, since we didn't want it anymore.  Another NOT SO GREAT thing is that before we ordered our food, we ordered piña coladas. They cost $10 each which is fine, but they had barely ANY alcohol in it! I drank my entire one on an empty stomach and didn't even catch the slightest buzz! Oh well. It still tasted great.  Our entrees were delicious. Very decadent and filling, even my bottomless pit boyfriend had to take some home for later. Even the next day the leftovers were great.  When we asked for our check, Trevor was nice enough to get us a slice of complementary cheesecake, since they forgot our appetizer. We got the dark chocolate/coconut cake and it was DELISH.

1099,Kristen S.,"Oakland, CA",292,158,123.0,3.0,2012-11-24,"For me, the Cheesecake Factory has a nostalgia factor to it that leads me to eat here  - it is the place that my family went to on special occasions or when we wanted massive amounts of food that would last us for multiple meals. In other words, Cheesecake Factory was a special treat. Unfortunately, Cheesecake Factory no longer has that appeal for me so the only thing that brings me back is to recreate some of that nostalgia. This Cheesecake Factory, as with most others, was super packed, although the wait time for 2 was less than 40min so that was pretty good. The food is usually always well-executed and tastes good, especially for the amount of people that come in. Unfortunately, my dining partner's pork chop was overcooked (this is the reason why I always hesitate to order pork chop at a restaurant like Cheesecake Factory in which they specialize more in foods that can be easily executed and sent out quickly) and the sauce was a bit too sweet. I ordered my go-to favorite  - the gumbo. While the taste was okay, it was a bit too oily and greasy after a while. When it arrived it looked like someone had thrown it all over the plate - presentation was super sloppy. I also found a stray ziti within the rice, which led me to speculate about what else could have accidentally fallen into my food...The appetizer was good though - the buffalo blasts are my absolute favorite! Biting into crunchy pieces of chicken with buffalo juice already mixed in with the meat - delicious! Unfortunately this wasn't the best Cheesecake Factory experience I've had, but for how many people it serves, the food is surprisingly consistent. We ended up opting out of the cheesecake, which for me is actually pretty common - I usually never get cheesecake because I fill up too much on the delicious wheat bread, appetizers even before I reach my entree. Overall, this was just an okay experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=900,3.4,3.27,3.22,2.7960000000000003,3.322
897,Brittany G.,"Elk Grove, CA",26,39,1.0,2.0,2012-11-24,"I've been here about 5 times over the last 3 years... only one time (the first time) did I ever have a truly great experience. The drinks were excellent, food was great, service great... but ever since it has just gone downhill. Granted the first time my best friend and I went it was relatively slow in comparison to its normal level, but we had a great time. I'm so sad to have to give this place 2 stars... but the last experiences have just pushed it over the edge... One thing you must know is that this place is busy... ALL.THE.TIME. I have gone at almost every hour of he day... and it has always been super busy (the exception being the first time). you ALWAYS have to wait. I really hate when places say 15-20 minutes... then you wait 45... and after the 45 minute wait they sit you outside at 9pm when its 55 degrees outside and put you no where near the fire pit... (like it would really help anyway since the wind was blowing the heat in the opposite direction) Brrrr! what good do heaters 10 feet over your head do when its your toesies that are freezing off!? This last time was just another reason not to go here again... no bread was given or even offered until i asked about it (if it had been my first time i wouldn't have even know to ask for it!!!!)... and that was only after we received our drinks and needed refills... there were four of us (we were starving) so the bread didn't last long... I asked for a bread refill along with our third drink refill... and then we ordered... granted the food came pretty quickly but the appetizer came with the entree's...  There was hardly any sauce on the pizza... so while we were eating we asked for extra marinara sauce... my boyfriends sister was waiting for the sauce to eat her pizza... and our server just kept walking by that table not even looking to see the status of our meal... his sister sat there and watched us all eat while munching on fries, helpless while she waited for her marinara... finally our server came back after everyone else had already finished to take our plates. seemed like she didn't even care or apologize that she forgot it... my boyfriends sister was just sitting there with an entire plate of food while ours was all gone....  I just ended up telling her to give us the sauce to go...and she gave us this teeny tiny cup with no more then a tablespoon of sauce what a joke!  so my boyfriends sister watched us all eat... to get this sad amount of sauce?! it was barley enough to pour over one slice!!! The server was super inattentive, she would walk all around avoiding eye contact so we couldn't get her attention. I guess I'm the picky one... my boyfriend and his family are just happy to get food... but for me? when we spend 97 dollars of our hard earned money on a LUNCH for 4 people... i expect a little better.  the food is usually tasty and the restaurant is absolutely beautiful but this is the 4th time i have been treated like crap here. The worst is how expensive it is, I don't mind paying for an expensive dinner/lunch if i get great service... but we work close to minimum wage while paying our way through college... $100 lunch is an entire 10 hour shift for us!!!!  totally unacceptable...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=680,3.32,3.28,3.212,2.7280000000000006,3.2960000000000003
882,JMark P.,"Napa, CA",3,53,,3.0,2012-11-27,"I own a business so I try to be fair.  To run a restaurant and then have lay people (especially teens and some 20 somethings who probably should not be reviewing a business) acting like they are Pulitzer prize winners all the while being ""food experts"" commenting on their restaurants must be hard to swallow.  Again, I try to be fair and I don't try to nitpick.  I've worked in fine dining as a waiter and went to chef school so I have a little knowledge.  That said: Remember that if a restaurant isn't busy, usually the food isn't good.  This place always seems busy. I've gone there several times.  The service is very friendly.  Twice I got the curbside to go order and it was fast and convenient.   The curbside take out is awesome.  You can call the bakery and order your meals and then park for free in the garage next to the restaurant and they will come out and bring your food to you.  They will take your money, get your change and you are on your way.  If you carry cash you can pay the bill immediately and I always add a couple of dollars as a tip.  I remember they were training someone and they were very sweet and informative.  I really appreciated their speed and great attitudes!   Sometimes when it gets real busy, service anywhere can be a little rough.  It's hard sometimes for staff to deal with the diva/high maintenance mentality of some people in today's world.   One time I was eating at the bar on a Friday after work, and man was it packed.  They also had someone out sick and they were training someone.  I read the room and told the waitress not to stress about me and just do her best.  I sat at the bar and got a couple of cold Guinness while she dealt with 2 tables of drunk crazy college aged people that were making her life hell.   The meal was late but I understood.  As I left the restaurant the manager stopped me and gave me a piece of cheesecake to go on the house.  The waitress was so appreciative and said I made her night.  Sometimes not being a hot head and showing patience does pay off.   The food is mostly solid.  To not have a regular bacon cheeseburger is kind of silly but for the most part the food is good.   People think a huge menu is a good thing but it's the exact opposite.  It shows a restaurant trying to be all things to all people and that usually spells disaster.  I've tasted the pasta dishes, pizzas and the asian wraps and they were bland and ordinary tasting.  No chef can cook a great meal every time with so many items on the menu.  I'm one of the few I think that doesn't like the desserts too much.  To me they are sickening sweet.  I make cheesecakes and I cant' imagine the amount of sugar that is in these recipes.  Many like them though so I'm a rare person.  Pros: Solid food nice staff love the cheeseburger and the appetizers are good too Curbside take out Cons: Very swamped on weekends so you will have to wait a long time Menu is too big; some items are hit and miss  Parking is a big pain at times.   For a chain restaurant it's not bad.  Out of all the ones I've been to, this one so far is the best Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=660,3.32,3.3,3.212,2.8920000000000003,3.3080000000000003

Waitress brought a glass of water to the table and the glass was dirty and the water had little bits of debris (maybe leftover food??) floating around in it.  I noticed it a few minutes later and grabbed a waiter and showed him the glass.  He apologized and brought us a fresh water, but that got me thinking about all the things that you don't catch when they serve you.

I also ordered some sweet potato fries, but with no Chipotle Mayo Dipping Sauce - a quick google search on my phone showed that it has gluten.  Overall, it was a solid 4-star meal that did the job. For other gluten-free peeps out there, please note that they don't have a gluten-free menu.  No allergen menu even.  So you are on your own.   The menu is about 14 pages long, so I see why - what a nightmare it would be to do a gluten-free version.

Well, it was worth it, especially when we took our friend for her first time, and also sneakily surprised/embarrassed her with a birthday cheesecake at the end of the meal! Wait Time: None. Excuse me?! Are we at the right place? Usually, we wait at least 45 minutes to get seated at our local Cheesecake factory in the City. Context, we did go on a Tuesday night around 7:30pm. You'd think more people would be going out during dinner time. Food: We split deep fried macaroni and cheese balls. YUM! Ever since my friend introduced me to them, we must always order that appetizer. I had the shrimp scampi pasta. It was definitely on the rich side, and very filling! Their brownie sundae was disappointing. I must have had high expectations; I was expecting something akin to Ghirardeli's sundaes, but nope, the brownie was not chewy, and the presentation was spread out on a plate rather than in a cup/bowl. Thus, ORDER THEIR CHEESECAKE for dessert; you won't be disappointed with that. Service:  Our waiter Billy was super helpful! Hah, he definitely understood my subtle hints on reminding him of our bday surprise! Validation: If you parked in the parking structure near SF Creamery, you are in no luck. They won't take your parking token. They even asked me what was I giving them/where I got the token -_-! For those that parked valet near Cheesecake Factory, they will validate your parking ticket! Price: It's cheesecake factory. On a budget? Split with a friend. Done deal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=520,3.08,3.19,3.236,3.504,3.146

We LOVED that we never had to leave our car, could just pull up and get the yummy dessert for Valentine's Day. I called, was immediately and politely assisted, transferred to the bakery and immediately taken care of post-transfer. The staff were very professional, friendly, courteous and quick to answer all of my questions. Since I couldn't pull up the full cheesecake menu on my phone, the guy taking my order was giving full descriptions of the cheesecakes I might be interested in. So many to choose from! I settled on the German Chocolate Cheesecake--SOLD! We ordered the half-size. The portions were huge--several thick, tall slices. $26. We shared one slice on the way home, and even with both of us hungry and eating it, we couldn't finish one slice--the portions were that big. The taste was Cheesecake Heaven!

Party of 4, first available table, in or out- 20 minute wait.  Nope, outdoor seating, we waited an hour, sat in an area where the heaters were not effective. Asked our waitress if the bar had single malt scotch.  What is single malt scotch? she asks.  Legitimate question and I briefly explain.  She returns with the answer - yes, we do have single malt scotch.  What do you have available?  Let me check - another trip.  Another waiter returns asking what I am asking for - a list of single malt scotches - okay, I'll get that for you.  The waitress returns with the list.  Oban 12 - great!  I'll take it. I ordered White Chicken Chili and a tossed green salad with honey mustard dressing on the side.  The chili was flavorless - really, I wish I could give a better description for you, but it was just flavorless, nothing distinctive, just no flavor.  The salad was delivered with oil and vinegar dressing on the salad.  I mentioned it was ordered with honey mustard on the side - I'll take care of that.  She did - she didn't remove the salad, she simply brought a vessel of the honey mustard dressing.  I guess I was to use it on top of the salad with the oil and vinegar dressing on it.  I didn't even bother to address this issue.  I just ate what she originally brought. Now, I know a restaurant that offers the selections The Cheesecake Factory has cannot be good at any of them.  But, I do expect acceptable food, but this was quite terrible. Too many better restaurants in WC to spend time and money here.  Beautiful and interesting interior architecture and an inviting outdoor patio are the pluses.

Sometimes they don't allow reservations, though. On a busy weekend night you will be waiting at least 30 minutes, unless you are fortunate and finds seating on the bar area, which I find the floors to be really really slippery, idk about you. It's fun to look at all the waiters/tress' white shoes. Some of their shoes are sooo filthy, I though they were donated or something. But they say that it just gets dirty in the kitchen. Really? Because it looks like you just climbed off Mount Diablo. Lol.  Anyway, for lunch my favorite is Kobe beef burger. For dinner, everything is good, and I usually stick with the pastas. I've been here with 2 people, and with 16 people. The service is always great, they are so friendly and funny here. They greet you, try to make small talks with you, nothing is awkward or pretentious here. I really really love the decor of this Cheesecake factory. The huge pillars, tall ceiling, intricate lighting. Very cute outside eating/hanging out area, large fire!! is so romantic.  The food always come in humongous portions, or maybe it's just the plates. Eitherway, free bread, of course, a little on the tough side for me. Pasta is always good here. Prices are expensive, though, but it never stops so many people of all ages from coming here. This place is always loud, and even with all this space, They could use more tables. One downside is the small bathrooms. But usually it's clean, so that's positive.

We started off with avocado egg rolls, which I have never had before, but am certainly a fan now. I want to personally thank who ever invented these. I ordered the Blue Cheese BLT burger. It was OK.

You take a sip from that oversized plastic tube-of-a-drink, with the words, ""Imperial Palace"" plastered on the side (you know, the drink that others doubt you can finish without getting alcohol poisoning. Yes, those). Well that's how you feel when you walk into Cheesecake. The decor truly makes you think you are in Vegas! And some even think they are (check out the scene on Friday nights) Glitzy and well-kept, this Cheesecake is by far the most visually impressive of them all.  Anyways, the food is delicious. The Louisiana style chicken pasta is to die for if you like a small kick to your otherwise decadent entree.  Skinnylishess Menu I have also had a lot of experience with the Skinnylishess menu (under 520 calories, right?) from the enchiladas to the turkey club. Overall, I have not been impressed with that menu, although I'm probably asking for too much. It's like ordering the vegetarian option a a steak house. Just done do it. They tried. So to be specific, I was not a fan of the enchiladas (it may be a matter of preference, mine being green sauce over red) but the vegetables on the side (zucchini, cauliflower and carrots) were not cooked and made to serve cold in vinegar. It was utterly inedible! It's not even bunny food worthy! Next time I will ask for streamed till soft vegetables. Problem solved!  I love this place for too many other reasons to give up on it! To stay on the safe side, I would just suggest ordering off the regular menu and taking the other half home! Noteworthy Plates Appetizers: Spinach Artichoke Dip with chips! Heavenly!

If artificial chic is your thing, you're going to be a happy camper.  The Cheesecake Factory is not exactly a vegan-friendly establishment. The name alone kind of sets the tone for the food you're going to be getting. My mother chose this place, and I reluctantly agreed.  First impression? The hostess was frowning and did not perk up as we walked in the door. Her sour expression made us feel really unwelcome. Strike one.  The place seemed to be full of snobby white folks and their out-of-control toddlers. If you're looking for a peaceful Sunday lunch, this is probably not the place for you. Screaming kids and uptight suburbanites aren't my favorite.  There was only one soup option (nothing vegan). It was a Loaded Baked Potato soup. My mom is on a diet and can't have potatoes. Basically, it was ""NO SOUP FOR YOU!"" Strike two. We took a second look at the gigantic menu. Mi madre opted for the Herb Crusted Salmon entree with asparagus and a salad instead of the mashed taters. She said it was excellent, although the filet was cold. Obviously the waitress had waited too long to deliver it to the table.  I selected the Veggie Burger. It sounded awesome: ""a delicious 'burger' made with brown rice, farro, black beans, fresh beets, and onion"". I ordered mine sans cheese or mayo, with sweet potato fries. The portion of fries was very small, but they were FANTASTIC.  The burger patty was a disappointment. I don't think they grilled it enough, or maybe it was sitting around at the expo counter. It was cold and falling apart. The taste was also bland and mushy. It reminded me of a  Plant Burger, but lacking all the flavor and texture. At least the veggies were fresh: pickles, lettuce, tomato, and red onions.  I should have ordered it off the ""SkinnyLicious menu"" (yes, that's what they call it). It comes with a side salad instead of fries, but it would have been 2 dollars cheaper. If I return, I'll probably go for the Kale Salad and a side of vegetables.

I came here for dinner with a couple of friends from out of town, hoping to enjoy a delightful birthday meal, and we got the exact opposite. After waiting forever for our entrees to arrive, I took bite out of my pasta and nearly had to spit it out because it was so salty! My entire table came to the same conclusion. Our server was nowhere to be found, our glasses were all empty, so we flagged down a different waiter who couldn't find our waitress either. Finally she comes around and I tell her about my food, at which point the manager comes to say that they added salt to the pasta water, so that's probably why. The rest of the table is nearly done eating by this point, so I don't want to order another dish. So we order cheesecake. The waitress tells us this round of dessert will be quick to arrive, apologies for the massive delay before, but again 30 minutes pass before we decide to ask where our dessert is. She checks and it eventually arrives. After we ask for the check, another 20 minutes pass before it arrives. At this point, the restaurant isn't even busy anymore - all the surrounding tables are empty. I just want to pay and leave, but we can't even do that. We can see our waitress standing about 15 feet away, entering tips into the computer and neglecting our empty water glasses and attempts to get her attention to just pay.

My all time favorite cheesecake is Chris's Outrageous cheesecake...this flavor is to die for. So sinfully delicious.  I usually go to the Cheesecake Factory in San Francisco in the Union Square area. I like it because its at the top of Macy's, which is my favorite department store. I have only been to the Walnut Creek location once and it is decorated the same inside as the one in SF.  For a chain restaurant, I have never been disappointed with The Cheesecake Factory. I never had a meal on their menu that I did not like. I try to order something different each time I go. The only downside is that their food is high in calories, carbs and fat. I think that is why they do not display how many calories are in each item on their menu. For this reason, I only occasionally eat at The Cheesecake Factory. An average of 3 times per year. Their prices are not cheap but not expensive either. Everything in my opinion is reasonable priced.

(Might be because I heard the owner lives nearby this one!) It can get busy at dinner hours when weather is nice out. Food is really prepared well. Its a bit loud and busy, but that makes it fun to be in that mix I think. It is not uncommon to hear Happy Birthday sung more than once, as it is a great place to treat someone to that. A bit expensive, but hey, you get that free warm bread brought to the table (ask for the dark bread, its better than the French) If you want to save on the cost, do as me and my wife do, split the Gumbo to two plates. Service is usually good but not perfect. For example last week we were seated after a short 8 minute wait. Place was not terribly busy, yet young lady who sat us down overlooked that the table had no silverware or napkins. Plus it was just wiped clean, yet it was my elbows that saw it was wet, not the hostess. Then the waitress also did not see that we had no silverware, even after food was brought to table, still nothing to eat with. We asked for both silverware and napkins. That might be why I kept a star back from 5! The employees could put that slight extra effort in, to make this place closer to perfect, but some don't. They are quite pleasant though. You can see that some hussle hard, then a couple others have one speed only. I still love this place and always look forward to eating here. Oh, wait, one last thing. The cheese cake is fantastic, but unfortunately it is very expensive! I buy a piece once a year maybe, and then split it to two people usually. Big fresh beautiful pieces of cheese cake, but what, $6.00 or $7.00 a slice? Wow... Great selection too. There is also a secret back left entrance from free garage too. Valet parking too back there.

978,Dangja M.,"Martinez, CA",291,78,67.0,3.0,2014-01-08,Been to this place many many times. I know you shouldn't come here Friday nights because the wait is super long and the rest of the days it's pretty quick. I like the bar area. It's first come first serve like any other. The drinks can be stronger and a bit less pricey.  Service is pretty good for the most part. I usually don't like restaurants that have a million different items because it's difficult to pick what I want. The food isn't really to die for. I rather eat Mc Donald's and pay a whole lot less and probably a lot less calories here. Keep in mind you get the hard nasty dry bread as an appetizer. If you looked at the calorie guide you'll die. Butttt the cheesecake here I love. My fave is the red velvet or the white chocolate raspberry. Parking can be a pain but they have a garage next door and valet parking. I'll be back here only for the cheesecake.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=760,3.44,3.5,3.356,3.34,3.4760000000000004

The 'background' music being piped to the patio was cranked up to such a high volume that it was quite the challenge to carry on a conversation. I know some people don't mind it, but I've never cared for shouting and straining to hear when I'm trying to have a relaxed visit. In the future, I still wouldn't be adverse to stopping by to take out some of their famous cheesecake, but it's unlikely I will be sitting down for a meal--even outside I now realize.

We orders three beers, coke and an appetizer first.  The appetizer got to the table and was half eaten before the drinks arrived.  Now appetizer is completely eaten and drink half gone before our waiter comes to get our order for our entrées.  Our entrees arrive in timely order carried by two ""food runners"" and auctioned off at the table.  you know how it goes "" who had the pasta who had the salad""  and of course the guys were served first.

1213,Rolo R.,"San Francisco, CA",32,39,,1.0,2014-04-20,"This review is base on their management. A friend of mine applied for a position for this particular Cheesecake Factory. He went there in the afternoon, and spoke to the manager at the time, after the interview was done he was told that he will get a call back after they do a reference check on him. 2 days later finally they're done with the checking of his references. He was told to come in at a certain time one day the week after. He went in the day he was told to comeback. So when he got there he was told that the manager that told him to comeback that day is off, and no other manager has any notes or some type of recollection of the 2nd interview for that day. So he wasted his time coming there for no reason because since nobody can interview him for the 2nd time that day he was told to comeback again a few days later. This is without an apology from any of the management members and it seems like there's a lot of them there. You would think they are communicating with one another but apparently not. It shocking that this establishment is successful if the management member is not talking to each other. The only excuse given to my friend is that they are on a transition of getting new managers. For me that is not a legitimate excuse, if a company is going through changes it's the companies job to communicate with one another on what's going on with the restaurant. So my friend that was not interviewed the 2nd time was ask to comeback again. So he came back again to meet with another manager that he was told he was suppose to meet with, but guess what? That manager is off for the day already when he was asked to comeback that certain time. This is unbelievable! You can understand the frustration of my unemployed friend who's been told over and over again to comeback so that someone can interview him. He waited about 30 minutes for a new manager there to interview him where she only asked 3 questions. After that 3 questions, the manager that was interviewing him told him that if he doesn't hear from them within 24 hours they moved on to another applicant. Without any type of apologies all he was told was to move on if he doesn't hear from them. My friend is planning on calling the department of labor because he felt like he was discriminated by this company, and he is also going to call Cheesecake and ask for their Regional manager and corporate office because of this whole situation that occurs. He know this review may not matter since this is a huge establishment and it doesn't matter how many bad reviews is written about this place they will still be successful, but he just wants his voice to be heard, and sends out this warning for whoever want to work there. Because of how he felt he was treated he will never be coming back to this place to eat, and his friends and family will sure hear about this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=980,3.68,3.47,3.368,2.8200000000000003,3.5540000000000003

Wether it's slow or rush hour, the waiters; waitresses; and hostesses have always been top notch. My girlfriend and I always get the chicken fettuccini with sun dried tomatoes. It's definitely a safe bet. Today, I got the shepard's pie. It was great. Definitely going on my go to list. On top of the food, we got two piña coladas. They were perfectly made, not too much alcohol or smoothie. Overall: you won't be disappointed when you come to this Cheesecake Factory location.

I wanted some dessert, she wanted a salad, we both wanted a nice romantic place - so we've decided to try this one. Location is nice, we've found a parking space without any problems, although there was not many of them. Probably we just got lucky. Area with outdoors table is looking cool, like some resort-area restaurant somewhere in Southern Europe, like Turkey (it's Asia actually but who cares) or Bulgaria. These fountains with fire are really exciting. Inside... Well it's not so romantic. Interior is not bad, every table with seats are looking pretty good but not extraordinary. It's pretty loud there and organization of tables in this area isn't really intimate. So the place and feeling was good in general but not excellent. Main disadvantage - it's really loud there. If you want intimate date, either sit outside or go to other place. We expected European-sized food so we were thinking about ordering 2 salads and 2 desserts. Luckily we've decided to give it a try at first. My wife ordered traditional Ceasar + cappuccino, and I've order 30-years anniversary cheese cake with some caramel moccaccino. Well... The portions were huge! We've been eating ceasar together and still weren't possible to finish it. Salad was good, chicken and croutons also were good (but we'd expect a bit more of them), cheese was.. Hardly noticable - there was really small amount of cheese. I had a feeling that smth is missing - either cherry tomatoes or eggs. Beverages were just not bad, but not awesome. They didn't cause any negative reaction but we weren't excited. The cheesecake - well thi is smth that was really good. It was so big that we couldn't eat even a half of it. And really tasty.

We had a small party of 3.  It's Friday night so very busy, and we were fine with the 40 minute wait. We put our name in, got a buzzer and some drinks and sat outside to wait. Very nice ambience outside so we enjoyed ourselves until we noticed the waiting area clearing out and our buzzer never going off. After an hour we asked about the status of our table. The girl had to ask someone else and then took the buzzer back and said we would be seated shortly. After 10 minutes more we were finally seated. Nearly double the time we were initially told. No apologies for the wait.  As we were being walked back to our table, the hostess asked if we were celebrating anything. I mentioned it was my mom's bday and she asked her name so they could come sing. That never happened.  We got our menus and our server took our order. Our food came fairly quickly and we ate. My mom loved her food (miso salmon, although she said it tasted more like teriyaki), but my sister and I were not crazy about ours which were absolutely drenched in sauces that weren't very good (lemon herb chicken and shrimp scampi/steak Diane combo).  Then we sat and waited for our server to come back and check in so we could ask for boxes and possibly order some cheesecake. And we waited. And waited. For over 30 minutes where he was nowhere in sight (and he'd already been on break and back because another girl was introduced to us and helping during his break). Finally he came back to box our food and we asked for a dessert menu. He disappeared again so we decided to have my sister get the cheesecake to go from the front while I tried to get the check. That took another 20 minutes or so. We got there around 7 and didn't leave until after 10. Never once did anyone apologize for the long waits. I work in customer service and little things like that go a long way.  All in all I was displeased with the LONG waits and the service. Food really wasn't great either, especially for the price.

Went to the Cheese Cake Factory to celebrate my girlfriends birthday (party of 5) on a Thursday. The actual service was very good and the food was good, no complaints. My problem came about after the my visit to the restaurant. I was checking my bank acct. the following day Friday and found that I was charged twice for the same amount (the amount was over a $100). I called my bank and they stated it was most likely a mistake and probably would be corrected by the restaurant the next day. The next day was a Saturday, I checked again on Monday and still had the same 2 charges pending on my acct. I gave it one more day to see if it would clear. Checked again on Tuesday and still both same charges pending on my acct. I called the restaurant and spoke with a Mgr who assured me they only processed 1 charge and tried to explain how it could have happened. Basically, what it boiled down too was employees not following procedures with payment processing. My acct was finally corrected but after tying up my money for both charges for 7days total, 5 working days.

474,Iona C.,"Orinda, CA",491,374,1909.0,3.0,2014-06-16,"One of my two younger brothers just LOVES The Cheesecake Factory (TCF).  Yes, I know, his taste is absolutely questionable. Just kidding.   I think I can KINDA get why he likes it so much.  We came here yesterday afternoon to celebrate his birthday.  There were a lot of people waiting outside (apparently a lot of fathers love this place, too - belated Happy Father's Day to all you fathers and father-figures), and we were quoted a 40 minute wait time.  They give you the option of choosing between indoor seating, outdoor seating or first available.  I didn't eat breakfast that morning so I went with option numero tres.  Instead of giving me one of the usual restaurant pagers that lights up and vibrates, the host asked for my name and cell phone number.  Afterward, he printed out a small slip of paper that had my aunt's name (misspelled - 'C' not 'S,' dear), the time we put our name on the waiting list, our estimated wait time, and a time that we should be nearby. I personally love this system.  When we went here last September they didn't have this, but I think it now makes it easier to wander off to a local shop instead of just milling right outside the restaurant because you're afraid to step outside the radius in which your pager can still function. We ended up receiving a text telling us that our table was ready at 2:16, 13 minutes before the suggested time for us to be nearby, and only 22 minutes of waiting.  Awesome! We ended up getting a table outside which was perfectly fine since it was nice and warm.  Our waiter, Jose, got us our drinks, took our orders, and got us bread and butter in no time at all.  Here's what we got (and some notes): Birthday Brother -  *Coke - 2.95 ^ BBro said it tasted like the diet version so we asked a passing waitress for a new one.   Still tasted like diet, so we had our original waiter bring out Root Beer instead.  Don't quite know what's up with that. *Fried Mac & Cheese appetizer - 9.95 ^ I thought this sounded gross, but it was actually pretty good.  When will I learn that fried makes everything better? *Grilled Fresh Salmon - 19.50 ^ Served w/ broccoli garnish and mashed potatoes.  Sizeable portions. * Red Velvet Cheesecake - 7.95 ^ BBro only ate half, but said it was good. Other Brother (lol, sorry) -  *Buffalo Burger w/ Fries - 11.95 ^ They made a mistake since he actually asked for a salad.  Oh well.  Older sibs love fries so it's ultimately a lose (for him), but win for me and the other bro. *Reese's PB Chocolate Cake Cheesecake - 7.95 ^ Littlest bro is a pretty healthy eater and took two bites of this.  Methinks the older bro advised him to order it for himself... Aunt C. -  *Mojito - 11 ^ Not overwhelmingly minty.  Decent. *Skinny Hamburger - 9.95 ^ Comes with a salad in a vinaigrette + thinner buns and no butter.  I think they should just call it a ""Sad"" Hamburger at this point. *Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake - 7.50 ^ Auntie loved it and finished it in one go! Mom (To Go) -  *Mango Keylime Cheesecake - 7.50 ^ Mom loved it! Me -  *Kobe Burger w/ Fries - 13.95 ^ Didn't really taste a big difference in the meat... I guess I'm not classy enough to appreciate it.  Whatevs. *Godiva Cheesecake - 7.95 ^ I'm a total chocoholic, but even I have to eat this in stages.  So rich!

But when you have a party of ten you have to wait for the manager to approve you or okay the fact that you are being added to the list... This took twenty minutes to get the manager to talk to you. So once we finally got our name on the list we then had to wait an additional hour and a half. So over all just ten minutes shy of two hours. So our buzzer goes off, and so we go in to check and the host is beyond rude. She looks at us and says oops not you guys. So we ask how much longer, and without even lifting her nose up from the computer she starts to stare at us and rolls her eyes. Seriously?  Then we continue to wait for 30 more minutes and are sat close to closing. The server started out really great, but towards the end you could tell we were an inconvenience to her and her wanting to go home. We ordered drinks, appetizers, and entrees. With the intentions of ordering dessert. It just kept getting worse, food was cold, cooked wrong, server started to get rude with us. So we asked to talk to a manager. And he simply was just a waste of breath and time to talk to. He thought by ""buying"" desserts for us that it rectified the situation.

I was tempted, but forwent the Parmesan for a ""tad bit"" healthier pasta dish ;) The Steak Diane was okay in my opinion. I've had better before but come on, it's Cheesecake Factory so what more do you want? The $19.95(!)dinner combo w the Steak Diane and herb crusted salmon is a really good deal!

The Cheesecake Factory is best for comfort food. Though they do have a diet menu, something I cannot say of other chain restaurants, nothing on it really appealed to me. The burger I had was delicious and the Oreo shake I had was okay, but not as thick as I would have hoped for. They are also one of those restaurants that serves HUGE portions and then asks you if you want dessert afterward (um, no thanks. I'm stuffed after those HUGE portions of food).  The service was decent up until we got our food, then it got sort of strange. The servers we had were friendly, but at times a bit too friendly. I declined on a slice of tasty sounding, but caloric and fattening, piece of cheesecake and got a ""but it's the Cheesecake Factory!"" from our server, which I felt was a teeny bit rude. Before that, a server made a comment on my food (""a cheeseburger and a milkshake. That's a lot of food!""), which I felt was also a bit rude. I understand that they were trying to be friendly, but they were trying too hard in my book and it made me feel self-conscious about what I had ordered.

Before that though, we had to indulge in drinks, apps, and dinner. We started with the crab bites and the mac and cheese marinara appetizers. They were great comfort foods and appealed to me and my husband! The drinks were okay, we didn't order anything too substantial. Then, onto dinner. I, being Irish, was looking forward to the Shepherds pie- *let me stop you here, if you have the same plan*. I was so disappointed. It tasted like a 1.99 frozen dinner salisbury steak- reconstituted with pasty mashed potatoes. I have had better and wished I had ordered something else. Now, onto desert!

Fire fountain in middle of the outside waiting area (which was filled) and then all the beautiful lights and structural masterpieces within the building.  We arrived at 6:42pm on A Sunday. We put our names in, only 20 min wait for two, no problem! We went outside enjoy the beautiful view of the fire fountain and street. Now, in Cheesecake Factory when your table is ready they text you! Wow, way to blow our minds.. I mean in a world no one really talks on the phone, pretty amazing. We got our text at 7:05, we went to the front & was told ""Great! Step to the side & your waiter will be back to walk to your table!"" Well, SIX other families also got that same text AFTER us and went to their tables before us. FOUR other couples stepped to the side AFTER us and when to their tables. All along after, another 20 min wait, we received a table. (Almost an hour now)  We got a small booth in the back, which was overlooked by another booth. Awkward..  It was NOISY! Kids screaming, people chattering, silver wear clanking... Not as intimate as we were expecting!  We ordered Orange chicken & Angel Hair Pasta with Shrimp. My fiancé loved his chicken. My shrimp was OVERcooked to the point it was chewy. Gross. I didn't even eat the angel hair pasta because the ""touch"" of marinara was covering the plate.

419,Carol C.,"Alameda, CA",198,884,6324.0,4.0,2014-11-25,"My girlfriend picked me from the Walnut Creek BART Station to dine on late lunch at this Cheesecake Factory. We were both celebrating our birthdays - mine is tomorrow (November 26) and her birthday is on November 28. My friend and I don't often get together for birthday lunches, so we decided to make it a tradition to dine at different restaurants in the future. As usual, we were somewhat undecided as to what we wanted for late lunch. The menu is extensive, making it a difficult decision to hone in on what we felt like eating. The waitress, Jenna, gave us ample time to decide. She was attentive in filling our water glasses, and occasionally checked to see if we enjoying our meals. We started with appetizers - mini crab cake bites and sweet tamale corn cakes. Both apps were delish, but I wished they serve more than 1/2 dozen of those crunchy seafood delight. I probably could have eaten a dozen of them. My girlfriend never had the sweet tamale corn cakes, which is one of my favorite apps. We agreed not to have any pasta dishes as entrees - more carbs - even though chicken fettuccini is a tempting dish. I should have went with the salmon Genovese, which my girlfriend had. She enjoyed it very much. I decided on the shepherd's pie. The dish was a tad too salty for me, so I only ate about half of it (3 stars). The waitstaff came with our ""birthday"" cheesecakes - slice of pumpkin for my friend and a slice of mango key lime for me...oh yum (4 stars).  Service was a little slow, but that's okay. It gave us time to digest the food and relax for a few hours. The drawback: street parking can be difficult. There is a public garage about two blocks away.  I like this Cheesecake Factory better than the one in Macy's Union Square (SF) because it is less crowded during the weekdays, less tourists and more spacious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=220,3.12,3.33,3.436,2.8000000000000003,3.246

We happened to be in walnut creek today and thought this would be a good place to end the day with.  So I ordered the grilled salmon and he ordered angel hair. The salmon turned out to be super dry, like those overcooked chicken breast that i had to chew quite hard in order to swallow. His shrimps were fewer than usual and overcooked super dry as well.  I finally decided to talk to the waiter after finishing the second bite. The waiter was nice enough to redo the order for me. Their manager also came out to do a simple apology. i thought that was a nice gesture. we waited a long time for the second one.. in fact i finished the rest of the food and decided to pack up the new salmon piece when it arrives. When it arrived. it was super small.. about half of the original order. compared with this picture, the previous apology did not seem genuiun at all.  By then, I did not think it was fair for me to discuss this matter further and wasted more time over a properly cooked, fair portion of salmon.. this incident was very disappointing that we even decided to skip our dessert and just went home.  The reason that I wrote up this review serves as a reminder to the restaurant not to compromise their quality standard even though it is a busy holiday season. if you are understaffed, hire some seasonal help! you can't let customer bear the cost like this.. not sure if  this is a cheesecake factory problem or just this location...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=460,3.12,3.34,3.44,2.308,3.2520000000000007

We arrived there around 7:20 and told the guy at the front desk that we would sit either inside or the patio. A few minutes later we noticed a table open in the patio area and mentioned to the same guy at the front that we would rather sit outside. He explained that we were next in line and that we would be called shortly. About 15-20 minutes later we received the text that a table was ready. We waited for about 5-7 minutes for the three-four young people at the front to stop chatting with each other and seat us. We were in the process of being led to our seats inside when I mentioned that we were waiting for seating outside. The girl said the wait would be another 5-20 minutes. At this point all three of us felt that we had waited enough. The manager (Mike) overheard us complaining and came over. He said that there had been a mis-communication as the guy upfront thought that we had asked for seating inside. I explained I had informed the person upfront that we wanted patio seating and that he was aware of this. The manager walked away and apparently rolled his eyes. We took the inside seating after a 40 min wait.  I was upset at that point because the manager did not apologize or offer us a free drink or dessert. The customer service from the server was excellent; the manager definitely needs some training. After telling our server that we expected a free dessert at least for the birthday girl, she received an extremely small slice of cake. We asked if this was the regular size and the server looked really uncomfortable and didn't reply. Altogether the experience was great because I was in good company. The food and drinks were great.

I went on Saturday night between 7pm-9pm. SERVICE was really SLOWWW!!!It was terrible and I really want to attribute it to the fact that this was a high volume night but on reading other reviews this seems to be a running theme. First it took about a 1/2 hour to get a seat on the patio...that's OK there were packed so that was reasonable. Second I did not love the fact that the only section that has access to any kind of heat is close to the fire pit...everyone else is left to fend for themselves in the cold. Granted nights aren't frigid but it would be nice to have heat lamps throughout the patio to ensure that all your patrons are comfortable when seated outside. It can get breezy and chilly. third it took more that 45 min to get our food and that was after I had to talk to the manager.

The wait time was a lot shorter today (which is very odd because it's the weekend), but the service is so friendly! The unlimited, complimentary bread and butter is also a bonus. I got the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta and the Lunch Special Herb Crusted Fillet Salmon. It was delicious; by far my wisest combination.  - The salmon alone is cooked well, topped with plenty of herbs. It also comes with a special sour sauce, mashed potatoes, and 4 asparaguses. - I personally think the pasta I've gotten today is their best. I've tried others before and they definitely don't taste like ""4 stars"". But this specific one has certainly outdone itself. It has the perfect combination of sautéed shrimp and chicken with different peppers. Their Cajun Sauce is so rich, that it perfectly brings the whole dish together. It says ""Very Spicy"" but I think it has more of a small spicy after-taste (which I loved, but spices depend on different people).  Overall, it was one of the best experiences I've had. The prices weren't bad, based on the portions they come in.

I have Celiac and HAVE to avoid all sources of gluten or I become ill.  Half way through my ""Angel Hair Shrimp"" pasta entree, which arrived with spiral noodles, I found spaghetti noodles in the mix.  Rather than make a scene and send it back (I had already waited 10 minutes longer than anyone else at the table of 7) I just stopped eating.  We also had to leave for our awards event. There was no time to wait 1/2 hour for another entree. At checkout, I asked the waitress to please alert the cook to this problem.  She said she would, was sorry, and offered to bring me another meal.  That was that!  No contact by a manager or supervisor.  $17.95 for 6 shrimp was a price meal. I have been to other restaurants and had real concern and understanding of the issue with Celiac form the servers and cooks.  Either Cheesecake Factory management doesn't understand the really health concerns and consequences of those who truly can't consume gluten, thinking it is a personal choice and not a medical issue, or they really don't care!  I won't be eating at any Cheesecake Factory again.  My physical pain this am, confirms that I had gluten last night! I think the Cheesecake Factory needs to seriously step up their game with regards to cross contamination. Either that, or take the Gluten Free symbols off their menus and be honest about their food prep practices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=920,3.0,3.28,3.408,2.472,3.1680000000000006

It is so crowded, the menu is overwhelming, and the food is not that good. During our wait we went to the bar and ordered drinks. On the menu, under the heading ""On The Rocks"" was a Ruby Red Sunrise drink, which we ordered since we like our drinks on the rocks. I noticed the female bartender (light hair, pony-tail, large frame) starting to blend some drinks and I said to my husband, she's blending our drinks. When she served us the drinks, I said, we ordered our drinks over the rocks. She gave us a very rude glare and grabbed the drinks and said, they are flash blended. I said, but they are supposed to be on the rocks, that's what the menu says, correct? She rudely started to make new drinks, when I said, don't worry about it, we'll take the drinks, she rudely said, I already started making you new drinks. I insisted it was okay, because I felt so bad that she was so visually bothered by this. She gave us the original drinks back.  The drink was really good, but, be sure to tell them you want it on the rocks, because the menu does not say flash blended.

We were told 2 to 2.5 hours when we got here and we were ok with it, due to how busy it was. the food is normally good, but without some type of reservation system, to realistically estimate wait times is both unprofessional and dumb. Seems like customer service and efficiency isnt a top priority here. After 3.5 hours, we find out after their ""system"" of texting or calling your cell, the host didn't communicate to his replacement, we were still waiting and when she verbally called the name for our group, she couldn't find us because it was loud and crowded. So this lady gave our table to another large group. So we had to wait another 15 minutes for the hosts to get another table ready.

Though I have nothing that has come close to the Farmhouse burger they used to have, everything I've had since then has been pretty solid. Just not quite a home run with me.  Though their Sunday brunch items are all very good.   Service has been much better since my first experience though the wait times always seem to be in consistent.  It would be nice to be offered bar space if available right out  the gate. We always seem to have to ask.  I know it's nit picky but to me that's a sign of a host/hostess making the extra effort.  In the end it's hard to go wrong here when you're with folks who can appreciate Cheesecake for what it is and not try and compare it to anything else but other chains around.  For my money Benihana, Cheesecake, and Chili's are the best in the business and it shows in their staff and their food.

I'm always disappointed by their cheesecakes.) I ate here the other day. My husband and I split the crab and artichoke dip, which was very good except for the hair in it. And it wasn't a hair that floated out of the ether and landed on top, but a tight black curly hair buried close to the bottom... I'm telling myself it's an arm or chest hair. At first I thought an eyelash had fallen into the dip (maybe, hopefully mine) but when I plucked it out, that little sucker came twisting from the dip, obviously very mixed in. Eeeeeew. We let the waitress know nicely...it wasn't her fault and hair is that evil beast in the kitchen that's hard to keep completely out. It happens. Just wanted to let them know so they could check their dip for possibly more rogue fuzzies. (Why do I always feel guilty for letting a restaurant know about an issue?!) The rest of our meal arrived. I ordered the lunch portion of the salmon genovese and my husband got the chicken sandwich, salad and soup special. Both were very very good. We went home with plenty of leftovers. The portions are out of control huge here which is tough for me because I like trying a little bit of everything rather than eating a mountain of the same thing. The bites menu somewhat satisfies that desire, but I honestly don't come here that often because of the portions.  The two things I don't like about this place would be the indoor dining area and the cheesecakes. I only like eating outside, the interior is boring and makes me feel uncomfortable. Most importantly, somehow, they manage to screw up all of their cheesecakes. The last one I tried was the white chocolate, caramel and macadamia nut cheesecake. It would have been delicious if it weren't for the crust. Imagine a bite of incredible perfection only to get to the bottom where your taste buds are assaulted by a very burnt caramel flavor. Stomach churning. I ate around the rest of the crust but couldn't shake that burnt flavor. Yuck. Yuck. Yuck. I would hope the quality control on cheesecakes would be better since that's the name of the chain.

Don't worry, I wasn't the only dude there.  We celebrated early Valentine's Day here, and it looked like others did too.  The wait wasn't that bad, we were told 15 minutes and we got our table in only 8 minutes.  They really did up the building inside & out with high ceilings, weird lights, and fake plants.  The menu was several pages long, a third of that was appetizers.  The lighting was pretty low both inside and out, made it hard to read the long menu.  We were outside near a, um, ""fire island"".  Prices were typical of a place like this. Me = Cajun chicken nibblers, Hunny = smokehouse burger, girl = cheese pizza, hit to wallet = under $50.  We did NOT have dessert;  hunny's not having it right now, girl doesn't like cheesecake, and I'm not a dessert kinda guy (I know, we're missing the best part).  Response to food:  Girl = ""It makes my mouth water.""  Hunny = ""Juicy, I have to keep wiping my hands off.""  Me = chicken was pretty dry, succotash was tasty. Service was tremendous!  We got Brittany, she was attentive without being overbearing, always smiling and helpful.  I noticed that the other wait staff was just like her.  She earned her tip, and I made sure she got a big one. So who else was on the patio outside?  Couples celebrating early V-Day.  A few families.  Seven girlfriends having a Friday night on the town.  Yeah, the kind of people who would come to this place.

I've noticed the last couple times I've been here, the service has tremendously gone down hill. Honestly I don't even know why I go back.  First, we were being seated to our table and the hostess realized that our table had been given to someone else so we had to wait another 10 min for the first available table. Next, we were seated and our table for 4 was missing a chair and had no place settings in which we had to ask for. Our sever came over and took our drink order and at that time we were figuring out what appetizers we wanted to get and because we were taking too long to decide he decided to leave us to let us further decide and get our drink orders. (20 min later)  So he comes back with our drinks and we decide to put in our dinner order with the appetizer because we didn't want to wait any longer to eat. So one of our appetizers comes out. My mom specifically ordered salmon rolls and they brought out shrimp rolls. She is allergic to shellfish. Thank god she didn't bite into it. Our entree maybe came out in  another 20-25 after that. Our server never came to check on us to see how our food was. He was practically non existent all night. Two couples had ate and gone next to us before we were even presented with our meal. I can go on and on. I was so livid I went to talk to the manager and was offered free cheesecake or an entree taken off my bill. The manager and waiter argued their points instead of just apologizing and consoling us. When they came out to sing happy birthday to my cousin they didn't even bring her a spoon for her sundae. Until the very end the waiter kept bringing back the check without running my step dad's card so we had to send the check back 3 times to settle the bill. We spent 2 hours in a restaurant mostly sitting and waiting. This was beyond ridiculous! At least the food was good.

First issue was us having to ask for our bread when they are supposed to just bring it.  In my waitresses defense she gave us the rundown how tired she was though because she had been there since 7 am going over the new menu. This was around 4pm so I sort of understand her exhaustion.  Second issue I ordered my turkey burger without mushrooms and about 20 minutes after I ordered my waitress very politely told me the mushrooms are cooked into it and they can't leave it out so I need to change my order. I wasn't offered a menu to make a new selection so I had to quickly try to remember something else. Which was the grilled chicken with avacado club.  Third issue my son got his food and realized he ordered fruit not fries and she very kindly brought him his fruit.  Fourth issue my son started to eat and realized that the chicken sliders he had ordered were not what he was eating. Instead he got burgers.  Which he wasn't a big fan of. We were pretty annoyed at that point so decided not to send it back and my son just ate a little bit and left not full.   Fifth issue was when I finally got my plate, after the rest of my family had already been eating for a bit, it was extremely greasy. The bread was soaking wet in grease. The chicken was super chewy and I couldn't even eat it. I did not let me waitress know that I was displeased with the food but was a bit surprised she didn't ask when my whole sandwich sat there as we paid our super overpriced bill. If the food was good than it wouldn't be too overpriced but it wasn't.

We were seated by a very nice booth big enough for 4 people by a large window. The complimentary bread and butter were nice. Had to ask for small plates for the bread because our server forgot, but no big deal. Back to the bread, the sourdough bread didn't have much flavor, even with the butter. The darker brown bread on the other hand, was delectable! It was very soft and had great flavor, and the butter added to the flavor.  After we ordered, we waited quite a while - about 20 minutes. Our server, Cesar, was nice and addressed us as ""my ladies"" which was so nice.  We ordered the lunch specials: Pasta Carbonara: spaghetti with smoked bacon, green peas, and a Garlic-Parmesan Cream Sauce ($12.95) and the Skinnylicious Chicken Enchiladas: didn't get a description ($13.50).  The enchilada were on the spicy side for me, but it was nice for my mom. She had some pickled vegetables on the side which she said was refreshing. Good sized salad. My mom said that the enchilada is just a tad salty though.  I enjoyed my Carbonara. It was very creamy. Not a lot of bacon, but I also asked if Caesar could grate a lot of cheese. It was good overall!  Total: $28.70",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=300,2.92,3.12,3.316,2.8960000000000004,3.0400000000000005

We gave it back to the hostess but then we didn't get seated for another ten minutes??? Why would you buzz us if you're not even ready yet? Our server, friendly enough, seemed really busy&had his hands full. We had to ask two different servers for bread&it took a while to even get us our drinks. I ordered the spaghetti&meatballs but they ran out of spaghetti?? It was kind of better with rigatoni pasta instead but still bland. They meatballs were just average too.

The food was amazing as always, but the service just ruined my mood. When I got into the restaurant, the hostess didn't even have a happy look. She seemed so angry at the world and didn't want to be there. After a 30 minute wait for a table we were finally seated. I was hoping to get a nice friendly waitress or waiter, but no I didn't. My waiter didn't come to my table for a good 15 minutes. When he finally came he asked what my sister and I wanted to drink and left. I wanted to tell him we can order since he already gave us 15 minutes to but he ran away. Right there, I knew this is going to end bad. He finally came to our table with drinks and was about to leave! Thinking that we needed more time to think what we wanted to eat! So I told him we wanted to order, there was no ""what can I get you"" like a real server would say. He said "" okay give it to me"" with attitude. I ordered a cup of soup and pasta. I was thinking that my soup would come out first, but no!!!! It came out at the same time!! So by the time I was finished with my soup I didn't want to touch my pasta! After eating my sister and I decided to eat a cheese cake. We asked for a menu and knew which one we wanted. Looking for our waiter so we can order again, I found him sitting with customers for a good 10 minutes! Does he not know he has other tables?? It seemed like they were making a deal or something.

Here's my short anecdote:  I use to rave about CF & their calamari. But over the years, the quality has dropped significantly. The calamari was taste-less and the plate was full of deep fried batter crumbs.  I ordered the Chicken Madeira- a dish that I usually order & ALWAYS have loved. My dish came out with golf-ball sized mushroom slices and a quarter inch thick layer of plastic textured cheese. My mashed potatoes were good, I'll give em' that.  Unfortunately, this chain restaurant has definitely evolved for the worse over the years. This will not be my go to restaurant when I'm craving some good American food.  In addition, my server was just plain slow. I'm sure she felt my death stare because a different server asked me if I was ready to order dessert....... 20 min after the original server had passed the menu.

Of course I know the Cheesecake Factory is disgusting and avoid it and chain restaurants of it's low-rung, overpriced caliber at all costs. But a friend's graduation lunch was hosted here and I had no choice. Out of what can only be described as an overwhelming (and clearly self-sacrificing to the point of physical and potentially gastrointestinal detriment) love for my BFF, I obliged.  I arrived and could smell the mixture of something sickeningly sweet, heavy cream, too much cheese and 16-year-old, overworked waiter sweat as soon as I entered the establishment. The place was a-bustle and a-shuffle with workers scrambling to accommodate throngs of graduates and their families and I immediately felt sorry for the staff as they hoisted ginormous portions more fitting for whole families than for one patron in front of folks. I navigated through tacky decor, oversized tables and beneath creepy imitation Vatican ceilings until I met up with my group and we began ordering. I ordered the Kale and Quinoa Salad and asked for the parm' and ""Lemon Vinaigrette"" on the side, in anticipation of what I figured would be a disgusting and muddy mess of a dressing. As could be guessed, the dressing (or horse slop, whichever you choose to believe) arrived in a silver saucer and looked to be the consistency and color of Dijon mustard. I asked the server if I could have a balsamic dressing instead, at which point she brought over a big ass bottle of balsamic and a bottle of olive oil and pretty much expected me to have at it.  This is the part where I return the salad and remind myself that I should've never expected anything other than this from the Cheesecake Factory, offenders of all things culinary and worthwhile.

The little crab cakes are freakin amazing! I also sampled plates of my family members and those were awesome too! The bang bang shrimp is excellent! The second time I went I got the dynamite shrimp with their sauce(no idea what it is) and the two together were such an amazing combo! The fillet mignon is really worth the price, only $30! Other places, you'd be paying like $40! Then comes the whole reason why I came here! The cheesecakes! They are big and bursting with flavor, like everything else in this restraunt! The first time I went, I got the 30th anniversary cake and that was awesome, especially for leftovers! The second time I went, I got the Hershey smores edition and that was the best cheesecake I have ever had in my life! The meals here are honestly not that expensive! For four people at the table for my birthday, we only played $121, which is not bad for all of the food here bursting with flavor! Another thing I like about this place is the service! Since I work at Safeway, I set the bar pretty low for people giving me service because I am told everyday to give quality service, which these guys are too! Both times, the waiter and waitress were so nice and they gave us really good menu suggestions! The filled the water every time and we got our food with no screw ups(All I care about)!

Why ask if we want a drink and then refuse to give us one? Towards the 4th time she asked, she was getting sarcastic and snarky towards us.             At this point, the waitress then ignored us again walking past our table (even though we had our hands raised like kids in school asking a question) and another waiter came and commented about how he 'saw how the waitress ignored us'.           He refilled our drinks, then I asked if it was too late to get a side of chicken. He asked why and I explained I didn't get any even though I ordered it. He offered his apologies, then asked if we'd like to see a manager. I said yes, but the manager never came. BUT I was given a side dish of chicken towards the end of the meal, free of charge. (A negative review all because of chicken? Stupid, I know, but it gets worse)     !!!    This review was only two stars because when I was contemplating getting soup early on in the evening, the spoon I was provided with had dried up bits of pasta severely stuck to it.

I would never recommend this place to anyone, ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE PETS - unprofessional management.  My sister, nephews, and I decided to have lunch at the restaurant after taking my dog to the park. We wanted to enjoy the patio seating outside of the restaurant, but we called ahead to make sure dogs are allowed - which they are. (Other Cheesecake Restaurants we've been to we're very accommodating to my dog EXCEPT the one in WALNUT CREEK.)  As we sat down, we were given horrible looks from the table across from us (a man and an older woman) because we had my dog with us. Note, my dog is a blue nose Pitbull. He is the sweetest dog but due to the Pitbull reputation, ignorant people discriminate right away.  As the waiter approached me, my dog was under the table and slightly growled but stopped immediately after I commanded him. Then the woman across made an unacceptable comment ""That's why you shouldn't bring dogs at restaurants"". Moments later, a manager named Cassandra came up to our table to let us know ""that people were complaining because your dog is barking"". First of all, my dog did NOT bark at anyone. If she didn't come to our table, then the other people wouldn't have noticed. She stated that many people were complaining, and that my dog was barking a lot, which was false. It was just that one IGNORANT person across from us that couldn't handle seeing a pitbull. This manager was accommodating to that one customer but NOT US. She basically made a scene and made us and the people around us feel so uncomfortable. If that's what you call a manager, then they should reevaluate her again.  We requested another manager to speak to, and AGAIN he was against our dog! He said that the other manager said my dog was barking at so many people including her which was such a big lie. The only thing that caused this commotion was the growl (which was immediately stopped) and the complaint of the other customer (that was not even part of anything - my dog did NOT bark at her nor even LOOKED her way) so I don't understand why they would cater to her and avoid our needs as customers also.  My sister and I decided to take our food to-go instead because we just felt unwelcomed!  But on a lighter note, we had two servers approach us to comfort us and let us know that they love my dog - a Pitbull.  This management could have handled this situation more professionally.

After eating some of my food I found hair in it. it was almost 6 inches long and white.when the manager came, he did not apologize and instead he was explaining that when they looked at the hair in the kitchen it was blond and they have no one with blond hair working in the kitchen. I got the feeling that he was trying to say that it was my hair which by the way is curly and almost 10 times longer. What really pissed me off was the fact that the one waiters who were serving us where blond and so were quite a few others and the manager was making it look like it is my hair, no apologies , bad attitude like I was a freaking liar. when the waiter brought the bill tossed it on the table and left, not a thank you or good night. My husband and I were so pissed and furious when we left there but since I am pregnant I said screw it i am not going to bother ruining my day for some stupid people who have no clue what customer service is.

859,John V C.,"San Francisco, CA",125,1,,1.0,2015-12-29,"I have never seen a display of racism that has been displayed tonight. At the The Cheesecake Factory located in Walnut Creek, the manager, who is Asian himself, (update: his name is Jason Shum) just clearly stated that my family and myself are Asian so we all look alike and that is the reason why we were not seated right away.  After we were seated, everything seemed to be normal. We were a table of 14 and when the manager told us that we were Asian and we look alike, he said it to one half of the table, the side where my parents, aunts and uncle, and I were seated at. The other side of the table was unaware till we told them what had happened. My sister, who was on the other side, then complained upon hearing this and the manager was in full denial that he had ever said anything. Later in the evening, the manager then came to our side of the table to check up on us and I told him that we did not appreciate his comments. He then tried to ask us which one of his employees said the comments (seemed like he was ready to throw one of his employees under the bus) and we told him it was him. He then got all defensive and started to argue and deny everything and he would not leave the table, even though we told him to leave several times, he just stood there and said that he never said that and that he has been in the restaurant business for 6 years (pointless to say, but whatever). He eventually left after standing at the edge of our table like an idiot for almost 10 minutes harassing us with his denial while we were trying to finish up our dinner. He clearly had no idea on how to handle the situation. The manager (Jason Shum) is clearly not fit to hold his manager position and should be release due to his incompetence and racism.  Other than the manager's incompetence, this would've been a typical Cheesecake Factory experience, nice services from the servers and good but overpriced food. However the manager ruined the night for my family and myself.

There was not enough chicken in our sandwich, then when they sent us more chicken, it looked undercooked and was not fully cut through. If your meal comes with sauce, the sauce can be pretty skimpy, so you may want to ask for more on the side. However, our waitress was very patient with us if we weren't happy about something.

Their ambiance isn't too shabby and people dress... Kind of nice I guess.). We had a good amount of respect for this place, coming here maybe once every month or so. This experience was by far the worst experience I've ever had here.  Wait time: We put our name down and they said it would be about an hour to an hour and a half wait. So we waited. And waited. And waited. A little less than two hours went by and still nothing. We stood by where they called the names so it's not like we didn't hear them. I asked them about our table only to be told they called our name already. Then they said that we would get the next available table. They called several other two party names but still didn't say our name. It's not like they mispronounced it... It's Jon. How hard can that be. So about thirty more minutes went by before I asked them again what the status of our table was. They replied by telling me that they had already called our name and seated us. Food: I ordered the chicken Marsala and substituted the pasta for a salad. It wasn't bad but it seems like it was done cooking and sitting out from the looks of it. There was a film already formed on the sauce. As for the salad, it was extremely bland. If you like a Caesar salad with a tiny big of sauce, over fried croutons, and browning lettuce then this is perfect for you. On a positive note, the fried macaroni was good. Only problem was that they skimped out on the sauce this time. They usually have more. Either way I do recommend it.  Service: The service was extremely unresponsive. They didn't do anything to make up for what they did. I think because it wasn't our waitresses fault, she felt like it wasn't her problem. She even decided to disappear for 10 minutes and this was when we were finished eating too.   Overall I would have to say that this experience was just disappointing",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=200,2.88,3.06,3.108,2.5960000000000005,2.9880000000000004

276,Astrid Z.,"Berkeley, CA",498,617,1529.0,3.0,2016-03-21,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my leave favorite places to dine, but I will be unbiased and compare it fairly to other locations. Food: My main reason for not appreciating TCF is due to their HUGE and over the top menu. It's just way too long and I find that because of this, nothing is truly special, nothing stands out to me. I like smaller menus, it makes me feel like they invest more time into crafting these dishes. But I think they succeed with this tactic, because they attract a wider audience since they offer so much. I had the Tortilla Salad with chicken. the Salad was HUGE, like the menu. The ingredients tasted pretty fresh, aside for the beans, which were clearly canned. The chicken wasn't the best in taste, but the portion was definitely fair. I wouldn't get it again, nothing stand-out about it. Price: The portions are big here, for the most part & quality is okay for the price.  Ambiance: Huge restaurant, lots of seating, lots of waiting too. Very clean and can be noisy during dinner and the lunch rush. Service: It wasn't good. Our waiter was not attentive and very forgetful. It was a busy time during dinner, however, I noticed her attending the people around us a lot better than she attended us.

726,Jessie O.,"Danville, CA",52,213,81.0,3.0,2016-03-26,"We came to The Cheesecake Factory around 8:00pm on a Thursday evening. We waited about 30 minutes for a table along with about 20-30 other people. I think we hit the end of the dinner rush. In hindsight I might have made a reservation. They have a great waiting/sitting area outside with heaters and a fire pit where you can sip drinks while checking your buzzer for a table every couple minutes. The Cheesecake Factory is my favorite chain restaurant for a romantic evening. The ambiance is great with the dim lighting and fancy aesthetic. I feel like I'm high rolling while I'm there. It feels like I'm dining at a high end resort. Unfortunately, the prices are fairly comparable with high end resort dining without the dining room views over a lake or golf course or the option of retiring to your luxury suite after the meal. My husband's mediocre salad was about $16, the same price as my fettucine alfredo (without the additional meat, which is extra). Both entrees seemed priced high. That's why we don't come here very often. It's a treat. My husband's barbeque ranch chicken salad came with frozen (yes, FROZEN!) tomatoes. That was the tip off that the tomatoes weren't fresh or hand chopped. Everything tasted like it was from a can he said and that he would feed the leftovers to our pet chicken. My fettucine alfredo was fine. We ordered the Adam's Peanut Butter  blah blah Ripple something cheesecake to go following our meal. After a couple days since we dined, it's still untouched in the fridge so I can't yet comment on it. But, it's the same cheesecake I always get when I dine at The Cheesecake Factory. It's my favorite, so hopefully they didn't screw that up. All in all, I enjoyed our dining experience for the most part, but since my husband already has to compromise to come here since he doesn't like it, it didn't help that his salad was so awful.

The buffalo wings were over cooked dry and hard, asked him to refund this order, he still was debating if he should do it or not, told him to take this to the back and eat it and see how hard and dry the chicken is. Got our bill and he didn't refund our order. So the bottom line he lost us as future customers and now gets a 1 star review.

They do not take reservations so that sucked because once we got there you would think they were giving food away! Soooo many people! The hubby got a buzzer thingy and the daughter and I went shopping across the street. The wait was 30 minutes or so but it wasn't so bad because we were shopping. Hubby called us and off we went to meet him out in the patio. It was cold and the heater was not working or something so that didn't make me happy. Food was OK. Dessert however was AWESOME! Service was ok too. Our waitress kept forgetting little things like a spoon for my tea, 1/2 our drinks, silverware for my son. She was sweet though and it was her first day without her supervisor. She was also the waitress to a huge group behind us so she was a bit frazzled. Anyway I got the lemon raspberry cheesecake and it was so yummy.

We waited for 25 minutes to get a table on a Sunday evening and were seated at 8:30 PM at the back of the restaurant, where the service staff was dropping trays on the floor with noise while waiting for a waiter/ress to show and no one came to our table for 15 minutes. Then one server approached after I flagged a few of them, right after I suggested to leave the place, and took drink orders and we ordered a bottle of wine for our table. The server returned  again,  after 10 minutes with the bottle already opened. Requested that the bottle we ordered be open at our table, when the server said he just opened it. The server left to get an unopened bottle to be opened at our table when another server who was helpful and greeted us while waiting for our table, came by with a new bottle, opener, opened the bottle and poured for us and went back to the lounge area that was her station.  Our Server returned and took our order after yet another 15 minutes. He took our order and returned 10 minutes later to tell us that the app we ordered was sold out. I just laughed at how everything was ridiculous and having had a fun birthday all day, I was not going to let the evening be ruined. So we ordered an alternative. He took the rest of our dinner order. One of our dinner order was not done right, but by this point we just decided will pack the food, of course everyone knows the portions, finish our wine and leave, and from my point never return. It was such a place to take a group, but there are plenty other ones a step away to take people  The food was nothing to write about, ordinary, bland.

My group started out split up in booths, but were able to switch to open tables so we could mingle together more.

I called to let the manager know because paying $55 for 2 meals - 1 of which went uneaten, warranted a call into the manager. I spoke with Rafael who offered for me to pick up another dish - no thank you (this would pose a huge inconvenience). He then offered me a GC and placed me on a 20 minute hold. The wait was so long that I had to hang up and call back. To my surprise, Rafael was there at the front desk. I realized he either has a very bad short term memory and forgot that he placed a customer on hold OR he wasn't pleased with having to make the situation right. In any case, I WILL NOT ever be back. His poor excuse for the hold was that he didn't have a pen/paper to take down my information. I think a trip to Staples would have been quicker than my hold time.

To start off, the seating usually isn't too bad as long as you're not in a rush. They're a very popular place so don't expect to be seated immediately in the middle of a dinner rush or a weekend evening. They take your name down & give you a buzzer to let you know when your table is available with plenty of seating to wait & you could even wait outside without missing your chance to be seated. You can also grab a drink at the bar! The interior is beautiful! Very high ceilings, awesome lighting depending on the mood of you & your guests. Plenty of seating both inside & outside, we've eaten at both places there's a fire pit & heaters outside if you end up out there. The menu itself has PLENTY of options no matter what your preference may be. I'm personally a huge fan of the Chicken Madeira & their pasta is also good. You're also served bread & butter when you're seated. As far as drinks go, the menu is just as extensive. The Asian pear martini is my favorite, introduced to me by my boyfriend & I'm never disappointed! I've always received good service here & that just about rounds out the reasons I come here so often.

The hostess should set the tone for the experience and she does...in a very negative way.

322,KellyAnn J.,"Guerneville, CA",64,120,215.0,1.0,2016-07-15,"I finally made it to a Cheesecake Factory. Since I am a big fan of anything cheesecake I was excited. Maybe my expectations were high. Maybe I make a better cheesecake than I realized. But, it was less than mediocre IMHO.  I stopped in alone as I needed a break to go over some paperwork and wanted a cool place to rest in between my busy plans. It was a beautiful, huge place with a grand entrance and spectacular decor. That is where the greatness stopped.  I waited too long before my server came to my table. I ordered a slice of chocolate mousse cheesecake after telling my server I was excited about being here for my very first time. There were no suggestions from him, and he brought it back relatively quick.  It seemed too old to me. The Oreo like  crust was bitter and a bit slimey on the bottom. The mousse too was flat, loose and seemed like it wasn't made anytime recently. The cheesecake part was good in the middle but the chocolate shavings on the top were few and once again, kinda slimey -ewww.  I pushed the slice around with my fork, trying bites here and there and became more unhappy with each bite. By the time I was done I disassembled it to eat only the middle. The edges tasted wrong. And the crust was awful.  When my server finally showed back up to ask how it was, I had been pushing it around my plate for far too long. I then explained my opinion in a very polite way. He understood that I did not like it at all, and in fact I thought it was stale or old. He then suggested I try his favorite: the ""tuxedo"" next time and described it. Now he makes a suggestion? A bit late for me... I felt slighted about my old slice.  He then took my plate, as I wasn't eating any more of it, and took awhile to bring me my tab and then surprisingly disappeared for another 12 minutes ( I counted because I wanted to leave, but needed change) I had a $20 waiting for that tab, but he dropped it and ran away before I could slip it inside. That 12 minutes wait (too long)left me thinking he maybe was going to bring me a fresher piece of cheesecake. But NO, just the tab. So I left a dollar tip and was sorry I had come to the Cheesecake Factory. Note: my visit was on Thursday afternoon, July 14th between 4-5pm. The place had very few customers at that hour. There seemed to be lots of employees. So I see no reason for such poor service. In addition, the stale cheesecake with no offer to give me a fresher slice was unacceptable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=100,2.6,2.91,3.048,2.02,2.7860000000000005
908,Steve R.,"Walnut Creek, CA",3,31,2.0,2.0,2016-07-18,"I have never been a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory as I find it very canned and over-done. The food while serviceable, seems to border on coming out of a big bucket with just enough alteration to make it appear hand-made. That notwithstanding, my frustration with CF begins well before the dinner. In celebration of a birthday and the need to get in an early dinner, we called for a reservation for 11 people at 5:00pm out on the patio (on a Thursday). We arrive at 5 pm and are told that 80% of our party needs to be before we can be seated but our table is ready. 5:10pm and all our party arrives. We let them know we are all here and they say it will be just moment. A moment turns into 25 mins and we still have not gotten seated. We ask the host to ""speed it up, lets go"" and he replies ""your server will be here in 2 mins to seat you, but not all your party was here at 5"". 2 mins turn into 10mins. At this point, the host essentially lied and more exasperating is; the patio is essentially empty with seats galore to chose from. Two members of our party go over to where one wait staff is trying to put the table together (oh wait so it wasn't ready?), at which point we begin putting the tables together with him and begin setting our own table. We sit down. You'd thought we just told them the earth was flat, because they had no idea what to do now. They weren't able to generate that goofy little computer seating receipt and the waiter was unable to follow the CF's inane seating policy. Why is it, they can take a reservation, but they actually can't execute on the reservation? The table wasn't set at 5:30pm let alone 5:00pm. This is CF's SOP though. Come in, tables vacant everywhere and wait for 10-15 minutes. In our case 45 mins for something that should be as easy as making Cheesecake. 5:00 reservation = table ready with 11 seats and flatware, napkins etc. Everyone in our party was disappointed with their very rookie, second-rate, bush-league attitude. The food was OK... it has gotten incredibly bland though and cafeteria-esque - I would move on from CF. There are many, many other restaurants in WC to choose from.

Anyways he explained a couple of specials that they were having and recommended the fish. He then got our drink orders and came back maybe 5 minutes with the drinks and bread basket.  Then we sat for the next 15 minutes waiting for him to come back to take our order, but sat there instead as he took another tables order who was seated after us. Another server came up to our table with out any introduction and asked if we were ready and finally took our orders.  We sat for another 25 minutes for our appetizer to come out (by the way we ordered spinach and cheese dip... Nothing too complicated). As we began to eat the chips and dip a man in a dress shirt approached our table which was by far the most awkward interaction i have ever had at a restaurant with the restaurants manager... He began to apologize for how slow the appetizer came out and said ""it normally doesnt take this long and i do apologize for the wait but we had to make it from scratch which is why it took longer than normal...""  On a side note i know this probably sounds very petty but i ordered a factory burrito with no onions and when the server dropped off the food he even said heres the burrito with no onions.... And with the first bite i tasted and saw a bunch of onions fall out of the burrito.  After a few minutes the server came back and asked if we had spoken to the manager and if he took care of us which i replied ""well he said hi and apologized"" and the server responded with ill speak with him and make sure he'll take care of you guys.

Its been a while since I've been there, but some negative things Ive found about the restaurant were: Customer Service was a bit of an issue; employees spilling drinks on people (only happened once), drinks and food take for ever to come out, some employees can be somewhat forgetting, and 50% of the time, the food comes out the wrong way (either under/over cooked).

619,Angie D.,"Davis, CA",0,1,,1.0,2016-08-29,"I am a huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory, but this location was just disappointing. My boyfriend and I went for dinner 3 days ago and were treated very poorly by one of the hosts. He told us the wait time was approximately 15 minutes and to wait on the side of the host table. He never gave us a buzzer because he said our name would be called when a table was available (which is complete bs because the manager said they're required to give you a buzzer). 20 minutes had passed and we noticed that several people were being seated before us, so we asked another hostess how much longer we had to wait. She looked at her list and told us there were 5 more parties of 2 that were before us. We said okay and continued to wait on the side. More and more people were getting seated and we realized that 50 minutes had passed. I finally stopped the host who gave us the initial wait time and asked him what was going on. He asked for our name, talked to the other hostesses, and came back and told us that someone had messed up. He then walked us to a table while we kept asking him questions about what had happened. First, he said someone else messed up and then he said our name was put on hold because he called it out 4 times. I was furious at this point. We waited right next to the host table for 50 minutes and not once did anyone call our name. Shortly after, he changed the story and said that he didn't call our name, but someone else did. So in other words, he lied to our face. Twice. He then said in verbatim, ""Well, here's your table."" He did not apologize nor take responsibility for his actions. Instead he gave us attitude, tried to make us feel like we were the ones who were wrong, and failed to provide at least decent customer service. This was all on top of giving us a completely inaccurate wait time.  We were so upset that we decided to just leave. We spoke to a manager and she apologized and reserved a table for us. We were so over it at this point and waited long enough so we decided to stay and eat there. We had a great server so that was the only good thing out of this whole experience. While the manager did try to compensate by giving us free dessert, it did not make up for the host's behavior and inability to do his job. I understand that people make mistakes but he could have just apologized and not lied. I would have been much more forgiving and probably wouldn't have even called for a manager.

The redeeming person in this whole experience was our waitress, Rheena, because she asked how we were, and when she heard our frustration, she asked what she could do to make us feel better. We asked for a complimentary cocktail, which she could not do but she offered us a complimentary dessert instead.  That simple gesture made up for the sins of the hostess.  And our dinner was very good too.   I think last night's hostess needs better training - she was in over her head on a very busy night.  She is the first person a customer interacts with in your restaurant - it should be imperative that the initial customer experience be flawless.  For us, it wasn't.

I called in and was placed on hold, no big deal.  After minute 8 of being on hold (I know, I'm an idiot for even waiting that long) I had someone else call to see if they could get through.  While I'm still on hold, the call was picked up and the order was placed.  This was mildly annoying, but whatever...  was told that it would be ready in 25 mins. Arrived to pick up 20 minutes later and paid and waited for the food which was just a burger and fries (yes, I was feeling fancy and decided I wanted a burger from cheesecake).  The wait continued and continued, finally decided to ask if the food was ready or when they expected it to be ready, with no apology or anything the cashier said she would check, walked back to the kitchen and came back with the food.  How long had it been sitting there?  Anyways, 47 minutes after the order was placed (checked the call log) I finally had the food.   The burger was ordered medium and came out well done, like really well done.  It was still good, but not how I wanted it.  The fries were a really small portion.  The bag was filled up about 1/5 of the way.  Luckily they were not cold and they have a good bag for the fries that has holes in it and seems like it was constructed in a way that retains the heat, but also doesn't cause the fries to get soggy.  That actually probably earned the second star on this visit, b/c I've never seen that before and after everything else that had happened, I sort of expected awful soggy fries at that point. The restaurant was not that busy at the time and things didn't seem like they were being run very well.

After years, decades, even, of hearing the hype, and that one celebrity who swears by it, I found it to be on the low end of Mediocre. We got there at opening time on a Thursday. The staff seemed sad to see us walk in. The drinks server was good, no problem there.  As we waited, we had opportunity to observe the staff in action. There was a lot of yelling across the open space amonst the servers. Not sure what it was about, but they seemed oblivious to the presence of customers. At one point, a server passing by our table shouted so loudly that I got an Adrenalin rush, right down to the tingly fingers. And I'm not that easily rattled. It was as though we did not exist in her world.  Add to this the hard environment -- tile floor, faux marble columns, etc. -- couple with the oppressive, even assaultive loud music, and the noise level was such as to dampen the taste buds. Also, for heaven's sake, CF, have a word with yourself: that's the most obnoxious mix of music I've ever heard in a restaurant. There is plenty of non-aggressive music in the world. Another comment regarding staff: Management needs to direct staff to forego perfume, especially cheap aftershave. Apart from the fact that many people are sensitive to such chemicals, the taste of them on the tongue detracts from the food. Okay, that covers service, atmosphere, noise, and offensive odors. On to the food! I had the Vietnamese spring/summer rolls. They were built well, with apparently fresh ingredients, and I liked the dipping sauces, especially the hot chili one. But they were permeated with a a stale refrigerator smell and taste.  The Baja fish tacos would have been acceptable, except they were served lukewarm. The black beans were lukewarm and bland. The rice was lukewarm and tasteless. Possibly left over rice from the previous day? Hard to tell, but I wouldn't be surprised. The original cheesecake was way below mediocre. I've had better from a frozen box.  I see that management's response to other comments runs along the lines of ""Why didn't you discuss this with your manager?"" Good question, why didn't I? Because it's not a problem with a single meal, or a bad day. Obviously, the place is operating as designed, and the staff is operating as trained. I didn't care to have an unpleasant conversation to state the obvious. Why do you need to be told, CF, that loud, smelly, overblown environment combined with sub-mediocre lukewarm food is not acceptable. Stop blaming customers, get your act together. And don't you think that 80 bucks for lunch for two is insanely over the top? That's 1 beer, 1 cocktail, 1 entree, 1 appetizer, 1 slice of cheesecake. 80 bucks. Eighty. Bucks.

To begin, I don't understand why The Cheesecake Factory does not allow reservations or call ahead. For a party of about 12 people, we waited 1.5 hours to be seated. Keep in mind, seating in the waiting area is extremely limited. Upon being seated around 8:30PM and ordering drinks, it took at least 10 minutes before our waitress came back with our beverages. It took over an hour for our food to come out and by the time it did, I was not only HANGRY ( hungry/angry), I was equally disappointed. The Salmon and Shrimp Scampi combo ($22-$24) was laughable. 3, yes, 3 Shrimp were accompanied by a sliver of a piece of Salmon, it wasn't even 4oz at best. A clump of flavorless mashed potatoes and dry garnish were pretty much the feature of this dish. Our server was horrible! She wasn't very attentive and her overall attitude just wasn't friendly. On several occasions when we attempted to get her attention, we were ignored. Did she offer extra napkins? NO! Did she ask how dinner was? NO! Did she offer anything of value to our overall experience??!!! HECK NO! By 10:20PM, I just wanted to pay my tab and be gone, but of course that took our server forever in a day to do.

You've probably been to one a dozen of times (or more) and I've been going to this one ever since it opened up during my high school days. Birthdays, celebrations, girls night out, holiday weekend, family dinner... There seems to always be an occasion to treat yourself to a little ""fancy"" here. I get it, the food is overpriced. I can never deny me their Farfalle Pasta with Chicken and Mushrooms (my all-time favorite dish -- bow tie pasta in creamy garlic, oh it's dangerous!). Though their dishes can come at $15-$25 a plate, they can be tasty. Their salmon with asparagus and mashed potatoes is ALWAYS a classic. (They serve up a little something for everyone.) If you're trying to save a little money, their plates are always big portions that are perfect to split with a friend (thank you Mom). You can hardly ever leave here without buying a slice of cheesecake. (Or else you're weird.) I'm a simple girl and go for their classic Fresh Strawberry cheesecake. Every. Darn. TIME. Classic cheesey cheesecake flavor I love topped with luscious strawberries, strawberry sauce and some whipped cream. Take it to go for later if you so please! Their bread for the table is always dangerous. That brown rye bread with some butter... Carb overload! But so yummy! Just think when's the next time you'll come here? Probably in a few months. Maybe even a year. Do it and don't look back. (Taking home your entree was never bad.) The Walnut Creek location has always been a home location for me. The area has significantly gotten more ""upscale"" in recent months, but it fits the area well. Classy, nice ambiance, generally friendly and courteous waiters. Plus, you're in the middle of downtown Walnut Creek, so you can walk off your meal with a bunch of shopping or just lounge out at the movie theater. You can't love TCF, but you can't hate it either. It's got all the goods and ambiance and everything you'd expect from a sit-down eatery (love their outdoor patio for a nice day out). You will be spending a bit much for food that doesn't always wow, but it's an experience here. And I've never had anything really bad to say about them here! P.S. It's almost always dark in all Cheesecake's I've been to. Thus, your photos won't look great.

I wait ten minutes to have my order taken, not only because they are busy - but the two cashiers were missing in action for the ten minutes I was waiting. So I finally place my order. After 10-12 minutes I come back and ask the cashier, how will i know its ready, do you call out a number, he says no, we call out the cheesecake. Ok, poor way of organization in a busy place but whatever. Meanwhile there are about a dozen cheesecakes on their counter in to go packages waiting to be picked up - but no one is calling them out! I wait another ten minutes, I think I may have heard one cheesecake called out during that time, and it wasn't for me. I went to the cashier and told him, after 25 minutes now,  if my cheesecake is not ready I want my money back. He looks down and there is my cheesecake that has been sitting there for 20 minutes - I remember seeing it when I went to the cashier the previous time. So much for calling out the cheesecakes. Totally unacceptable service for a paying customer. But I do not blame this totally on the cashiers..it is primarily the MANAGER AT FAULT. If i could give a negative five stars I would. Everytime I go into this restaurant it is chaotic, completely unorganized, and the staff seems miserable. The only thing nice there was the cheesecakes. But that was my last visit - its got bad vibes and it seems the entire staff is unhappy. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY IN WALNUT CREEK. ITS CLEAR THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE A MANAGER RUNNING THIS STORE, NOR DO THEY TRAIN THEIR EMPLOYEES.

Someone had made a mess in one of the stalls and it smelled like homeless people had been cleaning themselves in there. Also, the waste baskets were overflowing with used paper towels.

652,Michael W.,"Lafayette, CA",0,5,18.0,1.0,2017-01-04,"My review is based on the way this restraunt is run and NOT so much the food. My hope is that someone from corporate will read this and try to make some changes because my family and I are HUGE fans of the food there. I have called to place togo orders there at least 10 times and ALWAYS and I mean ALWAYS I wait on hold for approx 15-20 minutes. The last 2 times I have called I have waited on hold for over 30 minutes...the last being 37 minutes. One might ask, what kind of idiot would wait that long on hold...well ME I guess. But the reason is, I call from my house or business, get in the car and wait on hold. Last week I walked in while STILL being on hold (34 mins of hold) looked for a manager, couldn't find one and then left to go eat elsewhere. It is AWFUL and at least 30% of the time my order is wrong if I do get to order and pick it up. Second, when we eat IN the restaurant, ALMOST always...our food will come out at completely different times. Sometimes upwards of 5 to 10 minutes different. So half the table is either eating while the other half waits OR their food gets cold while we wait. And the CHERRY ON TOP...This year I decided to have them cater my xmas party....So I called (and yes I waited on hold for EVER) got a person...ordered close to $800 worth of food for pick up 2 days later. Was told I would get a call back in 15 minutes to verify the order, amount and pick up time. 2 hours later I had no call. SO, I called back...(yes, waited on hold) got a person, my order was found, UN COMPLETED (pricing etc) in the system. I re-ordered, verified the entire order TWICE with the lady and verified pick up....On the night of the party December 11 at 4:30 when the order was to be ready, I showed up and .....wait for it.....YEP....NOBODY COULD FIND THE ORDER AND IT WASN'T COOKED OR READY!.....Now, I had over 40 people waiting at my business waiting to eat, drink etc. And I now have NO food. After finding a manager and explaining my ""problem"" she found my order in the system and after her doing all she could, I ended up waiting over an hour PLUS..I had people waiting at the party venue, cold, hungry, etc....my kids in the car and my year end xmas party was officially a ball of stress. So the head manager, who didn't even have the decency to come talk to me told the VERY NICE and pregnant manger to ""take of the price of the Apps....."" I was soooo disgusted AND had people waiting that I couldn't say anything or dispute this any further, I had to rush to the party....I talked with the manager who was doing what she could in her capacity and she essentially said, her hands were tied. I am a business owner and do NOT like negativly reviewing businesses but I feel like this one just needs to get SOMEONE to take charge of management down there and get it fixed. Because the food is great and the location is perfect but whoever is running it from a management point of view would be fired 5 times over in my business. I HOPE this finds SOMEONE in corporate and they do something to fix these VERY fixable issues. And Thank you to the pregnant manager who did what she could to solve the immediate issue that fateful night.  Here's to hoping!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=460,2.76,2.78,2.816,2.6280000000000006,2.772

Maybe it's the location and how close it is to us and things around it that we like. Anyway, the cheesecake factory always finds a new way to disappoint us. So here is todays gross story. We ordered 2 waters and when I finished my water, I noticed that there was water left inside the bottom of the glass even though it was empty. The glass also looked strange. When I realized what this was (after I drank the glass), I was disgusted. It was a glass saucer that was stuck in the bottom with dirty water around it (and in my glass). I immediately asked for a manager and showed it to him. He offered a free slice of cheesecake which is great but still disgusting. How this happens is beyond me but it shouldn't happen. This restaurant in general has cleanliness problems and the silverware is often very dirty.

233,Andy L.,"Berkeley, CA",1558,217,1314.0,4.0,2017-01-13,"Where do you begin with talking about the Cheesecake Factory? I guess with cheesecake... Oh how decadent the cheesecakes are! My favorites are Chocolate Raspberry Truffle, Key Lime, Cherry, anything with chocolate and most important, the Banana Cream! Bananananana! On a serious note, looks can be deceiving, as it's strongly represented by 1 burger in particular. Don't get me wrong, I think all their dishes, from pastas to seafood to burgers are all delicious. The problem from that 1 burger I mentioned stems from the meat, Kobe Beef! *IMPORTANT!: it's often assumed that a Kobe Burger will contain actual Kobe Beef. Dead Wrong!  There are 8 restaurant, Correction! 9 restaurants in the U.S. that are certified to serve real Kobe Beef.  Therefore, their Kobe Beef burger is as good as ostrich, if not worse! Of these 9 restaurants, The Cheesecake Factory isn't one of them to make the list. 2 factors that characterize Kobe Beef is the marbled texture which melts in your mouth when you eat it and second, the price which should be reflective to the real cost of $55 dollars an ounce; nowhere in comparison to the $15 dollar burger by The Cheesecake Factory.  I've ordered this item several times reluctantly knowing it's not close to the real thing. Fun fact: Wagyu Beef (or Kobe as we call it in the states) is from pure bred cattle raised on a special diet in Japan. I've witnessed the cattle getting massages and special treatment...with a 'happy ending' of course! The A5 Quality Grade entitles the beef as being the very best; this was more of A1, C1 Grade. Another giveaway to the fake meat was when I asked my most recent waitress where the Kobe came from. She replied by saying she didn't know, as it seems the past waiters didn't know either.  My stomach always enjoys itself at The Cheesecake factory and sometimes, I get so full that there's absolutely no room for dessert, which is essentially the reason I came. The easy fix is to eat dessert first and take home the main course as leftovers.   Another word of advice: do ask how much a drink is if you're all about the mix drinks. I should've known better to ask how much a Long Island was before I actually ordered it. I'm used to my Long Island's being in a Highball, not a Stemless Bourbon Glass in which my Long Island was in. The drink cost me $11.50 and I finished it in only 2 measly sips... 4 Mississippi's  TLDR: long story short, be careful what you order! Kobe Beef is fake at most places! Cheesecake is yummy!  --------------- --------------- Overall experience: 8/10 food, service and ambience Water quality: 8.5/10",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=20,2.64,2.75,2.796,2.9600000000000004,2.7060000000000004

My wife posed the question to me why we didn't get seated nearer to the heater.  As they sat  all the middle aged Caucasian couples right beneath the heater, it became clear that they sat us further because we were a 20 something couple of color and they wanted better tips. It's offensive, to say the least.

I'm not sure if they have changed their recipe but whatever is going on, it's pretty bad. To wait 50 minutes on a Saturday night and have food like this is unacceptable.

That was fine with me and joined the others that where waiting for their tables. What was beyond me was that there where plenty of tables open. Maybe they can only seat as many people as workers they have during the weekday? After I was seated our server came by within minutes. Asked us for drinks and if we were ready to order. Everything was fine up to this point.  After waiting 30 minutes our server walked by and noticed that we did not have our food. She informed us that it would just be a few more minutes. We talked amongst ourselves for about 20 more minutes. Then finally a gentleman holding one plate comes to our table without saying a word points at our food indicating where should he place the plate. He never said anything else or even smiled. He did not even recall what the dish he placed was or said anything about the other dish. He walked away with a smug face. Okay dude, what's your problem. He comes five minutes later with my food, and you know the jelly like film sauces get when it sits out because of the oil. Yeah I had that. My food was not hot or warm. It was room temperature. They did not even care enough to clean the plates as I saw sauce and butter around the edges. My boyfriends burger was slightly warm as well. He ordered a burger with mac & cheese. The mac & cheese ball was placed in the center. I guess they cut the center of the beef patty and replace it with the mac and cheese. It was hard to find someone to ask for condiments and it was hard to find my server as she only came to our table about 3 times. (To order, to tell us our food is coming, and for the check)  The food was not outstanding. It's as generic as food can get. They list the calories on the menu. I'm wondering all the calories go to. The protein to starch ratio is beyond me. They put a huge portion of mashed potato with a small piece of protein and whole bunch of buttery oily sauce. & the fries are hard and not even warm!  The ambiance is nice, I guess. That's what I give the stars for. The cheesecake is alright. For the price, people do not deserve microwaved food (basically).

Was there a week ago and the pasta wasn't even spicy like it should've been and both plates were sauceless and dry as hell.  When we asked for extra sauce due to how dry the pasta was it took them another 10 minutes and by the time the waiter bought the sauce the pastas were completely cold. come on cheesecake factory what happened to those delicious pastas ???,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=260,2.8,2.86,2.836,2.732,2.836

541,Murat A.,"Moraga, CA",1,11,,1.0,2017-03-18,"My family had one of the most frustrating dining experiences in this particular location, from customer service to food. It was a chain of events that really turned our Friday night family dinner into a complete headache. First, getting a table... We were told there was a 20 min wait, which was totally acceptable for a Friday. Then at the 20th minute, I go to the front desk to check what's happening and learn that my name is not in the system, there was a ""technical problem"". Saying so sorry, they said now they would expedite our table. Then passes another 20 min, people who came long after us start getting tables, I ask again and they say again sorry, don't know what happened, and now promise to get a table for us right away. And in another 10 min close to 50 min mark, they say our table is ready. By that time, my 3 yr old was starving (going from a 20 min wait to 50 min) and was fussy and we all were feeling exhausted because of such a long wait. So at this point, you would assume they would try to make up for all the frustration. But wait. They show us a table for 2 people! Literally, one of those narrow tiny ones, and suggest bringing over a high chair for my kid, for which there clearly is no room. And going back and forth between the front desk, we finally get a booth, at the 1 hr mark. And the food. What a story. My kid's food, which was supposed to come asap, comes 5 minutes after our food. My wife ordered steak tacos, which came cold, tasted way below mediocre, with tiny amount of rice they put on the side, which was very very dry. I ordered a Shephard's pie. To my surprise, it did not come as a ""pie"" but was basically ground beef and veggies mixed in a bowl with mashed potatoes on top! I had to reconfirm that I got the right meal, because if looked so not like a pie. The taste was way below average, for the $15-20 price mark.

226,Jessica W.,"Walnut Creek, CA",248,128,266.0,4.0,2017-03-25,"I've been going to this location for years and it does not change for better or for worse.  Waiting times: Can be excruciatingly long to get a table for dinner, especially since they do not take reservations. Luckily they have a nice outdoor patio for waiting, but if you have a large group, go early or late. Otherwise you can wait for several hours.  Food: Cheesecake Factory is known for their large portions. With large portions comes loads of calories. They do have ""skinny options"" but it's not what they're known for.  Chicken Bellagio- My personal favorite. The basil pesto pasta is always consistent and delicious. It's a bit greasy and creamy from the pesto but nevertheless satisfying. The chicken is a large amount and cooked fully with a crunchy exterior. I love the arugula and prosciutto on top which add texture and freshness. Overall the portion is HUGE and I always expect to have leftovers, which is a good thing.  French Dip- not the best French dip, but definitely a satisfying amount of food. Lots of French fries which is a plus. The bread is nicely toasted and buttered but the meats and filling are not very well balanced and was a bit salty.  Hazelnut Cheesecake- If you love Nutella, you'll love this cheesecake. It's not too heavy or rich like other cheesecakes but will definitely meet any hazelnut cravings.  White Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake- One of my favorites for not being too sweet. My favorite part is the chocolate crust, it's perfection and adds more depth.  Complimentary bread- Always makes a trip to Cheesecake worth for the warm slices of bread and butter.  Overall, cheesecake has huge portions, is very consistent, not a healthy option and may or may not be worth the wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek,2.8,2.88,2.824,2.8960000000000004,2.848

I was unfortunately told by one of your Cheesecake Factory wait staff then told by the manager nothing can be done about this problem. I've personally worked in the food industry before and know a transaction as simple as this can be reversed and recharged and therefore fixed. Here is the situation: My waitres told me  my gift cards were ""not good"". I've had these cards for several years and I've been waiting to use them for a very special occasion, for a very long time. It was extremely disappointing to be told they are null and void, since they were a Christmas gift from my grandmother. Allowing room for error I decided to speak to someone in management. Upon explaining to the manager that the gift cards were said ""not good"" it turns out that the cards indeed  we're good and did have the said cash on them.  After finding this out the manager refused to reverse the transaction and fix it. I have 2 gift cards with $25 on them each. Totaling $50. I was told there is ""nothing i can do and that I could use them another time"". This was not than frustrating. On top of all this it was a birthday dinner for my older brother to which they nearly forgot to sing the happy bday song, (a part of the night we were all looking forward to) On 3 occasions I had my fiancé ask to tell them; First when we arrived, second after we placed our order and then when the cheesecake arrived there was no song. That's when I had him go ask for the THIRD time. Finally they came with a scoop of ice cream in a cup and sang. Unfortunately there was so much disappointment the song was just awkward. I forgot to mention how my mom had told the waitress her turtle Cheesecake was hard to eat because it was overwhelmingly peanutbutter flavored. The waitress smiled as if not to hear a word my mother said so my  mother grudgingly finished her unsatisfactory slice. I didn't want to appear forward and ask for a replacement slice. Which I feel now I should have just asked. I understand the stress of a Saturday night in the restaurant industry. However that is what tips are for ""To Insure Promt Service"". I've eaten at Cheesecake many times in the past and  have never received such dissatisfactory service. I can't believe I forgot to mention the alc beverage  that I ordered and did not receive. I'm just blown away at the unacceptable service this night. Not to mention the cob salads my mother and brother both ordered were laden in iceberg lettuce lacking the said bacon and many other listed ingredients the menu had promised. I really hope Someone takes the time to read this and get back to me As soon as possible. I would have no problem sending in the reciepts for a refund. if that is not possible at least be comped for the drink I never received & my mother and brothers birthday cob salads and possibly the  overwhelmingly peanut butter flavored turtle cheesecake (she did eat the majority of the cake slice so I will understand if the last request is not met).

360,Veronica S.,"Patterson, CA",0,47,45.0,2.0,2017-04-13,"Bad service terrible server Lissette. So listen up Lissette (Idk how to spell your name, my apology)! First of all we get seated to a handicap booth; my friend who's not as skinny as me gives me the eye of this is so embarrassing because she's a bigger girl. So I told them there is a lot of other open boothes, I know you not gunna try to squeeze us in this booth. So they agreed to give us a normal size booth. We where seated and asked for drinks from our waitress Lisette who grabbed them in a good amount of time. Now she gave our drinks to us backwards and I said politely oh here it's like this no worries. She then disappeared we did not see our waitress Lisette for quite sometime,maybe 15 mins to take our order. So I got up to the station of the cashier little booth by the bar and asked for her. Weird enough she was in the little booth behind a gentleman who was working there. So it took her 5 mins more which was a while granted because we where the boothes closest to the bar. So I gave her my order that she didn't apologize for the 20 min wait or even show one sign of sympathy or even a smile. I told her my order and she didn't write it down or acknowledge me if that was it, just super awkward. Then off like a flash she ran away kinda like a mean girl that she didn't want to talk to us lower class subjects haha. My friend who has worked as a manager for restaurant told me how sad they didn't give her enough trainer and how she didn't look like she even taken care of her self.Like she should  fixed her pony tail and maybe someone should tell her to lay off the blush but I'm not here to poke at her image god knows I had no makeup on with ugg slippers lol but No excuse for Lisenette she is at her job so let the record show : you should present yourself at work a bit higher on the spectrum. So she disappeared for all of the meal and I had to call over the manager tell him about my situation and on top of that I had a really bad bent butter knife as well. After that the meal came after waiting a hour for fish tacos and a turkey sandwich ; didn't help that the server that wasn't even our server spilled my friends fries all over the floor! I felt bad for the guy but it's like another yet embarrassing thing to happen to us. The manager did take care of our desert which was fabulous but he should train his staff better. Oh that's right what happen to Lisnette or Lisette, she never showed her face not even once! Disappointed and I left no tip to my ghost server. So Lisette or linsette I will discuss what you need to work on help you out because I was a cocktail waitress back in the day!  1. Smile  2. Be friendly and usually have a opening Example: Hello good after noon how are we doing today? Good me to! 3. If you mess up or are late with you customers Say: I apologize for the inconvenience I'm very busy and let me get started for you on your order or if the customers food is late go over say ""hi can I refill your drinks?""  4.Don't let your customer ever wait always check on them! Update on food is always so helpful!! 5. Ask them if there's anything else they can do after serving your food! 6. Check on them while they are eating  7. Tie it together at the end with desert and the bill 8.Appearance this is kinda like judging a book by the cover.Sounds bad but hey it's the truth. If you look like a hot mess people tend to not want that person serving food thinking maybe a loose hair will find a way in your food or the girl with too much makeup is distracting to look at. Always have a tight clean pony tail and natural makeup on it shows the customer you take care of your self and reassures their food will be handle with care with no hairs in it. Your tip should be excellent! I may look like a 14 year old little girl but I'm that undercover boss that will tip you $20 to $50 usually that's lunch tips for 2 girls haha image dinner tip! I had to tip 0 never in a very long time has this happened. So I hope this was helpful to the worst server Lisette or linsette.

One time about a month ago me and my boyfriend went to dinner and I got a chicken entree with a pasta and the chicken was amazing but the pasta was half uncooked. I didn't think much of it other than it was the only bad experience and the main part of my food was good. Then the time after I ordered the same thing and so did my boyfriend. This time the chicken which I had loved was really bland and didn't taste very good. Also the pasta wasn't good either. I thought the chicken was just mine but my boyfriends tasted the same.

There's paid meter parking available right next to the restaurant inside the structure and fairly cheap too. The restaurant itself is very nice, kept clean and organized. One trouble I had was locating the restroom, maybe a little sign would help (if there was one my fault for not seeing it) Our experience was great mainly due to our server Oscar. Although we came pretty late (9pm) he was still as energetic, polite and helpful as ever. Started off with drinks and bread as usual.  We did a basic 3 course meal-- crab dip for appetizer, pasta for entree, and of course, cheesecake for dessert! Personally for me the crab dip tasted a little different, but my date didn't mind it. The pasta was delicious as usual, however I ordered my pasta with chicken. When I got the plate... no chicken. After asking about it one other server (not Oscar) gave me a little attitude on how I didn't order it, which I clearly did lol. After waiting a few minutes we see Oscar rushing through to the kitchen then back to us, then back to the kitchen and back to us a few times to see if I got my chicken. Unfortunately I didn't, but I appreciate his effort and hustle. Fast forward to dessert, the Cheesecake was delish! 'Nuff said.  Overall, you're gonna get either a helpful server or a not so helpful server who's affected by the time period of the day. Was going to give a 3.5 if able to, but I'll just round it up to 4 stars.

The listed calories on the menu is a mixed bag:  Great to know, but hair-raising when you see the astronomical amounts contained in their meals.   If, however, the high calories really do bother you, no need to worry, cause they've got it covered with their Skinnylicious menu selection with loads of lower calorie options.  I had their skinnylicious chicken pot pie last night and it was wonderful. There is, however, one thing that I have always found perplexing about this restaurant.   For a place  that pumps out one great meal after another, why oh why, are their fries so terrible?  They're at the top of my list for worst fries ever.  In no way, do they compare to the rest of their perfected menu items.   There is often a wait time to get a table and in my experience, it can take quite a while for the food to come out of the kitchen. Last night however, everything went very smoothly and our waiter was outstanding.   I wish I would have taken the trouble to get his name All in all though, it's a great place and if you can't find anything on the menu that appeals to you, you should really just stay home and eat worms.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek,2.72,2.76,2.76,2.0,2.744

344,Brenda N.,"Danville, CA",0,14,2.0,1.0,2017-08-07,"We are a family of three (with young child) and Sunday night was a very frustrating dinner experience for us. We arrived at 6:50pm and waited 40 minutes to get seated (around 7:30pm). We placed our order immediately (as we've already waited so long to get seated) and were hoping to finally enjoy a relaxing dinner, BUT... 1) Our Pasta Da Vinci was missing chicken (we did not ask for vegetarian option, btw) and had to be sent back to be remade.  2) This is minor: Our coconut-lime green curry with chicken had rice that was dry and clumpy, which makes me suspect that it was day-old rice.  3) We placed our child's ice-cream order (along with our main dishes) at 7:30pm and by the time we were ready for dessert (before 9:00pm), they said they were out of chocolate ice-cream and only had vanilla. When we asked if we could have some chocolate syrup as a compromise, our server said OK then when the bill came, it showed up as $7.95 as opposed to the expected $2.95 for ice-cream. If we were going to be charged $5 extra for syrup, we need to be informed!!! The ice-cream did not arrive yet so we were able to refuse it and get it taken off our bill, but that took 10-15 minutes. 4) By now, we just want to get out of there. We got the corrected bill, and my husband gave the server a gift card and a credit card to cover any outstanding balance. It turns out that our gift card had enough to cover the entire meal with $4 leftover. Instead, the server swiped the gift card until the balance was down to zero and then charged our credit card another $10. Good thing we checked our gift card history and saw this. We approached the manager and he fixed it, but this was another 30 minutes of extra wait time. No apologies were given.

The service was extremely slow... the French dip was burnt to a crisp and when I mentioned it to our server... she said oh ok... didn't offer to replace it... or offer something else... then we ordered dessert... 30 minutes and still waiting for our dessert... I asked the hostess to Check on our dessert... and he goes and wipes a table... and then comes back by and says.. ""I'll find your server.... "". We're standing here to pay... she brings the melted ice cream... and says do you want this... ahhh no.... the part I don't understand is that the restaurant is not busy... are they short handed??  What gives....interesting enough as  still standing here waiting for our check... the server tried to blame the bakery for their slowness... its was not the bakery's fault... Now that I am home and had a chance to reflect on our service, I'm still frustrated and disappointed.  I think what bothers me the most... was not the burnt French dip, or the 30 plus minute wait for our dessert, or the lack of check back by our server, but how the server tried to blame the bakery for the delay in getting our desserts out... which was not the case as we watched the ice cream melt while waiting for our check at the counter... however the most frustrating part of the meal, was how the manager handled my concerns... maybe he was having a bad day.... maybe his cherries spilled... who knows... but his utmost lack of customer service was absolutely shocking... his comment to me in regards to the burnt French dip was "" well the server showed me .., and you did eat half of it..."". Well yes I did eat half of it as the server did not return to check on us.... my reply to the manager was"" YOU saw the quality of food your kitchen sent out..., and you didn't immediately to something to rectify the situation?.,,"".

The wait is a hit or miss. Most of the time, the minimum wait can be 45 minutes to an hour, but there are times where it can be less than 10 minutes! It just all depends on the time and day. This location is large and spacious, which I love. They also have a nice bar and outdoor seating area. The ladies room is clean and nicely kept. Parking is easy as there are several free parking structures nearby. Staff is friendly, but service can be severly delayed at times. My sister and I was shopping in the area and we were randomly craving some Cheesecake Factory. Luckily, we didn't have to wait long to be seated, but we did have to wait some time before our server was able to check in with us and take our orders. We shared the Crispy Crab Wontons and the Lunch BBQ Chicken Pizza with a Cesar Salad. Food was okay. It's your typical Cheesecake food, nothing spectacular other than portion sizes being generous to share with. We were so full that we ended up passing on cheesecake! Boo. Overall, not a shabby Cheesecake Factory. I do think it's better than the Stoneridge location. Prices (for all Cheesecake Factory locations) are a bit steep in comparison to the quality of the food, but again, portion sizes are generous and not to mention Cheesecake Factory has an extensive menu!

420,Rachel T.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,4,1.0,1.0,2017-08-20,"Came here as a party of 7 during the time they had the half off cheesecakes. We all decided to just get cheesecakes since most of us had eaten before. When we were seated it took 10 minutes for our server to show up and greet us. We ordered 5 cheesecakes total. The server left and didn't check up on us for the longest time, as we watched her tend to tables beside us instead. I really don't care if we just ordered cheesecakes, that doesn't give a server the right to ignore us, we're still paying customers! In fact, that was probably the easiest order she had during that time! We were very polite to her and after an hour past with no drink refills or any updates on the status of the cheesecakes, one of us had to go up to her and ask what was going on. Then she proceeded to say that the cheesecake area was backed up and would take 25-30 minutes. But she wasn't specific if it were 25-30 minutes after we initially ordered or from when one of us went up to her to ask. We waited another 30 minutes with nothing and she did not come to us to see if we were okay. She only came to our table 3 times the entire time we were there. I don't believe it was backed up as bad as she said because the table next to us when we decided to just leave had bagged up cheesecakes with them which I know they ordered after we did. Plus, if they were doing orders in a first in first out manner, that shouldn't have been a problem. It seemed like she didn't even go over to the cheesecake area to check on our order and was just hoping the employees in that area would bring it to us. I know restaurants are hectic and I understand that was a busy day for the cheesecake area in general and things can go wrong, but to get no update or apology from the staff before we even ask for info is not cool at all. The server should have known that seeing us sitting there with no cheesecakes after an hour would make her want to come up to us herself and apologize and make it right in any way she could. But instead she chose to ignore us and tend to tables by us right in front of our eyes and did not apologize until one of us had to get up and talk to her to get her attention. We felt ignored, for sure. So, to spend almost 2 hours just sitting there and having a waitress barely come to us with updates or an apology, I had a terrible experience here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=220,2.08,2.64,2.728,1.604,2.4160000000000004

They transferred me and put me on hold for 20 minutes (not an exaggeration, my phone showed I'd been on the call for 21 minutes). Thinking they might have forgotten about me, I hung up and called back. I told the guy who answered that I'd been on hold for 20 minutes and could he make sure that someone was available to take the call so I wouldn't wait another 20. He assumed a very condescending, snotty tone and said that maybe I shouldn't hang up because they're very busy over there and if I hang up they don't know I'm waiting. I was taken aback -- there was no reason for him to treat me that way. I'd been pretty patient. It's reasonable to assume after such a long wait they might have forgotten they had someone on hold. He didn't apologize or even acknowledge my wait and worse, he got attitude with me. I never did get to order my cheesecake.

Guess what, my meal was cold already when they finally brought my wife's order. I didn't mind it due to being first time here. Today, I decided to give another shot to this location. Hostess who welcomed us took us to a table which was entrance of both door that everybody gets in and out. I asked her that if it would be possible to move us to table just a table away. She replied that there is no server for that table which didn't click on me. How could every table surrounded by that table have server but this doesn't? Anyways after 10 minutes of waiting in the hall she took us to another table which was similar to first one which we refused in the beginning. At that point, I just didn't want to bother anymore and sat wherever she showed us. After 10 more minutes guess what happened?

260,Sally A.,"San Francisco, CA",0,11,5.0,1.0,2017-09-07,"I've been there at least 5-6 times. Every time it got worse. My one star is mostly based on how the food tastes.  Pros -waiters/waitresses are nice -the place is nice, and also the location is good -menu (just like all cheesecake factories) has a lot of options -cheesecakes are good Cons -everything tastes bad, literally. (except for desserts) Every thing on that menu is bad. Specifically for Walnut Creek location. They really need to start buying fresh ingredients and hire someone who can actually cook! -they don't bring their trade mark bread and butter if they don't want to, you might be sitting there watching other guest getting their bread. And when you ask for one, they don't apologize for forgetting. Makes you feel like you're asking for a favor when it's simply not a favor it's something everybody gets (except for you) -they make you wait to be seated when there are tons of available clean tables. In my opinion it's just to make it seem like people are lining up at their door, but the truth is, it's because they're being lazy, or careless. It is definitely not because the place is packed, because it's never packed, but you always have to wait to be seated. -After they take your order you wait really long time, really really long time, at least half an hour, to receive your non-edible low quality food. First of, how can you fail at guacamole? It's simply avocado and some other veggies. Even their guac was not edible. It tasted horrible. I tried all the pastas, fried bar food, appetizers, main dishes, they all tasted super bad. I rarely leave food on my plate, but at this place I can never finish because it's always tastes bad. It's either super stale, or burnt, or prepared with real bad/cheap ingredients. They overcook the meet and undercook the pasta, then burn the mushrooms, ends up being a horrible dish.  I really liked everything I tried on the menu in the SF location, but in Walnut Creek I never ever left the restaurant happy. I strongly recommend trying the SF location, although the waiting time is always at least an hour to be seated. Still at least the food is edible and it has a view.

The food quality is also good, it's getting it that's the problem. On my last two visits with a small group - 4 - there was 20-25 minute delay between the first person's entrée arriving and the last person's, such that everyone was finished by the time his food came out. They also forgot to bring out the appetizers and gave us frozen cheesecake to finish.  I get that things like this happen, it was unfortunate that it happened to us on two visits in a row, but what really was disappointing was the manager's attitude.  He came to our table he said that the particular cheesecake was a favorite and so they didn't have time to defrost it....... Then when we mentioned the delay in bringing the food out and that some people had already finished before others got their food, his responses was ""Well, what do you expect?

The last 3 times we've ordered takeout, have been a disaster of repeated frustration. We usually pick up at curbside, and after the first call of letting them know we've arrived, we wait about 20 minutes before calling a second time. We get an apology, and continue our wait. After 20 additional minutes, we call again. Only this time the hostess says she's sorry, no one notified the bakery after our first two calls. We wait another 10 minutes, and my husband decides to go inside. Food was ready. Restaurant wasn't that busy, it was Wednesday night. Our order was just sitting there at the bakery, cold food now. Later after getting home, my husband called and spoke to the manager. He was very nice, offered to send us a gift card. We redeemed the gift card a few weeks later, had a similar experience.

It was a busy saturday and we were promptly seated within about 10 minutes, which was very surprising and delightful!   Our waitress (Brittany) was pretty nice and attentive and helped us order a heaping amount of food in celebration of our completed finals! I, as usual, ordered the pasta da vinci (ALWAYS a treat) and we split the crab and artichoke dip and chicken samosa appetizers.  I'm usually a fan of the stuffed mushrooms, but I decided to spice it up and try some new ones today.  The dip was fantastic and nice and crabby.  My suggestion is to order it with lemon wedges for squirting on top of your crostinis.  The samosas weren't super amazing though.  A little dry and I wasn't too fond of the dipping sauce so they were a bit dry for me. The pasta was fantastic, as always, and went amazingly with tons and tons and tons of parmesan. Pro tip: order some extra sauce on the side with your da vinci so you can dip buttered bread in it!!!  Honestly my favorite part of the meal!

How's the food?  Fine. It's the Cheesecake Factory.  Nothing will wow you but everything will please you and you can see by the endless crowds others agree.  It's hard to recall getting the wrong order or things not being cooked properly so it's clear why they are a success wherever they go since that is hard to do so well.  The wine and beer list is long enough and reasonably priced.  It's Cheesecake- they know what they are doing.  But then there's the service.  After a year or so of decent service the older manager must have gotten promoted and things fell back into the old ways.   Ordering take out was good for a while but now the long waits on hold (if they come back) and long waits when you get there are back. When dining in there is the return of the ""not my table"" problem that leads to long waits to place an order.  And then at peak times getting your food can take a long time as well.  Things get worse if your server takes a break midway through service.  At this point this is what we expect and just bake it in to our expectations.  Everyone is very nice so you will never have rude service - that's why they are still A-OK- and why things will probably never improve.  What's the incentive?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=20,3.12,2.41,2.672,,2.6940000000000004

209,David F.,"Concord, CA",53,375,1603.0,4.0,2018-01-02,"The Cheesecake Factory in Walnut Creek is like a little bit of Las Vegas in your home town: gorgeous and glitzy in an over-the-top but attractive way. This is often our destination for special occasions as everyone can find something to eat on their massive menu.  Then you can top it all off with an amazing variety of the best cheesecake you'll ever eat. However, if you are watching your calories, Cheesecake Factory is a challenge! To their credit, they have a ""Skinnylicious"" menu with entrées of 590 calories or less. Unfortunately, the couple times I had tried items from this menu in the past they had been less than inspiring. But on my last visit I found something good: the Skinny Chicken Pot Pie was actually very tasty! It looks a little different from what you might expect as it comes in a soup bowl with a puff pastry floating on the top. But looks are deceiving, and it tasted delicious. If you want cheesecake you pretty much have to accept it's not going to be a great calorie day. The cheesecakes average about 1200 calories, ranging from the Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake at 1540 calories to the Low-Carb Cheesecake at 620. The Pumpkin Cheesecake at about 900 was my compromise and quite good. You can also get cheesecakes to-go even if you aren't dining in. Just inside the entrance on the left is a ""cheesecake bar"" where you can order cheesecakes to go, quick and easy. We have done this on several occasions. One minus is that Cheesecake Factory does not take reservations, and the wait can be long at busy times.
