181,Anna S.,"Washington, DC",201,267,24.0,3.0,2012-01-09,"I have a friend who uses ""Cheesecake Factory"" as a put-down for boring suburban people: ""She said her favorite place to shop is Ann Taylor LOFT. Cheesecake Factory."" ""Cheesecake Factory took me to Macaroni Grill for a date and spent the entire time 'talking politics' with nonstop Jon Stewart quotes.""  1. Hilarious. 2. This perfectly encapsulates for me why Cheesecake Factory has almost become cool again in recent years. The original big box restaurant for surburban bores, the seminal font of ginormous portions and impossibly long menus, the promised land for fourth-graders all over the country: It's now almost self-parodying, and therefore it's a lot more fun to visit than any of the competitors it's spawned. My high school friends and I - who visited this location once or twice a month between 2000 and 2003 - recently reunited here for dinner. My eggplant sandwich was the size of my head. Pasta wasn't served on plates so much as wallowed into tureens. Our waiter - who seemed, like every Cheesecake waiter I can remember, to be an aspiring actor - could not take an order or pick up a plate without saying ""TEN-FOUR!"" or ""EIGHTY-SIXED!"" in a voice so full of zazzy enthusiasm that I had no trouble imagining he went home to an apartment full of mutilated hobo corpses. The entrees, while caloric, were tasty. Prices were reasonable, considering that the leftovers were going to feed us for days. Drinks were so generously poured that I was stumbling after two wines.  The real letdown was the cookie dough cheesecake, which came on a crust that tasted like crumbled cardboard and featured far less cookie dough than I remembered. I was sad to see that the peanut butter chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake had disappeared from the menu - that thing took excess to new levels. I miss high school. Cheesecake Factory hasn't changed since high school. Therefore, I like Cheesecake Factory now more than I ever did.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-washington?start=180,3.44,3.44,3.44,2.7640000000000002,3.4400000000000004

I play it safe and stick with the buffalo blasts (fried egg rolls stuffed with lotsa shredded chicken tossed in buffalo sauce). They're hot, crisp and always good.

Neither our drinks or our appetizers arrived together, what gives?  The server brings my son a refill of his soda and he sets it down very hard on the table.  My husband's appetizer finally arrives. We are finishing our appetizers, when the server comes back to ""confirm"" our entree order.  He basically takes our order again and informs us that the steaks will take about 25 minutes to cook.  Why was that neccesary to tell us how long it would take to cook our food?  I have never had a server tell me that before.  Our entrees arrive about 30 minutes later.  A table seated about 10 minutes after we arrived have already received their entrees.  Our entress are okay.  Nothing all that special.  This is not characteristic of my experience of The Cheesecake Factory. Specifically, my shrimp scampi was dry, there was very little sauce on the plate and the garlic cloves which are usualy plentiful are few and far between.  As our dinner draws to a close, our server begins to become very gregarious and helpful.  When we ask for boxes, he responds, ""my pleasure.""  He offers to validate my parking ticket and hands it back to me with a ""my pleasure.""  Obviously, this is his push for a great tip.  Our bill is $117.  I leave a $5 tip.  I ask to speak to the manager to explain the low tip.  He listens and apologizes for our experience.  it will be a very long time before I see the inside of this chain restaurant again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-washington?start=240,2.92,3.31,3.31,3.0480000000000005,3.154

As a job the place was pretty cool I would make between $100-150 after their CRAZY ASS TIP OUT SYSTEM (Bartender+Buser+Food runner). I have been back several times since, so that should tell you The food is great. I tried almost everything on the 200+ menu in my year of working there. Some of my favs. were Avocado Egg rolls and Firecracker rolls, Miso Salmon, Chinese Chicken Salad, Tempura rolls...basically I can go on and on. The portion sizes are great for the prices and as a Big girl I always pride myself on being able to stretch a plate for two meals. As far as all the complaints of the portions being too large alot of time there is a lunch and dinner size and also let's remember YOU DON'T HAVE TO EAT IT ALL. Portion what you will eat first then TO-GO the rest. simple as that. Last but not least, my favorite Cheesecake hands down was...(drumroll)...and still is....Fresh Banana Cream.

Their cashew chicken is OK. Burgers are solid. Flatbread sandwich is decent, even if it pales in comparison to what you might have in Navajo country.  Lots of choices for appetizers too... most of them good. My favorite are the sliders - some of the best I've had. The lettuce wraps are good. The calamari is OK.

About another 20 minutes passes and my meal is once again brought out; however, this time the chicken was undercooked. Again, the waiter apologized and took the plate. The manager came back out and explained to me that the chicken is marinated over night and was cooked at 185 degrees and how it was in fact all the way done. I, however, still have to disagree. Maybe the piece that I tried didn't cook all the way. By this time i had been in the restaurant for over an hour so I just decided to get cheesecake to go.

I think this is a very standard American eating experience with some attempts to go ethnic.  Stick to some kind of theme though is my advice and shorten the menu.  Too many items make it impossible to do any one dish really well and increase wait time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-washington?start=180,3.56,3.38,3.38,2.2800000000000002,3.4520000000000004

If only they took reservations...Regardless. the food was decent and the staff was friendly, so in the end, I gave it 4 stars. FOOD = 4.5 stars I ordered Evelyn's Favorite Pasta, which tasted well enough, but I should've gone with my first choice, Four Cheese pasta. If I was gonna order carbs anyway, might as well go out. But no, I tried to be healthy and avoid the cheese and totally regretted it. My friend sitting across from me ended up ordeirng the Four Cheese pasta and it was mocking me the entire night. Portion size is defintely huge. I couldn't finish my pasta in one sitting and had to bring it home. I'm personally not a huge fan of cheesecake, but all of my friends raved about the chocolate & peanut butter cheesecake so I'll just go out on a limb and assume it was good. SERVICE = 3.5 stars One word: SLOW. If it weren't for the fact that we were an hour and a half away from campus, I wouldn't wait 2 hours for my food. The wait was long, and after a day of shopping, we were all starving. For dinner, I recommend coming early around 5pm or later around 8pm. Definitely avoid the dinner rush between 6-7pm. Food was served around 20 minutes after we ordered, but our waiter was clearly preoccupied with other tables. We had to try really hard to get his attention when we wanted more water, order cheesecake for dessert, and pay the check. PRICE = 4 stars A little pricey bc we were in DC but still worth it, given the amount of food they give. Evelyn's Favorite Pasta was around $14-15.

This is probably why you're here. It's delicious. Cons: - The environment. It doesn't have any sound-dampening features, so you can hear the conversations going on right next to you and the whole place is very loud. Not ideal for a date. Also, the tables are a little too close together for my taste. - Food portions are entirely too large. Pastas could feed an entire household per order, and the burgers are borderline inedible they're so big. Even their Skinnylicious menu portions are huge! I'd rather they slightly reduce their portion sizes and also reduce their prices accordingly - Servers, while very nice, aren't the most attentive.

They flew all the way from Europe to see me and I took them to Cheesecake Factory because I thought it'd be nice, but the evening was just more trouble than it was worth.  My dad ordered a beer and the glass was broken, so he accidentally cut his mouth on it.  We're not high maintenance patrons; we just asked that the waitress take it away and probably throw away the glass so nobody else has that experience.  The waitress was appropriately apologetic about it, but the manager came over.  I thought she was going to apologize or offer us a free beer or a coupon or something to compensate for the bad experience.  But instead she overbearingly asked us, ""Is there a problem??"" And we simply explained the situation- not that we should have had to.  We really just wanted to be left alone so we could eat our food.  They brought my dad another beer, but accidentally charged us for three beers.  Not only did it take us fifteen minutes to convince the waitress that my dad was only brought two, (although he did technically only drink one because the first one cut his lip) but it would have been more impressive if they had said ""You know what? The beer's on us.""  I was just all around very disappointed.   once I went there just to get avocado egg rolls to go, and there were more sun dried tomatoes than avocados, so the egg rolls were tart and overwhelming.  They're overpriced, but they're so good I normally don't mind.  Now I'm hesitant to splurge on them again. The food is great, but I mean, it's a chain so I can't really credit this place with that. Overall it's just a sloppy establishment. The music is too loud and the service is unprofessional.

A lot of bars and restaurants have 3-5 dishes on their happy hour menu and a similar number of drinks.  Cheesecake Factory offers at least two pages of delicious options for every palate. From crab rangoons and cheeseburger sliders, to Vietnamese shrimp egg rolls and tamale cakes smothered in salsa verde, this is the place to come if you want to do more than just drink the day away. And the prices are GREAT, especially for this part of town. Most of the happy hour dishes are $5-$7, and the drink specials offered are usually about the same (depending in what you order, of course). According to one of the bartenders, the restaurant has an arrangement with the Beringer vineyards, which makes a Merlot exclusively for the Cheesecake Factory. It's one of my favorite wines at any restaurant; juicy and just slighty sweet. I could easily drink that stuff by the bottle.  And it goes without saying that the cheesecake is amazing. That's a given. There are very few things in life that a slice of chocolate chip cookie dough or red velvet cheesecake cannot fix. Period. The only reason that this isn't a 5 star experience is because the staff is iffy.

62,Linda O.,"Washington, DC",146,207,55.0,3.0,2015-03-06,"They have an infinite number of offerings--a regular menu, a skinny menu, a cheesecake menu and a booze menu. Talk about choices; it's almost mind-bending. I have had some good experiences here. And not so. Kids like it; the name lures them (and parents) in. I've caved to the pressure of teenagers plotting to go here. The salads are reasonable; quinoa & kale salad and ceasar salad are go-tos for me. A few appetizers aren't bad; crispy crab bites and hot artichoke dip are safe. It's the main entrees that I find myself objecting to. Last time I ordered the southern fried catfish platter; the catfish was decent, but canned corn as a side? Are you kidding me? For the price I was paying? The green beans were as tough as clothes pins, too. The cheesecake is agreeable, nothing phenomenal. The bread that accompanies the meal is so so, although freely offered. The restaurant itself feels cold to me no matter what season. All that tile and stone--on the floor, tabletops, bar, staircases--invites the chill factor. Service is usually satisfactory. When this Cheesecake Factory first opened in DC a few years back, it was all the rage.   The food is generally acceptable.

We ordered a 10 inches ""The Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake"" over the phone to be picked up by April 13th which is today. When we came it was already almost 7pm, so we have decided to have dinner since we haven't eaten yet. We told the server we ordered a whole cheesecake over the phone and asked her if she's going to give it to us before we leave, she said yes! she is going to give it to us before we leave. An hour later, when we were about to leave she told us that it's better to pick the cheesecake up ourselves from the bakery so we can see the cheesecake and etc. then we said, ok no big deal. So we went to the bakery and asked for the cheesecake we ordered over the phone. As soon as we got home, I took the box out of the bag and saw the exterior side of the box has lots of chocolate stain probably the person who put the cake in the box has DIRTY HANDS and didn't even wipe the box at least!!!!!

148,AccioSoyMilk ..,"Richland, MS",20,64,,3.0,2015-05-29,"I had a job interview in the area and decided to visit. I've only been to the Cheesecake Factory once in my life, and as this one (which was not the same I one I had visited previously) close to the Metro (right across the street), I zeroed in on this place to eat. The restaurant seems a little small and cramped when you enter, but then again I didn't go upstairs, so maybe it was spacious. The hostess offered to seat me in a small seat that is right in view of anyone who walks in. At first I was going to be like, ""Fine,"" but I saw that they had more (better!) seating inside.  I was actually right next to the kitchen entrance, but I was okay with that because that meant there was no one to the right of me and it meant my food would come out all that much faster. :P My server was fantastic. I'm not 100% of her name, but she was super friendly, always with a smile while not being uber creepy that some servers are. If she was having a bad day or just wanted the Friday to end, I definitely couldn't tell. I could also see she provided the same service and courtesy to my neighboring diners, including noting any special requests if made. After perusing the menu for a few minutes, I was brought water and I made my order. I got a chicken almond salad sandwich and a green salad and a green iced tea. I was hungrrrrryyyyy. But the iced tea came out in good time and the main course was reasonable by most standards (maybe not by my tummy, but whatever). I'm actually confused. I got a bowl of soup even though I thought that was an entirely separate item. It was tasty, a cheese and vegetable chicken soup. The salad had too much dressing (should have requested it on the side) so that the leaves on the bottom were soggy. It was good, but it was too much. The sandwich itself was a little disappointing: it was like they had cut out the middle of bread and called it a serving. I swear the pieces were perhaps the width of two of my fingers, and I have small hands! It tasted good, but it was kind of a pathetic serving. But for the most part everything tasted good. I ate, but as I said, stuff like the salad had too much dressing. I finished and spent a few minutes reading when my server came back to take away my plate. I requested their Godiva brownie sundae, no whipped cream. She repeated my order and said it's coming right up. I did enjoy the brownie sundae, but it was a little too much. Too much brownie that was very rich, and not enough ice cream to balance out. I made it about 2/3 of the way through but couldn't finish. It'd be a great dessert to share, but I wasn't expecting the brownie to be so rich. Ugh, I could feel my clothes expanding from the fat, right then and there. :) As I ate, I got my check. It was expensive. Everything was about $25, not including tip. I'm still not sure what happened with my salad/sandwich thing and wonder if there was a miscommunication somewhere. But it was nice to visit. I probably wouldn't come here on my own again for awhile since it's just a little too much, but it was fun to see what this location was like and the service was really good (except for the seating in the beginning, perhaps).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-washington?start=140,3.0,3.09,3.09,2.252,3.054

By far the biggest menu I have ever scene with many yummy options from artery cloggers to healthy options and beyond. The desserts and especially the cheesecakes are of course amazing. Whatever you are in the mood for the Cheesecake factory will have it!! The secret to success at the Cheesecake factory is that they are constantly food testing. What is food testing you ask? Here is some inside skinny, the managers constantly send out ""fake"" food orders to test the quality throughout the day. If anything is off they address it immediately. That is why the quality and taste of the food is so consistent. As far as corporate restaurants go, this is well oiled machine.

We got situated, she came back with menus & told us that Mike would be serving us. That he did, what outstanding serving & social skills he exuded.  He was very pleasant, engaging & knew the menu.  Mike also was proactive & stay on accord in checking on us through out. After we demolished the yummy Avocado Egg Rolls, we did decided to try one of their new salads, the Vegan Cobb Salad, say it an't so CF.

Pasta with the rigatoni, which is vegan, tossed in olive oil instead of butter & 86 the parmesan cheese, you are golden to enjoy some good options.  Salads galore...of course.

28,Mell H.,"Olney, MD",159,65,71.0,2.0,2016-01-28,"I'm a huge fan of the Cheesecake factory-- in fact, it's one of my family's usual go-to places after we do some shopping at Westfield Montgomery mall in Rockville. My mom, sister and I decided to eat at the Friendship Heights location after doing some shopping around the area but we were sorely disappointed. The food and service was noticeably shabbier than the Rockville branch. We ordered the Thai veggie wraps, crispy fish tacos, a fried mac and cheese burger, and the lemon meringue cheesecake. Our server was quick to take our orders but she brought out our food very late which was my biggest complaint for today's dinner. A couple sitting across the room from us arrived later than my trio, ordered after us, and still got their food a good 15 minutes before us even though they had ordered very similar items (burger and tacos) The burger and Thai lettuce wraps were excellent! The lettuce wraps in particular are so fresh, delicious, and flavorful! My family always gets them when we come to Cheesecake, especially because everything else we order tends to be fried and heavy haha. You won't be dissapointed with the quality of the vegetables or size of the dish.  The biggest let down of the evening and the reason for my 2 star review was the fish tacos. The fish itself was crispy and tasteful, but the rice, which is great at the Rockville location, was dry, tasteless, and stale. The two lime wedges that came with the tacos were dry to the point that they were hard to the touch (i couldn't even squeeze the juice out of them). The marinated onions had soaked the bottom of the tortilla and caused it to mush up. It all became clear to me then: the tacos had been left underneath the heating lamp for way too long. I don't know what happened in the kitchen or with our waitress, but the tacos had been ruined due to neglect. I could have forgiven the bad rice if it was simply bad rice, but could I overlook an amalgamate of crusty rice, crusty limes, soggy tacos, caused by our overly long wait for food? No way. Anyways, I don't think my review is reflective of the branch as a while. The food overall is better at the Rockville branch, but tonight's major issue regarding the lackluster fish tacos could have been avoided entirely if the food had reached us in a timely manner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-washington?start=40,2.56,2.86,2.86,2.408,2.74

I've come to this location several times in the past and have always had a great time. Unfortunately, this past weekend, I cannot say the same. My friend and I decided amongst ourselves that our server had to have been brand new - that's the only way we could remain patient and polite with such disappointing service. I had to ask twice for sweetener for my iced tea. We had to ask for bread to be brought out. The bread finally came, but the server seemed to not think that silverware or plates were necessary. Had to ask for those. I ordered the brown-butter roasted carrots with pecans as one of my side dishes. It came out of the kitchen as just a plate of warm carrots. I asked the server where the butter and pecans were and she said ""I didn't know it was supposed to come with pecans."" I'm guessing she missed menu training?! I know from my own history as a server that it's a really nice touch to include a container of whatever sauce came on the plate with people's leftovers when they're packed to go. I can't say that I was surprised that she didn't pack me a container of the delicious remoulade that accompanied my fried catfish, but as I am eating these plain leftovers, I really wish she'd thought to do that.  In addition to my own poor service, there was another server working the patio alongside my server this particular night. I was sitting two tables away as I heard him complaining to a table about a table that had just left and how did they didn't tip. He gave a monologue about the frustrations of ""paying to be here"" because he had to tip out the bar and the bussers and whoever else and it really just upsets him when people ""don't tip for no reason."" If I wasn't already distracted by the fact that he was wearing shorts, which is generally unacceptable at any place above a bar, I was definitely distracted by him speaking that way.

Can we get a better table please?! Hostess seemed offended that she had asked. Moving on, waiter took his time in getting to us. It wasnt that busy. (9pm) I wanted crab  wontons and apple crisp and my friend got a salad. Food came out fast. My crab wontons barely tasted like crab. It was more like eating deep fried cream cheese balls. The dipping sauce was horrific. Menu stated: sweet chili sauce that was a lie. I got some rice vinegar dressing with red pepper flakes swimming in it. I couldnt eat it. So, my waiter pulled a disappearing act. Never checked on us. My friends salad, she liked it.

We were seated for about fifteen minutes before having to flag down two severs for the bread. One of the nice things about going to The Cheesecake Factory is eating bread while browsing the menu. While ordering I asked for certain items to be left off, I was informed that the sever isn't able to accommodate the request due to the system. We typically come once or twice a month and I always get the same time... with the accommodations. I'm pretty sure the sever just didn't want to put in the extra work. We finally got the bread and our food (without the accommodations) came right after. The table across from us sent their bill back three times and the sever still couldn't seem to figure it out. I'm not exactly sure where our sever went during the course of the meal. I asked for ranch and by the time the sever came back I didn't need it anymore. The sever even mentioned that it had taken him ten minutes. Eventually we got our bill and everything was surprising correct. However; the bill was rung up wrong and when we tried to use a gift card we got the balance slip but no giftcard. It took another ten minutes for him to come back with it. I honestly felt like we spent more time correcting issues and looking for our sever than we spent enjoying our meal. We won't be back to this exact location. It's unfortunate that The Cheesecake Factory cannot seem to offer quality service at all of their restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-washington?start=20,2.92,2.72,3.0,2.3760000000000003,2.8000000000000003

15,Linda L.,"Rockville, MD",79,185,308.0,3.0,2017-07-04,"The restaurant is located in downtown Chevy Chase. There is street parking nearby or garage parking for a fee. Outdoor and indoor seating are available, and this location occupies two floors. On this day, we arrived right when they opened at 11:30am and were able to snag seats indoors close to the window which provided a great view of the streets. The tables are arranged close to one another, so that is one thing to consider if you prefer more privacy. I ordered an egg white omelette with veggies and goat cheese. For the custom omelette, you can add up to four toppings and it comes with toast and tomatoes/house potatoes. The portions here are very generous, so make room for dessert! The menu is endless with breakfast served all day and a separate Sunday brunch and of course, cheesecake menu. My omelette came out perfectly constructed; however, the goat cheese was not spread throughout. The house potatoes were somewhat bland since there was not enough seasoning.  Our waitress, Jordan checked on us several times and the service was good.

It's been like 2 years since we went to a Cheesecake Factory but it was worth it for the strong drinks and great food deals for happy hour! Wesley served us and he was just awesome. He was really attentive, made sure we got our drinks before happy hour ended, and was overall really pleasant. After having a pretty crummy day, he was a joy to have! The food was good, too. The happy hour burger was actually the size of a real burger and it was no hassle to get fries on the side. I didn't care for the rice with my steak tacos, but the tacos themselves were pretty tasty.

The Chicken Da Vinci is disgusting and our server claimed that he knew it was horrible and asked me why I ordered it. Now, this is after 30 minutes of NOT checking on us and the table next to us. The table next to us sent their food back as well.  I do NOT reccomend celebrating anything here. The cheesecake is yummy but that's most likely not made in house. Oh and, no I didnt get a free one.

Sometimes that turns out well, and sometimes not.   We both enjoyed the warm Apple Crisp with vanilla ice cream.   The staff was very friendly - we were greeted warmly at the door, and our server was friendly and knowledgeable and efficient.   The restaurant is loud - on each of the two levels.  At this location they have outdoors seating off the lower level, which is a nice option.   They don't take reservations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-washington?start=20,3.24,2.72,2.992,,2.9280000000000004

The chicken samosas were essentially ground chicken in triangles - no potatoes or veggies that a traditional samosa has. They were greasy and I would not get again. We also ordered an entree off of the regular menu and just a note - the complimentary bread was not good. The bread wasn't quite room temperature, but practically. Our refill batch (we like our carbs), was cold and stale - but maybe that's what we get for asking for a refill. No qualms about service; it was adequate.
