159,Gina B.,"Milwaukee, WI",77,358,147.0,3.0,2012-01-17,"I have been to the Cheescake Factory twice now and this review is a blend of both experiences.  First time - horrible experience.  Long wait time, about 40 minutes longer than quoted and the food was a sloppy mess.  After spending $30 for two burgers for lunch, I vowed I would never return. More recent experience - still long wait time and the hostess really doesn't know the meaning of 25 minutes when it is more like an hour that you wait.  The menu is huge, just absolutely huge.  It's like reading a book.  Many selections.  The prices are still ridiculous but I have to say that I loved what I had this time and thought it was a really good value for the money.  Chicken Di Pana is very good.  I was surprised when they brought my plate out and it looked like it was a dinner for two. Our waitress was super friendly and the service was great, couldn't ask for better. My friend treated me and my son because she had some gift cards and even with $50 worth, I paid another $25 toward the bill - this was for Lunch!  So yes, the prices are on the high end. Always packed, long waits, high prices, good quality (at least what I had) and HUGE portions.   The cheesecake..... ehh, wasn't a big fan.  Ironic hey!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wauwatosa-2?start=100,3.308,3.308,3.308,3.308,3.308
157,Lacey B.,"Milwaukee, WI",43,70,,4.0,2012-02-10,"If you can't find something you like from a menu this big, then perhaps eating isn't for you. Observations: -The portions are huge and the prices reflect such. -This location (at Mayfair) is always busy. As are every Cheesecake Factory location. -The complimentary bread is delish. -When you are finally seated, you may end up at one of the table in the long ""row."" Dining this way is not private, intimate, romantic, etc. I wish ALL restaurants would do away with this interior design choice. NO customers like it. -I have never ordered a meal that I didn't like. Although, several times my entree has come out of the kitchen miss-prepared and needed to be sent back. I blame individual servers and/or kitchen staff, and not the restaurant chain as a whole. -Don't go to the Cheesecake Factory if you're dieting.

A few empty tables, so we beat the rush.  Server showed up within a minute & took our cocktail order.  We were nit-picky on the order but, very soon thereafter, received our cocktails exactly as requested.  (Ten points for the server!) We ordered the combination ""Steak Diane""/salmon dinner, the sweet corn tamale cakes and the ""crispy artichoke.""  Steak was cooked medium rare as ordered; great flavor and very tender.  The sweet corn tamales were outstanding.... served with an in-house salsa of tomato, avocado,etc.... not sure, but SO good.  I was equivocal about getting the artichoke dish, but it was outstanding and a very unique dish that I will definitely order as an appetizer next time I'm here.

I think they have the best cheesecake I have ever had.  I also enjoyed the appetizers/starters.  The first time I went, for my main course I got a caesar salad without the chicken. The portion size was huge! I only finished 1/4 of it, and I wasn't so happy with it.  The second time, for my main course I got a grilled cheese with cheddar cheese. I didn't like it very much. I don't recommend getting a grilled cheese with cheddar. A different cheese most likely would have been good. It was also a very large sandwich.  I think this place is very good.

I explained that I was on hold for about 10 minutes just to order curbside to go. I was told that there were 2 people in the bakery and that the person who answered the phone would go let the 2 people in the bakery know that my phone call would be transferred.

75,Zach O.,"Milwaukee, WI",65,199,15.0,4.0,2013-01-02,"As legendary connoisseurs of American style decadence, I'm sure you are all aware that The Cheesecake Factory is one of the worst restaurants for you.  The quality of the food is all right, but there's nothing amazing on the menu and the prices are unusually high for the average quality of the food.  While the interior is extremely nice, if you've seen one Cheesecake Factory you've seen them all. The bar area is always extremely nice with plenty of seating, the floor has a ton of room and a lot of tables feel relatively private, but a lot of the booth style seating can sometimes put you uncomfortably close to strangers.  The main reason I'm here is the RED VELVET CHEESECAKE. This cheesecake is so perfect I've been sitting here for 10 minutes trying to find the words to describe it...there are none.  There is no price too high or service too poor to make this cheesecake not worth the trip to the Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wauwatosa-2?start=60,3.4,3.4,3.4,3.088,3.4000000000000004
156,Amanda L.,"Pasadena, CA",99,56,21.0,3.0,2013-01-16,"I mean...it's Cheesecake Factory....if you've been to one, you've basically been to all of them.  The menu is massive and cluttered with ads, it's pretty inside, they have a lot of cheesecake...blah blah blah. You all know this. I'm writing this, though, because I've been to this location twice in the past week while visiting family ...and let's be honest, there are not too many places to have a nice dinner around these parts. So I figure...why not? Our first experience: It was Sunday night and the restaurant was dead....as dead as anything that has ever died. We were sat in a little corner and a few times I felt like we were forgotten about.  We ordered the Boston House Salad and the Chicken Parmesan Sandwich. We decided we'd just share both items...and thank goodness we did...HUGE portions. The salad was very good and the sandwich was awesome. Only thing I didn't like was the roasted peppers...they kind of over powered the entire thing.  The bread was pretty cold and hard too :/ Second visit: We came with another couple and it was a little bit busier this time. We were still seated right away and our waitress was very sweet...although very spacey. She took a long time to bring anything at all. We had to ask for the bread and for refills multiple times.  My boyfriend and I ordered the same combo...and it was MUCH better this time. We also ordered the sandwich without the peppers so that was a huge plus. The cheese on the sandwich was more melty and delicious and overall...just a better meal.  The other couple ordered the Salisbury Steak (yeah, I dunno why that was ordered either...huge joke of the night haha) and the Shrimp Pasta. Both of them were very happy with their choices.  The bread was also much better this time around. I'll assume this is because it was busier...but still...make the effort to serve fresh food to all of the guests. My big complaint from this night was the fact that our waitress took so long to come pick up my credit card, we had to flag down another employee to take care of it. It was seriously about 15 minutes!!  So...all things considered...3 stars. I do like the fact that even though this location is at a mall...it's detached from the mall. Makes it feel a bit nicer than most other locations. RECOMMENDATION!! Try the Mint Green Iced Tea (Sweetened)....SO GOOD.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wauwatosa-2?start=100,3.44,3.44,3.44,2.9560000000000004,3.4400000000000004

It IS a little pricey here, and the food is probably only a step up from olive garden, but I still like it here. The menu has everything under the sun and then some.  Our service the other night was really really really good.  We split a piece of cheesecake and when we asked for the bill to be split, our waitress split the price of the cheesecake 3 ways. Nice!  Our only suggestion? A cheesecake sampler please and thank you! So difficult to decide on one kind with like 40 flavors!

Tonight for example we arrived at 8:30PM to a restaurant that was about half full. The hostess could have gave us any of the half open table and booths. In my experience most people would prefer to sit by a window in a booth, she choose to seat us and one of there small tables in the far back as close as you can get to the kitchen.  In most places this would have not been an issue but CF is already one of the loudest restaurants too begin with, with its high vaulted ceilings the noises just travel.

The tamales were truly so-so, no kick to the sauce. It was the ""gumbo"" that was truly mediocre. Chicken - way overcooked; shrimp - overcooked, small... And not many. The ""spicy Cajun"" sauce was neither, and it was packed with tomatos (?!) It was more of a jambalaya, but not a great one.

Cheesecake is one of my favorite desserts, so it comes as no surprise that this chain is one of my favorites. I really like the design of this one. It has high ceilings and a welcoming decor. The staff was really nice. Our waiter was really friendly and made great small talk- he noticed my girlfriend's Batman shirt and they excitedly talked about upcoming movies and TV shows. It's a little pricey, but the portions are massive. If you eat like I do, you pretty much get two meals- one portion that you finish at the restaurant and another that you get to enjoy later at home. The menu is so long, but it offers something for everyone. From Chinese food to burgers, to pasta, and everything in between. They also have the best free bread at the start of the meal- seriously, the honey wheat brown bread is one of the reasons to go.  I went with my girlfriend and her mother. My girlfriend ordered the Factory combination, with Steak Diane and Herb Crusted Salmon with mashed potatoes. She was really happy with everything on her plate. Her mother and I both had Chicken Madeira, and it was amazing. The sauce is the perfect amount of sweetness, and the portion is massive. Her mom loved it too, it was her first time having it and she was really pleased. Naturally, we had to get dessert. Mother got the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake. It's layers of cheesecake, fudge cake, and truffle cream. It looked outrageously decadent, and she said it was a good life choice.

Their menu is huge; it's a bit overwhelming, but it does offer something for everybody. We've been going to Cheesecake for years, and I've sampled something from every part of that menu. Their skinny menu is delicious, salads and sandwiches are always good, their (limited) mexican-ish options are tasty (I love the chicken tacos), and their pasta is always tasty. My boyfriend has tried just about every meat option, and his only complaint was with the filet mignon (it was fatty), and I told him to only order that cut of meat at an actual steak place (he didn't listen). My only complaint is their burgers - they aren't necessarily bad, I know a lot of people enjoy them, but I do not care for them at all. The cheesecakes are always delicious - my favorite is the apple strudel cheesecake! The s'mores cheesecake is also so so tasty. Seriously - even if you're stuffed, which you probably will be because their portions are huge - either get some cheesecake to go, or split a piece with your table. Just don't go to Cheesecake Factory without getting cheesecake!  We've never had bad service here. Sometimes service may be slow, but that has never bothered us. As long as our food gets to us fresh and hot, we are happy. I highly recommend going either before the dinner rush (like 3-4 pm), or after dinner (like 9 pm). If you go during a meal time on the weekend, there's a good chance you'll do some waiting.

I told her that I wasn't yelling, just said it louder because she could not hear me. Well, then began her attitude. She returned with the lemon on a stick and plopped it in my water and walked away. We waited for a ridiculous amount of time to order dessert.

88,Jessie H.,"Menomonee Falls, WI",59,1,,1.0,2016-10-28,"Worst experience at this restaurant I have ever had. I will never go back. My boyfriend took me here for dinner. I've been to plenty of different locations and always had a nice time and good food but this was the worst experience I have ever had at any restaurants. First they sat us at a back 2 person table that I couldn't even get into without bumping other people. The waitress couldn't even hand us our bread because there was no room. We finally order and I get the shrimp and tomato pasta with basil etc. There was only a half serving of pasta, peas in my meal, and the shrimp was so over cooked I couldn't even bite it- the tails were black. And for 23.00 I got a lousy 5 shrimp. By the time the waitress returned my boyfriend had finished his meal and I had picked at mine enough to wear I just wanted to leave. I explained my displeasure and the waitress said she would get the manager. 15 minutes later the manager appears asking me if I wanted new shrimp and when I said no she just walked away. Meanwhile all this was going on the double date of two middle aged couples in the booth behind us had their phone lights on looking at their menus flashing in the eyes every few seconds enough for me and my boyfriend to say something to them twice and the waitress.  The waitress felt bad and gave us our cheesecake for free regardless of what her manager said and our meal will still 65.00.  The little things like our waitress never filling our water glass, or asking for a refill of drinks. Or not once checking on us till our dinner was over did not even compare to the other issues.  If you want a nice dinner. I beg you, don't go here. Spend your money someplace where it will matter and the staff cares.

136,Suzanne H.,"Waukesha, WI",0,3,2.0,3.0,2016-10-28,"Went for the first time on Thurs. night as party of 5 to celebrate a birthday. No reservation was accepted, but a not too bad 15 min. wait for table dispite the fact it was busy. Unfortunatly the service was S L O W. It took a very long time to recieve our drinks (server told us a couple bartenders had called in sick or something) Cosmo was very sour. Appitizers were good...crab artichoke dip and a mexican egg roll dish. My food order was totally mixed up however. I ordered the combo dinner, steak diane and herb crusted salmon which comes served with mashed potatoes. I asked if a vegetable was included and the server said he was pretty sure broccoli came with it. Cool. After a bit he returned to say he was told by the kitchen that ""no, veggies are not included.""  I said ok then i would like the side of glazed carrots with it..which on the menu description said glazed carrots with pecans. When food came, my dish had no potatoes, carrots in a brown sugar butter sauce (no pecans) and no herb crusted salmon, just plain salmon with ALOT of lemon on it. Unfortunately I am one of those who do not care for lemon on any fish. Later...much later when we finally saw our server again, he said he 'subbed' carrots for potatoes and he would go ahead and order a side of carrots again, this time with the pecans on it ( like the menu says) but he would have to charge extra for the side of carrots. Well I expected to be charged for the side from the beginning! I never said I didnt want my potatoes or the word 'sub' anything! And, i didn't even bring up the uncrusted, lemony salmon. Just an overall disappointment on my dish. Others seemed to enjoy the pasta dishes they ordered, however, after ordering another round of drinks, it took a half hour to get those (yes we had finished eating for the most part by the time they arrived), it ruined the experience. 3 cheesecake slices between the 5 of us and $235 bill plus (not well deserved) tip. :( ouch. I know our server was probebly busy, i've been there, but a smile and even a brief bit of intrest would have been welcomed.

My recent Monday lunch (1ish) visit found my group of 4 having to wait 10 minutes for an open table.  We of course were seated in the bank of tables where others are within 18"" on both sides. Cheesecake Factory would be so much better served rearranging the seating format to really focus on the experience of the visit.  It really is an interesting theme and looking around at the interior architecture is part of the experience.  I have always been a fan of the classic burger and never been dissapointed until this visit. I ordered my meal medium & I'm fairly certain the meat was still mooing.  That's on me for not complaining but I hate doing so because there's always that fear of what's happening to the food when sent back. Two of our group received their meals a full five minutes before the other two.  The waitress even came to ask how we were enjoying the first few bites to correcting her question to how half of our group was enjoying their first bites.  We were not offered drink refills at any point during our meal The cheesecake as always was excellent.  Seems Cheesecake Factory is getting a little complacent in preparation & service.  We will return because the Mall is right there & the cheesecake remains awesome but it's time to reboot their game a bit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wauwatosa-2,3.04,3.31,3.31,2.636,3.202

48,Janelle C.,"Greendale, WI",0,6,14.0,4.0,2017-09-28,"Consistently great-tasting food! Everything is a little bit overpriced but servings are fairly large. I recommend the bacon bacon burger - what a treat when I really want to splurge on calories! Their fries are also cooked to a crispy gold perfection. My mom is a picky eater and she actually quite enjoys the grilled fish tacos! They provide complimentary bread and butter, and would recommend just asking for the wheat bread because it's soft and delicious, while the white bread can be crusty. Service has also been consistently good at this location! Side note: their menu is quite large and can be overwhelming.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wauwatosa-2,2.96,3.22,3.22,,3.1160000000000005
53,Jessie P.,"Franklin, WI",0,29,2.0,1.0,2017-10-03,Very poor service.  Horrible bartenders and service at the bar. I know would see that the food is good the most people go out for the atmosphere and I would have to say this is what are the pores atmospheres that I have seen in a very long time. If I wanted to hear people whine and cry I would have just stayed home. We go out to escape have an experience this was a horrifying experience. Pretty sure the cheesecake factory has lost my business this was the 2nd time I have gone back hoping things would get better but it has not.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wauwatosa-2,2.96,3.19,3.19,,3.098
50,Manan S.,"Woodridge, IL",0,2,,1.0,2017-10-12,"The worst experience of my life. They had LIVE WORMS in brockley, i took out my staff for a lunch and we had ordered daily specials. After a while the lunch came and after taking a few bites, my friend noticed there were live worms in brockley, and we started checking we all saw the same. The food ordered by all of us had mostly brockley in it and we had to stop. Called the manager and he apologized but due to the sheer shock, we decided to walk out of the restaurant, to never come back again. I still can't fathom the fact that a restaurant that charges this premium of a price, can't take care of basic food etiquette. Of course never going back again and I don't think this guys are going to learn but others had to be warned.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wauwatosa-2,2.96,3.17,3.17,,3.086
101,T W.,"Sheboygan, WI",0,3,,2.0,2017-10-27,"We had lunch here today. My chicken salad sandwich was a disgusting mess. Too much mayo on and in the sandwich, to much butter or whatever they use on the bread to grill it. I ate one of the 3 pieces of the sandwich. I told our server the sandwich was bad. Her response was I'll tell the kitchen. No offer to remove it from our bill or get me another sandwich. The food here is pricy and I doubt I will return to this restaurant or location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wauwatosa-2?start=20,3.0,3.16,3.16,,3.0960000000000005
49,Tom R.,"Milford, CT",0,29,,3.0,2017-11-19,"OK - if you've ever been to Cheesecake Factory, you're well aware that they're pretty consistent no matter what city you're in. Decent food, nothing fancy. This review is about a horrible drink experience at the Mayfair Mall location Wauwatosa, WI. I ordered  classic Margarita but what I was served was indescribably bad. I still can't figure out what the horrible taste in that drink was! I sent it back and opted to play it safe with a bottled beer which to 30 minutes to to brought over (after I had to ask the waiter what was up). Clearly, a bartender who was in need of retraining.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wauwatosa-2,3.08,3.14,3.14,,3.1160000000000005
47,Jeffrey C.,"Racine, WI",0,5,,3.0,2017-12-24,"Food was great as usual. Every time we come back it seems that the service gets worse. We waited over 10 minutes before we were even greeted. Then we had to wait an additional 10 minutes for our drinks. My girlfriend addressed the issue with a manager who provided us a free appetizer. Another issue was we weren't provided with knifes to butter our bread. It seems the service is slipping, but thank you to the manager the provided us with an appetizer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wauwatosa-2,3.0,3.13,3.13,,3.078

Food was good. Drinks were tasty but very weak. I had banana cream cheesecake, yum!!!! Very good experience besides the weak drinks and it was pretty pricey.
