249,Yelper I.,"San Diego, CA",0,69,,3.0,2012-07-09,"I'm from Manhattan. That makes me a food snob. I prefer independent restaurants and generally avoid chains (I also generally avoid New Jersey). Anyway, as it happened, I was on my way back from a day trip in Sussex County and had very few late-night options. So... Cheesecake Factory, here we come. My wife, niece, and I experienced some food quality problems with beef sliders (a shared appetizer) and Thai chicken pasta (a shared entree). I won't bore you with the details, because they honestly weren't severe and I was prepared to happily ignore them. But... when the manager heard about the problems, she came over to the table, apologized, and - without hesitation - comped the whole meal. EVERYTHING. FREE. Then she bought us three desserts and coffees on the house. Her name is Janice and her genuine friendliness and customer orientation made us forget all about the minor hiccups. Seriously, she's a great ambassador for the brand. Are you listening Mr. Cheesecake? The truth is that I'm unlikely to go to any Cheesecake Factory again (because I prefer not to eat in a factory). However, for those who like to get a week's worth of sodium in a single appetizer... for those who have never actually tasted Thai food... and for those whose mouths are so big that a full-sized hamburger feels like a ""slider""...

For about $100 for four with tax and tip, you get a choice meal with something for everyone, including two drinks, and two desserts. Plan on $140 if everyone has one drink and one dessert. The service is consistently good, and you can tell that Cheesecake Factory recruits and trains well. We had one handicapped person...very accommodating. Desserts are a favorite with some family members. Tip:  Ask the price of any specials to avoid surprises. I ordered catfish, pecan crusted with two sides...most excellent for $17. Tip 2:  Call ahead to ask about wait times. Can be over an hour at peak times. Drinks are generally over-priced compared with the price of the meal.

The service is so good here, that one time I was here with my friends and the waiter came to the table to see if we were happy with our dishes. My friend said that it wasn't what he expected.  They took the dish back and let him order something else!  No questions asked!  If that's not great service than I don't know what good service is!

For an entree unusually get the bang bang chicken and shrimp. The seared Tuna Tataki Salad is also a good choice!

As of tonight I can tell you I will never go back to the one at Willowbrook mall in Wayne. I was craving some sort of sweet dessert so my boyfriend and I decided this would be a great place to go; he could get dinner and I could satisfy my sweet tooth.  We were seated right away but it took the waiter a good 5-10 minutes to come over and grunt at us - yes,  he actually grunted. He was completely miserable the entire time we were there. Inattentive, rude, and absentee are the nicest ways to describe the service. Then there was the food, the only thing that wasn't awful was my chocolate milkshake. I ordered the apple crisp, and was not impressed in the slightest. Mostly nuts and whipped cream with very little apple or what is usually added for ""crisp"". My boyfriend got the pan seared salmon with angel hair pasta. He was nice enough to wait for my food to get to the table before he started eating, unfortunately this lead to another 10 minute wait and his food being almost cold by the time he got to eat it. The pasta was definitely microwaved, clumped together, dry, and completely disgusting. The salmon was ok, but not well cooked by any means.  When the waiter asked how everything was, we told him about the issue with the pasta. Wet got another grunt, no apology, and he walked away. We figured a manager would be forthcoming at that point, and he was, again after a decent (15 minute) wait. The manager sort of half assedly apologized but explained that if the pasta stays in the window too long waiting to be delivered it gets dry and can stick. When the bill came we were shocked to see that we were still being charged the full $17 for his meal - even though half of it had been inedible.  Between the terrible service and the bad food, nothing could get me back into this restaurant.

In detail: the steak was burned on the outside.  Medium-well is not an excuse to add charcoal to the steak.  The fish tacos had no flavor; various alternative sauces and apologies were administered to no success.  The quintessential picky-child ""pasta with garlic butter and Parmesan"" option tasted off, due to the cheese (too smoky). The Tots were tasty; the Cuban sandwich appetizer was terrific and well-worth a second try.  The battered Buffalo chicken was good, interesting in its execution.  The Ahi Carpaccio was a good try but the soy and guacamole didn't cut it for me.   The brownie sundae was too large by half, and so much whipped cream to avoid.  Overly rich.  Just not for me and my male endocrine system.  The apple crisp was a much better choice but too big for my son.  On reflection it would serve our family of four. I expected more tap choices for beer; in fact, I expected many craft beers but I guess that's not what CF is all about.  I didn't go wrong with a Sam Adams Seasonal -- no one ever has. The water flowed freely and service was very attentive, polite, apologetic of our concerns and lent the third star to the review.   In all, this reminded me of a diner with a grander vision than it could properly execute.  The service was outstanding, literally standing apart from many other dining experiences in the last year.  So, perhaps with a different mindset I'd return, but it's not likely.  Too many other local choices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wayne?start=140,2.72,2.72,2.72,3.0200000000000005,2.72

I'm proud to say that I'm adding TCF to that list. On a serious note everything about this place screams confusion. There's so much going on with the menu that you may come off indecisive if your waiter or waitress approaches you within 5 minutes of being seated (which our waiter did).  We started off with Tapas which consisted of Chicken Samosas, Mini Corn Dogs, & Cuban Rollers. Nothing was up to par when it came to the Tapas. My mommy ordered  the Chicken Madeira & Steak Diane as her entree. My dad ordered the Hibachi Steak as his entree. I ordered the Bang-Bang Chicken & Shrimp entree which wasn't good at all.  My meal was drenched in Curry Sauce & seemed as if an entire bottle of Coconut shavings was sprinkled all over my food. The Chicken & Shrimp was not served over the rice. It actually surrounded the Brown Rice that was placed in the middle of the plate. I ended up sending it back because it was painfully awful to take another bite. I couldn't pretend to enjoy my meal even if my life depended on it.  The waiter took it back without any qualms & replaced my entree with the Chicken Madeira & Steak Diane entree. My side was an order of Sweet Potato Fries. My entree was great. The only negative thing I'll say about it was the saltiness of the Sweet Potato Fries. A sprinkle of Sea Salt would've sufficed.  What's up with the extremely dim lights? I can't see what I'm ordering. I can't see what I'm eating.

There is a bar area which is self seated. It's pretty big area. Drinks are awesome n usual at other bars. TVs in bar area where u can sit n watch games.   Service- I always experienced a good service whenever I go. They are so busy at times but they make sure to give their customers best service.  There are managers walking around making sure customers are being helped.  Waiters are all dressed in white n a so nice n peaceful.  The one who served us last night,  his name was andrew. A very nice man who was so polite to us. He got us waters n deserts. He kept checking on us from time to tone of we were ok n need something.  He also told us  that he is serving other tables which was big but if we need anything just call for him.  That thought was very considerate.  Food!- i know food here is awesome,  no matter what u order.  I always get the little egg rolls things worn this green chutney ...Mmmmm delicious.  I love threw green chutney perfect! . My fav is Sante fe salad with chicken with that green chutney. They have lot of other choice in food which are delicious. Let's move to Deseret,  best thing about cheesecake.  I usually order the double chocolate tall tower cake. Mmmmm personally I love chocolaty n so good. But late night we decided to order white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake. It's little lemony n has this little hint of crunchyness in it. I b loved it.  Also ordered triamusu,  which as usual was good.  Cheesecake factory makes the best cakes n cheesecakes ever.

146,Chavon W.,"West Orange, NJ",18,30,3.0,1.0,2015-03-04,"Worst experience ever! I visited this Cheesecake factory with my family, on a week night last week. First, the server was not attentive and seemed disinterested in serving us. Some of our utensils and bread plates had dried food on them. Then, when we asked for hot water to at least feel better about the rest of them, the server seemed to not care what was wrong. Then, my cajun jambalaya was an oily mess. It was the worst ever, and I ALWAYS order the cajun jambalaya. When I told the server that I didn't want it, she took the plate away without even asking ""why"" or ""if she could get me anything else"".  Finally, as we were leaving, I stood at the hostess stand watching the hostess and 3 other employees engage in a spirited, and obviously personal, conversation. After about 5 minutes, the hostess comes over and asks me if I would like a table for 2. I said no, I'd like a manager. She gave me a generic, restaurant business card, with no name or anything else. Needless to say, I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wayne?start=120,3.08,3.25,3.25,2.724,3.182

But trust me each and every word of appreciation I have heard in my entire life was true. There is no match to the flavor that I experienced at this amazing place. I can literally still remember the taste of the cheesecakes I had. I went to the CCF with 6 friends, so we decided to order several cheesecakes and share them. We had the white chocolate raspberry, banana cream, oreo, Dulce de leche, strawberry, cherry and the tuxedo cheesecake. Tuxedo was on the heavy side but the other ones were memorable, especially the strawberry one (well for my friends the oreo and the banana cream ones were the finest). It was a cheesecake party, seven people and seven different cheesecakes. The prices were totally worth the flavors.

My family and I had never been here before and rather than hitting Red Lobster like we always usually do, we decided to check this place out to see if it was anything like the one up in Boston that we'd go to when I was a student up there. And it was. It definitely was. Same inner decor which is hip and nice, and a HUGE menu that always makes it nearly impossible to decide on anything because there's just so much delicious sh*t. I finally settled on angel hair pasta with shrimp, my dad has fish and chips, and mom had Indian samosas with a beet salad. All very tasty, though my mom said the fries weren't crispy enough. Very good and attentive and friendly service. Only downside, it did all turn out to be more expensive than what was originally estimated and although we had a great tasty time, the food is not quite deserving of those prices.

192,Tudii N.,"West Orange, NJ",19,28,10.0,1.0,2015-04-03,Not a good time. Most over rated place. I was really craving a steak when I came in so I ordered the coulette steak medium well. The steak came out bleeding. I couldn't report it to my server until she came over 15 mins later. She took it back to be cooked more. It came out 10 mins later- COLD everything oh wait and still bleeding in not sure what exactly they did. A manager didn't come over to apologize or anything and I asked for A1 sauce and they didn't have any! What?! That's like serving French fries and having no ketchup?! I couldn't believe it and I was pissed off. $85 bill for a shitty steak and a decent burger. The seating of the place is set up that you can't even have a personal conversation with anyone ur with. Because someone else is sitting directly beside you and you don't even know them. No place to hang your jacket so everything is bunched up near your neighboring diner with another servers butt in your face. Our server didn't pre bus unless I asked her to and when I did she took two small plates and left the rest to clutter. -_-  I had to move all of our dishes to a nearby table. Then at the end we asked for a refill of lemonade. She asked for the the old cup he has the first lemonade out of. I told her it was removed from the table. Then she said we couldn't get a refill without the original cup. WHAT?!  she said she will get it anyway and came back with a small togo cup. That was it for us. She lucky she got a tip to be honest.

Located inside Williowbrook Mall, it offers tons of seating and loads of food options. The menu is so varied, it's sometimes overwhleming. From the brunch/breakfast menu to the salads, sandwiches, pastas, entrees and drinks, not to mention their infamous cheesecake, no one can come here and say they can't find something to eat. The porions are humongous! Come here with an appetite. There's a good chance if you get an app and a meal, you'll be bringing some food home with you! The decor is nice; the same as any Cheesecake Factory (it's a chain), and the bar is large and inviting, with ample bar and table seating. What's nice about this location is the outdoor seating, albeit, it faces the mall parking lot. The service is OK; it seems a little scattered at times. Between the servers and the food runners, there's so much service, but most times it can be just too much or even too little. Its location makes it tough to get a seat at lunch and dinner hours, especially on weekends and they don't take reservations, but it's great to pop in for a bite or cocktail when you need a break from shopping!

I was seated right away and greeted with a warm smile by one of the waitresses, her name was Michele, with one ""L"", we made made a joke about that, so I would refer to her as ""Michele with one L"" whenever I saw her. I ordered a Long Island Iced Tea, and also ordered one of my favorite meals there, Shepherd's Pie. Everything was delicious, and I was quite stuffed. ""Don't forget to leave room for Cheesecake!"" Said Michele with one ""L"". Well, how could I not listen to that wonderful advice! As I looked through the menu, Michele with one ""L"" noticed I was struggling, I am after all, very indecisive. She recommended the new Salted Caramel Cheesecake, so I decided to go for it! I tell you this, I've been to the Cheesecake Factory many times, and that was perhaps the best Gosh darn cheesecake I have ever had!

We started off with the stuffed mushroom  appetizer and an order of nachos . I also ordered a small snack plate which was the Greek salad . We have no complaints about the beginning of the meal because that was pretty good .  Then we ordered dinner which was a disaster and very expensive . My husband ordered the shrimp and angel hair pasta which was very very dry. There was hardly any sauce on the pasta. He had  just a bowl full of angel hair pasta and 4 shrimp. My daughter ordered the herb crusted salmon. It was flavorless and dry. The mashed potatoes that came with her dish was very dry and seemed like it came out of a box. My youngest daughter ordered the fried shrimp and french fries. The shrimp tasted like it had been fried in old burnt oil. The shrimp had too much mushy crunchy batter and was not fresh tasting at all. The food last night was just horrible.  To end our night we ordered desert.  I ordered a  strawberry cheesecake and my youngest ordered a Godiva Chocolate brownie sundae. Desert was good. No complaints with desert.  I mentioned to the waitress that my husband's  food was very dry and she just said Oh and walked away. She did nothing or asked no other questions. We got our bill which was $120.74 and of course included suggested gratuity which is super annoying after you have had bad food and mediocre service.  We paid the lowest , 15% on the receipt which was $18.11 and then we just left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wayne?start=140,3.2,3.21,3.21,2.244,3.206

I do like that they have a whole ""skinnylicious"" menu. Some restaurants have their light options and list 4-6 options. This has a lot of great choices. And as cheesecake is a requirement, it's usually best to go light for the entree. I always try to try a different cheesecake, so this time went with the 30th anniversary which is ""Layers of Our Original Cheesecake, Fudge Cake and Chocolate Truffle Cream."" It was rich and sweet without going overboard, although with the size of the slices (and the cost) you really have to share. Still every slice I've had has been so tasty but I only indulge on rare occasions.

She also was very knowledgeable of the menu, knowing lunch sizes and if there were options we had to choose from. The atmosphere was pretty dark but the snow outside brightened up the room. The music was stuff you'd hear from a light alternative playlist on spotify. Our family ordered the ahi tartare as an appetizer and I ordered the Firecracker Salmon because I wasn't that hungry. The ahi tartare was really good. The chips were incredibly crunchy and added to the texture of the raw fish. The avocado cooled things down and added flavor to the soy ginger sauce. It had a tangy and nutty flavor to it. The firecracker salmon was pretty good. Wrapped in a crisp wrapper tied off with some spinach. The salmon was pretty good, spiced but I couldn't taste it because the spinach kind of took over the show. Otherwise the sweet hot chili sauce made up for it.

So, like I stated, we got there before the rush and were sat promptly and our server was soon at our table.  We ordered an app, stuffed mushrooms.  They were ""Ok"" and came with a serving of 6.  Very small and for 7 bucks, no bang for your buck with these.  We'll pass next time. The sauce the mushrooms were served in was really good tho, and good for bread dippin'.  For our meals, we ordered salads.  Mine was the Chinese Chicken Salad Dinner portion - Chicken Breast, Rice Noodles, Lettuce, Green Onions, Almonds, Crisp Wontons, Bean Sprouts, Orange and Sesame Seeds. Tossed in Our Special Chinese Plum Dressing.  Very big salad!!!!!  I couldn't even finish it and it was pretty good and flavorful.  My wife ordered the Sheila's Chicken and Avocado Salad Lunch portion - Grilled Chicken, Fresh Avocado, Mixed Greens, Crisp Tortilla Strips, Carrots, Cilantro and Cashews Tossed in a Citrus-Honey-Peanut Vinaigrette.  This was pretty damn big as well for the lunch portion!  My wife and I both thought the salads almost tasted the same and hers didn't come with that many Avocado's, and being that was in the title, you'd expect a few more.  So, why 3 stars?  Well, it took forever to get our appetizer - then our meals.  I think the server forgot to put in our order after taking it because it took almost 20 minutes to get our mushrooms... then another 20-25 mins for our Salads.  We then saw other tables get their food before us, and those tables were sat well after we arrived - and we ordered Salads.. how long does it take to make two salads?  It wasn't that busy when we arrived, so that's why I am pretty sure our order was forgotten about.  On an good note, our server was very polite and attentive.  I can't give 4 stars for the experience, but I'll chalk this up as a hiccup on her part.  I'd return for a meal as I saw other things that looked really good and man, the portions are huge!!!  The Factory is recommended.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wayne?start=20,3.0,3.02,3.02,3.0200000000000005,3.0120000000000005

Drinks are also great, but a little on the pricier side (prices for drinks are not listed on the menu) and I've also had some pretty great appetizers there as well. The only downside is that they don't take reservations so I've had to wait 1.5-2 hours for a table (party of 2) for dinner.

Avocado egg rolls were pretty good but again not worth the $11. I think you can sense the theme here. The place has mediocre food at best for ridiculous prices. Our server(Brandon) was very helpful.

We came on Wednesday night at around 7:00 PM with no wait and the restaurant wasn't too crowded. For an appetizer we ordered calamari and it came out right away. The calamari itself was good but all of the breading fell off of it, so that was the downside of the calamari. My mom and I ordered the shrimp scampi combo with the herb crusted salmon. The combos are good because you can mix and match them (there are other seafood or chicken options) and the serving is worth the price of the dish ~$21. I was just sad that the scampi didn't come with angel hair pasta because that is my favorite! But it did come with a huge heaping of mashed potatoes. After our entrees came out, then we got the complimentary bread which I had been waiting for. It came when we were partially finished with our entrees but that was ok because we just took it home and I ate it for breakfast the next day lol! For dessert we ordered the macadamia nut white chocolate caramel cheesecake. It was good but I wish that the macadamia nuts were chopped into smaller pieces. Our waiter was very friendly. Overall impressed with the good service! Also, I really like that the menu has so many different options.

First off, I came here with my brother and a cousin of mine on a Wednesday for a quick lunch. We shared a fried mac & cheese, plus a basil tomato flatbread for an app, and both were delicious. Food came out fairly  quick, which is always a plus. Second course: I got the veggie burger with sweet potato fries, my brother got the veggie burger on the ""skinnylicious"" menu, which is just a smaller portion and comes with a side salad, and my cousin got chipotle pasta with shrimp. Food was good per usual. When I had my first bite of my veggie burger, I almost thought I was eating meat. They do a pretty good job with this dish I think. I had a bite of my cousin's food and I don't think CCF is a top option for a pasta dish but it wasn't bad. Overall, food was good.  Negatives: No names will be mentioned but the server I had seemed very unmotivated and careless. I guess because a few workers there know I used to work in a restaurant, they don't seem motivated to work for their tip because they know I will leave 20% or more every time. He/she had one or two other tables and spent a decent amount of time by the host stand conversing with co-workers. The table right next to us sat before us and left before us as well. Service was just really slow. My card was on the table for a good 10 minutes before the server noticed. Maybe it was just an off day so it really wasn't a big deal, but I can't ever stress enough how much service makes or breaks an experience at a restaurant.

I can only speak to the taste of the spaghetti and meatballs since it's what I ordered, but the others seemed to enjoy their dishes. The dish was large, of course, so I'm happy. Additionally, the noodles were cooked al dente and were covered in a very aromatic sauce. The meatballs were definitely homemade and were a bit on the dryer/tougher side.

Thank you for caring enough to make it right for me - this issue below was resolved to my complete satisfaction. @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ Very poor service! Left in a back corner of restaurant and forgotten about by our server- Super slow to take order- Food finally arrived- but was missing some components that we requested- but how would she know since she didn't come back after the meal was delivered by someone else- She finally checked on how our meal was after we were basically finished-  We told her about the missing items- and that's when service got even slower- Finally got check after an extended wait- We asked at front desk for a comment card.  Hostess was dumbfounded as to what we were asking about-we explained it was a little thing many restaurants have to get feedback about our experience- of course they didn't ask if we had had a problem-she ended up giving us a business card.

Everything was going fine until I came across a massive hair in my grilled steak tacos. This was very off-putting since it was my first time dining at this restaurant. I do not think I will be returning for a second time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wayne,2.84,3.04,3.1,,2.9600000000000004

My favorite of the two they give you.   Some other reviewers have had issues with servers.  I never had an issue.  They have always been friendly, attentive and helpful.   I tried quite a few items on the menu and have not been disappointed.   I love all the cheesecakes here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wayne,2.76,3.03,3.096,,2.9219999999999997

13,Maria B.,"Lyndhurst, NJ",28,6,,1.0,2018-01-07,Hostesses are very rude they don't even acknowledge you and then took other names first I walked right out after the second person was taken before me. Never going back,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wayne,2.88,3.0,3.1,,2.9520000000000004
4,Warren B.,"Morristown, NJ",1086,153,88.0,1.0,2018-01-08,"Fast casual spelled Performance Food Group. (Not a heavy hitter in quality food)  Certainly not a place I would venture inside. If the corral of baby carriages doesn't send you running for the door the sound of shrieking babies will.  There is nothing on the vapid menu that is made from scratch, but this won't matter to you because the Cheesecake Factory is just that.  Freezer to plate cooking.  If you care about the quality of your food, you'll pass.  If you don't care, this is your kind of place.  Feeding over dining.  Fail.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wayne,2.88,2.97,3.088,,2.934
