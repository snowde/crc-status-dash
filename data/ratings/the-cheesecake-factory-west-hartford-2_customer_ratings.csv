133,Byron D.,"West Hartford, CT",147,372,256.0,3.0,2012-01-21,"Friday night - 45 minute wait..  Everyone in good spirits - Bar area packed. The service here is really well executed.  Well trained waitstaff , an improvement over my last visit.  The bread..  I liked the brown bread! (Molasses maybe?) The Food:   If you leaf through the menu, there are so many choices it boggles the mind.  How can they prepare so many entrees that are so varied?  The kitchen..  It is ENORMOUS.  You can see a line of cooks plating meals prior to serving them.  This is barely 20% of the kitchen, the real work goes on out back.  This is a really large institutional type operation, not unlike a  high end, well run cafeteria.  The food was fine, ordered three apps, that were tasty.  I was underwhelmed with the main course, and did not bother to finish my entree.   I was a bit put off by their beer offerings as well.  Blue Moon & Sam Adams?    These choices are fine for many folks, but if I am going out to one of the restaurants in the area, I want some interesting beer.  If you are dining with a large group of picky people who have varied tastes..  you could do well to have the event here.  If there is a type of cuisine you are seeking in particular, go local!  This would be a fall back position as a last resort. Carbone's / Bricco - Italian  (Carbone's if it is romantic that you want!) Besito - Mexican (nice dinning)  Plan B - Beef n Beer  (casual) East West Grill - Thai Awesome (not upscale, former diner) Pond House - Eclectic - never disappoints (Brunch great too!)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-hartford-2?start=200,3.24,3.24,3.24,2.8280000000000003,3.2400000000000007
304,Hansen C.,"Hartford, CT",2,18,,2.0,2012-02-13,"The description for the 2 star review on here fits Cheesecake Factory perfectly-- ""Meh. I've experienced better."" I personally have a hard time seeing this place as anything but a chain restaurant, and patrons are blinded by its marketing. This is the type of place you'd frequent if you think Panera is a cute, quaint little cafe. The 2 stars are for the cheesecake alone, which in actuality is delicious, but I HIGHLY doubt they're even prepared fresh on premises. All in all, it's an Applebee's with marble floors (but even the entrees at Applebees may be better)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-hartford-2?start=280,3.24,3.24,3.24,2.7280000000000006,3.2400000000000007

153,Sayya A.,"Saint Albans, United Kingdom",38,42,91.0,4.0,2012-02-14,"I don't care what anyone says I love The Cheesecake Factory because it's a one size fit all restaurant that has selections available for everyone. This is the place you go when you're out with a group of friend and you don't want to make anyone uncomfortable. Especially when there is a vegetarian or a dieter this is the place you pick because it will save tons of bickering and hurt feelings.  I always turn to The Cheesecake Factory because of the extensively long menu.  I can take my picky fish eating sister here and I know for sure she will be able to find something she likes.  Wait: The place is right in the center of ""The Center"". The wait can be as long as 45 minutes. But when with friends just find a spot on one of the few couches and wait for your pager to alarm.  The wait shouldn't be a problem when out with friends because you're there to spend time with your friends. If you're out with your partner, consider it time to share an uncomfortable moment.  They have pagers that will work if you want to head to the bookstore. Folks it really isn't that bad.  Food: HUGE portions that will satisfy everyone. The food isn't comparable to the likes of Max and Grants but they cater to mainstream diners. I like their nachos for sharing and the firecrackers are good too but they leave me craving for more.  I come for the cheesecake. I'm not cheesecake expert but I love the selection and the variety.  I've had bakery made cheesecakes and was never impressed. Many bakeries will charge you the same price as The Cheesecake but their cheesecakes usually aren't of the same sugar fused sugar coma stimulating cheesecakes that can only be found at the Cheesecake factory.  I usually start working on my cheesecake at the restaurant, pack it to go, work on it for a late night snack, have some more for a mini breakfast snack, nibble some for lunch and finish it off for my pre dinner snack. Seriously the cheesecakes here are huge and it is well worth the calories. Price: For the dieters who want smaller portions you can pay around $15 and get something that's of a healthy portion. For those who are eating machines like me expect to pay $20 an entrée. Add a $7 piece of cheesecake in and you'll be wiggling to your car with a full belly.  Service: I can't complain but I detect lots of servers here with the fake nice attitude. They come to your tables, force a smile and then expect an amazing tip.  Parking: Garage parking. No other Cheesecake factory in the state so either you pay for parking or go without Cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-hartford-2?start=160,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.9280000000000004,3.3200000000000003

I ordered lemon zest ricotta pancakes with fresh strawberries.  Pancakes were ordinary, I could hardly taste any lemon, the ricotta was just haphazardly scattered on the plate, not integrated into the pancakes, and the strawberries were cooked and reduced, so it wasn't readily apparent whether they were fresh or not.  So, you ask... what was I really eating?   Not entirely sure.  I might as well have gone to the local diner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-hartford-2?start=220,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.7600000000000007,3.2800000000000002

Your menu reads like a novel, it's 28 pages including advertisements.  I have to ask, what's your average table time, because surely a 28 page document takes some time to get through. The shrimp n grits were awesome, i wish i could have gotten a bigger portion (they were on the tapas menu).  Although the shrimp on the top of the pile with a huge black vein running through it was pretty off putting. My ""navajo"" fry bread sandwich was BLAND BLAND BLAND.  Even salt couldn't revive it.  And the chicken was cooked beyond recognition, it was drier than the mojave.  My fries were the bottom of the barrel, dry and cold, mixed with burnt bits & scraps from the other fry bins.  I could only tell because my wife's fries were straight from the fryer, golden & delicious. Consistency is a problem here, except with dessert, the cheesecake is always good, and may be the only reason to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-hartford-2?start=200,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.8240000000000003,3.1200000000000006
233,Christopher C.,"Naugatuck, CT",6,70,,4.0,2012-03-31,"I ate here for the first time today and even though there was a 45 minute wait for a table they did give us a wireless pager that tells you when your table is available... so we walked around this beautiful section of West Hartford while we waited.  The service was excellent. The waitress was very nice and checked on our table 5 times, which seems to be rare these days. Most of the places you eat at you're lucky if the server checks on you 3 times. The menu is huge with a wide variety of foods. I know a lot of people dislike large menus but for me personally I am big on variety and it is nice to have a wide selection. I chose the chicken stuffed soft tacos which comes with black beans and a small corndish. I'm not a big fan of corn dishes but that was the first thing I tried and it wasn't bad, however the cream that comes on top of it tasted a bit out of place. The black beans were quite good, but it's just black beans. The chicken stuffed soft tacos were pretty darn good. They were stuffed with all the usual ingredients and topped with melted cheese, salsa, and finely diced tomatoes. It was quite good. My only complaint at all is it was slightly bland for my taste, but I tend to have greedy taste buds and like things having a bit more kick than the average person. The portions are huge, some of the biggest I have ever seen, in fact. You have to be mighty hungry to finish it all in one service. The cheesecakes are just absolutely perfect, and with such a wide selection I doubt you'd ever get bored trying them. They also have some light cheesecake selections for those on a diet and the same goes for the entree menu. Overall it was a very enjoyable experience. However make sure to bring a big wad of cash when you come here. Also be prepared for a very loud environment as this place seems to be packed to the brim at all times. PS - Giving a place low rating because its food has high calories is STUPID! I can't believe how many negative reviews I see based on the lack of health food. if you want health food go to a health food store and buy it. Obviously a place called CHEESECAKE FACTORY is not going to have much low-fat low-calorie food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-hartford-2?start=260,3.08,3.08,3.08,3.024,3.0800000000000005

The portions are very generous and the quality of the food is ""average-to-great"".  Service is typically good, both with the personnel and the time to order and have your meals prepared.   The two main things that avert me from dining at CheeseCake more often is (1) The lllooooonnnnnnnggggg wait (every half hour that elapsed, they'll tell you it will be only 5 more minutes - Don't fall for it; You'll be there for a 'minute', trust me!); (2) Encyclopedia-like menu to select from - By the time I got to page 22 of the menu, I forgot what I wanted for Appetizer from page 9 thru 12, and then couldn't make up my mind for desserts, which were in pages 40 thru 66 (I'm exaggerating just a tad about all the pages, but you feel my drift!)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-hartford-2?start=220,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.8920000000000003,3.1600000000000006

122,Jim B.,"Glastonbury, CT",0,19,,2.0,2012-04-28,"I don't quite understand the attraction this place has. First you have a 30+ minute wait (regardless of when you go). Then you get slow service and food that really isn't very good at all. I've heard that the salads are huge and awesome. Well, they are huge -- but a large Carleton salad was almost all lettuce and nothing else. The New Orleans Shrimp was called ""mildly spicy"" in the menu, so I asked the waitress if they could make it ""moderately spicy"". Sure, no problem. Well, the result was extremely bland, about one step more flavorful than cafeteria food. I can only imagine what ""mildly spicy"" would have been. Now the cheesecake for dessert could very well be terrific, but we opted out. After waiting over 5 minutes for a dessert menu, I lost my appetite. Perhaps next time, I'll just go to the dessert counter and get a slice of cheesecake to go and skip the awful meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-hartford-2?start=200,3.36,3.36,3.36,2.7600000000000007,3.3600000000000003

That is masterd recipe. It spicey yummy crunchy and I just cant explain how good it is. You must try it! Cheesecakes are incredibly good. The pineapple upside down! and Godiva chocolate cheese cake are my favorties! Bit overpriced... but hey its west hartford. Servers are sometime stuck up... not sure why?!?

The atmosphere:  Was great.  It was a little loud in there, but we were there in the middle of a Sunday afternoon and it looked like there were several large parties celebrating graduations.  :)  The place was packed! The wait time:  Eh, it was OK.  I think we waited 10 or so minutes?  They wouldn't let my friend put her name in until we were all present, which I kind of get, but is annoying. The menu:  Is long.  And it has ads in it.  I've never seen that before.  Does that make me unworldly?  But because there is so much that they offer, there is something for everyone.  They also have a special menu of reasonably-portioned meals. The food:  I have some food restrictions, but I try not to be obnoxious about them.  I had the turkey burger without the bun, and broccoli instead of the fries.  It was delicious!  And for dessert, the three of us split a slice of cheesecake three ways.  We go the key lime/mango, at our waitress's request, and it was such a good suggestion! The service:  Our waitress was very nice.  She was knowledgeable, flexible, and quick with the water.  But the food service felt kind of slow to me.  I don't think that was her fault.  I think that's because the kitchen was so jammed.

The cheesecake factory isn't really my kind of place but my friends chose it and they figured it'd be good for a larger group. I've been to the Cheesecake factory multiple times in Boston and Baltimore (always my boyfriend's choice)  when we've wanted to just get a quick, casual lunch usually while traveling. The food's always been fine, service fine, etc...a solid 3 stars.  But my latest experience in West Hartford has really soured me from this chain because of our server. She was completely transparent in that she did not want to be there and did not want to be serving our group. For such a low key, undemanding group of 9-10 people, I would have thought she'd have been happy for the opportunity to get a large and easy tip. I'm usually reluctant to criticize a server because  I understand it's hard work and that everybody can have a bad day. But I left the restaurant feeling almost insulted by her thinly veiled annoyance.   And now that's the feeling I will recall when I see a Cheesecake Factory...so no thanks to friends' future proposals of a Cheesecake Factory visit. I still gave this restaurant 3 stars because I believe one server does not reflect an entire restaurant or a typical experience at said restaurant. I spoke to another server during the same night who was extremely pleasant and helpful. Everybody in my group was also fine with their food and drinks and our  servers in the past have been fine.

Food - We didn't order apps, so on to the entrees. Portions shockingly small! Two of us got the steak and shrimp combo for $20. 3 pc shrimp, 4 pc beef.

So sweet but I finished it.  4. Conclusion - If I come back I'd go for the burger/sandwiches for like 12 bucks, it'll fill me up fine. But for that why not Max's burger or a more casual joint?

I have to dine at them sometimes while traveling for work but on my own time, I steer clear. I ended up at this CF because my dining companion had a gift card so we figured we'd grab some lunch. At noon on a Sunday there was no wait but it was pretty packed. Like with any chain, the food is the same here as it is in (FILL IN THE BLANK WITH ANY OTHER CF LOCATION).  CF's food is a notch above Applebee's or Chili's but hardly worth waiting 5 minutes for, let alone 2 hours.  I don't hate on CF just to hate on chain restaurants. For $25 for lunch, you can do so much better in West Hartford which is why I am always astounded by the lines at this place.

We waited roughly 15 minutes without even a hello from one of the many servers walking past us and staring. I finally decided to let the hostess know, in case no one had been informed. We waited another 5-10 minutes. A waitress finally peaked her head in and said she'd be back in a few minutes... hooray, not.  We ordered our food and drinks because god knows when we would see her again. We joked that our water wouldn't come until after our food.... but wait, we were right. We also ordered hot tea, with honey and lemon. That came much later, and without tea bags, and no honey or lemon. It was a terrible experience. We debated some cheese cake, but the check was dropped... so no go on that!  Overall I was very disappointed. Mediocre food, with terrible service.

94,Katie H.,"West Hartford, CT",297,327,77.0,3.0,2013-01-19,"I'd only ever had good experiences at the Cheesecake Factory before, but my last time there, I left disappointed. My favorite crab cake sandwich was no longer on the menu so I got the Chicken Bellagio, which came highly recommended by friends. It was just okay--tasty, but a little overpriced for what is your run-of-the-mill chicken and pasta dish. Perhaps I should have ordered something else. My friends got the orange chicken, lunch portion, which they all enjoyed. I tried some and while it was splendidly crispy, the slightly bitter rind flavor in the orange sauce wasn't to my liking. I'd eat it if it was in front of me, but probably not order it myself.  Our waiter was very chipper and friendly, but unfortunately, he got swamped with tables halfway through our meal and it was almost impossible to get his attention for anything. We waited for 15 minutes and eventually had to flag him down in order to order dessert, for which he just threw our menus down on his way to another table and had his busboy take our dessert orders. We then had to wait another 15 minutes to get our desserts, and my peanut butter, banana, and honey milkshake (good but a little too sweet) was mostly melted and soupy by that point. After that, we had to wait again before we could flag him down and get our bil and again for him to take it. Our lunch ended up taking over two hours because of all of this, and my friends had to dash off late to their next engagements. I know it wasn't our waiter's fault, as he was well and truly swamped and doing the best he could, but perhaps they should hire more waitstaff for the lunch shift to better handle all the tables.

Brought my friend and his gf out for his 30th birthday. I had chips and salsa app, and the salsa was fresh and hit the spot with the chips. The fresh bread they brought out was actually really delicious. I had the brown grain bread but it was so flavorful! My main course was the vegetable salad with no cheese or meat or dressing except a tablespoon of EVOO and it was exceptional. Hearty and hit the spot! I finished it with a bowl of fresh strawberries for dessert and those were plump, juicy and cold: just the way I like them! I was able to eat healthy and still have a delicious meal! My friend got the fried calamari for his app and said it was too 3 he's ever had. He got the ny sirloin and loved it. He ordered medium well but it came out medium/ medium rare which made me happier to see. He said it was still really good and it smelled incredible. His dessert was a banana chocolate honey milkshake which sounded great and he confirmed its yummyness. His gf ordered the avacado egg rolls for her app which look and sound good. She loves them. She got a Kobe burger with mushrooms and caramelized onions and bacon, cooked medium well (communists I'm telling you!), and said it could be the greatest burger she's ever had. Her dessert was a red velvet cheesecake with a hot caramel apple cider. She loved it all. I was jealous of their meals, but happy how everything went. Wasn't as pricey as I thought it would be which was nice. The waitress thought I was stingy because of my orders, then got her 30% tip and realized who she was talkin to!

In fact, it was so bland I didn't even want to lift my hand to put salt or A1 sauce on it. As for the rumored ""huge portions"": that's B.S.

227,Veronica M.,"New Britain, CT",3,12,2.0,4.0,2013-08-05,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of those places you go to for the experience.  This restaurant is perfectly located amongst many other businesses in a fairly quiet plaza with minimal car traffic which is what draws me to this place time and time again.  The food isn't anything too spectacular, but it isn't average either so you're guaranteed a delicious meal every time.  Back to the experience.  The ambiance in this restaurant is what earns its 4-stars and is better than anything I've ever experienced in any other restaurant.  It's romantic, it's intimate, and it delivers this each time without fail.  The wait may be long, sometimes up to 2 hours, but it's well worth it.  It's not overly loud or too quiet.  The staff is always friendly and there to cater to you while giving just enough space to make your dinner selections without feeling rushed or forgotten.  There are different options for seating whether you like sitting in a bar area, on an outdoor patio, or general booth seating.  A table for two may be somewhat uncomfortable so I'd steer clear of those, but the booths offer more than enough room to really feel comfy.  The high ceilings, architecture, and atmosphere all make this the perfect location for a date night.  Although the wait may seem too long to be worth it, the area makes for a perfect stroll during your wait which just adds to the experience of your evening.  If you're looking for a new place to dine and care more about having a lovely evening, this place will absolutely not disappoint.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-hartford-2?start=260,3.04,3.04,3.04,3.12,3.0400000000000005

100,Alfred F.,"Hartford, CT",123,193,197.0,3.0,2014-02-05,"One of the rare times we went out Friday night and went somewhere other than our go-to place. Guess we had a yen for something different...and Cheesecake Factory was the almost-unanimous choice. Nestled in ""beautiful"" Blue-Back Square in the center of West Hartford, Cheesecake Factory has been characterized by a thriving bar, a huge menu, a devilish listing of anthem-style desserts, and interminably long waits for a table. This evening, we were lucky, and only had to wait about 40 minutes. I will say that, once you are seated, the service and attention you receive are consistently very good. Within 2 minutes our waiter took our beverage order. He came back with the drinks, and CF's signature breads - sourdough and a dark multi-grain. Both were hot, soft and yummious. Our order was taken, and we began nibbling, sipping, and trying not to stare at the cheesecake station that was situated just a few feet from us. Our meals came in a very reasonable amount of time. All were hot, and well-presented. My wife had Chicken Marsala, which was wonderful looking, covered with fresh sauteed mushrooms, just the way she likes it. My daughter thoroughly enjoyed her trio of chicken tacos, which came with a small bowl of Mexican-style marinated vegetables, which for me was the highlight of the meal...they were extremely fresh, and complimented with a light cilantro-lime marinade that was perfectly balanced. I felt like some home-style comfort food, so i ordered the chicken & biscuits. 3 quaint chicken breasts, served over mashed potatoes with a few large biscuits, home-style gravy & mixed vegetables. It hit the spot. Dessert...well we were all too full to eat anything else, but that didn't stop us, of course, from ordering a few slices to go! we had apple, red velvet, and Godiva cheesecakes. All I can say is that if it weren't for a bit of well-placed discretion, the containers never would have made it to the recycling bin! The only annoyances were the usual wait, and the fact that we had to shell out $5 for parking. Other than that, Cheesecake Factory delivers everything you would expect...good food, friedly and efficient service, and CHEESECAKE!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-hartford-2?start=180,3.28,3.25,3.25,2.636,3.262
91,Biota M.,"Hartford, CT",262,157,304.0,4.0,2014-02-11,"My two friends and I went on a Monday night around 6:30 PM to celebrate a birthday, so our wait time was maybe two minutes. All the other times I've been here (generally Fridays or weekends), I've had to wait at least 45 minutes to an hour. A note on their reservation policy, they do take them, but only on certain days within certain times: - Monday-Friday from 11:30 AM - 5:00 PM - Sunday from 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM Certain holidays when they may get a lot of people coming in, they may revoke the reservation policy (such as Valentine's Day this Friday), so I would definitely call in advance to check. I've never gotten drinks here, but since we were celebrating a 21st birthday, that part was practically obligatory. I tried the Georgia Peach (very well made--just a sweet and fruity drink without any alcohol taste), and one friend got a pina colada (which didn't seem like anything out of the ordinary). Our drinks were $10 and $9.50, respectively, so I would suggest you save the money and order an extra piece of cheesecake to go instead. From my past experience, their entrees are hit or miss--especially considering the prices, which are usually on the higher end. But they do offer huge portions, so I usually end up eating half and then saving the rest for lunch the next day. I've tried the fish tacos, which were very mediocre. But on another occasion, the veggie burger was one of the best I've ever tried, and you can opt to have the veggie patty served without the bun and wrapped in iceberg lettuce for a healthier option. This time I tried their California omelette, subbing out the breakfast potatoes for mashed potatoes, and they were both excellent. For the toast, they only had white or wheat bread, and they overtoasted it to the point where it was almost inedible around the edges. They also didn't provide any butter with it (they had taken away the complimentary butter and bread basket at this point). Service has always been great here. Servers fill your glasses without prompting, and they're good about checking on you throughout the meal. The cheesecake is really the main reason that I would choose this restaurant over most others. Don't care how full I am from the rest of the meal--I'll always be getting dessert! My favorites are the Godiva chocolate cheesecake and the 30th Anniversary chocolate cake cheesecake. If you're getting a drink/appetizer, entree, and dessert, plan to spend around $40/person (not including tip).

I just had to wait a half hour for a table and my table is now in the BAR. If I wanted to eat at a bar I wouldn't have gone to this restaurant.  I ordered another drink to calm my nerves and ordered an appetizer. The crab wontons - so good. Super unhealthy but it was a cheat meal.  For dinner I ordered the fettuccine with chicken, roasted red tomatoes & a garlic sauce. It was the worst and most bland pasta I've ever tasted. I dont think there was one bit of garlic in it. I took about 4 bites and wrapped the rest... to be thrown out at home. I of course ordered some cheesecake - the snickers one. It was so good. Standard cheesecake nothing to freak out about.

I like that they have a small plates menu and skinny menu since their normal portions are huge. I love their avocado egg rolls and tex mex eggrolls. However, their dynamite shrimp was not so good. From the description, I thought it was a spicy sauce like a chinese hot and sour sauce, but it was basically mayo with some cajun(?) spices. Pretty bland.  Many of their meals are mediocre too. I've gotten their alfredo shrimp pasta and it was just okay. Love their salads - fresh lettuce and ingredients. I stole their BBQ Ranch chicken Salad idea and make it at home all the time. It is SO SO good, but a lot of work so I still get it when I go there sometimes.  Really, their menu is huge. Finding something that sounds good won't be hard, but picking something that is actually tasty can be a gamble.  Their cheesecakes though, always a safe bet.

Menu is huge.  Many selections.  Easy to get confused. Most restaurant ""experts"" recommend a smaller choice of menu items.  Cheesecake Factory apparently believes the opposite.  But my wife and I have a favorite.  It is Chicken Romano..   We both always order this item and the meal  is always good and we take home half  of our meal. Service is always good.   The restaurant offers two choices of bread.  The bread is tasty..  We went on a Monday night in August.  Still had to wait thirty minutes but it was worth the wait.. Our other Cheesecake factory we go to a lot is the location in Boca Raton, Florida.  As good as the West Hartford, Ct. location. We always order one slice of a cheesecake ( different one each time).  We splint the slice.  Delicious and fatting. One suggestion: Each Holiday season. After Thanksgiving, each $25.00 Gift card purchased gets you a bonus gift card for a  slice of Cheesecake ( usually you must redeem these bonus cards in the winter months).  Cheesecake will let you redeem as many gift cards you have at any time as long as you do it in the time allowed.  We redeem several at one time and took them home.

Even though the corporatization of The Cheesecake Factory soars ever upward (HDTVs flashing high-resolution images of the same desserts served from the display cases below... seriously?), they are worthy of some praise, and the primary reason is value. Almost all of the entrees are below $20, with many sandwiches in the $12-14 range. Cheesecake is $7.50, and slices are easily shareable. Considering the high-class atmosphere they seek to put forth here, I think it's fair to say that you can have a very reasonably-priced meal at TCF. It took a recent visit to Fleming's (another chain restaurant) to realize all this. When a brief scan of the menu led us to realize that a Fleming's dinner would likely make us $150 poorer, The Cheesecake Factory started to look like an unmitigated bargain. It's pretty good.

Weeknight dinners have been an easy in and easy out experience. Up until our last experience we usually get the easy(low $) salads and burgers. Which are just right and nothing too special. Last night, we decided to try some better entrees and an app. The corn tamales, were fantastic. Very sweet which rich corn flavor which was balanced with the citrus-y tomato and savory slices of avocado. Definitely something I'd order again. Since it was 4:30 my wife was able to get the lunch portion (offered before 5PM) of her Luau Salad. It was enormous! I can't imagine what the dinner portion looks like. It was crispy and delicious.   I ordered the Steak Diane. The steak was served to order and was tender and savory. The toppings weren't as exciting, I expected more flavorful mushrooms and onions. The meal was a bit more peppery than I expected but not in a bad way. The mashed potatoes were done well enough to pair well with the meal with the meal. I am not sure I'd order this entree again with a 19.95 price tag. The kids grilled cheese made me jealous. It was thick, gooey and quite tasty when my toddler insisted that I take a bite.

Now if I was a restaurateur and I had a wait every night I would make sure I had a few cocktail waitresses taking care of the people waiting since the bar was also packed.  In the hour I waited I probably would have ordered 3 drinks just to bear it while I just stood against the wall.  I fought to the bar to order our party of 4 drinks.  With a cocktail waitress they probably would have sold 10 and had customers having a better time during a painful wait.  We finally get our table and here comes my diner pet peeve.  A menu that is way too big.  How can you expect food to be fresh and prepared correctly when a chef has to cook 70 different dishes on the menu?  The food is no better than the other chain restaurants with the exception of........  Dessert. I would have given 2-1/2 stars if it wasn't for the dessert.  I do have a pet peeve here too though.  It seems that if it is slammed like when we are there there is a separate line for dessert and you have to get in it even from your table. We got our desserts to go and still had to wait 25 minutes because they were backed up.  Sorry and it may only be my opinion but if I just dropped $75 per person in you family restaurant I should be served before the guy who just walked in off the street (and I have been that guy in off the street a few times).  I should not have to wait souffle times for a slice of cheesecake.

The waitress literally comes back with my same exact plate 5 mins later- i think they either threw it in the oven for a few mins or just threw the steak only on a flat top but either way everything was still cold (plate was hot). I couldnt eat it, she just said sorry and boxed it for me. 100+ bucks later didn't even get  to eat dinner and still paid for it.

It was super crowded and very loud.  I had to shout so my date could hear me. The foyer was so busy with people waiting for tables it was hard to get in or out of the building.

288,John D.,"Newington, CT",2,93,71.0,1.0,2014-12-29,"Ordered chicken wings for appetizer along with a crab dip and Mac & Cheese balls. Ordered plane wings with no sauce, rub or anything else one can possibly think up to mess up the taste. Wings came out with some batter flower thing on it. I questioned it and apparently they make the wings, freeze them and when wings are ordered they fry them up again. Let me tell you 1 they taste like leftover and 2 they are leftovers. The crab dip had way too much mayo. Nothing worse than old worm mayo taste. Finally kids had the Mac and cheese balls. They tell me they really liked it. They look good too. I typically order steak with a bone in it. My favor it is a bone in ribeye. They don't have a steak here with a bone in it. Steaks on the bone just have a much better taste. I'm sorry but they should know that. They seem to take the cheep way out ordering poor quality beef.  Overall the only good thing we had was the Mac and cheese. I'm sure there are other items on the menu that are good. I've eaten here before when I wasn't watching my diet. I seem to remember good pasta. So if you want to have a carb fest. This may be the place for you. Overall this place tAkes corners and the quality of food is low. McDonald's version of fine dining I guess.

My family and I love the food here, but unfortunately the serve has been poor as of recently. Food: My daughter always orders from the skinnylicious menu. She either goes with the chopped salad or the vegetable salad. Last time we dined here, she ordered the chopped salad and politely asked for no meat in the salad because she is a vegetarian. But unfortunately, when she was halfway through the salad, she found a few pieces of ham or bacon mixd in... we couldn't really tell what it was. She wasn't mad and didn't send the food back, but it was disappointing to pick out the meat. Even if we did want to point this out to our waitress, she rarely approached the table and did not ask how our food was until we were already finished. I always order the turkey burger, which is great and I have no complaints about it. My husband orders the mushroom burger and also always enjoys it. Service: Unfortunately this is the reason I took away one star. You have to get very lucky to have an attentive server at this place. We don't get very lucky, and the past few times we have had a server she seems like she doesn't want to be there and rarely checks on our food. On top of that, she didn't even approach our table for a long time while we had been seated! I am usually not judgmental on small things like this, but this happens often. After we finally did place our order, it took a very long time for our food to come out. About 40-50 minutes, and we didn't even order appetizers. Another issue was my daughters salad was brought out at least 10 minutes before the other entrees. In reality, all entrees should be brought out at the same time! Decor: Of course this place looks beautiful inside with all the marble and mirrors. Never any complaints about the appearance! Overall, my family likes coming here for the pretty good food, but service has been poor lately.

The vanilla was superb and it was creamy. The vanilla combined with the chocolate was delightful. Cons: The chocolate was little to dry and it wasn't the best I tasted.

Once I realized my order was messed up I had to spend 45 minutes waiting for the manager who still didn't even get the order right once all was said and done. He admitted being embarrassed and ashamed of such a simple meal (tamale cakes, ago egg rolls, mac cheese, artichoke) had gotten so messed up and ultimately ruined.

To start it took our waitress about 20 minutes to come by and take our order causing us to miss happy hour, to which she shortly replied nothing I can do. Fine no biggie, I order a full price martini.  When she brings it, the glass is literally less than half full. I've never seen this at any restaurant, so I ask the waitress about it and she says they're all measured to be 1.25 ounces according to a standard recipe, not really worth $12, but whatever. We're sitting in the bar area and I see the bartender make about 50-60 drinks while we're there, all of them full to the brim and he didn't measure one single pour. Oh well. We move on to appetizers and the flatbread takes about 30 minutes to come out and it's burnt and half the normal size, I get them all the time, so two bites later we're done with that.   Then it takes another 40 minutes for the salad to arrive and when it does its all white iceberg lettuce, not the romaine it's supposed to be. I'm sure you can't get the freshest veggies in Connecticut in the winter but the salad was just fine at Chilis the night before. Oh plus the women's  bathroom was out of toilet paper and soap.

Now I look at it today and think...their relevance is about the same size as the amount of effort they put into their food.  LOOK AT THEIR MENU IF YOU HAVEN'T YET. Overwhelming. So many awesome sounding items on their menu, I mean the list goes onnn and onnn it's like the receipt you get after a large shopping haul at Costco. So long that you can wrap  it around your child like a mummy on Halloween. Items like chicken samosas that you are better off getting at a reliable Indian buffet or the Thai lettuce wraps that you can go to the Thai place for. I feel like the factory tries too hard to fulfill so many aspects of food on the menu that they forget about the importance of quality for each and every one of them because there are so many items! Less items/better quality or more items/less quality? That is the notion I am getting from a lot of other reviewers.  I ordered the fresh basil, tomato, cheese flatbread. This was only an appetizer but enough to fill me up. It was a good and safe choice. I was not about to order a fancy steak here as I was skeptical by the opinions of other customers.

179,Cin D E.,"Manhattan, NY",180,57,55.0,3.0,2015-06-20,"Wanted to grab some lunch after checking out the REI sale. Plus I've never been to any of The Cheesecake factories. So we decided to eat here. They had outdoor seating but we decided to eat indoors since the weather was a bit hot and humid and it seemed less packed. We asked for a booth so there was like a 15 minute wait. Wasn't a big deal. After we were seated we the waiter came by and took our order. I had the Skinny Margarita. It was okay. I've had better. I ordered the herb crusted filet of salmon. It came with mash and asparagus. I was a bit disappointed. I'd assumed herb crusted meant it was a lil crunchy when you bite into it. But I guess not. Plus, I'm not sure if it was fresh or perhaps defrosted when prepared, it tasted fishy and smelled a bit fishy. I wasn't really happy about that neither. We also ordered the Mac n Cheeseburger and french fries. The burger wasn't bad. It was cooked just right. The fries on the other hand were a bit too salty. The presentation of our dishes were nice. So of course I took a picture before tasting it. The service was really slow after we got our food. We wanted some ketchup since we ordered a burger and fries. Usually it comes with it or there would be a bottle of it on the table or the waiter would bring it out with your order or even ask if we wanted it or not. So we had to flag someone else down to get ketchup. I'm sure sometimes it may get busy servicing other patrons but it was a bit annoying. I wouldn't mind checking other Cheesecake Factories elsewhere but I probably won't come come back here.

My friend ordered the Chicken Shumai and I had the Shrimp Potstickers. Very delicious and affordable at $6.95 each.

170,Alexis S.,"State College, PA",0,1,,1.0,2015-07-01,"I don't really yelp all that often, but I just had such a terrible experience tonight that I needed someway to vent out my displeasure. First off, we ordered the crab cakes for an appetizer, as I am a pescatarian and do not eat meat. However, when we tried it, it was very off, as it tasted nothing like crab and was liquidy and cheesy. After having eaten two bites, my mother realized that there was bacon in it. They brought us the entirely wrong appetizer, and I ended up eating meat. Next, it took 50 minutes to receive our food, which was overcooked and under seasoned. On top of this, the shrimp we ordered was not cleaned properly and two out of the four pieces were full of poop. After talking to the manager, twice, she assured us that the appetizer and the shrimp would be free, and dessert would be on the house as well. So we ordered our cheesecake and waited for the check. When they brought it back, we were being charged for everything. Our waiter then went to talk to the manager for a third time, and when they brought back the check, they only took off the ""crab cakes"" and the shrimp, leaving all of the dessert and a $75 check. Tired and just wanting to go home, we payed the check and left as soon as possible. Overall, it was a two-hour long, horribly bad, overly expensive meal, and an experience I would not wish on anyone else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-hartford-2?start=120,2.92,3.09,3.09,2.724,3.022

I LOOOOOVE the Cheesecake Factory, and ask to go there every birthday. I try to convince my husband to go way more than that, though!  I always order the same entree: the bang bang chicken and shrimp. It. Is. To. Die. For. I never liked curry, have never been a huge indian food fan, but this dish is fantastic. It has apple slices in it which give it a little sweetness. You can order with white or brown rice, so if you are health conscious there is a choice for you!  We have tried the salmon rolls as an appetizer, amazing. Same for the pear and goat cheese flatbread. I tried their Georgia Peach cocktail and have started making it at home now.  The best? Their cheesecake. I love everything fall- related, so when they roll out their pumpkin cheesecake, I feel like twitching with happiness. My husband and I always joke around about a time shortly after we started dating, when we had visited this location and he had to use the bathroom: he gave me his credit card and told me to order whatever I wanted, and a slice of red velvet for him. Well, I ordered a whole pumpkin cheesecake for me, and one slice for him !!!  Joke ended up being on me as the cheesecake was frozen, but thats another story...  The service is wonderful, everyone is super friendly and knowledgeable about menu.

Once they sit you down you are handed their Ginormous Menu....damn...decisions decisions ugh!  Do yourself a favor go online and look at the menu beforehand.  Your server should also bring out a basket with fresh bread.  You'll get a couple pieces of french bread and some brown bread topped with a smattering of oatmeal...tasty and warm. Unless you are really hungry or have a big group of people you might want to skip ordering an appetizer.  But, if you do get one the Avocado Eggrolls are really good and they come with a really tasty tamarand-cashew dipping sauce.  The Thai Lettuce Wraps are really good also...I will sometimes get this as my entree.  They can be a little messy and you must like eating with your hands can't really knife and fork this dish. During lunch time you can get half sized portions but these are quite big also.  I really like the Luau Salad and the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad's.  The burgers are nice sized and flavorful you can get fries or a side salad with them if you want to pretend to be eating healthy. They retired my favorite cheesecake and saying I have a favorite cheesecake is kinda funny because I am not a lover of cheesecake's.

86,B G.,"Windsor Locks, CT",0,10,2.0,3.0,2015-08-01,My husband and I ate here last night. The food was decent but nothing out of this world amazing. The appetizer of Vietnamese spring rolls was not anything I would recommend. I had some at a farmer's market for $1.50 a roll that tasted the same instead of $11 for 3 rolls. My husband had the Jamaican blackpepper chicken and shrimp which was good. I had the spicy chicken chipotle pasta which was also good. The portion size is quite generous but for around $18 a plate it should be. The cheesecake was the best part. I had Chris's outrageous Cheesecake and hubby had the mango key lime cheesecake. Both were delicious.   Now the service was not good at all. Our waitress Genera (I'm not sure of the spelling) was too occupied speaking with the woman next to me. Apparently her name is Mallory and used to work there. Now multiple wait staff came over to sit or stand right there and chat for the entire time we were there. It's also rude to give your customer shitty looks. She did get a little better after I started talking shit to my husband about her attitude.  I assume Mallory said something. Best part was the end ans her trying to be sure and pouty saying thank you hoping for a good tip. Regardless we always tip well bc we have both been wait staff before.  We requested a booth but all were taken in the areas with wait staff. We sat in a long communal bench with tables and chairs on the other side. It was literally one long bench. It was like the movie theater when you have to quick decide ass or crotch to the next people just to get to and from the bench. I was nice and didn't glide my ass by Mallory's food and face so she got the crotch. I know so nice of me right? So this would have gotten another star but service and seating sucked. I'd go back for the cheesecake.

Eventually after almost 2 hours of waiting we were in pain from standing (one of my friends just ran the Hartford marathon) and starving. I had to go to the counter and basically yell to get attention. Both women at the counter told me it would be just a little longer and I said no its been 2 hours and finally a manager overheard and said ""just seat her now"". Luckily we had a great server but he was juggling a million tasks at once so it was clearly understaffed.

How about an 80 minute wait in a dining room the size of a skating rink? Luckily, our party of three scored a high-top table in the bar area and we were set for the night. I sure hope their drinks are reduced for Happy Hour, because our glass of Chardonnay ($8.95) and a rum and coke ($8.50) certainly weren't cheap. The opening bread basket  (light and dark loaves with butter) was terrific. The CF menu is absolutely gargantuan, but they get bonus points for offering a ton of calorie friendly choices on their separate ""Skinnylicious"" menu. Lots of veggies, little or no carbs, and the plates are less than 600 calories. We split a terrific appetizer -Thai Lettuce Wraps for $13.95. Six big Boston Lettuce leaves with grilled chicken Satay strips, cucumber slices, noodles, carrots, bean sprouts, and three yummy sauces -  Peanut, Sweet Red Chili and Tamarind-Cashew. It was a pretty big dish, easily fed the three of us and it seemed like a terrific value. We all ordered from the Skinnylicious menu. I ordered the Seared Tuna Tataki Salad for $18.50. It was advertised as having ""Fresh Ahi Lightly Seared and Served Rare with Avocado, Tomato and Mixed Greens. Tossed with Wasabi Vinaigrette."" It was four one inch squares of rare tuna, no avocado, 4 big tomato slices, and a lot of mixed greens. It was a pretty big plate of food for 600 calories, but understandably it was mostly lettuce and tomato and very little tuna. As I said, the avocado was AWOL. Service was OK -friendly but with no check-back on the food, and the dinner plates were brought out while we were still halfway through the appetizer. There was barely any room left on our high-top table with the three meals, bread basket, appetizer and glasses all over. It would have been nice to have timed the entrees delivery until after the appetizer was done, but I'll give them a pass because the CF was absolutely packed to the rafters. When we left around 6:30, the lobby was even crazier than when we walked in, as a huge line snaked all the way to the front door. I guess the CF is an OK place to dine after a day of strolling around Blue Back Square, but as a destination restaurant, I'm not really sure that the cattle-call atmosphere and pricing structure would give me a compelling reason to go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-hartford-2?start=20,3.36,3.13,3.13,2.8280000000000003,3.222

78,Jennifer D.,"Cranston, RI",82,60,160.0,2.0,2016-01-13,"Let me just start by saying that it is VERY rate for me to give such a low rating.  So, if I give one, it's because it deserved to be there. So after a long day of training that I had attended in CT for work, a few co-workers and I decided to venture out and grab a bite. One of the people we were with was Glucose free and Lactose sensitive. Due to that, our options were really limited for what was close by. We were able to settle on Cheesecake Factory figuring they would have a wide range of options to chose from. When we first walked in, I will mention that this location is HUGE compared to the Providence one. The decor was inviting with lots of Browns and oranges and fancy lighting.  Had a very clean appearance. We were settled into a booth (there were 4 of us) immediately, which during dinner time was pretty impressive. Although it was a Thursday evening so not sure if that had anything to do with it. Our waiter, unfortunately I cannot pronounce or even spell his name, was very friendly and attentive...... At first.  We ordered a round of cocktails and appetizers. They arrived fairly quickly. Again, very impressed. My appetizer was the Macaroni and Cheese balls. Sooooo flippin good! I really didn't want to share, but I did :0) Well, after placing our dinner order is where things started to fall apart. The co-worker with the restrictions asked our waiter questions about glucose free items and he had no idea. She actually had to suggest if he could ask someone. It took him about 15 minutes to return with an answer. They do offer a gluten free bread. Anyway, after we placed our dinner orders, we waited almost 40 minutes. We literally ordered some burgers. Nothing fancy and nothing that should have taken that long. I did notice the restaurant was a little busier than when we originally arrived and I started wondering if maybe they were short staffed. Either way, once our food arrived, one of the burgers was completely wrong! And we were missing an order of sweet potato fries. When he asked if we were all set, I asked him about the fries and he said ""they would be right out"" and I mentioned to him one of the burgers was wrong, however in his defense, my co-worker did not want to send it back even though he offered to take it. Back to my fries.... The fries that were coming right out, took about 20 minutes! Ummm something tells me the order was never put in to begin with.   I had ordered a mushroom burger which I have to say looked really, really good, but after biting into it, the excitement fell a little flat and the taste really left nothing to be desired. There was really no flavor to it. Everyone else agrees that the food was only ""okay.""  Once we were finished, we watched our waiter going back and forth and it took him about a half hour before acknowledging us. We were finished and ready to get our checks and go. We asked for some boxes along with the check. Yet again, another 20 or so minutes has passed us by. When he finally arrived, I waited patiently for an apology that never came. I understand being busy and overwhelmed and short staff, but at least acknowledge it with an apology. We could have complained about the many long wait periods we experienced and yet chose not too. We never asked about refills on our drinks or how we liked the foo. Unfortunately, if given the option, I would chose not to return there. There were several waitstaff just standing by the kitchen (we were seated pretty close to it) just chit chatting and gabbing away.  There wasn't even a manager around to check in and see how we were doing and the food did not make up for the terrible service.  Based on my and my co-workers experience I felt the 2 star rating is appropriate.

169,Ryan O.,"West Hartford, CT",3,16,6.0,3.0,2016-01-31,"Visited for lunch today.  Enjoyed the meal but experienced a slight table mix up.  To start we were brought to a table near the bar area.  Very well lit, in the middle of it all, a desirable location.  After about 15 minutes we were approached by the manager.  He informed us that we should not have been seated in that location as they were reserving a number of tables for a large group coming in.  He directed us to a different table.  The new spot was a booth by the kitchen and a cash register station.  Dark despite being mid day, not the best, slightly annoying.  I will say however that the manager was very professional about it and went as far as to comp us for our appetizer.  As the wait staff brought our drinks and food to the new location they forgot an item and I had to ask for it. Even further, when the bill arrived, the appetizer had not been removed, so I had to ask that it be adjusted as well.  I suppose it may not be the fault of the wait staff as they did not cause the original table mix up.  As always, extremely difficult to make a food selection based on the sheer size of the menu.  They seem to have anything and everything that you may want.  Decided to try the egg roll sampler.  Enjoyed all but the salmon egg roll.  Just a little too fishy for our liking.  Very pleased with the four different dressings/dipping sauces that came with the appetizer.  The lemonade was good and even contained a sugared rim, but it had such a sour taste to it that I needed to water it down.  We got the lunch size Pasta da Vinci and the Italian Turkey Sandwich.  Both portions were large enough that we couldn't even finish them there.  Enjoyed the food and the experience, while slightly annoying, was still quite enjoyable.  Certainly recommend visiting and we will be sure to return as well, as slight mix ups can always occur.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-hartford-2?start=120,3.28,3.1,3.1,2.7,3.1720000000000006

132,Marie B.,"West Hartford, CT",0,5,,3.0,2016-06-06,"I've been here several times. Typically on a Friday night and there is usually a 45-60 minute wait which is fine. The wait stuff is usually very good even though I know they are swamped and exhausted. I went one Sunday for brunch and was surprised to find how small the menu was for brunch items. I ordered a Creme Brulee french toast (I do not recommend - too sweet) and a mimosa which the waitress brought to the table and spilled everywhere. It was on my shoes, in my bag, all over my arm, on my lap and all over the table. The waitress just looked like she was having a bad morning so I felt bad, cleaned up the best I could and didn't say anything. The table next to us was complaining because 2 of the 3 people received their breakfast 30 minutes earlier and the one woman was still sitting there waiting to eat. It was weird the waitress (same waitress) didn't wait until everyone's food was ready to bring it all out together. What really bothered me was the waitress never once apologized to me. She asked if anything had spilled on me which clearly she could see I was covered in champagne but never once apologized. The manager also asked if anything had gotten on me and I said yes again but I cleaned it up and it was okay. I was a sticky mess but I didn't want that to ruin brunch with my friend or ruin the waitresses morning. It seemed as though I was more concerned for my waitress and her morning than she was for me... I did however expect for my drink to be comped or something without me having to complain or beg. That's just good business and good customer service. But nope, nothing. Then I went again last night on my birthday. We had about a 30 minute wait at 6:30 pm on a Sunday night. While waiting for our table a busboy carrying a chair dropped it on my foot and it hurt! A manager or hostess was standing right next to the busboy and they exchanged glances like ""oh crap"" and quickly vanished without an apology or anything. Again, I am not a complainer, I know it wasn't intentional but I can't believe the way these situations are handled. It's crazy! It's like there is all children working there. My waiter was excellent last night though. He explained my dinner was burnt by accident and they were making another plate for me and offered to comp a dessert or another appetizer for us.

13,Amanda D.,"Wethersfield, CT",1,16,11.0,1.0,2016-07-29,First off we waited about 20 min for our drinks. We arrived at 5pm before the dinner rush. We sat in the patio and it was not that busy yet. We had 2 children with us who's meals took very long to come out. We ordered  2 Thai lettuce and wraps for dinner and one came out with a giant hair across the top and the other came out with wilted brown lettuce. So after reordering we waited another 30 min for our food. This is my second time here this month and clearly this is becoming routing because the last visit was just as bad and food took forever but thought it was that one time clearly it wasn't. So it is now 7:25 pm and we are late for our movie. Not sure if the patio is short staffed or the kitchen but cheesecake is really falling off. But 2 hours and 25 min later with 2 5 year olds we are not happy with the experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-hartford-2?start=80,3.0,3.12,3.12,2.2760000000000002,3.0720000000000005

The appetizers took a half hour to come to the table and the food took well over an hour. To top things off all the meals were missing something and we all got our side dishes late. The waitress actually almost hit me in the face with a plate for the sides and when taking them away. And I'm not even a big guy just lack of skills. The manager did apologize and take things off the bill but the service was terrible my glass of water was almost always empty.

52,Elise D.,"Hartford, CT",6,114,48.0,2.0,2016-09-06,"We were here this past Monday for dinner. I have to say that I was not impressed with the service here. That seems to be a consistent problem for this restaurant, and shouldnt be at the prices they charge. After we were seated we were not greeted by our server for a good 15 minutes. Thats really not an acceptable wait time. We placed our orders for three entrees which took fifty five minutes to come out. Again, considering the restaurant was half empty, this seemed quite excessive.  We were seated right in the booth by the kitchen so we could hear screaming, yelling, breaking of dishes and slamming of things all throughout our meal and it was LOUD.. Either remind your chefs and wait staff that this is a restaurant and act accordinly or place a wall or something up so your guests dont have to hear yelling for the duration of their dinner. Its really not helping the ambiance of the restaurant. Our water glasses were not refilled for 1/2 an hour, our bevarages were not asked to be replenished either. We ordered dessert, waited twenty five minutes (which seems excessive for two slices of cheesecake doesnt it??) and then said we would have to take them to go since we were now late due to the service here. When we were walking out, we saw about 20 plated pieces of cheesecake which led me to believe they were being plated, the servers just werent bringing them out. We enjoyed our cheesecake in the car, on the way home, after finding forks which they somehow forgot to include in our to-go bag.(??) I like the decor and food at the Cheesecake Factory locations but the service is extremely lacking and I cant say that we would be returning to spend another $100 dinner at this noisy and slow establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-hartford-2?start=20,3.12,3.13,3.13,2.3440000000000003,3.126

I really did not expect this disastrous service by Cheesecake factory. It is understandable that you have a super busy night, but there is no excuse to a bad and slow customer service. Especially on a Monday night? Really? We were a group of 6 and ordered a long list of delicacies and ofcourse the ever famous cheese cake to end the supper.  1. Chicken samosa: if you have tried the original Indian version, this is a spoof of that. It is usually a good choice, but this time it was super salty. Needs improvement.  2. Nachos: delicious and authentic mexican. Even though I never visited mexico.  3. Tamale cakes: vegetarian appetizer option but really not worth if you don't like it sweet.  Main course: 1. Chicken bellagio : loved loved loved it !! Crispy chicken with noodles. Unique flavor. Must try.  Overall the food was good. But we had to pay a huge price for all this in terms of our valuable time. God knows how long we were kept waiting.  Drinks arrived after appetizers were gulped down the throat.  Dinner arrived when we were craving for the dessert.  Dessert arrived when we were ready to crash on our bed under the blanket. Nothing was in order.  Waiter apologized for the delay and promised that the dinner will super tasty and be served with extra love and care!! It was like a long boring movie. Management needs to take a step back and understand that there is a huge scope of improvement here.

With an extensive, multi-page menu you're bound to find something for everyone in your party. This location tends to be pretty crowded and the wait on the evenings and weekend can get upwards of an hour or more.  On this particular visit I tried the shrimp sandwich which was fine. I imagined it being similar to like a po boy, but it wasn't. The shrimp had a tempura like coating, very similar to the dynamite shrimp which is more asian, even though this sandwich marketed tartar, remoulade and chipotle mayo. Change the breading on the shrimp to be more of a southern style and you've got a winner. This version was just ok.  They serve bread to begin the meal and of course there's always the option of a wonderful dessert. My favorite is the carrot cake cheesecake but I didn't splurge on calories this time.

29,Tiffany F.,"Bristol, CT",1,11,1.0,2.0,2016-11-03,"It was fairly quiet early lunch time, which was a good thing, having read other reviews where the wait has been bad. The restaurant looks really nice and has an array of booths and individual tables to cater for different group sizes. The first difficulty was in trying to order an appetizer. Both myself and my partner are vegetarians, and we spied numerous items that looked suitable. However, our waitress pointed out that _any_ fried food is fried alongside the meat. Okay, so let's try the stuffed mushrooms with cheese? They're stuffed with crab meat - *Which it doesn't say on the menu*. Why not the spinach dip? The tortillas are fried the same way, so that rules out the quesadilla too. At this point we gave up with appetizers.  Drinks took quite some time to arrive, okay, one was a custom Bloody Mary order. The other was Guinness, in a can. Which the waitress just dumped on the table along with a glass. Call me odd, but when I'm served a drink from a can in a restaurant, I quite like it poured. Just for a touch of class. The Bloody Mary was also really bad. Onto the main course; which was one 4 cheese pasta dish, and one Evelyn's Favorite pasta - which was a sad, sad attempt at pesto topped with vegetables that couldn't save it. The 4 cheese was bland as anything; I'd have been saddened to get the end result with a 99c box of pasta and a jar of pasta sauce from the shelf of the grocery store. At this point the manager came out to apologise and refund us, which was a professional gesture at least. And he seemed genuinely apologetic. We didn't bother with dessert; which might have been really good as you'd hope a place with cheesecake in their name can deliver something outstanding. Worth pointing out, we 'dined' here on a gift card so it cost about as much as it was worth (imo) in the end, however in left a pretty bad taste in my mouth, and as for my partner? Well, she pretty much ate a few mouthfuls and was done with hers. The service was okay; our waitress was knowledgeable about what vegetarians couldn't eat on the menu, but this was unfortunately most of the items we were interested in.

I ended up throwing out the food because it all looked disgusting & not what we had ordered. I figured tonight I would give it another shot so I ordered avocado egg rolls which were brown I also ordered Asian chicken wraps and my lettuce was old my daughters chicken Piccata was cold not even warm very dry and bland. It seems like it was sitting in the window for long or it was an order that someone didn't take. I ordered a cheesecake that I paid for and they never gave me the cheesecake I got home and I wasn't going to go back for it. The dishes were similarly unsatisfactory.

I love artichokes overall but this is some of the best artichokes that I've ever had. Their appetizers are quite large but have a wide variety so that there is something for everyone. I was impressed with their Ahi Carpaccio, which looked like a flat plate of tuna but had some pickled ginger, cucumber and a soy sauce. With a wide variety of entrees, there's something for everyone. I really like their Herb Grilled Salmon, which has a significant amount of herbs and is served with mashed potatoes and a veggie side. I've also been impressed with the Shrimp Scampi and Steak Dianne. Their to-go process has much improved. I've tried doing to-go orders there before and have been on hold for over 20 minutes just waiting to order and then had to wait 15 minutes past the time that I was given.

The flavors are always right and you get what you pay for, in a GOOD way. The portion sizes are very good.  It's good for every occasion as well, dates, friendly gatherings, graduation meet and greets, whatever.

44,Alison D.,"Manchester, CT",9,19,14.0,3.0,2017-02-22,"We stopped by here on President's Day for lunch, our once a year trip to The Cheesecake Factory. The place was pretty busy because a lot of people had the day off like we did! We waited about 50 minutes for a table but once we were seated the service was very quick. Our server was very friendly and attentive. When our drinks were empty he came right over to ask if we wanted a refill.  We ordered mostly from there Skinnylicious Menu to save  some calories and room for a few bites of cheesecake!! We originally ordered the Ahi Tartare appetizer, however, our server came back to tell us they were out.  So we decided to start with the Fresh Basil Tomato and Cheese Flatbread and the Salmon Rolls. The flatbread was piping hot with fresh ingredients, our boys really enjoyed it.  My husband and I thought the Salmon Rolls were delicious, especially the Sweet Hot Chili Sauce but wished the portion size was a little larger. This appetizer would be good for 1 person but not 2 people sharing. On to our main entrées, one of our sons ordered the Cuban Sandwich. This was a large delicious sandwich(enough for a 2nd meal later that evening!) and the other had the Turkey Club. This was also a large portion with extra to take home for later. The only negative about the Turkey Club is that they use a lot of shredded lettuce instead of a lettuce leaf which would have been easier to eat. I had the Tuscan Chicken which had 3 thin sliced grilled chicken cutlets, fresh asparagus and tomatoes with artichokes and capers in a balsamic vinaigrette. The portion size again was large enough for a 2nd meal and very tasty for a low calorie entrée!! My husband ordered the Asian Style Chicken Lettuce Wrap Tacos. There were 3 ""tacos"" which were messy to eat but very tasty, he especially enjoyed the sauces that came with it. Now onto what they are most famous for the Cheesecake!!! We let our boys each order 1 piece of cheesecake, knowing that we would be able to sample it as well!! One ordered the Key Lime Cheesecake and the other one ordered the Oreo Dream Extreme, both were amazing!! The Key Lime was very tart and tangy while the Oreo Dream was chocolaty and decadent. All four of us enjoyed sharing them and even had enough to take home for the boys to finish later that night. Our family enjoys our once a year trip but wouldn't be able to visit regularly as the prices are to high.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-hartford-2?start=20,2.8,3.01,3.116,2.9880000000000004,2.9259999999999997

We sat at the bar for a little bit while we waited.  Service at the bar was excellent- fast and friendly and my drink was amazing (Mojito).   Once we were seated, we had kind of wished we stayed at the bar because the dining room gets pretty noisy but that is to be expected.  We had the egg roll sampler and the truffle grilled cheese sticks as an appetizer.  They were both wonderful, I recommend the egg roll sampler it is fantastic!  For dinner I had the Skinnylicious Steak Medallions and my husband had the combination platter of Steak Diane and Chicken Madeira.  Both of our steaks were cooked perfectly and we agreed that the food was worth the wait. Service was excellent! We had two servers, when we arrived our server was on her break and the gentleman covering for her was very prompt with our menus, drink orders, and taking our food order as well. Once our server returned he let us know and she was great too!

The pineapple upside down cake and the coconut chocolate.  Then the Dutch apple.  Now they have a new carrot cake which is not as good as the previous one I do love the variety of the menu.  You never get bored as you can have a burger, American or Asian to name a few.

250,SeongYoon C.,"Hartford, CT",50,82,114.0,3.0,2017-03-23,This was my first time back to Cheesecake Factory since high school. I didn't realize how many calories were in all their dishes so we ended up ordering our entrees off the skinnylicious menu and it was delicious! I had some concerns regarding flavor because it's a 'diet' menu but everything was delicious. We had the lemon garlic shrimp pasta and the Mexican tortilla salad. Both were delicious but skip the Mexican tortilla salad; it's just a salad you can get anywhere probably even cheaper elsewhere. But the lemon garlic shrimp pasta was super flavorful and just the right amount of food. I didn't feel overly full or felt like I just committed one of the seven deadly sins (gluttony). We even had some cheesecake for dessert and didn't feel like we just ate all our feelings. Will I be back? Yes. But this kind of reminds me of a more hip version of Olive Garden; it's your standard franchise.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-hartford-2,2.8,3.05,3.112,2.9560000000000004,2.9499999999999997
38,Brian B.,"Southington, CT",95,34,8.0,4.0,2017-04-14,"My wife and I went here the other day for lunch. The place was busy but we were seated right away by a friendly hostess. Our waitress Michelle came over promptly and greeted us with a smile. She took our beverage order and she told us that she will be bringing out our bread with it.  The menu is as huge as it is rumored to be. We ordered the Nachos as our appetizer. Get the Nachos! Make sure you get them to share because it would be a meal in and of itself for a normal person. My wife ordered the mushroom Swiss burger and opted for the side salad. I ordered the fish and chips. We had hardly got into our conversation between bites of cheesy Nachos and our meals were delivered.  My wife's burger was very large, juicy and delicious. She had to cut it in half to eat it. Not because she wanted to be neat and dainty about but because she had to! My fish and chips came in a large basket with wonderful big pieces of white fish and a bottom layer of fries.  We finished it off with the original cheesecake and Tiramisu to go. We both had to get to go containers for our leftovers, the portions were that generous.  If I had one complaint is was that the ""To Go"" containers were not large enough to take home all of my leftovers and I had to leave some fries in the basket.  The parking was easy enough in the parking garage. We didn't see any available on-street parking right away as we drove into Blue Back Square so we just went to the garage. The price of parking was reasonable and well worth the ease of obtaining a space.

My family of 7 decided to go to the Cheesecake Factory today to celebrate Easter and the overall experience was below average . The wait time to be serviced was extremely long...after being seated we waited at least a good 30 mins before our order was taken. My chicken sadly tasted like a burnt pancake and was supposed to be one of their best chicken dishes...sad.  the fried calamari wasn't fried long enough..it was extremely undercooked. The meatloaf was terrible. The meat looked processed and tasted just as bad. You're definitely better off cooking it yourself. The corn that came with the meatloaf was not properly cut off the cob and was extremely stringy. As far as appetizers go the guacamole and chips were delicious as well as the shrimp and chicken gumbo !!!!! The burgers and fries were also pretty good as well. I recommend ordering the shrimp angel hair pasta or tomato basil..you can never go wrong. Our server was nice but he wasn't very personal or engaging...didn't check on us or see if  we needed refills for our water. And of course the Cheesecake.....I had the snickers Cheesecake and for my first time tasting it...it was pretty good.

A quick look and the dining room was 95% full. Immediately after we were seated our waitress arrived and took our drink order and asked if this was our first visit. As we looked over the menu and it is a menu, we noted several new items. We ordered the chicken pot stickers and the sausage and ricotta flatbread. They were both excellent. I highly recommend the flat bread as it was delicious. For entrees we had clam chowder, the french country salad, the chicken, mango and avocado salad, and fettuccini alfredo with chicken. The kitchen was operating on all cylinders as each item was well plated and delicious. We all shared a taste of each others items and had positive comments for each.

I was excited to go within the first year of when they opened, then I went back again this week. I eat out, A LOT. So when I've only been somewhere twice in all those years, it's because the food was not memorable, nor were the drinks. The only thing memorable is those drink prices!  Anyway, we had a new waitress, which was fine, there's a learning curve so I'm not even complaining about any issues we had with service. It was about 9:30 on a Wednesday so it wasn't super busy or anything. I ordered the Thai Chicken Lettuce wraps. Two others at the table ordered the Chicken Lettuce Tacos from the Skinnilicious menu, and they were no more impressed with their bland meals than I was with mine. They also ordered Skinny Mojitos for $12 and both agreed they felt and tasted not a drop of alcohol in them! One woman ordered a glass of house red wine, which was $9.50! I only know the price of the wine because it landed on my check erroneously, again, no big deal, it was removed and I just paid for my $14.50 lettuce wraps. So, it was years between visits, and it will be years again. I assure you that like this time, if I ever make it back it will not be my decision to go here. There are WAY too many options of places to dine in WeHa than to spend my money here. I forgot to mention the big basket of bread we got. That was good!

259,Daryl P.,"Manchester, CT",437,124,215.0,3.0,2017-09-02,"Anyone that has been to this Cheesecake Factory in the heart of Blue Back Square is well aware of the long wait times it takes to get a table. Preferring to enjoy a happy hour here in the bar before the evening rush you'll find me enjoying a long island ice tea or a draft with a warm crab dip and the bread. It's a convenient location to come have a bite to eat before checking out the live music if you're inside or staying longer in the outdoor seating while taking in local artists and their music or people watching as they walk by. Not much of a scenic view but then again you are in the Square. You'll find your typical dishes here finishing off with cheesecake, go figure. They have their yearly cheesecake day celebration that you're better off grabbing your slice and eating elsewhere because waiting is what kills this place and with every night being a busy night service reflects that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-hartford-2,3.32,3.11,3.12,,3.194

They don't take reservations unless its for a large group. The menu is a book, literally. i would recommend looking over the menu before you head over just to get an idea. I've pretty much had everything from appetizers to full on dinner and desserts. The food has always been good, same with service, the servers are always on top of things . I've never had a problem. Let's talk about the building itself and the inside, I've gone so many times and im always so obsessed with the structure they've build its so beautiful, with tall ceilings and shiny shiny floor tiles.

Cheesecake is amazing, and the ambience is like a Grecian palace. But the food was AWFUL. Completely flavorless. I chose the carbonara and was told it's extra saucey. Mine came completely dry. I asked for some sauce for it and waited..... and waited.... Finally everyone was done eating and the waitress came by and said oh they never gave you sauce? Anyhow we got six pieces of cheesecake to go, one for each of us, got home and had five pieces of cheesecake. Pretty annoying. I would return purely for the cheesecake because it was so amazing (I got the lemon raspberry cheesecake omg yum) but will certainly never eat there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-hartford-2,3.16,3.11,3.116,,3.13

Last night we went with my boyfriend and his parents. There was a 45 minute wait so we went across the street to Barnes and nobles. The buzzer told us to come back only after about 20 minutes which made us super happy.  We sat down and started with drinks. I got the pineapple Moscow mule. So refreshing and delicious! My boyfriend had some pink lemonade thing which he said was good as well. We shared two appetizers; the fried zucchini and their new hot spicy nuggets. I usually always get the fried zucchini so it didn't disappoint. My boyfriend and his father said the nuggets were great, super spicy which is what they love. As for meals we all went with pasta. Our waitress was very kind when we all had some type of modification we wanted to make to our meals.  My boyfriend had the Cajun chicken pasta which he added sausage to. Such a large portion he saved half for leftovers. He said it was so good and it was just the right amount of spicy for our liking. I had the chicken Riesling which I swapped out for shrimp. The saucy was a light garlic butter cream sauce that was cooked with bacon, mushrooms, and caramelized onions. One of her best pastas I've had there! I would definitely order it again.  The in laws had pasta as well. Father had a shrimp and pasta with a tomato sauce which must have been good because he ate the whole thing! Mom had a vegetable pasta in a light pesto sauce which she also finished!! She said it was delightful.  We had such a nice night out with them. Our waitress was great, super friendly, and tentative.

240,Matt J.,"South Windsor, CT",265,216,71.0,4.0,2017-12-28,"I was a bit put off by the low reviews I've seen for the West Hartford location for The Cheesecake Factory so I thought twice about going here.  We had a gift card, so I thought there was little risk.  I'm not sure where the low reviews are coming from because I had an excellent dinner, night out and date with my wife. The wait is very long.  This is the case at every Cheesecake Factory, no matter where you go.  I was prepared for a long wait and was actually ok with it only being 60 minutes.  I never get out of the house without the kids and having any alone time with my wife was amazing.  The Cheesecake Factory is located in the heart of Blue Back Square so it was not hard to kill an hour shopping.   We got back in just enough time and had a good seat.  Though you are lined up one table after another, you are not stuck in someone else's conversation.  The menu is overwhelming.  If you have not been here, please be prepared for this.  It's also ok to ask the server for a recommendation, I do so frequently.  We stayed with old favorites on the menu. The atmosphere for some alone time was great.  Our server was attentive which is impressive with how busy she was.  Our meal was very good and desert was terrific too.  We had a good time out, alone, no kids and had a warm cozy meal.  I would go back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-hartford-2,3.12,3.08,3.112,,3.0960000000000005

I was seated in a section w/ Robert, first off when we were seated he did not come over and introduce himself I had to call someone over and he was directed towards us and even then he did not give us his name. After ordering drinks and apps I asked him if he would sing happy birthday to me at midnight he proceeded to say something which I did not hear my guests believes he said ""Hell No"" laughed and walked off, I'm not sure because I did not hear him. Sometime into the dinner I finally had to ask his name and he stated that it was Robert, one of my guests asked him on two different occasions during the dinner if he could sing happy birthday to me at midnight. When midnight came around our host was nowhere to found, I'm not sure if that's because they close at 1230 but he did not deliver. Finally he shows up my guest asked him if they did anything special for birthday and he's like yeah and made a face at her so my other guest whom asked him to sing happy birthday asked him what happened and it was just dismissed whole walking away. My guest asked another host if they could call a manager so she proceeded to get a manager whom got another manager to come over to our table, when he got there he did not seem interested in our compliant at all it was just like yeah okay well I'll see what I can do; no apologies, no offfer of anything. Just for the same waiter to come back and complain to me that he had a sundae ""supposedly"" ready for me at the bar. I said to him I know you have other tables to tend to but my guest asked you to do one task as our host to sing at 12 so he tells me actually you are my only table, so I wanted to know what's the problem? He stated that it doesn't work like that you wanted the check split up but I didn't ask for my check until you can over here rude and just straight out ignored our request. He said he wasn't going to argue w/ me and walked off. I've been a hostess off and on for 8 yrs and I took hospitality classes in college so I know what good service is supposed to be like, if he didn't want to be there they not my problem I came to bring in my birthday in my favorite and got horrible service. I will never be bowing this location ever again he just turnt me off from the whole Cheesecake Factory experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-hartford-2,2.96,3.02,3.1,,2.9960000000000004
