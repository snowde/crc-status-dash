My favorite is either any of the salads or chicken dish's washed down with their passion fruit ice tea. The service is usually very good unless it gets over crowded. This men's going early and skipping Friday nights. This year they added a ""Skinnydelicious"" menu. This compromises of low calorie choices. I also like the dark pumpernickel bread which is served hot. The ambiance is exceptional and thy spend lot's of money in providing a visual presentation. I notice some feel this is expensive, but I on't hare that view.

Of course, my local Cheesecake Factory is my favorite. I try to stop in once and while for their Happy Hour. Vietnamese Tacos & Lettuce Wraps are Yummy! Did I mention Happy Hour???? This means the drinks are $5 each.  Most days, Happy hour is over by the time I get home from work. That doesn't stop me from joining in for Cheesecake  factory dinner. Teriyaki Chicken is my favorite dish at this place. This dish comes with rice, grilled pineapple and bananas.  You can't come to this place without ordering a slice of Cheesecake. Let me tell you... the slice is huge and there is plenty to share. There's so many flavors I can't pick a favorite. Fresh banana, strawberry, Godiva chocolate, upside-down pineapple, chocolate mousse, and original are just some of the flavors I always order.

So a few weeks ago my daughter was due to be at the Kravitz for an awards ceremony, and it was her choice for dinner beforehand, so we found ourselves seated at what I can only describe as Chucky E Cheese(cake), minus the games! (Wait, we still had our server! ) And, the volume level was at 11! Next was the bench/ cafeteria table we were herded to that certainly warranted paying $100.00 for three people to dine......NOT! The service? Well, the low-lights were forgetting our drink orders, bringing out two entrees, and forgetting the third still had to be delivered, and her inability to retrieve a bottle of ketchup. The food? My wife's Burrito Grande was inedible, seasoned with something ""unusual"". My daughters pasta was way undercooked, I guess raw would be appropriate. My meatloaf sandwich was just plain embarrassing, both dry and tasteless, on burnt texas toast!

On Friday's & Saturdays they don't take reservations (I understand because frankly they don't need to, they always have a line & an extensive wait) so theres that. Now the only other negative is their drinks for I don't believe I've ever felt a buzz from a cocktail here. Other than that.... It's all good. Great for groups, old, young, children and indecisive people because the menu is literally pages long, there is something for everyone, prices are fair, and mostly all the food tastes good.

The food was divine and the sweet mint green tea was so yummy. Kristin J was very attentive to our needs and even went so far as helping us with a deli ma. We wanted to get some cheese cake to take home with us but were going to the movies and knew the cheese cake would not hold. We asked Kristin J what we could do to be able to enjoy the cheese cake after our movie at home. Kristin J left to see what we could do and came back with the solution- they will hold the cheese cakes in the bakery for us to pick up after the movie. I can honestly tell you my mother and I were speechless at the customer service we were being offered. This was the best experience that we have ever had at a restaurant and will be repeat customers.

Regardless, we ended up at this location at about 11:30pm Saturday night and it was a pleasant surprise that the full menu was available until 12:30am.  The server was a bit of a let down. Not personable, we only saw him to take the order, after the food came via someone else and for the bill at the end, which was a shame because I was wanting to order a glass of wine which never happened.  I ordered the Spicy Cashew Chicken. Firstly in my opinion it wasn't spicy, it had a zesty kick but only because of major overkill of onions and garlic. I think it should have been renamed ""Onion Chicken"", because the cashew was certainly not the star of the show, more like a element for crunchy texture. There was several times I bit into a full garlic clove which wasn't very pleasant. But overall the chicken made the dish edible and almost enjoyable.

And then she brings the check with a circle around what we should tip. Poor service etiquette. Then explains that this has been a policy for six months . The highest suggested dollar amount for gratuity $2.53 the amount we were going to leave $5 because she did give good service for simple dessert & coffee. What she failed mention our state stopped adding 18% gratuity to parties 6 or more. So management told them it was fine to circle receipts for parties 6 or more. Since it was just my husband. & I she should not have done this. So since I am incapable of tipping a based on great service, I guess $2.53 is what she earned. FYI restaurant servers have been doing this to African American & Latin customers for a years assuming that we don't know how to tip.... It's insulting . I have worked in the food industry, and have been going to restaurants since I was a kid and have always known how to tip for good service even prior to receipt telling me how much to tip. So please make sure your social etiquette is on point it makes the difference in a great night & a poor night . Thank you to the manager for speaking w/us. It didn't restore our happiness, but at least he took consideration that the system is flawed. Now they just need to teach their servers how to own their mistakes.

I've been there during the day, at night, and prime weekend times. Excellent job each time.  Our server April was superb both times she's waited on us. One thing about these people that review these places is they have no idea how hard it is to run a place like this.  Cheesecake factory executes wonderfully.  Most people on here have no clue and being as I am in the industry myself I can say what a great job this place does. Half the people reviewing are just bitter about their own lives.

And on top of that I asked for honey mustard with my sweet potato fries, I finished my burger first before Aliette even decided to check back on us. By this time my fries were cold and I had no honey mustard so I didn't even want them anymore. I finally asked to speak to her supervisor since her costumer service and the lack of respect the other employees had for us by slamming that gateway door had me over the roof. Kate (the manager) walks up to us and does not accommodate nor even offer anything for us to make us feel better about this horrible experience. To top it off Aliette charges us for our uneaten soups which she has control of when it comes to the time they arrive at our table since she's the one who has to prep and run them for her own tables but brought them after our entrees.

66,Brian R.,"Boca Raton, FL",900,1223,4090.0,3.0,2016-01-27,"Of the big chain eateries, Cheesecake Factories are distinguished by high quality food and chefs who are good culinary artists just shy of a standalone fine dining restaurant. They're big and raucous places, with menus that are broad so that there is something for everyone. I eat off their ""skinny"" menu where the calories are under 590. The problem is that really, most of their food should be no more than 800 calories. Much of what they serve is like a day-plus worth of food. In effect, they're like the upscale Burger King. You go to a place with the name ""Cheesecake"" in it, you expect a certain level of decadence, I suppose, but half the time the oversized menu even works against dessert lovers because you're too full to actually enjoy dessert, unless you came there just for that.  The skinny menu was a response to their gluttonous bill of fare, but the better response might be to join the movement of restaurants that are delivering high taste and even fairly rich foods, but in portions that are kinder to their patrons' waistlines and hearts.  They lose another star for their tip calculator, which suggests tips on the total, not the sub-total.

20,Adriana R.,"West Palm Beach, FL",103,49,291.0,4.0,2016-04-28,"While I have eaten at this Cheesecake Factory location numerous times, this review details my visit on Wednesday, April 27. I came here to eat a late lunch around 3:15 PM. Since the dinner rush had not hit yet, the building was largely empty - making for a quiet, peaceful environment. Rather than stick to what I know, as I usually do, I tried something different from the menu: a macaroni and cheese burger. I never understood why so many people make such a big deal about cheese - after this burger, I now understand. The fried macaroni and cheese ball on top of the patty was delicious, and so was the cheese sauce. I asked for sautéed white onion on the side, which paired well with the burger. The bun was toasted, and of course the portion size was large. I asked for my burger to be cooked medium well, but to me to tasted (and looked) well-done. Next time I'll ask for medium so that I get a juicer burger. In my experience, the great food at The Cheesecake Factory is always mirrored by great service. This time, however, the service wasn't so great. Our waiter almost seemed timid. He was very soft-spoken. He did not have a warm personality, however he was not cold either - he was more passive than anything. He didn't smile once. I was actually surprised that he was a waiter there, because I know The Cheesecake Factory can be pretty picky when it comes to their wait staff. Another small side note about our waiter: he was wearing very chunky jewelry: a large ring and a heavy silver men's bracelet. I never understood why companies always made a point to disallow employees from wearing jewelry on the job. After seeing our waiter approach the table and being immediately distracted by his jewelry, I now understand that rule. Seeing him in that kind of jewelry actually made him remind me of a Nigerian prince or something. Anyhow, I digress. While the service was not outstanding as it usually is when I visit The Cheesecake Factory, the new burger I tried was delicious - another item I can cross off of their very expansive menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-palm-beach?start=20,3.44,3.43,3.43,3.024,3.434

Our fried calamari arrived at the table and mind you it is before our bread basket.  Today's fried calamari was very disappointing, honestly the portion was a joke today (5 pieces of tentacles & 5 calamari ring pieces) now I did not bring this issue to the manager because I'm sure they have someone in the back who expedite the food before going out to the tables.  After half way eating our calamari finally our bread arrives, and it was cold and extremely hard. I brought the problem with the bread to our server and even showed her by hitting the hard bread on the table and it did not break at all.  I can't believe they served this to the customer, especially one with a 13 months old.  I order the ahí tartar and it was okay, the 4 pieces of fried wonton skin was disgusting. It was stale and old, which is probably from the day before that was refrigerated.  Ate one bite of the wonton and that was it.  Everything else was okay, not wonderful, just okay. One of our birthday girl ordered linguini Alfredo w/chicken ($3.50 extra) and only got 5 nugget size chicken on her pasta and it was crispy on one side, when she ate it it was chewy and hard. She did not finish her food. Now at the end we ordered 2 cheesecake and as we mention to the hostess before we sat that it was our twins girls birthday today, when the cheesecakes arrived there was no singing nor any special thing for our daughters. When I asked the server about it, she said no one mentioned anything about the girls birthday.  I'm disappointed, they came after the fact and from it being a surprise ended up being an embarrassing to the girls.  Very disappointed with our visit today, especially when we are there to celebrate our twin girls birthday. Food was disgusting, portion sucked, and the birthday song no where to be found.  As a regular customers I'm disappointed on how today.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-palm-beach?start=80,3.2,3.46,3.46,2.44,3.3560000000000008

We asked not to be seated there instead in a booth. We agreed on the wait for the booth which was 5-10 mins. Just to be brought to the same crowded area .  Finally we were given  a booth the waitress was not friendly . She seem very up in age which really should not matter if you love what your doing. I asked her for her name not able to hear it she said "" it does not matter we we're never going to be friends"" I just laugh for it all seem like a comedy club.

Also out of respect for the elderly I will not reveal the waitress name, but if she looks like grandma be prepared to wait extra time.

We were not sure why as there were plenty of open tables.  THAT should have been our first warning that this was not going to be a good experience! We were seated 10 mins later. The server came over to ask if we would like beverages. And we placed our order. 1 salad with chicken, 1 omelet and 1 chicken salad sandwich.  Nothing difficult or long cooking times.  We waited 20 mins for our meals. (Strike 2) THEN IT ALL WENT DOWN HILL FROM THERE.  The salad was missing the chicken.  We looked around for the server.  No sign of her. She finally made a pass by. We flagged her down and showed her the salad with the missing chicken. She said oh! Ok. Then went to take an order from another table. She came back 5 mins later with a bowl of cut up chicken.  She tossed the bowl on the table and walked away.  We asked the hostess for the manager.  That was another 5 minute wait.  Swatting at flies on our food kept us occupied until Kate arrived.  We explained about the long wait time and the missing chicken.  She offered my friends Mom a piece of cheesecake for her trouble. And asked what did we want from her? We asked to have the salad removed from the bill. Fine. Now we are ready to get the heck out of there. We waited for the server or the manager to come by to check in us. 10 mins later, no server and no manager. I went to the kitchen to ask for boxes for my sandwich. The server final come by. We ask for the check. She asked me to hand her the dirty dishes and then she will go get the check.  I was already irritated by the poor service and poor customer service from the manager. I told the server I didn't work there and I wasn't going to clear any dishes!  She went and got the check. She dropped the check on the table and said ""I'm not sure why but the manager took off the salad from the bill."" We left to do some shopping.  I came back to the restaurant (without my friends Mom) to let the manager know what an incredibly horrible experience we had on her watch.  I spoke to Kate and another manager but I didn't get her name.  Both thanked me for letting them know about all the problems we had.  I left still feeling as if the manager just didn't get the concept of good customer service!

I have only dined in at this particular location on two separate occasions, and it was sub-par at best.  The service is polite, yet not very knowledgeable and extremely slow.  More frequently, i order my Cheesecake Factory as a carry out, and what an abysmal experience it is every time.  Now, tonight, Oct 7, was the final straw. I called to place a ToGo order and was greeted with the typical rude & rushed phone answer only to be ""transferred to the bakery."" I literally sat on hold for 8 minutes with no response or an answer, at which point i decided enough was enough and went somewhere else to eat. This has happened NUMEROUS times before, as i mentioned earlier, I frequently order to go.  In the past i have been told 15-20 min for my food (typically 1 entree), only to arrive and end up waiting at least 45 minutes total every time.

126,Lady X.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,28,28.0,2.0,2016-10-08,"So Cheesecake Factory has long been a go-to favorite of mine for about 10-15 years (particularly Fort Lauderdale/Las Olas). It has stayed with me in recent years because Of the  refreshingly new menu items that are occasionally rolled in. Further, it was where I had my first date while dating my husband (Fort Lauderdale Las Olas), and where I got engaged (romantic re-creation of our first date). The manager played such a large roll in making the engagement successful, and even did a nice cheesecake plating for our engagement photos later on. On occasion when we're in the mood for cheesecake, we'd run out to CF for a slice to share. So clearly, it is near to my heart.  We came to this location for the first time a few weeks ago to celebrate my sister's birthday. I was surprised by all the new items on the menu (hadn't eaten there in a while) so it took us longer than usual to make a selection. I was taken aback by the fact that our waitress kept rushing us and was visibly annoyed by our indecisiveness. She wasn't even informed enough on the offerings to help us reach a quick decision. Anyway, my sister ordered the new Southern dish which was amazing. I had the chicken Marsala which was very flat. The chicken as clearly boiled and had no flavor, and the marsala sauce was bland. I love having this dish at weddings and know that it has the potential to be really yummy. Anyway, before my food arrived I asked the waitress for some asparagus and it came over 15 minutes later when I was done eating. When we got the bill, I was charged $7 for the asparagus which was grill burned and I wasn't able to eat it (I thought it was free like some other places!) Rather than waiting for the waitress to return I stopped an employee who I later discovered was the manager and asked him to find my waitress and ask her to remove the asparagus. He introduced himself as the manager (short hispanic guy, cant remember the name) and said that this was the only portion of asparagus they serve and he can provide me with another one but he will not remove it from the bill. I was Shocked!! A manager? Asparagus?! So when the waitress returned she came with the new asparagus! I told her I had no use for the asparagus because it originally arrived at the end of my meal and was charred. She knew it was the truth and said she would go back and ask the manager if she could remove it. It took her 20 minutes to get this approval. She then took back the asparagus, which Im guessing may make an appearance on someone else's plate the following day after sitting on the table being talked over and possibly spitted on. I was just very shocked by this highly classified process over asparagus which I could buy a bag of at Publix for half the price!!!! If she mentioned that the asparagus was an entire side costing $7 and not a 'small portion' as I requested, we wouldn't have had the issue to begin with.  Overall: CF is CF. Always loved it and that wont change solely from this experience.  They have little control over the food because its chain, so if its bad here, its likely bad everywhere. I, however, will never return to this lousy location managed by a lousy manager. I'll hold our cheesecake cravings until we get to Fort Lauderdale, or head to Boca where Junior's Cheesecake has finally opened at Mizner Park. So move the hell over CF.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-palm-beach?start=60,3.16,3.38,3.38,2.408,3.2920000000000007

Had the monte cristo for brunch - also pretty good (had no seasoning for some reason). My son had the kids pancakes.

We were seated quickly and everything started out fairly normal. We got out drinks and then placed our order with the waiter. When we placed the order, we asked what kind of fruit came in the fruit cup and the waiter replied ""apples, strawberries and blueberries."" I remember this specifically because those were my son's favorite fruits so it was perfect. About 10 minutes later our server came back and told us they were out of one of our two appetizers so we picked a different one. As we were waiting, we realized we hadn't received bread so as our waiter was heading to another table to drop some off, we asked to have some and he said, ""oh, this was meant for you...."" 20 minutes later - still no appetizers or food on the table, our waiter comes back and says they are out of our entree, so we picked another. It took a total of 45 minutes for us to get our appetizers and my son's food (we had requested to come with the appetizers.) We started eating and it was very apparent the food had been sitting in the kitchen for a while based on how hot the plate was and the film that had formed over the dipping sauces. We started focusing on feeding our son and noticed the fruit had nothing the waiter had mentioned, it had pineapples, a single grape and BLACK BEANS!!!!! There were black beans mixed into his fruit cup!!!! We called over a manager and explained what we'd experienced and showed him the beans and he said, ""the beans are right next to the fruit in the kitchen so that's probably what happened..""  We told the waiter to cancel our entrees because we'd been there so long and had already had such a bad experience- he cancelled the entrees and brought us our check.

I usually end up getting the steak tacos or the cajun chicken littles.  I'll say it again - there are so many choices that its hard just to pick one!  They literally hand you a book for a menu.

The employees are doing too many things at the same time instead of having a production line. In addition, instead of preparing the desserts for the customers eating at the restaurant in a separate area, they do it in the same place and that delays the process even more.

I was surprised to see the rating on Yelp but after dining at this particular Cheesecake factory I see why. The service is a problem and unlike other Cheesecake factories I've visited. To begin with the service was extremely slow. Usually you  get a basket of bread right away but we waited 15-20 min before the bread cake and the server showed up to take our order. It took so long for our meal to come out that it was cold once it arrived (cold fish is not very appetizing). The interesting thing was that waitstaff would gather in groups around the bar while customers were trying to flag someone down. It was chaos.

41,Katie C.,"Cambridge, MA",85,82,33.0,2.0,2017-12-29,"Someone else used the term ""chaos"" and I think that is the perfect term for the hostess stand. They were having all sorts of problems- couldn't work the computers, menus strewn all over the place, a line out the door, etc. We were a large party but had reservations. Yet we waited for 30 minutes and watched several other parties get seated before being seated ourselves, and only because I went back up to ask about the status. Apparently our table had been ready for a while and they had just forgotten about us.  Having worked as a hostess in the past, I understand how stressful of a job it can be. You have to coordinate the entire restaurant's seating arrangements while also balancing angry customers, servers, and management. But the least you can do is have a welcoming attitude. You're the first person a customer encounters. This hostess didn't smile once and she barely communicated with me. Her demeanor made me feel like I was a huge inconvenience, and that's the last thing a customer should feel when first arriving to a restaurant.  It's a shame the hostess stand was such a mess because it sets a horrible tone for the rest of the visit. Luckily, our actual dinner went smoothly. The quality of food was typical for the chain and the service was quick and friendly. But it would have been nice if someone had at least apologized for the wait. (I've been given free dessert for far less at our local Cambridge location without even complaining, and those types of unprompted gestures go a long way.) Management just doesn't seem to be on top of it here and I hope they can work out the kinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-palm-beach,3.0,3.01,3.01,,3.006

It took AT LEAST 20 minutes to receive our drinks and a basket of bread. (We had to keep reminding the waitress every time she walked by.)  We finally get our food after an hour and my food is cold. I was so hungry I ate it anyway for fear of waiting longer to reorder another dish. My friend's food order was completely wrong on the first try. The second try he found plastic in it! The manager came over to the table to apologize and then asked US what we'd like to do about it? There should be no asking what we would like. There was plastic in the food so comp the meal! It was like a poorly run circus in there. Moe's down the street would give you better service than this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-palm-beach,2.88,3.01,3.01,,2.9579999999999997
