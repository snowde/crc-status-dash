LOL Anyway, hubby got fish tacos which were amazing, would have preferred the fish to be a bit more seasoned.  The black beans were great.  I got a chicken club sandwich and a side salad.  Both were out of this world great!!!  Side salad is really big.  I took half of my sandwich home.  Baby got corn dogs, pretty good.... he really liked the diced fruit we ordered instead of fries. Got the kahlua cheesecake which was awesome!!!  Overall wasn't too pricey - I think we spent around $41 and that was a lot of food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westlake?start=100,3.088,3.088,3.088,3.088,3.088

We sat at the bar where we had a fantastic Mai Tai. I'm not usually one for fruity drinks like this, but it was perfectly made. To eat, we split two appetizers. One was the crab cakes off the ""lighter"" menu. They were very small, yet very good! I have to imagine they were on the lighter menu simply for their size. We also had the spinach dip, which we believe came off the lighter menu as well because it was extremely spinach-y. We had wanted to get the warm cheese and spinach dip, but I believe we got something different. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't what we were hoping for in a dip. I find that the menu is a bit overwhelming for all of the choices that they offer, but whatever they make, they deliver well, so they're obviously doing something right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westlake?start=120,2.604,2.604,2.604,2.604,2.604

There was a huge snowstorm, so we had almost no wait at all (which is a big difference from the usual packed entryway). Without all the people in the way, I was able to fully appreciate how lovely the inside of the restaurant is (reminds me of Disney World!). We were taken to a small table where one side was a chair and the other was a bench that spanned the entire length of the seating area. That's a little weird since you're basically sharing space with complete strangers, but it worked. Our server was extremely friendly and very attentive. The bread that they bring you to stay was warm and delicious as usual. I ordered the crispy buffalo chicken sandwich, which was cooked nicely. The meat was moist, and the buffalo sauce added just the right amount of heat. My only complaint was that the cheese could have been melted for a few seconds longer on top. My boyfriend ordered the ""chicken littles,"" and his plate came HEAPED with chicken... He now has lunch for today! After our entrees, we scanned the extensive dessert menus and couldn't come up with one option we both agreed on since the menu is so vast, so we ordered 2! I got the s'more cheesecake (since I have a new obsession with anything s'more themed) and it was incredible; the chocolate cheesecake with graham cracker crust and gooey marshmallow fluff tasted just like a campfire s'more fancied up. I brought half of it home so I could enjoy it a little longer! Bill ordered the warm apple crisp since he isn't the biggest cheesecake fan, and it came out warm and bubbly with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream topping it off.

So we saw he had other tables, so we waited (cause I was going to wait 1 more minute so that it would be an even 20 minutes at that point) while he helped his tables.  When he left, we thought, well now maybe we will get something to drink.  Then we saw him cleaning the tables.  I saw other people while waiting who did the bussing, not the servers.  So we all got up and left.  Then one in our party wanted to talk to a manager on our way out.  He happened to be at the hostess station we were passing.  He basically rolled his eyes at us with a smirk on his face.  Didn't even offer any platitudes or apologies (barely even looked at any of the four of us).  The restaurant was not that busy, not even half full.  Plus, they had plenty of people working there and walking around.

It clearly shows since all 3 times I have been to this establishment the food has been unappetizing and just pathetic. Chicken Marsala was raw with a bland and watery sauce, I had 3 different kinds of noodles on the dish, how I have no clue. Any meat is not prepared to specification. Servers getting tables mixed up constantly.  The issue is a massive menu, a massive kitchen, massive portions with a massive amount of employees just spells out a massive failure. Having a bible for a menu isn't appealing, it's just stupid. You sit there and spend 12 minutes going through everything and can barely see what you are reading if you choose to dine after dark. It hasn't failed yet in that each time I would find something different to try I would pretty much know something would be wrong with it.  That's another thing, the ""ambiance lighting"". I suspect the reason for being that dark is so you can't see how bad your food looks when it arrives, so when you eat your meal there really isn't anything to look at and question.  If anyone else is just the biggest fan of this chain, great, good for you. I'm not.

120,Belinda B.,"Brunswick, OH",0,1,,1.0,2014-09-21,"One of my favorite restaurants but such an honest disappointment. My friend and I had gone to Cheesecake Factory last evening and had a horrible experience.  - I used to be a receptionist for 5 years. I understand how frustrating it might be to have an overcrowding number of people by the front desk checking in.. With that being said, I had always given the clients/customers a friendly smile, an assurance on their wait until being served, and most importantly, TO MAKE SURE I WAS POLITE TO THE CUSTOMERS (even if I was going crazy inside my head, I had to make sure they would have a pleasant experience, so they would come back). Oh my goodness! Yesterday was a disaster! I arrived around 6:45 PM, I checked in the front, AFTER she asked ""next person in line?"" I had asked for a wait of two people.. (The woman at the front desk, was older, around her 50's, glasses and short hair.. accompanied by a male, in his 30's..) She completely IGNORED me, and asked the next person in line. Once the woman behind me had gone up to the desk, the hostess then had the nerve to ask me who was first in line.. Are you serious? You had asked me to come forward to help me, completely ignore me, ask another customer to approach up front, then ask who was first? Before either of us had the chance to speak, she quickly looked at the other woman and asked her if she was first.. Of course the woman said she was..? Shocked and disappointed, I waited until she was done helping the other woman. When she was done, I had told her I had been at the front desk first, before the other woman.. She replied, ""The wait for two people is about 40 minutes NOW."" (The reason why I put caps on ""now"" was because of the way she said it. She gave me attitude at the end.. I'm sorry.. but that is not how you treat customers. Honest. I had never received such a horrible experience.  ...Continuing on with my experience... I said, ""Okay"", we were handed a pager.. 1 HOUR AND 25 MINUTES LATER.. We were finally seated. The one thing I dont understand is that other parties of two who checked in AFTER US had been seated first. I was not the only one who was utterly angry, but another couple was also very disappointed, they had waited with us 5 minutes after we were checked in.. I know they dont have ""call ahead's"" on weekends due to how vastly busy they are but they seemed to get a lot of other people in front of us.. odd much?  After being seated, a server came, asked us for drinks/appetizers..  we ordered their spinach dip, which came out very watery..  my friend and I also had pasta, which was disappointingly undercooked.. Again, I repeat myself.. Horrible experience.. Even though I am a Cheesecake Factory fan, it's highly doubtful that I'll come back.. Believe all the raving bad views because it's absolutely true.. Please save your money and go to Brio across the way..

104,Fallon F.,"Cleveland, OH",31,62,33.0,2.0,2015-03-09,"I haven't eaten at a chain restaurant in quite some time- and now I remember why. First, I must say, I was only here because it was a friend's birthday lunch and it was her pick.  When we arrived, the restaurant was packed but we didn't mind waiting, so we put our name in and sat down. About two minutes later our party was called, which was perplexing since there were many many people waiting, all of which had arrived before we did. I'm not exactly sure how that happened, but we weren't about to complain about a shorter than expected wait time.  We were seated in a booth in the corner, and then we waited. After about 5 minutes of no one greeting us, some in my party started glancing around wondering where the server might be. Having working in the food industry throughout college, I reminded everyone that they were extremely busy and our server was probably doing the best he could. But after about 10 more minutes with not even an ""I'll be right with you"" I couldn't even justify what was taking so long. Finally our server did arrive, said nothing about the wait, and took our drink order. He was friendly and informative and did make some recommendations. A few of us ordered cocktails and we put in an appetizer because we were afraid of waiting again.  Alas, we waited again. Drinks took about 10 minutes. Bread took an additional 10. Then our server was back, and he was grumpy. He snapped at us, he was short, and he seemed genuinely irritated. When he brought us a drink refill, he didn't even hand it to the right person, he just slammed it down on the table. Maybe something happened at another table? I get it. But it was very uncomfortable.  Then out of nowhere, our entrees arrived! But where was the appetizer we had put in long before?? Apparently we weren't getting that. And our server never came back to check on is, so we were never able to bring it to his attention.  Our entrees are what you'd expect from a chain restaurant, generic, unoriginal, no excitement. The food is overpriced for what you actually receive, but again that's what you get when they need to hike up the prices to make a profit for their corporation.  Our bills were dropped off and I saw I was charged $10.50 for the watery, I think they forgot the alcohol mojito that I ordered. But what did I expect really?  Just an affirmation to why I forgo chains altogether.

Now about the service:  it was not very good.  We happened to be seated at a table very close to the waiter / waitress station which unfortunately for me, was all I could see.  The waitresses dancing, one waitress hitting the other on the butt, seven of them all standing around as if they had nothing to do - it just wasn't what I wanted my view to be inside of this beautiful, expansive space.  The Cheesecake Factory would be smart to create an area where the wait staff can stand out of the view of the customers.  Our waiter was not very good, and he didn't check on us often, and was not good at refilling our drinks.  He also left at one point and came back to our table smelling terribly of cigarette smoke - it was disgusting and to me, not appropriate.  I'm not sure if waiters taking smoke breaks while they are in the process of waiting on a table is common, but I can't remember having this experience previously.  We give the service two stars overall.

I was worried i'd ordered too much and wouldn't be able to finish it, but it was a pretty decent sized meal and i was able to scarf it all down. the sauces both were a mushroom wine sauce. delicious. the chicken came with asparagus which was cooked perfectly. the chicken itself was weirdly tender (very soft) but the taste was perfect. delicious. the steak was cooked just the way i asked but was a little on the salty side. nothing terrible and perfectly edible but that'd be my biggest complaint.  Danielle had Salmon w/ mashed potatoes and broccoli. her broccoli was almost raw and wasn't seasoned at all. this was disappointing to her (and would have been to me also). she also said her mashed potatoes tasted too salty. her fish, though, was very good according to her.  this visit was a nice night out with friends so all in all, a good time.  i don't know when we'll be back again. it's kinda pricey for a chain style restaurant and the wait times are ridiculous (we tried to reserve a table since we knew we had a larger than normal party, but were told they stop taking reservations after 2pm on Saturdays. why?). we're also not too keen on the seating which usually has you sitting about 3 inches from the next table. it'd be nice to have some privacy or elbow room. heaven forbid you have to get up to use the restroom. your rear end would probably graze the plates of the tables next to you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westlake?start=80,2.68,2.68,2.68,3.248,2.68

She filled drinks right away and even brought my friend fresh limes each time she topped up his drink without him asking for it.  For an appetizer we got the Avocado Eggrolls. They were delicious and I loved dipping them in the Tamarind-Cashew Dipping Sauce. The breading was light and they were packed full of avocado. There was of course the good warm bread and the waitress proactively offered to replenish it.   I tried the Stuffed Chicken Tortillas. The Tomatillo Sauce on top of them was quite flavorful. The portion was appropriate.  My friend got the Luau Salad. The chicken was thinly sliced. The special dressing was a great compliment - very fresh and light. The kitchen did forget the chicken initially, but our waitress was able to quickly rectify the situation.  Another friend ordered the Chicken Bellagio. The chicken was lightly breaded and the cream sauce was light and not overwhelming. The portion was big as the two chicken pieces are served on top pasta.

Honestly it was extremely bland and the only thing that kind of saved the meal was the side salad, which was pretty good.

The menu offers a variety of food which I always have a hard time deciding what to get. My favorites are the chicken piccata, Mac and cheese bite appetizers, fettuccine Alfredo and the pasta carbonara. The drinks are good too! Highly recommend a Georgia peach. Before you leave, you must get a slice of cheesecake even if you have to take it home. They're very delicious and offer such unique flavors.

9,Mary P.,"Cleveland, OH",14,1,,2.0,2017-01-24,"Dear cheesecake factory:  is this your best? We were celebrating with family over some great news and chose your establishment to enjoy creating this family memory.  Unfortunately,  it will be remembered as the memory from a place not to go. We arrived and checked in with our party of 7 just around 6 pm. We were told that all the beepers were dying and to return later to get one. We checked in every 15 min and finally got one. Then we were told to wait a while longer.  It was just past 9 when our dinner order was taken. Some of the table was able to order appetizers and other half  was only offered to order beverages.  The food finally arrived and was mediocre at best with 2 of our diners not liking the entre. It wasnt until the dinner plates were being cleared from the table that we had a opportunity  to express dissatisfaction with the food. We were offered to order something else but at this point everyone else was done with the meal and table cleared. Honestly, the 4 hour experience wasn't worth the wait or the insult of finding that parking ticket on our window after. Spending such a disappointing amount of time at your establishment.   Getting  slapped with a parking ticket was quite a surprise since we parked in your lot and went along  the ridiculousness  required to eat there. Clearly  spending our time and money at your establishment was a very bad idea. Memories taken that night include: the 2.5 hours plus for a table. The not so great food, unrecognized disatisfaction with 2 meals or checking back in a timely fashion to see, and lastly the 30 dollar ticket. I hope it's very clear to you we will never be back and we have taken the time to alert friends and family of things to expect should they still feel like throwing away time and money here. #Sorrynotsorry #disappointmentatthecheesecakefactory",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westlake?start=20,3.6,3.6,3.6,2.7280000000000006,3.6000000000000005

Not usually a big deal except it was the one advertised on the menu! Ordered the soup and only after 15 minutes after finishing the bread, it arrived. The tortilla soup was very good. But the slow refill made the soup spice linger a little longer. Food finally arrived after the table that sat after us received theirs. We got the Burrito Grande and the Chicken Belligio. The food made up for the wait.  We got the Snickers Cheesecake to go.

Once seated, initial beverage service was prompt. I would add that although polite and serving a large table, attention to detail needs to be improved as although I was specific that I would like a glass of water without lemon, you guessed it, it came with lemon. I passed my citrus wedge on to another glass and moved on. Taking orders seemed to take longer than expected - prob took 20 mins just to put out order in.  Food came out promptly. Quality was good, portions were large. We anticipated this and several at the table ordered to share. This worked  in our favor as all left without feeling overstuffed. Only 2 of the meals needed a doggy bag.  Overall the experience was probably as expected. Long wait, marginal service and oversized portions. A slice of cheese cake for $7.50/slice seems very much like a money grab.

Seating was plentiful throughout the restaurant. Ambiance was inviting and appearance was clean. Server was pleasant and offered advice when I had questions. At 6pm, the lights were dimmed and atmosphere became more intimate.  We both ordered spicy chicken sandwiches for our main course but started with the happy hour discounted nachos as an appetizer. Drinks were discounted (a dollar or two for draft beer). We soon found that our sandwiches, which were large and well prepared (if a bit light on sauce), were completely unnecessary. The nachos were significantly discounted, plentiful, decadent, and delicious! I highly recommend them. Chips must be fried on-site and have a unique, welcome taste to them. They aren't meant for anyone on a diet, as they're loaded with cheese and toppings. We had to pack up our sandwiches after taking a small taste only to check the flavor while still hot.

I arrived at 7, anticipating a short wait. The wait was quoted as 75-90 min. I only waited because this was a birthday choice. Waiting area was very crowded, busy with take-out, but then a party allowed their children to sit in the middle of the entrance/exit aisle - smh..... Sis approached hostess stand at 73 minuted point(hostess quoted time)and was told in a rather surly manner that tables were running on time as quoted and we would be a few more minutes. We were seated around the 90 minute mark - I didn't check quote time.  Server was very prompt, knowledgeable and friendly. He did a very good job and was rewarded well for his service.  The food is just awful. Deep fried Man & Cheese was cold in the center, crispy Cuban rolls were hot throughout and crisp on the outside but doughy. Crab & artichoke dip was very strong/fishy flavour.  Entrees were not much better. Bang Bang Shrimp & Chicken lacked any bang, lukewarm, Chicken Chile was OK.......Factory chopped salad looked as though it had been factory produced - rather than chopped, it looked masticated, almost crushed and runny. One party member had Eggplant parm with some unidentifiable spag type side(zucchini pasta???) that was cold, unsauced and a little congealed. We didn't complain about anything as we had already waited 1 1/2 hours to eat. Not worth an additional wait or the dreaded manager visit to the table. Cheesecakes were very good.

48,Ahmad H.,"Cleveland, OH",0,8,,1.0,2017-05-25,"Two days ago on Tuesday (5/23/17), I took my family to the Cheesecake Factory to celebrate my brother's birthday. Regretfully, we didn't have a celebration--instead, we had a disaster.  It was the most dreadful dining experience we've ever had and I am so upset that it had to happen on a loved one's birthday. We're a very patient and forgiving family with a combined 32 years in the hospitality industry, but your staff sucked every ounce of patience in us.  We arrived at 7:30 pm. It took 15 minutes for a server to acknowledge us after we were seated by the hostess. A server named Jessica S. finally appeared and took our drink orders (we were a party of 3). Our drinks arrived 5 minutes later. As we browsed the menu, she said she'd be back shortly to take our food orders. We decided no appetizers because the restaurant wasn't busy (it was a Tuesday night) and we didn't want to be too full for our main dishes. A basket of bread would've definitely sufficed for the meantime. She vanished without offering any bread, which is customary at Cheesecake Factory. All the tables surrounding ours were receiving fresh baskets of bread. A short while later, I heard Jessica ask the table DIRECTLY beside ours which was seated after us, ""Would you like some bread while your appetizers are being made?"" Sure enough, she served them bread.    Five minutes became 20 and still no bread and no Jessica, at least not at our table. She was busy providing undivided attention to her other tables. We eventually stopped her and asked for bread; she said a fresh batch was being made. She took our dinner orders and left;with empty glasses in front of her and no question if we wanted refills. I thought to myself, ""Will I have to be asking for every little thing the entire night? But she doesn't look like she's training or overwhelmed. She seems to be on top of things with everyone else."" I couldn't decipher what was going on. Carelessness? Selective service? At this point, it's 8:30. People who came after us were already eating their entrees, and some were even getting their checks. Jessica would skip our table and ask the others if there was anything they needed. I had to ask a different server walking by if we could get some bread and she happily obliged; yet again, we never got any. We sat there sipping what was left of our drinks, watching Jessica serve everyone else. If it wasn't for my family, I wanted to leave. They kept saying, ""What's going to be open around this time?""  Honestly, bar service elsewhere would've been more merciful for a birthday than this. I'm forgiving of wait times and honest forgetfulness from staff, but that night was straight up unforgivable. It's past 9 pm and still no entrees and no explanation. At least show some consideration and let us know what's happening in the kitchen. Short staffed? Backed up? I got up and went to the hostess stand and told her that I'd like to pay for the drinks and leave. She said she'd need to get the manager Sarah to honor my request. I explained to the Manager how negligent and horrible the service was, to which she was initially/seemingly apologetic. Sarah was shocked at what was happening and said verbatim, ""It's not even that busy tonight."" She asked if I'd be willing to have a seat and get some food in me while she tried her best to make the situation right. As soon as I walked back, our food mysteriously appeared on our table with a basket of bread. Sarah returned 5 minutes later as we were eating and asked if we wanted a couple slices of cheesecake to-go on the house. I was offended that that was her solution to the problem, and for a family who didn't want dessert. An entire table of cheesecake could not sweeten this awful experience. We paid the original bill of $70 and that's around the time Jessica would come to our table to ask about refills and such. It was too late. If that was your form of an apology, apology not accepted. You're sorry because you were told on. I've been a loyal patron of this Cheesecake Factory in Westlake for years. For God's sake, my family even hosts parties of 20-30 people during the holidays. But I was shown two nights ago that we are no longer wanted there. We were always kind and generous, but now I regret the time and money we wasted in the past. And the fact that the Manager never offered any resolution for a family who didn't want dessert made it worse. I'm sure that when this happens to other guests, better resolutions are made. However, I'm not quite sure what filter your location uses to gauge what kind of treatment a certain people gets over others. You may never share that information, because you can't, but the public will always know the difference and never feel welcomed again. From Michaud's in Strongsville to parties we've catered in Cleveland, I have never seen such poor service with blatant audacity. And no matter what kind of training your staff needs, I suggest you add kindness and fairness to your employee handbook.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westlake?start=40,3.24,3.15,3.15,,3.186

As I said, they have a regular lunch and dinner menu with many choices as well as a variety of drinks, teas, an open bar, and desserts.  The restaurant is large, roomy, casual, fun for the family or just a nice stop. Staff is pleasant and well trained. This place can also be so packed at certain times of the day or weekdays that you may have to wait, or walk. So, I would recommend selecting midday if you are at leisure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westlake,3.16,3.19,3.19,,3.178
4,Stevie T.,"Massillon, OH",83,2,,3.0,2017-10-07,"We got there after 7, they don't take reservations so we were expecting to wait. We waited for about 45 minutes and our buzzer went off to be seated. We walked over to wait to be seated and a group of 5 that got there after us was seated before us. Then we got drinks. My friends a Moscow Mule, which was I think around $10 and my other friend got a martini that was almost $12. The Moscow Mule did not taste like one, but still was good. The martini was okay. Then they got a Tequila Sunrise and an amaretto sour. Both drinks were way too strong and not made properly. I understand that this is not steakhouse and has cheap food or drinks, but if you're going to charge the corporate price, then the bartenders should know how to make drinks. We got appetizers: macaroni balls, baked potatoes bites and nachos. All were good. Then when we all received our entrées we were disappointed. Four cheese Penne pasta, fish tacos, and I think some type of shrimp scampi. Once again, the price should match the quality. I know we don't live in New England and have catch of the day, but the fish was too ""fishy"" so I assume it wasn't that fresh.  The cheesecake was spot on as always.  They were busy so I understand some things but they could step it up a little.  I've had much better experiences at other locations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westlake?start=20,3.2,3.19,3.19,,3.194
26,Tiffany S.,"Avon, OH",96,199,152.0,5.0,2017-10-09,"If you like to make sure there's something for everyone, you'll love the Cheesecake Factory. Their menu is practically the size of a small encyclopedia! Sooooooo many selections, everything is tasty and the portion sizes are ginormous. I usually order the crusted romano chicken w/pasta and made to order red sauce,  eat about 1/3 of it then pack up the rest for home so I have room for the banana cream pie cheesecake -- PHENOMENAL! The service is great, and the atmosphere is your typical CF- high ceilings, beautiful paintings, over-the-top lighting and marble table tops. Be prepared for a wait if you go on the weekend. We usually have one of our party go put in our name, while the rest of us do a little shopping :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westlake,3.24,3.2,3.2,,3.2160000000000006
24,Margaret F.,"Erie, PA",4,51,221.0,5.0,2017-10-29,Out of every chain restaurant this is probably the best. Definitely on the pricy side but worth it. But the food is always good and fresh.

30,Mark V.,"Lawrence Township, NJ",0,45,1.0,1.0,2017-11-12,By far the worst service I have ever received at a Cheesecake Factory. The wait staff rushed us and the kitchen staff was loud and very rude. We ended up leaving .  I contacted the chain but they had no interest in speaking with me.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westlake,3.16,3.17,3.17,,3.166
37,Christy H.,"North Olmsted, OH",0,8,2.0,1.0,2017-12-05,"My ABSOLUTE worst experience being here. I've came many times here and never waited THIS long for my main course to come out. I have been very patient with them and waited but by the time the pasta came out, I just honestly didn't have an appetite anymore because i waited so long for my food. The manager came by and apologized and offered us dessert but didn't fix our check even for curtesy of not enjoying or eating my main course. Disappointed at the management and how they want to resolve the situation. Now we know not to come back at that location. Very upset with my visit tonight.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westlake,3.0,3.14,3.14,,3.0840000000000005
23,Breanna L.,"Avon, OH",73,28,7.0,2.0,2017-12-23,"We love getting curbside from here. Probably do so once a week. Tonight we ordered steak and meatloaf..both the same price. The meatloaf had a ton of mashed potatoes and the steak probably had 1.5 Tablespoons of mashed potatoes spread out as thin as they could get it. I'm not sure the cooks reasoning behind this but it is absolutely absurd. Giving two stars because the taste of the food did not disappoint. However, do not order steak if you're looking for a portion for an adult..maybe a toddler would be happy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westlake,2.88,3.15,3.15,,3.042
21,John Z.,"Lakewood, OH",13,5,16.0,1.0,2017-12-24,"I bought three 10"" cheesecakes for Christmas Eve. After standing around for almost 30 minutes, the cheesecakes were mercifully extracted from the refrigerator-freezer and I made my escape. But not before paying $165 for 3 cheesecakes. BTW, that weren't busy...at all! I was told that they were still a bit frozen, but if I left them out for 2-3 hours, then they would be fine: ""ready to serve."" Not wanting to leave anything to chance, we waited SIX hours, and after SIX hours, the cheesecakes were STILL rock hard! Our children took their children home, the expensive dessert still intact. Perhaps we'll try to chisel some free at midnight. What a waste of $165.00!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westlake,2.88,3.12,3.12,,3.0240000000000005
20,Chris C.,"Columbus, OH",191,96,228.0,4.0,2017-12-27,"Christmas Eve and took my daughter out for lunch and some shopping at Crocker Park, ended up at Cheesecake Factory....No wait, but fairly crowded inside...When I visit any CF I always order the Thai Lettuce Wraps as a starter, basically it's chicken satay, with 8-10 pieces of bibb lettuce, accompanied with chopped cucumbers, shaved carrots, cilantro,   Thai noodles and 3 sauces (all 3 are excellent) - Thai Chili Sauce, Peanut Sauce and a Tamarind Sauce, trust me when you construct that 1st wrap  try 1 or all 3 on your creation - you won't be sorry.....Daughter and I enjoyed the wraps - they never disappoint....For our lunch I ordered a Fried Chicken sandwich on a Brioche Bun, with a side on Buffalo Sauce and Fries, my daughter order a Pasta Evelyn dish which is rigatoni pasta with pesto sauce, roasted red peppers, pine nuts, broccoli and shallots.....The sandwich came with lettuce and tomato and slice of pepper jack cheese and blue cheese dressing....definitely recommend it, big piece of chicken that was cooked perfectly accompanied by buffalo sauce and blue cheese (it's a winner)...My daughter's pasta looked good, she said it was too much for her so she boxed it up for later.....we both agreed that we would split a piece of cheesecake (duh), we order a lemon meringue cheesecake...presentation was pretty....cheesecake was a bit dry, but taste was good.....I like CF's, I usually get a good meal and walk away full and satisfied, the CF at Crocker Park fit the bill as my daughter and I enjoyed our Christmas Eve lunch....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westlake,2.88,3.11,3.11,,3.018
