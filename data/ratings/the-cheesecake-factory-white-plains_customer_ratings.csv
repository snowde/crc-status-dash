The wait is definitely worth it b/c of the food and quality of service from waiters/waitresses. Worth the wait and money in every way possible. This place never disappoints, the food/the whole menu looks delightful and what I ordered was just delicious, AAAA++++ on the chicken croquette.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-white-plains?start=140,3.72,3.72,3.72,3.024,3.7200000000000006
232,Aj B.,"Cortlandt Manor, NY",15,6,,4.0,2012-03-01,"The waiting times are going to be rather hit or miss when you come to this place. I came here with my girlfriend and two other friends on Valentine's Day, but of course it was sometime between 5 and 6 in the evening - not too late at night. I was prepared to wait a couple of hours - imagine our shock when we were told the wait was going to be 20 minutes, and imagine our bigger shock when our pager started ringing in less than 10.  Everything here is top notch; The appetizers, entrees, desserts. I have no idea why you'd complain about a menu being ""too big""; in my opinion, that means it satisfies a higher range of people. Everytime I've come here, I've always ordered the Chicken Piccata dish; this place gets it right every time and has set a new standard for that particular entree that no other place gets.  They always start you off with a complimentary bread basket; just judging from the bread alone, you know this place is going to be wonderful. My personal favorite appetizer here is the Avacado Eggrolls, but I've sampled their Artichoke and Fried Calamari as well; even such a common appetizer like fried calamari will surprise you when you get it from this place. However, their beer selection has a bit to be desired; when I asked for a Samuel Adams seasonal, the beer I got tasted almost like a slightly enhanced Budweiser. I'm familiar with the Sam Adams taste and that was not it! It wasn't enough of a deterrent to ruin my experience, but still. It's called the Cheesecake Factory for a reason; the selection for cheesecake at the end is just amazing, and they've never gotten them wrong, either. We haven't compared a regular slice to Junior's yet, but that's for the next time we're (definitely will be) returning to this place. =) And as a bonus, their bathrooms almost look like they're paved with gold.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-white-plains?start=220,3.76,3.76,3.76,3.056,3.76

Apparently, the plan is once you're seated, you're staying forever with nowhere to be later with nothing to do. Well, we did. (Had to get to a train to get to NYC; thanks to the service, forced to drive down.) Better: When we complained about the waitress to the manager, nothing down to make angry customers happy. Well, same to you, buddy; we know where we're never going back to. The drinks were great -- except for the price and lack of alcohol.

Last week I came here for lunch with my family and we ordered everything and their brother because we were all so hungry!  First we ordered cocktails, I got the blueberry mojito, sweet, with a little kick! My mom ordered the passion fruit mojito and her boyfriend ordered the mai tai. She sucked hers down quick, so my guess is that she liked it!  As for appetizers, we ordered the guacamole, spicy, but it was not spicy in the least! We also got the southwestern eggrolls and the these deep fried buffalo chicken things, concept was gross, but they were surprisingly delicious!   As for entrees, the 5 people in our party ordered different things, but I ordered the BBQ ranch burger and it was great. The waitress made sure it was cooked to my liking, but after all of those appetizers I could barely take a bite! We also ordered cheesecake to go. I highly recommend the red velvet! It's huuuuge though, takes me about 3 days to finish haha.  The food is average, hence the 3 stars, but this trip I probably would have given 4 stars just based on the service because with how busy the restaurant was, our waitress was still very attentive!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-white-plains?start=240,3.64,3.64,3.64,2.8280000000000003,3.6400000000000006

I have dined here dozens of times (and countless times at other branches of the chain across the country) , and am almost always delighted with my experience.  Many items on the appetizer menu are as good as you'd find in the highest-end restaurants anywhere (ahi tuna roll, faro salad, corn tamale cakes, beets with goat cheese, shrimp with corn grits).   The ingredients are obviously fresh and well prepared.  Salads are enormous and beautifully presented ( standouts include the Luau salad and chinese chicken salad).  Entrees are often quite good, but can be overly filling due to the over-the-top preparation, that pleases at first but leaves you stopping halfway through.  However, the new skinnylicious menu of low-cal items is a good solution, with low-cal, low-fat preparations.  Tuscan chicken, white bean chicken chili, chopped salad -all excellent.  The wait staff is uniformly well-trained, gracious and eager to please. I've found that almost any special request is accommodated.   This chain is a remarkable achievement - great food that's almost always well-executed, and at a very reasonable price.  HIghly recommended.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-white-plains?start=180,3.72,3.72,3.72,2.9320000000000004,3.7200000000000006

The decoration does not remind me of any bakery, dessert, or anything even slightly related to cheesecake. It looks more Mediterranean than anything else...That aside....   So many things to pick, none of which are all that healthy. There is certainly something for everyone. The avocado wraps are a great appetizer. I usually perform room temperature guacamole, but despite it being warm, it doesn't taste overly mushy and has a lot of flavor. It comes with a dipping sauce that gives it a slight sweet taste, which I loved.  I suggest you try the Skinnylicious Salmon and the unsweetened passion fruit ice tea with 2 pieces of lemon.  I have also tried the skinnylicious chicken Mexican taco appetizers which were delicious. They are wrapped in butternut lettuce which reduces the carb intake which is usually high because of the tortillas. The biggest flaw with this dish was that there was just a single, small piece of chicken among all of the salsa and cabbage. It could have been better with some chopped chicken...oh well...

265,Lisa R.,"Mamaroneck, NY",28,162,125.0,1.0,2013-01-07,"Ok so someone bought me a gift certificate here when they had heard that I had never been. I really had no desire to go because I just didn't. I was at the westchester mall and faced with the food court options which are bad I convinced my husband to walk over to cheesecake. We were with our two kids so I was happy to see so many kids there. The noise level is what I like when eating with my kids. Constant bustle so no one tables noise really sticks out.  We were seated quickly. We barely got settled And our waitress asked us to order. We should have told her we needed a minute but we were really starving so we chose quickly and hoped for food to come soon.  The wait begins.... My kids ordered apple juice. Our sodas come and no juice. Ten minutes later still no signs of our waitress. We grab a busboy and ask for the apple juices. Another ten minutes the waitress comes over with apple juices  and says "" we ran out of apple juice. Someone had to go to the store to get it!"" wow- so I felt bad that someone had to go next door  to whole foods.  So anyway our food comes out  like 20 more mins later. I was a little taken a back by it looking like Applebee's food. I had tacos- they were ok. My kids barely ate their food and they were starving and they are usually good eaters so that was a great waste of money- well a gift certificate. We glanced at the dessert menu - everyone was ordering the cheesecake.  We waited and waited no sign of waitress. I have young kids I need good service. I need people to wait on me and bring me food some what quickly. I need to get checked on. So ianlly my kids wouldn't sit still an longer. We got our coats on and I told my husband that I would find the waitress and have the check brought to him. I walked up and down the restaurant three times with no sign of my waitress. Finally I grabbed a waiter and begged him to please have my check sent to my car! I left. My husband comes out 15 minutes later and says she finally came and she had no check but she had soda refills!!!

The waitress said she didn't think my mashed potatoes could be changed from regular to garlic.

When I mentioned the appetizer hasn't arrived yet the server not the waitress offered to take our food back and put the plates under the warmer. We cancelled the appetizer. Our waitress tried to take away our plates before we were finished eating. We dined during a shift change and ended up with a waiter with a strong accident that also tried to take our plates. He also treated us like we were longtime friends. I do not want my waiter calling me 'mon' or talking to me as if we know each other. Especially if he is going to attempt to take my plate while I'm still chewing my food. We weren't there long, maybe an hour when we decided to leave, so it wasn't like we were sitting there for hours.

139,Jay S.,"Dallas, TX",114,230,440.0,1.0,2013-07-05,"Edit as of 7/30/14: The Cheesecake Factory has gone DOWN THE TOILET in the past year. What was once a staple of my life (see original review below) is now just a mockery of what it once was. To begin with, the service at the White Plains location has gone steadily downhill. At one time, there was a waitstaff of regulars who I looked forward to seeing, but now it's just a revolving door of disgruntled and overworked servers probably grumbling over how poor the tipping is. First the food. Then the prices. Once-oversized portions are now ordinary. The kid's pasta which used to provide enough pasta for my two kids to share and then have for lunch the next day now consists of about 30 pieces of penne -- barely enough for one hungry child. Kid's Chicken Fingers used to have seven or eight large pieces. Now, it's four to five small pieces that are mostly breading and gristle. Good luck finding any chicken in there these days! The Chicken Romano is now sliced so thin that the breading outweighs the nearly invisible chicken and I'm left eating a plate of grease and fried fat. The old standby -- Shrimp Scampi and Steak is completely pathetic. Gone are the fresh oversized jumbo shrimp and now you get three sad small shrimp that could have been plucked from the Chinese Buffet. And the steak medallions are closer to the size of quarters than the giant medallions one used to get. Dessert: Cheesecake slices that seem to have shrunk and gotten thinner during the past year. The strawberry shortcake went from awesome to Awww...s&^t. Finally, the prices: Despite lousy service, smaller portions and food that become barely edible, the prices at CF have continued to INCREASE in price. A family of four cannot eat here for less than $120 unless you skip dessert and stiff the waiters. This review is not culled from a single visit. It is based upon our last (and final) five visits from the year 2014 in which we have come on weekends, weeknights and weekday afternoons. There is simply NO EXCUSE for how such a restaurant has gone so far down hill so incredibly fast. When I suggested CF as our farewell dinner for my son going off to sleepaway camp, my wife balked and said, ""Really? It's been terrible the past few times."" I told her, ""Let's give it one more chance.""  And we did. And there you have it. ______ OLD REVIEW _____ The Cheesecake Factory is remarkable for its consistency. Sure, they've missed the mark a few times in my 500+ visits but I would say that 90% of the time, both the food and the service are excellent.  The White Plains location is conveniently located across from both the upscale Westchester Mall and the newly renovated Crowne Plaza hotel. Weather permitting, patrons have the option of sitting outdoors on a nice patio -- unfortunately, there's not much to look at other than traffic patterns. Prices are reasonable considering the large portions -- and kids meals are moderate priced and include a small drink. Service can vary but is usually quite good, with waiters frequently offering to refill empty glasses and provide additional bread on demand. In the unlikely event you get a bad seed, the management is quick to remedy problems here. Favorite choices include Chicken Romano, Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, and Chicken Costaletta. The crab bites and chicken tenders are great starters and the strawberry shortcake and Linda's fudgecake with a scoop of vanilla make excellent alternatives to cheesecake for dessert. For the value, you can't do much better in White Plains than this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-white-plains?start=140,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5960000000000005,3.0000000000000004

First, I'm a huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory, where I've never had a bad meal. I especially love all the variety on the Skinnylicious menu. The White Plains location leaves a lot to be desired though. Our waitress was real friendly and helpful, don't get me wrong, but in the end her extreme pushiness was a turn-off. Apparently, the kitchen ran out of the honey wheat bread during our meal, and she was wonderfully apologetic. I am training right now and staying away from gluten, so I was secretly happy because I love their honey wheat bread. We did not seem disappointed, nor did we ask for another round of the sourdough loaf. At the end of the meal, she said the kitchen was almost done with the honey wheat and if we'd just wait another five minutes she'd give us some to take home. I politely declined, but she kept insisting. We said no two more times and walked toward the exit. I stopped off in the bathroom, and when I came out, hubby was holding this large bag with two loaves of bread. What was meant as a kind gesture came of as very pushy and a desperate attempt to wow the customer. I get it. Bad economy. Stores, restaurants, and every other retail franchise is going above and beyond to impress the customer. It's annoying. I did not need this diet sabotage, and three No's should have been her cue to back off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-white-plains?start=240,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.8920000000000003,3.1200000000000006

The dinner service was not stellar just better than the lunch service. The price of cheesecake slices was a huge rip off for the size of the slice. As for the food itself, it was pretty nice for a chain restaurant. It was probably the best of the chain restaurants I have been to so far.

212,Adam L.,"Ronks, PA",9,44,2.0,1.0,2014-01-02,"I apologize in advance for individuals about to read this review, but I would highly HIGHLY advise it: Our experience and the White Plains Cheesecake Factory was single handedly the worst dining experience I have ever had in my extensive dining experience of restaurants of all sorts. All is true. -My girlfriend and I stopped by the Cheesecake Factory on our way to ny in a snow storm thinking it was a safe bet due to their brand consistency (or so we thought!) In a rare night of 7-10 inches of snow the restaurant was extremely empty and tables were vacant but none the less we were sat in the ""bar area"". This wasn't a big deal to me but I would much rather be seated in the main dining room. Next, our server made his way over , introduced himself and took our drink order. I asked specifically for sugar substitutes and he had forgotten them on two occasions, then finally brought them and apologized. Once a again not a huge deal to me.  His words after bringing the sugar subs was""freshly baked bread will be on it's way shortly.""  Sounds great to me except it didn't make it's way over until 15 minutes later after our appetizer was brought out and we had to ask for it. When the bread came out it was stale and hard as if it had been sitting for days in the kitchen. Once again I continued to be optimistic and think things would get better but I was so wrong  After our appetizer our entrees came. I ordered the Tuna Tataki Salad. Now, I get the salad nicely arranged looks delicious. Until I take a closer look. The Tuna is beyond purple , it was a completely unhealthy color. I go to touch it and see if there is an issue and it is covered in ice, it's absolutely frozen. I cut it and take a bite and my gf does as well and both agree the tuna was frozen solid. Now this is getting strange. Let's take a look at my gfs dish. She orders the shrimp scampi. Looks appetizing as well but then she goes to eat the shrimp and soon realizes that the shrimp had been cooked with the shell completely on! No jokes here , she was sitting there peeling her shrimp as if she was first preparing them herself. We called our server over who apologized and then said they are preparing a brand new salad for me. Great problem fixed right? Not at all! Manager comes over and tells me they are now OUT OF Tuna Tataki.  She brings me a menu and I decide on the Salmon Salad. After she is just standing their waiting for me, gives me no recommendation and even says""I'm not sure where the salad page of the menu is, they just rearranged this thing."" Mind you this was the FRONT END MGR at the CHEESECAKE FACTORY. She didn't know her own menu.  Now it doesn't even end there.  The Salmon Salad comes out just 5 minutes later and it is rock solid frozen just like the tuna. The asparagus is flimsy and looked as if it had just been picked, wasn't cooked to any degree or ""chilled"". Frustrated, I call the manager back over and she insists that the salmon is supposed to be ""chilled"". Now, I understand the meaning of chilled but it shouldn't be frozen and when I go to cut into it and take a bite I shouldn't have ice in my mouth and have my teeth feeling the freezing temperature of the fish which was exactly the case. She continues to argue with me over the meaning of the word chilled and I just decide I've had enough.   After the hardships I tell her I've had enough and that we are going to call it a night. She brought us the check and comp'd our entrees but did not try to make situation right, both her and our server acted as if they were ""fed up And done with us"" absolutely not on Cheesecake Factory level standards.  We will never be returning to this Cheesecake Factory. It was completely unfathomable to me how service could be this poor at a restaurant known for their brand consistency.  Our server couldn't wait for us to leave and avoided eye contact with me when he brought the check, shoved it in my face , I said thank you multiple times he never even turned his cheek for acknowledgement.  Enter at your own risk.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-white-plains?start=180,2.96,2.96,2.96,2.6600000000000006,2.96

I think I've only had 2 bad experiences over the many years I've been visiting this location.  The ridge hill location is only 10 minutes from me yet I happily drive the extra 15 minutes to white plains. I shouldn't have to beg for a waiter and remind people that I ordered something 45 minutes ago.  Last night we went for a birthday dinner and everyone had a good time. The fried macaroni cheese balls were awesome. We had Steak Diane which was excellent. Shrimp scampi pick cashew chicken 4 cheese pasta all of which was delightful.  My only complaint why I can't hand out the extra star is the drinks. It kills me that you pay $10 for these cocktails that have lil to no alcohol In them. It doesn't cost anything to make your customers happy by making the drinks even somewhat decent. 9 times out of 10 I have to complain and get into a mini argument with the waiter to get a decent drink. I don't expect it to be a bar.

Cheesecake Factory always draws a crowd.  Not sure why that is.  Maybe it's the massive food menu they have that has everything you can imagine.  Maybe it's the varieties of cheesecake you can get.  There typically is a wait to get a table.  This one was no exception.  We were there on a Friday night and we had to wait probably 15 minutes to get a table for 4.  I didn't think it was too bad of a wait. The food there is solid.  I had the pan seared salmon with angel hair pasta, sauteed mushrooms and spinach and lemon caper sauce.   I thought it was a very well prepared dish with plenty of balanced flavor. Sometimes lemon caper dished can get too acidic for me, but this one was good. We also had 2 different cheesecakes which I thought were their standard high quality cheesecakes that are rich creamy and sweet. So why the 2 stars? Bad service. We were seated at the booth.  A few minutes later someone zoomed by and gave us bread and butter.  Then, no waiter for over 10 minutes.  Finally, he shows up and takes our drink orders.  We had to restrain him to get him to take our full order at that point.  Then we waited 30+ minutes for our food.  In that period of time, the waiter showed up twice.  Once to drop off the drinks.  The other to tell us the food was coming soon and that was at the 25 minute mark. Hopefully this is an isolated case of a bad server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-white-plains?start=100,3.28,3.38,3.38,2.472,3.3400000000000003

Two of them were the wrong dish. They also brought the wrong drinks to our table too. It was weird. And when the manager came over, she brought us more drinks, but charged us for them and then added an extra a pasta onto the bill. It was a little ridiculous how bad the experience was.

Ok we can forgive the slow drinks but serving the kids last is bad form.   We try to make it up to the kids by ordering them ice cream for desert. We are then subjected to sitting at a table half full with dirty dishes (no one bothered to finish clearing  the table) and wait 15 minutes but no ice cream or service of any kind arrives.

I was so hongry that I just slathered it in sour cream and salsa and proceeded to eat. Pretty small portion for the price. I get more from Denny's for $2.  For my dinner, I ordered an Asian salad, which was HUGE and covered in unnecessary, dry rice noodles. Side note: I only had a few bites at dinner, because I was saving space for dessert, but today the salad was awful. It was drowneded (for emphasis) in dressing and today I wanted to throw up it was so gross! Soggy, sweet and thoroughly disgusting.  Did I mention the poor drownded toasted sesame seeds?! BLECH!!! My kids had the sliders and the Cuban sandwich. Side bar: their kids menu is 10 and under... Why?!  Everywhere else is 12. Back to my review...Both were excellent!!! I felt cheated. My girlfriend had a chicken with garlic noodles that made me feel cheated squared :'(  The trip was worth it for the cheap cheesecake, but sadly the snickers one was dry as well :'( without the whipped cream I would have been gagging :'(  Our server was terrific!

Forbidden fruit: I thought it would be fun and unique to have a birthday celebration here, and, oh boy, boy oh boy, was I sure as hell, heartbreakingly and aggravatingly, wrong.  First, they don't validate parking unless you stay fewer than 60 minutes, so rather than rewarding you for staying longer they actually penalize you for attempting to enjoy yourselves. Second, when we ordered a bottle of Champagne, our waitress plopped it on the table and said ""They didn't open this for me, I don't know how to open it, so you need to."" Third, when we ordered a second bottle of Champagne, she actually plopped it on the table and asked ""Can you show me how to open it?"" which completely interfered with our conversation and meal. Fourth, she brought my friend brown rice when he asked for white rice, and our waitress was nowhere to be found so that we could not even attempt to fix her mistake. Fifth, even though they were multiple reminders that we were here to celebrate a birthday, and although we ordered two desserts, neither of them so much as got a candle in them, let alone the fact that nobody sang Happy Birthday, which was done for two other tables in the restaurant, but for some reason, not for us.

I was fasinated the the ambiance and a grand menu the place offers but food was very sub par. First time we ordered Jamaican Shrimp and fish tacos. The Shrimps were ok but the fish tacos were very bland; no taste and no hint of salt. When we gave our feedback to the waiter he advised us to take it home and FIX it. Quite an advise I say. On the next visit we ordered Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. When the dish was served there were actually two small shrimps on my dish and quite a bit of chicken pieces. I was not expecting this cheap trick of saving money in a place like CCF where you pay premium than the local restaurants. The service was pathetic where they changed three servers on our table and no one had a clue what were our orders and priorities. They took 45 minutes to serve our first dish and drinks.

There was no room at the bar and no room anywhere to sit, so we were thankful it went quickly.  Our server was excellent. Very attentive and pleasant and her timing with each course was perfect. No wait for drinks and we were even getting items from the bar, which could potentially slow things down.  In addition to their regular menu, which is enormous, they have skinny menu, which also has tons of options. I was actually a little skeptical of what the quality of the food would, since the menu was so large. I ordered the skinny salmon, which came with steamed carrots, string beans and asparagus. Everything was cooked to perfection! The skinny mojito was EXCELLENT! The other people in my party also enjoyed their appetizers and entrees. Portion sizes are large and there were leftovers to bring home.  Desserts are large enough to share and very good. I was happy to see the desserts and coffee come out at the same time.

64,David S.,"Garfield, NJ",68,113,32.0,3.0,2016-05-24,"Alright, so it's been a couple of years since I visited a Cheesecake Factory so I thought I would review this chain as my perspective has changed this time around. This will be a review of the chain as well as this location.  Alright, so we got there and they told us it would be a 15 min wait and they would call our name. In the White Plains location, they do not carry those buzzers other locations give to let you know that they are ready to take you in, so you must be on premise for them to call you. I don't even think it took 15 minutes to call us (party of five) so that was good. We were given a choice of indoors vs outdoors and we chose indoors. Outdoors looked nice, as we sat in a booth to a window that faced the outdoor seating area.  The food was pretty good - I got the chicken and shrimp gumbo with brown rice. Our cheesecake selections (banana cream, mango key lime, and original cheesecake) were divine! We ordered the porkchop and that tasted great. We ordered the Jamaican pepper shrimp n chicken and we did like it. We also ordered the salmon and potatoes and we loved it- very buttery. We also ordered the grilled chicken sandwich with a side salad...  And here is where I segway to the cons of our experience. So we ordered the grilled chicken sandwich with the side salad and ended up with a fried chicken sandwich with french fries! Lol I mean we ended up not saying anything about it because we sort of forgot! Luckily the sandwich was tasty and filling! Lol A couple of the utensils were not their cleanest and the pork chop didn't come with a steak knife. You try cutting a two inch thick porkchop with a dull butter knife and let me know how you fare. The bread was not unlimited prior to ordering our entrees like it used to be. They have this CakePay app, but the server does not market it at all! We could have saved our time with the checkout had anyone explained how to use the app.  Finally, we get to the menu. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of things on that menu that taste pretty good but it seems as though about 85-90% of that menu had at least one of the four following items - chicken, shrimp, pasta and spiciness. I didn't notice too much in other kinds of seafood (clams, mussels, lobster, multiple kinds of fish, etc.) nor did I notice much in beef. I ended up having a pretty hard time to make up my mind. If the dinner menu was as diverse as the cheesecake menu, then they would be onto something really grand. But that's just my perspective.  So to wrap things up, Cheesecake Factory is one of the better chains out there in terms of quality of food. However, between the somewhat false perception of variety in their menu coupled with some minor issues experienced in this location, it brings my rating down a bit. I don't think I will return to the chain for a long time unless it's for dessert or if I am really in the mood of a specific dish type that they have.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-white-plains?start=60,3.68,3.2,3.2,2.444,3.392000000000001

The bang bang chicken and shrimp was seasoned well with spices and the pasta still had a bite, the way I like my pasta. The different colors added to the aesthetic of the plate. My friend said the fish and chips were not oily. However, the fish lacked the proper moistness and a little more seasoning. The Oreo cheesecake was absolutely divine.

The entrees finally arrive and one was wrong. 2 of us ordered Miso Salmon with white rice. I told my friend to take it and Waited for  the other back to be corrected. The waitress arrives and makes me feel like a criminal for her mistake. We had said we both ordered the same! I cannot digest brown rice so it's not an option. The Manager then comes over and makes a big deal about what is this about no brown rice? I said I never ordered it. I can't eat it and this is really horrendous service and behavior. She then tells me they are out of white rice and it will take 20 min to cook. I then cancel my entree but they all convince me to order and I order a chicken dish that my friend had. You'd think I was down town at Police Headquarters. So order goes in waitress finally showing up and offers me a salad .. That's nice, but I told her I can't have a salad for same reason I can't have brown rice!! I'm recently out of hospital for gastric surgery and can't have that much roughage!! So dinner arrives my friends are long finished and we order cheesecake to go. They comped me Cheesecake but made me and my friends feel awful for their mistake. There was no apology, no acknowledgement of a mistake and absolutely no service until a major error occurred. All four of us and our families will not return. We can easily go up Ridge Hill if we want a Cheesecake fix and believe me we have plenty of other choices where we may spend our money. How totally insulting and never never again. Who trained them?

43,E K.,"San Diego, CA",6,85,35.0,3.0,2016-09-20,"My husband loves this place and every so often I agree to eat here with him. It's really not terrible, but not my favorite restaurant by any means. First, I believe it is Cheesecake Factory policy that at least 70% of the tables have large families with 2-4 young children. Honestly, I have never seen so many kids in a restaurant and it's like this every time. This makes for a noisy meal. The food is not bad. I always order from the ""skinny"" menu because I have a silly rule that a single meal should contain fewer than 1300 calories. I know this isn't a place for the dieter, but come on--the caloric value on these meals is suitable for nothing less than bears preparing for hibernation! This brings me to their famous dessert: the cheesecake. The one time I actually ordered a slice it arrived totally covered in whipped cream. For some, this is a fantastic surprise. I don't like whipped cream, so for me It was upsetting. When I scrapped it off the top I couldn't help but also take off the topping I was looking forward to enjoying. You live and you learn. If you want to drink (I know I need to the moment I see all those kids) I suggest beer or wine. The margarita I ordered was no bueno.

I didn't really care for the drink one bit, I mean it gave me a little buzz but it tasted like I was slurping pure mint leaves which is a no and you could barely taste the pineapple. The only reason I gave this four stars is because of the orange chicken. It tasted like I took a bite out of heaven.

Ridiculous! Then we find out that the waiter was sitting on an empty table chatting on this phone. WTF! Like seriously? is this how you run a business? Then I see him chatting with the other waiters.

My friend and I arrived at 3:30 on a Sunday afternoon -- well after the brunch crowd, well before the dinner cowd. Yet we had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. When we were seated, the place wasn't crowded, meaning there were plently of empty tables around us. It took another 10 minutes for our server to take our order. She had just cleared a nearby table so her hands were full of empty dishes, so she tried to commit what we said to memory, asked each of us to repeat ourselves. Did I mention there were only 2 of us? And we ordered 1 appetizer to share and 2 entrees- that's 3 dishes to remember.  After 25 minutes, all 3 dishes arrived at once. Yes, the appetizer along with our entrees, even though she specifically asked if the app should come first and we said yes. In the 25 minutes of our wait, we witnessed the table next to us got the wrong check. During the meal, our water glasses were never refilled, and we never saw the server. She finally noticed we were done, cleared the table, and I had to ask for water. She asked if we wanted to see the dessert menu, we said yes. Another 10 minutes go by. We see lots of other wait staff just chatting with each other - at least 2 groups of 3 within my sight. And of course, *our* server was nowhere to be seen. But when she finally reappears, it's with our check, at which time I reminded her that we would like dessert. To top this all off, when we tried to have our parking validated, we were told that it's only if we'd been here under an hour.

About 20 minutes after ordering I was told that they didn't have my selection but the other meals were ready. Since I replaced my choice with steak tacos and a side salad, I was asked if we wanted the other 3 meals (two of them kid meals) to come out with the salad which I said yes. So another ten minutes later my salad was brought by our server, but nothing else. The manager came back another 5-10 min later surprised that we didn't have the other 3 orders. Another 5 min and the husband got his food....and we were told that they thought someone else got the kids'. Finally the rest came after another 5 min and my son began to tear up because his bow tie pasta was penne instead. The manager was nice enough to replace it and when he asked if he could have both so he could start eating she agreed which was nice. I was a little annoyed that the server or manager didn't offer to take something off the bill but I guess they felt we were square with the extra helping of pasta and I'm not very assertive with that kind of thing.

13,Liana L.,"Valhalla, NY",363,566,1512.0,4.0,2017-03-27,"For whatever reason, my friends at school traditionally go to the Cheesecake Factory to celebrate their birthdays; I guess it's one of the only places that can seat large parties (we had 30 people at the last one) and has affordable options that everyone likes. Also their bread is bomb. :)  Portions are huge (my entrée always ends up being 3 meals for me), the food is consistent, the service is good and there's bright lighting outside for a nice group photo. I learned on my last visit that the usual dim lighting only starts around 7pm, so if you want nice photos in the restaurant, go for lunch or an early dinner!  They're really great about accommodating reservations, though there was one time when we had a party in the 20s around 7-8pm and we had to wait an hour. :( In general, whenever I go there in a giant group, it takes at least 3 hours ... so the food doesn't come that fast for large parties, but it's probably okay in smaller groups. If your reservation is pretty early, though, you'll probably get seated in a timely manner. It's been fine the other times.  I always get the Jamaican black pepper shrimp with rice, pineapple and plantains - the flavors are amazing. The spiciness level varies, but the spicier the better :) I highly recommend this and I can't even make myself try anything else because I always want this. The brown bread is super good, and they always bring us warm, fresh bread (and again when we request more). The avocado egg rolls appetizer is also phenomenal. They sing happy birthday and include a dessert for birthdays.  Overall, I do really enjoy the Cheesecake Factory; I'm only docking a star for the hour+ wait when we had a reservation because that was really annoying - it's rough enough to block out 3+ hours for dinner without adding an extra hour for waiting. :( I recommend CF for smaller groups, but it totally is a solid option for large ones too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-white-plains,2.32,2.9,2.9,2.6079999999999997,2.668

Apparently, she was unaware that customers sitting at an empty table need food.  We asked her where our food was and she mumbled something and walked away.  After more time passed and still no food, I got up to speak to the manager, who couldn't have cared less that we had been kept waiting for food for over a half hour. He never said he would try to get us our food and never apologized for the unreasonable delay.  We waited several more minutes, but after waiting 45 minutes and never receiving our orders, we left.  We were hungry when we arrived, starving and disappointed when we left, but could not tolerate being treated so poorly.  We had no idea if or when we would ever receive any food.    We have been to the Cheesecake Factory at various locations and never waited very long for the food, especially for the starter salad.  There was obviously some sort of problem, or several problems at this White Plains location.  The manager does not belong in the job and has no idea how to treat or speak to customers or how to run a restaurant properly.  My friend and I both got a weird feeling from the server, who never said hello and never introduced herself.  She never came over to check on our table after we ordered.  She never even noticed that we had never been served any food, and was rude and strange when we stopped her to ask her where our food was.  Clearly, the incompetent, rude manager hires incompetent, rude servers.  This was one of the worst experiences that my friend and I have had in any restaurant.

And sure they were- speedy and waiting for me at their counter.  My Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake at home later that night, looked decadent. Taste? Lacked a real cocoa punch for me. Insignificant to many, I take chocolate anything- serious. On the other hand, The Man's Lemoncello Cake, was very nice and refreshing.  For $17 and change for both, my Chocolate Cheesecake wasn't all that. And feel their cheesecakes in general- are overpriced. At that moment, I just wished White Plains had a Junior's. A slice of Junior's Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake, begs me to have another- primarily because, it's that freaking good and cocoaey.  I personally feel that for the $8 and change that I paid, Junior's tops, Cheesecake Factory's 'Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake' in taste and price- ANYTIME.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-white-plains,2.52,2.72,3.044,,2.64
17,Rich C.,"Narberth, PA",0,4,,2.0,2017-09-15,"Started with bad smell that thankfully was not in the dining area. Then not greeted at the table for seven minutes. After that, things got better. The San Pellegrino, while pricey, was served promptly and at a very palatable and refreshing temperature: 42 degrees. DO NOT forget to get your dressings on the side. They must use a half cup in each salad. Salads reviewed today: 1.  House:   The house side salad was a small bowl of mescalin greens. The proposed dressing might have helped, but it was bland and uninteresting. The greens had been pretty abused, bruised and battered, but were fresh and dry. No wet or rotting bits. The side salad gets three stars.  2.  Fresh kale:  the kale was fresh and odor free. No small feat. And dry. Good flavor balance between the raisins, Marcona almonds and scallions, but the real winner was the celery leaves. Brilliant, simple and delicious. The salad needs citrus, so a small spritz of lemon did the trick. In fact, there were some Granny Smith apple bits in there that, had they been dressed in lemon, would have made the combination much improved. The dressing is not reviewed. Three and 1/2 stars for the kale salad.   The hamburger was served on a brioche style roll. It was fresh, toasted on the correct side and delicious. The lettuce on the burger was badly torn pieces of iceberg lettuce that had to be removed and replaced with mescalin. The tomato slice was and end. The burger was ordered medium and served close to medium, a bit overcooked. The pattie itself was flavorful, lean and proportional to the roll. The over cooking was this reviewers fault, took too long evaluating the the salads. The burger gets 2 1/2 stars.  Average:  3 stars before value considerations.  The total cost of a small plate salad and the lunch entree with a side salad and a pellegrino was $22.00, with tip, $27.00.  I left my Amex and was not contacted, so I cancelled it.  Overall, with value considerations for price, the Cheesecake Factory gets two stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-white-plains,2.56,2.71,3.032,,2.6500000000000004

The manager, (Michael?) came over to help because the people behind the cheesecake case were swamped, shortening my waiting time, excellent! I was offered the sour cream topping which was spun decoratively onto my cake, which I've never been offered in all my years of coming to pick up my son's birthday cheesecake, and he even threw in a cake server to make the job easier. While I was waiting, another person came out to tell me that they were making the topping and it would be a few minutes, so I was given time to run my errands. It's nice to see great service when youre just running in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-white-plains?start=20,2.6,2.73,3.032,,2.678

Went to dinner at 8 pm on a Sunday night and after we got seated, no waiter or waitress came to our table for 15 minutes. Finally, we asked an employee if we could get some water and he said our waitress will be with us in a couple of minutes. After 20 minutes, the waitress finally arrives. No apology or explanation for why we had to sit so long without a drink. She doesn't ask if we want anything to drink or if we want bread. She asked us if we're ready to order. After this, we asked to talk to the Manager, his name was Joe. He did nothing to make us feel welcome. Eventually, I ordered the steak and chicken combo. It was not bad, nothing special. My boyfriend ordered the cheesesteak - it was awful!!! The meat was so chewy. He barely touched it. I will never eat here again. Servers are bad, management does not care, and food is a hit or miss.

16,Mike W.,"White Plains, NY",0,2,,1.0,2017-10-23,"Back in March my wife and I were celebrating our 31st wedding anniversary with our five year old granddaughter and against my better judgement I disregarded the reviews of your restaurant. I wrote this back in March and never sent it. I ran across it again and decided you should know what you took from us that evening. It was supposed to be a fun relaxing evening instead it was an expensive disaster. I hoped against hope the reviews were wrong they were dead on unfortunately. We arrived before the evening rush and was seated in the bar area right next to the POS station. So think about this, the restaurant is one fourth full and you give us the worst seat in the restaurant. We weren't asked if this table was OK I was told it was OK. As we sat down my wife looked at me and mouthed the question is this table OK? Over my shoulder I heard two employees talking at the terminal and not wanting to hear that all dinner I went up and asked for a new table. Your restaurant made me ask for a new table already not a good start for us relaxing and you doing your job. We were then taken to the back of the restaurant where we should have been taken first.      The food was so late to come out of the kitchen one of the managers came out and apologized for the delay. Prior to that nothing was said about the delay we just sat there trying to keep our granddaughter entertained and wondering why our drinks weren't being refilled. Then as if that wasn't enough, built into the ledge next to the table there was a vent that had a rattling fan every time it turned on. We just chalked it up to the experience. When the food did arrive it was good no complaints except for the salad. After we finished our dinner my wife wanted cheese cake so we ordered it to go. At this point little had gone right for us and we were ready to go so I had hoped for some urgency from the management staff with this request but we had been forgotten it took another twenty minutes for that to happen. I thought you might like to know you could have done much better.       After I wrote this letter I was offered thirty dollars for the unsatisfactory service then on further insistence of this disastrous dinner I was offered the full price of the meal back seventy dollars. At this point seventy dollars doesn't even cover the amount of effort I had to put out just to let them know their incompetence ruined our evening. In reading the recent reviews they still haven't figured out customer service. My advice just don't go they don't deserve your business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-white-plains,2.48,2.64,3.004,,2.576

We decided to leave when I told the hostess she was apologitic, however when she told who seemed to be the manager ,who seemed to be to busy to look at me, his response was ok take care.

2,Christopher R.,"Westchester County, NY",4,83,,4.0,2017-11-03,"For casual dining, this place is outstanding. Went with my wife last night and had an excellent meal. We were seated right away and I couldn't get over the size of the place. The atmosphere is very comfortable and spacious. For appetizers, my wife had the ""Pot Stickers"" which are chicken-filled dumplings with a soy ginger sauce. She's had them before and raved about them. I had the buffalo wings. They were crispy, flavorful, and well presented. For main course, my wife had the ""Cuban Sandwich"" and I had the ""Bacon-bacon cheeseburger"" which is exactly what the menu said it would be. Cooked right and very flavorful. Tiffany, our waitress, was very friendly, polite, professional, and attentive. Even the bus staff was polite and courteous. We passed on dessert but instead, purchased a ""30th Anniversary"" cheesecake to bring home. All in all, an excellent casual dining experience. My only reason for omitting a fifth star :  Like other Yelpers (and this cannot be attributed to the establishment itself), I found  that parking is not very convenient and you have to pay for  it.

When I was seated, a dirty menu with food was given to my friend and needed to ask for a new one. I had recently reached out to the Cheesecake Factory expressing a bad experience I had and they provided me with a gift card. To be truthful, I cannot say that my most recent experience was much better. The food came out after a good amount of time but when I asked for more brown bread, it took a fairly long time for the bread to come out and my waiter had included brown and white bread (which is fine, just shows either a lack of communication that white bread is standard or forgetfulness).

1,Carolyn F.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",8,82,433.0,1.0,2018-01-05,"UPDATE: I received a generic response from someone at the restaurant. Essentially, this person confirmed that they don't take reservations. SHORT-SITED, especially since White Plains has so many great restaurants that see the value in group dining. THAT SETTLED IT: I definitely will NOT be dining at Cheesecake Factory White Plains until they become more guest-centric.  ORIGINAL REVIEW STANDS!: UNhappy Birthday: We were staying in White Plains at Athens CAMBRiA and Crowne Plaza and wanted to celebrate my Daughter's birthday over dinner at The Cheesecake Factory, White Plains on a Thursday night We were a party of 8 so at @5:30 pm, I called ahead to reserve a table. Being just 5minutes away at the CAMBRiA on a Main Street, we knew we could make it by 5:45.  Rob gave us such a hard time with the "" reservation rules"", and would not confirm a table for us, stating that 15 minutes was outside of the window that qualifies for a reservation and telling us to walk in and ""wait"". So I pressed him to get him to give me a firm time for the earliest reservation time he could offer. His response was, ""what time do you want? REALLY, Rob? Frustrated, I responded, ""the earliest you can CONFIRM a real reservation so we are not standing around."" I reminded him that we were celebrating my daughter's birthday. This fell on very deaf ears: After MORE back and forth, he reluctantly offered me 6:30- (a full hour later). When I hung up, I felt resentful of the treatment and a polled my Group. They no longer were excited about Cheesecake Factory. No one wanted to go there anymore, so I called back in order to cancel and explain why, but I was bounced around two more times and placed on hold when I asked for the manager- So, ultimately I hung up in frustration. TOO BAD they were so difficult, because their attitude LOST a birthday celebration for EIGHT covers. The single star is strictly for the attitude. As an aside, I dine out for business nearly 10 times/week and have had some good meals at Cheesecake Factory over the years, but this experience soure",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-white-plains,2.52,2.58,2.976,,2.556
