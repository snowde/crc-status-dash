I've had some awesome food here.  But a few years have gone by and now the place is terrible.   I was here a few weeks ago with my parents and items we had ordered before were simply bad this time.   I got chicken tacos and I have to say they were the most tasteless things I've ever ordered at a restaurant.  No flavor whatsoever, not even salt!  My mom got the southwest eggrolls which looked like someone hopped over to the nearest grocery store and picked up a pack of TGI Fridays frozen ones and popped them in the micro for a few minutes too long.  They were dried out, greasy little things and so spicy hot we couldn't even eat them.   Not a good experience.  I probably won't be back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-willow-grove?start=140,3.44,3.44,3.44,2.8560000000000003,3.4400000000000004

That said, I had a burger which was good, not great but not terrible. It's pretty loud and cramped because they try to put as many tables as humanly possible (plus about 12 more) in the space, probably to account for the huge demand. Speaking of, we waited 1.5 hours to get a table for two. Not really worth it. What is worth it is the cheesecake menu. The slices are huge, though, so if you can agree on one flavor, just get one and share. Alternatively, take some home to eat while watching wedding shows on TLC on Friday nights.

Then add the ""wandering whispering waiters"" and our dinner was not fun at all. The waiter came, we had to ask him to repeat several times (and no, we are not in need of hearing aides, yet); and then worried if he understood what we wanted. The food was good. It usually is.

It has always been a favorite, BUT I just recently went to the one in Willow Grove Mall on 10/2/12 around 1pm so not too busy and had the calamari appetizer and a seared ahi tuna salad.  The calamari had two onion rings and a piece of chicken all fried in the same batter in the order. It's like some onions and chicken from another order fell into the batter and they just threw it all on the same plate. Disgusting? Then (and I can't make this stuff up) my salad had a piece of thin turkey meat in it that the waitress said that they use for a different order.  Disgusting! I had the manager come over both times and he took both the calamari and the salad off of my bill. He was very pleasant about it and apologetic, but having said that I don't think I will be going back because there is clearly something very wrong in their kitchen.  No attention to detail.

At our first time, we ordered appetizer and entrees for each and ended up take out the cheesecake for dessert at home. If you come here on a warm day, don't forget to order a glass of pina colada, it is wonderful. The servers are nice and helpful.

But again, we dealt with it.  We ordered the chicken and mushroom lettuce wraps which were delicious an a great portion for $5.95.  After ordering our meals, the waitress came over to say she had a family emergency and she needed to leave but someone else would be taking over.  It was a nice and smooth transition.  Nothing went wrong.   I got the Steak Diane and Herb crusted salmon combination and dear lord, it was amazing.  That salmon was mouth watering.  My boyfriend got the pasta an chicken carbonara and loved it.  We were so full and wound up taking alot home.

You certainly can still get the ""big as your face"" type platters and their cheesecake, but if you're just in for a regular lunch and not wanting to break your diet bank for the week, they have the SkinnyLiscious menu.  I ended up getting the shrimp tacos and was very satisfied.  They were very fresh and tasty -- filled with shrimp, avocado, and slaw among other things and you get three.  I was pleasantly full at the end of the meal but felt as if I had made a healthy choice.  I opted not to eat the huge side of rice.  I had one bite, but it wasn't really good enough to be worth it. I also loved their mint iced tea.  I think I drank three when all was said and done.  Unsweetened but perfectly brewed and flavorful.   Our waitress was outstanding as well -- friendly and attentive.  I'd definitely think about going back now that they've add this menu!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-willow-grove?start=100,3.08,3.08,3.08,3.308,3.0800000000000005

I was there for my aunt's bday party with my  last Friday night which is typically an extremely busy night for any restaurant. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful to our party. I will start by saying that my aunt is bound to a wheel chair, they were helpful in making sure our family was seated in area with enough space for her and her wheelchair, moving tables and chairs to do so. Our party was also pretty large, about 15 ppl, and they were extremely helpful and accommodating with that as well. One of my cousins brought along her 2 toddler age children, who broke a plate halfway through dinner and made a mess. The staff cleaned the mess up quickly and with no attitude and were so nice to the kids during the process. Any requests that we made were quickly and accurately fulfilled for us! I don't usually write yelp reviews but felt extremely inclined to do so after this fantastic service that helped to make my aunts birthday extra special!

174,Melissa K.,"Perkasie, PA",35,44,9.0,4.0,2013-05-05,"I have been to this location a couple times and I think it is time I gave it a review.  Usually I come with my Nan, but this time it was my boyfriend's first time at a Cheesecake Factory. We had to wait 15 minutes before being seated, however, they did accommodate my request for a booth, and so it was worth the wait.  The overall appearance of this location is very spacious and airy.  The outside dining was open, but it was a little too cold for outside still.  The color scheme is warm and friendly and the bathrooms were clean.      We grabbed a drink from the bar while we waited; I had a Caribbean cooler and my other half had a glass of Shiraz.  We were acknowledged within a minute of arriving to the bar and they offered a drink menu, which was helpful, but it took too long to get our drinks and to cash out.  The bar is small but nice, but waiting to order a drink and to cash out while standing- made the experience at the bar unpleasant and not one I would return to anytime soon.  I would not order the Caribbean Cooler again because it tasted like an expensive Slurpee with fresh fruit- I could barely taste the rum, but I will take the fresh pineapple, lime and strawberry.  Also, when the sunset it was nice to have that curtain drawn down so it was not in our eyes.  When we were seated, the waitress greeted us promptly and got us water and bread quickly, which was appreciative.   The bread was warm and tasty, but the butter is always too cold and hard to spread. Her service was timely and she did not make us wait.  Food: I had the four cheese pasta with chicken and an order Edamame as my vegetable.   The Edamame is always tasty and crisp.  The only thing I wish they had was sea salt to sprinkle on it.   The four cheese pasta dish was HUGE and tasty; chicken was tender and juicy.  I liked how they brought the dish right when it was ready rather than wait for my boyfriend's dish because pasta gets cold and 'funky' quick.  I do wish there was more of a sauce on the pasta rather than it being dry.  My boyfriend got the combination of Shrimp Scampi and Steak Diane.  As a first timer to the factory, he loved the food- both from the land and the sea.  He ordered the mash potatoes as his vegetable and he greatly enjoyed them too.  He also ordered a side dish of sautéed spinach, and he was not impressed with that.  I tasted it and it was very bland and some of the spinach was not completely sautéed.  Some looked like fresh leaves tossed into the dish in the last 20 seconds of sautéing.   We ordered a cup of coffee, which was from a fresh pot, and it was good.  I always get my Dulce de Leche Carmel Cheesecake, which is always amazing!  (EVERY calorie of 1000+ :-P)  He got the Raspberry Chocolate Truffle and he loved it!  I taste it, and for not a chocolate cheesecake or cake fan- the raspberry was AMAZING!  It tasted amazing with a sip of his Shiraz.   The prices are a little high, especially when it came to the sautéed spinach and Edamame.  We will eventually visit again, but not anytime soon due to the geographic location and prices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-willow-grove?start=140,3.32,3.32,3.32,3.2800000000000002,3.3200000000000003

128,Joshua M.,"Boca Raton, FL",270,288,914.0,4.0,2013-08-14,"Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite chain restaurants, plain and simple. Actually, one of my favorite restaurants period. First off, Cheesecake Factory has literally the biggest menu I've ever seen. To get to the salads, you have to go to somewhere around page 15! Normally, I'd see too menu menu options as a restaurant not knowing what it is, and just throwing everything on a page with a total disregard for quality of the product, not here. Everything I have had here has been nothing less than great. My usual order is the Crispy Chicken Costoletta which is basically a lightly breaded chicken in a lemon sauce, served with mashed potatoes and asparagus. The chicken is divine, and the lemon sauce makes it perfect. Portion size is also huge, I am either beyond full if I finish it, or usually have another meal to take home. The mashed potatoes are good, but nothing to go crazy over. Recently, I've been splitting a bunch of appetizers with my friends, tapas style. For appetizers, I'd highly recommend the Tex Mex Eggrolls, Fried Macaroni and Cheese, and the Crispy Taquitos. All are phenomenal. The ones I am not the biggest fan of it the Spinach and Cheese dip (the spinach is flavorless and the cheese is just put on top), and the Quesadilla (chicken just tastes bland and processed).  The cheesecake deserves its own little section for just how good it is. Caution, the cheesecake is on the pricy side, I'd be much happier if it was a little bit cheaper. Nevertheless, they are all phenomenal. My favorite is Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple, but most of the other ones I've had are equally as great. My only recommendation to Cheesecake Factory would be to setup a dessert to sample a bunch of different cheesecakes, instead of paying the price to buy a bunch of them. If this exists already, shame on me for not finding it, but if it doesn't it needs to in order to taste the bliss of all these cheesecakes at once! Atmosphere here is always very nice, and plenty of room in the booths. Service wise, it really can be a bit of hit or miss. Most times my servers have been excellent, but I've had a few that were a little slow with things like getting us water, etc. Pricing is also pretty decent, it's a little bit on the more expensive side, but still worth it for what you are getting. Chain restaurants usually have a stigma attached to them, but Cheesecake Factory delivers on every aspect. This is basically my go to place anytime I'm hungry and want great food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-willow-grove?start=100,3.6,3.6,3.6,3.12,3.6000000000000005

124,Veronica K.,"Feasterville, PA",249,406,221.0,3.0,2013-09-29,"I'd always been wary of the Cheesecake Factory, mostly due to their insanely priced cheesecakes themselves. Before my visit here, I'd only ever got cake to go from the KoP location, and despite the good quality, $8 for a slice of cheesecake seems steep. Anyway, I ended up at the Willow Grove location last night because a friend wanted to have her birthday party there. I'll start with the good; the food was (mostly) delicious. I had their loaded nachos (don't remember the menu name), which consisted of thick nachos that seemed to be fried on premises. I also had the chicken samosas, which were awesome, and while not completely authentic, they had a nice curry flavor that was palatable for American taste buds but still distinctly tasted like an Indian masala. Also, their cheesecake is obviously quite good. I had some of their new s'more edition and it lived up to the hype. Also, I tend to like the decor inside, even if it is quite dark. So here's the cons. My house salad was disgusting - the salad itself was wilted and the vinaigrette they put on it only served to make the aging leaves even more bitter. Luckily, this was the only bad item anyone got and the rest of our food was edible. Worse than this, is that the staff, particularly hostesses, are very rude. They seemed angry we had a large group, and gave us poor accommodations so that one person had to sit on a rickety chair in the middle of the aisle. Also our waitress seemed over worked and barely checked on us, so sadly I personally will refrain from ever going there on a Saturday again, as the attitude was too much. For being a chain, it's not bad. I'll come again on a week day and do an update, and see if any of my issues are resolved.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-willow-grove?start=100,3.76,3.76,3.76,2.8920000000000003,3.76

I got the bang bang chicken and shrimp which was also very delicious but there was not enough ""sauce"" to go with the gigantic scoop of white rice. And my sister ordered the bistro shrimp pasta which was soooo flavorful!!!! I kept eating hers!!

91,Jamie C.,"Vancouver, Canada",23,60,138.0,4.0,2014-12-02,"Cheesecake Factory is our go to restaurant when shopping at the Willow Grove Mall. My mom and I like to go on Sundays when they offer the extended breakfast/brunch menu.  Recently we went in and they offered a free cheesecake slice gift card for purchasing a $25+ gift card.  We ran into this deal a few times in the past holiday seasons so I bought a gift card and was able to use the gift card right away, but the cheesecake voucher cannot be used the same day.  Which is fine with me, I can wait till later to use it! My favorites from the ""Brunch"" menu which is offered only on Sundays until 3pm are the Bruleed French Toast, Lemon-Ricotta Pancake, and the Baja Chicken Hash. The Bruleed French Toast is humongous... well, most of their dishes are, but I've never finished the french toast in one sitting.  It's not an overpowering creme brulee flavor, but just the right amount.   Same goes for the Lemon-Ricotta Pancakes.  It has a faint lemon and ricotta taste.  I love lemon flavors in pastries and breakfast items so this is definitely one of my favorites!  It's usually topped with sliced strawberries but I've seen people ask for different fruit toppings and they weren't charged extra for the replacement. For both the sweet brunch dishes, you don't get any savory sides with them, but you can order meat or a breakfast side if you'd like.  I think the french toast actually does apprear again on the menu with a side included, but I've never ordered it that way. If I'm not in the mood for something sweet, I always get the Baja Chicken Hash for brunch.  It's a generous portion with two large crisp tortillas topped with veggies, chicken, beans, and poached eggs.  So delicious! Aside from the brunch menu, Cheesecake Factory has so many different options on their menu... it'll take you a while to look through everything if it's your first time, but everything is really pretty tasty :)  My favorites on regular menu: Miso Salmon Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta Chicken Bellagio Grilled Shrimp and Bacon Club Sandwich Enjoy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-willow-grove?start=80,3.32,3.36,3.36,2.544,3.3440000000000003

Upon arrival, I noticed throngs of people standing and waiting for tables. I waited my turn and asked about the length of the wait. I was told less than 30 minutes by the hostess at the desk. I explained about my calling earlier and how i was told that there was no wait. She insisted, it was not possible and that was mistaken. I showed her their phone number on my phone to document that I called. Forty-five minutes later, still no table. I asked to see the manager and explained what happened. I said that his staff should not tell people, that call, that there is no wait, when they call in advance. I also explained that I was told, upon arrival, that the wait would be thiry minutes and that it was now over forty-five minutes. The Manager applogized. That was it! He didn't offer to seat us or look into it. Just an appology and a blank stare. Unacceptable! At least offer to look into what happened, offer us a glass of wine, a complimentary appetizer or a free dessert.

How do you mess up on french fries? I got a dish that is supposedly ""shepherd's pie"" but it was definitely not. It was just patty meat chopped up in gravy with mash on top. Disappointing.

It didn't allow for any personal space. The other downside is that they placed people on either side of us making us feel cramped. This was unnecessary as like I said the place wasn't busy and there was empty tables all over the restaurant. Other than that it was pleasant. Our waiter was phenomenal.

My boyfriend and I had a table outside and waited for almost an hour for our food. I ordered the tomato basil pasta and he had the Steak Diane and salmon. When the food finally arrived, both our dishes were slightly cold and his steak was over-cooked. We told the waitress who took his dish back to the kitchen. The pasta wasn't too bad so we kept it. Until I noticed there was a stray spaghetti noodle in the penne. We called the waitress over who had a long explanation of how it ""happens all the time."" Finally, my boyfriend's dish was replaced. The steak was not flavorful at all and not worth the money we paid for it. We finished our meals and left incredibly dissatisfied. We forgot about the whole experience until, a few hours later, my boyfriend began to experience a stomach ache and eventually developed nausea. Over the course of the next 10 hours, he has had intense stomach pain and threw up five times. He didn't eat anything the entire day besides the steak dish which led to one conclusion: he got food poisoning from the Cheesecake Factory.

68,C C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",8,225,281.0,3.0,2015-09-15,"I stopped by for lunch on a weekday. They weren't very busy, and we were quickly seated. Our server was nice, and the service was timely. We were served bread first, and it was delicious. Warm and soft, it tasted like it was fresh out of the oven. There were two kinds, one brown and one white. Both were good, but I liked the brown better. It was a little sweet. I did enjoy the crisper crust of the white bread, though. I ordered the Thai lettuce wraps. My sister had a kale and quinoa salad, and my mom ordered a turkey sandwich off the ""skinny menu."" I was pretty happy with my choice; as a shareable appetizer, it was actually a lot for one person. The three sauces were delicious and so flavorful. The vegetables were fresh, and the red cabbage was particularly delicious since it's usually so tough in texture. Unfortunately, the texture of the noodles was not good--they weren't chewy at all. It tasted like they'd been refrigerated to cool down quickly. The salad was good, but the dressing made it a little too salty. My mom enjoyed her burger, but I guess there was a caloric price to pay because it looked really small and sad on a large plate. I don't think she was full, either. So bottom line for the entrées of the day is, yummy with some drawbacks. And of course we had to get dessert. This is the only restaurant we ever get dessert. And on those rare occasions in other restaurants when we get dessert, we always get one to share. But at the Cheesecake Factory, each person gets his or her own cheesecake slice. My sister got the strawberry, my mom got caramel du leche, and I ordered the 30th anniversary one, which is cheesecake layered with chocolate cake. The crust is made of chocolate in various forms. It was so rich, I couldn't get in more than a few bites. But for the next few days, I had a delicious treat in the fridge! Everyone else enjoyed their cheesecake, too. Can't wait to go back and try some of the other cheesecakes!

132,Dave D.,"North Wales, PA",31,7,,1.0,2016-05-08,"Beware! The Cheesecake Factory in Willow Grove PA has HORRENDOUS customer service. I ordered our meal to go. The server took the order properly, but the kitchen skipped one of the meals. When I picked up the order, the clerk at the register said it was never given and that I could order it then and pay for it so that I wouldn't have to wait in line again. When I pointed out that the meal was written on the order, she did nothing to rectify the situation other than to want me to pay for it now so I could leave sooner when it was ready. I asked for the manager and explained the situation to him, and he was just as apathetic. Since I already had the other meals, why would I want to wait while they cooked the missing meal and have the other meals get cold? His reply was a shrug of the shoulders. The manager didn't care that I would end up with either 3 hot meals and a missing meal, or three cold meals and one hot meal. He made no offer to alleviate the situation by offering a gift certificate for a later use to try to keep my business.

I usually have a good experience here but this time, something was not quite right with the food. I ordered a brunch special- chicken and waffles with eggs Benedict. Sounds delicious right? Nope! The waffles were ok. The chicken was moist but was smothered in the hollandaise sauce so I couldn't taste the flavor of the chicken. I don't understand the little potatoes they give you as a side  why not regular size potatoes or hash browns? Anyway, my husband ordered a breakfast combo, pancakes, eggs and bacon.

The problem with this restaurant is that your experience really depends on which waitor/waitress you end up with. You can end up with one who doesn't care about you and whether or not you enjoy your food or not. There is no consistency with the staff members.

61,Ravindran C.,"Willow Grove, PA",3,29,7.0,4.0,2016-05-15,"Well.. the first thing is - for whatever rhyme or reasons, this turns out to be a hangout spot whenever my friends come visiting in to my place. And so far, it has not been a disappointing experience any time. This place is pretty crowded for the most part of the time - regardless of the day of the week you walk into. And the not so nice part is that they don't take in reservations. So, you are definitely getting a raw deal if you are not able to plan much for a free form dining. The ambience of the place in itself is pretty good - and also, appears to be kind of standardized all over. I have not seen a different ambience at different Cheesecake factory outlets so far. As for the parking - you definitely get the parking space from the mall :) You do have a deal of outdoor dining in an explicit fashion for the summers and there is also an ""outdoosy"" feel from the mini out door setup within the mall side of the area that is OUTSIDE of the restaurant area itself :D   Moving out to the food portion of it - I must admit that though I have been here multiple times with multiple people, I haven't quite tried a lot of stuff myself. So, some of the review here should be a combination of what I have eaten plus what my friends had along with me. The freshly squeezed orange juice - it is a class apart. You don't get to have automatic refills. But I can safely bet you would only be asking for more when you have a sip of it. Chicken di pana - thin slices of breaded chicken cooked to perfection in a white wine sauce. The serving size is pretty generous and therefore, you might even be left wondering how you would be able to complete the accompanying broccoli and mashed potatoes Veggie Burger - This is par excellence. Neatly done patties that seem to be quite freshly made from a combination of rice and beans. Brought in with sliced onions, lettuce, tomatoes and jalapenos. The patty is topped with a cheese - and I believe you can let them know your choice of it.  They have a very extensive menu and I am not hoping to try out everything even with all combinations of folks eating out with me!

The food was warm, always a plus, I've been served ice cold frozen food at a restaurant before. But that's food prep basics. I ordered fish and chips.  The pros: the fish and fries were crispy and warm. The cons: Salty, greasy, yet magically flavorless. Cole slaw was not cold. It was julienned veggies that weren't even properly cut. No acid in the slaw at all. Tasted like it was tossed in mayo, no salt, no vinegar, no citrus, just mayo. I tried one of my kid's chicken strip.

43,David W.,"Philadelphia, PA",54,198,624.0,2.0,2016-07-01,"This was my first visit to a Cheesecake Factory location. Very convenient for shopping at the Willow Grove Mall, but if I were in the Mall, I'd probably opt for one of the other places in the food court. Our server, Amanda, was great. Very attentive and friendly. Arriving in the early afternoon, we were seated immediately in the patio, at our request. Because of the brutal Mall landscaping (""keep it visible, and they will come""), there are of course no trees around the Mall. Ironic, given the history of Willow Grove Park. So the table umbrellas provide limited shade, and the metal table top - oh my, they can get hot in the sun. We had to move to another table where some shade was available, and Amanda nicely facilitated that. But my complaint is with the restaurant's pricing. For example, I thought the $3.00 coffee was not a good value for the quality, not that it was bad - but it wasn't really great either. The same applies to the other items we ordered. The Caesar Salad with chicken ($17) was very large, but reportedly had really dry chicken. The kids Mac n Cheese ($7) gives you a sense of the pricing range. Pricey - about 25% above comparable dining experiences, but without any distinguishing qualities justifying the pricing. There is an extensive menu, and the interior decoration of the restaurant itself looked spectacular, in a kind of touristy way, if you go for that sort of thing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-willow-grove?start=40,2.2,2.88,2.88,2.568,2.608

The service was horrblie...we were forgotten and ignored. Food took over 45 minutes to come out and they were not even busy.  I highly suggest that you ask the price of their alcoholic drinks before ordering. A 5 oz. daquiri should not cost $8.95 and could not taste any alcohol in it. And my watered-down-all- ice (even though I specifically told the waitress very little ice) sangria was $10.25!!!  I think I may have gotten about 3 oz.of drink, if that .And the six small pieces of cheese bread costs no where near to $8.95 - and charging $3 for seltzer water with lemon is outrageous.  The portions were average to very little. The Asian Lettuce Wraps was bascially lettuce filled with rice noodles - the piece of chicken was literally 2 bites. The Chicken & Biscuits was served with burnt bottoms (biscuits).  I know we could have complained to the wiatress but she was no where and I mean no where to be found the entire time we were eating.  We had to wave her down as she passed by to get our check.  She never came back for payment so I went to the hostess to pay - was informed she can not take payment and must pay the waitress. I explained we had been waiting for her to come back to our table for over 10 minutes. The hostess did not ask who our waitress was or offer to get her for us.  I took the opprotunity to air all of my complaints to the hostess.

There are some fabulous looking salads and, of course, an insane dessert selection, but I opted for the grilled fish tacos this time. The corn tortillas were nicely grilled and filled with slaw, grilled fish, pico de gallo and fresh avocado. The dish was accompanied by lime cilantro rice and black beans. The rice and beans were both tasty, but the rice was a bit greasy. My daughter got a chicken Caesar salad and shrimp scampi minus tomatoes. The salad was good. The dressing is garlicky but not bad for bottled Caesar. The shrimp in the scampi dish was breaded and the sauce creamy, which are atypical of traditional scampi. It was also very garlicky.

88,N M.,"Elkins Park, PA",0,1,,1.0,2016-08-06,"As much as I like their cakes and especially the strawberry shortcake, I don't think I will ever be going back there. After having lunch one day, my husband and I decided to get some cake to go on the way out. Well, there was a man behind the counter and he was cleaning up and then tying a trash bag. He had gloves on--great! Except then, after another person took our order, the first man took out a to go box with the same gloves that he used to clean and tie the trash bag and picked up a slice of cake, (with those same gloves!) and put it in that box. Personally, I think that is unacceptable.  Several months later, we came back hoping things have changed for the better. Did they? Only in my dreams, unfortunately. My husband came to pick up a to-go order of strawberry shortcake. The lady behind the counter didn't know how to make it so she asked her co-worker; fine. However, there was about 1tbsp of strawberries left in their container so she poured it all out into the little box. My husband mentioned that it probably won't be enough. She said, ""this is how much we give everyone"" after just minutes earlier saying that she didn't know how to make it. AND, we've gotten strawberry shortcake before and it certainly comes with more than just 1 cut-up strawberry! The manager happened to walk by; she whispered something into his ear, he gave my husband a dirty look and walked off. Another man, who was cleaning the counters,  chopped up 2 more strawberries (without changing gloves or washing his hands) and added them to what was already in the container. Yuck. Then, he went, took orders, came back and with the same gloves, continued to put cakes for people; obviously he touched the cakes.  I don't know about anyone else, but personally, I don't find it very sanitary to ties garbage bags, wash counters and then use the same gloves to touch people's food. I mean, they're gloves! You're not even washing your hands, just changing them! Is it really that big of a deal?!

This particular chain however does offer a lot of variety so for that, I like it. The menu, as many of you know is absolutely huge and extensive. There is something for everyone... the health-conscious and the ones who want to splurge on big giant piece of nine dollar cheesecake alike. There are also gluten-free and dairy free items clearly marked. I do love Ana greatly appreciate that all menu items are listed with their calorie content and have been way before it was trendy. I also like the option to get a lunch sized portion of any of their dinner entrees.  I've been to three different locations, center city, KOP and this one. This location is OK. They all pretty much look the same with that somewhat Tuscan decor and all locations are pretty large. I have personally never had to wait here, but I usually come during the day, during the week.  This spot makes for a good stop mid shopping spree and I think that the area and the mall alike needed something like. This Cheesecake Factory is a good option if you're looking for a sit-down meal rather than takeout from the food court while here at Willow Grove. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but for a mall day, it's a good option.  I've never had a bad meal here. My go to lately is the vegan Cobb. It's huge and tasty. It can easily be made into two meals or split amongst the entire table. Try it! Crispy and crunchy! Prices are fair, portions are hearty and service here has been pretty good each time we have visited.

Before I was a vegetarian, I really enjoyed the CF.  The chicken and dumplings were de-licious.  Last night my friend and I were meeting at a local Vietnamese restaurant, but they happened to be closed for the Chinese New Year (sad face).  So we opted to go here instead.  I thought to myself 'I just saw someone on youtube raving about their veggie burger - I have to try it!!' No.  No, no, no.  It was not de-licious.  It was probably the worst veggie burger I've had.  I'm not sure why restaurants feel like people who don't eat meat want a mushed together patty of rice and some other vegetables I couldn't even tell you were in their based on taste.  That doesn't replicate a burger at all.  I sadly would have been happier going to Red Robin.  So there's the lesson you can take away from this review - if you are a veghead and want a burger you are going to enjoy - skip the Cheesecake Factory and head directly to the nearest Red Robin and order their Boca burger!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-willow-grove?start=40,2.72,2.77,2.77,2.6320000000000006,2.75

We waited about 10-15 minutes which isn't bad for this place. It tends to get very crowded. We were sat just outside the main restaurant. When we being sat the table was still dirty from the previous guests. It was also very loud and very cold in that section. We ordered drinks and dinner at the same time. We waited a bit for the server to greet us. This was by far the worst service we've had in a long time. The girl didn't tell us her name, she was very flat and unenthusiastic to say the least. Our daughter ordered an orange juice, literally took 25 minutes to get it. We had to ask twice, we were told it's fresh squeezed so it takes a while. We had TJ ask for bread, didn't receive lemons in water or tea (we did ask). Worst of all was the wait time for food. With no exaggeration it took an hour for our food. Tables that were sat after us were eating before us. I understand a restaurant can get busy and things happen. The main issue is the server made no attempt to inform us as to what was going on. She was honestly one of the worst servers we've ever had. She didn't seem to care a bit. The manager did bring our food out personally and apologized. She then came over again after the meal and asked how everything was. The food was good but there is no reason for 2 entrees to take an hour. She offered us free dessert and we declined. She then took of one of our meals. It was a nice gesture but it was too late. We left very unhappy.

I went yesterday for the National cheesecake day  ""1/2 price sale"". What a mess! The cheesecake is costly at $9.00 a slice so to get it at $4.50 ( closer to an average price ...is great) I went late around 9 pm thinking the line would be over- no luck. The cashier rang me up in about 15 minutes- I thought ok 15-20 min is about how long I thought it would take- WRONG! I was there 50 min in total. There is no reason for this. They KNEW they are having a sale and should have been ready, How hard is it to cut a piece of cake and put it in a bag? I've worked customer service and this could have been avoided- there was ONE cashier and several other workers and still they took close to an hour to serve a piece of cake? Why didn't they prep the job? 1 day before the sale- you cut up several of each kind of cheesecake put it in plastic ""to go containers "" and put them back in a circle with the flavor tag and store them in the case behind the cashier which has tons of room. You have the managers and hourly employees come in early the two days in a row to get the cakes set up- and stay late if needed and you assign a person or two to just cut and pack  on those 2 days. On top of it all the manager? behind the counter who was reading the slips and packing did not seem to follow the correct order as people after me left before me with their food WTH?! A simple way to keep order would be to number the slips 1-20 in a black sharpie when 20 is gone start again at one. They ran out of some flavors and I can understand that. But this was just so unorganized. There is no reason to wait 50 min for 2 slices of cheesecake. I could give them a ton of ways this could have been done correctly oh and it looked like there were lots of servers waiting to also get cake for the dine in customers. Are you telling me your servers can't just put a slice of cake on a plate and go--- Good Grief! Also the music was so loud it was hard to hear the names and dishes were clanging all over the place. It's a shame as I enjoy the food but figured it was too long to wait for a table and service and thought a late night treat would be fun.

My MIL (who has quite discerning taste) was impressed.  Then the bill came and the apple juice was on it. Note it was called ""juice"" on the bill not ""cider"". Oh and speaking of the bill, they put misleading tip percentages on the bill. They are supposed to base the tip on the pre-tax amount, but they base it on the post tax amount. Shady.

I didn't want an insanely thick dinner+dessert so I opted to pick from their low-calorie menu for dinner, known as the Skinnylicious menu. I'm not going to lie, I really dislike that name - I felt really silly ordering the Skinnylicious shrimp tacos. But I was surprised at the plate when it came out, I was expecting dinky little taco shells with maybe a single shrimp in each to help keep the calories low But I was pleasantly surprised at the portion size.  Generally, the food itself was fine. Nothing bad, just nothing to write home about. The tacos were a little bland. And I've noticed that as well with other meals I've had at various Cheesecake Factory locations too, not necessarily specific to this location. I've never had a bad meal there, I just feel like in a restaurant where most everything is on its A-game, the entrees are just okay.  I got the low carb Cheesecake with strawberries. This more than makes any meal there worth it, and is what keeps us going back. It was unbelievably tasty and rich. My wife got the celebration cheesecake which had some birthday cake baked into it. We of course shared, and both were top notch.  Also, top marks go to our server Lexi. She was great. She handled her job well, but was definitely keeping us laughing and smiling every time she stopped by to check in on us. She should be commended for her great attitude and sense of humor. Whenever we go back, we will hope to be served by her every time we go.  A fun little observation: some of the decor in there reminds me of the Eye Of Sauron from the Lord Of The Rings movies.

I then ordered the Margherita Pizza and this came out way overdone. Luckily they did not charge us for either.

We had drinks refilled and everyone's order met expectations. We celebrated my husband's 35th Birthday, and the other servers came out and sang to him and comped his Snickers Cheesecake. The proverbial icing on the cake (no pun intended) was that Rebecca actually let us split the check. My husband I were there with 6 other couples and a single person. each married couple had their own check. Don't ask how she did it...but she did! Amazing!

19,Maria L.,"Ambler, PA",4,17,13.0,4.0,2017-11-20,"We went to this restaurant on a Friday night. Of course busy. We waited for about an hour before we were seated.  We met our waitress and she introduced herself. We ordered our appetizers , food and drinks at that time we were starving.  Our buffalo blast did not arrive until about an 1 hr.    And when they did arrive - the waitress immediately  came over to apologize.  She said she spoke with her manager and mentioned that we waited a long time for our appetizers. She came and sat beside me which i did appreciate. Since we waited so long, the manager said we could take the appetizers off the bill or 2 cheese cake desserts.   We chose the desserts. Our dinner did arrived shortly after.  Presentation of our food was good and the food tasted delicious.  I did order a margarita. The taste was good but sadly the glass was small and with the ice- there was not much to drink.  Once we were done - we asked for the check- and our waitress said ther the buffalo blast were taken off the bill.   It was a win win for us. Thank you cheese cake factory for being aware of your customers  I will cont to go to this restaurant.  I gave it 4 stars- we waited 1 hr  before being seated and 1 hr for our appetizers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-willow-grove,2.88,2.86,2.86,,2.868
8,Lindsey D.,"Enfield, CT",272,46,13.0,3.0,2017-11-24,Always great service and extensive menu. Menu is labeled if an item has gluten in it. I love their Cobb salad! Very accommodating of my gluten allergy but they do not have gluten free bread but serve regular bread on the table before food comes - this has happened to me about 3 times now. This is frustrating for someone who has a gluten allergy!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-willow-grove,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84

1,Lisa M.,"Philadelphia, PA",61,8,1.0,1.0,2017-12-12,"Before I write this review, I just wanted to say that I tried to address this matter over the Cheesecake factory website but they never responded or addressed a major concern I had over my experience. I went to the Cheesecake factory on Tuesday, December 5th around 7pm. Even though it was busy, we were promptly seated at a table, no complaints there. We ordered the appetizer and it was pretty delicious (chicken samosas). Service was very slow and eventually my entree (fish and chips) finally came out. It tasted pretty good but in one of the bites I took of the battered fish, I thought I had a ""bone"" in my mouth. It was very hard and impossible to chew, and upon removing the ""bone"" from my mouth I actually saw that it was a shiny piece of metal *drum roll here*.. A STAPLE. That is right, somehow a staple ended up in my fish. I promptly told the waitress that I wouldn't be eating this any further because of my concern that possibly another staple could be in my food. I really wish I was making up this story because literally my whole night was ruined. The waitress took it away and said that my meal and any dessert I chose would be on the house. She also offered me another meal, however I declined. She said it could have been a piece of metal from the frying bin? LIKE WHY IS THE FRYING BIN FALLING APART? HOW IS THAT OK? SO there we have it, my awful experience at the Cheesecake factory. If you go, be careful and weary.  This definitely raised a huge red flag for me. I don't like to question the integrity and safety of my food so I most likely won't be returning to any of the locations.   On a side note, I had a friend that was served glass in his water at another location.

I didn't get a single leaf of spinach, not one blueberry, and almonds were no where to be found. I did find a stray pear or grape here and there, but this salad (prepared at the Willow Grove location) was mostly a pile of ""salad greens"".  Oh wait. And one tiny morsel of broccoli.

I did get in contact with a representative from corporate after they read my review He was very helpful and even compensated me for my trouble  with a $25 gift card I was able to get into more detail about my experience . I hope the manager has since received more training  or has found a new job that is not in the hospitality/customer service field,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-willow-grove,2.64,2.66,2.66,,2.652
