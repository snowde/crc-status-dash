248,Sandy H.,"Orlando, FL",0,33,,3.0,2012-01-24,"We are long time patrons of all Cheesecake Factories. Love their food, their unbelievable selection of menu items and of course, their scrumptious cheesecakes! 9 out of 10 visits are very good for the most part. At this location, however, on a recent visit, I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta (one of my favorites). When it arrived at our table, the dish was 1/2 the size it normally is ($16.95) for this dish. I was with several clients, so I did not want to make a scene, but I was shocked to say the least. I thought maybe they had mistakenly given me a lunch size portion of this meal and would have charged me accordingly, but that was not the case. I was still charged the $16.95 price. Normally, I would eat 1/2 of this meal and take the other half home, acceptable solution for the high priced meal. Not on this occasion. I ate the entire 1/2 portion that was served to me. I left very disappointed. Not only was the portion 1/2 it's normal size, but the chicken in this dish was grizzly, someone forgot to trim the fat off the chicken! I contacted CCF through their website the next day and also called management at the CCF store to tell them what happened. No response from their website. No return call from management either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park?start=240,3.72,3.72,3.72,2.9240000000000004,3.7200000000000006
233,Heidi B.,"Orlando, FL",74,160,24.0,5.0,2012-02-01,"Alright so I have to preface this review by stating that I love The Cheesecake Factory as a chain, regardless of the location or size of the restaurant itself.  Having said that, I really do enjoy the Winter Park Village Cheesecake Factory. I first started frequenting this Cheesecake when I moved to Orlando to go to school at UCF, and even though it was a little bit of a trek to get there, I always had a fun time going whether it was for a birthday dinner, date, or girls' night out. The ambiance of this restaurant is great--dim lighting, high ceilings, with plenty of indoor seating, some outdoor seating, a full bar, and even a bakery area for those who just want to order cheesecake or other delectable desserts.  As far as the service goes, I have actually never experienced an issue at this particular Cheesecake Factory. I unfortunately can't say the same about my old hometown Cheesecake in Fort Lauderdale, but I have also come to realize that if you go to any restaurant often enough you're likely to encounter a problem at some point.  One thing I do love at Cheesecake Factory is the bread basket. Another is the strawberry lemonade--worth a try if you've never had it anymore and enjoy sweet beverages. I would also recommend any of their salads, keeping in mind that their salads are HUGE (the good thing is they do sell half-salad portions). And of course if you've never had it, you need to try a slice of cheesecake--even if you have to share it across the table!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park?start=180,3.76,3.76,3.76,3.0920000000000005,3.76

Everything we tried - aside from the cheesecake - was over salted, and otherwise bland, my pasta especially. It's sad that the only spice some restaurants seem to know how to use is salt. There's so many other flavors out there! They don't skimp on the portions either, and the cheesecake was no exception. The one slice we shared looked as large as my face, and so sweet that neither of us could finish it. That being said, the service was quick and nice.

This last visit was with my mother and niece. We ordered a few appetizers and entrees and everything was just ok. The lettuce wraps, which I was very excited about, left me wanting more. Service was really nice, but pretty slow. Especially when the restaurant was almost empty.  My favorite part of this Cheesecake Factory is the location...super close to shops and the movie theater.

Whenever I travel to different cities, I always check to see if they have this restaurant. The food is great, the menu selection is enormous, the portions are large, the cheesecakes are good with about 30 kinds to choose from, the mojitos are Miami quality. I can not say much about how the service is at the tables because I always go to the bar. But I do get good service at the bar. Some people might complain about the prices especially if they are trying to feed a big family. They probably should go to Applebee's.

139,Sydney K.,"Orlando, FL",112,293,43.0,3.0,2013-04-02,"So, it's your standard Cheesecake Factory. My experiences here have overall been positive, but when it's bad, it's bad. So, I'm not really sure how to review the Cheesecake Factory, but what I can say is it's what you'd expect from this establishment. Long waits for dinner, especially on Friday or Saturday nights, decor that seems like a Rococo mess, and tasty food that may or may not be a heart attack waiting to happen. The good: Overall my experiences with the employees here have been positive. There was this one woman who didn't like the fact that my group was there for dessert only and proceeded to almost attack one of our party with the cheesecake (it had a rough landing), but I don't think she's there anymore. I like the lighter choices menu because you still get tasty food but at a lesser cost to your health. I really love the beet and goat cheese salad, but recently there has been less deliciousness on the plate. I also like the blue cheese flatbread and the turkey burger, but it seems that most things on that menu are a good choice. The cheesecake is pretty good, though I'm a bit of a purist with my cheesecake tastes. It can also be pretty pricey as a slice goes for $7-8. Still, one slice is enough for 3 or 4 people to split if you're feeling thrifty. They also don't make their cheesecake there from what I understand, so I'm disappointed in that. The bad: The calorie counts can be absurd. I know this can be true anywhere, but how do you fit 2000 calories into a shrimp sandwich?! I definitely recommend checking the nutrition info before you go, or at least try to order off the lighter menu if you're trying to be health conscious. The wait can easily hit an hour at peak times, which I know isn't a lot compared to some places. Still, I feel like that's a long time to wait for the Cheesecake Factory. Once you're seated the lights are usually quite dim and the noise can be quite loud. Not exactly my type of place (I like to see my food and dining companions personally), but that in and of itself isn't a bad thing. Long story short, it's Cheesecake Factory, you get what you know you're getting. I prefer patronizing local businesses when I can, but there's nothing wrong with this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park?start=140,3.56,3.56,3.56,2.604,3.5600000000000005

After a long hot day at Disney World, we left and wanted a restaurant that we knew would not cost us a small fortune with consistently good food. So, we decided to visit the Cheesecake Factory in Winter Park. And we were not disappointed. The four of us had a wonderful meal making our experience an A-1 day. Our server brought some tasty homemade bread that came directly from the oven. As others have mentioned, the menu is extensive with so many choices. It took us a while to make a decision.  I ordered the Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp (note although the menu says spicy; it was not) and the rest of the family ordered the Chicken Di Pano, the Skinnylicious Spicy Chicken salad and the New Orleans Shrimp. Each meal was delicious and portions sizable, with the exception of the New Orleans Shrimp. The New Orleans Shrimp portion was much smaller than all the other dinners. We were all satisfied. I am not sure if it possible to come to this restaurant and not order cheesecake, is it? We ordered the Ultimate Red Velvet cheesecake and the Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cheesecake. I am not much of a sweets person, but I did taste each. I first tried the Ultimate. It was yummy with a cream cheese frosting and shaved white chocolate covering the sides. However, the Reese's cheesecake was no doubt the best dessert I have ever had. OMG! If you like chocolate and peanut butter, this is a MUST try. Our server was great and friendly. The only criticism I have is the floors were very slick. It was raining that day. Their shiny tile floors and rain do not really work well together. All in all, we all agreed that the food was delicious and was a nice topper to the family day at Disney World.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park?start=200,3.6,3.6,3.6,2.7039999999999997,3.6000000000000005

145,Jackie S.,"Daytona Beach, FL",28,325,329.0,2.0,2013-05-12,"Oh Cheesecake Factory - what are you doing and why are you doing it wrong?! It was my in-laws anniversary and my mother in law decided, lets go to the Cheesecake Factory. We arrived at around 6pm and the wait time was 40 minutes, which, I'm sure is reasonable for a Saturday night. With only having 4 people in our party, we were unable to make a reservation, which, is okay too.  When we got seated we were promptly greeted by our server, Cesar, who started out great but then as the evening progressed, he became evenless attentive, making the first experience of my father in law, not so great. Issue 1 - my father in law ordered the Herb Encrusted Filet of Salmon. The menu is not lying - the salmon is encrusted in so much parsley that you can't see a hint of pink only green. He compared the salmon to a field of grass that needed to be mowed. He said that the mashed potatoes were very sweet and the asparagus was not cooked thoroughly (still tough and not tender). The salmon is served on top of a lemon sauce which soaked into the mashed potatoes and turned them into soup.  Issue was rectified by him ordering a boring Club sandwich. Issue 2 - my hubs ordered the Grilled Pork Chop which was accompanied with mashed potatoes, broccoli, and apple sauce, along with an unknown gravy that was poured over everything. The apple sauce wasn't strained prior to being placed on the plate and the excess juice from the apple sauce mixed into the mashed potatoes making them overly sweet. He was able to pour the water/sauce/gravy into the dish that they brought us the butter in.  Issue was rectified by him ordering the tried and true, Louisiana Chicken pasta. We each ordered a Caesar side salad which was delicious. My mother in law ordered the Fettucini with Chicken and Sundried Tomatoes (the only dish she's willing to try) and I ordered my usual (Louisiana Chicken Pasta).  For dessert, I ordered the Lemon Raspberry cheesecake which was amazing (nuff said). It had the perfect blend of being sweet yet tangy at the same time. Its a combination of cheesecake with lady fingers, mousse, and cake.  FYI - the later in the evening, the dimmer the lighting in the dining areas.

I ate the salad though and the lettuce left a very bitter taste in my mouth...blech, was not good. My moms omelette literally had almost a whole onion in it and the potatoes were burnt to a crisp.  When my sandwich finally came out, it was fine, but it was literally covered in cheese--I just wanted one slice and my sandwich was drenched in it. It tasted fine, but ugh once again, left a BAD aftertaste. My mother could hardly eat her meal, too many onions and burnt food. Needless to say, we paid, and got the hell out. On our way home we actually had to stop at a gas station and get water because we both had horrible tastes in our mouths. I still love TCF, but definitely will never come back to this one again.

236,Ashley H.,"Orlando, FL",228,378,23.0,3.0,2013-10-27,"If you've ever been to The Cheesecake Factory, you pretty much know what you're getting into. Huge restaurant, even bigger menu, and usually (if you're like me) you don't have room for actual cheesecake.  My favorite dish is the Tuna Tataki Salad. Pricy, yes, but it's a large salad with seared ahi tuna slices, avocado, tomato, greens, and a delicious soy-based dressing to go with it. A really healthy and yummy option. I also love the chicken pot stickers, although they have definitely gone up in price in the last year! My fiance loves the chicken parmesan sandwich and orders it every time we go.  The reason I couldn't rate this higher is because of the service. I go here by myself a lot, and the service can be spotty. If I'm alone, a lot of people choose to ignore me and focus on other people. However, last time we were here, I had the worst possible service. We ordered everything right away, from drinks to appetizers.  It took about 15 minutes to get any kind of drink on the table. Closer to 25 for the appetizer. But the entree? We waited over an hour to receive our food. At first we were nice about it and asked our server a few times. She kept saying it was ""coming out in a few minutes"". At one point she finally admitted that she put the food in late. She told us the food would come ""in two minutes"". Two minutes became 20. We politely asked to speak with a manager. When no one came, my fiance had to actually get up from the table and find her himself. Our food came as the manager arrived, and we explained our situation. I was really polite about the whole thing and just explained why we weren't happy.  At first she tried to excuse the situation by saying that the server was ""pacing our food"". I wasn't buying that, because no one paces out food for this long of a meal. Other patrons had already come and gone by the time we received our food. She looked at me and said, ""What do you want me to do?"" Like I was a nuisance to her. I asked her what she would normally do in this situation, and she said, ""Well, do you want to eat it or not?"" She was so charming, let me tell you. She walked away to let us decide whether we wanted to eat our food or not. We did, and asked for the check. They took off our entrees, which I felt was appropriate but never would have asked for.  The manager's response was so awful that I honestly feel like I would drive to the Millennia location before I'd come back to this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park?start=180,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.9880000000000004,3.0000000000000004
122,Digital B.,"Longwood, FL",17,351,62.0,1.0,2014-01-01,"I used to love eating here until I had one of my supervisors bring me back a meal to the office for me. I was working late and they got me a chicken dish with potatoes and some other veggies. While I was eating I crunched down on to something hard. When I pulled it out of my mouth it looked like a small pebble or a broken chunk of glass (tempered). I checked my tooth, which was hurting really bad, and it had chipped (yes, I later went to the dentist, but that wasn't the issue really - see below). I called my boss in and showed him but he just shrugged his shoulders and told me to call the company. I called them that evening and I spoke to the manager who directed me to a number in California. This was my first sign that there was a problem because the manager should have just offered me a gift card or a free meal but it only made things worse. I called the number given to me the next day and got some ""high as a kite"" executive who was literally driving down the California coast in a convertible. I could hardly hear her but she insisted that she would help me and that I needed to send the ""pebble"" to her. I took down her address and she said that she would send me a couple of coupons for me and my family. She told me that it wasn't unheard of to have a potato grow around a pebble (???). I never heard of this and I must say in all the years of eating potatoes I've never had this issue. Needless to say I sent off the pebble and never heard back from her. I tried to call the same number several times but with caller ID she was obviously screening her calls. Good for her. She did her job for the corporation, but lost an entire family of previous followers. To be honest, it was the way I was treated which pissed me off.

110,Thysis R.,"Orlando, FL",182,238,734.0,4.0,2014-05-25,We visited this location to celebrate my Goddaughters graduation. We had a party of 12 and had to wait for about an hour and a half. Reason being is because they weren't accepting reservations.  We were finally seated and greeted by our waiter who appeared to have a lot of enthusiasm. He quickly took our drink orders and asked if we wanted appetizers. We declined appetizers but asked for a couple of bread baskets. I have to say that their honey wheat bread seemed to be the favorite for everyone.  I ended up getting a blueberry Mojito which was quite tasty. I will say I'm usually not a fan of Cheesecake Factory because I feel totally overwhelmed with their menu but they make a great Mojito. I ended up ordering the fried MacNCheese balls with marinara sauce. I only wanted something small at this point since we were seated a little late in the evening.  My order came out and it was 4 perfectly fried balls of MacNCheese. They were so good! The inside was creamy and not too overpowering. I have to say it was a really nice combination of cheeses that went very well with the marinara sauce. I was only able to eat 2 of them as I was pretty full.  I opted out on the best part...cheesecake but one of my friends got the cherry cheesecake. Yes I did take a bite and it was delicious. All I needed was just a couple of bites and I was happy. This visit was one of the better visits that I have had at this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park?start=100,2.8,2.8,2.8,3.12,2.8

It was a Friday evening around 7:45 p.m. I expected the place to be packed, and while it was crowded, our wait for a table of two was only about 5 minutes. Our table was tight. We were sandwiched between two other tables (very European bistro style). It was a little uncomfortable. The main dining room (there's another space off to the side) was very noisy and dim - a double whammy. I couldn't see to read the voluminous menu, and couldn't hear my dining companion tell me what was on it. Speaking of the menu, for the few who haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory before, the menu is the length of a small book. They serve a variety of cuisine (Italian, Mexican, Chinese, American, etc.) in jumbo-sized portions. The food is good, for large chain fare. We had two different pasta dishes, both were fine. No dessert, as we were in a rush to catch a movie.

With all of the great local restaurants in Orlando, why would someone eat here?  I understand the excitement created by the name but at the end of the day, who has any room in their stomach for cheesecake after the ginormous meals their serve here?!  However, my hubby requested it for lunch so I was willing to go and give it a chance yet again. The theme here seems to be ""bigger is better.""  The menu is ridiculously overwhelming and there is really no organization as the lunch specials are towards the end. And I think the ads in the menu are super duper tacky!  Food was ok. We were brought out a complimentary basket of bread and butter. Our tex mex eggrolls were good. I enjoyed the pico de gallo that I used as a topping to give it that ""kick"" it needed. My chicken salad sandwich was insanely huge. And I was let down that it was more of a pressed sandwich on Texas type toast . Blergh. I probably ate a few bites of one HALF before giving up. The buttered toast with the creaminess of the chicken salad was just too rich and it was too much all at once.  My husband had the California cheesesteak and it was smaller than my entire meal! I did enjoy his Flying Gorilla cocktail. If you are going to drink your calories, this is a good way to start. Think chocolate, banana, whipped cream, alcohol. Yumm! Service was good. Our server was attentive and did his duties but more in a robotic way. He had no personality ,which in this establishment is what sets you apart.  It was definitely all business.  In a nutshell, I wouldn't discourage anyone from coming here. It's not the worst place in the world but just not where I would choose to spend my hard earned $$.

We were tucked away in a weird area if the restaurant, but we didn't complain. Waitress was not very attentive. Maybe because we were seated in such a weird area she just forgot about us. Took her a long time to take our order and bring us bread. I got a skinny flatbread which was very good. Boyfriend got chicken and biscuits, which is normally one of our favorites. They were out of mashed potatoes so he agreed to breakfast potatoes, which were literally the worst breakfast potatoes either of us have ever had. Dry, way way oversalted, and not hot. Seemed like he got the dredges leftover from brunch. There was a large party seated at the table next to us, and we noticed it took them forever to get their food as well.

We had the cuban egg rolls for an appetizer. They were okay, there wasn't a lot of the pork in them and they were a little greasy, the dipping sauce was just okay and kind of non descript. My wife had the shepherd's pie which was okay. with decent flavor, but the pieces of beef were kind of tough and slightly overcooked. I tried the stuffed tamales which were kind of cold with slightly overcooked chicken and too sweet black beans and too sweet corn cakes. So, overall, the food quality has kind of gone down a little, unless it was just the choices we happened to make. Service was pretty good even though they were pretty busy. The banana cream cheesecake was very tasty, if not quite as creamy as I remembered. I would recommend the cheesecake factory with reservations. Try and go during an off time when it is not quite so busy and stick with the Italian or Asian style dishes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park?start=140,3.36,3.39,3.39,2.544,3.378

I rarely eat at Macaroni Grill. In fact, this was my first time. I had to go for an office gathering. The food here at Bennigan's was almost tasty. Hard to complain when everything is marinated in butter. Maybe it seems like I want to complain. I do. Chain restaurants displease me for all their sterile homogeneity. This Applebees is no different.  This Yard House seems to go for high-brow atmosphere at $$ (the high end of $$) prices. Though the decor is tacky, who the fuck really cares? TGIFridays was absolutely crawling with employees. Must have been 30 in that place for lunch. Even so, we were saying ""where's the guy"" a lot. Here at Bonefish Grill, getting drinks or dessert is a mistake at $6 apiece. If you're going with the office, nurse your Coke Zero and be glad you're getting paid to dine there. That reminds me. Besides getting paid to do it, I can't imagine wilfully dining at this or any Red Lobster.

For a place that has a menu as long as the declaration of independence they pretty much do all their food justice. It's just hard to make a decision of what you want if you come in without an idea...so perhaps dp not bring an indecisive date here haha. From pizzas to salads to seafood to steak to chicken to pasta to cheescake, there is something for everyone craving FOOD in general.  My husband got a personal pizza and salad ($13 lunch special) and I got their spicy chicken chipotle pasta ($16 for the dinner portion). I love how they give you the option to pay a little bit less for a lunch sized portion, but I usually order the dinner size and take the rest to go for another meal later because I love leftovers. Honestly...most times at the cheesecake factory, I never order cheesecake because it's a little pricey for just one slice, but I'm sure it's very gpod. I wanted to today, but was so full after the food because of the big portions that I couldn't even imagine eating anything else. We opted for drinks with our lunches instead of an appetizer and the hubby ordered a Caribbean Cooler and I ordered the Flying Gorilla (under blended drinks section). No price on the drinks...but be aware they ran $11 a pop. Don't feel the price was worth it for my husband's drink because it was small, but I love the flying gorrilla which was dark chocolate liquer and banana...so delicious and they give you lots!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park?start=100,3.4,3.4,3.4,2.416,3.4000000000000004

Loved the Cheesecake Factory in the past and we were excited to return, but after our experience tonight I am done! So the wait was more than an hour and a half which I expected for Valentines Day, but then I inquired about the bar tables. The  server said we could eat at the high top tables on a first come first serve basis. Everyone ahead of us was very respectful and as tables became available, we sat in the order in which we arrived, but then a young family decided they were going to sit at the next table ahead of those that had been waiting. Needless to say there was a verbal altercation. What was very disappointing, was that the waiter, Louis, got involved and stated ""I get to choose who sits where"" and accommodated the rude couple ahead of those of us who were waiting. Thank goodness the manager stepped in and straightened things out. From there, the visit went down hill. The food was mediocre and our waiter was rude! His name was Tony. Truly a disappointing visit.

That being said our waiter, Tony, is probably the most arrogant person I have ever had wait on me. My Cheesecake Factory experience has been completely ruined by him. Not only did I receive a few eye rolls but also some serious attitude just from asking a few simple questions. But hey he's obviously trying to work towards a zero dollar tip. He has completely ruined my families Valentine's Day dinner and if I was management I would get rid of this employee asap because he's pushing away paying customers.

The other positive thing is that the portions are big. You can't go to the cheesecake factory without having dessert. I picked the Lemon meringue cheesecake. It was delicious. The service was not that great either. It was not that busy. Half of our table got their drinks while the other half was waiting on water..(yes water).

At this particular location, it was not busy when we arrived at about 6pm but by the time we left at 7:30, there was probably a 10-20 minute wait. All of the bussers, servers, & food runners  truly worked as a team & that was nice to see. The bussers help the servers pre-bus the table & when a table got up, the bussers were there to clear the table, clean it, & set it immediately. The server we had, Will, was very personable & took great care of my grandfather & myself. I ordered the Miso Salmon & got macaroni & cheese instead of white rice because it was a cheat day!! The fish was cooked perfectly & the macaroni & cheese was sooo good because it's the perfect combination of cheesy & had a great crust on top. The sauce for the fish which is sake butter & miso glaze was definitely not the flavor profile it should've been though & it tasted completely off. My grandfather ordered the Fried Catfish & it was served with mashed potatoes, green beans, & giblets of corn. The sauce it came with was a spicy tartar, perhaps some type remounted even & it was nice but too spicy for my grad father but he loved the fish & the mashed potatoes. My grandfather always goes out to eat & orders a dry Rob Roy with a twist of lemon & it's pretty much NEVER accurate, but by some miracle...it was perfect!!! We were too full for dessert so we didn't order any, but I have had every single cheesecake over the years & I have many that I love but I'd say my top 5 are: Chocolate Tuxedo Cream, White Chocolate Raspberry (I don't even like white chocolate & it's that good), Adam's Peanut Butter Fudge Cup Ripple, Godiva, & Lemon Raspberry Cream. Don't get me wrong though, the Dulce de Leche with bits of almond toffee  on the whipped cream, Banana Cream, & Pumpkin when it's in season are damn good!

However, last night we tried their Buffalo Chicken Meatballs and they were awesome. They were scoops of chopped buffalo-chicken which were battered, fried and served with a blue cheese dip; they were addictive.  Our favorite entrees are their Chicken Di Pana, Caramel Chicken, Orange Chicken, Spicy Cashew Chicken and the Monte Cristo Sandwich.

We ordered their Crispy Spicy Chicken Sandwich (perfectly fried breast, pepper jack cheese topped off with buffalo sauce served on a brioche bun) with a side of blue cheese and a green salad. They absolutely know how to cook chicken; it was a perfect sandwich. We did have to ask for an extra order of buffalo sauce, but only because we like our food on the spicy side.

Both there orders we delivered with under cooked macaroni, I also received the wrong item. Nicholas was very apologetic about the mistake and the raw macaroni, he told me that he would have the manager come to talk to me. This however never happened, you would expect that the manager of such a nice restaurant would have come to apologize for the mistakes the kitchen has made.

Strangely, I was in the mood for pasta. Normally I wouldn't dine at The Cheesecake Factory, but it was right there and an easy choice. I don't dislike The Cheesecake Factory - it's been decent the few times I've been. But I'm basically a food snob who doesn't like going to national chain restaurants. We asked for a table outside and were seated right away. There were actually several things on the menu that caught my eye, but I decided to stick with pasta. I ordered the pasta with shrimp and sausage. While the menu does mention ""mildly spicy peppers"", the dish was much spicier than I expected. I would not describe it as mildly spicy. Despite the heat, I enjoyed the flavor so I just kept eating and didn't feel a need to send it back, although I did also think the pasta wasn't quite al dente enough. The portion size was decent. At first it seemed a bit less than what I expected for $17.95, but I did have enough leftover to make a small meal the next day. My boyfriend had the crispy Cuban rolls, and of course I got to try a bite. The wrapper was nice and crisp and overall it was a unique and tasty twist on an egg roll. He purposely ordered just an appetizer in order to save room for some cheesecake. He chose the Oreo dream extreme cheesecake. The cheesecake was not as heavy and dense as I expected, but I was still satisfied with just a bite. Service started out pretty well. The server even asked if we wanted another bread basket. But toward the end of the meal the server kind of disappeared. I think he was more focused on prep work for the next day, than checking on his customers. Despite the service, I left with a more positive impression of The Cheesecake Factory than when I went in. I wouldn't make a trip to Winter Park Village just to go there, but I'm open to going back if we're already in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park?start=20,3.2,2.97,2.97,2.9560000000000004,3.0620000000000003

I never thought you could mess something up so simple like a waffle, but oh they did. It was super soggy by the time I got the dish and the taste was nothing like a waffle but rather a donut taste. It was way too sweet for the overall meal. Then the chicken! No not your delicious fried chicken that you normally get with waffle and chickens, instead it was chicken strips with breading that once again was soggy, not crispy at all and tasted like a frozen chicken strip you buy from the frozen section at publix. The hollandaise sauce on the poached eggs was equally awful. Overall do not recommend this dish to anyone- even though when I ordered it my waiter said ""oh that's a great choice""- not sure why he would need to lie. My husband had the beef tip sandwich and didn't even finish it. When my husband leaves food on a plate, that's an immediate sign that the food is not worth it since he normally eats anything and always has a huge appetite.

It was not okay for Cheesecake Factory last night. It was cold in there.  Only difference between being there and being outside was the windchill.  Other diners were cold judging by the number of people who had left their jackets on.  I left my jacket on, we put her jacket back on our daughter.  This made for a less than stellar dining experience.  Told our server, she said she didn't feel cold as she was always on the move.  That does not help the situation your diners are in at all.  No offer to let management know or do anything about the cold dining room. Before we ordered, our server scored some solid points by bringing out a separate bread and banana dish for our 1.5 year old.  We didn't ask, she just did it.  In speaking with her, she said she had a couple of young children herself and though that might be a way to have the child enjoy the dining experience.  It did help a lot. I ordered the meatloaf and my wife ordered a chicken pasta dish.  Plates came out in about 15 minutes, not too long of a wait, they were somewhat busy last night.  We waited for our table for about 15 minutes or so. I enjoyed my meatloaf with mashed potatoes and corn succotash.  The gravy is a brown gravy instead of a tomato based sauce.  It's one of my favorite meals from Cheesecake Factory. Wife enjoyed her dish as well but the portions were a bit small.  My portion was quite large, so large in fact that I had about 1/4 of the meatloaf left which I brought home. We finished our meal off with strawberry topped cheesecake, it's our favorite and I believe one of their best sellers.  The server brought some ice cream with chocolate syrup and sprinkles for our little one.  Again, we didn't ask, it's just something she did and it was greatly appreciated. To summarize, we wish something was done about the temperature.  The actions of our server boosted the rating to 3 stars.  Otherwise it would've been 2 stars.  5 stars is reserved for the places with a combination of incredible food, incredible service and an incredible atmosphere.  This place has potential but it didn't meet it this time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park,3.32,3.1,3.1,2.7640000000000002,3.1880000000000006

Potatoes were almost cold.  I ordered chicken fettuccine Alfredo, which, according to the menu, has a creamy sauce.  I was unfortunately very disappointed with this dish.  I would prefer Fazoli's fettuccine Alfredo over this.  I had to add salt to it twice because it had no flavor at all, and the sauce was anything but creamy, it was barely there.  I felt like I paid $19 for some plain boiled noodles.  I had the same dish at Bella Italia last night, and Cheesecake Factory should go try their Alfredo to learn what the word ""creamy"" means.  I didn't bother sending the dish back or complaining about it.  It was at least edible once I salted it, I didn't know if I might get something worse picking from other dishes on the menu, and I didn't want to wait again for a new dish.  I would still try this restaurant again, but I'd like some suggestions as to what's good, so I know what to get and what to avoid.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park?start=120,3.36,3.08,3.08,2.604,3.1920000000000006

I did reach out to the manager and he stated that it was not handled correctly.  They are sending out a gift card for a future visit as an apology as the manager can only do so much being after the fact.  But I can truly say I would have rather my kid got the birthday celebration, especially at her age.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park?start=20,3.32,3.05,3.05,2.44,3.158

When the sandwich arrived at my table it was extremely soggy and held together with toothpicks. I shrugged it off and took a bite and realized it was extremely chewy. I assumed I had a piece of fat in my mouth until the next bite was just as chewy with an odd taste. Because of the dark lighting in the restaurant I wasn't able to see that the beef on my sandwich was almost entirely raw. I literally took out my phone to shine a light on it and was disgusted by what I saw. I cannot believe that someone put that meat on a bun and sent it out to be eaten. I was refunded when my waitress saw the raw meat, which I do appreciate, but I have been nauseous ever since I left the restaurant early this afternoon which is why I am writing this review.

67,Rachael H.,"Sanford, FL",223,91,450.0,3.0,2017-07-25,"The Cheesecake Factory is a great place to visit if you are looking for all American Fare and drinks :-)  And YESSS on a good day their service is great and you will have your food in a timely manner and have a great experience! Unfortunately, The Cheesecake Factory is a nationwide restaurant and the service can be hit or miss. At this location it has also been a hit or miss.  The hostesses are usually very nice and I have had an array of different servers. This time we had Christina and she was marvelous! They give you delicious bread, white and a the sweet brown bread which is my favorite!  Usually when you go at night time within two hours of closing I notice the service to be less than par and it is super packed! They also do not take reservations so you can be waiting for over an hour.  I recommend going for lunch time. The staff is more lively and and the food seems more fresh. The prices are reasonable for a date night or going out with your friends. The dress is casual or dressy casual.  I order the same meal everytime I go the ""Crusted Chicken Romano"" and I LOVE IT  and it is consistently good everytime. Try the mango strawberry drink, I forgot what it's called but it is sooo good and taste just like mango! And of course I have to talk about the cheesecake! Yes it is amazing and delicious goodness! My favorites are the strawberry, banana cream and Oreo. There are so many flavors and they are huge servings. Their whipped cream is the best I've ever had.  All in all, yes I do recommend The Cheesecake Factory. The service is not 100% but the food is good, nothing too fancy but good and the cheesecake is a must have!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park,2.68,3.11,3.11,3.0520000000000005,2.9379999999999997

I went for lunch today with work colleagues. I was able go get a table quickly. The waiter was attentive and helpful. I had the Louisiana Chicken pasta which was delicious. I have probably had all of their pastas in my lifetime. Certainly recommend the Crusted Chicken Romano as one of my favorites. I love the complementary bread also. My favorite cheesecake is probably the 30th anniversary. But i love all the chocolate ones. This location gets crazy packed on the weekends so be prepared for that. I have heard that evenings are also very busy. There is a lot of parking but even with that it is often difficult to find a parking spot. It is certainly worth it though.

Let me say I understand Sunday afternoon lunch will be busy and there will be delays and my wife and I were prepared for that. Now that said we were not prepared for the substandard service and food.  While there was almost an hour wait at 12:30 we decided to sit in the bar area. After sitting for almost 15 mins I had to flag someone down to get our waiter.  Ordered iced tea and before I could include an appetizer our server was gone. 10 minutes later iced tea shows up and before we could order our server was off to another table. 12 minutes later ( yes by this point I was timing things ) our waiter comes back and ask if we have any questions to which I answered ""we've been here over 30 minutes and except for iced tea no one has stopped by, dropped bread off or anything so we are ready to order"" We ordered an appetizer and I ordered the Chinese chicken salad without the rice noodles on top. I also asked for some bread. 12 minutes later our server walks by with 3 baskets of bread and i thought for sure one was ours but boy was i wrong. 8 minutes later I had to yell at our server to get his attention and ask for bread which showed up 5 minutes later. If you are keeping score that's 62 minutes before we even got bread.  Our meals showed up 17 minutes later. Never saw the appetizer and the server and helpers looked confused. My salad had a big pile of rice noodles but no wonton noodles. Sent it back and when it came back the rice noodles were gone but the wonton noodles were still missing. I didnt dare ask for it to be fixed.  No one seemed to care. Not the server, helper or manager.  Don't know that we are going back and that's a disappointment because we used to lover the place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park?start=20,2.72,3.14,3.14,,2.9720000000000004

My wife and I visited this location for the first time on Saturday.  The facility was clean and in a newer shopping area.   When we got our appetizer the avocados were not ripe at all and the dipping sauce was extremely watered down.  The salt shakers at all the tables nearby were completely clogged, which they said they knew it was humidity and never brought us a new one.   My wife's lettuce wraps were made with aging vegetables.  The lettuce and bean sprouts were turning brown.  The cucumbers were almost translucent and wilted .  It would have been edible, but clearly not what you would expect to be served at an upscale restaurant.  She asked it be returned and just have something else. I ordered the classic cheeseburger and my lettuce was more cabbage than lettuce, so I asked the waiter about it and had they include cabbage in the lettuce blend.  Instead of offering to get me lettuce he argued with me about and walked away rolling his eyes.  Seriously though who wants raw cabbage on your cheeseburger.  Since I still had the menu it said it comes with lettuce, not a lettuce ""blend.""  I basically didn't eat my burger because it was so greasy. The manager came to our table since we had returned a dish out of what felt like obligation.  I explained we had come here for our anniversary and were overall disappointed in our experience.  He gave lip service and then disappeared.   I paid my bill (no discounts) and did not order dessert, which was the main reason we had come.  I would never eat at this branch again and I would advise anyone reading this to do the same.  There is a better branch not much farther away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park,2.72,3.12,3.12,,2.9600000000000004

Was informed that Happy Hour started at 4, so we could wait or order from the regular menu. Ordered the Truffle Cheese Sticks assuming they were going to be like cheese sticks you dip with marinara but instead got cheese paninis with bacon? Also ordered the Mini Crab Bites(6) and 2 slices of cheesecake. We got the Oreo Dream Cheesecake and the Chris's Cheesecake. Loved the crushed Oreos with the Oreo cheesecake, and the Chris's Cheesecake tasted exactly like an Almond Joy! The cheesecakes overall were good for the price, you can easily split 1 slice between 2-3 people. However, this is a 3-star review due lack of cleanliness. When I sat down, I noticed that my spoon and one of my forks were dirty. There was a large reddish/brown stain that clearly didn't get cleaned off the spoon, and white spots all over my fork. It looked like someone had just eaten from the spoon and it was put back on the table. The server exchanged my silverware for a new set, but my appetite was kind of ruined for the rest of the meal.

We get there, sit in the bar area, and are greeted by our server. I get a Coke Zero because I was dragging and needed caffeine. My girlfriend gets a fancy drink. I forget which one, but she said it was good.  We think that ordering three appetizers to split between the two of us was going to be fine, and it was fine, but it was more than fine. Meaning, these $6 appetizers were actually much, much larger than we expected them to be. It was a pleasant surprise, don't get me wrong. We just had to scarf it all down, because we didn't want to leave leftovers in the car during the movie. More of a me problem. Let's get to the food. From worst to first. When I say worst, nothing was actually bad here. It was all pretty great. Warm Crab & Artichoke Dip (A Delicious Blend of Crab, Artichokes and Cheese. Served Warn with Grilled Bread). Wow. This was so crabby. They didn't skimp on it in this dish. Every bite was super flavorful and creamy. I have a tip, though. Save some of that complimentary bread from the beginning of your meal, because they definitely don't give you enough grilled bread to make the dip last. Then, the ""Happy Hour Burger"" (Double Patties, Double Cheese, Grilled Onions and Special Sauce on a Toasted Brioche Bun). This thing was shockingly large. This is a burger I would pay $12 for at Burger U. Here, it was $6. Crazy. It was actually cooked nicely, too. Not dry or anything. I didn't notice anything truly special about the sauce. Also, the bun is brioche, so it might be a little oily for some people's tastes, but I didn't mind.  The best thing that we ate, hands down, was the Southern Fried Chicken Sliders (Crispy Fried Chicken Breast on Mini-Buns. Served with Lettuce, Tomato and Pickles). The sides are served on the side, so you get to build your own sliders. It also comes with two sauces, a tangy thousand island-type sauce and mayo. The chicken was cooked so well. SO well. It was nice and crispy on the outside, and there was actually enough meat on the insider for me to tell that it was nice and juicy. That's not something I'm used to from chicken sliders.  Overall, this was a great meal for an even better price. I know this place has a reputation for being overpriced and overly unhealthy, but gosh darn it, I enjoyed myself, and I will be back, for happy hour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park,3.04,3.17,3.17,,3.118

It was to late to go somewhere else so we stuck it out. Granted, we had a large group, seven adults and two children. I will say though, there was zero attempt to create a secondary space for us to eat. It was this table, or nothing. We were even told that the party in table was getting their dinner so it would be a little longer. Once we were sat, service was prompt to the table and drinks were ordered. Then, more waiting. I finished my drink and ordered another. Out server did mention that it was in fact a double as I had ordered, it was just in a small glass. As if I drank too much. Then, guess what? More waiting. Food was delivered in waves. Two plates came, about thirty minutes after ordering and more filtered out. They are still arriving as I type this. What food that is here, looks good. Mine is still somewhere out there. Well, that's about all I can say. Gonna try the food, I don't have to be at work until tomorrow, so we might get dessert. UPDATE: my pasta was ill described on the menu, it was not really what I expected. It also seemed to have sat in the window for quite some time. UPDATE II : The wait continues!!

They have quick sit down service unless you choose to get in sooner and sit at the high tops or bar area, woo!!! Secret secret ?? Those are always sit down anywhere you like and gives you better and faster service.

The caramel pecan wasn't bad, but I would suggest they tweak the way they prepare it to make it even better.

I don't know, the ridiculously complex menu, the faux-Egyptian decor, the bread basket (#brownbread4lyfe)...the whole experience is slightly surreal and makes me ridiculously happy! Going to The Cheesecake Factory isn't just a meal, it's an event! Anyway, my love for TCF aside I am sad to report that this location isn't the best. It's definitely less crowded than other outposts (particularly the one at Millennia which is just bonkers 24/7), so that's a plus. Staff is generally nice, but the attention to detail just isn't there. Part of the charm(?) of TCF is that the food should be consistent and pretty high quality every time, but it seems like orders always come out slightly off: cold fries, forgot the cheese, gave my friend's steak to someone else. Once we asked for the bread basket to be all brown bread and they brought us all sourdough. I mean, they could have just said ""no""....

I am kind of surprised at all the bad reviews as we've had nothing but pleasant experiences each time we've visited. This last visit was a Friday night and we were told there was a 45 minute wait (not horrible).  So we broke our evening down like this, and it worked out perfectly: We made our way to the bar and while waiting for a drink 2 people left and we were able to take their seats, score! While sipping on some wine we decided we were a little hungry and ordered 2 small plates, the dynamite shrimp and crab cake bites. Both were delicious and perfect size for just us two! Shortly after finishing our appetizers our buzzer went off and our table was ready! Our waitress was sweet and attentive. My husband ordered the pasta Alfredo with chicken on the side (he's just picky like that) and I ordered the crispy chicken costoletta with sautéed spinach and mashed potatoes. We didn't really need to but who can resist their delicious bread?? By the time we finished our entrees came out. My husband loved his pasta! I was amazed that my dish came with 3 pieces of chicken -- holy leftovers! The lemon butter sauce was delicious so of course I had to ask for more to accompany my chicken (as well as to take home).  So by this time you're probably thinking how could we eat any more?? But yes we had to share a slice of cheesecake. Now remember, their small plates aren't that heavy so you can get that, eat 1/4-1/2 of your dinner, and still get dessert (shoot I had a couple bites and had to take the rest home). They were running a little low on choices however they had their Celebration cheesecake which was PERFECT for me! It had just the right amount of cheesecake, vanilla cake, and mousse in it.

We checked in and waited easily over an hour to be seated and attended to which is not great when it's a birthday party situation. Even when we were finally seated the timing of the service was off.

23,David M.,"Colonialtown North, Orlando, FL",17,1,,2.0,2018-01-05,"Absolute disappointment. I've eaten at many Cheesecake Factories, but I have never had such an awful experience as I had at this location. My entree, which was a chicken dish, was poorly prepared and undercooked. How is it possible that a restaurant chain known for their quality and standardization can mess up a chicken dish? I found myself spitting bits of chicken out because they were so disgusting. To top things off, the bathroom was absolutely abominable. The sink was overflowing and dripping water onto both my fur coat and the floor. What an incredible disappointment. Both the head chef and the store manager should be ashamed of themselves for such poor quality. The only redeeming part of my dining experience (and the only reason I am giving two stars) was that the server was lovely--proving old adage that Cheesecake Factory hires (and underpays for that matter) fantastic front-facing employees. I will never return to this location, and I hope you won't make the same mistake I did. Truly, a dismal restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park?start=20,3.28,3.16,3.196,,3.2080000000000006
