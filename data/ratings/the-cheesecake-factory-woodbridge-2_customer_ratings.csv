205,Greg S.,"Woodbridge, VA",42,22,1.0,5.0,2012-12-08,"This restaurant just opened in Nov 2012 and I've already been here four times. My first visit wasn't so spectacular as the server struggled and took too long to take orders/deliver drinks and she lacked good communication skills. I haven't seen her there on my subsequent visits so I'm either missing her or she is no longer serving there. I've written that experience off as grand opening pains as the service since then has been perfect. Matt is AMAZING. If you're planning to visit this place ask to sit in his section and you'll receive the best service you could hope for.  The food is always fresh (never frozen except for the cheesecakes), staff is attentive, and oh those oversized servings delievered to your table in a beautifully decorated and rich environment. It's among the best chain restaurants out there and it's great to have one minutes from home. The prices are very good for the amount of food and atmosphere provided (12-30 range per entry) Tip, it's always crowded so I go an hour early to put a name on the list and then shop at the mall while waiting. It's much more enjoyable this was than waiting in the overcrowded lobby which isn't large enough to accomodate so many people at once.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-woodbridge-2?start=180,3.3160000000000003,3.3160000000000003,3.3160000000000003,3.3160000000000003,3.3160000000000007

So, I expected that the opening of a new restaurant such as CF would cause lots of commotion and ridiculousness... and boy, I was right! I went in the week it opened and asked what the wait time was... 90 MINUTES!!!  People were waiting to eat at a CHAIN restaurant for NINETY FREAKING MINUTES!!!  Ridiculous! So then I had a day off.  And I decided...hmmm... maybe the kids and I can make it in with a less ridiculous wait time.  30 minutes.  Eh, it was 4 in the afternoon so I didn't mind waiting.  Now, onto the service and the food... The service was EXCELLENT hence my four star rating even though CF is a chain restaurant.  Drinks, bread & appetizers came out pretty quickly.  There was a delay with my daughter's kobe burger, but the manager came over to explain that to me and then refilled our drinks and brought more bread.  No big deal. The appetizers... I got both of the tuna appetizers and they were really good.  I can't recall the names of them, but one was smaller with avocado and the other was like a carpaccio - you could just scrape it up with a spoon and eat it.  Really yummy. I had the combination plate of shrimp scampi & steak dianne with mashed potatoes.  I'm used to scampi being just as butter/garlic sauce... this one looks to have had some kind of cream added to it.  It was different, but I liked it.  My daughter liked her burger and my boys had the pizza... which they ravaged! LOL  But hey, it's PIZZA and they are 10 and 5.   Now,  you simply cannot go to CHEESECAKE FACTORY and not try the cheesecake! Even though I was stuffed beyond belief, we got two pieces to share amongst the four of us.  It was the Oreo Cookie thing-a-majig and the banana cream something or other.  I really liked the banana one... it was so much better than the oreo one.  Either way, both got devoured!

The Louisiana chicken pasta (bow tie) replaced with spaghettini was good because the chicken was perfectly cooked crispy and thin and still soft and moist inside as stated above.  Pasta was on the dry side with minimal flavors.  I had to add salt to it (never really a good sign as I don't eat much salt) to make it more palatable.  Others in my party substituted the pasta with rice.   The Chargrilled Coulette Steak which is sirloin steak.  It was decent but slightly dry.   The best part of the meal was the FRESH BANANA CREAM CHEESECAKE! You can't go to Cheesecake Factory and not get cheesecake! That's like going to Macaroni Grill and not get the Macaroni...oh wait............ Anyway, The Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake is amazing!

That problem is even worse at the Potomac Mills location because of its size. It is much smaller than most Cheesecake Factories which makes the wait times much longer. We never even attempt to sit in the dining area (and we probably never will). Instead, we go to the bar area so we can start our meal immediately. But even the bar area has had a wait every time we've been. People literally hover around people's tables/behind their seat at the bar, waiting for them to finish their meal and get up. I have been guilty of this as well, but it's still unpleasant. I give this location 3 stars just because Cheesecake Factory's menu is so expansive and varied. I love getting a few small plates to share and topping it off with one of their cheesecakes.

It doesn't help that this location is smaller than the Fairfax and Tyson's location, but there's nothing they can do about that now.  Since they don't take reservations, I'd recommend to call ahead to at least ask approximately how long the wait will be (and see if you're up for the wait). I've gone there too many times on a hungry stomach and almost passed out waiting! lol  If you've been to a Cheesecake Factory before, then you know what to expect.

AND the portions are consistently ENORMOUS. We recently had dinner at the new Potomac Mills store and it was an overall good experience.  Server (Jorge) was attentive and personable and made us feel welcome and special.  However he didn't know the difference between Black tea (strong, iced) and Raspberry Tea (weak, iced) OR someone mixed up the tea dispensers, not sure but we switched to water and soda - when the bill came he forgot to remove one of the $2.95 teas (a bit pricey!) so that created considerable confusion, but we got it worked out. The food we ordered was good.  I had a mushroom burger (okay, but not really special) - I also opted for a salad, thinking it would a garden salad, it was however more of a spinach salad and I didn't care for it (that's just my taste) BUT the honey mustard dressing was great! My wife got the meatloaf sandwich and it was HUGE - way too much to eat after having a Nacho's appetizer so she took half of it home for lunch the next day.   Great taste... Overall, Cheesecake Factory is typically a very good, fairly priced place to eat with quality food.  You will not leave there hungry and if you do, it's your fault, not theirs.   If you really want to experience the ultimate burger, get the Mac 'n Cheese burger and you will be able to say you have a unique experience - it is exceptional but probably about 2000+ calories!!

Service was good even though the place is jam packed. I have never once waited for a glass refill or wondered ""Where in the world is our waitress?""

She thinks tomatoes are spicy, medium would have been better, very fresh, tasty, and large. The crab wontons also good but not quite there, worthy trying but not amazing, standard and small, although you get about 10. I had the Baja Fish Tacos , fish was cod and very blah, served on soft tortilla with cabbage, cream and one small (tiny) slice of avacodo. Could have used pico or something, the tempura was strange and I opted for grilled, possibly should have gone for fried.  Cheesecake is very good, took some to come for the rest of my brood, but $8 a slice is excessive. Total meal for four with two sodas, one pina colada, one beer, two apps, one filet, fish tacos, fish and chips, omelete, and two pieces of cheesecake totaled $137.00, not bad.

This location suffers bad from size and location.  The wait here is usually atrocious especially if you show up on the weekend.  Day, or night it doesn't matter.  You show up at this location, you are going to wait for a seat. The food there is pretty good, not one of a kind excellent - but perfect for finding a spot that is a cut above the ordinary, but substantially under super expensive.  If you want to find a place that looks and feels ""high end"" and no one can decide what kind of food they want - this is a solution. Freshly baked bread in a basket is served with every meal and the service is above ordinary.  Typical wait service for a higher end restaurant, the servers recite the specials of the day and offer suggestions according to customer input.  Our waiter was very attentive and made several return trips to make sure we were ok. We started off sharing a mango Daiquiri.  It was a delicious fruit-inspired quencher that was tangy yet sweet and had only a hint of the taste of spirits.  I  sampled the Famous Factory Meatloaf and found it done well, but not as good as I had hoped - certainly not good enough to be characterized as ""famous"".   My wife had the Fettuccine w/ Chicken & Sun Dried Tomatoes.  What came was a bowl full of wide egg noodles with a light glaze, chicken breast and a hint of dried tomato slices.  Again, while the dish was good, it was nothing special...but at the same time I can't say that it was bad either. As the name suggests, the best thing they do is cheesecake.  These delicious concoctions need no review so I will not even touch on them.  Let's just say we ordered three slices of different varieties and it erased the bland dinner experience to the point that I almost forgot to review the sum of the entire visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-woodbridge-2?start=100,3.56,3.56,3.56,2.9880000000000004,3.5600000000000005

We DID NOT ask her how long we had waited ! We asked her specifically HOW MUCH LONGER before our pagers may alert us (including the other folks waiting). The husband of the the other party - who were waiting next to us, commented to his wife the same I did to my daughter about the ""greeting"" hostess at the entrance. We couldn't help to converse with the couple after especially when she said THE SAME THING to my daughter later ! The food is tasty, daughter treated me & her daughter (my grand of course) to a delicious meal last week, after a wait of over an hour and a half. I ordered the Cajun Shrimp & Chicken Linguine, after we were seated (we were seated in an ""ok"" area but it was near a chilly entry/exit door, had to wear my jacket - even though we asked our attentive hostess/waitress to try to adjust the temperature(s) to no avail. Guess it was due to that door opening and closing. Because we had no other choice after the lengthy wait for a better area. I was disappointed in the actual amount of the meal, however, the plate itself was ENORMOUS ! So large, that the comparatively tiny amount of food was not warm to my liking. Also, there were only about maybe 6 small shrimp and the same amount of small pieces of chicken (tasty as they were) . Definitely not enough to share happily, but I was able to let my daughter & my G-Daughter have a little ""bite"". As far as their desserts, I personally don't like anything but authentic New York style cheesecake, which has a definite unlikeness in consistency & taste to the Cheesecake Factory brand. So unfair as it may, maybe I should not speak on it. But, I definitely consider Cheesecake Factory's desserts to be WAY overpriced for the size of the slice(s) or full-size cakes, etc...Suggest they close to renovate (if space is available) to build a larger place, train their greeters/seaters to be more polite in addressing the patrons' concerns & questions about the wait times. Our waitress was very nice, pleasant, personable & attentive - , we truly appreciated it in this day & age of rushed, purposefully inattentive (they avoid eye-contact, get attitudes when asked to get condiments or re-heat foods, etc.) & rude waiters & waitresses.

One of my friends was on her way, so I called her and asked what she wanted from the happy hour price list. she order 2 pinot vines. all was good. we ordered an appetizer. we received 1 each of the cosmos. Had to track down the waitress to get the second drink. finally got it. But apparently she forgot she already had charged us for the second drink.then we asked for the bill. we got the bill and then we decided to not go to the movie but stay and visit with each. we ordered another drink each. so that is 3 drinks each.but we had been charged for 4 drinks each at this time but .we didnt receive our drinks so i went to the bar and asked the bartender where was our drinks. she said she was about to make them.the bartender again charged us for the same drink. we ordered cheese cake each and the waitress put the wrong cake on the wrong billing and also  served us the wrong cake ( we didn't realize we ate the wrong cake til it was gone ( too good to question it). when we decided it was time to go, we got our bill and I caught that they over charged me 2 cosmos at $11.95 each and my friend also got charged 2x $11.95. i asked that the bill be corrected. the waitress said she would correct it. came back with new bill- no change. asked for the manager and he came and said that we consumed the 11 cosmos and he wouldn't change the bill. i explained that we didn't order 11 cosmos. he said I had been there since 4:30pm and we did order them. I explained that i didnt get there until 5:45pm and could prove it because I called my friend to ask what she wanted from the happy hour price list. he didnt care, he claimed we ordered the drinks and if I didnt pay it, he would elevate the problem to the police!!!! what the Heck!! no customer service- no consideration of the fact that the server didnt take care of it-I had to even go the bartender to get our drinks and she again charged us.he did take off the price of the cheese cake but the drinks were $50.00 not $7.95 that the cake cost.several times he threatened to ""elevate"" ( call the police) the problem if I didnt pay the bill I asked for his business card and he came back with another managers card. I again asked for his card he finally gave me another card but I have no idea if it was his or not. i paid the  bill but left no tip. I want my bill adjusted.

As I looked around the restaurant I counted 4 tables cleaned and available. Still waited 30 minutes to be seated. Minus 1 star just there.  Food: We knew exactly what we wanted to order. (Remember we had 30 minutes to look over the menu) So when our waitress arrived, we ordered right away.  We ordered simple stuff, corn tamales and wings with a side salad. The side salad was good. We've had the corn tamales before at other locations. Oh boy, these were not fresh. I get it, they have a lot of stuff on their menu. Hard to keep everything available. But the corn tamales were old and tasted like such. They had hard tough pieces as if they had been reheated a few times. I was starving. I ate around the hard stuff. Plus the guac & sour cream masked it. Chicken wings are traditionally wet and messy, right!? Yeah - not these.  They had clearly been sitting under a heating lamp for quite a while. Then when you bit into them, blood line. UMM. That is no bueno. So we pointed it out to our waitress, she took back the plate and said she'd have it recooked. (Hmm) Another sever arrived after 10 minutes with just the wings, no dipping sauce, celery, plate. Nada. Our waitress ended up bringing that after. The wings were wings, nothing special. At this point, they've lost 2 additional stars for food alone.   Wait staff: the young lady was nice but over worked. She was waiting on quite a few tables.  She was super nice but stretched thin. When she asked how out food was we were honest about the food; she told her manager.  He quickly approached us about our problems and took off the wings off the check.  Would I go back to this one? Probably not.  Two stars - one for the cheesecake and one for comping us the wings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-woodbridge-2?start=200,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.504,3.2800000000000002

After rushing over from Bonefish Grille (read previous review), we came in to enjoy the brunt end of HH for my birthday. We sat at the bar and a friend waved to the waiter to usher him over to take our orders. Our waiter (I can't remember his name, but he was talk and thin with a pony tail and a pale face).  We all (5 of us) ordered drinks and since it was 6:30p, we ordered in twos. A couple if us, who didn't enjoys Bonefish's offerings, ordered food off the HH menu: corn cakes, southwestern rolls. A few times we looked for our waiter to to ask for things like: place settings (none if us had any) and to reorder. Once we had to stop another waiter to have him grab our waiter for us because we hadn't seen in 20 minutes prior.  At some given point, that annoying ""happy birthday"" song was requested to be sung. Well, minutes ticked on. We were finished eating and drinking and heard happy birthday sung to two other parties. I walked over to the cheesecake bar and chose one (this ain't the first time I didn't get a cake, might as well get it for myself). Finally a friend called over our waiter, ""Excuse me! Excuse me"" the waiter stopped and took one look at her face and said and I quote, ""Ooooooh Shoooooooooooooooooot!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" And walked away. Five minutes later, he came back with he colleagues and a small round of whip cream and chocolate. Really.

132,Chris C.,"Springfield, VA",67,4,,2.0,2014-06-06,"My friends & I last night to celebrate a birthday where we had a rather large party of 13.  We waited about an hour (typical) for the table.  This location has a substantially smaller indoor dining area than the Fair Oaks or White Flint locations BUT they have an outdoor patio! The broiler caught on fire & we were told that the steak & burger wouldn't come. So the 2 people ordered something else but then the steak & burger still came out?  When everyone else had been served, 3 more friends waited 30 minutes for their chicken dishes & a pasta dish! The shrimp pasta was eventually served cold & 2 others still waited on the chicken!  We were seated at 7:45pm, my friends didn't get their food until almost 9!  It was so late & upset that they barely touched their food.  We complained to the manager, who only comped 2 meals & 2 cheesecakes.  ??? There were 3 LATE meals!  We were sympathetic to the waiter, who busted his tail, trying to keep us happy even though he already got his automatic 18% gratuity for the large party. Fortunately, I enjoyed my Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp (not to confused with Bonefish Grill's Bang Bang Shrimp) but managed to only eat half of it.  Hubby ate all of his Shrimp & Chicken Gumbo.   I have visited 3 different CFs in the WDC area & they manage to screw up the dinner order every time!  What's even more pathetic is that I keep going back because it's other people's preferences to go there. The wait is always long (opt to sit at the bar & you'll only wait 20 minutes), the food is overpriced, although portions are large.  Stick to the bar & cheesecakes.  Thought I would test my bartender's knowledge on cocktails so I ignored the fancy mojitos, margaritas & martinis and ordered a Negroni.  The bartender didn't know what it was but she made it perfectly.  I tipped her well for not effing it up.   And is it me or did the cheesecake pieces get smaller?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-woodbridge-2?start=120,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.3760000000000003,3.2800000000000002

165,Julie S.,"Stafford, VA",0,2,,1.0,2014-07-11,"This restaurant chain gives off a facade of upscale dining with a ridiculous menu that is over 10-pages covered with advertisements and the most unpleasant congregation of employees. Cheesecake Factory, please, reevaluate your criteria before sending your waiters/waitresses to work at your establishments.  My friend and I ended up waiting well over the usual wait time for a table at Cheesecake because the host had us waiting for a party of 4. The server brought out 4 plates and 4 drinks even after we told the incompetent employees SEVERAL TIMES that it will just be the 2 of us. The girl who was our server seemed lazy and uninterested being there. She only stopped by our table two times; to order our food and to leave the check. When she left the check she just walked by and slid it on our table without a single word. We had to stop her as she was walking by because my friend ordered a chicken that she felt was a little under cook and the waitress took one of the four appetizer plates that was stacked up at the end of the table and BRUSHED OFF THE BREAD CRUMBS WITH HER HANDS and asks my friend to put the chicken on the plate. Her excuse was, ""OH, IT'S RED LIKE THAT BECAUSE IT'S NEAR THE BONE."" She never came back with the chicken, instead a kitchen boy brought it back BURNT AND FLAKY IN A TAKE OUT BOX after we were close to paying our bill.  The second time was several days ago, for my friend's birthday. We just sat near the bar so we wouldn't have to wait for a table. It was going ok until we met our rather clumsy waitress. She brought our silverware, but no menu, asked if we wanted drinks and bread, but no bread plates. We ended up eating the bread with just our hands. Other guests who came in after us were getting their appetizers way before us. She never came back to refill our drinks, which seems like an on going trend at this place. We had to ask the two servers who brought out the appetizers for plates and refills. That's when our waitress decided to stop by and say thanks to her coworkers who helped and walked on as if we weren't even there. What really annoys me is that we saw about four other birthdays going on and our waitress says, ""so.. are you still interested in something for your birthday? It's just a small cup of dessert that's only enough for two bites.""

I want to say though that the staff response was excellent and that is why CF is still ""A-OK"" in my book. This is the email I sent to corporate this morning. ""First, I would like to start out by saying that my husband and I go to cheesecake factory at least once every month or two and I go with my girlfriends monthly myself. Unfortunately, our meal experience was a disaster last night!!! My food came out more than 15 mins before my husband's food. I slowly ate my food, trying to wait until his came out. It was obviously cold by that time. We ended up missing our movie and having to pay for an extra hour of babysitting. - Disaster! THAT SAID! I am not writing to complain. I am writting to tell you that despite the kitchen error and the resultant set backs, we will still be returning to Cheesecake Factory in Woodbridge.  Our Server - Andre, was friendly and compitent right from the start. The perfect mix of friendly, but not familiar. He made recommendations and gave the appropriate amount of time between check-ins and refills, etc. The problem came when the kitchen plated the wrong order. Andre explained this when he delivered my order. I would have liked the option to have both entrees delievered at the same time, but Im sure he didn't think it would take that long for the second. After several minutes he offered my husband a complimentary soup or salad while he waited, which he declined. After 15 mins, it was obvious that this was a real problem and Andre kindly addressed it and assured us the item would be removed from the bill. Shortly later the manager, Ozzie visited our table to extend his apologies and offered free cheesecake. We told him we were already running late and that was not necessary. He told us that they were open to 11 and that we were welcome to come back after the movie for our cheesecake. When we paid the bill, Ozzie had comped BOTH meals, which we told Andre was unnecessary. He was again gracious and apologetic and told us it was the least they could do. He was impressively polite and humble, explaining that though it was a kitchen mistake it represents him, and he represents CF and wanted to make sure our experience was enjoyable. At 1045 we returned, exhausted and running late for our babysitter. Ozzie met me at the bakery and though he had originally offered one free cheesecake, when I attempted to pay him for the second he declined, again apologizing for our experience. I have never been so impressed with a staff's handling of an inconvenience. They made my husband and I feel appreciated and respected and not like ungrateful, complaining customers.  It is soley due to the response of your server and manager that my husband and I will return to this cheesecake factory.

We weren't even thanked by a single employee as we left. $60 was a large price to pay for such a disappointment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-woodbridge-2?start=220,2.88,2.88,2.88,2.6640000000000006,2.88

All four times; took them at least ten minutes for the waiter/waitress to take our order just for drinks. Then it took another ten minutes just to bring them out. Food came out quicker than our drinks. I have no idea why it takes so long for the drinks, and I'm talking just regular soft drinks; nothing special. Additionally, they don't check back often to see if we are ok, need refills, napkins, etc. Finally, it takes forever to get our checks. All four times these things happened. Seemed like déjà vu.

82,Spencer H.,"Washington, DC",1075,216,854.0,4.0,2014-10-13,"What is Cheesecake Factory? Well let's see. First, it's a restaurant where you can come to when you don't know what you have a taste for OR you have a taste for  everything.. Either way, you're in business. The biggest dilemma you'll have at any Cheesecake Factory is finally deciding on what you're going to eat. From all the restaurants I've had the pleasure to dine at, this by FAR has the most extensive menu. If you want to be trendy and do a ""mezze"" style meal, Cheesecake Factory has more than enough small plate offerings to accomplish this feat. If you want American, Mexican, Italian, seafood, meat and potatoes, Cheesecake Factory has you covered! Today I was trendy and decided to do several small plates so I had the crab and artichoke dip, the dynamite shrimp and the tuna tartare and avocado. I have always enjoyed Cheesecake Factory's food but for some reason I REALLY enjoyed it today.. Everything was great! I really wish Yelp would offer a .5 because this particular Cheesecake Factory would definitely get a 4.5 star. I know from my review you're wondering why didn't I give this place a flat out 5?? Funny you ask.. Lol Well our waiter, who was great, actually brought me crab dip instead of the crab cakes that I asked for but since we were grabbing a bite before a movie date and time was of the essence, I chose to keep the dip and scratch the cakes. I'm a big fan of the dip but my mouth did want the cakes.. Thus the 4!

One included being smothered in onions & mushrooms & mine being just a plain ole steak. Unfortunately, our meals were mixed up & both of our steaks were cooked wrong. We were at least able to switch plates & be happy that way. On the plus side, everything was still super delicious so we didnt bother sending our food back.

Five minutes later a party of two was seated right at the same booth that we had just asked for. The food as always was very good the prices were reasonable we didn't have to wait very long.

The manager basically called me a liar and even though I was fine with the dish continued to make it a point to ensure I felt stupid for even thinking there was a difference in the dish. Absolutely unnecessary and I will not be going back to this location. Than he had the audacity to come back to the table and tell me he felt bad that I was upset saying things like ""I didn't mean to be rude"" and ""I'm not that kind of guy"". I told him I didn't want it to discuss it anymore and simply wanted to leave and he just kept pressing the issue about how he was such a nice guy and I misunderstood him. Obnoxious and rude. The reason that I remembered the original dish so vividly by the way, is because it was one of my first meals I had after my 3rd combat deployment, so I happen to remember it well and Fondly.

I elbowed my way to the hostess stand only to be told that the wait for a table would be at least 40 minutes. SMH... So I elbowed my way back through the crowd and over to the bar, which was also jammed packed with people. There was not a seat to be had nor hardly a place to stand. The only thing that kept me there was my promise to meet my friend. I sucked it up, took a deep breath and waited patiently to bell up to the bar hoping that a libation would take the edge off a smidge. All the while, the restaurant continued to fill with a hoard.  At long last, after over 50 minutes of waiting (I was originally told 40) we were seated. Our server was pleasant and greeted us quickly. He was wonderful, very personable, attentive and quick to deliver. I perused the vast, vast menu with a multitude of items that are almost entirely overpriced. I ordered the loaded baked potato soup and crab bites. Both items were OK, but considering that I lost an hour of my life waiting for a table, not entirely worth it.  We also had pumpkin and red velvet cheesecake and they were delicious but not good enough to warrant the wait.

The complaints were addressed to the waiter and was resolved immediately. Secondly, we're veterans coming to Cheesecake Factory and the first thing they normally provide is their signature warm bread and butter.

First off let me just say that I am a sucker for cheesecake. It is by far my favorite dessert and if I cannot manage to eat a slice I did something wrong. On this occasion I did no wrong. First off we arrived around noon and expected a wait of over 30 minutes and to our surprise it was only 20. We had a party of 5 including 1 child. We were sat in a very spacious booth. I do not believe I have ever sat in a booth where I was not elbow to elbow with the person next to me. I already knew at this point I was going to enjoy this meal.  The service was awesome. The waitress we had (I cant remember her name and I am really bad at this as you see in other posts) was on top of her game. Drinks were filled and food was quick. She was very personable and friendly. She definately worked for her tip. Now onto the fooooood. Appetizers - 2 fried mac and cheese balls orders and 1 buffalo blast. Meals- Some type of chicken and pasta for my friend, his wife had brunch with pancakes and eggs and bacon, my daughter kids quesadilla, my wife a cobb salad and myself a bacon bacon cheeseburger yes thats double bacon! And then there was the cheesecakes but thats later... The fried mac and cheese balls are our go to app. These are addicting and very delicious. The dish comes with 4 balls of mac and cheese on top of a sauce. Once you break a ball open and the mac and cheese pours out into the sauce game on. Each bite makes you want more and for the experience not to end. Highly recommend. The buffalo blast surpringly were really food. They were fried and in the middle was like a buffalo chicken dip. They came with buffalo sauce and blue cheese. They do come with a little extra fried exterior then our liking but I ate every bite I had. They had a nice kick to them. On to the meals. Chicken pasta was massive and friend couldnt finish said it was good but thats all I got out of it. His wife loved the brunch and kept prasing the pancakes. Kids quesadilla was huge! My daughter enjoyed it. My wifes lunch cobb salad was massive! I cant imagine what a dinner sized salad looks like. This salad could be split between 3 people. Now for my bacon bacon cheeseburger which the waitress recommended out of my choices. I got it medium rare which is my go to meat temp. It was so good and juicy. Im salavating right now thinking about it. The 2 different cuts of bacon make the burger. Once was cripsy the other was thick cut and so much flavor. It came with a special sauce which was the icing on the cake. I crushed the burger. O and I got a side salad instead of fries. Balsalmic Vinegarette is my go to and the salad wasnt your tradtional salad you get at most restaurants. Not bad but that burger and the bacon mmmmmmmm I havent even touched on the cheesecake yet. We ended up taking cheesecake to go since we were stuffed. My wife ordered the reeses peanut butter cup and I switch mine up everytime and went with the chocolate chip cookie dough. My wife loved hers and for me.....sigh I wish I didnt eat it so fast... It was soo good. Creamy cheesecake and cookiedough ramdomly placed throughout the slice. I love both. I dont think you can wrong with any of the cheesecakes. I think this is enough of the review. If you made it all the way to this paragraph congrats!

108,Graham B.,"Washington, DC",154,84,,4.0,2015-06-01,"Hungry after a long day of shopping, saw Cheesecake Factory and figured, ""Why not?"" It's the Cheesecake Factory, so you pretty much know what to expect: a phonebook-thick menu full of mostly mediocre offerings, average to above-average service, and really good cheesecake.  My general rule for chain restaurants with huge menus is to play it safe. Stick to the standards as these are the items that are ordered most often; the cooks have the most experience preparing them and the ingredients are likely to be fairly fresh as they have to be reordered regularly. Seafood (that isn't dipped in batter and fried) and pretty much anything healthy are always big no-nos in my book.  My girlfriend followed the play-it-safe rule and ordered the chicken piccata. I, fresh off my shopping high, decided to throw caution to the wind and have the firecracker salmon with a side of sweet potato fries. Almost immediately after placing the order, I began to have second thoughts. (Why didn't I just get the fettuccini alfredo like always?) But when the meals arrived, my fears were allayed.  My dish, salmon wrapped in spinach and fried in a crispy wonton, was pretty good. The sweet chile sauce that came with was a bit too saccharine for my blood, so I avoided it. Because it was an appetizer, I polished it off pretty quickly and spent the rest the time trying to put a dent in the humongous plate of fries that I received. The gf seemed happy with her meal. Of course the portion was huge, so she boxed up half to take home. The highlight of the meal would be put off for a few hours more. As always, I ordered a slice of strawberry cheesecake for the two of us to enjoy at home.  (I rarely dine at CF anymore, but I stop in at least once a month to grab a slice of cheesecake. Strawberry is my go-to, but their more exotic flavors are pretty good as well. Even now, I'm looking forward to pumpkin coming back in the fall. But I digress...) I ordinarily find CF to be a 3-star establishment, and this probably would have been a 3-star meal if not for our server (I wish I had remembered her name). She was sweet, professional, and seemed to always be around without hovering. My gf drinks water like a camel, and at many places, servers give up trying to keep her glass full. Not the case here, as her glass never went empty and all of our other needs were attended to as soon as they arrived. It's amazing how much the upgrade from adequate server to excellent server impacts the restaurant experience. Thanks mainly to the service, this experience exceeded expectations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-woodbridge-2?start=80,3.24,3.19,3.19,3.088,3.21

One point though, it is a popular restaurant and frequently they'll be on a wait despite having a lot of clean and open tables. I guess those times they didn't have enough waiters. On a week night we waited a good while and sat waiting with longing eyes at a lot of clean tables. We ended up being seated at a two person table immediately next to a large birthday group. The service was still good, food was still good, just a little hard to speak over the people enjoying their party. Maybe I'm just getting old though!

This location has an average of a 20 to 30 minute wait and I've never had any complaints regarding the food. A complaint I do have is the practice of bringing out plates that have been heated hot enough to melt your skin. I'm all for receiving my meal freshly cooked and hot, but to hand someone a dinner plate hot enough to keep your meal cooking as it's left the kitchen is ridiculous. During our recent visit the wait staff attempted to set down two of these plates in front of my two-year-old and three-year-old and looked annoyed when I sent the plates back asking for something safe.

We went in for just cake and beer so I thought there's no way that would go wrong.  Then the fat kid inside me said FEED ME!  So I ordered the Factory Nachos.  Huge mistake.  It was burned to oblivion and the cheese tasted like they couldn't ferment it properly so they just added actual mold they found on the floor.  Please don't order the Factory Nachos.  We were asked if we wanted a box since we only took a few bites I politely said no thank you.  The few bites also gave me wicked heartburn.  But that's not their fault.  The cheesecake, beer, and our bartender DeLante (sorry if I butchered the spelling) all get five stars!!! The Factory Nachos with poop get negative stars!

50,Gr8vette G.,"Lake Ridge, VA",2,242,1817.0,2.0,2016-03-05,"General Review: If there was one perfect word to describe this Cheesecake Factory location, it would be ""Average"" or ""Safe"". You have the average styling of every Cheesecake Factory out there. The people at the hostess station are not nice, but at least can get by with doing their job. The waiters are average and just passing the level of niceness where you may not be able to tell they are only here for the job and not enjoyment and to make acquaintances. The food tastes ok and is definitely cooked safe. In other words, there is noting elevated about it! The restaurant, in general, attracts a crowd, but that's because this is one of the only restaurants in Dale City to consistently cook their food correctly. If you avoid the weekends or have less than an hour wait, then you enjoyment here would be significantly better!  My Experience: I have been going to this Cheesecake Factory ever since its opening here. I have never had a above average meal. The last time I came here, I had a party of seven. They told me it would be an hour wait. No biggie. We ended up waiting almost an hour and a half. They were seating people who came in after us and we even saw a party that was with us leave. It was a bit frustrating how they were handling seating arrangements. The even more frustrating part was that they seated us at a six top booth with a chair at the end. It was frustrating because we went through the restaurant to try and figure out where they were seating us and those six top booths kept going empty and then being refilled by people who came in after us. We went on the assumption that they were going to join some tables together at the section with the booth and chairs. The waiter we had was fairly nice, but seemed to have a hard time understanding we had over a hour wait and were starving. We got our orders in fairly quickly, but even that had to have a long wait time attached to it. We waited about two hours for that meal to come out. We basically devoured that meal within 30 minutes and then we got our Cheesecake and ate that in a hour total. In total, we were at Cheesecake from around 12pm until 4:30pm. I almost had the chance to check into Cheesecake Factory again on Yelp! Would I ever bring back or recommend bringing a large party to Cheesecake Factory? Heck No! Unless this place was empty on the weekdays would I ever consider that choice again! I don't even think I would take a small party, let alone two people, on the weekend either.

We ordered a lot of dishes with chicken and 2 of them were raw and had to be sent back along with a burger that was way over done.We had to send so much food back that we asked them to just take some of it off the bill because a lot of us had finished eating (cheesecake included) with the rest of the reordered food not arriving. We tried to be understanding however part of the reason why it took so long for the food to come out was because we had to flag down waiters to get the bad dishes taken back. We lost all hope when we saw our waiter just texting away at the bar rather than seeing if we were happy with the food.

I would much rather have just gone somewhere else since there are plenty of restaurants to choose from at Potomac Mills. Pluses: - The restaurant is quite spacious with plenty of seating. It looks like literally every other cheesecake factor - The food was good. The salad is huge, so I'm not actually sure if its any healthier for you because you're eating so much of it - The pasta on the lunch special menu was also yummy Minuses: - Some of the bread they give you is hard. Beware. - Our waitress seemed to be annoyed that we were annoyed that we had waited 40 minutes for our food. Not the best customer service - Also I'm gonna go there and say it, but their food is so terrible for you. One slice of cheesecake has over 1,000 calories. It breaks my heart, but yeah, it wouldn't be wise to dine here regularly unless you have a Michael Phelps-type metabolism, or just give zero cares about your health",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-woodbridge-2?start=20,3.24,3.21,3.21,2.7,3.222

39,Amanda P.,"Wahiawā, HI",0,16,4.0,4.0,2016-08-26,"This was my first time at cheesecake factory so I can't compare it to any other locations but after all the hype I heard I was honestly disappointed. Regular menu items were okay at best. Menu is very long, lots to choose from but can be a hassle doing so. But definitely not worth the price being charged. I ordered the ribeye medium and it came to me over salted and well done. It was also very thin. The ribeye wasn't really tough but felt grainy when chewing. The meal came with mashed potatoes and fresh steamed green beans. Both were very good. My husband had the fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp and did not like the shrimp. Like the steak the shrimp was overcooked.  Our waitress wasn't too attentive, we waited too long for our drinks and the bread that comes before the meal(which was ok at best). The Arnold Palmer was delicious, too bad drinks were only refilled once  and only after it being requested. Which took a while since we had to be on the lookout for the waitress.  I maintained 4 stars because I did like their cheesecake. And would come here for their other dessert items but not for an actual meal. The cheesecake wasn't too heavy and the manager was very accommodating concerning my food. I think perhaps some revision on staff members being more prompt to customers and food being cooked as it was ordered it could be a good place to eat all around. But for now I'd only come for desserts (at least at this location)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-woodbridge-2?start=20,3.4,3.24,3.24,2.6719999999999997,3.3040000000000007

54,Sabrina P.,"Stafford, VA",7,28,,3.0,2016-09-18,"Came here tonight with my mom, my dad, my brother, my sister, her boyfriend & my girlfriend and I was extremely underwhelmed.  Firstly, I came late. So when we were greeted by our server- (who did not tell me her name and I had to find out by looking at the ticket) she didn't really welcome us or even say hi. She just said ""what can I get y'all to drink."" Ok something I can get over for sure and definitely not upset at this point. However, after that there were many rude gestures and things she did throughout my experience there. Firstly, when she was taking our orders, she made absolutely no eye contact with us except looking at each one of us one time to ""signal"" that it was our turn to order. I ordered a salad and when I told her I wanted ranch instead of the balsamic vin- she did NOTHING to acknowledge that she heard me. She just kept writing then looked away to my mom signaling it was her turn. My mom said, excuse me I just wanted to make sure that you heard she wanted ranch? She looked at my mom and said ""yeah"" and that was it.  My brother and girlfriend both ordered a beer. His beer came out but she forgot my girlfriends so she did receive it a while later. When we were done ordering, she pretty much disappeared until our food came out. Once our food came out, my sister needed silverware so she gave it to her, asked if we needed anything, then essentially darted away. I asked for no tomatoes on my salad and I got tomatoes AND I HATE TOMATOES. I didn't have the chance to ask her to fix it because she never came back. Didn't see her again until the end when we needed boxes BUT she did box our food for us, so I will give her that.  When she asked if we wanted a dessert menu and we said yes, she went to grab one. When she dropped it off to us, she didn't say one thing. She literally dropped it off and walked away. She didn't even have the decency to say, ""here's the dessert menu"" I mean really? Are you serious? We ordered our desserts, ate them, boxed them up on our own and asked for the check. She slid the card, came back and gave a lousy ""thank you guys"" and walked away.   Thankfully I checked to see her name at the end (if I'm remembering correctly) which I don't want to put her on blast on Yelp- but just so I know to never ask for her when I go back. The sad things are 1) I'm a server myself so I know EXACTLY how service should be especially from an establishment like Cheesecake-AND I can tell the difference between a rough night, (which i always take into account before tipping/yelping) and just being straight up rude to someone who is PAYING YOU. 2) My mom knows to tip 20% (mostly from me being a server) so she still tipped between 19-20% because she felt bad not doing so. And 3) if she was having a bad night, or whatever- we would have understood but we ALL saw her laughing, smiling and being cheerful with other tables. Unacceptable and flat out rude. It makes me sad that my parents wanted to take us out to dinner and spend time with us and we were treated like we were a pain.  And honestly, I always always always give the benefit of the doubt to servers whenever I'm yelping, doing any kinds of surveys, or talking to management because at times I know how it is. But this was absolutely ridiculous. The food was excellent, and I WOULD go back because I know how cheesecake is supposed to be. But who knows..

At the end our meal, the check came and showed that there was two charges for fries. We informed the waiter who said sending unedible fries back and getting new fries will incur a second charge.

Huevos rancheros was warm  (could have been hotter) and eggs over easy (the way they're supposed to be).  Crab hash was as cold as the freshly sliced tomatoes on the side.

General manager came to our table and we explained that the crab hash came out cold and the Huevos rancheros was now cold while waiting for the hot sauce.  Sent both plates back to be completely redone. Waited over 30 minutes for the new entrées to arrive (our order had obviously gone to the back of the line). The crab hash was now barely warm and the eggs were hard-boiled. The huevos rancheros was now cool and the eggs were over done to boot. Too hungry to send back the crab hash, so I ate it. The huevos rancheros were too cold and overdone to eat and sent that back.  Bottom line, after sitting in the restaurant for over an hour and a half we had one edible meal.

Last night, I used the gift card to make one final attempt at getting a grilled cheddar sandwich. Ordered sandwich over phone and when I asked if I could receive cheddar cheese instead of American, the woman taking my ordered exclaimed, ""Of course!""   Brought home my sandwich and yet again, it had American cheese instead.  At this point I was completely fed up, but a family member was livid and decided to call the restaurant and drive back there in order to pick up a correctly-made sandwich (I did not recommend doing this, as I had done it before, and only ended up with two incorrect sandwiches). The manager on duty even brought my family member to the back and showed off the cheeses they use, demonstrating the separation between cheese types.  I guess by having a manager come physically show a customer the ingredients, the kitchen staff finally understood, and for the first time since I can even remember, they made me a grilled cheddar sandwich. My family member was given a $15 gift card for having to go back to the store.   I am sorry, but this is beyond insanity. The fact that I have gone through so many different negative experiences with this restaurant, and have tried SO. MANY. TIMES. to get a GRILLED. CHEESE. SANDWICH. made with a different kind of cheese, makes ME seem crazy at this point, and I don't think that's right, at all.  I do not want your gift cards. I do not want free cheesecake. I do not want apologies. All I ever wanted was good service and the food that I ordered and you promised. It is beyond clear that, that is too much to ask.

Joked with wife that at the speed (or lack of) our server, we'd be better off ordering breakfast so we could eat the right food for the right time of day.  What made things even more aggravating is that our server took the drink order from the table next to ours, and brought them their drinks, but failed to check on us.  Its like we didn't matter to her. First time to this location and undecided if I will try this one again.  Previous experiences were in Indiana and that was very enjoyable.

They hit a new low this time.  I ordered the Shepard's Pie and told the waiter that I did NOT want my Shepard's Pie with clumpy beef.  It is supposed to be ground beef, not big clumps of beef.  After over a 30 minute wait the Shepard's Pie appeared with the clumpy beef.  I sent it back and asked for the menu.  The manager appeared at this point to see what the problem was.  He went off to check and returned and said that on this day they could not make the Shepard's Pie without the clumpy beef.  So I ordered a filet Mignon cooked medium rare.  The manager said it would be complimentary.  After another long wait the filet showed up cooked medium.  I had already given up and tried to leave but the manager got the filet and almost twisted my are to eat it, again telling me it was complimentary.  He asked me how it tasted and I told him it would have been better had it been cooked properly but I ate it since he said it was free.  The mashed potatoes that accompanied the filet were so filled with potato skin that I literally couldn't eat them.  For some reason the filet came in two pieces.  Only at the Cheesecake Factory do you get a filet in two pieces.  And when I finally asked for the check to pay and leave not only was my wife's fish and chips on the bill but also the filet.  At that point I just paid and left.  Had the manager told me I was paying for the filet I would have sent it back for the fact it was in two pieces and it was over cooked.  You wonder why it is taking them so long to cook your steak and it is because they are overcooking it.  That was one of the WORST experiences I have ever had in any restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-woodbridge-2,2.84,3.02,3.02,,2.9480000000000004

But I honestly can't shake this burning desire to right a review myself about the experience I had late last night at this location. Last night I decided to stop into cheesecake factory  after deciding not to go to bar louie nearby (BAD IDEA) my boyfriend and I saw online that you all were open til 12:30 so we decided that popping in around 9:50 was feasible. We opted for the bar area for the simple fact that it was late enough already. I sat at the table and was greeted by our server (William) who instantly seemed annoyed that he had to deal with another table. Maybe he was about to be cut and my party was another hinderance to his friday night plans? Not sure. Either way, I started with two waters and waited on my boyfriend to get back to the table so we could decide on a more exciting beverage. 10 minutes later waters and bread arrived. No bread plates we on the table so 5 minutes later he comes back and we ask for bread plates and he looked at us and said ""yeah i'm not used to being on the bar area so i'm not used to having to bring plates."" ok... so he brings plates and and at that point we're ready to order apps and drinks. William asked and we put in an order for two pineapple moscow mules and before we could even tell him the apps we decided on he rushed off and put our drinks in. It to have been another 10 minutes until those arrived which I get it specialty cocktails take time to make but it wasn't because the bar was busy I saw them sitting at the service well for quite some time....william no where to be found. He then comes over to tell us drinks were on the way...and we go ahead and put our apps and entrees in because at this point I figured we might be there until close because of how delayed the service was becoming. Drinks and apps finally arrived (both delicious btw the only reason this review got one star, that and the fact that none was an option.) We finish up with our drinks and were ready for another and when I tell you we didn't see William for another 15 minutes I wish I was lying. We finally decided that we should get up and order drinks from the bar and when he noticed THEN he decided to ask if we needed another drink. Annoyed and quite frankly ready to leave, we got our drinks and settled up with the bar. The most annoying part of the experience was that we had an amazing server that had both tables next to us which only made me yearn that we were seated in his section. Food arrived and I just asked for the check and boxes because I wasn't trying to have to hunt down William to check out come the end of the meal. The check came and ran a mere $90 and this was the first time in my life where I didn't want to leave 20% where as i'd usually tip more than that. It took everything in me to leave the $18 that he clearly didn't work for. I don't know if this was an off day for him or if this is just the Cheesecake Factory standard but it was by far the absolute worst service i've ever had. I will not be returning.

5,Jasmine A.,"Dale City, VA",0,2,,1.0,2018-01-07,The WORST experience I have ever had. Was told by the host that it would be an hour to hour and a half wait. After waiting more than a 1hour and a half i went up to the hoat stamd and asked how much longer. Was told they were cleaning the tables. Waited another 15 minutes and noticed they were seating others who came in an hour after i had checked in. I had said something to the host about this and he tried to argue with me and then the manager asked to talk to me off to the side and told me not to yell/argue with his employees. The manager tried to argue with me thatour table was ready but a party fecided to stay. How the hell does someone decide to stay after the table was cleaned. Instead of trying to argue own up to your mistake of having seated another party at the table.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-woodbridge-2,2.96,3.0,3.0,,2.9840000000000004
3,Carolina L.,"West Springfield, VA",350,18,3.0,1.0,2018-01-09,"My friend and I are sitting at the bar right now because service here lacks. We came in asking for a table for two and got seated at a table facing the bar. We waited for almost 15 minutes and no server showed up to even say hello to us or even acknowledged us. Hungry and annoyed, I got up and ask the hostess to move us to a booth. We sat at the booth and again the server doesn't acknowledge us for about 10 minutes then after that time she says, ""I'll be with you in a couple minutes""...... REALLY?! At this point we've spent 25 minutes at this restaurant and have yet to order, unbelievable. Mind you the restaurant isn't even that busy! We thought about leaving and going to Bahama Breeze at that point, but instead decide to move ourselves to the bar. So now times wasted and we are siting at the handicap section of the bar. Thankfully the bartender Michael was on his game. He was speedy and attentive! Do better Cheesecake Factory, be like Michael.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-woodbridge-2,2.84,2.98,2.98,,2.924
