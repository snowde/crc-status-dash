Jou M.,"Albuquerque, NM",1,12,,3.0,9/9/2017,"The food was good, everything came out fresh even though we are there late, after 11pm. Our server was nice and courteous, he did a great job. Unfortunately there was a drunk who approached our 9 year old son and his friend several times. He was inappropriate, rude, slurring, and stumbling all over our son and his friend when they tried to go to the bathroom. We encountered the drunk as we were going into the restaurant, he was on the patio with several other drunks and started yelling at our 9 year old son and his friend because of the football jersey he wore. I didn't think much of it and was thankful they were outside.  But he came inside stumbling and harassing my son and his friend in the restaurant and then again outside as we left. I'm not sure what a restaurants policy is regarding drunks but I'm pretty sure they should draw the line when an drunk adult is harassing children yelling at them from across the restaurant, engaging them as they try to go to the restroom.  My husband had to jump up out of his seat to get the man to back off. And he still kept harassing the kids. This was not appropriate behavior and the manager should have done something, intervened immediately.  The manager didn't say a thing to this man.  The worst experience I've ever had in a restaurant with my son. Something should have been done to protect our kids from this type of harassment in a restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-albuquerque-28
Lisa B.,"Spokane, WA",69,61,22,1.0,10/30/2017,Don't come here if you want good service. Yikes. Sat at a table in the bar area. Took the waitress 10 minutes to visit our table on a Monday afternoon. And she didn't even apologize. I had to remind her of a drink special too.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-albuquerque-28
Isaiah J.,"Rio Rancho, NM",0,6,,3.0,12/1/2017,"My experience at Applebee's was ok....first I ordered water with lemon and the water tasted like toilet water, and the salad I ordered, I had asked for ranch dressing in the salad and they put some other dressing, and then I asked for more lemon for my water, and the lemons looked like they took them out of the trash and chewed (bad lemons).....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-albuquerque-28
Miguel L.,"Albuquerque, NM",1,5,2,4.0,8/9/2017,"Some goodish service in my opinion. Some waiters are helpful and joyish whereas others are plain boring and unfriendly. Our main waiter is helpful and kind. The other waiter, the female, is non friendly. She doesn't ask how we're doing nor does she serve us with a smile as expected. And as a bonus she doesn't care about our order missing something. Our main waiter is much better. Thus getting the rating of 4 of 5.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-albuquerque-28
Natalie H.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",0,2,,1.0,5/21/2016,"DONT GO HERE!!!  The service is awful and the night manager, Charisa, does not take responsibility for her servers mistakes she will just come yell at u for saying the food u ordered is incorrect. Instead she makes racial slurs by saying that we are poor Niggers trying to get free food when we complain our food is incorrect and threatens to call the cops because we ask for some of our money back for the poor service. I mean they utterly didn't even bring a meal out for a guest who was ordered for twice. No one who makes racial mark should be in charge.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-albuquerque-28
Jordan R.,"Magnolia, TX",0,18,11,4.0,4/24/2016,"We were hesitant to eat here after reading the bad reviews, but maybe the location has made some changes.  The service was fast and friendly, no complaints.  The food was very good, especially for Applebees.  We got the cheeseburger eggrolls for an appetizer, and the brisket tacos and bourbon chicken as entrées.  I also got ""the perfect margarita"" which was literally perfect.  I'm a huge margarita fan and order one at every opportunity, this one was absolutely delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-albuquerque-28
Chelsea W.,"Albuquerque, NM",91,147,191,3.0,9/21/2013,"The verdict: my chicken tortilla soup and chicken oriental salad good, husband did not like his sirloin dinner but liked his wedge salad  Not out if this world but not what they are here for either It was adequate but nothing to rave about",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-albuquerque-28
Lorraine K.,"Albuquerque, NM",5,27,7,1.0,2/16/2016,"This place has really gone down hill. Had fairly good experiences till now. Went on a Tuesday night and not many in restaurant.  Our server was dull, inattentive and didn't seem to like her job. The food was served slightly warm and took awhile to come out. Husband asked for a side of mayo when order came (he never got it). No more Applebee's for this family.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-albuquerque-28
Kelly H.,"Palm Desert, CA",11,15,26,1.0,7/13/2014,"We will never go back to any Applebee's ever. 40 minutes to take our order and another hour to get our food. Very little Gluten Free choices.. My napkin was wet and dirty with food wrapped around the utensils. Soup tasted like Campbell's canned soup. Air conditioning was so cold we were freezing. Numerous things on the menu recalled. Not a good sign. Nothing on menu low calorie, fresh or without sauce covering it. Yuck!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-albuquerque-28
James T.,"Rio Rancho, NM",244,1,,1.0,2/27/2016,Waited forty five minutes for our food plus.

Selina G.,"Whittier, CA",69,58,5,1.0,2/12/2013,"Got a steak and shrimp plate. Asked for it medium well and it was way overcooked. Tasted like rubber. Shrimp was overcooked, like, crunchy-hard disgustingness.  Vegetables tasted gross and so did my red potatoes. I mean, it was just a mess thrown together. Not happy at all.  Did complain, got a free meal on my next visit, but almost too disgusted to try something else.  Service was fantastic. hah!  Maybe they can give me credit I can use at the bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-albuquerque-28
April J.,"Lorton, VA",0,107,,4.0,10/7/2014,"late night dinner after walking out of another restaurant (see review for IHOP). not many places in area open after 10pm. glad we went there. Mac, our waiter is excellent. food was great too. fries were hot and did not have to ask for extra crispy just to get hot fries. will go back again. I am sure Mac hopes we do because I did leave a nice tip which he deserved.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-albuquerque-28
Paigr Z.,"Westside, Albuquerque, NM",1,2,,1.0,12/1/2014,"Poor food and manager was letting his clearly underage friends drink alcohol and they were very loud, drunk, and obnoxious. Then they drove! The food that night was about the same quality. Been here many times and the food is usually mediocre but the price isn't bad so of you're looking for cheap and crappy this is your place. Unprofessional.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-albuquerque-28
Stephanie C.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,4,,1.0,12/22/2013,"Staff was friendly, but not efficient.  Food was under cooked and soup tasted like it came out of a can... not fresh and very processed.

John M.,"Albuquerque, NM",3,26,25,3.0,9/29/2014,"I have had no complaints pertaining to the food or service in my prior visits. Well, Yippee... That has now changed. Like I stated before, my food and service has always been pretty good until now. I went with my girlfriend and her son, ordered off the 2 for $20 menu, cheese sticks for an appetizer, I ordered the quesadilla burger and my girlfriend ordered the oriental salad while the little guy ordered a corn dog. The cheese sticks were decent but the marinara sauce was absolutely disgusting! It tasted like a concentrated tomato paste from a can without adding water. And a really bad tasting one! My burger was Ok, flavor was fine but it was served on some super thin cracker like tortilla with barely any cheese. My girlfriends salad was good despite the fact that all the dressing was placed somewhere hidden underneath everything which she didn't find til she packed it in her to go box. As for the service, our waiter was very attentive and worked quickly and efficiently. No complaints. Restaurant was clean. Overall, not to thrilled. They do have a decent happy hour and specials on apps. So, a decent neighborhood bar, not so decent neighborhood restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-albuquerque-28
Chase D.,"Albuquerque, NM",30,90,,2.0,11/8/2011,"Food is fine, but the service is pretty lack luster.  Been there three or four times, and half the time they comp items on our check due to bad service.  We aren't fond of raising a big stink and try to remain understanding.  Especially if it's busy.  But the offenses comped here have been pretty blatant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-albuquerque-28
Alex B.,"Mesa, AZ",9,9,1,1.0,3/9/2014,Worse! Family before us got served and they just seated us and forgot us. 10 minutes in and still no server for drinks we walked out. DONT GO HERE never coming back,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-albuquerque-28
