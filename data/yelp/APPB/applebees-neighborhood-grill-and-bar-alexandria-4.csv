Jazmin K.,"Alexandria, VA",6,37,1,5.0,10/26/2017,"I met up with a group of friends last week for the $1 Margaritas and had such a great time! I haven't been to Applebee's in probably 20 years and the girls there definitely gave my friends and I a good experience.  I wanted to take the time to recognize our server Britt who was quite busy with a few tables but did her best to accommodate all of her tables.  Though she took longer than I'm used to, to check on our table, what's most important is for all servers to understand that every night won't be easy, sometimes it will be a busy night, it isn't realistic to think that a server will get to you very quickly every night. Britt is only 1 person and for being as busy as she appeared she handled her load well and stayed very pleasant with not just our table but all of the tables she was helping. I also want to acknowledge Hazel and Tiara who were working behind the bar and all 3 of the ladies seem to work as a great team and have positive attitudes, definitely a relaxing environment. Thank you ladies !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-alexandria-4
Stephanie B.,"Bonaire, GA",71,32,25,1.0,10/3/2017,If your looking for good food and good service don't look here.  We waited 20 minutes to be sat as the host conversed with other employees.  After we were sat we waited 30 minutes and didn't get greeted or asked if we wanted something.  40 minutes later we finally found a server and he took our order.  Let's see how much time we can waste on this disaster of a location.  #wewillnevercomeback #waitingfordays #applebeesfailure,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-alexandria-4
Andrew C.,"Springfield, VA",30,28,6,1.0,1/7/2018,"We went tonight because we saw a commercial for the all you can eat ribs.  I haven't been to this location in a few years and was hopeful.  When we arrived we ordered our drinks and were off to a good start.  The food came out in a reasonable time and was all correct.  My wife asked for some dipping sauce for her chicken tenders and the waiter forgot to bring it to her.  We then started to eat and all of us were out of water.  It took about 10 minutes for the waiter to check on us and then he remembered the dipping sauce.  We asked for more water and some more ribs.  He then came back with one water.  We never got the second order of ""all you can eat"" ribs, it took over 25 minutes and we just gave up waiting for the food.  Now I remember why I had not gone to this place in several years....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-alexandria-4
Gail B.,"Washington, DC",381,1223,1839,1.0,10/26/2017,"We stopped in with friends from out of town. There wasn't anyone waiting in the lobby and we could see empty tabletops at the bar and empty booths. The greeters said that there was a 20 minute wait. That didn't make any sense, unless they were short staffed. They weren't clear on why we had to wait, which would have helped us understand. I asked if we could wait at a booth, even if it took longer to place orders. The staff seemed reluctant to seat us ""early"" and even more reluctant to allow me to ask a manager if we could sit comfortably at a booth while waiting.

We waited for our food for at least an hour. The food was ok however it gave me food poisoning. I don't know if they were understaffed or what but that resteraunt is the worse.

Server never offered us refills or eating utensils (no forks, knives or napkins). After asking twice I gave up told him to put my food in a to go box and got out of there.

We asked for a table for 4, the hostess did not acknowledge us and disappeared for 5 minutes, came back and told us it would be a 45 minute wait. Now understand, we arrived at midnight, the place said it closed at 1 am.... there were also only 7 tables sat in the whole place. I am a server myself and know that you wouldn't be placed on this kind of wait, we asked the hostess if she was joking and yet again we were ignored. We then inquire if we can sit at the bar, yet again we are ignored. We ask two more times and nothing! So we walk to the bar ourselves. We wait at the bar for 10 minutes and no bartender in sight! At that point we gave up and left, but noticed on our way out that two servers were sitting at the host stand conversing with the hostess... funny how they have time to talk but don't have time to take care of a four top... definitely put a sour taste in mouth for the applebees brand.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-alexandria-4

Our food came out hot and delicious. (I had the full rack baby back with 4 cheese mac and french fries).

We got back in the car and decided to give it another 10 minutes before going back in. Of course, time passed and our food was waiting. They were suppose to bring it to the car, but it wasn't a huge deal. The guy didn't seem too busy and could have easily brought it out since it was all paid for.

Penny W.,"Alexandria, VA",1,33,22,1.0,4/2/2017,"Ugh. I can't believe I did this to my own mother. She stayed over on 3/30, we were famished and It was too late to pick up from Outback. I decided to try the Applebees I've driven past for years. It was inedible and I regularly exist on food that I can microwave. We ordered the Bourbon Street Steak with Crispy Red Potatoes and a Triple Chocolate Meltdown to share. The steak looked like roadkill that had baked in the sun for months; it was placed on a bed of slimy, onions and mushrooms floating in a puddle of grease. I had to inspect the mound of filaments to distinguish the mushrooms from the onions. The red potatoes were dry and shriveled.The chocolate dessert was stale and would be a distant second to a hostess cupcake on its best day. The vanilla ice cream we did eat but didn't enjoy...I can only describe it as cheap tasting. I picked up this order yet still experienced crappy service. I waited at the hostess stand for a few minutes but was not acknowledged. I then asked a server where to pick up food and was told to ask the bartender. I then waited at the vacant bar for a few minutes and stared at a group of employees chatting while the packaged food was on the bar aging further.

Marianne L.,"Alexandria, VA",225,620,330,2.0,11/30/2013,"We had a good meal here and will probably be back as Mom likes them and there are none where she lives (plenty of tv ads though). But a somewhat shady experience when the bill came is costing a 3rd star, and likely will for continued visits. Bottom line - add up your bill. Make sure the total at the far away bottom is actually what it should be - and watch out for hinky explanations from the management. After catching an afternoon flick, Mom wanted to come here for dinner. I did give the menu an advance scouting to make sure I could fine something that would fit in with my healthier eating habits (hey, at least I try) but it's Mom so of course we're going to go here if she wants to. We greeted upon entering and the hostess kindly took notice of our request to be seated away from the arctic tundra that was the entry way to a nice booth on the non-bar side of the restaurant, where we might actually be able to see what we were eating. Our friendly waiter joined us to take our drink order a few minutes later and to see if we were ready to order or had questions. Mom opted for the 4-cheese Mac & Cheese with Honey Pepper Chicken Tenders. Sometimes you just got to love your Mom who chooses the one thing on the menu you're dying to have - but won't because you simply know what a nutritional catastrophe its bound to be. So she ordered it and I got to try it :-)  Works for me. I ordered the garlic sirlion (rare - expecting at best to receive med-rare).  We also  indulged in some Green Bean Crispers, one of my favorite apps - if not the healthiest of selections :-) Our entrees came and sadly my steak was very well done, couldn't have gotten a drop of juice out of it if I tried. I flagged the waiter down and let him know. Every business handles this situation a bit different - and I could see the waiter struggling for a moment not wanting to leave one patron with nothing to eat while the other dined or their meal got cold. I was always taught the proper thing was to replace the entire dish - since the sides are meant to be eaten with the main. But the waiter took away my steak only, leaving the mushroom and and roasted red potatoes. In short order, a nice rare sirloin arrived back at the table. Everything was fine until the check arrived. Mind you, I'd never once asked that my meal be comped so I was quite surprised to see that directly below the line for my steak dinner, the value had been deducted. Problem was - after I scanned down through 5+ inches of nonsense about gift cards, diner survey numbers, and whatnot - there to my surprise at the bottom of the slip was the total not up at the top under the itemized order.  This is a bit weird. I'm not an infrequent dinner and am used to inches of nonsense that I immediately ignore but that all usually comes AFTER the part that belongs on the check in the first place. I'm glad I'm good at doing math in my head as the total was far too high for 1 entree, 1 app and 2 drinks. The 2nd entree that had been deducted at the top was mysteriously added back in at the bottom.  The waiter was perplexed, understanding immediately that the bill clearly wasn't right. So he brought the manager over and quickly explained the problem. The manager gave some song and dance about it wasn't a comp that is how the corrected order had to be put into the kitchen. I call BS, though I clearly don't know how Applebee's POS system works. But if the order had to be put in again and then backed out so the kitchen would know to refire 1. why did the plate not come out complete (OK the waiter may have stuck his head in and said meat only), but of more concern 2. why weren't there 2 orders for my entree on the bill and one backed out. Frankly I think they tried to make it look like they'd comped it hoping I wouldn't notice that it was sneakily stuck back in way at the bottom.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-alexandria-4?start=20

I feel that I am treated like family every time I walk into the restaurant. I try to go to this place as much as I can. We go so much that we have a favorite waiter named Donna. We decided to adopt her into our little family. My mom calls her niece. We don't get her all the time, and we used to be sad when we couldn't get her. It's hard to make that kind of relationship with a waiter.  The first thing I found out was that even when we do not have her, we are still having a great time. The food comes out great, and my drink never empties. The manager Ray has been there for as long as I can remember. If your having a concern, speak with him and he will see that everything turns out ok. We have gone so many times that we must have used at least all of the waiters by now. I just can't wait to go back next time, and get wonderful service and food ((Recommend the Mozzarella Stick, the sauce is not the nasty chunk kind.

Bring your SCUBA gear, this one's smokey smokey.  I got the nachos, which I usually like from Applebee's because they have cheese sauce, not real cheese, which dries up and sticks all of the chips together. But once again, I was either overchipped or undergoodied.  Because less than halfway through, I was checking underneath dry chips to see if there were any non-dry chips left.  Nope, just more dry ones. My wife got this thing from the weight watchers menu, which she says was 'not as good as steak night' at the officers' club, but not bad.  It looked okay, but I suspect that the sauce on the steak was mass produced by children at the Applebee's factory.  The vegetables were probably frozen. Just overall uninspiring.  Not sure why I'm bothering to write what everybody already knows.  Applebee's is a decent place to get food when you don't feel like cooking it yourself.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-alexandria-4?start=100

Michael C.,"Alexandria, VA",2,88,62,2.0,4/20/2013,"This is the most accurate, precise, and unbiased review for Applebee's at the 6310 Richmond Highway location.  First of all, I am not new to Applebee's.  I have been to several across the United States and even one outside the United States.  For the most part I have had great experiences.  Their Bourbon Street Steak is one of the greatest entree's in this restaurant category - when prepared correctly of course.  But this isn't about the past.  This is about today. I ordered my food for Curbside To Go today and one of the entrees was the 9 oz House Sirloin with mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables.  During the call my order was taken and was even recommended to get the 2 for $20 deal since I put in orders for 2 separate meals.  The other was Chicken Penne.  Anyways, I was told 15 minutes and I got there in 18 minutes.  I noticed that unlike every other Applebee's, they don't ask you for the color or make of your car.  You see, in most Applebee's, they actually come out to your car.  That is the entire point of Curbside To Go.   Well, I didn't sit out in my car waiting like a doofus.  It was obvious that I had to walk in myself.  I noticed the place was about half full but had a musty smell.  Looked very old and dim.  Keep in mind this was at 2:40pm on a Saturday where it is super sunny outside.  The bartender got my order and I checked out.  All is good right?  WRONG! Before I say what's wrong, let me tell you that I'm cutting for the summer so I obviously have the worst nightmare to all restaurant chains that give meal sizes in terms of weight - a digital scale!  As I look at my supposedly ""9 oz"" steak, it looks really small.  It must be the most dense steak in the history of cows or I just got hosed.  I take the steak and place it on my scale (that is tared already) and what does it read?  5.35 oz!!!  I kid you not.  So I'm thinking maybe they charged me for a 7 oz steak and the cook got a really fatty piece and maybe he cut it a little short.  WRONG!  I was charged for a 9 oz.  It makes me wonder what a 7 oz would look like?  A chicken nugget?   I just ate everything and so far so good.  Who knows what will happen later.  All I know is that I was expecting 9 oz.  Now I'm going to have to fix a protein shake to make up for the loss!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-alexandria-4?start=60

Tyler R.,"Philadelphia, PA",94,222,58,1.0,4/23/2012,"What a surprise- I found myself at an applebees on a Friday night in Alexandria, VA. This was not your typical Applebee's, or maybe it is. We entered looking for a seat at the bar. Seeing that it was full, we took seats at a table adjacent. The server was polite and took our drink orders quickly.  That's when the excitement happened. First, a large group entered and was seated around us (four to one side and one person to the other). This influx of people must have attracted much attention. A man peddling balloon animals approached their table as a Kevin Costner movie (during a soft core scene) played in the background. He made two large heart-shaped flowers for the women at the nearby table. This happened while I waited for my salad and beer.  Unfortunately, the woman seated at our left had an undercooked burger, and she made it well known. The manager came over, and it just so happened to be the balloon animal artist! His presence drew my attention to the bar where he was stationed. There sat a man worth a glorious mullet flirting with a waitress. Clearly this place had everything. The salad I had was fine, though over dressed (they did use sesame oil or sesame flavor in the dressing) and over priced ($11) for a lot of lettuce and sliced almonds with crispy chicken bits sprinkled about.  I was left underwhelmed, so I took advantage of their half price appetizers and ordered onion rings.  They came, but were first served to the table next to us by a waitress who had her purse and was leaving for the night. When they got to the right place, it turned out there were a few shrimp mixed in. The onion rings themselves were pretty bad- all deep fried breading and no onion. The BBQ sauce served with it was sugary and awful. Thankfully, there was Heinz ketchup on the table.   As I finished the onion rings, I requested the check. The woman to our left received her re-cooked burger as I signed. She proclaimed it was still raw, and my friend and I decided it was prime time to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-alexandria-4?start=60

Carl W.,"Arlington, VA",109,56,,2.0,2/26/2014,"I do not care for Applebee's in general but I somehow ended up with a $15 gift card and an empty stomach so I went. It was Applebee's and I did not have high expectations and those low expectations were met. Nothing was outright bad - neither the food nor the service - but nothing was very good either. I had a Reuben sandwich and a salad. They were fine. It is hard to screw up a Reuben but it is easy to not add any character to it. It was not what you would call good, but also not bad. It filled my belly. That is about all I can say for it. The service was slow, considering it was past the lunch rush and I was one of perhaps ten customers. I won't be back unless I end up with another gift card on a day I forgot to bring lunch to work. Funny - I once dated a woman who LOVED Applebee's and thought it was a great place. It was a short-lived relationship. It is like saying you love mediocrity, laugh tracks and blandness. I guess someone has to love that sort of thing.

When we were eating we decided to order a sangria and wings and the wings didn't come out it was already 15 minutes  if I didn't get up I'm sure it would if been more the restaurant was super slow, so there no excuse!!!! The sangria was sitting at the bar and no one decided to get it even the manager walked by it like four times and sits down the table next to us, it was just very rude and didn't even Care the sangria was there siting down, I went to the bartender to get it. I should of made him make me a new one but I didn't, and the wings I had to go to the bartender to get it as well, I didn't even want the wings anymore the bartender was nice and took them off and manager didn't even care at all!!!!

Mike D.,"Vienna, VA",28,15,,4.0,8/11/2012,"When you have kids, especially two small ones, it seems that this restaurant does a pretty good job of taking care of their Customers. We were seated quickly, even though there were 5 others ahead of us, and were promptly met by our Server within just a few minutes. Service was really above average, and the food came fast hot and delicious. The kids were having a ball, and Mom and Dad got to eat a meal that wasn't Hamburger Helper or grilled cheese sandwiches. I have to say that I'm a big fan of the regular and boneless hot wings with the spicey sauce. But I have to admit that they also do a pretty good job with the Buffalo Wing sauce as well.

""Table for two."" ""Well, let me go see if I can find a table."" I laughed out loud. I seriously thought he was joking. WE WERE THE ONLY CUSTOMERS IN THE RESTAURANT. EVERY TABLE WAS EMPTY. ""NO,"" he snapped. ""See all these tables? We don't have a waitress for every table! Stay here."" He slowly--very slowly--shuffled to the very back corner of the restaurant, and stared at a booth for a few seconds. Then he slowly--very slowly--shuffled back. Without saying a word, he grabbed two menus and walked again (slowly) to the table. We followed him and sat down. As it turns out, I was right. He wasn't the host. He was the manager. Wow. That encounter pretty much sums up our experience here. Though we were the only ones here (at 8:00 on a Monday night) it took 40 minutes to get our food.

The wait staff was very nice to us, however. The Triple Chocolate Meltdown was fantastic! I'd have given 5 stars, but we had to wait about 20 minutes before we were sat down, despite a number of empty tables and booths aside from the bar seating AND the hostess just standing around and not getting the names of patrons who were waiting for a table (until a gentleman behind us asked if they were taking names).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-alexandria-4?start=80

We were seated right away which is usually rare on a Saturday night at any chain restaurant. From the time we were seated however, it took about 10 minutes for our waitress to come introduce herself and take our orders for drinks, we even ordered our entrees right away because we obviously had enough time to decide. Our food came out in a timely fashion. She came to check on us when it looked like we were done and we asked for the check. It then took her 10 minutes to bring the check, then we had to wait about 10 minutes for her to come get our debit card, then about another 10 minutes again for her to come back with it. The table next to us that she was serving seemed unhappy with her service as well.

Amy G.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,38,4,2.0,6/28/2011,"I must concur with the other reviewers who said this is the worst Applebees they've been to. Unfortunately for me, it was on my birthday. Went with hubby, kids & in-laws for my b-day celebration. Usually go in Woodbridge & have outstanding service. Went to this one as it was closer to in-laws house. The food was pretty good but the service was horrible. The waitress (Sharday, I think) was rude & argued with me. I ALWAYS order the buffalo tenders for appetizer. I have never had a problem. I said boneless buffalo tenders, my kids both got tenders & fries. She asked what flavor sauce for the kids & then listed a bunch of flavors. We chose barbeque & honey mustard. We got BBQ tenders instead of buffalo ones. I went to find her & told her I said buffalo. She said ""no you didn't. I asked you what sauce & you said BBQ."" I explained to her that I thought she was asking what dipping sauce for the tenders & she said ""Well, I asked you that then I asked you about the boness tenders & you said BBQ."" I was real annoyed at this point & said ""it's my bday & that is the one thing I really wanted. I always get the buffalo tenders & I said buffalo tenders."" She continued to argue with me. I walked off & she followed me to the table where she argued with me & my husband for a few more min. then finally said ""what did you want, I can get you what you want."" Uh duh!!! Why she couldn't have just got me what I wanted to begin with is beyond me. I have been a waitress. FIRST RULE ""Don't argue with your customer!! Even if they're wrong."" So, of course we got our main course before the app. I told her to just to box it. I actually was pretty polite as I didn't want to get all stressed on my bday. I normally would have pushed it & spoken to a mngr. as she was very rude. She was ok after that but did not ask if we wanted more drinks. (We all would have ordered more bahama mamas & long island Ice teas) My in-laws paid sep. & were done about 15 min. before us. Paid cash.  She had them sing the bday song & brought me cake/ice cream. Very nice. Ok, maybe she's redeemed herself. I'll cut her some slack & still leave a decent tip. Then we wait like 20 min. after that for her to take the check up. Finally had to go find another server to go get her so we could pay. She brings back CC & we are charged for BOTH checks.  After hunting her down again & waiting for her to figure out her ""mistake"", she says ""Oh, my mngr said I had to combine the checks in order to comp the dessert. I forgot & hadn't cashed out the other check yet."" WTF?! So she's telling us she forgot she already was paid for the other check & accidentally added it to ours? Makes sense. She said ""the extra charge will come off your card tomorrow."" Today is Tues. 3 days later & it's not off yet. It's pending, so we'll see. Needless to say we did not leave a tip & will NEVER go back. I'll stay in Woodbridge, thank you. I have never had a bad experience at an Applebees before this. Stay away from this one!! Should have heeded the warnings of others. I can't help but wonder if she was trying to pocket the cash. Strange explanation. BTW, in the 12 yrs. my husband & I have been together this is the 1st time we have not left a tip. I felt a little bad about it after leaving until my hubby mentioned we have to worry & wonder if that charge is going to come off our card, on top of her rudeness. Good point!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-alexandria-4?start=80
