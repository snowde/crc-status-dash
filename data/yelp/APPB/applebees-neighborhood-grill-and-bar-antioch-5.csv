Gabby S.,"Concord, CA",63,5,2,2.0,12/27/2017,"You know the service is bad when the bartender working the bar has to serve your table!! Thank god for Lacey, she's an absolute delight. I made sure to tell her the money left on the table is for her only. It amazed me that we sat for 15 minutes and no drink order was taken at all until we flagged Lacey down. The guest greeter Gabby could have very well took our drink order. She was very sweet as well but she could be cross trained to be a helping hand to the waitresses when it's backed up like this night was, maybe a training issue? The booth behind us also complained of the slow service. Do not blame them it was bad.  Anyway, Lacey your awesome at helping us out when you didn't need to. You could have stayed at your station behind the bar. Please Applebee's management speed up your servicing crew. Food is awesome, not so much the speed of service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-antioch-5
Jared S.,"Antioch, CA",57,24,57,2.0,12/2/2017,"Came in with some of my family for a late dinner on Saturday evening. We received all around poor quality service throughout the night. Environment: Typical sports bar type interior. Casual setting with a full bar and a multitude of different seating options. Nothing remarkable, nothing bad. Service: Awful. Just awful. We ordered appetizers and waters to begin. The waters were dirty, so we asked for replacements. The waters came a full 40 minutes later after asking 3 times. The Appetizer was a sampler with a dip that should have come with chips. The chips did not come until we asked for them twice. Two managers had to come around and take care of our needs. We finally ordered our food a full 50 minutes after taking our seats. The food finally arrived 1 hour and 30 minutes after sitting. I was honestly so tired of dealing with the employees I just gave up, ate some, paid, and left. There was a game charge added to our bill that we didn't request or add, this had to be removed by a manager, extending our stay to a total of 2 hours and 30 minutes.  Food: The appetizers were decent but certainly not spectacular. My sisters steak was cold. My steak was ordered medium rare and came out medium well. If you have a lot of time to burn and don't care too much about quality or service, you might find yourself here. Otherwise avoid it. Bonus: May come back for the Dollar Long Island Ice Teas, they were pretty good Edit: They comped us for the appetizers for the service issues so I'll change from 1 star to 2 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-antioch-5
Alejandra C.,"Pittsburg, CA",39,13,2,1.0,10/19/2017,"WORST FOOD EVER!!  My husband, daughter and I had dinner there, first of all, the menus were completely full of sticky stuff.   We order our food (2 for $20).  We asked for a steak, mine medium well, my husband's well-done, when the food arrived my steak was so raw (blood coming out) and my husband's steak was really pink in the middle.   Service was so bad.   As I mentioned, We order the 2 for $20 and my Daughter had a kids meal! When we got the check, to our surprise, we were charged $87.  They offered you things but they don't mention that all those things are extra charge!   To make matters worse my husband and I have tummy problems now!!   I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO APPLEBEES!!

Von Christopher L.,"Hayward, CA",60,3,,2.0,9/18/2017,"BEWARE OF THE LATE NIGHT BAD SERVICE! This is probably my last time ever eating or ordering here.  22:30  Service - 0/5 - Waitress checked on my table twice the whole time and that's counting the time she came with drinks and to take my order. Passed my table over 10 times as I sat there waiting for her. It wasn't as if there were more people or anything. She only had two tables to wait.  Food - 2/5- I order the same thing every time. The four cheese mac with chicken. It's gotten worse every time. This particular time, it was cold flavorless noodles, with mildly warm  burnt crispy chicken on top. Management - 3/5- -at least the manager did all in his power to replace the food and make it a bit better, I guess.

Had to get the bus boy and he didn't bring it out then our server finally brought it over. My salad came out without any dressing. Had to wave down our sever and she never came back with it and went on her break. The girl that took over was very sweet but still took time to come out with my dressing.

Kat D.,"Pittsburg, CA",53,270,62,2.0,8/16/2016,Double date night wasn't super successful. As we were waiting for menus (took 5 minutes just to get them) I knew we should have went to Chili's. But we were already here so we figured we might as well stay. Service was incredibly slow. It took 10 minutes just to get the beers we ordered. They weren't even draft. 10 minutes for 2 bottles of beer. Looking over at the bar and the waiters and one bar tender are in a full blown conversation.  The food was bla... My side salad looked sad. Wilted lettuce and too much dressing. Hubby had mac and 4 cheese. He said he got the mac but no cheeses. The steaks were tough and flavorless.

And the store manager Louis has me at a loss for words. His etiquette is a complete disgrace to restaurant management.

But the last couple times we have been to Applebee's in Antioch have been a nightmare. Tonight we went six of us. They told us 35 minutes. We waited 45 and were told we probably wouldn't be seated for another half an hour. It is clear that this restaurant does not want our business. It's clear that there are not enough servers to handle the few people that are going to dinner there. We offered to sit at two different tables just so we could be seated.

She asked me if I wanted to return my steak but I was too hungry at the moment.  I added lotssss of A1 sauce to give it flavor.

But what I am writing about is how welcoming they are to me and my Service Dog. A lot of places gives SD handlers a hard time and since I've started taking my Service Dog places with me it's always good in my book when no one's giving me a hard time or distracting my dog from his work.

Terrible service, terrible food, and one bout of food poisoning.  There are tons of other food options directly in the same shopping center as this Applebee's.

Bobby L.,"San Francisco, CA",0,2,,2.0,10/31/2017,"We were looking for sizzler resturantBut I guess it had closed up so we seen an applebee's Good home town cooking And yes the food was great as usual ,but .....The service was absolutely horrible ! Granted everyone and every place has a bad day so please keep this in mind as I write this review So I walked in the door It was greeted about 2 minutes later from a nice Young man who escorted us to a booth at the far end he said that was the only booth available we said we would wait for another one but he basically insisted that we set there , So we did .Shortly after that we realized why no one was sitting at that booth the phone was directly behind us within the 1st 5 minutes it rang over and over and over probably 10 times When the young man came by again we asked him if we could move to a different spot he replied that he was very busy and short handed that he didn't have time to do that for us but that our server would be able to help us when she got there .10 minutes later and I mean 10 minutes our server came to us asked us what we would want to drink My wife's reply to him was could we please move into another booth he replied I'll see what I can do and never returned At this time it had been over 20 minutes that we were inside of applebee's and didn't even get a drink .We just got up and moved to the bar .We should have stayed at the booth and put up with the service there and the phone ringing ,Because literally even sitting at the bar we waited another 10 minutes for our 1st 2 drinks which by the way were excellent I had a margherita silver patronne on the rocks with no salt I believe my wife had some sort of lemonade Non alcohol .Now get this part 10 minutes later we asked if we could order some appetizers as she never came to us after she brought the 1st drinks which by the way were empty at that point .We ordered our appetizers the sampler plate which really looked great that's all it did as we got that 7 or 8 minutes after our food arrived ,Once again not to be repetitive all of the food was great we took the appetizers home for our dog . Maybe we'll go back and try again another day like I said sometimes people or places have a bad day this was just our experience there.

Vickie R.,"Antioch, CA",2,107,,1.0,8/24/2016,"This must be the WORSE Applebees in their whole chain of restaurants. I can't understand it. The service here is so bad. We stopped going years ago because we got sick and tired of walking into this place and basically being ignored.  Typical Antioch Applebee's Experience: You walk into the restaurant and can literally stand there for 15 min or more without one person acknowledging you. They SEE you but for some reason appear to feel that if no one talks to you, you just might go away, making their lives much easier. Once you do get seated, it takes another good 15 min OR MORE to get a server to approach your table.  Then once you do order, it takes forever to get the food and it's SO inconsistent, sometimes good sometimes bad, you're  left wondering why you bothered. This scenario happened many times to us until we just decided to give up. So we stopped going.   It was so bad that it scared us off of going to any Applebees anywhere until not long ago, while visiting some friends in Lodi,  we wound up at their local Applebees for lunch and couldn't believe the difference. Fantastic service and food. We were amazed!  We thought maybe things have changed for the better so we decided to give  Antioch Applebee's another try. WRONG!  Same old story but this time we didn't bother to wait around for the food. We just left. NEVER again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-antioch-5?start=20
Candice S.,"Antioch, CA",9,292,,4.0,4/24/2016,"I can't believe I'm actually giving an Applebee's a 4-star review. This must be a fluke. It has to be right? Upon entrance we were warmly greeted and seated right away. Our server was courteous and accommodating of my father and I's apparent physical disabilities. The interior of this location underwent a huge update as did management and menu design. It felt a bit more hip and keeping up with the trends. I enjoyed seeing the pride they have for their local high schools by displaying pictures of the high school athletes everywhere. My dad and I opted for the 2 for $20 meal. 1 appetizer + 2 entrees. Pretty sweet deal. We got the spinach and artichoke dip as an appetizer. It was very filling, but lacked a fresh artichoke flavor. Regardless, we damn near cleared our the ramekin. He ordered the chicken bourbon with shrimp and I ordered the lemon glazed grilled chicken. His order came with fried russet potatoes on the side. His only comment was that the chicken was way overcooked, but that it had a great flavor. I enjoyed the lemon glaze on mine and found the grilled chicken to be perfectly cooked and moist. My dish also came with a side of rice pilaf/quinoa and small (very small) chunks of apple, cranberries and celery for texture. It only needed a teensy bit more apple to balance out the bitter-sweetness of the cranberries. Overall, our experience was very satisfactory and I may actually consider coming back.

What I don't understand is that...it wasn't even that busy and they managed to screw up my entire order and visit. I ordered a strawberry LIMEADE. Got a strawberry LEMONADE.  Ordered a 2 for $25 meal... asked for the ribs and it usually comes with coleslaw and fries, ended up getting broccoli and mashed potatoes. I'm not complaining but it's just funny how my order was messed up.  The third strike, I asked the server to put everything on a gift card and then the rest on cash, she does the complete opposite and so we had to wait for her to fix it. She ended up fixing it but shorted us some change, so we had to wait AGAIN. We asked to talk to the manager and he ended up fixing it for us but had an excuse that they were really busy.

Vinny M.,"Antioch, CA",17,2,3,1.0,1/20/2017,"Racial profiling and employees steeling money off gift cards.    First of all, I never care to leave reviews. I feel it's a waist of time as I run my own business and would rather spend free time with my family.  First bad experience happened a few days before Christmas. I sat at the bar to watch the warriors play. I found out they had a deal,  buy a $50 gift card, you get an extra $10 gift card that had to be used in the month of Jan.  I told the bartender, I wanted two $50 gift cards and gave her my credit card. She left, came back, handed me the phone and said we just have to verify this is your card. Now, I'm on the phone with someone, asking for my name, my mothers maiden name and the last 4 of my social security number. After I answered those questions the guy on the phone, says ok let me see if those are correct.  A red flag went off, usually they know right away if you answered correct or not. I asked the bartender who she called, she said the number on the back of my card, then she told me just to hang up. I asked if she can show proof of who she called. She said she couldn't because she dialed the number in the back in the kitchen. As far as I know I just gave out personal information to some random person over the phone. They said they had to call to make sure the amount was going to go through, I said it's a credit card, you'd know right away if it was going to go through.. I called my cc company to see if they received a call about verification. I was relived that they did, but still irritated about the entire situation. I asked the manager Luis, why couldn't they just ask to see my ID like the standard thing to do. His reply was that people have fake ID's. I ended up just getting the gift cards and leaving right after. I never in my life had a situation like this happen.  I ended up going back Jan 15th. After my meal, I gave the waitress, Megan  a $50 gift card and the two $10 gift cards. She gave me back one of the $10 gift cards and said I can only use one per visit. No problem, sign the receipt and tipped her and left.  Now today, Jan 20th after my meal, I gave the waiter the $50 gift card and the other $10 bonus card. He came back and said the balance was 0 on the $10 gift card and only $12 on my $50 gift card. I asked to talked to the manager and Luis came over.  I told him the situation last time I came in, the waiter taking both $10 cards and giving me back this one, that should of had $10 still on it and mentioned that I should have $25 out of the $50 gift card. I showed him proof of my receipt from last time and he said there nothing he can do about it. I asked him if he could just talk to the waiter since it was just a few days ago, but nothing.  Its not even all about the money it's about the principle, I'm showing proof and for a manager to basically shrug his shoulder and say he can't help, made me write this review. I told him it's fine, everything happens for a reason, paid for my meal and left.  I like apple bee's but I'll never go back to this one, I'd rate them 0 stars if I could. This place needs to work on their customer service, stealing money off gift cards and the entire experience with having to talk to someone from my credit card company just to use it, is ridiculous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-antioch-5?start=20

Camilo B.,"Pittsburg, CA",1,6,,1.0,4/3/2017,"Regardless of the time or day my wife and I visit, the service is always very slow and sometimes rude. While the food is fine, common Applebee's fare, the service has really turned us off this restaurant. About a year ago, we were eating when a fight broke out between two different tables and the people started throwing steak knives at each other. The manager handled the crazy situation as best she could, and stayed professional in the middle of chaos. But, the overall feel of the restaurant is low quality, and this just reinforced that! We have only been back once since that time, and nothing had changed. I don't think we will be back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-antioch-5?start=20

Food prices are pretty reasonable. Their Onion Rings and Fried String Beans wasn't strained so there was small puddle of grease on the bottom the tray, else it was flavored well and the dipping sauces were excellent. Their shrimp linguine had good flavor but it had a bit too much olive oil (reminds me of Hell's Kitchen when Chef Ramsey tilts the plate and you can pour the olive oil on a napkin, but it wasn't that extreme) Their strawberry ice tea is something I will avoid; but if you like strawberry syrup added to your ice tea, then you'll like it",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-antioch-5?start=20

Having been in the business of dealing with people all my life I find allot to be desired about it here. After being seated we sat about 15 minutes before being greeted or even acknowledged by any one. There were 4 empty tables in our area we were seated. Throughout the meal, we saw our wait person once. It was only after the hostess came by that our drinks were even refilled.  This service is similar to service we have received in two prior visits.

Mary-Christine V.,"Winston, OR",130,5,,1.0,8/24/2017,"We arrived at around 7:50 PM on August 17th with a party of 8.  We waited about 10 minutes to be seated in a booth.  The restaurant was not busy at all, and there were a whole row of empty tables.  We received our menus and ordered our drinks and the rest of our meal.  After waiting about 15 minutes, 2 people in our party were given their salads.  The rest of us just sat there while they ate.  15 minutes later, 2 more people in our party were given their salads.  I was still left without a salad, so my husband spoke up to the waiter and told her that we were still missing a salad, and the waiter replied, ""The kitchen is backed up, so it will be just a little longer"".  We have eaten at MANY Applebee's, and have always had the salads served at the same time.  We had the same issue with our entrees.  Everyone was served except for my husband and me.  By the time we received our food, everyone else had already eaten.  Our two entrees were COLD! My husband asked to speak to the manager, who was not the LEAST bit helpful.  He apologized, and told us that he would give us 10% off my husband's and my food (not the whole order).  We explained that our food was cold, and the waitress near us was chatting away to people she must have known, instead of helping refill iced tea, etc.  Our waitress took away our cold food   to have it remade.  We told her to put it in to-go boxes as our family had already eaten, and we didn't want to have everyone wait on us.  Meanwhile, 1 person in our party just received his wings appetizers (it was now 9:00), and he told the waiter that he didn't want to be charged the regular price since it was now Happy Hour.  He asked for an order of the same wings to go since he was starving by the time he got the wings.  We had to ask for refills of our iced tea, and several of us didn't even get refills.  We got our two boxed up meals, and the person who ordered the wings got the wrong wing order!!!  He just sent them back, and didn't bother to reorder.  When we received the bill, we noticed that after this horrible dinner, we were only given $5 off the bill!!!  My husband again asked to speak to the manager.  Husband told the manager that this was a horrible experience, and $5 off the tab was not going to cut it.  The manager said that he would speak with the general manager, and get back with us. He came back and removed $20 more off the bill.  This was still unacceptable, so my husband went back to speak with another one of the managers, who informed us that the general manager was not on site!!!  The other manager (male) had lied to us!  This other manager (female) ended up giving us a $40 gift certificate to an Applebee's of our choice and $60 off of our bill.  She made things right.  This entire time, that same waitress was chatting away with customers and other employees.  Horrible, horrible experience!  In all the Applebee's where we have eaten, this was the WORST.  Never had this happen at any other Applebee's, and will never eat at this particular establishment again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-antioch-5?start=40

I've been here many times and have always had a good experience. Our waiter was Mohammad, boy was he very polite, attentive and on point! He brought our drinks out to us in record time I think! The food was served hot, fresh and appealing. The place was loud with conversations going on everywhere but hey, its the 'Neighborhood Grill & Bar' right?! It was nice to hear the laughter. I felt like I didn't have to ssuuuush my kids because they were being too loud. The 24ct boneless buffalo were eaten as a meal instead of appetizers. Demolished by my 15yo! I had only one (as he gave me the evil eye if I ate any more), the sauce was hot and chicken was moist and fresh. Hubby had the Bacon Cheeseburger. Demolished! The patty was a bit thin for his liking but he stated he was full after wards. I ordered the Roast Beef bacon & mushroom and Swiss Sammy. I devoured it! The roast beef was thinly sliced and plentiful. The mushrooms were sauteed and placed over the thick slices of perfectly cooked bacon. The sourdough bread was lightly toasted and didn't get all soggy. Or maybe it didn't get soggy because I didn't put it down long enough!?! I would order it again. The birthday boy ordered the Kids Mac n' Cheese. A very simple plate of just that. No sides came with it. When we ordered milk with it, it comes in a sealed milk bottle.

But, if you stick with the soup and salad you can get a decent meal. Fries are good too if they bring them out quick. I like the bartenders, but service is super slow.

My sides were mac and cheese, which was another disappointment, no flavor at all , i hated it, and it's costs extra as a side? what nerve. I ordered a milkshake and they gave my husband the wrong flavor. To their credit they gave him another one at no charge and told him to keep the other one too. However, another disappointment. They don't use real whipped cream. You get a better milkshake at the drive thru, at least they use real whipped cream. They use that synthetic tasting kind.The onion rings were pretty good though. Hubby said his burger was just ok. Next time we want to take out i can guarantee it won't be at Applebee's.

Joyce K.,"Contra Costa County, CA",1,42,4,1.0,6/20/2016,"Went last night for Fathers Day dinner around 9pm. NEVER COMING BACK. Let me say that our server Julie L was very sweet & the manager did comp our meal $11, but here's what we got: initially ignored while standing in lobby waiting to be seated. Bartender makes eye contact a number of times, says nothing. Wait staff see us, looks around then goes back to their own business. We look around: there are about 10-12 tables/booths with customers & the rest of the restaurant is completely empty. We wait still getting looks but not a single staff person saying, ""someone will be right there"" or acknowledging us at all for a while longer before we start talking about trying somewhere else. Just as we're about to leave, a very polite & courteous young guy comes out from somewhere in the back & gives us menus & seats us. Julie L comes to the table with a smile & introduces herself then takes our order for drinks & appetizers while we look at menu. Hubby orders a margarita on the rocks, received margarita blended. He very politely shows Julie, who apologizes as she says she wrote on the rocks on the ticket & takes away the blended drink to return with one on the rocks. Hubby takes one sip, stirs the ice & sees ***DEAD FLY*** in the drink. I'm grossed out & want to leave immediately but he says to give them a chance bec it's our first time eating here. We flag Julie down, she apologizes & brings hubby new drink which he says is much better so we stay. Our appetizers arrive & they're hot & fresh. We give our order (Parmesan shrimp steak: medium rare, smoked double steaks: rare & egg: over medium) to Julie, who asks what sides my husband wants with his meal (baked potato & 4-cheese mac), then she leaves. She comes back later to ask me what sides I want with my meal because she didn't realize my meal came with 2 sides. So I order crispy bacon cheddar potatoes & mashed sweet potatoes & ask what soups they have tonight then order the French onion soup. She leaves while we eat our appetizers. She comes back again when we're halfway done to say they're out of the French onion soup, so I order the steak & black bean soup instead. A while later, the manager comes out (we assume she's the manager because she's in orange but never introduces herself) pauses to look at us before saying: ""Sorry about the fly in your drink. We really do try our best to get the flies out every morning (YUCK, had that fly been sitting in their ice or on a table since this morning???). We're also out of the mashed sweet potatoes & garlic mashed potatoes. And I know you ordered the French onion soup & were told that we're out of it, but we're also out of the steak & bean soup too but we do have tomato basil & tortilla chicken instead."" So I order the 4-cheese mac instead & agree to try the chicken tortilla soup. By now, I'm feeling like the guy on Sesame Street trying to order food at Grover's restaurant & something's always off. My soup arrives with our meals (it's hot, spicy & tasty) delivered by two other ppl. I start in on my soup when I look at my husband & he's staring at his plate. No shrimp Parmesan on the steak, broccoli in place of baked potato (the manager said only that they were out of all mashed potatoes so what happened?) & his steak looks well-done. At this point, we decide to just eat what's there instead of wasting more time sending it back so we flag Julie down & tell her that's not what we ordered. She looks at it & says, ""oh, you ordered the Parmesan shrimp... Do you want them to put some on top of your steak or serve some on the side?"" She's trying at least. We say no & just want to make sure we're not charged for the higher costing meal & she says that the manager will comp our bill. So we say okay & start eating. I eat most of my soup before starting on my meal: tiny egg on top with the yolk popped & pooled under the steak. Oh well. I cut into the steak, it's just okay tasting. Second bite the same. Go for third bite: *raw meat* the meat was still blue, shiny tendons... Inedible. Switch to corners of same steak & get only one bite before it's the same on the other side. Set all that aside & start on second 4oz piece: I only get just the two corners: raw, raw, raw inside. I have over 30+ yrs of experience with the difference between raw/blue & rare. Please don't even try to say that those steaks were cooked. I just pushed them aside & stopped eating at this point while hubby powered through his well-done, dry plain steak. The 4-cheese mac was okay on both our plates. Julie come back & says that the manager feels bad about our experience & would like to offer us a free dessert. At this point we just want to try to leave gracefully so we decline. Julie brings us our bill = my meal comped -$6, hubby's DEAD FLY MARGARITA= free, hubby's wrong meal comped -$5. With the other drinks & appetizers (apps @ happy hour prices) plus tip we paid +$65 for a memorably awful Fathers Day dinner.  Should've checked the Yelps before we stopped here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-antioch-5?start=60

Kimmy E.,"Antioch, CA",1,2,2,1.0,12/17/2014,"Honestly, my boyfriend and I are VERY patient and understanding when it comes to dining out. Working and running a restaurant business before, we understand that sometimes mistakes happen and service can be backed up due to how busy the restaurant is. But this time was just beyond HORRIBLE! This month, we've came about 2 times hoping that the service would be better, but it got worse and worse each time. The second time was the absolute WORST service we've ever received anywhere! Experience #1: We came in and waited a while to get seated, but it wasn't a big deal because we figured that the host might be busy with Togos (totally understandable, no biggy). When we were seated there were only two other tables, it was not busy at all. It took our waiter about 10 minutes to finally acknowledge us, but he nice so we let it go. We ordered our food and I ordered a Midori Sour (blended). The drink was made on the rocks, so I kindly told him that I had ordered it blended. Instead of re-making it, the bartender just added more ice and blended it and it tasted so diluted and watered down. It literally tasted like shaved ice with a hint of lemon. I didn't want to make our server take it back again, so we accepted it and moved on (Maybe next time, right?). Our food comes out and the pasta was super dry so I asked for more Alfredo sauce on the side. It took 20 minutes for them to bring out the sauce, at that point my boyfriend had already finished his meal so we just packed mine togo. This wasn't such a great experience, but seeing that the waiter was nice and probably trying his best left it alone and hoped for a better experience next time. WRONG! Experience #2: We came in and got seated right away. The restaurant felt so empty. There was two customers at the bar and about 3 other tables besides our table in the entire place. The waitress was VERY RUDE. The food was came out so slow and she got one of our order wrong. We didn't mind that it was wrong, but she was very rude about it.  When the rest of our food came out the Rib-let basket looked like leftovers from another table (see picture). The dish was messy and there was very little fries. The waitress noticed this too and said she would be back with more fries (never did). We asked for more water for everyone and before we could finish our sentence she was already walking away from our table and turned around with a quick ""UH-HUH, yeah"". Overall, the waitress' tone, attitude, and service was horrible. To us, it felt like she didn't even want to be there.  Our friends and families have told us that the service and environment has changed drastically and we should've listened to them. We will NOT be coming back to this location. I hope the management does something fast because the place is getting worse and worse. It used to be so packed and lively and now it's completely washed out.  Now don't get me wrong, not all their waiters and waitresses are bad.

Me and my girlfriend visited this location on February 13th, 2014.       We walked into this establishment and waited at the podium to be seated by a hostess; after two minutes of making eye contact with numerous servers ""vii"" finally came to greet us, she told us it would be a five minute wait to sitdown and we had no problem with that. About three minutes passed by until we were seated to look over the menu.  After we were seated we waited 10 minutes for a waiter to greet us and take our drink order. We noticed tables around us were being serviced while we were not.         We happend to notice ""vii"" walking by and asked her why haven't we been serviced yet. Her response was ""the kitchen is currently backed up, it will be 20 minutes before anything comes out, we aren't even seating anybody at this moment so they can catch up on orders"".     After she said that line to us she walked off without us having a chance to respond.    Me and my girlfriend walked out right after that. As soon as we were walking out another hostess was sitting a family down.  The kitchen being backed up has noting to do with a waiter coming to our table or serving us drinks. The table behind us, in front of us  and to the side of us was being serviced but not us.

Tonight was the LAST STRAW.  I ordered a side salad and potsticker appetizers and my husband a chicken dish. They brought out my food first even though we wanted them to bring them out together, and promised the chicken would be ""right up""; however, after I was through with my salad (and not through the postickers because they were awful!), they told us there was a problem and the manager would be right over. We told them forget it, I had already eaten and my husband, no longer wanted to wait. We paid the bill, which was $28 for 2 appetizers and 2 beers! And low and behold, the manager just hid behind the bar. NEVER has a manager apologized to us for the many times they've messed up our orders. In a GOOD restaurant the manager would've been falling over us apologizing offering to comp the whole tab, but as I left and peered over at the manager, she just sunk below the machine at the bar.   Do not waste your time or your money!  I don't usually write reviews like this, but after 10+ years of this, I've had enough.  No more chances Applebee's, and I guaranty I'll be writing to the corporate office.  This is the worst restaurant in Antioch for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-antioch-5?start=100

And if you look at my record of reviews and see the massive list of five stars I've thrown around, you know I REALLY hate to say this. But I can totally see why this place only has two stars. We went for my step sister's birthday, and I know she and her friends are rude and not very patient, but I was running out steam trying to protect the server, whom I knew personally from high school. Maybe they were just having a bad night, I want to say, ignoring the glaring two star total the business is sporting. But seriously, we were only supposed to be there for an hour and a half. Instead, we WAITED FOR FOOD for over an hour. Finally the food came out and the birthday girl's mother had her order wrong (although she didn't have him correct it, but maybe she was afraid to wait another hour). That bitch is no peach, so on a $70 bill she left our server $2. Which was so deplorable. I wish I had known before we left. Our server was a great dude and he didn't really do anything wrong. He was very present and on top of things with the drinks, and the place wasn't all that busy so he was constantly moving between the kitchen and his three tables. The lady behind us yelled at him and demanded to see the manager, and my mother and I started talking a little shit about ""people who are bad to service people"" and then that bitch apologized to him when he came back around with the manager. Seriously, I have to say again, it WAS NOT his fault. The kitchen was probably understaffed (or on strike back there, wtf) and there wasn't anything he could do about it. I could tell he was under pressure too, because he tried to save himself by making the birthday girl's dessert HIMSELF. You know there's an issue in the kitchen if the server is suddenly making your food. My mom and I tipped extra, because unlike everybody else at the table we have a shred of sympathy because we actually had to work at our service jobs and put up with bad customers. If I had known my stepmom was going to be such a shady bitch, I would have tipped him even more.

I used to come to this Applebee's all the time for happy hour a few years ago.  The customer service and food quality has gone waaaaaaaaay down!  The place smelled like mildew and it felt humid and disgusting inside.  Maybe it was because it was raining, but nonetheless, felt disgusting.  There were tons of seating but had to wait to be seated.   The food was TERRIBLE!!! We started with an appetizer, the spinach & artichoke dip.  I used to swear by this appetizer.  It was gross.  It was runny, bland, and no cheese to be found.  It was like warm, and the chips were cheap & gross.  I ordered the three cheese chicken penne.  Something I've always ordered when I used to come here, and it was beyond disgusting.  There was definitely not three cheeses in the dish.  The sauce was runny, kind of a clear gross looking substance, with watery uncooked tomatoes & overcooked pasta.  I ordered my son chicken tenders which were damn near burnt with a side house salad which had wilted lettuce.  My husband ordered honey lime chicken & shrimp with mashed potatoes and green beans.  The green beans were undercooked.   However, our waitress was surprisingly pleasant.  She's the only reason we tipped the place. Why did we stay & pay you ask?!  Because I was starving & pregnant! Anyway, don't come to this sorry excuse of an eating establishment.  Save yourself some money and the trouble of having to tip and go to Jack in the Box instead.  You'll surely get more consistency!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-antioch-5?start=100

I stood at the empty hostess stand for a few minutes and waited while no one came to greet me or even acknowledge me. One server walked past me while taking another group of guests to their table. Finally, after cleaning a table, another server came to seat me and provide with a menu but did not take a drink order. When my boyfriend joined me, I said I was unable to get a head start on a drink order because the server didn't stop by. Finally two different servers walked past our table to bring food to two different tables. We decided to move to the bar since a bartender was there. When we got up to leave, one of the servers who had set food down at a nearby table but stayed to chat with the table said: is something wrong?  What a joke. We received no acknowledgement the whole time we were seated until we get up to move. I understand chatting with patrons and being friendly but we were not acknowledged at all. Not even a: I'll be right with you or someone will be right with you. Until that moment, I didn't even know that server saw us. We would have walked out if we weren't so hungry and if we had another nearby sit down option still open for dinner.  Bar was fine. We were given the minimum service in that we were asked for drinks and our food order but we had to ask for refills...while at the bar. Food was ok: I ordered the grilled chicken Caesar and he ordered the steak and shrimp. He said his tasted like a microwave dinner.

I went here specifically for happy hour a few weeks back, only because they seem to actually make some decent drinks and the Mozzarella cheese sticks are not that bad   however, I was left with a sour taste (not from the food ) but from the same old horrible service I seem to encounter time after time...I mean from the clueless hostess to the extremely bitchy bartender that we unfortunately encountered twice, it was all an absolute joke.....10 min for a hostess to get us our menu as well as to waive the waitress down to let her know we have been waiting for the last 10 min but, what really threw it off was the attitude my friend and I received from the extremely unhappy bartender. I had asked for some extra pomegranate juice to be added to my Pom Martini only because there was such a scare amount and she completely gives me an attitude from hell...this went on for the next  1/2 hour that we were there...no tip from me sweetie....yup..No deserve!

I was very surprised by the foul language from the loud music and all of the families that had kids with them.  It really blew me away.  Maybe I am getting too old, but I thought a restaurant should do something unique such as serve good food with peace and quiet. My daughter's cajun pasta with shrimp was horrible.  No sauce, no spice, and very bland.  She even found veins in the shrimp.  We shared our meals with her so she could get something decent to eat.  We should have sent it back.

Joseph C.,"Chino Hills, CA",57,15,,1.0,7/7/2014,"My family and I recently moved to northern California from southern California. Down south we frequented out neighborhood Applebee's every other week. One night, after a trip to the emergency room with our 4 year old daughter, we stopped here at her request. Let me just say, the difference between our old Applebee's and this one is day and night. We got seated quickly, but that was the only good thing about this visit. Took forever for our server to get our drink order and even longer for him to come back and take our food order. We ordered an appetizer with our drinks, because my daughter was starving. Drinks came out about 15 minutes later with no appetizer. After we finally ordered our food it took, and I am not exaggerating, 45 minutes for it to come out. Still no appetizer mind you, and the entrees that did come out were cold. I said something to our server when he took so long to come back to take our order. He came up with some BS story about being short staffed and three people walking out on top of that. When the food came out cold, I couldn't take it anymore. We spoke with the manager, who came up to the table, grabbed a chair and sat there staring at us. He just looked at is for a good 40 seconds, before i finally started talking. He tried using an excuse of them being super busy and one person had called out. He asked if they could remake our orders, but we declined because it was late, my daughter was hungry, and I told him we didn't feel like waiting another hour before fresh food came out. He didn't really seem to care and didn't offer any other solution to the problem. Well, he did remover the appetizer from the bill. But WE NEVER GOT THE APPETIZER!

So I looked on line and what great pictures they have and selected a spinach salad, with blue cheese chunks, roasted pecans, roasted chicken ( I am a vegetarian so asked it to be on side to give to girls, strawberries and blueberries. Now if you look at the picture you will see a beautiful salad. When he dropped it off I could not believe what I saw, so I took a picture and it is now my main photo on my profile. I don't even think their was one strawberry and the few blueberries half were rotten. Needless to say I did not eat dinner at all. It looked like the spinach hadn't even been washed. I called the manager and told him what happened he said come back and we will make you another one. I told him I don't drive at night so he said he will send me a coupon for a new salad that I should receive within 3-4 weeks. The coat of this box of spinach was 10.99! I am on a limited budget and that took part of my food allowance for the week. He could of offered to have someone bring the salad to me.. I would of preferred a credit so I could have money for food this week. So look at my picture and then go to their website and tell me if you think I got ripped off. My little chihuahua's did enjoy their chicken! Don't go there! The service is terrible.

K F.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",151,2,,1.0,4/1/2011,"Total disappointment! I recently went to the Concord Applebee's and was thrilled with the food and service. Then I made a huge mistake in going to the Antioch location off of Hillcrest Ave.  Walking in, there was no one even there to greet the four of us so we stood up front for a good 5 minutes before a young girl walked up to finally get us a seat. Mind you this same girl was chatting with what looked to be friends while we waited for her attention. Once she gave us a place to sit we waited another 15 minutes for a young man to walk up and say 'what do you want to drink?' Forgive me for saying but what happened to the good customer service of 'Hi, my name is ____ I'll be your server today, can I get you started with something to drink?' Due to the long wait we were ready to order the dinner and the drinks (sodas). To shorten this up a bit, it took another 15 minutes for the drinks to get to the table and after that 30 more for the meals. We arrived at 9:45pm and didn't leave until after 12:20am and got only drinks and some appetizers. Numerous employees past up our table and not one apologized for the wait or even smiled in our direction. Our server gave the guys (obvious friends of his) a free meal that were sitting at the table next to us. They tipped him some cash that he pocketed right in front of us, they shook hands and they left without any shame.  I usually would just walk out on service like that but it was too late to attempt another location and waiting that long for drinks alone made everyone just want to stick it out. We all left extremely irritated. For as many people out there that need jobs, places like this should get rid of the high school kids that have no customer service respect and employ the people who need to pay their mortgages and families.

Buena D.,"San Francisco, CA",8,4,,1.0,1/6/2011,"A couple of friends and I were in Antioch 1/4/11 and decided to go to Applebee's for dinner since we never had problems eating at other Applebee's restaurants before. The restaurant was not crowded at all and we were seated right away. Our waitress came by our table within 10 minutes to take our drink orders. While we were waiting for our drinks, we reviewed their menu deciding what to eat. We decided on the chicken wing appetizer with the sauce on the side, chicken broccoli pasta Alfredo, teriyaki shrimp pasta, combo chicken and shrimp sizzling skillet fajitas, a Caesar salad with dressing on the side and tomato basil soup and garlic bread basket. Within 10 minutes of our order the chicken appetizer arrives (so far so good). 20 minutes later the waitress comes to our table to let me know that they had just run out of tomato basil soup. I then order the rib-lets with no fries since I ordered the Caesar salad. Our food finally arrives 15 minutes later and it looks real good until we taste it. The chicken broccoli pasta Alfredo was so dry that we asked for extra Alfredo sauce which took 15 minutes to heat up so by the time the sauce arrives, the chicken broccoli pasta was cold, yucky!! The only thing sizzling on the fajitas platter was the onions and bell peppers. The chicken was cold and the shrimp half cooked so my friend buried the shrimp under the veg to cook more and she just ate the chicken cold. Her flour tortillas was wrapped in foil and was brick hard and I mean it was hard!!! She couldn't eat it at all. The Teriyaki shrimp pasta was so salty because of the sauce that my friend could not eat it. Her blood pressure would have been off the Richter scale lol. My ""plain"" Caesar salad arrives with a couple of cut up romaine lettuce and 3 tiny croutons. No Parmesan cheese!!! It looked so sad and even sadder was my 2 1/2 small pieces of rib-lets. During our ""unhappy meal"" we told the waitress that we would like to speak to the manager because we were not satisfied with our food and at that the time she informed us that she did speak to the manager to let him know. By common courtesy the manager should have been to our table right away to make things right but he doesn't show up until after the bill was paid for!!! This is beyond ""shitty"" customer service. Oh, by the way the reason the tortillas was brick hard the restaurant uses a microwave to heat up the tortillas instead of heating them on the grill.

In a restaurant? And perhaps prepare in advance for it) After enduring the wait, THE FOOD WAS COLD!!!! Obviously our food sat in the ""busy kitchen"" for some time before being brought out :( Itwas more than apparent that there was a shortage of skilled servers in the building, it seemed more like training camp for potential servers as there was much unorganized running going on with no productive table waiting happening.  The level of service has continued to TANK at this particular location for about the last six months.  We used to frequent weekly, then new management or something came in, we tried to ride out the quirks but stopped going all together after about five attempts for a nice meal.  This was the first time we had been in in about three months.  We were hopeful things would be smoother and more enjoyable by now however, it was just the opposite.  We will not be going back.

Purchased a $50 gift certificate on 12/21/11, but my bank statement showed $55.  Called GM and after reviewing charges, he found $5.00 tip had been added.  NOT BY ME!!!  His reply to me was - my word against hers, call my bank and file fraud!!!BE AWARE ANTIOCH APPLEBEE""S CUSTOMERS - Crooks on staff.  Make sure to fully check bill, leave no blank area when signing credit card receipt AND check your monthly statements.
