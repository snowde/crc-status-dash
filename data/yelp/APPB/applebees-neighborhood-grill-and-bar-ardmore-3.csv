Launie R.,"Ratliff City, OK",0,46,5,3.0,8/7/2017,"Great service, food was ok. My shrimp had some of the shell still on it and the sauce/dressing was too spicy and there was too much of it. My kids enjoyed their food but hey, they're kids so kinda easy to please. I usually like Applebee's but this was not a great experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ardmore-3
Kimberly T.,"Chicago, IL",48,8,,1.0,12/29/2017,"The food was mediocre at best, even for Applebee's. The server could not get a water and unsweet tea order correct, much less our food order. Our server was absolutely terrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ardmore-3
Lisa G.,"Dallas, TX",0,2,1,1.0,11/4/2017,"Went here last night and will never go back!  The food was horrible.  Wonton chicken tacos taste like cat food smells, chicken Mac and cheese had a sweet liquid covering the plate and the grilled chicken had so much seasoning you could not eat it.  We never saw the same waitress twice,   had to ask for my drink from the bar twice and it was wrong when it came out.  We never leave plates of food on the table but we did last night!  I seriously can not believe we paid $70 for food we couldn't eat!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ardmore-3
Jerri B.,"Princeton, TX",0,38,5,2.0,7/24/2017,Always feels a little dirty.  It is overpriced just like all other Applebee's.  This location is next door to a cheap motel so that also takes away from a positive experience.  I do like the options of a few lower calorie dishes and that the calories are listed on the menu.  Not a fan but my older parents like Applebee's so I am a forced to go now and then.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ardmore-3

Jennifer H.,"Lakewood, Dallas, TX",6,24,,1.0,7/27/2016,"Don't waste your time. Unless you're a friend of the server or bartender, you're going to be ignored.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ardmore-3
Diana G.,"Chicago, IL",245,1029,3790,2.0,1/1/2013,"We stopped in late since not much was open around the area. We did the 2 for $20 deal. I would give it like 2.5 stars, but went with 2 since I don't see myself going back. Spinach Artichoke Dip - I thought it was a bit too salty. Chicken Tenders - A bit greasy and honey mustard sauce was ok. Southwest Shrimp Fettuccine - This was ok. Overall, service was good, but I rather go elsewhere to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ardmore-3
Dean W.,"Pauls Valley, OK",68,127,379,5.0,10/17/2014,"They are quite accommodating and usually have fast enough service that you won't be late for any appointments...unless you were ALREADY in crisis mode before you got here! Waitstaff seems totally competent and interested in your happiness. From appetisers and cocktails to entrees and dessert, the food was consistent  and flavourful. Had fun in our group.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ardmore-3
Dave R.,"Ardmore, OK",0,23,,1.0,5/12/2016,I tried this again after years of boycott...the service is still severely lacking.  I didn't stay for dinner-it was THAT BAD!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ardmore-3
Mallorie L.,"Norman, OK",39,1,,1.0,5/26/2016,"terrible.. cheese on kid's pizza was old, ceiling was leaking, and burger undercooked. wouldn't go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ardmore-3
Jonathan C.,"Ardmore, OK",0,13,3,3.0,7/23/2016,"Happy hour with friends was fun. The $3.50 house margaritas were surprisingly great, and the chips and salsa satisfied.  The prices were fair. The problem was the appearance and attitude of some of the employees...one appeared to be either on meth, recovering from a hang over, or needing a shower with strong pumice soap. I will call him Greasy Gary, or GG for short. I know it sounds bad, and I sound insensitive, but this person was dropped off by someone at the front of the restaurant in a car that barely ran and blew smoke from both ends.  GG then proceeded to go to the restroom to put on his dirty Applebee's hat and apron, and likely to wash up a little, then he waddled to the kitchen.  Now maybe he was going to wash dishes, and that would have probably been OK. But the thought that he would be cooking...Uhm yeah.  Now I said some of the employees, and so far I have only mentioned GG. Our waitress was rude, although she was attentive. Our hostesses was mute, although she managed to direct us to the bar area where a group of small children were sitting.  I remember thinking that I was just waiting for someone to look at me and my friends and ask, ""ya'll ain't from around here er ya?"" Long story short, go with a group of friends and focus on how good the food and drinks are. Just don't pay any attention to the quality of employees and you might have a good experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ardmore-3
Cheryl L.,"Reno, NV",0,15,8,3.0,8/11/2015,"Stopped by for a late dinner and drinks with some friends. The food was good, nothing special, and came out as ordered and hot. Drinks were closer to come than they should have been and were on the slightly high average side on price. There was a decent variety however.  The service, however, was rather poor. We had trickled in so by the time we had everyone, the table was too small for the group. We asked if we could move to another table close by that was large enough to fit all of us but was currently dirty. Instead, we were moved to another table that was larger but still not large enough to comfortably fit seven people. Why the first table couldn't simply have been cleaned off for us is unknown. Waitress also had a bit of an attitude and while wasn't explicitly rude, wasn't particularly courteous either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ardmore-3
Sarah L.,"Ardmore, OK",8,3,,5.0,12/21/2015,Went in to try it out with my husband and I were both very impressed. The wait staff was excellent we got mark as our waiter and he was very friendly and took care of us. My steak was perfect and my husband's shrimp was cooked perfectly and the bartender Neil was very good at what he does I had to meet him and give him a tip. One of the best bartenders I've ever had.  So I will be going back whenever I have the chance!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ardmore-3
Christeene D.,"Sulphur, OK",14,13,4,3.0,5/20/2015,"After a long day at the Dr's office me and my husband met up here to eat dinner.  Because of storms I am assuming,  the place was pretty dead. We were seated immediately.  Hostess was pleasant enough.  After sitting down I realized that it was so cold that it felt like a meat locker in there.  I mentioned this two or three times to the waiter throughout the meal.  There never was a change even though I was reassured they had. Waiter had even explained that the previous customers sitting in the booth ahead of us threatened to leave because it was to cold.   We ordered the Won Ton Tacos as a appetizer and they were delicious.  Husband got the half slab of ribs and I got the Parmesan shrimp steak medium with loaded baked potato and broccoli vegetable mix.  Husbands food was great and my steak was good.  The Parmesan cheese on top of my steak was so hard I couldn't even cut it with a knife so I pulled it off.  The broccoli was cold and the loaded baked potato had no butter on it or sour cream but other than that the food was very good.   Now,  onto the music coming from the juke box.  The employees were putting music on it and the whole time we were there I felt as if I was at a Rave.  Ugh... Thump, thump,  thump,  it was hideously loud and every TV in the place was on a infomercial channel for airbrush makeup even though severe weather was in the area.  Very distracting.   The waiter was very personable and did a good job. I only gave three stars due to the issues stated here. All of these issues are simple fixes.  Will we go back and give it another chance?  Not sure,  maybe but I can guarantee I will take a jacket.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ardmore-3
Jay K.,"Piedmont, OK",33,13,,4.0,10/22/2014,"Service was great, food was expected.  Nick the bartender had good personality, even when waiting on patron who was belligerent about making sure Nick knew the World Series was going to be on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ardmore-3
Angel W.,"Carrollton, TX",25,14,,4.0,6/22/2014,I had the strawberry and avocado grilled chicken salad with the clili lime vinegarette dressing which was great.  My husband's steak was flavorful but chewy.  The service was pretty good so overall this was better than most Applebee's I've been too!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ardmore-3
Jerry Y.,"Dallas, TX",42,306,,3.0,12/29/2011,"I stopped off at this location on the way to Wichita over Christmas.  The place was very busy but the service was a little slow.  My food was fine but other members of my party said some of their items were cold. Giving 3 stars because of my food experience, but really disappointed how slow the service was.  If you're traveling and looking for a place to sit down for a quick bite you might want to consider another place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ardmore-3
Dennis M.,"Ardmore, OK",10,62,3,5.0,1/23/2013,"Received a gift card and decided to try once again. For the life of me I don't how this place stays open. We did the 2 for 20. We got the queso and chips and it was good. I got just the 7oz house steak and mashed potatoes. I wonder if this place has changed the heat lamp for food waiting to be served or have they ever timed how long food that comes off the grill to when it's served. My food was so cold, I thought they pulled it out of the refrigerator. I've tried this place for the last time. Just glad it was free meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ardmore-3
Gary W.,"Wylie, TX",0,9,,1.0,7/14/2014,"Long wait for ordering and getting food, overcooked my ribs, not enough sauce for how dry they were, the extra sauce I ordered was cold, screwed up my wife's very simple order (long wait for that too), and lousy service.

Tracey W.,"Richardson, TX",115,131,,2.0,1/14/2009,"Well, my co-worker and I were headed to OKC for a class on some new software and thought we'd just stop in Ardmore since it was getting late in the day and grab something pretty quick to eat...okay, really??  We could have ordered, eaten and been on our way from the Burger King faster even if we'd went inside.  The service (although it was the middle of the afternoon and there was not an overabundance of wait staff) was a little slower than we'd have cared for.  How long does it really take to fix 4 little sliders and some chips and dip??  Our waitress was apparently doubling as the bartender and seemed to pay more attention to those people than the tables she was supposed to be waiting on.  Slightly disappointing...but on a good note, they did have a hockey game on one of the TVs! :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ardmore-3?start=20
