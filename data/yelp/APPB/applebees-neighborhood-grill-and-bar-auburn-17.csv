b. l.,"Auburn, CA",0,25,,3.0,3/4/2011,"This is Applebee's.  This is the also-ran among TGI Friday's and Bennigan's.  If you haven't eaten at Applebees, then you should set your expectations low.  It's a kind of sport's bar, greasy food, lower middle age chain.  Once you accept you're going to Applebee's, this place is good. They serve beer for cheap prices in the late evening. They serve beer and food until *MIDNIGHT* (as of early 2011), later than anywhere else in north Auburn and later than anything other than Denny's (on I-80) within a 20 minute drive.  The wait staff and managers are pleasant and don't complain bitterly if you come in after 11pm like in some other joints that have no customers.  If you don't want to watch sports TV, you are out of luck. There are a zillion screens and there's no table where you can avoid looking at one. Their musak cycle is a pretty mid quality rock-to-pop stream, lots of top hits from the 1960s to the 2000s.  Fries and beer until midnight in closed-at-9pm Auburn, those who complain about this place are confused about what else is available. If you think you're going out to a fine dining experience or you don't understand that 20 year old wait staff are new to the profession and will make errors or perhaps you are deciding between eating Applebee's and a better chain, go somewhere else. If you want a beer and fries or maybe a cheap, oily appetizer after 9pm on a weekday in Auburn-area-foothills, this is your only non-Denny's choice. Enjoy it or stay home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-17?start=40

Riana H.,"Yuba City, CA",0,11,,2.0,2/17/2014,"Before I get into the negative I would like to talk about the positives. The service was very good. Our server was very nice and asks if we needed anything a couple of times. The other servers also paid close attention to make sure we had everything we needed. Sadly the food did not compare to the service. Well, two out of the four entrees we ordered were burnt. One of the entrees was a chicken dish and the whole bottom of the chicken breast was burnt a similar problem occurred with one of the other entrees sadly the second entree was completely overlooked and somewhat burnt. Even though the service was great the food didn't meet out expectations. If one person doesn't enjoy their food it destroys the whole experience.

Brittany M.,"Grass Valley, CA",2,67,,4.0,2/14/2012,"I've eaten at this Applebee's multiple times with my husband and I have to say it really isn't all that bad - at least when we've been there. The service is always consistently decent, the food is consistently what you'd expect from an average Applebee's - not overly greasy, but nothing life changing or amazing - pretty standard, average American cuisine. It's always a bit pricey, but we get the 2 for $20 deal. The appetizers are always very good. We've always left here feeling like we had a decent meal for the price. I will say their alcoholic drinks taste like there's hardly any alcohol at all... but oh well. Overall, it's a good place to go if you don't feel like cooking every now and then.

I substituted a green salad for the cole slaw because their cole slaw is gross.  My ribs were disgusting. They tasted rubbery and old and like they had been sitting out all day and then were warmed up in a microwave.  I took two bites and sent them back and was done. I've never sent food back in my life but there was just no way I was willing to pay 14 bucks for what they served me.  They took the ribs off our tab but still charged me for the salad. I tasted those nasty ribs in my mouth all night! Yuck!  I know that when you pick Applebee's to eat at you shouldn't expect a 5 star meal, but for what they charge the food should at least be edible.

The woman who was waiting on us was completely ditzy and had forgotten everything that we had requested at our table. The food we had received was wrong, the food was gummy, and just unappetizing.

Alex was our server and he rock. The food got to us so fast and was delish... The Dads said the fish tasted fresh and was large whole fillets. Light and not grease at all. Unusual for a chain restaurant I think. Large cut fries and cold coleslaw where the sides. My hamber was cooked perfect and had a lots of blue cheese and bacon. No scrimping here. Our sodas where refilled with out asking. I treated my Dad to desert and surprised him with the apple crisp that served with vanilla ice cream. It came out sizzling on a platter. It soooo Good. It was so large we all eat some. We have been back twice now and each time the food was great. My husband I have been back twice. We ordered the same thing each time.

Jennai P.,"Grass Valley, CA",68,25,2,1.0,4/5/2014,"We just returned from a terrible dining experience. My husband and I decided to go to Applebees for dinner. We were seated quickly as it wasn't particularly busy. We got out drinks in a timely manner, but it took the waitress about 15-20 minutes to come take our order. We ordered a bacon burger with fries, the chicken penne sun dried tomato pasta and for an appetizer we ordered the spinach dip. It took about 15 minutes for the spinach dip to arrive. When we got it, it was warm, and the chips were stale. We didn't bother complaining as we were very hungry so we just dealt with it. Unfortunately, we couldn't do the same with out dinner. My chicken penne pasta arrived cold, with cold diced tomatoes on it (no sun dried tomatoes to be seen) and the pasta was so overdone it was like paste. The burger was ok, but the fries looked like they had been reheated already.  I'm not generally a ""send it back"" kind of person, but this was not edible food. Bu the time I finally got the waitress' attention, my husband was nearly finished with his burger. I gave the waitress the food and opted not to order anything else as I didn't want to wait another 30 minutes, nor did I want to sit and eat by myself. The waitress acted like she was doing us a huge favor by taking my meal off of the bill. Mind you, I took 2 bites and gave my husband a bite to make sure it wasn't just me being picky. The table next to us had ordered the same drink, and I am not exaggerating, SIX times and had never received a single one. The place was only half full, and there was only one person sitting at the bar. There is no excuse for this poor of service. They were not short staffed as servers were tripping over each other there were so many. I feel like Applebees should have at least comped us our appetizer as the chips were stale, and I left without dinner.

The food was really very good.  My steak was cooked perfectly and the mushrooms were sauteed the way I like.  However, there were way too many greasy onions and my garlic potatoes didn't have any garlic in them.   Honestly, I think the prices for what you get are ridiculously overdone.  An $80 bill for four dinners?... wait...

Eric H.,"Applegate, CA",20,33,6,2.0,10/6/2017,"Applebee's has been in this location in Auburn for many years.  I have lived near Auburn for even longer.  Sometimes you drive by a place day after day and don't even give it a second thought.  As time passes your forget the reasons that you don't go there.  My wife wanted to pick up dinner on her way home from Grass Valley and we decided to give it another try, it had been at least two years since our last visit. This time I would call in an order and she would pick it up as it was late in the evening, about 8:40.  She told me what she wanted on the phone and I went to my computer to look at the menu.  The web site told me that I could order on-line and get $5.00 off my first on-line order using a code that they provided.  I proceeded to the menu ordering system and placed an order for fish & chips, a burger with a baked potato and an order of nachos. At the end of the ""fill your cart"" portion I entered all of the pertinent personal information, email address, name, etc.  There was a field for the coupon code.  It wouldn't take the code that was advertised on the previous page.  I tried it twice, I decided to complete my order anyway.  I entered all of my credit card information and completed the order.   I included a $5.00 tip as I figured some server was going to have to assemble the order with utensils etc.  It was about 8:45 PM.  The site told me that our order would be ready at 8:58 PM.    My wife arrived there at 9:00 and they told her that it wasn't ready yet.  She waited and waited, she texted me and waited some more.  At about 20 minutes after they finally brought her the food.  They told her that they did not have any potatoes to make baked potatoes, they substituted mashed and gravy instead.  She was already aggravated at this point as she had waited too long.   The gravy was already coating the inside of the bag so they had to re-bag the food and place the gravy container inside another container to prevent spillage. 8 minutes later, she is home with the food.  I was not happy with mashed potatoes.  How does a restaurant run out of potatoes to bake?  Maybe poor management of the ordering process.  It's not like they are items that spoil in a day or two.  The burger was very good, the nachos were so-so. My wife started on her Fish & Chips and they were not even warm.  We surmised that they probably were prepared first and sat while the rest of the order was cooked.  She was extremely disappointed and had to microwave the fish to warm it up. Now it all comes back to me why we drive past that Applebee's as if it doesn't exist!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-17
Sirrena S.,"Sacramento, CA",361,7,2,1.0,12/31/2017,"Service slow, unable to fill our order and still charged us full price??? Only a half rack .. and sides not what we ordered ... The pay at your table service was down ..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-17
courtney m.,"Auburn, CA",0,16,5,3.0,8/29/2016,"Went for a family dinner last night. The menu has changed a lot since the last time I visited but the food was great!! And very adequately priced. Would come again for the food. The only downfall I see with this place is that it seemed like it's ran by a handful of inexperienced young kids. The service at the front door was super awkward and we weren't greeted. I loved the server we had as we ordered our drinks. But then our new server popped in to take over. While she was pleasant, she was so annoying which is why I won't state her name. Overly salesy, overly rehearsed words, asked my boyfriend if he wants a refill while taking care the table next to us which I thought was unprofessional. I don't want to be included with another parties dining experience. We are all seperate. I'll be back for the food and drinks!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-17
JEN M.,"Rocklin, CA",119,277,64,4.0,6/28/2016,"Max was our server, he was great! Grilled chicken was juicy and yummy. Thai shrimp salad had good flavor and tasted fresh.

Joanna L.,"Newcastle, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/24/2017,"We got here around 8pm.  We were served quickly and the food was average, which is par for Applebee's.  There is a little device on the table that let's you order/pay/call for the server.  We used it to pay, but I wanted to take my food home so I selected the button to call for the server.  I guess they figured that because we had paid that they didn't need to help us  we sat at the table for 15 minutes with the red light flashing calling for service and we're ignored by our server who served the people beside us then left.  Not only that but we were ignored by the other servers, too.  I won't be coming back.  This place has a poor Yelp score for a reason.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-17
Rana S.,"Sacramento, CA",9,41,2,5.0,5/15/2017,"I came here with my mom and brother because we wanted to try their 2 for $20 promotion. The restaurant is clean and well attended - we were were seated right away because it wasn't too busy. We started with the spinach and artichoke appetizer (which was quite good), I got the Three Cheese Cavatappi, my brother got the Spinach and artichoke Cavatappi and my mom got the half rack and chicken breast grill combo. Mom and brother were happy with their meals but I would say for mine it wasn't very saucy (it was like eating just macaroni), I couldn't tell there were three cheeses and it lacked flavor so I added some black pepper and that made it a bit better. I like spicy foods though and would have loved some hot red pepper (or something!) to give it a zing of flavor. Next time I'll try the ribs....mom's was good! But the food is fine and as expected for a chain like this...our server Jason B really made the night great by being so attentive and taking care of us so well. I would come back to this location for him next time we drive through Auburn, he was so nice! Although come to think of it, all of the servers seemed to be professional and attentive to their customers so maybe they're all worth coming back for!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-17

Judy A.,"Colfax, CA",3,51,,4.0,4/1/2016,"Had a late lunch today and I have to say Kelsey is a wonderful server and deserves major kudos for her patience, her professionalism, manners and sense of humor. Applebee's is a decent place to meet for lunch, the Wonton Tacos are very good, a lite meal if you wish but we had them as an appetizer. If your in the mood for adult libations try their Perfect Patron Margarita, but be prepared to sit a while if your a light weight like me!  Lol",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-17

Robert P.,"Auburn, CA",0,16,4,1.0,3/23/2017,"So used to love this place but it's def gone downhill. Wife and I just ordered two burgers and when I picked mine up grease just dropped and dropped out of it and left a puddle about 6"" around on my plate. My wife took a bite of hers and all she could taste was the grease on a BBQ burbon burger. We won't be going back. The manager came out and did t charge us for the meal or the meal my daughter had and even though you could tell she felt bad and gave us a free mazzarello stick plate next time we won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-17

One night after a long day from we me and my husband decide to go have dinner there everyone was super nice we ordered and everything, I got my food wonton tacos I was enjoying them as I'm half way through my taco and I start pulling it out of my mouth, I told my husband my hair doesn't easily fall off and you know that. He got one waitress to help me out who sent another waitress who took my food and apologized. She came back with a new plate of tacos and she said "" sometimes it helps to know but it was your hair you may feel less grossed about the situation me and the supervisor took a look at it and it looks like your hair.""  Still bringing me the hair that I put in the plate ,First of all how could you make an accusation against your customer couldn't we be more professional and just take care of the problem period and not make accusations and make your customer uncomfortable.

James B.,"Roseville, CA",42,75,89,3.0,1/31/2016,Alright experience. Nothing special. Had the grilled chicken and rice. Tastes good. Too much seasoning on the chicken tenders though.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-17
Professional T.,"La Mirada, CA",1,11,3,3.0,3/22/2016,"Dinner. Washed up in the restroom. They were clean.  Ordered a Caesar salad, and the bourbon street steak done medium and a dirty martini.  The Caesar salad had fresh cold romaine. The dressing was watery and did not stick to the lettuce. It should have been creamy. The martini was good.  The steak arrived sizzling hot. It was expected to be dripping with butter as it was prepared on a skillet. The temperature was perfect. The seasoning was too salty. It was supposed to be a Cajun seasoning. No heat, but salty. Expected paprika and some red pepper. Never tasted that.  Service was good.  Applebee's is one of those chains that you can find almost anywhere and they will fill you up without regard to health. There are a few items on the menu that have 600 calories. Better off going to an outback or Texas road house for a steak. But for comfort food that is a chain, this place is average. Not horrible but not extravagant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-17
