Spencer V.,"Thomson, GA",45,246,1304,5.0,10/20/2017,"The place is still incredible the many times I came here. My mom and I stopped here last Tuesday for some lunch and its as good as it gets. The appetizers were splendid, the  Marguerites  were amazing and the service was excellent. Will definitely come here again soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-augusta-9
Lynn B.,"Hilton Head Island, SC",18,1,,1.0,12/21/2017,"We had a party of 7 for our Holiday  party. We arrived shortly after 1 pm and got our food at 2:40. We got our checks at 3:25 pm.  The drinks were watered down or flat, and the majority of the orders were incorrect.  We won't come back here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-augusta-9
Bre J.,"Atlanta, GA",23,130,,1.0,9/11/2017,"The worst dinning experience thus far this year. Bartender spoke with the ""regulars"" the whole time I was there, never came by to ask how the meal was. The food was watered down box Marconi and cheese with some over fried tasteless shrimp. I have no idea what I was thinking stopping here for dinner. Never ever and I mean never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-augusta-9
Erin M.,"Atlanta, GA",81,2,,1.0,11/12/2017,"Worst service I've ever had here. First, we waited 5-10 minutes for the hostess to even show up at the hostess stand (with four groups waiting for a table). Then, we were chastised by the waitress in front of other guests for offering to help set up high chairs (as we tried to help hurry things along). Then, no one greeted us or even paid us any attention. After we waited for over ten minutes at a table for our server, we left. We will NOT be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-augusta-9
Julie M.,"Augusta, GA",12,115,55,1.0,8/25/2017,"Nope! Service is awful, the food isn't good. Overall it's the worst experience I've had a a chain restaurant (usually chain will at least have consistent food, they do not). The atmosphere is extreamly loud and I almost felt unwelcomed here. I won't be back and would not suggest a visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-augusta-9
Nicole M.,"San Diego, CA",177,241,639,1.0,6/13/2016,"NO NO NO NO NO. Service is terrible, food is even worse. Our waitress was awesome, though - super friendly and helpful, her name was Courtnee. However, the trainer she had, Sabrina.... Not a fan, and really wouldn't want to be served by her again or have to deal with her again at this or any other establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-augusta-9
Greg S.,"Ellenwood, GA",77,1,,1.0,11/5/2017,"Horrible, for my 1st time. Seat at the bar.. no greeting , no acknowledgment . It took like 10mins for the bartender girl to even say anything to me.. and when she finally did she had a attitude like I did something wrong.. I think it will be my 1st and last time coming to this Applebee's ..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-augusta-9
Alissa R.,"Martinez, GA",7,3,8,1.0,7/1/2017,"Okay trying to enjoy a late lunch, my chicken was okay at best the rice was hard and dry the water  was good that's the best I can offer",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-augusta-9
Alexandrea T.,"Hephzibah, GA",118,10,7,4.0,2/25/2017,"Food is very yummy I got the classic combo app , my boyfriend got a steak it was very good but services wise on night they know they get busy example SATURDAY NIGHT I think they need to hire or schedule more staff there was staff running around like a mad dog !! With almost every table filled ! If you don't have patience I wouldn't suggest",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-augusta-9
Ðëvïlîshlÿ Ð.,"Fort Polk, LA",4,26,19,2.0,6/12/2015,"Lazy people here, waitress at bar texting and talking on phone, other servers keep taking the food to the wrong table. What is wrong with these people, there is no manager in site. Good Lord it's a feeak ahow here. I will say the food is not bad if u get rhe right food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-augusta-9
Sandra F.,"Cincinnati, OH",366,1347,4648,3.0,3/31/2013,"There are only a few chain restaurants I go to.  My parents had a gift certificate and wanted food picked up at curbside.  I ordered on the phone and picked up our meals.  They were ready in 20 minutes which was quick.  I got the Napa Chicken & Porobellos.  Not the best tasting, but it was in the healthy section which was only 550 calories.  There were not alot of options in the area to eat healthy and Applebees had a decent section.  I would not return again, but my parents seem to love this place alot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-augusta-9
Melissa T.,"Augusta, GA",10,3,,3.0,6/29/2016,Cool place to hang out.  Pissed out because they took the Fried Green Beans off the menu.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-augusta-9
Kimberly E.,"Hephzibah, GA",88,1,,4.0,5/21/2016,Our server was extremely nice. I left behind $40 that slipped out of my pocket. I called about 30 minutes later and the server held onto it for me. So impressed by her honesty.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-augusta-9
Rebecca V.,"Augusta, GA",2,13,5,4.0,2/17/2015,Their new pub pretzels are good. My  kids really enjoy their burgers. I enjou the new chilli bbq sauce. My husband is a bourbon steak lover. Got the ribs and they were all ate. We asked for hot fresh fries and they delivered.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-augusta-9
Denise Z.,"Augusta, GA",0,3,,1.0,8/15/2016,"The place was almost empty, and several tables and booths were available. Told us there was going to be a 10 minute wait. Left out of there, went somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-augusta-9
Elena J.,"Savannah, GA",5,20,,1.0,8/23/2015,"The food is sub par and the service is worse.  We sent back appetizer and entree, no replacements because we were too afraid of more bad food.  The fish and chips tasted okay but the grease was out of this world.  Servers obviously did not want to be there, attitudes were indicative of poor management.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-augusta-9
Kimberly S.,"Harbor City, CA",24,10,3,1.0,5/26/2014,Wow...I can't believe how little my husband is getting for a $13.00 meal. This looks like $5.00.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-augusta-9
Derrick T.,"Jonesboro, GA",69,2,1,1.0,5/20/2015,Worst service of any Applebee's I have ever been to. The management does not care that it takes more than an hour to be served a hamburger and when it arrived it was still wrong. Do not come here!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-augusta-9
Kandis A.,"Augusta, GA",510,506,2921,3.0,12/19/2014,I've been to this location a few times. I don't prefer it because the people that normally come here are a little rowdy and boisterous. So I choose to go to other locations in town. All the times I have been here the service was good. I can't complain about that. The food was actually good as well. The wait is a little long here as well. I guess this location is popular among the South Augusta crowd because it's always like a 30 minute wait. I just try my luck at the other Applebee's in the area.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-augusta-9
Paul F.,"North Augusta, SC",33,362,84,2.0,2/16/2015,A little wait to get our seats which was no problem.  Got our seats and there was just no one to come and take our order.  Must have been a good 15 minutes before someone came to take our order.  The food was good but not for the value.  Probably wont go back here based on the service and value for money.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-augusta-9
Angela W.,"Augusta, GA",0,1,,3.0,7/22/2014,"I took my sister to lunch for her birthday ,the food good ,but they just had to much sauce on the ribs ,and they are a little to sweet.i would go back there I just will not orders that meal again .and they didn't give us any rolls.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-augusta-9?start=20
Mario S.,"Chula Vista, CA",63,33,2,1.0,6/12/2013,Service sucked! I seen a cook come up front with an apron on and talked at the greeters desk. 3 thumbs down,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-augusta-9?start=20
Jonathan S.,"Hephzibah, GA",0,6,,2.0,9/18/2013,"The only reason I'm not rating this as one star is that I'm hoping my last experience was a fluke.  I've been going here for years, but hadn't been back in about 2 years.  Sadly, it seems to have gone downhill.  My medium rare steak came out purple on the inside... basically raw meat.  It took forever for them to get it back to me (which is nuts since I've worked at several Applebee's and know they just throw these into the microwave to brown them further if they're sent back).  When it came time to leave, we needed 4 checks, but this girl couldn't seem to get anything right on separate checks.  After waiting an additional 20 minutes for her to try to run our cards, I finally found a manager who explained that the girl was new and on the floor for her first day.  Really?  You schedule a new girl, who's never waited on a table on her own, on the Sunday lunch rush for her first shift?  Wow.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-augusta-9?start=20
