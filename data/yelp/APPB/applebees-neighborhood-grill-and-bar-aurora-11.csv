M S.,"Commerce City, CO",3,38,13,1.0,6/21/2016,"I have been going to this location for over a year and the service has been sub par but this last time I went I was so disappointed! The server came out and specifically asked if we would want something to drink such as a lemonade, soda or water. We ordered 2 lemonade sand an iced tea. I noticed the advertisement on the table that said if they don't offer a perfect margarita that it's free. I mentioned this to the server and he swore up and down that he offered one. The other two people at the table with me never heard him offer either... He then walked away from our table without ever taking our order. He went to the bar and started talking to some other servers. We then waved him over (had been there 15 minutes at this point and hadn't ordered). He took our order and when our order came out my order was wrong... I ordered my steak medium and it was clearly burnt to a crisp. The server didn't come back so I just ate the sides and a piece of the steak. When the server came to take our plates, I let him know the steak wasn't good at all and he said ""ok"". No apology, just ""ok"". I then got the little table pay station and noticed it wasn't our bill so I let another waiter know and he found the correct one. I pulled up the pay screen and my meal had been compd so I paid... Never even saw our server again. I am so disappointed as we love eating at Applebee's but this location has been awful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-aurora-11?start=20
Kaytie J.,"Wilmington, NC",27,33,2,2.0,8/17/2015,"Received a call from manager after writing a letter to the corporate office.  He did apologize for the terrible service, told me that the waitress would be spoken to about the complaint made and sent a gift certificate to ""try and get us back in the restaurant"".  I probably won't go, but I'll give the gift certificate to a friend.  I was appreciative that he called to apologize, but it doesn't really detract from the way we felt/were treated while in the restaurant the night before.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-aurora-11?start=20
Demi B.,"Denver, CO",0,4,,5.0,6/11/2016,"Great food great drinks and even greater service! Will definitely be returning. Not extremely busy either so it is a nice place to chill and have drinks. The food was so on point! The atmosphere is new and clean! Can't wait for next time, thank you Applebees! You blew our minds. Brian had awesome service that will keep us coming back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-aurora-11?start=20
Amber U.,"Denver, CO",85,5,,1.0,5/18/2016,"Wish I could give a negative star, but a one will do. Walked out today after our lunch order hit a 40 minute waiting time. Not once were we told why our two hamburger meals were taking so long and we were sitting there listening to other guests tell the waiter their food order was wrong. Wasted almost an hour here with empty stomachs and a grouchy kiddo who is sad he didn't get his lunch he ordered. Called GM and he wasn't helpful either. Take the extra 10 minutes to drive to chilis or TGIFridays up the street.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-aurora-11?start=20
Amber L.,"Aurora, CO",4,10,,4.0,2/22/2015,"Went to this location for the first time last week. Very attentive staff, surprisingly delicious appetizers and clean, Aurora themed decorations. Only bad thing is the ridiculously overpriced drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-aurora-11?start=20
Tracy T.,"Denver, CO",73,1,,2.0,10/16/2015,"I usually only look up reviews. I try to stay away from making them. I work for a dealership in service and understand how frustrating it can be to see reviews from people who are just ridiculous and self righteous. Or they have never really given a place a chance. I gave this place two chances. First time they completely forgot a half rack of ribs. No problem.  Called to see what could be done. They said it would be refunded. OK, awesome. It never made it back to the credit card. OK whatever, the food is really good. Ordered again tonight and the salad was literally lettuce and cheese. No bacon,  cucumbers, nothing. Also,  my girlfriend and I's favorite dessert of all time,  the Blondie,  did not come with the special sauce. THAT IS WHAT MAKES THE BLONDIE!!!! come on guys. I know it's Friday,  but that has to be standard to include. We will probably be back, but you better believe the order will be triple checked before we leave. Good thing the food is delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-aurora-11?start=20
Jessica A.,"Aurora, CO",0,6,,1.0,4/19/2015,"Another bad experience. Sunday afternoon, 3pm, 9 months pregnant and all I want is soup and salad. I chose two items from the menu and was told I couldn't have a soup and salad combo bc it was the weekend. After confirming with her manager, I ended up purchasing the two items separately and ultimately not getting the salad I wanted bc they don't offer the combo or half sized salads. My husband asked for a strawberry limeade and received a strawberry lemonade. When he got his refill she said they made it wrong the first time and proceeded to give him a cherry limeade. This may not seem like a big deal but lemonade with fruit vs sprite with grenadine is a big difference. She didn't even ask him which he'd prefer. He would've liked to have had the same beverage for the whole meal and not have it changed hallway thru. The store manager was clearly seen asking all the other tables around us how their meal was and making small talk but he completely avoided our table. Knowing that we had a issue with the menu to begin with I would've expected him to at least stop by and see how we were doing but he didn't. He avoided us like the plague. Our booth had greasy finger prints all over the walls and our hostess was neither in a rush to seat us or thank us for dining when we left. Apparently her conversation with another employee was too important to be disrupted with a simple, hello or thank you and good bye. We will not return to say the least.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-aurora-11?start=20
Sandra H.,"Denver, CO",1,16,,1.0,12/18/2015,"Well, I was thrilled when I saw an Applebee's being built here months ago, it used to be a wonderful chain restaurant, Hubby and I became regulars initially because its close to home and had decent food, with a good atmosphere.  Went there recently, and noticed that the serving size of the food was dramatically reduced, my piece of Salmon was very small, but still tasty.  I ordered a half slab of ribs to take home (as I usually do) I was dissapointed when I warmed them up, for $13.99 I had the smallest half slab of ribs I ever seen, I only had 4 bones, this must have been from a Pygmy Pig!  Not worth the cost, I felt ripped off and wished I would have looked at this before I left the restaurant, but I trusted that they would be honest with their portions instead of giving me a fourth of a portion instead of half.  You lost another regular customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-aurora-11?start=20
P M.,"Aurora, CO",0,29,,2.0,5/2/2015,"Granted, it's been quite some time since I've been to an Applebee's, but I was quite disappointed.  $20+ bucks for a sandwich with cold fries and a salad?  Yikes!  Nothing special about this place and they have changed the menu so much that I hardly recognized them as an Applebee's.  Whatever you do, don't ""play"" with the electronic gadget on the table because it will add another buck to your bill!  I'm sorry, but if you want me to use an electronic gadget to order my food, I'm not also going to pay you for that ""privilege""!  It was really cold inside the night we went, but the wait person was cold, too, and she was able to get someone to cut the air a bit.  Sorry, we won't be back anytime soon.  There are too many other places in the area that offer more value for the money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-aurora-11?start=20
Holly S.,"Denver, CO",0,11,11,3.0,8/21/2017,"Hit or miss on service at this location. I've had some pretty awesome servers and some that are not very attentive. I'd say it's a 50/50 shot as to getting someone who will put in a little more effort than others. I have found that  you're gonna be here awhile if u stop in so I wouldn't recommend this place if you're hoping to get in and out kinda quickly.  My main reason it only rates at a three.   On the bright side the majority of time the food is just what u would expect from an Applebee's and not bad. I can only remember being disappointed once by a salad that was seasonal.  I happen to see an special for burgers on Monday nights and tried that this visit. The burger was really , really good. I thought it might leave a lot to be desired since it was so cheap but happy to report I loved the burger. Had dinner for two and drink special w tip for under 30 bucks ! Always a thumbs up!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-aurora-11
Shaurica C.,"Denver, CO",834,421,299,4.0,11/24/2017,"Nice, quiet Applebee's to have a meal at. The staff is okay, could be a little more attentive. The food is on par with Applebee's standards, if that means anything, lol. Parking situation could be better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-aurora-11
Jason F.,"Aurora, CO",0,2,1,2.0,10/27/2017,Ordered the 4 cheese mac and cheese with honey pepper chicken tenders. Lame portion to say the least. What little food i did get was very disappointing!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-aurora-11
Jon W.,"Hays, KS",0,7,,1.0,10/26/2017,Out for a late night bite and decided to drop in and I know they close at midnight so I was like ok will keep it simple. Stood waiting to be seated for 10 minutes and the staff just looked at us and walked away. I made eye contact with every single one of them and nothing. One of the staff was outside the front door smoking and he saw us come in. He comes in and goes hides by the other waitstaff in the far back of the dinning area. I'm severely disappointed in the fact that the staff had no interest in seating us during normal business hours.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-aurora-11
Jeanethe P.,"Norfolk, VA",4,2,1,1.0,11/11/2017,"We are extremely disappointed with the uncomfortable service this location has provided to us. We went to take advantage of the veterans menu that was provided that night, and we waited 15 min in our table. No one ever came over to greet us or take our order. Every single server that was there walked past us, not acknowledging our presence. We even received disgusted looks by some. We called server on the table top server (iPad machine on table) and it was on for a while. When we decided to leave, I approached manager for that night and told him that we were there waiting for past 15 min and all he could say was Sorry. Didn't even offer to get a waiter to us. So we left. We felt like we were discriminated because we were a different race than others. SPECIALLY after the way we were being starred at. We frequently eat at Applebee's but we will NEVER dine at this location. Poor and Horrible service. It wasn't that the restaurant was busy... it really wasn't. We were seated immediately. It was so embarrassing just walking out of a restaurant like that. We are so humiliated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-aurora-11
VBaby O.,"Denver, CO",9,104,3,4.0,9/10/2017,I have avoided Applebees for years. We took our family there today and it had really improved. Kindof impressed lol,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-aurora-11
Laura L.,"Denver, CO",106,104,33,5.0,12/23/2016,Walk in and was greeted with a host who was so nice through the holiday season! Was seated immediately she even told us merry Christmas! The waitress was also very nice she was very attentive and gave us a few minutes to look over the menu. I ordered the steak salad and my bf ordered the shrimp menu. It took a little longer than usual but the place was full; we got our food and it was very delicious! So delicious!!!! Everyone was very nice and super friendly! I don't understand the bad review for this place. I have really enjoyed this place it was awesome!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-aurora-11
Travis B.,"Denver, CO",0,2,,1.0,12/18/2016,"We came to this Applebees to order a quick lunch and a few drinks. The place was almost empty when we arrived, with only 5-6 tables being occupied. It took 5 minutes for a hostess to even acknowledge us, and she seemed put out to have to seat us.  After sitting down, we ordered a few drinks and proceeded to wait 20 minutes before they arrived. The server, Trent, was abrupt and unpleasant at best. When the drinks finally came, we ordered some chips and salsa. We then waited another 25 minutes before I finally asked to speak with the manager. The manager, Steven, came over and apologized for the delay and said he would see about the status of our order. The status? We asked for chips and salsa, this should take 10 seconds to plate and deliver.   The chips were finally delivered as we all sat there with empty glasses, hoping for a refill. Another 20 minutes of not seeing our server anywhere, i asked to speak with the manager once again. Steven carried on with his business, completely ignoring us for the next 10 minutes. After patiently waiting over an hour for one drink and a small plate of chips and salsa, we walked out. Steven and Trent both displayed zero sense of customer service, and I would not recommend this pathetic establishment to anyone. Avoid at all costs!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-aurora-11
Hazel H.,"Denver, CO",30,15,14,2.0,12/18/2016,"Came in today with a party of four our server was very nice i cant remeber his name which is why this is a two star vs. a one. But while waiting for s food we hear from the kitchen a bunch of screaming back and forth. It sounded like someone was upset aboutthere work schudule working 9-5. When we arried it was maybe around 6-630 or so. And it seemed like all ther servers were in the back. After a couple shouts amd doors being slamed you saw the waiters go back to there regular shift. A guy came out to which his name is brent and was talking to the bartener very loud again for us to hear. ""Im not afraid of him"" and saying that what was he gonna do ( im guessing the person who was shouting back there). Made our dining very akward and unconffy won't be coming back here. Seems like staff isn't treated very fair..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-aurora-11
rhonda f.,"Aurora, CO",63,79,3,2.0,12/21/2016,Saddest steak salad I have ever seen.  I wish I had taken a picture of it.  I ordered the southwestern steak salad. What showed up was iceberg lettuce (supposed to be mixed greens) with an ounce of watery meat plopped next to it.  Next to no tortilla strips and maybe 3 pieces of corn.  If I worked in the kitchen there is NO WAY I would let any customer see or eat that.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-aurora-11
Mikey P.,"Aurora, CO",41,128,47,1.0,11/25/2016,To be honest I've never had a good service here and other locations. Riblettes are very dry with too much BBQ sauce.

Mike M.,"Aurora, CO",0,5,,1.0,3/15/2017,"I would give zero stars if that was an option. Absolutely the worst.  Ordered online and the person who took the order didn't bother to tell anyone.  Showed up at the restaurant and was told that they had no To Go order.  My wife called and they offered an excuse but also apologized. Supposedly the person who took the order was too busy. The place was almost empty and there were no To Go orders so it's hard to understand how the staff was ""too busy."" We were told that the person would have to talk to her boss about comping. We decided to skip it given the level of incompetence already displayed.  We will not be back to this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-aurora-11
Peter M.,"Denver, CO",492,747,83,1.0,1/27/2016,"Whoops.  That's what I get for not reading my fellow Yelper's reviews.  It took 50 minutes to get two SALADS after ordering on a Saturday where the restaurant was not very busy.  When they did come out, the portions were smaller than you would expect.  The server was quick to greet and seat us, but then basically disappeared for an hour after we ordered.  Some kitchen dude had to run out our food.

Chelsea D.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,6,2,2.0,8/27/2015,"Usually service is pretty good, food is either a hit or miss but tonight my visit is disappointing all around. Started with me asking for ice water with lemon when I requested more lemon the waiter rudely raised his eye brows and mimicked ""more""? Mind you the cup is big and I only got one. For food I ordered the chicken tenders that came with fries and cole slaw, fries were horrible so stale in taste and the chicken were toddler size! And they forgot my cole slaw.. Stay AWAY from the chicken tenders and don't ask for extra lemon",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-aurora-11
Derek R.,"Aurora, CO",0,8,2,1.0,9/5/2015,Have been here a few times hoping it would get better but today's lunch was the worst. Waiter was pretty good but the food was sub par.
