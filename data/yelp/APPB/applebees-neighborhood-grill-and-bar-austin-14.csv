Marty B.,"Round Rock, TX",34,5,,1.0,10/23/2016,"This place will suck your soul out of you.  Came here for my mom's birthday and we should have gone anywhere else. Sat down at 3:45 and didn't get our food until 4:30. We ordered 3 orders of the boneless wings and the French Onion Soup, as well as an appetizer if Sriracha Shrimp and the Artichoke dip. We never received the appetizers.   As for the wings, tool 45 minutes to get 2 of the orders (my brother and sisters).  Mine never came until I asked the manager about my wings, which came out 10 minutes after everyone else.   I would maybe understand if they were busy, but our waitress has 3 tables, and we're the largest (a 6 top).  We had to ask her three times just to get my mom and SIL glasses of water. Ive been to the Applebee's in Round Rock many times and never had service like this. Seriously, spend the extra 10-15 minutes to drive up to Round Rock and to there. You'll get better service and more than likely be out of there before you'll even get your food here.  I honestly wish we had gone somewhere else at this point at this point. Edit: I will say they did comp part of our order, which was nice. I don't know if it was an off day or if it's always that bad there. I'm glad I've gone to Applebee's before at other locations and had a good experience as today would have turned me off from Applebee's for good if it was my first time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-austin-14?start=20
Rubbie S.,"Manor, TX",59,516,2074,4.0,2/1/2016,I received a gift card for my birthday to go here.  We arrived and were seated right away with no problems. The waitress was very attentive. Our food was great. I ordered rib-lets which were awesome with fries and my cousin ordered steak with vegetables and mashed potatoes. He said that choice was delicious. Very nice portions of food. drinks were definitely never ending or shall I say ever flowing the waitress was on point with our refills.

Irum J.,"Dallas, TX",108,124,38,1.0,5/19/2017,"Just experienced a real poor dining experience!!  We walked in and immediately informed the wait staff we were in a time crunch and to bring all food at once and the bill with Togo boxes. We patiently waited a whole hour!!! We kept asking if there was a problem in the kitchen and got bullshit responses like ""kitchen slow"", ""manager in back helping"", etc. I finally told the waitstaff we couldn't wait anymore and we were leaving. We had our appetizers still on the table and in this frenzy the waiter there out our food! Needless to say the manager brought the food out and placed it Togo bags and got us out quick and shaved off half the bill to clean up this mess. Wish the inexperienced waiter would have been more upfront about our food situation rather than holding us hostage. Now we're going to be pulling up to our remote Texas town tomorrow morning! Pissed because we disclosed we had a long drive ahead of us...we've officially written off all Applebee's....they need to do a better job training their servers- oh and the server didn't refill our drinks!!!!

David L.,"Arlington, TX",51,89,137,1.0,7/14/2015,There is nothing like the consistency of Apple Bee's.  I eat and pay for 40 people a month in Ft. Worth and try to find the same level of service at other locations.  Unfortunately like so many of the locations the lack of service is only as disappointing as the long waits for food.  I keep telling myself to quit trying chains while I travel but I love the Ft. Worth location and was hoping they where AppleBees not an exception. I was wrong and the sorry rotted spinach (picture posted) should help say more than the longest review.

Rylan M.,"Kissimmee, FL",93,4,,1.0,9/20/2016,"Every time we come to this location there is no host at the front door to seat us. After waiting a while the last time, someone finally came to the door to greet us. She had a great personality and sat us near the kitchen in the middle section of the restaurant. We had good hopes for this visit because of her. We waited at the table for 10 minutes before we just got up and left. Nobody had come to introduce themselves or bring us waters or ask if we had been tended to. We pressed the ""call server"" button on the tablet at the table and a girl made eye contact with us from the kitchen, but continued to talk to her coworkers and never came to us. I understand waiting a minute or two if the restaurant is busy, but when there are only two other small parties at a restaurant this size, 10 minutes is beyond unacceptable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-austin-14?start=20
Dan F.,"Austin, TX",3,5,2,4.0,11/12/2015,"Appelbee's has a very generous Veterans' Day discount which earns huge respect from me. They are part of the same corporation as Chili's and Olive Garden, and as a Navy veteran I eat at one of those places each year usually. I've gotten consistently good service each time and this Appelbee's was no exception. I also appreciate the late hours that they're open (until 2am even on Vets Day) because I tend to eat dinner past 10pm. So I got the late night shift staff, and got outstanding service, which is why I'm writing a review of a chain restaurant that probably doesn't need publicity. My server was a slim, tall blonde woman that I'd guess was around 32-38, but I forgot her name. She was super friendly and cheerful despite the late hour, checked on me diligently, and thanked me for my service as a veteran. I tipped what I guessed (since it was free) was 30%, and afterwards wished I'd tipped even more. I ordered the 7oz sirloin steak medium rare and I was impressed how the cooks grilled that right to perfection, just like I wanted, exactly medium rare. The meat was juicy, flavorful, a bit chewy like it should be at medium rare. It was no Roaring Fork ribeye but for the normal price it would be a very good deal. Veggies and mashed potatoes were savory.  Other commenters have noted that the surrounding neighborhood tends to be low income, but with gentrification advancing in Austin at a frantic pace that won't last. This part of town is getting to be one of the last places a working person can buy a house in. This restaurant targets people pulling off the interstate hence the late hours I assume. The lighting was bright all around the restaurant and I felt safe parking here around midnight. Maybe because I always behave on Vets Day like I'm grateful for a free tasty entree, so I'm respectful to the staff, so I got great service, but then I always try to behave that way (you can't complain about bad service if you were a difficult/rude customer). It's the same everywhere, be a decent customer and you get optimal service. If the servers at this location have to endure a lot of cheap tippers then you'd never know it. Raise your staff's wages if the customers' tips trend low, management. Both my maitre d' and waitress were outstanding, steak was grilled just right. For a chain restaurant at midnight I couldn't expect more. I'd give it five stars but there are numerous other places in town that are my favorite steak houses, and I can't grade it as high as them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-austin-14?start=20
C C.,"Austin, TX",0,14,,1.0,3/4/2017,"The one star is simply because the food was fresh, and flavorful.  When we arrived, there wasnt anyone to seat us.  When the young man came to the host stand, all he said was ""come on y'all.""  There was an average number of patrons for 10:00pm, but a lot of dirty tables.  Plenty of staff, but they didn't seem concerned.  Asked to be seated in the bar, where there were very few people, but a lot of dirty tables.  Music blaring like it was a nightclub and one server that wreaked of marijuana.  If you want a ghetto experience, go to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-austin-14?start=20

Badly cooked, had absolutely no flavor.  It was supposed to be medium rare, well it was in spots, medium to well in others and burnt on the edges.  Which meant the cooks had it on a grill whose heat was not evenly distributed and failed to keep a good eye on the bland (more than likely previously flash frozen meat)  As my wife said, we spent 47 dollars on a meal that gave us the same satisfaction as a .50 cent bowl of cereal at home.  BLAH!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-austin-14?start=100

When I walked in, I could see several girls in the kitchen cracking up about something but the floors were dirty, and the phone was ringing off the hook. When one of the girls finally finished her conversation, she rushed over to the phone and was rude to the customer. She had no tact and a horrible attitude. Once she finally got to me, I told her my name and she said to wait by the bar and they'd bring my food out. I waited by the bar, and the manager walked out asking if I ordered online. I answered yes, and he frantically searched for my ticket. My food hadn't even been made yet. Finally, he apologizes and let's me know I can take a seat and my food will be out shortly. In this time period, there was salsa spilled on the floor that no one cleaned up, and they laughed at the person who spilled it. You could hear the manager barking orders to the kitchen staff. When they brought my order out, they asked me to check it. I went through it but was missing a burger that I paid for online. The girl told me they could make me another ticket and I could pay for it there if I wanted to. I let her know I had already paid for it but would pay for it again since I just wanted to leave. I took another seat and the manager came over with my card letting me know they wouldn't be charging me for it.

Last time I went it took 40 minutes for my mozzarella sticks to come out. No discount for the wait (and no they were cold and gross I threw them out and paid for nothing essentially).

So this man is seating is next to the bar and I asked if we could sit farther away from the bar because the loud rap music was not something I want to have blasting in my ear while I'm having dinner. He makes some snide comment which I can't remember now and moves us to a booth across the restaurant. Peaceful. Things got WAY better after that. Our server Shellie was incredibly sweet and attentive. She deserves a raise. Now the food. Yum! We started off with the sriracha shrimp. Pretty damn good. Then we got hot boneless buffalo wings which were spot on as well. My boyfriend ordered some meal that consisted of sweet chicken strips over Mac and cheese with bacon bits. It was a little strange but still tasty. I ordered a fiesta chicken or Santa Fe chicken I don't remember but it was hella good! The cooks were definitely on point.

We waited a few for about 5 more min before my husband went to the hostess to find out who our server was and also to ask if the guy who walked past us was the manager. We were informed that the guy was the general manager. My husband asked to speak to him. The hostess came to our table to ask if we wanted the manager or the server. We asked for the manager...again. We informed her that he walked by without speaking or acknowledging us and she said ""yea...he's like that sometimes."" He came to the table apologizing saying her thought we had been served already, which is no excuse for not, at minimum, saying hello. He continued to apologize. We decided to leave and HE FOLLOWED US TO OUR CAR!!! What kind of crazy person does that?! He was telling us that he wanted to make it right and take care of us if we decided to come again.

The waitress - she kept looking at us like we had 3 noses and 8 eyes, I think this was her first customer service job.  She was OK, but I wanted to go to the other section where the waiter clearly either liked his job or did a fine acting job. The food we ordered: Brew Pub Pretzels + Beer Cheese Dip:  The cheese was already salty - why add so much more to the top of the cheese?  Not really keen on the idea of suffering from a stroke.  We asked her to take it back, and of course the looks we got.... When she brought it back, it was clear they just ""tried"" to scrape the excess salt mix off the top - well they took half the cheese with it. Salsa Verde Beef Nachos: I asked for extra queso, which I did not get. Another waiter delivered our food and asked if I needed anything else so I mentioned I did not get the extra queso and he offered to bring me a side of it - awesome - until we were getting our check and he still never showed up with the side of queso. The nachos were ok. Clubhouse Grille: Fortunately my husband had no real complaints with this dish - he did enjoy it. Drinks: Dollar margaritas!  So first, when ordering a margarita, usually you are asked with or without salt. No such thing happened so we asked for salt to be sure to get it.  When we got our second round - no salt!

Jon P.,"Austin, TX",9,10,,1.0,5/27/2013,"Applebees, America's worst restaurant. Over the past year I have eaten at Applebees on 5 occasions and had one good experience. I thought for sure it was just the location, but now just a firm believer it is Applebees in general. This is a novel, but could go down as one of my worst restaurant experiences ever.  My friend and I get sat and our server is wonderful to begin with and provides exceptional service. The restaurant is dead with one big table of 15 or so people and one other table in the whole restaurant.  Our waitress brings out our steaks and disappears and I mean disappears, no where to be found. Anyhow, we aren't at a fancy steakhouse, so obviously she isn't trained to say ""can you cut in the center of that steak and maked sure it is cooked as you ordered.""    I ordered medium rare and she ordered medium. Well, her steak is rare and her mashed potatoes are cold. We wait for five minutes for our waitress and she is nowhere to be found. Matter of fact, not a soul around until I go to the bar and the bartender comes over to the other side of the restaurant and helps us out. Asked how she ordered her steak and said ""wow, that is RARE, far from medium, we will get you a new plate out shortly"".  Ten minutes go by and a steak is brought out with two helpings of potatoes. Well, the steak is about 1/3 the size of the steak she had ordered and there were blood droppings all over the plate. It looked disgusting, then the steak had A-1 on it and she didn't order A-1.  We ask for the manager and he says ""can I get you a new steak"" disgusted, my lady friend says ""no, I lost my appetite with this experience."" Manager says how can I make this right. I inform him we had a free meal here because our last experience was so miserable and would like to use it for this meal as we won't be back."".  15 minutes go by and our waitress who hasn't been seen since she dropped off the original steaks is still MIA. I ask the manager ""Can we get our tab so we can go as it has been 15 minutes since we asked for our tab.""   He brings back the tab and took $8 off of it and said 'have a nice day"". I asked him flat out, excuse me, has our waitress been phased as she started out so amazing but we have not seen her once since she dropped off our food."" He says ""I don't know."" and walks off.  1. You are the manager of a restaurant and you don't know where she is?  2. Make something up, give me something, just don't walk away.  Sorry if this seems petty, but it was so gross. Wish I could articulate in words how gross her plate looked with a quarter size steak, blood droppings on the plate and A-1 on the steak when she never put A-1 on it. Batting 200 as a restaurant is not the way to run an operation.

Tani B.,"Austin, TX",34,65,1,4.0,10/20/2010,"I can usually take it or leave it when it comes to Applebee's.  I do love their Perfect Margaritas, but I didn't order that this time.  The Tequila Lime Chicken has been very hit or miss (mostly miss!) the last several times I've gotten it, so I don't order it any more. We went for dinner on Sunday evening, and none of the four of us were in a particularly good mood.  That might have influenced our server - service was particularly lackluster on this evening.  We had to ask for my water to be brought to the table many minutes after everybody else got their drinks and the food order had been taken. But the salad I had.  Wow, it was GOOD!  I ordered the spinach salad with grilled shrimp, bacon bits and hot bacon dressing.  Now perhaps I'm just not ready to admit that bacon makes everything better, but damn, that was one delicious salad!  I think I've found a new favorite! I'm still ticked that Applebee's took the fried pickles off the menu, but between this salad and those Perfect Margaritas, I think I can find room to forgive them that particular indiscretion.  Four stars ALL for the BACON!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-austin-14?start=80

( although they do make some seriously good margarita's here.) However, for all you dieters out there, one restaurant has recognized this and actually made an effort to cater to your diet needs. No more wilted lettuce while everyone else is having steak! Applebee's has partnered with Weight Watchers to bring several actually decent meals to the table, all with relatively low points values. And for once a restaurant is up front with the amount of fat/calories/points these foods contain.  From chicken sandwich's,  onion soup and steak and shrimp skewers, these are not your grandma's diet creations.

Jessica D.,"Warrenville, IL",27,19,,1.0,11/3/2016,"If I could give this zero stars I would. Granted, an Applebee's on its own is not expected to be some sort of fine dining experience, but I don't think capable service is out of the question. We walk in and get sat pretty quickly. Then we wait and wait. Finally a server comes by and grabs our drink order. Then another server proceeds to try to get our drink order again. No big deal, but in the time it took the original server to actually get the drinks, the other server came by and did the same thing again. They were not that busy, maybe 6 tables between 2 servers. We ordered a couple appetizers and when they arrived, it was very clear that the boneless wings had been sitting in the window for awhile. Considering how long it took to get them, we just ate what we had. I ordered a Chicken Fajita Roll-Up which has been a staple in their menu forever. Trust me, I worked at an Applebee's for almost 3 years in the early 2000s, so I know this is true. I get my food and there is an absolutely ridiculous amount of mexi-ranch dressing inside the  wrap. I finally flag down the server and point out that every time I have ordered this before, the sauce was on the side and meant for dipping. She tells me that she has only been there for 2 weeks and she would do something to get it fixed. Fair enough. After another 15 minutes, she come back with another one prepared correctly. She then proceeds to tell me that the cook told her that he knew it was wrong when he made it, but had hoped no one would notice. What?!? Unfortunately, the replacement was pretty obviously quickly thrown together and the tortilla was extremely soggy since they had not put it under the broiler (side note - that is how they did it when I worked there, I cannot vouch for whether or not the preparation has changed since then). I took one bite and decided I was done. We ask the server for the check and she doesn't even question why there is only one bite taken and a napkin thrown on the plate. We pay and get the hell out.  After spending over an hour there, I still left pretty hungry.

Sam G.,"Austin, TX",8,67,8,1.0,10/23/2015,"Oh boy. I worked here, and it deserves the low rating. Let me explain why and how. This is an Applebee's in a particularly ghetto location - about 90% of the people who come here on a regular basis are terrible people and even worse tippers. Combine the two, and you have a waitstaff that is angry about getting treated horribly by demanding customers and hilariously underpaid. It is incredibly disheartening to treat people well and then be tipped a dollar on $40 because they're inherently cheap people. This happens enough, and people start quitting. I've seen waiters have food thrown at them, I've seen waiters have 2 tables on a lunch shift, get stiffed on both, and leave the restaurant owing money due to tip-out requirements. I've also seen waiters literally fight each other in the restaurant, I've seen a gun flashed while working here, and I've seen literal pimps come in with their... Employees. It is a terrible, hostile environment. Eventually, enough people quit that management has a hard time keeping up with hiring, so you have a revolving door of waiters who are semi-trained, not the best crop you can find, and who are equal parts anger and stupidity rolled into one. So you have angry, shitty waiters waiting on angry, shitty people all day. If you are one of the normal people coming in, you'll either get the best service of your life because that waiter is so desperate for normalcy that they treat you like royalty, or you get shitty service that's based on how awful their day has been. Believe me, we can spot a decent customer from a mile away. We can see and smell a bad customer from even farther. The food is your typical Applebee's microwaveable TV dinner. The cooks are trying, but they don't really have a lot of leeway with how they cook things. Sorry, if you expect better, don't go to Applebee's.  The decor is a combination of late 90s and downtrodden urban decay.  The drinks aren't weak because the bartender is stiffing you. The drinks are weak because you ordered a $2 margarita with bottom shelf liquor which is basically watered down rubbing alcohol with food coloring.  If you are a decent person, stay away from here. If you're a thuggin ahole who wants to show off to your hoe but can't afford the tip, don't worry, you'll fit right in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-austin-14?start=40
