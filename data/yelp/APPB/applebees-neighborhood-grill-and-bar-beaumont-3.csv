Leslie N.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,17,,3.0,12/1/2016,"Applebee's is a great place to meet friends.  The atmosphere is nice, and the staff is very accommodating.  They have a wide variety of dishes even if the menu pricing is difficult to understand.  The food quality is spotty.  Sometimes it's so delicious, and other times it is less than average.  The same dish can be so different from customer to customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-beaumont-3?start=40

Donna G.,"Beaumont, CA",21,44,85,5.0,9/26/2016,"Me and my son and my husband came in here on Sunday 9/25/2016 at 3:30 pm - 5:00 pm ,it wasn't that packed at all . It was clean inside and as we walked in we got greeted by a young guy he was very pleasant very polite ,he walked us to our booth to sit down at ,our waiter was very pleasant and very polite she answered all of our questioned that we asked. I ordered a chicken / shrimp plate but it had cajun seasoning on it and I asked my waiter if I could get my plate without the cajun seasoning ,so right away she got the manager and the manager took charge of the change on my order which was a good thing ,the waiter did a good thing by getting the manager and they both were very polite to accomidate me on making my order the correct way ,it's cause I can't eat nothing spicey at all . When I got my plate it was done  right and it was very good and I also had a peach tea quencher which is the bomb . My husband also had the chicken / shrimp plate but he likes the cajun seasoning and he loved his plate as well as I did mine too . My son ordered a grilled chicken macaroni and cheese dish off of the children's big appetite menu with garlic mashed potatoes and they were the bomb,he was very happy with his meal also ,The atmosphere in here in this restaurant is very good ,I liked it alot in here and everyone had a very pleasant very polite personality .

Lesley S.,"San Antonio, TX",940,1200,1290,5.0,11/15/2014,"I've been to this location multiple times and always had great service. After reading several reviews in the last month that had bad service, I have realized I must be the luckiest person in Beaumont to always get great service. We came in even on Veteran's Day which most people know is usually the worst day of the year to go to Applebee's or any other restaurant that offers free meals to Veterans. We were seated within ten minutes, never ran out of drinks, always greeted with a smile, thanked for our service, our food was cooked perfect, and I even seen one of the managers help a Veteran that walked with a cane on to a bar stool so that he may be seated in a timely manner. She told him how much she appreciated his service. I think this is a great Applebees.

Joseph S.,"Loma Linda, CA",0,14,,2.0,8/27/2016,I am looking at the last review and laughing.  The steaks were so chewy I had to spit half of it out.  There is much better steak at the Grand Oak nearby.  This meal was way overpriced for what it was.  They do not cater to kids.  The kids meals were overpriced and no refills on drinks and no desserts.  Remember with happy kids parents write better reviews.  Will not go again for a very long time.  I understand why it was not crowded on a Saturday.  Mediocre service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-beaumont-3?start=40

She didn't smile at all and seemed to look down on us. Luckily, she was not our server. Our server was Kathleen who was much better than the first lady. The food was ok.

Danielle H.,"PORTER RANCH, CA",130,164,10,3.0,10/15/2014,"This is definitely the best Applebee's I have been to. Kathleen was our waitress and she was exemplary. In fact, she appeared to be the only person actually working while everybody else was hiding in the kitchen. I ordered the nachos and they were very tasty. They use a queso blanco and chili with beans instead of shredded cheddar and steak. Delicious! My only grievance is entering the parking lot.

Not just because now everyone knows me by my name, or because all my friends come here after work, but also because the food is good. I love the buffalo sauce, I think their wings (boneless) are much better than Wingstop or Buffalo Wild Wings. Salads are always fresh crisp lettuce and veggies. They have a decent low calorie menu that my boyfriend loves also. Prices are good, and it's nice to go to a restaurant that's open after 10pm that isn't Denny's!

Tim M.,"Calimesa, CA",5,13,1,3.0,7/20/2015,It's always a disappointment when you walk in a place and get ignored. Evidently the bar maid is the waitress as well.

And I really feel like their doing a good job.

Andrea M.,"Beaumont, CA",3,29,1,2.0,6/25/2016,"I worked in food service for years and let me say , I was Very disappointed in the service, cleanliness and food. The host was difficult to understand. He kept mumbling and we had to keep asking him to repeat himself, which became very irritating the third time around. We waited about 10 minutes for a server to even greet us. We had already decided what we wanted to eat and drink by the time she got to us. She said she ""forgot"" that our table was in her section. Pretty embarrassing to admit, I think. When it came to ordering, I asked if I could substitute fruit for fries; I'm pregnant and I REALLY wanted fruit. The server said they didn't have fruit. Well, I looked at my daughter's kid's menu and they at least had apple dippers. Hello, the place IS called Applebees for Pete's sake. She could have offered me those considering that IS fruit, but no! The server showed me other sides I could choose from that wouldn't cost me extra, so I chose the grains and rice side. A few minutes later she came back and said, ""I'm sorry, I just found out I will have to charge you for the rice side. Is that ok?"". Of course it was NOT ok, and by then I was so irritated I just let my husband choose a side that sounded good to him that he could have. For her mistake, they should have given me the original side I wanted without the extra charge. The food was nothing special, and it was served to us on a table that was haphazardly wiped down, smelled like an old rag and felt sticky. Oh, and my daughter's highchair was delivered to us dripping wet in the middle by the mumbling host and was also sticky. I wiped it down myself. Just an overall unpleasant experience and a complete waste of $30, which included a very generous tip of $3. TIPS stands for ""to improve proper service"" and the service was nothing close to being proper. Very sad, and we will definitely not be returning.

I have a stomach issue that will not allow me to eat raw cabbage. She just told me, ""Too bad"" and then refused to take my order.

Mark L.,"Beaumont, CA",199,130,96,1.0,8/19/2015,"This review in no way reflects on the service of Applebees. The employees were quite nice even though they mentioned they were short staffed that day and we had to wait an extra 20 minutes. The diarrhea inducing food on the other hand is worth negative stars. My food actually tasted great even if it looked like someone scooped it out of the trash and put it on the plate. My wife hated her food and said it was the most bland crap that she's ever had. After lunch we both became violently ill and we attest it to the shrimp and undercooked chicken that were on both of our plates.  Oh, and the price of 2 days of diarrhea? $81 for four people. The food is way overpriced for what you get. I guess if you want to lose weight quickly and have tape worms eat away at your body it's the best place to go in the city other than eating a pile of garbage under the bridge. My wife had to miss work the next day. They also have these tablets on the table where you can play games against other people which would be nice but they actually add a charge to your bill if you play them. Again, service was good. They looked stressed out which is probably why we got food poisoning. Our family has vowed never to go back. We will give any gift cards we receive to Applebees to our enemies.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-beaumont-3?start=20
Derek C.,"Menifee, CA",100,76,199,3.0,3/3/2016,"I'm definitely a fan of Applebees because I frequently order their lunch specials during the week.  Food is great, but since I'm used to picking up and waiting in the car, they have been hit and miss on even seeing me in my car waiting for the food to come out.  Most of the time, I will have to walk in so they realize I'm waiting.  I was once even told that they really don't carry out to the car, and I have to come in to get my food.  Kind of defeats the purpose if you ask me.  Service is always ok though and I can't complain about that or the food.  It's just that I've been to better Applebee's before.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-beaumont-3?start=20

Most recently we visited on a holiday (July 4th), well after lunch hour. The restaurant was not busy at all, however service was very slow. Our Server was pretty much invisible the entire time and never checked back once our meals were served. I think she had two tables. As a hospitality professional, I understand that sometimes a Server is having a bad day and is not on their best game, so I always tip, regardless of service quality. However, the better you serve me, the better your gratuity.

It looked and tasted like it had been frozen or it could have came out of a can. Don't get the nachos, it didn't even come with sour cream.  The chicken quesadillas were probably the best thing out of everything. And the mozzarella sticks are pretty standard frozen shit lol  My sons food was a joke! So you offer juice boxes but charge extra for a second, at chillis my kid can have as many as his little heart desires. His fries were cold and the three little chicken stripes were frozen and deep fried lol  Everything comes frozen, doesn't it!!!

Henry C.,"Torrance, CA",3328,403,8,4.0,9/4/2012,"Here is my new discovery to late night dining...  Although there aren't any Applebee's near me, but if I'm in a neighborhood with one, I'd be very happy to be a frequent patron there!  Don't ask me why I'm all the way out in Beaumont, but hopefully all the other Applebee's can model after this one... Applebee's is a Denny's-like diner except with much better food in my opinion... They have their famous special of either 2 for $20 or 2 for $24 with  an addition of a free full size appetizer included!  (Always pick the chicken wings for the best value!) but what I truly love is their 50% appetizers during happy hour! So what makes this Beaumont location different?  They allow all appetizers to be priced at 50% during happy hours!  YES!  ALL OF THEM!!!  Also, happy hour is anywhere in the restaurant not pertained to only the bar area... (Be sure to check with each of the Applebee's location about what exactly they are offering during happy hour!) What are my favorites? **Boneless chicken wings... (Beaumont location allows to be either bone in or boneless to be included in the happy hour special) **Cheeseburger sliders **Wonton Tacos **Onion rings Imagine... all these large portioned appetizers priced from $6.49 up to $9.99, but during happy hours, the prices ranges from $3.25 to about $5 bucks!  The portion stays the same too!!! One tip!  Should you be shopping at the Desert Hill Premium Outlets, this would be great place to have a late dinner after a long day of shopping!  It's probably only 7 minutes or so going 10 Westbound! Also, service here is great (Served by Kathleen)!  But the parking is tricky so be sure to pay attention when trying to get into this place.... not sure why they would setup their parking lot entrance like this.... Next time you are out late and there is an Applebee's nearby, be sure to check out their happy hour special!  Remember, HH happens between 3-6pm and 9p-close!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-beaumont-3?start=60

I considered throwing it out, but since it's been at least five years since I ate at an Applebee's, I decided to give it another shot. I ordered a bacon cheddar grilled chicken sandwich, and triple chocolate meltdown dessert. The latter was fine, but then again, it's difficult to screw up a brownie and vanilla ice cream. The fries had enough salt on them that I couldn't eat them. The sandwich was terrible - a thick slab of rubbery, reheated chicken that barely exceeded the quality of a bagged, microwaveable sandwich from a grocery store. Even having not spent a dime of my own money on the food, I still felt like I'd been ripped off, given that they had the audacity to charge $25 for a meal that, absent the brownie, was equivalent to food I would expect to find in a school cafeteria, or maybe a prison.

David R.,"Rancho Mirage, CA",171,34,53,4.0,9/30/2013,This place is terrific.  Bathrooms are so clean and the food surprisingly delicious. Not the Applebee's I remember in the past.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-beaumont-3?start=80
Mike F.,"Beaumont, CA",0,144,7,1.0,8/16/2012,Horrible Applebee's. We go there every 6 months to see if anything has changed. It never has. Horrible service. It takes forever to get your food. The food is always cold.  Not sure why they can't get it together.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-beaumont-3?start=80
Panda G.,"Temecula, CA",58,46,17,5.0,9/26/2012,I come here often for Happy Hour. I love the prices and the bartender Gary is pretty cool and very helpful. I've never had a single rude server.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-beaumont-3?start=80

Tyler M.,"Banning, CA",0,15,,1.0,1/28/2014,Every time I come here I leave disappointed. That usually never happens to me at a restaurant. The food along with the service is just too mediocre. Since this always happens to me here I had to only give it one star. Sorry but not sorry,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-beaumont-3?start=80
One P.,"Beaumont, CA",0,3,,1.0,1/1/2014,"Second time here in two years coming here received a gift card for x-mas having dinner with my wife on new years eve. The hostess greeted us sat us down at a booth and then we waited. The restaurant was fairly busy being new years eve it was approximately 4:PM. We sat there as a waitress walked by us 2-3 times, after 15 min another waiter walked by and took the order of the booth right next to us that had been there for no more than 5 min, wow. My wife was saying how other parties around us were being waited on while we sat for a glass of ice water, my wife then requested to go somewhere else and I was more than happy. Wow, terrible service if I was a Manager there I would not be happy. We then left and went to El Charros, it was great, thank you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-beaumont-3?start=80

Paul J.,"Shawnee, OK",0,28,,4.0,2/24/2009,"The previous reviewer is not from this area so I sort of get her review. If you live in this area, we really do not have many choices and Applebees is really one of the better places to eat around here IMHO.  Heather O. and Jireh - top notch wait staff! Ask for them by name! Excellence in customer service and very attentive.  Trish is an outstanding manager. She cares about her peeps and cares about your experience. If it is not right, she will make sure it is made right.  Sometimes the food can be hit or miss but if you have the right people serving you, the food will be right too! They will make sure of it.  I eat here once a week or so but I make sure I go in when my favorite peeps are working.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-beaumont-3?start=80
