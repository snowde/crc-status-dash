So we thought we try that new special going on. I got th 12oz and it was tasty, the parts I got to eat. I know a good steak has some fat. But this was a lot. I ate around it, no big deal. Our server was Brandon, I believe. He was great! On top of everything. Polite all the way thru too.

Baltazar R.,"Beaverton, OR",45,40,125,1.0,1/1/2018,"MISSING MENU ITEMS topped off with BAD ATTITUDE. After driving 6 hours we were looking forward to visiting our usual restaurant, which we love because the good price, fair treatment and kids love to use the tablets' games. Today was different.... No milk, no chocolate milk, no apple juice nor french fries. Ok, we can deal with that and order other things from menu. What we can't stand is bad service from the waitress. She literally said ""Well, it's a restaurant... It happens "". Maybe she thought it was funny but after a few interactions we noticed she was about to walk out the door (And we would have applauded that!). We'll fill out the survey and notify headquarters about this because we really love this chain, we actually had a great experience at another Applebee's just two days ago!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-beaverton-2
Patricia G.,"Beaverton, OR",32,102,183,1.0,10/16/2017,Years ago I went to Applebee's on a regular basis. I haven't been here in a very long time. I didn't remember why until tonight.  Service: has to be the slowest service of anywhere I've been. You can't even waive down your sever. I was able to order my sons food and it was served before I could even order mine.

Zoey M.,"Beaverton, OR",0,36,21,4.0,4/8/2017,"It seems like I may have had an unusual dining experience here in that it was quite pleasant for me and my family. I have only now checked Yelp reviews for this place after the fact and am pretty shocked at other's experiences. Then again, I am not too picky and I ask for very little: good tasting food and decent customer service.  We went here on a Saturday afternoon after seeing how packed Sweet Tomatoes was. Applebees wasnt too busy and the nice hostess actually opened the door for us. We were quickly seated at a booth by the window. We had Brandon as our server and he was excellent! He had a nice attitude, didnt rush us to order, didnt check on us too much (I hate when waiters do that), and never left us with an empty glass.  I got the shrimp and parmesan top sirloin steak with steamed broccoli and garlic green beans. It was sooo good! The steak was tender and cooked the way I wanted (medium). My husband got the ee brisket tacos and fries which he said was delicious, and my daughter had the mac n cheese which she enjoyed as well. We ordered the artichoke dip for an appetizer, which was pretty standard but good, and we skipped dessert. Not sure what people expect from a chain restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-beaverton-2
Janet M.,"Portland, OR",294,901,2981,2.0,6/11/2016,"Yeah. My bad.  So I was tired, sick of people,  and had been suffering with ongoing horrendous back pain when my child texted ""I want salmon""....not cooking. NFW.  Hmm what to do. I mean she doesnt always get what she wants but I figured it was doable, so why not? I really knew better.  I thought I'd try their ""curbside to go.""Fish options, no real human interactions, and I could stay in the car. Awesome, right?  I ordered online and headed over. They told me it'd be ready in ten. It was closer to 20.  The kid was nice and friendly. The food was dispatched quickly. It was still hot when I got it home ten minutes later.  But my $4 side salad was missing. We both had meals and salads so I had looked and observed four containers, two small and two large, and I thought it was cool. But my baked potato was in the fourth box not the MIA salad.  Sigh.  My bbq ribs were ok. Small. But lean and tender. Baked potato was fine. ""Fire roasted veggies"" just were not great. Two enormous chunks of squash and a few squares of red bell pepper.   Child's salmon was overcooked and not seasoned. She ate a bite or two, offered some to the cat ( he sniffed and walked away) and we trashed the rest. She did not like the ""rubbery"" broccoli. Garlic mashed taters with cheese were pronounced ""edible."" Her side Caesar is still in the fridge two days later. The romaine was dark and wilty. Not appealing.  It was all VERRRRRRRY salty. Like wake -up -in- the' night -parched- like -youre -in -the- desert, salty.  So. Kind of a bust.  Chains. I really shouldn't try them. Another yelper said drinking would help.  So, maybe try that? If I have the urge to do curbside lazy chain takeout again Ill do that ""Chinese"" place. It's salty too, but at least my order all makes it into the bag.  And as Princess pointed out, we actually LIKE that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-beaverton-2
Felicia N.,"Belltown, Seattle, WA",86,145,227,2.0,7/13/2016,"Went out for dinner with the family on a Tuesday night here, which is kid's night woohoo! My little brothers ate off the kids menu for less than $2 each. One of them ordered the grilled cheese and barely touched it. He loves grilled cheeses but there was something off about this one... Dad and I did the 2 for $25 deal that comes with an appetizer to share and two entrees. I ordered the Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp and dad got the Baby Back Ribs in Chipotle sauce with grilled veggies and garlic green beans on the side. We got the spinach and artichoke dip for our appetizer and were disappointed. We liked the salsa that came out with the chips better than the dip itself, hah.  The Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp was WAY TOO GREASY. It came with a pat of herb butter on the chicken that I removed immediately, but the entire dish was drenched in oil still. The sauteed onions and mushrooms were overcooked on the sizzling pan and were lost to the grease. The portion size was great, the shrimp was cooked well, but the chicken was a little dry (maybe that's what all the grease is for...). The dish came with a side of fried potatoes. Yay, more grease. Can you tell that the excessive fat ruined the dish for me? Dad's dish was delicious. The meat fell off the bones of the ribs and the grilled veggies were clean and fresh. The garlic green beans were greasy also, but mixed with the grilled veggies it wasn't too bad. Overall, good bang for your buck but beware of the fat content in the food that you're getting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-beaverton-2
Lora R.,"Phoenix, AZ",34,69,22,1.0,9/29/2017,"Visiting from Arizona. Came here with my mom, Aunt, daughter & daughter's friend. Sever asked if we wanted seperate checks, my daughter said that her and friend were on same check & I said the remaining 3 would be on the other check. (This will be important towards the end of this post.) On to the food. My Aunt just wanted a salad & baked potatoe, loaded. Server explains that its $2 upcharge to have it loaded - Aunt says ok but asks if loaded meant bacon, sour cream, cheese & chives to which server replied ""yes"". Mom orders ""butcher meat & potatoes"" entree which is supposed to have mashed potatoes but she requests a loaded baked potatoe instead, knowing the same $2 upcharge will apply (we didn't know until we got the check that they also charge ANOTHER $2 to sub the bake for the mash). These baked potatoes were poorly ""loaded"" (and didn't have chives) & were cold. Mom's butcher meat was however plentifully loaded with gristle. I ordered the burbon chicken & shrimp which was way overcooked & chicken was inedible - at that point I asked for something else (Lemon pepper chicken mac m cheese - was mediocre at best - the dog didn't even like it - however she did like the butcher meat). So we basically had expensive dog food with awful service. She didn't even check back at appropriate intervals to make sure everything was ok. I had to get up & go to the bar to request condiment. The girl brings the checks (we're supposed to have 2). My daughter is paying for her & friend & I'm paying for the rest of us as we stated when she asked in the first place. We pay cash because the way she's explaining to how to pay with cards sounds like we need a tech degree on their table machine. I'm sure its not that serious but she was a mess explaining. So while we're getting our cash together the server is standing there hovering over us like we're trying to dine n dash or something. I was kind of stuck where I was seated, but as I was able to get out I dropped the cash on the table in front of her & she gave me a snide ""thaaaaaannnnnks"".  Then our little group is standing outside chatting before parting ways & out comes our server in a very accusatory manner saying that we didn't pay for one of the guests & was very rude about it. Finally (to make a long story short) it gets figured out that she split the check 3 ways instead of 2. The friend didn't notice & neither did the rest of us because we were only thinking about 2 checks! So the friend pays her for the missing meal, but wow this girl was so unprofessional. Definitely won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-beaverton-2
Tabatha P.,"Hillsboro, OR",718,257,464,2.0,3/22/2017,"I decided to give it a try, since we had seemed to try everything else in the area. Their service was awesome, I really enjoy how we were treated there. From the door to exiting, just top notch customer service.  My compliant is the food choices. There was hardly anything I could eat or was interested in eating. I have high lactose intolerance, and my food without cheese was extremely limited and extremly bland. Many choices were fried, fattening, high calorie, and all around bad for you.  The place had TVs everywhere, which I understand people like their sports, but there were too many and it was overwhelming.

Shanae B.,"Portland, OR",22,80,31,2.0,1/13/2017,"I'm bringing my rating up a little bit but this location has still not impressed me much.  The food was good, nice and hot and we were checked on about half a dozen times which actually was a little annoying but not terribly off-putting (and was the exact opposite of my last experience).  What irritated me today was that my brother was brought a drink that he didn't order but the waitress said it was an extra and not to worry about it. Ok, cool.  Then, because it was my brothers birthday, he got what was supposed to be a free desert which we requested in a to-go container so he could eat it later.  Then we got the bill and found out that the waitress charged us for the drink and for the free Birthday dessert because we requested it to-go.  The argument was not worth the $5 savings.  It probably goes without saying but my $10 tip on a $35 bill was reduced to a $5 tip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-beaverton-2

Jason F.,"San Francisco, CA",18,236,17,2.0,4/25/2016,"Simply dreadful.   The bourbon chicken and shrimp can only be described as strange.  The weird butter (?) sauce on it tasted like someone grabbed whatever herbs were sitting around and threw them together.  The shrimp was overly chewy and tasted a bit off.  The potatoes were undercooked and flavorless. I also made the mistake of ordering their steak, which borders on inedible.  Tough, fatty, and overcooked. They do have decent (albeit weak) drinks though and the staff is nice.

We all got a full sized meals despite of our original plan to have happy hour items. My friend ordered riblets which came out a little burnt to which he got a whole new plate of ribs that were made well.

We thought she was great. -The food* totally edible-- I'll dive in more in the cons... -wait time was probably about 5-10 minutes on a Thursday at dinner time, totally reasonable. -food arrived pretty fast after ordering, drinks were refilled when we wanted and plates cleared up not too long after finishing-- all great stuff! Cons: - the waiting area seats like 5 people maybe... And the couple sittings in the corner had family come in and all try to squeeze in.... Making it super awkward for us the couple standing because theirs no seats, and the other couple seated. Too close for comfort. -The table we sat at was clean, but the hairs had food on them. -the food pt II: I ordered medium on my steak, got well done-- definitely not a deal breaker cause it was still pretty good, BUT the menu and the real deal were night and day.

It tasted good, so I can't complain too much. My fear though is that the calorie counts provided are not accurate when too much sauce is placed on the dish. Not sure if they are following the recipe to the ""T"" there. The noise level wasn't too bad and every table was taken. Music was good. Deserts looked divine.

And then he stared at us as if he'd never seen queer people before. Granted, we are more rare in this area, but COME ON! 2. The food should be a touch above fast food quality, especially for the price. We ordered the appetizer sampler for $12.99, plus the french onion soup (the only real highlight of our dining experience, and even that I am told, by my more experienced french onion soup eating boyfriend, was mediocre). I found great irony when a taco bell commercial came on one of the many TV screens that their quesadillas taste so much better than those in our sampler.

Janice S.,"Seattle, WA",14,155,103,3.0,4/22/2011,"So, I heart applebees.  One of my favorite places to eat and drink.  I love how you can drink here for hours and they won't try to rush you out.   This particular location was super busy on a Friday night at dinnertime. So 9:00 rolls around and they have this DJ on his mic announcing it's karaoke night. Supposedly they do this every Friday which is very unexpected of applebees.  Although I don't mind it, a lot of people sure did. People came here expecting a nice and quiet dinner.  Come on, it's a family restaurant.  The couple next to us complained about it and asked to get their food boxed up to go because they were so upset. The one thing they should do is post a sign outside so that customers know what to expect on a Friday night.   Other than that, applebees is a great place to eat, drink and hang out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-beaverton-2?start=80
Diva A.,"Beaverton, OR",1,154,15,3.0,2/10/2014,"Nothing terribly special or horrible about this place. Parking is a bit stupid, but I can get over that. Usually chain restaurants can get at least four stars from me, but there is really, utterly, nothing fantastic that has stood out to me since I've been coming here.  Service is mediocre at best, at times we're left a ""few minutes"" too long to look at the menu. I don't know what servers do if they don't actually serve me ANYTHING. Every time we've come, there is a new person bringing out anything for us. The server will take our orders and some other person will be running it out to us. A different person for drinks, a different person for appetizers, a different person for our meals. I don't know if this is normal but it's a pain in the ass. I can't find my server for anything because they don't bring me anything, and when I ask the person who brings me something, most of the time I can tell they sure as hell don't want to bring it to me. Or they drop something off and run away so fast I can't ask anyways. I don't feel really good about tipping highly because the server didn't actually do anything for me, all the people running their food did. I've wondered if I should hand each person giving me something a dollar instead of tipping...hmm... Food is decent, two for twenty all the time. Nothing to make my mouth water but on a budget it's alright. It's the food you'd probably cook at home yourself but since you don't want to buy all the ingredients and do the time, probably coupled with cabin fever and wanting to get out of your shitty apartment...then yes, Applebee's forever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-beaverton-2?start=80

Chuck S.,"Portland, OR",48,180,9,3.0,2/25/2010,"I decided to dedicate some time to hanging out with my mom on my birthday.  She asked if I wanted to go somewhere for lunch, and since I've been cutting back drastically on fast food/restaurant chains, I thought I'd take her up on the offer.  Normally, I'd go to Old Chicago for a calzone, but I decided to buck the trend.  I had a craving for a Chicken Broccoli Pasta Alfredo Bowl (they really need to re-name this meal). On this particular day, I was constantly reminded of my days at Westview High School up 185th.  Typical Applebee's fashion of having a glass case full of WHS ""memorabilia.""  Two girls, who were most likely skipping class, splitting an appetizer plate.  And our server, Matt, also attended Westview and graduated the same year I did.  I wonder if this is exactly what Bill and T.J. Palmer had in mind with their ""Neighborhood Bar & Grill"" pitch. The food and service is not atypical of the Applebee's meals you've eaten at any location before.  It's overpriced for what it is, but it's not -horrible- (kind of like Reggie Bush in the NFL...ZING!).  The CBPAB looked and tasted just like the one I had in Springfield a few months prior. Overall, just another visit to (an) Applebee's.  Glad to know there's one close to home.  Also glad to know there's other restaurants off 185th to go to next time.  Best word to describe the experience: ""meh."" NOTE: Almost tempted to attend their ""Late Night"" hours, just to see at what kind of attempt they make at being more of a bar and less of a grill, and to be ""that guy"" who got drunk at Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-beaverton-2?start=80
