Kelsey N.,"Bolingbrook, IL",3,31,,3.0,8/25/2007,"Agreeing with whoever wrote the other review, the food isn't really fantastic... I'd easily rather go across the street to either fridays or chilis or something. The pastas here are always dry and bland, the steaks are chewy, and the burgers are ok, but they're burgers... you can't really mess them up. But the desserts indeed are very good, however you can't really mess those up either can you?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bolingbrook
Michelle I.,"Bolingbrook, IL",290,389,108,1.0,12/8/2007,"Very mediocre! As far a chain restaurant goes, I much rather go to another! Very average food, unfriendly management. $50 for lunch- pisses me off- what a waste! When I think of all the other places around here I could of had an awesome lunch for the same $$! Oh well, it's done and won't come back! There is a reason Applebees is the slowest restaurant around here...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bolingbrook
