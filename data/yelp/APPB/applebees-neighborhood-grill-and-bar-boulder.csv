jill l.,"Culver City, CA",10,51,,4.0,8/22/2011,"Before you judge me judging Applebee's, I want you to hear me out. One, anyone who ventures forth into an Applebee's knows exactly what they're signing up for. So, I don't want to hear any of that- ew, Applebee's type of shit. Two, I went on a Tuesday and that is the sole reason why Applebee's is getting 4 stars from me. Here we go.  Tuesday is Karaoke Night at Applebee's. You're probably thinking, WTF? Yes, so was I! At first I was terrified. But then as I started eating my artery clogging order (mostly deep fried breaded something or another) and took a long hard gaze at my surroundings & newfound compatriots, I started to appreciate Applebee's for all that it was. To the right of the bar, a man was singing his heart out to ""He's got the whole world in his hands"" to my immediate right, a bunch of loving friends all wearing camouflage gear. They might have had blood smeared on their faces after huntin' some deer- I don't know- but I do know I have never witnessed a stronger orb of friendship than that radiating from that table. We all drank, people sang, and I didn't feel so lonely anymore. It was like the world was right, just as baby jesus intended it to be.  I don't think this review does it justice. It was like watching a movie except I was actually there. So good. So damn good, I think I'm going to cry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-boulder
Zubey L.,"Boulder, CO",5,114,4,2.0,3/15/2012,"Applebee's, Chili's, TGI fridays.. pretty much the same resturant.. although I don't recall Applebee's having so much fried and frozen meals.    its like all other chains... they were good.. and now .. not so much.  I guess this place is holding up trader joe's from moving in as well. lol",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-boulder
Courtney T.,"Saint Louis, MO",31,53,35,2.0,11/17/2010,"I can't even believe I'm writing a review for Applebees, but I felt the need to say something, if there is ANYONE out there looking up Applebees on Yelp. First of all, it was just about the only place in Boulder we could go to eat, with a waiter, after 10 pm. They are open 'til midnight. There really isn't much else open that late in Boulder if you want sit down service. (That I can think of. Please enlighten me if I am wrong.) The funny thing is, it's RIGHT on 28th street. And I've driven up and down that street plenty of times, but had NO IDEA there was an Applebees.  So when we get in there, of course there's only a handful of others in there. But the surprising thing was, they had Karaoke! On a Tuesday night...at Applebees....when there really isn't anyone going there in the first place. It was SO LOUD. I mean we had a really hard time having a conversation when the DJ was talking or people were ""singing"". Now, I don't hate karaoke, it's ok in a bar or of course at Outback Saloon, but Applebees?  I guess I wasn't expecting a fancy dining experience anyway, but I thought at least I could enjoy talking while I was there. The other thing is that the menu is not vegetarian friendly. I actually am a pescetarian (yeah, pretentious word, I know, but I eat seafood), so we got the shrimp appetizer which was pretty good, but I wouldn't really order any other fish at applebees, so I just had pasta. Sadly, we wanted to get the 2 entrees, app, for $20, but EVERY entree had meat. And I didn't want to confuse the Applebees cooks by ordering something without meat. I'm sure it wouldn't come out right. Our waiter was very attentive and nice, no complaints there. And apps were half price. So not bad there either. But you know what you are expecting when you come here, you are just now forewarned about the horribly loud Karaoke.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-boulder
Colie J.,"Lafayette, CO",13,208,105,2.0,4/13/2010,"My first time at this one but I was immediately reminded why I rarely visit an Applebees. Slow service and mediocre food. Hubby and I both agreed we wouldn't be back for the food. This one has Wii games, karioke, and bingo so we may try one of these late night activities.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-boulder
Dan D.,"San Francisco, CA",1066,84,3,5.0,3/12/2007,I just love this place.  The chicken tenders with the dressing?!?  OH YEAH...have your tried the appetizer sampler?  Go for it... Dessert do the brownie and ice cream.   This place made me feel better after the 70 was closed and we had to pause our Copper Mountain trip by a day...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-boulder
Penelope W.,"San Francisco, CA",61,385,95,2.0,3/14/2007,"I used to work at an Applebee's (Neighborhood Grill & Bar) and I can safely say.....the food does not come out in 12 minutes (especially if I am your waitress).  So then, if you don't want your food in 12 minutes or less and you're looking for some large portioned mediocre nonsense (though, the southwestern salad is pretty good [if you want to get fat (or if it is the only meal you are going to eat)]).     And once, I got in a killa car wreck (really!) on my way to work....incidentally blocking the intersection for hours....so, there's that.  It will do...for a chain.  Generic shmernic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-boulder
