KAROL C.,"Bronx, NY",20,73,58,1.0,4/25/2015,"Third Ave and Fordham Road location. While  the service may be quick, waiting for your drinks is too long!  The food arrives before the drinks!  This place was packed on a Friday  and one bartender!  Not worth the wait for the wait, the food is basically tasty, however  the adult beverage situation  is terrible!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bronx-11?start=40
Kristen F.,"Staten Island, NY",110,49,135,1.0,12/3/2015,This place sucks... slow inattentive service. The only reason to come here is if you want to drink flat beer from a dirty line or be ignored.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bronx-11?start=40
Dayshon H.,"West Bronx, NY",0,2,,1.0,6/24/2016,wish I could give negative stars....came on a Friday 6:30 (3 adults 2 kids)  asked about happy hour and was told it was until 11pm we were seated almost an half an hour later in the upstairs section our hostess seats us and 2 minutes later takes our happy hour menus and apologized because it was 7:00 and happy hour ended when we explained that we were told by our host happy hour was until 11 she replied he was new. We asked to speak with the manager (Al Clark) and he tried to explain it was a mistake and reluctantly comped us one round of happy hour drinks...As we were waiting for of food the restaurant was not well ventilated in the upstairs section and with all the flame cooked food it became very smoky and the fire alarm kept going off...we were so uncomfortable the only good thing was our server (Brooke) she was very accomodating but clearly over worked...update we got our bill and he only comped us 1 drink 1 at happy hour price and 1 was full price,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bronx-11?start=40
S P.,"Newark, NJ",12,10,11,2.0,9/6/2015,"I find it hard to be disappointed at a place like Applebee's, since the menu is no surprise and the prices are reasonable. It's a beer, wings, or burger type place for myself.  I was in NY visiting a friend, we chose to hang out here for a drink or two, and I must say the service behind the bar sucked. There was no Heineken on tap, the Samuel Adams was flat, and the Coors Light had a weird odor to it.  Our bartender spent more time away from the bar than behind it.  Luckily my friend and I didn't make a big fuss over it as we were just trying to catch up and enjoy ourselves.  I should of known from the beginning of our visit as my friend asked for a water and the bartender completely forgot it and finally, like 20 mins later, my friend had to remind her and ask for a water again. I didn't look for any names, but I just had to say, as someone who has had some great experiences with great service at Applebee's in my home area, I was like damn, this Applebee's sucks...lol. Like I said I didn't take names, but I do know our bartender was dressed as Wonder Woman. They were having a best costume contest for the employees. And on a better note, when the shift changed, our 2nd bartender, dressed as Cat Woman was much more attentive and took care of us normally. So peace to  Cat Woman lol for her i give 2 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bronx-11?start=40

Bella L.,"Methuen, MA",72,182,183,5.0,3/28/2013,"My favorite Applebee's location. Employees make you feel so welcomed and valued and it seems the Chef takes a little extra time in preparing your food just right. The service is great and the food is delicious. I've visited a few other Applebee's but this one is my favorite. I did have a negative encounter once but just like they say to turn a frown upside, that is exactly what the manager did. She fixed that issue right up! so I do not stress that one time. My favorite is the Cajun Shrimp Pasta, favorite drink is the Sangria and I try to fit in the Triple Chocolate Melt if I am not that full. It is so good and they let you know, it's real Haagen Daz ice cream served with it. The bar is also cool here, especially sports nights. Those sport fans turn into comedians.

I was not hungry so as my friend ordered meals I order a dessert ( the chocolate lava cake with ice cream ). Not only did our order take a hour to make. But I was served my dessert with peanut. I chose that dessert knowing it was not served with nuts but when I bite into it I had a peanut. Thank goodness I  had a minor allergic reaction to it which is a itchy throat. I just drank alcohol.

The moment my girlfriend and I got there it was ok at the beginning but after the main course got on the table no one asked how we were doing. We have to wait more then 30 minutes to see the waiter again after waiting  for so long my girlfriend and I decided to order dessert that was another 20 mins waiting for it.

Monique D.,"Greenwich, CT",39,32,10,1.0,6/10/2015,I've been to this location several times.The waiters always have gotten SOMETHING wrong. The food is barely ok. It tastes like school lunch. The employees are overall have attitudes. A young Caucasian waitress kept speaking to my go up and I in an unprofessional/ slang. (My group was over 30 and polished looking) Don't know what made her think we speak that way. Very sweet girl but some of the Ebonics she used made us uncomfortable. (slang is one thing but how she spoke to us was not natural slang even for an urban area) Just a very weird experience. We laughed it off. Forgive me if I offend anyone.

When we were seated she mumbled something about the 2/$20 and walked off. The place was warm, no AC or it was low so that's always nice. But our server, Alexandria was really nice and attentive.

Alessandro T.,"Manhasset, NY",3,31,12,2.0,1/21/2015,"What can I say about this place which I frequent about once every couple weeks? Well the the beers flat, food takes about an hour to come, and my favorite part is the rude obnoxious bartenders. Well not obnoxious because that would mean they would interact with you, we'll leave it at rude, slow and incompetent. I continue to go here because it's usually a humorous venture for me and my buddies and we have a good time despite the gremlins behind the bar. The food has been good most of the time and I've tired a variety of dishes from this place. My advice is DO NOT SIT AT THE BAR if you would like any kind of decent service. The bartenders here have earned this Applebee's two stars along with the flat beer.

Bonisha V.,"East Bronx, NY",3,5,,1.0,9/17/2015,"Service was not that great. I asked for a French onion soup & when it finally arrived if looked as if it was preheated the bowl was hot but the cheese and bread were so hard. Then I sat there 20 min waiting for my next soup and it never came. When the waiter approached my table I asked what happened to the soup he said h said it didn't look good and didn't suggest another so I didn't bring it  I was so mad because wasn't he supposed to suggest another? Anyhow as my husband and I sat there and waited for our food 4 waiters came with appetizers and I asked why are they bring this and they said we ordered it mind you we never ordered appetizers just the soup that I was dying to eat that unfortunately I never got. The food was good, but the service sucked and My husband still tipped very well, but what ever.  I'm still upset at the fact that I didn't get that soup. I'm expecting and I needed that soup.

The manager was offended that we had said something about the poor service. They added on food that we didn't ask for. The portions were so small for an unreasonable price. Some of the food ordered was NOT cooked. And I feel kind of weird  after leaving the restaurant. And they added money to the food when it cost something totally different. They tried to take an extra 40 dollars from me. Just horrible. Will not go there ever again. And hopefully others don't go either.

This place is set up nice but still nothing special to brag about. It always seems to be jammed packed but you never have to wait to be seated. The longest I've ever waited was maybe 5 minutes at most. One thing that I must say is that I feel the females workers are always dressed inappropriately some wear head scarfs, tank tops with boobs hanging out and half of the time the girls look like they're going to the club after work. I think the females should wear button down shirts just like the guys.

Frances D.,"Bronx, NY",68,24,3,5.0,5/13/2011,Finding great customer service is sometimes harder than trying to find a needle in a hay stack... I believe it also depends on your waiter and management... My family and I went to Apple Bee's so that we could celebrate my girlfriends birthday... The kitchen was backed up so our food took a while but our waiter Brett was heaven sent. I have a mentally disabled child and he tends to act out every so often especially when plates are being taken away and Brett was very understanding. I ordered a medium well steak and it was bought to me well done. Brett took my plate away and returned to inform my there was a rush on my steak.... A few minutes later the Manager Quie came out with him and stood table side to make sure my steak was fine... He stated that if that steak wasn't done to my liking he would return it yet again and bring me another... My steak at first sight wasn't exactly what I wanted and I just said it was fine as I felt they went through enough trouble to appease me and my family and he mentioned that I didn't look please and that all I had to do was say the word and he would give me another steak.... As I cut more I realized the steak was perfectly fine... I originally order the house sirloin and was given a porter house for it not being right the first time..... I must say for a large party as mine our waiter never showed distress or impatience and the manager was WONDERFUL! it is definitely a place I recommend.. There are many young waiters and waitresses and I too have been there and had not so good service... Everyone isnt great and everyone isn't horrible... But in my opinion their manager Quie is the best around Side note* my mother ordered a drink and it wasn't weak it was actually pretty strong!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bronx-11?start=80

Natasha S.,"Bronx, NY",29,62,60,2.0,4/19/2011,"I came here this past sunday to have dinner with my hubby. First of all I am used to going to the Applebees in Bay Plaza. Even though that one is always rather crowded especially on weekends the service is rather good. Now lets talk about the service here. The waiter we had was extra friendly but he definitely was not prompt in bringing our drinks or food. I can't blame him because the drinks come from the bar and the food comes from the kitchen so technically the slowness of everything is not his fault. It is very aggaravating though when you have to wait 20 minutes for drinks and 45 minutes for your food. What did they do? Go to the farm themselves and kill the chicken and cow to cook it lol. The only thing that came out fast was the appetizer which we ordered. It was boneless buffalo wings which I might add I fell in love with. The waiter was very nice and kept apologizing for the drinks and food taking so long to come out. He even sent the manager over to talk to us when he seen we were getting extremely aggravated waiting so long for our food when we were starving. After all that was said and done the food finally came out and it was actually really delicious. I had the bourbon chicken and shrimp and my hubby had the sirloin steak which we had no complaints about. With our food the waiter also brought over another order of FREE boneless buffalo wings which i was pretty surprised but happy about. We also got a FREE dessert on the house as well which me and the hubby shared. We came out of there stuffed like fat pigs because of all the food we ate. All the food was rather good despite the wait. Although we had to wait so long, hey at least they made up for it because some other places wouldn't even do that. Overall the service isn't the best but the waiter being so nice and the free food we got made up for it. Oh and also they have TV's all over playing whatever sports game is on which can be rather annoying because I feel if you want to watch the game sit at the bar. Everywhere else should be for people wanting to have a nice dinner with friends or family. Once the game is on with a TV displayed everywhere the whole male species ignore whoever they are with just to look at the game. Also men watching the game should keep their voices to a minimum because the players on TV can not hear you and when other people are trying to have a nice peaceful dinner we don't need to be hearing idiots shouting at the TV. Well I guess besides that if you want to take your chances coming to this applebess in the middle of fordham rd thats on you but I would prefer any other applebess over this one!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bronx-11?start=80

All drinks come from the bar and are served by random servers who seem to like plopping drinks down on all tables...appetizers came on time..HUGE nachos portion without which I would have left without any actual food. This applebee's gets 3 stars only because my hubby's meal was done right and came with good timing, the nachos and the alcohol ratio was perfect.  I HOWEVER suffered the misfortune of ordering the salmon dish.... It arrived appearing somewhat normal with deep ""grill"" marks.  Upon my first bite I find that this salmon must have been swimming in coal because the underside was literally so black it could have been carbon! How can you mess up fish? I stopped eating right away and had to wait about 10 or so minutes for our waitress to re-appear from wherever waiters go and dont return....So she hurriedly starts taking it away and asks if I want another one.  Well, I glance at hubby's nearly empty plate and decide it won't be fun to have him stare at me eat for 20-30 minutes...(Hey I'm a slow eater) I told our waiter I didnt want anything else, she sends the floor manager who apologizes and says another salmon will be out in 15 minutes ( Note to the cook fish doesnt take 15 minutes to cook). I say no thanks I've had my drinks and I dont want to wait another 15-30 minutes for more food/drinks.  So she sends over the kitchen manager who apologizes and asks me if there is ANYTHING he can do, ANY dish I would want to eat he would do it ANY way I wanted...By this time I'm weirded out and hubby is surprised at this guy's drive to please me and we're both dreading they'll send someone else over.....It was like if I didnt get something else they would get in trouble...GEESH!

Parmesan is a flavorful cheese.  That is probably why my meal tasted off.  You can't make  Alfred without parmesan.  I was really annoyed that the kitchen was making poor substitutions with the food.  Overall, I say go to a better run Applebee's.  I've had other problems with the Applebee's to go service too at this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bronx-11?start=60

As soon as we sat down the employee grabbed menu's and said follow me. She then sat us but it is very close the front entrance . We had a carrage and a small rolling bag.  It was 3:05 pm other customers that came after us were getting served before us time we got some new tricks to take our order it was 330 and by the time we got our food it was 4 p.m. I was finished by 4:05 because my burger was so light that it took me 5 minutes to eat my wife finished at 4:20. The waitress gave me the bill at 4:53 I waited for her to come back to collect the money but she never came back so I left the money on the table and I told the employees at the door as I did not see the waitress and she says I'm sorry and that was the end of my parients Applebee's If I didn't pay the bill they probably wouldn't never notice anyway. Terrible service at all points. This place needs a manager. The hostess that greeted us was pretty rude and condescending.

To invoke another Floridian culture staple, walking into this Applebee's is like walking into the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror. It can take upwards of ten minutes to be seated, just like the theme park attraction, as the hostess blatantly ignores you or disappears into the proverbial Twilight Zone. The ride only gets worse, though, as the wait staff regularly disregards your table for long stretches of time, forgets to refill your drink, gets your order wrong, or take far too long to give you your check.

Jon H.,"White Plains, NY",21,116,,3.0,12/3/2011,"Ummm, well I recently went with my wife on Veterans Day and they had a nice special; get one Entree and the other one is free - you can't beat that!  My wife ordered a chicken topped salad and I ordered from a special menu provided for Vets Day - a small 7oz steak.  The food was ok but I sure was hungry about an hour later. I guess you get what you don't pay for ha!  As it was crowded we sat by the front door near the hostesses who provided free entertainment - they were actually dancing together to the music being pumped through the restaurant. That was ""interesting"": I'm no prude but it looked a bit odd to see these young women doing dances I last recall seeing done in my military days in a strip bar.  Ummm, I guess the entertainment was free too! Not quite sure that fit with the ""family-theme"" Applebee's tries to put out there.   The only negative was the wait to pay the bill.  We needed to leave quickly and were stuck for an extra 15 minutes with no food or drink in front of us to pay - didn't the waiter want his tip?  A bit odd I thought.  Anyway, I will go back for a special probably but overall I was a bit  underwhelmed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bronx-11?start=60

Never eaten anything I didn't like. Drinks could  use a bit more alcohol but thats all Applebee's not just this one. UFC Fight Nights are a popular event here & its standing room only so I suggest you secure a table early. Good place to hold a private meeting, conference room is available if scheduled in advance, just make sure to confirm the reservation, unfortunately they forgot once though they did prepare the room immediately & we only had to wait about 15 minutes. Parking is easy to find, street parking is available & there is also a parking garage around the corner.

First we ordered classic BUFFLO wings with RANCH AND BUFFLO SAUCE and the waitress told us later that they didnt have anymore wings and she will give us boneless. . FINE. Second, she then brought out BBQ BONELESS wings with just ranch sauce umm we then said ""we wanted bufflo not BBQ"" and she replied saying that she was sorry and that she will take it off our bill. Then when taking our orders, I ordered the steak and mashed potatoes and my friend ordered some shizzling entre, we also wanted BLUE CHEESE CRUMBLES. She came out with our entre's and i said to her ""Excuse me, you forgot the blue cheese crumbles.."" and shes like ""Oh,  sorry and came back with ranch!!

Plus, its college student friendly. This location has some nice Fordham-themed decor! There are old pictures of Fordham Road and the community from like 30-50 years ago? They have a whole in tribute to the athletics and sports at Fordham University. This place even welcomes Fordham students to the upstairs seating lounge where you can overlook the main floor and bar area. It's pretty nice. The burgers are delicious. The artichoke spinach dip is okay; I can pass. The pasta are good. All in all, the food is not bad, actually pretty good. But the service sucks!!

Sarah C.,"New York, NY",154,353,60,3.0,4/29/2010,"You know what? I kind of had fun here. Back before I moved out of the neighborhood, I made Boyfriend take me here because when I was in high my first date was for half price appetizers with two other couples. It was incredibly awkward with bad food, but like most things about high school that were kind of cheesy and awful, you can't help but laugh at them now. So, we went to Applebee's, and pretended to be on Long Island with nowhere to go. I felt mad nostalgic. I felt really happy I didn't have to move home after college. Then we got our food. I got some sort of ridiculous sandwich with bacon and way too much white bread and iceberg lettuce. It came with soggy fries. Boyfriend got a gargantuan burger, also with bacon. We laughed at how deep and wide the booths were, especially after we spotted a table of really fat people who could only sit two abreast. That's when I remembered that Applebee's is kind of disgusting and opening one in this neighborhood is not going to help solve the obesity crisis among the lower class. That was a downer. Still, I like that they've decked the place out in Yankee's and Fordham sports memorabilia, as well as photos of other Bronx attractions. They apparently had so many job applicants here that getting hired was more difficult than getting into Harvard, so the service was good. It was clean and bright, and guess what? After 10, they have half price appetizers and beer. It may not be all that great, but sometimes, it's fun, right?

Albert R.,"Bronx, NY",0,5,,1.0,3/14/2011,"Hey Yelp!  I'm one who is simple in what I like, and that applies for dining out. Good food, and good service. Anything else is just extra that's not expected. But sadly, in this location the food is OK, but the service is something out of a bad movie. As if they are trying to live out a stereotype of the restaurant business. Granted, when I heard this location was gonna open, I was thrilled. He I am, born and raised in this neighborhood, though I spent most of my ""growing"" years going to school in Manhattan as well as working in the city, it was nice to know something that I was use to was going to be ""in the block"" so to speak. I've gone 4 times since it's opened, and every time I go, I just assume that the last visit was a 1 time issue, easily fixed because I asked my self..it can't just be me. We'll the first time I went, which was around when it opened, service was a bit slow. I didn't think much of it. With a new staff and what looked like a young staff..I figured it was a work in progress. The second time, I sat at the bar. I would have to say my appetizers must have taken over 20 mins to come. Which was odd, since it was later at night, and not crowded. The bartender had a tendency to stay on 1 side of the bar, so getting more drinks was just a general hassle. The 3rd...well that was an epic fail. 3 colleagues and myself decide to go eat. We sat in a table, and after waiting about 10 mins for the waiter to come and introduce himself, we all knew it was gonna be an interesting night. We basically ordered before he left, since we  were uncertain the next time he would come, we figured while he is around...why not.  If I didn't witness/be a part of this myself I would have not believed it. For appetizers and 4 salads, it took 1 hour and 25 mins. You read right. 1hr 25 mins. He only came after I walked to him to grab his attention,(about 35 mins in) told him if he could check on our food. He said he would. About 50 mins later he came back (just as we were standing up to leave annoyed at the situation) bringing the food with him. That was about 8 months ago. But tonight after my long hiatus from apple bee's (in all locations- my way of protesting the service) I decided after a quick workout I should get a quick bite to eat. Surely things have changed..right? Not at all. I walk in, I don't notice a hostess. Doesn't really mean anything since she may have been seating someone...(doubtful) I went ahead and walked to the bar and sat down. The Bartender comes over and I informed her I would be eating. She gives me a menu. Could it be? My first good experience...I spoke to soon. I waited about 10 mins for her to come back to order my food. Maybe she figured I needed extra time to order, so I didn't hold that against her. After I ordered, I waited. Well, being a thirsty man after my work out, I wanted some water. Bad move...She finally comes over(she basically stood in one side of the bar) and I ask for some water and it actually works out. Here I am waiting some more, for the food. I would say I waited about 30 mins. Here we go again.. I'm looking around noticing it's not busy, so I can't imagine the kitchen being busy either. Guess what I saw...A guy that looked like he was a COOK coming out with his food and sitting down to eat. I'm a customer...god forbid..I wanna eat at a restaurant in a timely fashion... Finally the food comes..delivered by possibly the runner. As I am finally ready to start my dinner..What's left?? Well..No silverware. No biggie, I'll just ask the bartender. Well..I would have if she did leave to go to the restroom for about 5 mins. I kid you not. I ate my food quickly, and wanted to pay. I was lucky to grab her attention and ask for my check. Well, to say the least, that part of it came within seconds...So your thinking thats the end of the story right?? Nope.. I had to wait another 5 mins to try to pay!!...I waited long enough that I finally saw a manager and asked him if I could pay. He was nice, I could tell he was wondering where the bartender was. I mentioned to him my experience for my dinner. He was pleasant and listened. I hope this letter reaches him. As a person who deals with many people on a daily basis I know things can get fixed. It's a matter of implementing change.  I don't think I have any intention of ever eating at any applebee's ever again. Well, unless I happen to read reviews on yelp and it's glowing. But truth be told in regards to this location..I wouldn't hold my breath. I hope this helps people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bronx-11?start=60

The place was fairly busy and although i was only one person, probably took me about 10 minutes to get seated.  The burgers/fries are only 8.99$ on Monday nights and draft beer like Stella is only 5$ so it was a good deal. I got the quesadilla burger and I think I regret it. It was a fine burger: the salsa tasted fresh but if I am going to go out of my way to eat red meat, this would not my choice. The fries were fine but literally my favorite thing about Applebees is that if you ask for a side of BBQ, they bring you hot (like temperature wise) BBQ and in my humble opinion, everything tastes 2X as good with hot BBQ.   I will go back and get a different burger probably but satisfied for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bronx-11

When she'd ordered this at other locations, little pieces of pickles, onions, and bacon were in the burger - and nothing was in this one.   We had to flag down 3 different servers before our waitress came over (which took about 20 minutes).  This is probably the longest I've had to wait at a restaurant.  When we explained the issue, the waitress argued with us for a bit.  My friend hoped to get the actual burger she ordered, but service had taken so long that we didn't have time.  Ultimately the waitress took the burger off of the bill, but only after much discussion.

First of all there was a 30 minute wait but I guess that's because of the happy hour special. But there was a second floor not being used at all. We ordered appetizers and then our main course. Our main course came first and the lady we bought it not our waitress btw was upset that we asked for our appetizer first. This whole time there was a crowd of about 6 people completely drunk out of their mind at the bar. Being disruptive and loud, to which the bartender kept the drinks coming. I'm almost certain there's a law about how much drinks you can give to someone who is so completely wasted. By the time I got my pasta again it was cold and salty thank god our waitress didn't charge it. Did I mention the cops had to be called. What a night and not in a good way!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bronx-11?start=20
Draya-Renee J.,"Bronx, NY",179,34,60,5.0,12/22/2015,After working out across the way at 24 Hour Fitness I was famished. Made a beeline to Appebees for some eats while i waited for the next metro north train. I got the Asian bone in wings and a Bahama Mama (dont judge me...I'm all about a fitness/life balance yo). At the bar area it was happy hour unbeknownst to me so imagine my surprise when the bill came and the total was $12.68!! Prompt service.  The drinks was done within 5 mins and food came out within 10. The wings are the right combo or tangy and spicy. The drink? I can actually taste the rum!  2 thumbs up. This might become my after gym ritual.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bronx-11?start=20
Rodd R.,"West Bronx, NY",0,1,,2.0,3/23/2016,"Horrible customer service , extremely untrained service and ""hood servers/hostess"" The manager tries to help but not much can be done when the servers and hostess are are simply bringing the place down.

Lucy M.,"Fordham Manor, NY",39,45,8,1.0,3/6/2016,"Worst Customer service. As soon as I walked in there was a huge line and many empty tables. I went up to the hostess tiara and asked her how long was the wait for it table for two she said 15 minutes. She asked for my name but I did it clearly hear her and ask her to repeat what she said, she gave me a really nasty attitude and repeated herself. I sat down for 35 min & still no table. This is the second time I go in and have been treated very poorly. I will never come again to this place",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bronx-11?start=20
Z A.,"Bronx, NY",0,35,,1.0,11/25/2016,"Food was good, but the waitresses and staff were seen eating non-Applebee's food, standing around, and their phones. Drinks were brought out after the food was.

Stephany C.,"Bronx, NY",0,4,1,2.0,4/22/2016,"Ridiculous service. How are there multiple empty tables and we still had to wait to be seated. Then the host states ""sorry I forgot we had these seats."" Thankfully they invested in the table assistance machine to take our appetizers order, because waiting for a server would be waiting for ice to melt.  Did not know to get an order of lemon water takes more than 10 minutes and then they forget the lemon. Thankfully the food was good, with the exception of the chicken Quesadilla that took forever to come out.  I was able to place an order for dessert, pay for my bill and the sever still took forever to bring out a to go bag.  Overall this Applebee's needs to reset their workers to be more productive and efficient.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bronx-11?start=20
Ann W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,,1.0,10/23/2016,"It seems like service gets more horrible then the last. I went in to have some drinks at the bar, I was sitting there for 25 mins and no one bother to speak to me. No one bother to give me a menu, tell me to give them a sec to finish , they will be right with me nothing. Not even acknowledge me. 25 mins !!! I know it was busy I clearly can see one bartender busy making drinks but there was another lady behind the bar walking around doing little things. This isn't the first time this had happen to me. I came a couple of months ago and was sat at a table, and waited 30 mins for someone to come take my friend and my order. We would have been waiting more for a server if we didn't just grab someone who was just walking around. Fordham is a busy area, it seems they need a bit more staff. Very disappointed, I rather travel the distance and go to the one in 225.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bronx-11?start=20
Cameron G.,"Syosset, NY",143,40,11,1.0,2/26/2016,Food is what you expect from an Applebee's. I like the honey barbecue sauce on the wings and the mozzarella sticks but everything else is just okay. The portion sizes for the money aren't generous either. Service is slow no matter how crowded it is. I have had my order messed up several times here and on the simplest orders. It's really frustrating and I've told my friends I'm not going back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bronx-11?start=20

Briana T.,"Bronx, NY",0,6,,2.0,11/7/2016,Everytime I come I leave full but dissatisfied with the food. It honestly tastes like its microwaved or boxed food just being heated up and thrown on a plate. The plates you sometimes get with your food on it looks dirty . The servers are young chicks who are sometimes rude. They're not genuinely nice it's just for tip. If applebees had more better customer service and real hand made food it will definitly be a better experience .,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bronx-11?start=20
Victor S.,"Bronx, NY",265,69,7,1.0,1/11/2016,"Unfortunately my visit to this particular Applebee's sucked. YES I said sucked! I went here with my wife on Monday January 4th, 2015 during the day time and the place was practically empty - you would think that we are about to get exceptionally fast service..... NOT!!!  First things first the music that plays in the background was super loud - Headache Loud to be honest, who wants to hear super loud music while they eat in the middle of the day? Anyway we tried to put that to the side but after sitting there for 20 minutes without anyone acknowledging us my wife decided to bring it to the attention of the manager. It's not like the server did not see us sitting there  she only came to the table next to us 5 times and looked dead at us.... wtf is that? Once the manager reamed her out which was very obvious as he did it on the floor where everyone could see, she strolled over to tell us her name and that she would be serving us.... Like really we already know that bozo!!! At this point were 30 minutes into our visit, she finally takes our orders - we started with an order of mozzarella sticks for 2 followed by an order of riblets for my wife and a steak meal for myself.  DISAPPOINTED just isn't the word I would like to use at this point - we waited an addition 45 minutes for this food and it SUCKED as well. The riblets looked like a steak as they were 1 solid piece and her fries were overdone, my steak was bland and under cooked ( I asked for well done) my baked potato was hard like a rock and by the way - the mozzarella sticks had the flavor of frozen to them accompanied by a miserable tomato sauce. Dessert (chocolate Lava Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream) was about the only tasty thing we had but even that left a sour taste as we had to wait 25 more minutes just for that. - that's over1 1/2 hours to have a complete meal at a non crowded Applebee's. Felt  like no one really cared or wanted to work - even the greeter was horrible with her unwelcoming attitude. Do yourselves a favor and go to checkers across the street you may enjoy that better and for a lot less..... Never going back once is enough for us!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bronx-11?start=20
Angel M.,"Bronx, NY",0,4,,4.0,10/25/2016,"I visited this resturant around a month ago and once before then. In both occasions the service was great and the food better. I went with a friend and the food was delievered fast and our server checked up on us at a good rate. I had the chicken shrimp pasta and when i return in the future i dont plan on ordering anything but.  The lipton rasberry green tea (unsweet) was great and refreshing. If i didnt already state it, the food was amazing.

Michele R.,"Bronx, NY",17,72,166,1.0,9/21/2015,Horrible service & wait time.  The evening manager is rude and spends most of his time surrounding himself around the young female staff.  The promotions are not displayed so make sure you ask about them before you order. The drinks are very watered down and take long to be delivered to your table.  They run out of certain appetizers during the peak time and wait to tell you after they bring you your other items.  Waiters do not come directly to you at times unless you stand up and grab their attention.  It is in a great location so its sad that service sucks and food is not that great.  Like others noted sometimes the food taste like it was warmed up in the microwave. Its an okay spot if you only want to grab a snack and a beverage and chat with a good friend.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bronx-11?start=20
Amanda A.,"Bronx, NY",0,19,36,1.0,2/20/2016,"If I could give this experience 0 stars I would. We took my sister out to celebrate her getting her bartending license. And we regret coming here. First all we waited 25 for our drinks and WATER and for waitress take our order. The waiters did not know the table numbers and kept getting food confused. My mom ordered a sandwich with fries and specifically told them NO SALT AND PEPPER! Of course it comes with both! My mom got her entree first while my husband and I waited 20 more minutes for ours. I could have sworn all food comes together? Finally when i get my food, its the WRONG type of pasta! I had that dish many times I know what its supposed to look like. My sister ordered a drink and it was horrible. The other waitress gave us an attitude about ordering drinks.  To put the cherry on top: we were there for 1 hr and 30 mins waiting for everything while a table right behind us got all of their food and drinks and checks in 30 mins.  Speaking of the checks, we waited another 20 minutes to get our check to the point we could have walked out cuz no one checked on us. Our waitress was NEVER around! So my mom went downstairs (we were seated upstairs) and told someone about our check. The other waiters were like ""you could've paid with the little computer on the table"" again NO ONE told us about it! NEVER coming back here again! I would've got better service at the Checkers across the street! I don't know why I even paid for my meal!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bronx-11?start=20
