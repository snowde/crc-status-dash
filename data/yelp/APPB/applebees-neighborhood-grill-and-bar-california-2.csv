Keri C.,"San Antonio, TX",23,39,5,3.0,8/9/2012,"I am never a huge fan of these chain restaurants... and typically have low expectations when we go. I was pleasantly surprised by the service and the food. We ordered the 2 for 20 deal... the food was satisfactory... in fact, my chicken was cooked very well... moist and tender, and quite flavorful. We felt we got the most bang for our buck and will likely visit again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-california-2?start=20
Luke W.,"Lusby, MD",0,1,,1.0,2/9/2015,"There are few times in life when you get to pay for such unabashed idiocy. Let me preface the following by saying I entered this applebees with the sole intention of giving it one final shot. This will explain my attention to the horrifyingly bad service. I walked into the resteraunt at 12:50pm on this monday afternoon. I immediately sat at the bar area and greeted the bartender. She courtiously turned checked her phone and continued to talk to the other waitress for ten mins without asking if I would like something. At this I order an ice tea unsweetened with lemon and she tells me, ""oh great now I have a reason to go into the kitchen."" She returns of course with an ice tea unsweet no lemon. I ask her for one and she say in my house there is no lemon and grabs one with her bare hands that had just thrown the bar towel down and tosses it in my cup. It is now 1:15. She runs off as I sit there trying to figure out what to do with this tea and doesnt return till 1:25. Finally I get tired of listening to the manager speak about planet of the apes to a customer at the bar and ask if I can have a menu. She agrees hands me a menu and off she goes again. Comes back when I am burning a hole in the side of her head from my gaze and takes my order. Burbon street steak medium rare. It is now 1:35. I complain a bit that the service around the area ""town"" is lacking and she agrees that it is, aparently not putting together I was speaking of her in a round about way. I recieve my steak at 1:50 an hour after I arrived. The steak was probably the most chewy cut of steak I have had in my life. I ask for the manager and he proceeds to ask if its cooked correctly or just chewy. This confirmes my suspicions that this has been an issue so I tell him just chewy and he says there is nothing he can do about chewy steaks. At this point I'm so hungry I dont care and power through the meal while the bartender tells me how it must be so hard in the area being single since she noticed I don't have a ring. This is followed by her stating that she is glad she could find someone who loves her. So at the end of this long drawn out story I have been fed pig swill, overcharged for it, told I have no one who loves me, and the service was horrible all in front of the manager talking about a movie not doing his job with a resteraunt that had 10 tables filled. Bravo Bravo!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-california-2?start=20
Amy S.,"Lusby, MD",36,9,3,1.0,1/23/2011,"The best thing I can say about this place is the service was not horrible. The food was, however. Chain restaurants are the norm in this area, to my chagrin. It had been over a year since I walked through their doors but I decided to give it another try. I tried one of the newer menu items, the cheese stuffed meatballs. Strange to say the least. The pasta was clumped together with a thick flavorless white sauce but the meatballs on top were covered in a mediocre red sauce. I won't be returning anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-california-2?start=20
S H.,"Lexington Park, MD",0,1,,5.0,7/26/2013,"5 stars for a great staff that served our family 3 minutes before closing.  We had just returned from trip to the other coast.  The hostess checked with the kitchen staff before seating us to be sure food was still available.  Then she and the bartender made sure we got our dinners and drinks quickly.  When they explained that the fryer had been turned off for the night, we were offered salad as our side dish instead of fries.  Huge and fresh.  We were made to feel welcome and not rushed.  Thanks to the Applebee's staff for great service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-california-2?start=20
Graeme H.,"Washington, DC",1,6,,4.0,11/17/2010,"Bartender was very attentive. Food was better than average for an Applebees. Decent music. Only complaint is that TV's are difficult to see while sitting at the bar. That's usually one of the main attractions to sitting at the bar. One other plus, they serve Heineken in the big cans which is almost impossible to find at bars/restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-california-2?start=20
Virginia R.,"Leonardtown, MD",14,10,,5.0,11/8/2017,Food was excellent. Server was attentive and the environment was a nice bar and grill. VERY GROWN up.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-california-2
Tennay D.,"Lexington Park, MD",0,51,7,5.0,12/5/2017,"It's Applebee's so I'm not sure what we should've expected but one store I guess is good because I would've given it zero if I could've. Bad service slow service no service. That's what we got no silverware late food, didn't even get all the food on the plate they said they will bring the rest out later. Skip this place pay the extra money go somewhere else",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-california-2
Scott S.,"California, MD",10,30,1,4.0,9/3/2017,"Applebee's used to be the butt of many jokes. For years I've referred to it as Crapplebee's and thought of it as a symbol of everything wrong with American food culture. It was unoriginal and unhealthy...with menu items that were devised to bomb your gut. Something has changed in the past decade since my last trip. Something good. I have to admit, I thought it was a fluke at first, but I went a second time. This last trip I got the Nashville hot chicken sandwich which was tender, perfectly spicy, and pleasantly crispy. It lacked salt but that's what the salt shaker is for. My wife got the cedar grilled lemon chicken and she loved it. I had a bite and it was very tender and full of flavor. The only downside to my latest visit was that patrons at the bar were very loud, so much so it was hard to hold a conversation unless I yelled.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-california-2
Pablo N.,"Livermore, CA",0,8,,5.0,11/11/2017,Excellent service- very friendly and courteous staff especially the young lady at the bar counter. She Is a very happy person. Glad to dine here and enjoy a pleasant conversation.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-california-2
Derek N.,"California, MD",7,3,1,1.0,3/2/2017,The food is terrible. Think frozen appetizers cooked in an oven/microwave and the left out until they were back to room temp.  Happy hour deals and service are good but the cook staff give Zero f&@ks. Normally Applebees makes a good lunch or happy hour stop but this place is a disgrace.   Even the chips and salsa appetizer sucked. Really? If you are looking for more than drinks you will probably be disappointed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-california-2
Frankie R.,"Lexington Park, MD",68,31,1,1.0,6/3/2017,Well I would write a full review but I don't have anything to base it off of. We were seated and sat there for 15 minutes without being approached even for our drink order. Had numerous waitresses walk past us without saying a word. The lady we thought would be our server walked by at least 3 times to help the tables around us but didn't say a word to us. I guess someone else wants my business tonight because we left. Good luck not starving to death while waiting to get served.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-california-2
John O.,"Lusby, MD",11,60,10,1.0,7/11/2016,"With all the recent changes that Applebee's has made, they seemed to be heading in the right direction.  I have gone there several times in the past few months, and was pleasantly surprised with the new food options.  However, today was a totally different story. My wife and I stopped in for lunch today.  The place was not very busy at all.  There were about 10-12 other tables with people there, so I figured it would be a fairly quick lunch.  Not so fast. !!! let's start with our waitress, Jessie.  I don't think you could have had a more apathetic server if you tried.  We saw her when she got our drink, or food, and our receipt.  Basically, we rarely saw her.  Whether it was to ask for another drink, or an update on when our food would be ready, she was nowhere to be found.  But lets just leave this where it is, not so good. Now the food.......  I ordered the southwest steak salad with the steak cooked rare.  What I got was a sad looking hunk of meat, with little to no char or cook marks on it, that looked like it was cooked slowly in a frying pan.  But the worst part, was that the steak was COLD when I got it.  Could I have sent it back, yes.... but I rarely do that for several reasons.  One, it took 40 minutes to get the food in the first place, and I didn't want a reheated ""steak"".  The other one is because my lunch hour was about up, and I didn't know how long it would take to get a hot steak cooked right.  So I just ate it and moved on. As far as the restaurant itself goes, it could have been better.  I was dodging flies for about 20 minutes as they dive bombed my table.  In addition, the speaker directly over our head played as much static as it did music....  Very annoying. I have to admit, I was very disappointed with Applebee's this time around.  Not sure how often I'll be back. Either way, take this review for what it's worth.....  not much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-california-2
Gail R.,"Olney, MD",105,303,3089,3.0,5/1/2014,"It has been a long while since I went to an Applebee's, but went along with friends after attending an annual festival in the area. At the time we got there was late at night. On this visit, we spent more time chatting than eating, because we were all full at the time. However, I did get a chance to taste their Chocolate Mousse Dessert Shooter. It had decadent Oreo cookie pieces, chocolate mousse, hot fudge and whipped cream ($2.29). If you like mousse it is great for you, but don't expect cake at the bottom, as I did because at the time I ordered I did not fully read the description. It was very creamy and rich and so I only ate half, which is not a whole lot considering it is in a shooter glass. Our waitress on this visit was Constance and she was very bubbly and pleasant. She told us about checking out the place on Sat and we did. So, on my second visit to this location, this time I decided to eat something, nothing big (plus we had a different waiter than the previous night). I ordered the Quesadilla Burger, topped with their signature Mexi-ranch sauce and sprinkled with crisp bacon pieces, freshly-made pico de gallo and shredded lettuce and packed into a Jack and cheddar quesadilla ($9.99). Picture ground beef in a pita bread and it came with fries. It was okay - I did not get a wow factor as I ate it. If I am in the area again, I will certainly come back, but mostly to have Constance as my waitress only.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-california-2
Anna C.,"Great Mills, MD",59,11,1,1.0,6/21/2016,"This Applebees location is absolutely terrible. From the building itself, to the food and all the way down to the servers. There was no host to seat us, so we stood at the front for 5minutes. Once finally getting a table, it was an additional 5 minutes before we saw a server. Once we got our order- my wings were dry and sauce less. My oriental chicken salad was suppose to have ""mixed Asian greens"" but was cheap iceberg lettuce with shredded carrots and radishes- like out of a cheap bagged salad. DISGUSTING. On top of that- we had no silver wear and had to ask another server for some. There was some type of miscommunication with our sever and the other server- and we didn't get our silver wear for 10 minutes. Save yourself time and money and DON'T GO HERE!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-california-2

Wayne L.,"Hampton, VA",0,5,1,2.0,12/27/2016,had lunch at Applebee's yesterday.. appetizer chips where soggy.  the main meal..I had the rib nibblets with French fries.  the fries tasted like they where made the day before.

Jonas S.,"Great Mills, MD",6,64,82,2.0,10/3/2014,"Usual chain, busy at dinner, weird ""section"" cut-offs that put us in our ""NEW"" waitress ""blind-spot""(?).  Took 20 mins before our drink order was taken; rushed off and we were ready to order food by then-so another wait. Dropped off the drinks and ran off again-WITHOUT OUR FOOD ORDER-again.  Once she came back the THIRD TIME, she had to come back a FOURTH TIME, to verify my sides, which are standard and not 'choices'. Food is mediocre, started off on a bad note with a HUGE delay in service-maybe I should submit this review later if my mood improves...because it seems this place will make no attempt to improve my mood, unless ACCIDENTALLY. Applebee's on Miramar Way deserves one star, but I gave it a second star only because we used a $25 gift card and the meal seemed a better deal-everything considered.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-california-2
B M.,"Hollywood, MD",0,67,20,1.0,6/29/2016,"Just not good.  I was excited to see the new menu at Applebee's, several things sounded good.  I ordered the Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp and it was extremely disappointing for $14.99.  Everything seemed to be precooked (like that morning) and just thrown on the platter at the last minute.  The chicken seemed to be a frozen chicken breast with fake grill marks (exactly like something you would get in a McDonalds sandwich), the 6 tiny shrimp were overcooked and dry, as were the completely unseasoned potatoes.  Everything was dry and then they just threw a pat of seasoned butter on the chicken - it was still there melting on the chicken like crappy IHOP pancakes. My husband fish and chips was undercooked, with some cold fish - yuck! My kids had fried shrimp which was overcooked and was 75% breading. The booth we say in was uncomfortable.  The booth was square with rounded corners, but the table was a circle, so anyone in the corner seats had to turn and sit at an angle to eat at the table.  The table itself was sticky.  After asking the waiter to wipe it off we realized all the finish was wore of the table.  That means everyone else's previous meals were soaked into the wood and it is permanently sticking.  ...The ketchup was empty ...the table tent menus were sticky and had a smear of bbq sauce on it.  The whole experience was just gross.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-california-2
Chris M.,"Lexington Park, MD",17,65,27,1.0,9/24/2015,"Walking in it took a few minutes to be greeted.  Guess no one wanted to tend to another table.  I was ordering take away.  A few a couple of waitresses looked in my direction but, ignored me a third waitress saw me and greeted me offered her assistance and lead me in the right direction to place an order.  Finally, I just may get something to eat! Ironically one of the waitresses who ignored me took my order.  I started not to tip her but, two wrongs do not make a right.  Not sure if o would order another burger from here.  They only give you two choices...pink or no pink and they must mash them down as they cook.  The burger was very dry and not good eats in any shape or form.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-california-2
Taylor A.,"Lexington Park, MD",1,15,,3.0,2/17/2015,"In a town that basically only has chain restraunts, Applebee's is normally the best option. Decent food, cheap drinks. I've given this particular Bees about 3 different visits. The bartender, Anna, was very nice and attentive. Only compliments for her, perhaps why I'm giving a 3 star review. The problem is that, every time I've been there and sat at the bar, a very strong smell of 'old moldy unclean kitchen' overwhelms my experience. The last time I went there was the last straw. The smell was way more intense than usual, and then when my sandwich came out, the smell of the kitchen was infused in the bread! It literally made me sick to my stomach. I couldn't stay in there a second longer. Got my check, and left. I had plans to go out with friends after that. I felt like I now smelled like old moldy dirty kitchen. I had to go to the Walmart next door and buy cheap cologne to help mask it. Clean it up Applebee's! When you do let me know and I'll come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-california-2
Brittney P.,"Great Mills, MD",0,1,,1.0,3/22/2015,"I decided to order Carside To Go from Applebee's on my way home from work. On a Sunday night I expected them to be busy so I wasn't surprised when my order didn't come out on time. But after 20 minutes past pick-up time, I called the store. They finally brought out my food, claiming they didn't see my car on the camera. I was parked right in the Carside To Go parking space and if you really didn't see me, why would you not call me to make sure I was still picking up my order? And then once I got home, I found that they did not even give me my two sides. I paid extra for a salad because on their online order site they do not give you the option of a salad as a side. I ended up paying $20 for a side salad and a cold steak. I chose ordering from Applebee's because I wanted to pick up something quick for dinner after work and I did not want fast food. I was very disappointed and I honestly would have been better off going to a drive thru.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-california-2
Jason W.,"Leonardtown, MD",52,20,5,3.0,2/7/2014,"Applebees is basic in all respects. They currently have a 5.99 all you can eat soup, salad & bread.  It's great provided you have tons of time to wait for another round of soup.  The long wait for food during a period of light patronage and the fact it took ""forever"" to get our check earns Applebees three stars in my opinion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-california-2
Michael G.,"Lexington Park, MD",30,128,106,1.0,2/24/2015,"It was painful!!!!  To the point... Our service was below average. It seemed like it took a good 30-40 minutes for our order to get to the table. ( Then I wished that I would of went to 5 guys as planned ) Not a fancy order, just a burger and 3 appetizers total.  The nachos were drenched with a soupy topping and the Kobe meatballs were nothing special at all.  My fries tasted like they were reheated or cooked in cold oil and the Cowboy burger was just good enough to eat. We didn't see much of our server, my glass emptied the second time and was left empty for the rest of the visit.  I complained about my fries to the server and he didnt have any suprise, like hes heard it before and quickly had a comment to seperate himself from the kitchen. It took 15 minutes for the manager to come to the table,,, and I never cought his name. The manager asked me if I wanted new fries,,, umm  NO! he didn't notice we were finished eating. He also explained to me that ""the fries are NEVER reheated and the come out every 4 minutes"". If I had my BS flag, I would of thrown it at his face but I just wanted to get the hell out of there because we were pushing 2 hours and I had stuff to do.  I don't think I will return unless someone is begging me to go and they are paying.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-california-2
