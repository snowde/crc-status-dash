Thomas E M.,"Gardnerville, NV",214,430,2303,4.0,12/13/2010,"For what it is, this is not a bad stop.  The food was good. My wife and I were both able to select items that were advertised at being less than 550 calories. I had a sirloin steak, with shrimp and a semi-spicy sauce. I had them hold the potatoes and requested extra veggies. They did this, and I enjoyed the flavors. My wife had a chicken dish prepared much the same way, and she enjoyed it.  Don't get me wrong, this is not fine dining. It was a Sunday night, after he prime dinner hour, and we were hungry.  We had a great server. Her name was Joyce, and she was very pleasant and easy to work with. The manager even came by at one point during our meal to see how everything was going.  We would probably come back, and that's the bottom line. A relatively healthy dinner for two at about $24.00",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carson-city-3?start=40
Alexys S.,"South Lake Tahoe, CA",49,16,29,1.0,4/18/2014,I'm giving this place a single start because I have to or I would give this place a negative two stars food was good server was supper rude her name is Debbie she was making rude comments as she would walk away from our table when she delivered our food she told us she had forgotten what we had ordered and then I asked her to cancel the chips and salas and as she walked away she said they are FREE anyways loud enough for me to hear her a few tables distance . Then I ordered a scoop of ice-cream and she was being loud about me ordering a scoop on the handheld computer out our table #14. While I was still having my ribs she came over and said need a box and asked to take my plate away while i was having dinner. I will never come back to this place our hostess was really professional and polite. There's nothing or almost anything this place to get me to come back unless Debbie isn't around.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carson-city-3?start=40
Donna W.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",2,164,121,2.0,10/1/2012,"We hit this Applebees coming and going on our trip. The first time we went we were oh so tired after a long day driving. Honestly it was not our first choice but Olive Garden had 60+ minute wait, so Applebees got our vote. We had a lovely server, but unfortunately several things we ordered they had ""run out of"", including baked potatos.    The food was adequate and our server was pleasant. Sooooo on our return trip, rather then look for somewhere else to eat after another long day driving we went back. We had what was a new server.  Honestly after a long days drive I am not wanting to train their new employees.  I asked for a veggie burger, to which she promptly told me they did not have them.  Really.  I said how about you go ask  (since they say they have them in little print on the menu) imagine her surprise when she told me they did have them. I ordered a dinner salad as well, you know something that should come before your meal. Whoops she forgot it when she brought all the food.  Whoops she messed up my order also.   I will say the manager did come by and she did take my salad off the check- oh wait I never got it-  and then my veggie burger.  I would have rather had a hassle free dinner and paid my $7. At least this time they were not out of everything.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carson-city-3?start=40
Alex R.,"Reno, NV",8,10,1,5.0,11/20/2014,Go to Applebee's for late dinners - one of the few restaurants in Carson City which open late. Food is OK. Clean and friendly.

Brook M.,"Carson City, NV",0,34,,2.0,7/31/2012,"This place to me is comparable with Chilis, except I would probably say Applebees isn't as good as Chili's. It has the same goofy atmosphere and the service is so/so. The food isn't that great but I wouldn't say its terrible.  *Don't order the tomato soup it tasted like weird spaghetti sauce in a cup.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carson-city-3?start=40
Katy E.,"Carson City, NV",3,103,1,1.0,6/3/2011,"I don't have a ""three strike rule"", only two.  I moved to Carson four years ago and tried this Applebee's twice since then - and I'm NEVER going back. Both time there were rocks in my mashed potatoes.  I don't even remember how any other part of either meal was other than the ROCKS IN MY MASHED POTATOES!!!  I'm not talking gritty, unclean potatoes.  I mean rocks, over a millimeter each.  Gravel might be a more descriptive word, to give you an idea. The first time I went, I pointed it out and my meal was free.  Okay, that works I guess but I really wanted mashed potatoes.   The second time I went, I figured that one time was a fluke and I'd try again.  NOPE!  Same thing - rocks in my mashed potatoes!!  It had been well over a year between my Applebee's attempts and THE SAME ISSUE!  When I pointed it our to the waitress, she actually stuck her finger in my mashed potatoes, stirred it around and said 'Oh yeah, huh!'.  She didn't offer me another plate or anything - not that this was my wish but COME ON! I haven't been back and won't.  If a restaurant has employees willing to dig around in my food for ROCKS, I certainly can't expect them to handle my dental bills when I crack my teeth.

Dick G.,"Dayton, NV",11,85,,1.0,10/5/2011,"The drinks, wine and fancy margaritas were too expensive. Waiter suggested them...no mention of price. Soup was cold, salad was tasteless.

Jessica H.,"Carson City, NV",3,4,1,1.0,9/13/2012,"This place is awful!  Went here tonight with my boyfriend his little brother and his girlfriend. We were sat right away. Then downhill from there. My boyfriend ordered a beer the waitress checked his ID then sent the bartender over to recheck it because she didn't know if it was okay to give him a beer or not. Next we sat there for an hour and a half waiting for our food. (It wasn't even busy) Finally after the food arrived by a different waitress everybody was starving. I ordered the fish and chips. One piece of fish was hot while the others were cold and the ""chips"" were cold as if they had been sitting under a heat lamp for the last hour. My boyfriends steak was bleeding all over his plate. His little brothers girlfriends food was completely cold all the way around. His little brother ordered the steak fajitas which was the only hot food but considering it comes on a ""sizzling platter"" it was nearly impossible for it to be cold.  When informing the waitress that the fries were cold as well as the whole other dish she took one dish back while the fries were cooked then brought it back. The whole dish looked as if it was put in the microwave while it waited for the fries to come out.  After finishing what we could of the disgusting food we sat for another 25 minutes waiting for a waitress to come into sight so we could ask for the check. The waitress stopped at the table asked if we wanted dessert after telling her ""no thank you"" she proceeded to walk away having to ask her for the check as she walked off she turns around and says ""Ya I'm getting it"" in the rudest tone ever.  10 minutes later we receive the check 74.06 for awful food and horrible service. Definitely will NOT be returning to this establishment and will NEVER recommend this place to anybody.  I'd much rather go to Chilli's. At least the food is better and the service is MUCH nicer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carson-city-3?start=40

Diana G.,"Susanville, CA",0,20,3,2.0,7/26/2014,Really mediocre meal.  Had the sirloin steak.  Requested medium rare. It was cut unevenly and one side was rare and other side was well done.  But steak had absolutely no flavor.  My husband had some sort of Asian shrimp salad.  It was tasty enough but came in a huge bowl but hardly any salad.  Come on lettuce is cheap.  We won't be coming back here.  I hate it when restaurants don't put prices on menu for drinks.  Of course the waitress didn't know the prices.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carson-city-3?start=40

My kids ordered the ribs and the ribs where like jurkey and hardly any meat on the bone, then we told our server ( 15 min to flag her down) and she got them more ribs and they where just as bad! My husband ordered the sirloin and it was dry and chewy. Our server was hard to find and never refilled our drinks. The manager never came over to see why we where unhappy.

One thing that bugs us: the servers seemed to be forced to offer constant recommendations....about 5-6 per meal.

My son had a combo for $9.....chose black bean soup and the cheeseburger egg rolls. Just okay and the soup was solid with no liquid.??

Shere B.,"Seattle, WA",91,67,96,1.0,8/15/2017,"Oh Applebee's. I'm so disappointed in you. The experience this even has been horrible.  To the point that I'm physically sick. First, as I'm walking to the bathroom, I almost slipped and fell. I literally was waiting to fall backwards flailing my arms around and smack! My head hits the tile floor.   Luckily I have great balancing skills which allowed me to stay on my feet. Lol! Second, as my partner is opening up her menu, she starts to get this odd look on her face. She opens up the menu and (no joke) there were nose (?) hairs/clippings. There were so many. We called our server and she was even grossed out by it. So the manger came over to check on the tables and we informed him of what happened. He said he was sorry and explained that the servers clean the dessert menu thoroughly but not the main menus. He did comp the dinner, which was very nice.

Andrew S.,"Santa Barbara, CA",5,4,3,2.0,11/16/2016,"Beer was cold so that was good. Mozzarella sticks were more ooie then gooie but hey let's not forget what I am here for. The salt and pepper grinders.  Brand: McCormicks. Same grinder style that one could pick up at your local Kroger brand store :)   NSF approved? I think not. In a world where everyone is so conscious of political correctness it's nice to see something against the grain. Applebees taking a risk and doing what they want how they want not giving a shoot. Service is about what you expect, adequate, been here for 30 min and still waiting for a smile. Our waitress I formed us that they have gift cards. (A promotion Applebee's implied: if there is a failure to suggest a gift card you get free ooie mozzarella sticks) she said if she didn't say something she would lose her job. What a thrill. Tomato Basil soup and and Fajita roll up. Chicken Fajita roll up excuse me. It's what's for dinner. First sip of soup, the kind of warm of soup you would serve your grandmother. Your grandmother who has ms and can't hold onto her spoon so well so you only make it semi warm so if she spills on herself it won't burn her. By the last bite my soup was cold. Salad croutons, I would say, classy touch. Check arrived, assuming I didn't want another beer to wash down my feelings of regret. (Check was wrong btw) Chicken fajita time. Uhh where is the sizzle? Why does it taste like Taco Bell? Why does it come with authentic thousand island dipping sauce? And why have I not gotten a new napkin yet?  Turns out I ordered the wrap which comes pre wrapped so... no sizzle. I wonder if I'll have to visit the bathroom the same way in 25 min as I do when I I eat a beefy 5 layer. Thousand island is a traditional dipping sauce south of the Reo Grand turns out. Got my napkin after I asked, thank goodness. Paid my check via automated  Table tablet FlaCarte. Server told me to use it... she is a busy woman.

For appetizer we ordered boneless chicken wings with sweet Thai chili sauce. It was good sauce but not spicy at all or maybe not spicy for me as my husband says that I can drink fire lol The chicken cooked perfect, tender and the battered not too thick. I ordered a chicken lime, it came with rice and colorful tortilla strips. The chicken was perfect, seasoned nicely & the top with melted cheese. The rice was a bit bland but it was good if you put Cholula My husband ordered grilled chicken penne and again the chicken was perfect & the penne was good too plus the cream was creamy.

I prefer that over server taking your glass away and getting it mixed up with another person's drink.  I come here for lunch sometimes for business.

Tim A.,"Pollock Pines, CA",0,21,,2.0,3/13/2016,I ordered the brisket enchiladas for dinner and literally looked and tasted like a TV dinner.  Rice was almost rubbery like it was leftovers and nuked.  Guess I should have sticked with a simple burger!   Service was good so I put the two stars.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carson-city-3?start=20
Renee S.,"Carson City, NV",2,117,,2.0,8/15/2015,"It is what it is. Service was good though. Went there for fish and chips. Menu says hand dipped white fish deep fried, served with fries and coleslaw.  Ok, hand dipped by some food distributor , ie Syco , or American Foods, frozen fries and at least the cole slaw was fresh.  Not worth it. The redeeming factor is the service and cleanliness of the place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carson-city-3?start=20
Sybil B.,"Damascus, OR",0,2,,2.0,3/12/2016,When we arrived we were told there was a 10 minute wait even though there were at least a dozen empty tables.  The hostess explained they were letting the kitchen catch up.  I had to ask to be seated and spend the ten minutes in a booth rather than the entrance.  Bad form,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carson-city-3?start=20

Wayne D.,"Carson City, NV",0,717,163,2.0,1/31/2013,"I'm writing an update because we had lunch here instead of dinner, and Applebee's has unveiled a new electronic device which is destined to change forever the restaurant landscape. Yes, my friends, I'm talking about the Ziosk Electronic Waiter Replacer and Dining Experience Enhancer.  With this little baby, you can order any item on the menu by merely choosing them on the touch screen. You can even pay your bill. There's no reason to even HAVE a waitress unless it's to actually bring you your food, and I'm sure there's a drone they're working on for that. The Ziosk doesn't ask you if you want water fifteen times, (""Really? No water? C'mon!"") and it doesn't continually touch you when it talks to you, which is more than I can say for the waitress. It doesn't seem to screw up your order either.  Unfortunately, it doesn't do any of the cooking. But, you know, they whip it out pretty fast. Mediocre but adaquate food, served quickly-- thanks to the Ziosk D.E.E.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carson-city-3?start=20
Grace H.,"San Francisco, CA",3,24,,3.0,6/19/2015,"Our waitress, Chelsea, provided great service. It was also dog friendly at the beer garden area which was the most important criteria because it was so hot on our way to Tahoe and we couldn't leave them in the car.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carson-city-3?start=20
Sierra R.,"Silver Springs, NV",14,42,,1.0,1/18/2016,"VERY disappointed. Me and my boyfriend took my dad out last night for a sobriety dinner and the place was pretty busy. We were seated right away, and that was basically it. We didn't notice that however, the waitress hadn't even asked us about drinks. :/ The family that had just come in behind us was already getting their orders taken and had drinks on their table. My dad instantly stood up and went and complained to the first employee he saw, and finally a waitress came to our table and made a hasty apology and took our orders. We definitely did not leave a tip. On top of that, my dad ordered the All-In burger, which came out to be the size of a mcdonalds burger. With the fries being a not so generous helping either. Same with my boyfriend's meal was very small. The food also wasn't very good, I'd say pretty basic. Definitely will not return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carson-city-3?start=20
Neuy D.,"Chicago, IL",36,403,3,5.0,3/19/2012,"I've grown defensive of chains lately and find myself going to more just so I don't feel pretentious. I used to look down on them until I moved to Reno and started to miss all my chains back home. Just because I only wander into them a couple times a year doesn't mean they don't have their place.   Overall,this revisiting of chains has been a pleasant surprise. The service tends to  be better than in a lot of local places which for me is big part of my dining experience.    There is a reason there thousands of Applebee's. It's consistently good food  for cheap. There is the 2 for twenty deal. An appetizer and entree for 2 for 20. Also after 9PM, appetizers are half off.  The highlight,  they are open late. If you want dinner after 9PM and don't feel like wandering into a smoke filled casino, Applebees is your best bet.  We both ordered pasta dishes (I know right in an Applebees?) but were surprised. They were better than many of the Italian places in town.  Next week I'm going to Olive garden.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carson-city-3?start=20
Jessica B.,"Dayton, NV",0,11,,1.0,10/3/2014,"Horrible food! We went and my husband ordered shrimp and steak with some kind of sauce on the steak (as the menu stated) it came out and was the worst looking food ever the white sauce mixed with some tomatoes to make a disgusting looking mixture and then the steak was under cooked.  When we asked for the manager she did not apologize simply said it was made right and saw nothing wrong with it.  I wish I had taken pictures so you could see it.   Will not return here,  used to love this place but after the managers comments and the quality of all our food do not want to give them another chance.  Dennys has better steaks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carson-city-3?start=20
Kodi N Ash H.,"Dayton, NV",41,33,1,4.0,9/9/2015,Been here probably 100 times in the last 10 years. Food is almost always good as is the staff. Wait times are not very long. Restaurant is very clean. I will complain however they are constantly changing the menu and have the most odd bread choices on sandwiches.

Becki O.,"Carson City, NV",84,9,,4.0,6/22/2015,"The waitress, Janine, was friendly and efficient.  She kept our water glasses full and brought our food quickly.  They had a new menu since the last time I was here with a bunch of new items.  I got the cedar grilled lemon chicken which was very good and just the right size portion.  My mom got the Napa chicken portobello and she thought it was good.  She enjoyed it and liked that she had the calorie count of it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carson-city-3?start=20

Baker H.,"Santa Clara, CA",33,5,,5.0,12/28/2013,"At first, I was scared to visit this restaurant since it had 2 star rating only. But we still gave it a shot and I am glad we did. The food was very good. We tried the 2 for $20. For appetizer, we got wings with sweet and spicy sauce, BBQ sauce on the side. For entries, we ordered 7oz Steak (Fries and Mash Potatoes) and Chicken/Shrimp basket.  Our server was one of the best servers we ever had. We even called the manager and told her how great our experience was. The place was very relaxing, and they had nice music (not very loud). They had cool tablets on the table so our friend's kid was busy playing which made our meal far more enjoyable.  I highly recommend trying this restaurant. You won't regret it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carson-city-3?start=20
Colleen K.,"Carson City, NV",141,20,1,2.0,1/10/2016,My husband and I came here for dinner and we tried the new pub diet menu items. I got the cedar grilled salmon and he got the hot shot chicken. The pictures in the menu show a generous portion but when we got our meals I barely had a 4 ounce sliver of salmon with a few green and potatoes for $15.49 and my husband's plate had a dollop of mashed potatoes with a child size piece of chicken for $9.99. I also had a coupon for a birthday dessert so that was the only reason we came here and the picture in the email advertised a Browne bite with ice cream but what we got was a little scoop of ice cream with fudge. We felt like all the items we got was false advertising and left hungry for $49. The manager did give us a brownie bite and 10% off our check but not sure we will be coming back. If I wanted to pay top dollar for food it won't be Applebee's food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-carson-city-3?start=20

Grace J.,"Dayton, NV",5,2,,1.0,1/28/2015,"Ordered the Shrimp Parm Steak a couple years ago- melted in your mouth delicious. Had one about a year ago- it was tough. We ordered three of these last night and they were again an uneatable chunk of grizzle!  I wouldn't feed that steak to my dog! The waitress didn't even ask why I didn't eat it. We should have sent them back but didn't want to embarrass anyone. Not that the restaurant was crowded, I wonder why?
