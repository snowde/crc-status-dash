Eric S.,"Kissimmee, FL",104,63,23,3.0,3/15/2017,"I love applebees.. probably my favorite Bar and Grill. This place is an epic failure. Came for a typically quick meal. Over 90 minutes I was here. I ordered a salad, my wife a burger. We were basically ignored as customers.  Please do yourself a favor and go somewhere else unless you are here for half price appetizers and happy hour. I won't even bother going for that. One visit and I am not coming back.  The worst part, I can walk here from my home. I'll drive to the Applebee's by orange lake before I come here. I will be home faster even with the extra travel time.  Oh, and for the locals... no Cast or Celebration resident discount. Update  I returned to give this place another chance.  The service was slow, but not nearly as bad as last time. The prices were fair and the food was more than I expected. Courtney our waitress was friendly. Not the home run I was looking for but the place is heading in the right direction. I have upgraded my review from 1 star to 3.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-celebration-2
Sam L.,"Celebration, Orlando, FL",208,38,54,1.0,7/3/2017,"UPDATE:  This is an update to my previous review.   The regional manager reached out to me, and said that this situation would be addressed.  Hopefully sometime in the future I'll be able to return to this location and the experience will be better. ****************** PREVIOUS REVIEW (1 Star):  I understand that we're talking about Applebee's so I don't expect a 5 star dining experience, but at a minimum I'd like to have timely and attentive service.  I live 2 minutes from here, and can definitively say that I will not be returning. I had a very disappointing experience tonight and, while the manager made an attempt to fix the issue, we still felt like it was all very disingenuous. The staff seems to be checked out mentally, and couldn't care less if you're there or not. Waited nearly 15 minutes after being seated and still no server, had to ask a manager to send our server over.  When she arrived her response was ""I didn't see you sitting here...but I'm here now.""  The restaurant was not busy at all, so I was naturally surprised that she didn't see us sitting a few tables away while she was attending to the tables behind us.  Either way, didn't seem to bother her at all. We ordered a mix of appetizers and entrees and asked for them to come out together.  Appetizers were brought out, and the server said the other food was being plated and would be right out.  Waited about 10-15 minutes (food still hadn't come out). It's apparent either the server or the kitchen staff slipped up.  Since our server was nowhere to be found, we flagged down another server and asked to speak with the manager. We spoke with the GM and reached a resolution, but I really don't feel like anyone cared that this happened.  The explanation he gave (which stuck in my mind) was that ""these things happen, and unfortunately they happened to you tonight."" I've had good experiences at other Applebees locations in the past, but I won't be returning to one in the future.  Too many better options, especially in this area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-celebration-2
Nancee M.,"Kissimmee, FL",376,427,4815,5.0,12/23/2016,"Let's just start with our server Kelly is AWESOME!!! From the moment we sat down she was extremely attentive and made great suggestions off of the new menu from the last time we had been to an Applebees.  I have had some bad experiences in the past with slow service and this was from it. Our drinks came quickly as well as our appetizers of Spinach, artichoke dip and Sriracha Shrimp. The Dip was as good as I remembered and was really delicious when you ate it with a scoop of the salsa that also accompanied it. The Shrimp was a little sweet and a lot of spicy. I loved it! For my entree I ordered the All Day Brunch Burger. The perfect blend where breakfast and burger meet.  From beginning to end, we had a fantastic experience and I look forward at returning again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-celebration-2
Janice E.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",13,33,29,1.0,4/14/2017,"I came here on a Friday around 2pm and the place was relatively empty, but the service was soooooooo slow!!  We were seated outside and it took our server about 10 mins to even come and take our order. Once she took our order (which included an appetizer) she was gone for well over 20 mins. When she returned, she brought our entrees but no appetizer and we didn't have any utensils either. I had to remind her that we do need forks in order to eat and I also inquired about the appetizer. She responded ""oh yeah that should be right out"". I never heard of any place that serves your entree before your appetizer. Anyway 5 mins later she brought the appetizer.  THEN, 10 mins later she brings us the bill (which we did not ask for and we were still eating). She said ""I'm just leaving this here for whenever you guys are ready"". But then guess what, she never came back to our table EVER again. Not to refill water, not to check to see if we needed anything. What if I wanted to order dessert? Why would you give me the bill so quickly.  We tried to pay with card, but she literally never came back to our table so we had to pay cash. I will never be returning to this location ever again. Terrible service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-celebration-2
Christy T.,"Tampa, FL",65,69,21,5.0,3/3/2017,"I just love the Applebee's light menu, especially, the cedar grilled lemon chicken.  It is so tasty. It is served on a bed of quinoa and it topped with cranberries, celery and craisins.  And if you get it off the 2 for $20 and then you then it comes with a side salad. It is an excellent deal. We stopped at this Applebee's on our way home from Epcot and it was a great experience. Our waiter Jackson was awesome! He was very friendly and helpful. Also, he was totally on top of his game. Our beverages were never empty and he made sure that all of our food was made exactly how we wanted it.  The ambience at this place was pretty cool too. I highly recommend it. Pleasant way to end a great day at Epcot!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-celebration-2
Carole B.,"Mashpee, MA",0,8,,2.0,10/29/2017,"Very disappointed with the service at Celebration Applebee's. After our waiter took our order, we didn't see him again for a good 20 minutes. Asked another server for iced tea refill and butter. Ten minutes later, nothing. We flagged down the server who had dropped our food and asked her for a refill and butter. Another ten minutes passed and we've just gotten the butter for the now-cold baked potato and the refill. Food was really good; wait time for entrees wasn't bad. The service was just poor...we were definitely neglected.  The manager came to speak to us and described how we should have been served...he got no argument from us! Wanted to add, we were offered no compensation (discount, comped meal, free dessert) to make up for poor service. Oh, yes, the manager did offer another baked potato but we were finished eating and ready to leave. Apparently Applebee's Corp keeps a tight rein on everything. Hope they continue to have enough return customers to make their freakishly close monitoring pay off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-celebration-2
Joyce L.,"Celebration, FL",197,112,139,4.0,10/2/2016,Updated: adding 2 more stars for the customer service they quickly redid the order for us free of charge and a $5 gift certificate to come back.  The only reason they get 2 stars was how fast they got the food together. However the orders were not correct for the burger and somehow a very small cup of soup as a side add on is $5!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-celebration-2
Stephen O.,"Austin, TX",281,111,194,5.0,6/25/2016,"Located in the all-new Shoppes at Celebration Place, this Applebee's features a modern interior including outlets for charging at many of the tables, medium and dark wood accents, and 13+ televisions throughout the restaurant. The 2 for $20 and 2 for $25 menus offer some of the best values in dining out for two and the 14 beers on tap exceed what I would expect at most chain restaurants, which this does not feel like. Given that they've just opened this week, attention to detail and service quality are excellent. The wait staff was knowledgeable, flexible, and offered good recommendations based on our preferences. Looking forward to trying the outdoor seating when cooler temperatures return. Recommend giving this one a try, 5 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-celebration-2
Kalyan D.,"Orlando, FL",11,18,,1.0,9/17/2016,"I love going to Applebees but this particular branch (6290 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy) is so pathetic. Honestly AVOID this branch.  To begin with, the servers here are very inattentive. I'm surprised they work there yet they don't know what the specials are, they don't know what the menu prices are. Very sloppy service, too much wait time and if you're there by yourself, you'll probably never be attended. You'd see them spending too much time chit chatting rather than attending to customers. I would give them a zero out of 5 if I could. Avoid this branch, visit the other ones out there. The branch by the international drive is the best one by my experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-celebration-2
Kate W.,"Harrisonburg, VA",64,13,,2.0,9/30/2017,"I would like to preface this review by saying that no one really goes to Applebee's for a fine dining experience. However, at a table service restaurant, I do expect basic service, which this location failed to provide. We were seated in the bar area despite the fact that we wanted a table in the general seating area. Our waitress was polite, but after taking our drink order, disappeared for a while and did not come back to take our food order for quite some time. After about 25 minutes after placing our order, our appetizers arrived, but were incorrect. It took about 45 minutes for our waitress to come back and notice she never gave us silverware. We ordered margaritas at the start of the meal, but they did not arrive until after we had finished. We had the opportunity to review our service at the tabletop kiosk and I expressed my disappointment with the inattentiveness of our server and the lack of cleanliness in the restrooms. As we were preparing to leave, our waitress came up to our table after apparently seeing the review from the kiosk and said, ""I don't know what happened guys. I'm usually really fun. I guess come back and see us."" It was an awkward end to a subpar meal. As a local, I will not be returning. There are too many other places to eat in the Celebration area that provide better service and better food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-celebration-2
Cherie C.,"Celebration, FL",6,5,,1.0,6/4/2017,"Went out to enjoy a nice dinner with my in laws. We were barely greeted with a smile, but that interaction was possibly the best part of our dining experience. We were walked past FOUR filthy tables, not being attended to. The restaurant itself was not busy, with maybe about 7 tables seated. Our serve was not very personal and NOT available for the length of our meal. I had to ask two different people for a refill on my bone dry drink which took about 10 minutes. The food was OK at best, although you could tell the appetizer sampler has sat in the window for quite some time: the celery was shriveled and cooked and the sauces all had a hard layer on the surface. We were going to flag down the manager as he walked by, but he looked like he could not care any less about his role. Maybe he was having a bad day. As a local, we've decided we will not be coming back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-celebration-2
Evelyn P.,"Celebration, Orlando, FL",133,168,728,4.0,6/24/2016,"Nice atmosphere! Music was great, plenty of tv screens, the lighting makes a nice relaxing ambiance to catch up with friends while enjoying some appetizers and drinks.  Love the fact that it is in our little town.  We ordered the cheeseburger eggrolls which was a neat and flavorful concept.  The thai shrimp salad came with a decent amount of shrimps, almonds, edamame, and wonton crispy noodles.  I do recommend the sauce on the side.  Keep in mind, the salad has a kick to it.  The blackberry honey tea was good!  They brew their tea!  The only disappointment is that to play a game in Tom, it was $1.99 per game.  It is not unlimited (unlike Chilis if you were to switch games its free once you pay the 1.99).  It is a false 'unlimited' advertisement.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-celebration-2
Mike T.,"Tampa, FL",0,13,,5.0,10/14/2016,"This is a brand new franchise that opened up locally. So far, so good. There are generally a lot of people there at night, usually for the bar I'm guessing, so watch out. This is one of the nicer Applebee's I've been to. I've had good lunch and dinner experiences here. Especially compared to other Applebee's - which can honestly be pretty bad with bad owners (you can see just by searching Applebees). The person running this joint seems committed to it's success. Admittedly, my first takeout order was missing one thing (when this place first opened), but I'm willing to overlook it as the restaurant was brand new and so was the staff. Things have only gotten better since.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-celebration-2

Gordon H.,"Lancaster, PA",0,6,,5.0,6/18/2017,We were so thankful Applebee's was open late. Out flight from Pennsylvania got in late and we needed a place for a late night meal. Our server was patient and attentive. Our food was cooked well tasted good. There were five of us. The manager stoped by our table more than once to check on us. There was a small mistake with my son's meal but it was corrected quickly. We were very happy with our visit!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-celebration-2
Rey C.,"Tampa, FL",1,1,,1.0,5/27/2017,"Worst service in applebees history. Bar none. I'm a loyal applebees customer and usually get great service from their locations in Tampa. This location just outside Orlando was so awful words cannot describe. The waitress next to our table never acknowledged us. They kept is waiting for 40 minutes before bringing our drinks which we had to fight to get. The wait staff, a guy names Sterling and another guy with highlights in his hair, whose name I did not get, were running around the place playing with each other. Finally, the cook came out and took out order. Our food never came. We were just coming from one of the Disney parks. Our son was crying because he was starving and these punk college kids showed the utmost disrespect and disregard for applebees guests. We are definitely filing a major complain in the morning with their regional office. People like this have no business working here. We had to leave to get fast food because our food order was never even placed. I am so disgusted by this location's lack of customer service. The table behind us was filthy and the two immature boys, Sterling and the other guy, were complaining that they had to clean it. We were ignored, even after bringing it up to their attention 4 times. I hope Applebees reads this and fires the wait staff and hires wait staff that care about their customers.  As for us, we will never dine at this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-celebration-2

Second our food took FOREVER to come out. Third my food was burnt and cold (crazy right?). Fourth the waitress never refilled our drinks even after asking 3 times. I sent my food back and the manger refunded my money for my food...but never came over to apologize or ask what they could do to make it right.

Went in for a late night drink and appetizers and when greeted at the bar, we were told, no food can be order for 25 minutes, per the manager. Ok, that is strange, so we order a drink and wait, and wait and wait. Someone from the back of the restaurant came out and started to place orders, never once asking us. Finally the bartendar comes back and we ask to place an order. The order is placed and after waiting another 45 minutes, we just could not take it any longer. We ask to talk to the manger, nope. This is the worst applebees i have ever been to and I would not recommend this to anyone. Honestly eat ANYWHERE else.
