Lynn F.,"Fairfax, VA",388,253,1769,4.0,6/12/2017,"Usually, I'd rate this 3, but considering all the modifications they had to do for my family, it's a 4 star review!  So we come in a group of 5. We are all very tired and hungry. We have two senior citizens in the group and they were very accommodating. There were also some vegetarians in my group as well.  So we come in and get seated. Our server is a really nice guy and he tried very hard with our table! We were a hard table considering we had so many modifications. So it was difficult at first because there was no sandwich that was vegetarian and All the sandwiches were not worth it if you took away the meat. We were kind of annoyed that the server first told us it would be an upcharge... Thank goodness he went and talked with his manager and they were able to give us a great deal!!  I will give this place one thing, the manager and service definitely know good customer service. Even though the restaurant lost a tiny bit of money in giving my family a cheaper sandwich, it worked out better for them because we were much happier and we gave them a bigger tip. We will also come back!  So everyone orders and ofcourse, the orders get messed up a little bit. But it was fixed eventually... They again were very apologetic and kind to us.  I got the chicken tortilla soup and I really really liked it!! I was super surprised but it was fantastic!!! Everyone else enjoyed their meal and the onion rings are definitely worth it!! They give you such big portions!!  Only downside, they were a little slow, but it wasn't awful. And they made a few mistakes that really shouldn't have been made, that's why they get a 4 instead of a 5.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-charleston-10
Mitch H.,"Charleston, WV",80,10,,1.0,10/12/2016,I saw 3 of your employees playing cards in one of the booths on Xmas Eve last year! Very unprofessional!  I noticed that I partially started this review last year and forgot to finish it!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-charleston-10
June F.,"Germantown, MD",0,6,,1.0,9/14/2016,"Traveled with a friend from Washington Dc to work on my moms flood damaged home in Clendenin, WV. When we finished our day we drove to Corridor G to have a late dinner as there is nothing closer that was open. Upon driving around the area we choose to go to Applebee's partly due to the unlimited app special. First off, there is a reason why all other restaurants in the area were packed and they were not. B ecause we were extremely hungry after a 5 hour drive, and 5 hours of mucking out a house we just did not want to wait 30mins or more so we decided to give applebee's a try.  What a mistake, the place was very dark, the food was sub par. we both ordered the endless apps. mozz was cold, the dumplings were over cooked and cold. I could have done a better job. I then ordered the bbq chix flatbread - came out cold. I had to track down our waiter and have them redo the order. still not good.  My friend ordered the steak sandwich - came out was cold, the fries were cold and the sandwich was full of gristle. What a big dissapointment.  I go to the Applebee's in my area at least once a month and have never had such bad service and food. Asked to speak with manager and after 30 mins of waiting we left. Will NOT be back to this location ever - surprised they are still open.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-charleston-10
Whitney B.,"Bancroft, WV",38,84,111,1.0,6/20/2016,well valetines day 2014 was horrible. We were seated quickly and the meal tasted fine but we waited literally an hr to get our bill. my boyfriend wanted to leave and not pay and I said no because I'm a nice person but now I wished I had listened to him over an hr just to get the bill to leave was bad and wont go back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-charleston-10
Michelle M.,"Wellington, FL",48,235,332,1.0,8/6/2013,"I used to not dislike Applebee's, but after two bad experiences, both in West Virginia, I am writing off this chain for good. It's a shame, because their menu is a little more innovative than the standard chain, but the execution is awful.  First, the food. I ordered a grilled sandwich with roast beef, cheese, and bacon. It was cooked well enough, but it was so salty that I could barely eat it. I love salt, but this sandwich was ridiculous. I think they crusted it in salt, washed it off, salted it again, cooked it, and salted it one more time for good measure. It was just bad. The fries were fine, just your standard fries.  My son had the chicken tenders, which tasted okay, but the portion size was a little small. He isn't a huge eater, but I felt like it could have been larger. Oh, and the food took way too long to come out. Our orders were not that complicated.  As far as the service goes, it started out great. But towards the middle of the meal, our waiter just disappeared. I ordered a second beer, and watched how it sat on the bar for at least 5 minutes before he brought it to me. Sad, lonely, beer. Anyhow, there are way better choices out there, don't waste your time on this hot mess.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-charleston-10
Debbie M.,"Newburgh, IN",11,81,164,3.0,7/11/2014,"This Applebee's was located close to my hotel which is why I chose it.  I was seated very quickly, but it took the server a while to show up.  They were not busy.  I ordered the new option to pick 2 for dinner.  I chose the steak with  Vidalia onion and shrimp scampi. The steak had good flavor, but was way over cooked.  The scampi had zucchini that was so hard I couldn't pick it up with my fork.  I doubt I would give this location another try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-charleston-10
Rick P.,"Liverpool, NY",3,26,,1.0,2/26/2015,"This place has went to crap, two months ago this was a good place to eat, good food, good staff. I went there last night for potato twisters and was disappointed that the entire menu had changed. Wait staff didn't appear to have a clue,  I ordered the pot stickers and they were over cooked and the shrimp in them smelled bad. 20 minutes later after complaining they brought out the second appetizer we had ordered with the first.  Our waiter passed our table at least 5 times with no ""do you need drinks? ""your food is coming"" ""I am sorry"" nothing. I ordered the cowboy burger, it wasn't put together, like it had just been thrown on the plate, and had virtually no sauce on it. The wife got an oriental chicken salad, and was one of the smallest salads i had ever seen. The table across from us had a regular side salad and it was bigger. Normally a manager would come by and ask if everything is ok. NOPE not a manager in sight. There were 4 other tables around us who had issues as well and no management in sight. WONT BE BACK",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-charleston-10
Tara A.,"Alum Creek, WV",6,11,110,3.0,4/9/2014,We have stayed away from this particular applebees for a while because service used to be really really really slow. We started coming back recently and was pleasantly surprised at how the service has improved. The 2 for 20 menu is good and they have $1 brownie desserts. Boneless wing appetizer is one of our favorites.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-charleston-10
Jackie P.,"Columbus, OH",146,191,30,1.0,8/24/2011,"Gross, gross, double icky, blah. I'm not quite sure if there are many Yelpers in Charleston, but if you happen to read this...please don't bother stopping here. If you want the same kind of food, make your way across the street to O'Charleys, atleast there you get rolls. Now, Applebees in itself isn't a restaurant I'm a fan of. I don't tend to frequent massive chains unless the food is something I crave. However, this establishment was just horrid. It took ages to get our food out, and let's just discuss what came out when it finally did: I visited here with my best friend and her mother, and we both ordered the Veggie Pizza (appetizer section) and her mom ordered the steak. Veggie Pizza: A soupy, goopy mess! YUCK!! STAY FAR AWAY! You couldn't even eat it without a spoon. It was horrendous. The manager came out after clearly noticing we didn't like it, and explained that because it is made on a flour tortilla, rather than actual crust, it turns out like that. Really? How can this even be on the menu? Let alone as something to share as an appetizer. You couldn't even cut or hold the thing! It literally had to be eaten like icecream! IT'S PIZZA, for Christ's sake! Steak, mashed potatoes, Veggies: First of all, an additional 4.00 for a side salad? That's usually free with an entree. Her mom thought the food was actually good, until as soon as we exited the door. She proceeded to get sick before we even left the parking lot! Bad/old steak? Probably! Because she even gets it overly well done when cooked! They did remove the pizzas from our bill, which was gracious...but I will never be back to an Applebees again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-charleston-10
Ryan L.,"Charleston, WV",0,6,,5.0,9/28/2013,I have been going to this place a lot.  I have always enjoyed it and it has become my standby when I can't decide where to go.  The menu has great variety and I haven't had a badly cooked meal among all my visits.  This is lucky because no place is perfect and the fact that I mainly eat at the bar could contribute to this. I have found that eating at the bar seems to produce more prompt service no matter where you are.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-charleston-10
Jason C.,"Charleston, WV",183,79,2,2.0,12/18/2012,Typical Applebee's.  Nothing special or out of the ordinary with this restaurant to make it stand out among the other options available.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-charleston-10
Missy M.,"Charleston, WV",75,286,23,1.0,11/11/2011,"Truly, no stars.  I haven't been in years because the food - meh - and service - too slow with no appologies or explanation - drove me away.  I don't really like chains as a rule and this is a perfect example why I avoid them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-charleston-10
Ted B.,"Stone Mountain, GA",0,4,,1.0,5/23/2012,"Terrible restaurant. Very poor service. Food is OK. Place is not very clean. Seems poorly managed as staff seems harried and not very professional. If you like Applebee's menu and food, you'll at least enjoy the food if not the meal due to the general grungy feel and the poor and slow service",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-charleston-10
