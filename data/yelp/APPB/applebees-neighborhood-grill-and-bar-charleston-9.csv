Michaela M.,"Orlando, FL",94,1,1,5.0,7/23/2017,"Awesome service! We come in to see Ashley every weekend because she is so great. The food is the same as every Applebee's restaurant. There is a sirloin with a bacon beer cheese topper right now that my fiancé absolutely adores. But if for no other reason, come in and sit with Ashley P. She offers great service and makes the experience great for each and every table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-charleston-9
Hwal L.,"Roanoke, VA",25,418,1158,4.0,7/6/2017,"This was a fun visit at the best Applebee's we've been to! Firstly, there's the little Presto machine you see on every table, which you can use to order desserts, make a payment, and play games (we didn't, but you never know). The service staff was friendly and on point, and the nice buzz in the whole place combined with everything else kind of made up for the little dips in the food: ++ Cedar grilled lemon chicken: grilled, yes; lemon, I think so; cedar? I'm not sure. The only thing that let this down was the disappointingly dry chicken, and it really should not be. 3.5/5 Caprese mozzarella chicken: not quite the same as in the picture in the menu, but a good combination of tomato, red onion, mashed potatoes, and grilled chicken. Chicken was, again, dry, but definitely less dry than the above. 4/5 House salad with French dressing: we were given a choice of 3-4 dressing, and French was fine. Lettuce was crisp, chopped veggies tasted nice and fresh, and the croutons were surprisingly buttery and amazing. Not the freshest cherry tomatoes, but it's forgiven. 4.5/5 -- Caesar salad: the lumps of seasoning and dressing spoiled this otherwise good version of Caesar salad. We hope to never get this again. 2/5",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-charleston-9
Olen S.,"Sacramento, CA",111,36,129,4.0,9/30/2016,"Typical stuff with pretty typical service. Except that Marie behind the bar is awesome. Management is a joke. Who runs to the bank during a Friday lunch? But it's okay because the floor manager will hold things down, right? Naw, he spent most of the time I was there at a table chatting up his friend. All the while, servers were left without an expediter.  Marie stayed cool through the lack of support from management.  Small town behavior at what should be an island of consistency for travelers and locals alike.  Get it together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-charleston-9
Keith V.,"Hurricane, WV",60,13,7,5.0,1/6/2017,"Having the new $9.99 burger bundle with some colleagues today! Great atmosphere! Friendly staff, quick and efficient to get us in and out during our lunch break.  The Blazin' Texan burger is spicy and full of flavor!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-charleston-9
Rae E.,"Penn Center, Philadelphia, PA",0,30,,1.0,7/5/2017,"I find it hard to believe anyone would give more than 1star for this place. I'd give 0 ZERO if I could. Food horrible.. chicken tastes like its full of water, salt and chemicals. NOT REAL FOOD! Grilled chicken Caesar salad with FAKE chicken in large chunks, dressing in bottom of bowl, Lettuce barely  cut had to cut lettuce to eat. Hubbie left his food on plate. Daughter's hot food Cold. SERVICE HORRIBLE never checked bac until she removed our plates. Husband left tip anyway. I would not have.  PLace empty..we shlda left. I will NEVER go back! I had better last week at Wendy's for much less.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-charleston-9
Zac G.,"Greensboro, NC",92,237,148,1.0,5/28/2014,"This location is in dire need of better staff training, communication, and management. During a recent visit, I ordered a Thai Shrimp Salad and Shrimp Scampi lunch combo. The choices seemed appealing, and, at $8.99, represented a decent value. However, my *shrimp* salad arrived sans shrimp. Our apologetic server did bring them on a separate plate after the error was pointed out, and they were cooked nicely. My companion, in the meantime, inquired about the soup of the day and was told it was a chicken corn chowder. Thinking it a relatively healthy option, she ordered that, only to receive a cream of potato soup that had a few bits of corn and no chicken. The response from our server was that this *was* supposed to be a chicken corn chowder. Right. After being offered French Onion or Tomato Basil soup as alternatives, she ordered the Tomato Basil...only to receive the French Onion. Finally, this mix-up was corrected, and the resulting Tomato Basil soup tasted fine. It should be noted that this Applebees was far from busy during our visit. Managers and servers were observed standing around and chatting or idly playing with their phones. In other chains (Ruby Tuesday, Chili's, etc.), managers will at least walk the floor to see how patrons are faring. Not here. As a chain, Applebees typically rates higher than this (and the food at least is up to standards), and I have not experienced these issues at other locations. But to anyone traveling through Charleston, you'd do well to avoid this establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-charleston-9
Bruce K.,"Charlotte, NC",1416,8489,16617,4.0,11/14/2013,"Perfect chain Applebee's. If you've been to one, then you've been to this one. I had the quesadilla burger and while it was messy, it was delicious. They have wifi.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-charleston-9
Hannah H.,"Charleston, WV",115,3,,2.0,3/26/2016,"Went last night for dinner. Can't beat the price for the 1/2 priced apps, however the service at this location is not the best. The food runner brought our app with half the food hanging off the plate and so it was touching table. For our actual dinner, I ordered the fiesta chicken salad which came out on a plate rather than the bowl it's normally served in at other locations. So rather than a filling salad, it left a lot to be desired. Both my salad and my dates dinner came out without the proper sauces/dressings so we had to stare at our food for 5 minutes before actual eat.  Bottom line: average food, below average service",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-charleston-9
Nelson G.,"Charleston, WV",10,14,,1.0,4/25/2016,I should have turned around and left when they seated us at a table with silverware and trash in the floor around our table.  There was five of us and the waitress took forever just to get the drink order right.  About five minutes after everyone ordered their food the waitress returned to tell my daughters boyfriend he would have to order something else they were out of what he wanted So he reordered.  Twenty minutes later she returned to tell me they didn't have what I ordered. I asked why it took so long to tell me? I asked to see the manger. He came out and had no explanation for being out of items on the menu or why it took so long to tell me they were out of the item I wanted.  I reordered a new item and after everyone else was finished my order came out.  I started eating and when I put a fork of garlic mashed potatoes in my mouth something wasn't right. I pulled out a big long piece of plastic bag out of my mouth. I thought I was going to throw up. The waitress came over and I showed her what happened and asked to see the manager again. His name was Cedric he didn't come back over and said I didn't owe anything for the table.  I will not be back to this Applebee's again. This makes the second time this kind of crap has happened. I'm done,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-charleston-9
Serious C.,"Chesapeake, VA",1,33,26,2.0,3/22/2015,Today's visit....well the food was not bad. The waiter seemed uninterested in anything server-related. I think he may have zoned out while taking our order. He spent most of his time visiting/flirting with some blondes at the bar.  We just had to wait for him to remember that he had some diners to check on...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-charleston-9
Ernie M.,"Northville, MI",42,396,58,3.0,10/5/2012,The menu is the same throughout the country---which is good. I had the French Onion Soup and a great burger. My wife had the salmon. All was good and the service was good. When traveling I am always happy when I see an Applebees because I know I can get a good meal there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-charleston-9
Ron N.,"Savannah, GA",42,232,5,2.0,4/13/2014,O.K. It's been years since I went in to an Applebee's but we were traveling and it had a good location.  I ordered a Quesadilla burger that was not a great concept.  The sanwich was very messy and drippings were everywhere.  There were also a few inedible small pieces of something that were more than crunchy.  I did not bring it to anyone's attention.  Our party also ordered a  lime chicken with rice that was pretty good but I think it will be a few more years before I return to Applebee's,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-charleston-9
Eric S.,"Morgantown, WV",1,98,,1.0,11/11/2013,Very poor.  Wait staff was unfriendly and rushed me.  I ordered a burger and the waitress asked if I wanted any pink.  Considering it was applebees I chose to avoid the stomach distress and ordered no pink.  The burger arrived very pink in the middle.  Nearly medium rare...  I showed the waitress and she was not very apologetic.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-charleston-9
Doogan H.,"Charleston, WV",0,6,3,5.0,11/5/2013,Was working out of town. Sat at the bar and ordered the sirloin   Great as always.  Bar tender and staff very friendly.  I'll go back again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-charleston-9
Frank D.,"Columbus, OH",42,130,144,4.0,6/1/2010,"Always good to be in an Applebee's with Yuengling, WVU, and Steelers stuff.  On vacation this week so I surprised my parents with a visit.  Applebee's is Applebee's usullay cooler than necessary and the food is fairly good with enough choices.  This one specically always has had good service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-charleston-9
Carl M.,"South Land Park, Sacramento, CA",209,23,2,3.0,7/18/2009,"well it is an Applebees...so typical food at typicial prices...the wait staff was great and friendly, It had more good looking women here in one place than any other place i have been in WV....so i kinda liked that.
