Lori M.,"Sharpsburg, MD",20,14,2,1.0,8/23/2014,"Went for the all you can eat ribs . You better pack a pillow and blanket because you might want to take a nap in between the time it took for the ribs to come to the table. It was ridiculous. Don't advertise them if you can't serve them. By the time you put an order in and wait, you aren't hungry anymore, I think that is their plan. Will NOT be back.

Andrew H.,"Charles Town, WV",2,5,,1.0,4/9/2015,"I don't mind Applebee's every now and then but this location is awful. I've been three times, all three times my party was asked to wait ten or fifteen minutes to be seated despite the restaurant being nearly empty. All three times we were seated and waited fifteen minutes or more for drinks to come out. And all three times we, for one reason or another, had to wait over one hour from the time we arrived until our food was brought out. Not acceptable. To add insult to injury, not one time did everyone I was with get exactly what they ordered. All three times our order was wrong, and on all three occasions the bill was not correct either, and we either had to make a stink or just pay it to get out of there. Three times was enough for me to realize that is just business as usual at this location. I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-charlestown?start=20
Kevin K.,"Charles Town, WV",49,3,5,1.0,12/31/2014,"Worst food experience i've had in a long time.  I ordered the New York strip, medium and a salad and asked if they could put feta  cheese on my salad, which they said they didn't have. Now i was ok with that but when our server brought my steak to me it looked rubbery i guess is the best way to describe it....when i cut into it there was no pink center...it was gray...and obviously been laying jn the freezer for quite a while. I did not cause a scene but just told my server and explained all i wanted was a fresh one, which she brought out about 20 minutes later and not one visit from the manager or any offer to comp anything. I didn't really mind paying full price but someone other than my server should have paid a visit to our table. Im sure i could have had all the above had i acted a fool but i chose to not do that and see how they handled it and was greatly disappointed. So, needless to say that was my last visit to Applebees....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-charlestown?start=20

They said no calls on card, manager was very rude to me and my wife he needs to be fired. He didn't even say here a coupon . For next visit my wife was very upset about he behaved he said he will not take credit card on phone. My family will not be going back. Lost a good family where there three times this week.

We could see why the apps were half off because I don't think people would pay $24 for an app. Other than that the food was average chain-style food, the service was fair, this Applebee's is much better than there Martinsburg location.

Emil C.,"Harpers Ferry, WV",0,12,,1.0,7/7/2013,Last time I will ever eat there.  I ordered carry out and when i pulled up i saw the cook smoking outside the carry out door. Then i followed him in the door and watched him go back to work without washing his hands. Gross. Then the manager (ashley) was at the carry out cash register with an un-lit cigarette hanging out of her mouth. These people are gross and stupid considering 70% of the population does not smoke.

Neck F.,"Loudoun, VA",5,137,14,5.0,3/21/2013,"Felt like giving this restaurant a review simply because its the best Applebees I've been in around here. Walked in and immediately did a double take, English speaking friendly employees? No way, I thought, I must have missed something. Nope sure didn't, staff was amazing right from the start. So nice to be greeted in plain English with a smile. No other area applebees has that bragging right. Food was better than the other locations I've tried, service was by far the best, staff must be from another planet, I've simply never had that kind of service in an applebees, they were phenomenal. Open til midnight too which is cool and they don't try and shove you out the door like most places do an hour before closing time.

Travis W.,"Ranson, WV",294,3,,1.0,5/13/2013,"came here for mother's day, taking my in-laws and wife out to lunch. oh boy, where do i start. there is several very inappropriate expletives i can use for how our server treated us, she had absolutely no interest in hearing us out, which is why it was no surprise that we were missing 2 salads and an appetizer when our order came (mind you in shouldn't take roughly 35 minutes of sitting there to just get appetizers), then she was very rude when we made a comment about it. i guess someone didn't understand the concept of working for tips. then finally after almost an hour of waiting, our actual entrees arrived. i ordered a medium rare steak with garlic shrimp. the steak was warm and red/pink in the middle, which was cool, but one entire of side of the steak is charred BLACK to the point of where is was inedible. also it had no flavor or texture to the meat, telling me it had frozen and thawed several times over. same story with my wife's chicken. HEY CRAPPLEBEE'S THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A ""SEAR"" AND ""STRAIGHT UP CHAR/BURNT"". the rice the that was served with my mother-in-law's and wife's meals were not only obviously tossed in a microwave, dried out, and several days old. i mean if you are going to reheat rice, at least throw some water or butter in with to rehydrate it. but the rice was also luke-warm/cold, which was also unacceptable. after i complain to my server, to who NO SURPRISE had no interest in hearing me out, went to get a manager who took another 15 minutes of my time with my family for mother's day to even get to the table. all i got from him was ""i'm sorry, i'll only charge you for the appetizers and drinks, and next time your meal is on us"" to which i responded ""i'm not paying dime due to (all stated above), and won't be back for 'another meal on you' as a matter of fact you should pay me for the ridiculous amount of time i have wasted on poor service and crap food''.  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS APPLEBEE'S BRANCH TO ANYONE, AND WILL NOT BE RETURNING.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-charlestown?start=20
Manny M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",5,87,238,3.0,5/18/2017,"Decided to stop by the friendly neighborhood grill, glad that I did. I haven't step foot in one in ages (approximately 6years). The overall experience was great, thanks to the friendly bartender. She provided expectational service and never once strayed from quality service.  Half way through my meal, three gentlemen were trying to do some attempting to split the ticket in a very complicated way, she did as they stated and when they got the bill, they began to argue that she screwed it up and that she was at fault, she apologizes and walked them through their request and redid the bill.  AMAZING!! Normally nowadays, servers just argue and take a defensive stance (which she has every right too; however, decided the smoother approach).   When people around us food started to come out before us, she apologized and went to the back to see why our order was taking longer than the others.  A few minutes followed and out came the food.  I ordered the 'All-Day Brunch Burger' As it sat in front of me I was disappointed at its appearance and quickly suspected that it would be subpar.  Nonetheless, to my surprise, it was a perfect blend of cheese, meat, hash brown taste.   A colleague of mine, ordered a sirloin with mashed potatoes and he expressed the same thoughts, appearance wise not appealing and worrisome, however, filled with flavor and very tender according to him.

Olivia C.,"Rockville, MD",637,200,320,2.0,6/10/2014,"I don't hold high regards for chain restaurants but this Applebee's is possibly one of the reasons why i try not to.  Let's start with the service- we waited at a empty host station waiting to be seated for about 2 minutes. 2 minutes isn't that long but during dinner time...to leave the host station unattended, come on management.  As for the food, everything came out burnt and steak came out medium rare when we asked for medium well.  I know the cooks didn't graduate from CIA but how do you mess that one up? Servers?  If you dislike your job that much, find another one, it's so obvious you would rather be elsewhere.  Please, my food tastes so much better if you weren't scowling every time you came by reluctantly to ask how our food was...

Sent it back three times and still was not appetizing enough to eat. THAT WAS 10 YEARS AGO. Last night I decided to try again... absolutely disgusting.

Ray R.,"Baltimore, MD",491,221,884,4.0,10/11/2012,"Food is irrelevant when reviewing restaurant chains because once you've been to one, you've been to 'em all. What makes the difference is the service and atmosphere and this location receives a great rating from me. Football fan wise-I bleed purple while my friend is a Steelers fan (no accounting for taste, I know). So, with last Sunday being the first time of the season where Steelers & Ravens both had games at 1pm, it was imperative that we both had the ability to watch our respective football games.  We walked in and the gates of football game heaven opened up. The bar had FIVE flat screens surrounding the bar perimeter AND a big projector screen in the middle of the bar section. Score and DOUBLE Score! I tried to work my charm on Lisa the bartendress to see if we could switch the Ravens game to the big screen but unfortunately the store manager was a Skins fan so that game got projector and sound system priority. No biggie. Customer service was excellent. Lisa was engaging and when I sent my dish back due to slightly translucent shrimp, a pleasant elderly lady with a beehive doo came out to apologize and asked if everything was okay with the redo. I assumed she was the grill master because I saw her bringing out all the skillet dishes. When our next trip to Hollywood casino falls on a Saturday into football Sunday, we plan to come back here to watch all the games at this sports bar like Applebee's.
