Miguel G.,"Valley Glen, CA",49,88,32,5.0,3/29/2017,"I am giving it a five star because we were so pleasantly surprised. It's Applebee's not a 3 star Michelin restaurant.  Their dinner two for 25.00 was great. The steak was cooked perfectly, the French onion soup was better than I have had in some French restaurants and their Mac and Cheese and chicken was awesome.  We were only coming in for a drink but the bartender, Richard, made us change our mind. This man truly understands customer service and hospitality.  We will be back .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chatsworth-2?start=40
M S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,5.0,10/7/2017,"I went to applebee's tonight for the $1.00 margaritas . We had to wait a while for a table because they were extremely busy, I guess we all want to have those $1  margaritas .  Anyway I have to say that I was very surprised that the margaritas were very tasty.  We order happy hour appetizers.  They were delicious too.  Mario our server was very friendly and efficient.  Even the manager came and talked to us to our table to make sure that we were doing ok.  She was also very nice and friendly.  thank you applebee's .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chatsworth-2?start=40

Belen G.,"Los Angeles, CA",35,12,1,5.0,9/22/2017,Came here on Wednesday around 3 with my husband and daughter. Both my husband and I are servers so we were not sure what to expect. My husband's standards are pretty high. We absolutely LOVED it! The 2 for $20 is an awesome deal. Everything was great from the service to the food and the drinks. I think our servers name was Amanda but can't remember. Definitely will be back thank you so much!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chatsworth-2?start=40
N G.,"Malibu, CA",0,5,,2.0,1/6/2017,"My boyfriend and I frequent this location at night  because it's convenient and the food is consistently good. We've had a blonde female sever twice who was fantastic, friendly, attentive, and prompt. If she had served us tonight, this would be a 5 star review. I wish I remembered her name because she deserves to be praised.  This particular visit was AWFUL. We waited over 10 minutes to be acknowledged and given a table. Needless to say, we gave up waiting and sat at the bar top for some drinks and appetizers. We realized it was nearing closing time so we planned on ordering our food to go while having a beer or 2 while waiting for our food.  (Trying to make it easier on them). The bartender grabs menus and we told her we already knew what food we wanted to order. We ordered our food and never saw her again. I mind you, WE WERE AT HER BAR TOP. She never offered us ANY drinks or EVEN water, at all. And when we called her over to order a beer, she completely ignored us. She was literally 2ft away from us behind the bar and still no reaction.  Fed up at this point, we look at the check and see that she charged us full price for our happy hour appetizers. I wanted to clarify with her if the reasoning was because we ordered our food to go, (which is understandable) but she wasnt available to speak to about it. We decided to cut out losses, pay the bil, and get the heck out of there.  I've spent many years in the service industry so I can be very sympathetic with servers and bartenders. But this was a case of complete disregard of our needs and overall disrespect and carelessness to us as customers. It's extremely hard and very rare for me to leave a tip less that 20%, but the occasion called for it. The food was consistently good (as always) and this has been my only bad experience so I may return and sit with an actual server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chatsworth-2?start=40
Nasseem A.,"Los Angeles, CA",43,9,1,5.0,3/6/2017,"The food was OK I had the baby back ribs and they were a bit tough. My wife had the steak salad which was awesone..  We had the chicken wonton tacos which my wife almost bit my finger off when I tried to take one... they were that good..do fresh and flavorful... The best part was our server, Jonathan, he was quite possibly one of the best servers I have ever met.. he was attentive, efficient, and fast. He made great recommendations and knew the menu really well.  He has the kitchen dialed in, which was great because our food came out so quick..  Ask for Jonathan when you go.

Waiter came by to fill my water, and in the process of doing so, spilled a decent amount on the table. Completely fine I totally understand that happens. But instead of wiping it up or even having the decency of apologizing he shrugs it off, and when I ask for a rag he rolls his eyes at me.

Denese V.,"West Hills, CA",15,70,203,3.0,7/30/2017,"If you are ordering online for pick-up, check your order and expect a 10 minute wait for your food even if you ordered well in advance. I've ordered 4 times now and there is either an item missing or I have to wait (which basically defeated the purpose of preordering). I go there on my lunch break which is why I've neglected to check the order before leaving. I typically wouldn't complain about the wait but when you're on lunch break, 10 minutes is a lot- hence, the PREORDER! As for the service, the staff is nice, but nothing to write home about. The food is good, but not worth the disappointment. Most recently, they couldn't find the order I placed 2 hours earlier, but the bartender found it immediately when he looked at the POS system (read my order aloud to me, still left out an item), so I'm not sure what happened there. I don't plan to go back anytime soon as there are a grip of restaurants in that center that are cheaper, taste better, have your food ready when you get there- all without messing up the order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chatsworth-2?start=40

I have never had a bad experience sometimes you have to wait but the service is always great and you know what your going to get with Applebee's.

Jennie L.,"North Hollywood, CA",121,220,327,1.0,10/15/2017,"This place is the worse place to come to when  at night or they have a promotion going on . I came in with my husband for a date night . We didn't have alot of time in are hands because we had a babysitter only for four hours . So when we came in we checked in , it took 15 minutes for us to get a table . Then we where setting and talking for a while then we got bored of waiting so we order are 1 margarita drinks through the mobile device on the table . Then 10 minutes after are waiter comes and ask if we are ready to order we said we just place the drinks but we would order appetizers . So she place that in for us . In the mean time she brought us water . When are food came out , they brought my husband beer and and my drink the margarita .  The manager pass by and ask how is everything , we said we are still waiting on are drink . So 20 minutes later a different person brings out my drink . Then we placed other order of appetizers with the waiter and order two more margarita . I ask with a different favor and she said they only have lime . So when I ordered it before on the mobile device it charged all the drinks with add favor . So then are food came out 30 minutes later with no drinks again . So then the waiter went in to check on them . We saw all the other tables get the same drink with four to five orders of it . Then after complain in so much to are waiter she brought it out . Then we just ask for the check but this was the worst experience ever and bad service ever . We spend three hours here .

It was so big and fresh! Adriana was such a great server! She was attentive and right on top of everything.   She made the experience really special.  Oh, the iced tea was so refreshing. They let me combine flavors so I had peach and raspberry and it was yummy!! I even had a table visit from the manager Maritza. What a great experience.

Eric W.,"Canoga Park, CA",166,672,148,4.0,1/22/2017,"Can't say I'd actively seek out Applebee's or its competitors normally. But we had tickets to a movie and wanted to enjoy a grown-up beverage and some appetizers. The location in the parking lot of the Winnetka movie theater makes this a great choice. There was a wait for a table before 6pm and by the time we left about an hour later, the wait had covered the lobby area and included the outdoor benches. This place is really popular on a Saturday night! The restaurant was packed for an early dinner. We sat at the bar and ordered happy hour beverages and both the mozzarella sticks and artichoke spinach dip. Everything was delicious and reasonably priced.  Service was really good too and the women tending the bar were extremely busy but friendly.

Sarah Y.,"Canoga Park, CA",77,117,3,3.0,10/20/2016,"I'm anxious to see how the service and food is. There website for ordering in advance is VERY frustrating. We start work at 5AM, so our lunch time is usually around 11:00 or so. The website says that the restaurant car side to go hours are from 11AM -9pm . So, I figured if I order a couple of hours ahead, the order should be ready to pick up  by 11:15  latest.  After I got everyone's order from the office picked, I went to the payment page and that's where my frustration began.  I found that the 11:15 AM was not an acceptable time when I went to submit the order; hence, all of the credit card information I put in was cleared. So, I used 11:30AM and pressed ""place order"" again. This time, an error came up saying that the credit card number was invalid. So, I fixed the number and hit ""place order"" again. Again, all the credit information was cleared and I had to re-type my credit card information again.  Whoo hoo, it finally went through. I hope they really get my order. I will call to confirm. After reading some of the Yelper's comments about bad customer service, I am a little worried. I will update! Ok, so the ONLY reason I am bumping this up to a 3 is because Fernando was sooooooooo helpful, empathetic to my ordeal with the website; plus we had a coupon, so the bill was very reasonable. Do not order the Chicken Cavatappi, unless you have at least salt and pepper. It is REALLY bland.  They need to maybe put some sun dried tomatoes, a little more basil and some parsley, a little seasoning salt and pepper. If the Sun dried tomatoes are too expensive then maybe some dill or rosemary? The house salad is actually pretty good. It has a lot of different kinds of stuff in it. I had my wn dressing at work, so I can't rate any of their dressing. But one order had the oriental chicken salad and the person swears the dressing is the best they have had. The 1/2 club sandwich that came with one of the grilled lunches was just OK.  The Two mini hamburgers with fries and a soda was ok.    If I have another coupon available, maybe I'l order something else on the menu.

She took our order and left. 10 min later she comes back with 3 of the 4 drinks and says she's still waiting on one more. Our appetizers show up but no 4th drink? We ask and she said ""it's coming out now"". She brings last drink and we wait for our food. 25 min later food arrives and it's somewhat cold, I didn't feel like saying anything because I have had it already. We finish eating and as I'm waiting to pay my waitress is nowhere to be found. I try paying on the tablet and it says ""$0 balance"" so I couldn't pay there. 15 min later I walk up to host and ask if I could pay there and they said they would get my waitress. I wait about 5 min and she walks by me and I think"" great I can pay and leave"" she then says ""thanks have a great day"" All I'm thinking is ""I haven't paid!!!""

stephanie c.,"Panorama City, CA",3,28,3,2.0,7/13/2016,"Came here on a late evening. We were immediately notified that the fryers weren't working which is fine. But some of our dishes required fryers for smaller items like tortilla strips so some substations were offered but not for all the dishes. This was the beginning of the inconstancy.  Our waitress was nice but her performance became dull. We ordered two drinks from the bar (we were seated at a booth next to the bar). Took about 20 mins to get our drinks because the waitress  said the bartender was busy with another guest. (Which we could see was clearly not the issue as the bartender was singing and dancing around her station). I saw when she made both cocktails it probably took less that 5 minutes to make both. I had an Adios MF which was so weak and diluted because about 20% of the drink was ice (I could barely move my straw).  Order came out wrong after taking forever to serve, even though it was only us and a few other tables as well as majority of the food we ordered didn't required fryers and they weren't making substitutes for the little part of the dish that did need it. Also, apparently you can't order roasted potatoes when the fryers are down? (They are supposed to be ""roasted"") Don't understand why they took a lifetime. We didn't complain but we didn't appreciate that our waitress didn't take any responsibility that we annoyed how long everything took and that one top that it was lackluster.

First off she forgot to bring me a glass of water after I had to remind her a couple times and it wasn't until we got our food after a good 45 minute wait that she finally gave me my glass of water. We all pretty much ordered the 2 for $20 deal that included an appetizer, entree, and two sides. I ordered the artichoke and spinach dip with chips for my appetizer which was good. However, I wish they would of at least brought out our appetizers to munch on while we waited for the rest of our food. For my entree I ordered a medium well steak which ended up tasting dry and hard to chew. I had to put a lot of A-1 sauce just to get some flavor and moistness to the steak. My sides included garlic and butter green beans and sweet potato fries. I was disappointed with the green beans because only a section of green beans had garlic and butter sauce and was not properly coated on all the green beans on my plate.

From the moment we were seated, we were completely and willfully ignored by the wait staff. When I flagged one down, she said she would be right back then avoided coming by our table. I pressed the ""CALL SEVER"" button, which flashed for 30 minutes, that went ignored. I had to order our food using the electronic kiosk at the table myself because no one would come by to take our order. Our empty drink glasses sat there for 20 minutes but no one came by to get offer to refill them. It was fairly busy but there was enough wait staff to serve all the patrons. When I finally flagged down one waitress, she appeared annoyed and said ""What do you want?"" I just couldn't believe the lousy or lack of service and complete and willful ignorance of a customer.

Jerry L.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,6,,2.0,1/19/2016,"My wife and I went to Applebees in Chatsworth for her birthday - per her request.   At the end of our meal, we ordered, as we have for years, one Blondie Desert with two spoons.  Yes, even at Applebees, we like to keep the romance alive.   I should mention that for dinner I ordered a Shrimp and Spinach Salad.  I know it sounds terrible, but In all the years I have eaten at Applebees, my order has never changed.  Even when Applebees took said salad off the menu, the chefs would still make it for me - talk about feeling special.   UNFORTUNATELY,  our most recent dining experience on January 10th, 2016 was not so special.   Three times we asked our waitress for glasses of water.  We never received them - not before, during, nor after our meal.    The Spinach and Shrimp Salad I ordered was about two-thirds (66%) it's normal size, AND the shrimp were lukewarm with a soft, (mushy), under-cooked texture,  Lastly, the extra cup of dressing I requested never arrived.  Of course with such a small salad, I wound up not needing more dressing. Our waitress was great, as always, but she was juggling a lot of customers.  My suggestions would be as follows:   1. Fire whoever/whomever has decided to cut salad portions.   2.  Schedule more staff on busy nights.   Again, our waitress had an excellent personality, and worked her tail off, but she was being pulled in so many directions, we didn't receive our usual great service - we don't blame her.  Perhaps my skimpy salad, with less-than-quality shrimp, was due to the kitchen being understaffed as well... Hello management.  Speaking of management - where was management?  Aren't they usually visiting tables and asking if the customers are enjoying their meal?  There was no management presence at all...

Lon M.,"Canoga Park, CA",1,62,3,2.0,1/6/2017,"Starting on a good note my wife seems to love the food here. Me not so much. First I don't like the service at this location and never really have. You'd think after all the many bad reviews on the service at this location they would have cared to do something about it by now but they don't care here. Nor does the upper management for Applebee's chain either. This place is service with all young adults mostly that don't seem to care much or provide all that great of service. This is a yuppie joint for young people. A bar basically surrounded by a restaurant just like the garbage Red Robin chains.  They seem to change their menu too often. They use to have this pretty good chips and dip on the menu, then it was just taken off. All the other appetizers at Applebees is mediocre nothing special. The pretzel thing with beer dip whatever is not all that great after a few bites. The steaks here are nothing better than  you could get at any Sizzler. Too much money for what you get imo. Not worth it. They have a bit better steaks at Chili's for around the same price. Really the only item on Applebbe's entire menu that I like is the fish & chips. I'm glad I found something I like to eat there at least seeing my wife likes this place so much. I get annoyed coming here. I don't like the crowd and noise and the servers here are too busy to give a rats about the service for any particular table. Been here numerous of times and it's always that way. You need anything, usually you have to stop someone to ask because the waiter can't be found. Another of many joints who take your order and then have somebody else bring out your food. Then you hardly ever see the waiter or waitress again to get drink refills or whatever you might want. Has happened on most every visit I can remember.  Also, after being here A FEW TIMES THE RESTROOM SHOULD BE KEPT CLEAN AND IT IS NOT! On 2-3 visits the men's bathroom is out of towels and the bathroom a bit filthy and you can tell it hasn't been cleaned properly. I mean after 2-3 visits and the same thing? Come on! Management here doesn't care. Notice by all the replies the management has left on the reviews here? LOL.  The Food: Besides the fish, the rest of the food I've ever ordered here (steaks, burgers, appetizers) is all just blah boring food and nothing special. Not even worth the money they ask imo.  Got to agree with another reviewer on here about the parking. The lot at this location sucks, is not handicap friendly at all because the entrance is way out on the street instead of the parking lot and if there is a long wait at this place I instantly want to leave because it's very uncomfortable with no room to sit hardly at all. Not even worth a 10min wait here. Loud inside and not a place to have a nice quiet diner at all. Or good service. And the background music they play is Taylor Swift and annoying yuppie new techno music.  If it wasn't for my wife liking this place I would never eat here.  And this is one of the very few restaurants that doesn't have Clam Chowder soup on Fridays? Wth? lol",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chatsworth-2?start=120

It definitely appeared that she was a bit overwhelmed carrying the load of her coworkers, although this did not phase her one bit.  Unfortunately, there were several mistakes in regards to our order and request due to the fact that she was delegating the request onto others who were failing miserably.  I can see how hard she was working and appreciated her follow up with us to make sure the task she assigned to others were completed with success.  She seemed more upset than us that her fellow staff members were dropping the ball over and over again.  Every error she discovered was quickly corrected and she seemed to be genuinely apologetic so we never felt angry or frustrated that our meal was being compromised.   She even went as far as getting her manager involved and removing the appetizer from our bill and offering a 10% discount on the remaining bill.  This was not expected since we did not request or complain about any of the mistakes.  That's just how observant and caring our server was!!! Overall the meal was still very good and the taste of everything was to our expectations.  The experience as a whole could have been a disaster if it were not for our passionate server and her keen eye.   I can't express how much we appreciate this type of service!!

My premium vodka is $5.50 and the Long Island Iced Teas are $3.75. Some shots are $3! And when you drink, some of the appetizers are 50% off. We tried all of them and the wings are good, the mozerella sticks and the chicken wonton tacos are great!! Honestly, I can't really vouch for the food other than the appetizers.

The meat was overcooked and a little grizzly. It did not taste like a real rib. The sauce was okay. I drowned the Riblet and enough sauce to make it somewhat palatable. My wife just had chicken strips. I guess how can you mess that up. The Diet Pepsi that came was flat and I was trying to make out what exactly it tasted like.

Okay, so manager told hostess that the ad is good...obviously.  Service was slow!  The table next to us wanted to get out of there for some time, but they did not have their check.  I ordered a drink, but it took about 7 minutes to actually receive that drink...almost received at the same time as the food.  In all reality, the waitress seemed to occupied and too busy.  A runner brought out our food, but one burger was missing the bacon stripes, another burger was missing the dressing...the manager came back with the missing items.  Our water glasses were never refilled once and it was pulling teeth to get a refill on my beverage.  I more felt rushed by my server, probably due to the fact that she seemed super busy and a tad stressed.  Maybe they were short that night and she had extra tables...I am not sure, but this truly was our first visit to Applebees and probably our last.  In fact, my family was here celebrating my birthday...not a very pleasurable experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chatsworth-2?start=120

I had the succulent Cowboy Burger with smashed potatoes. it was packed with big slices of bacon!!  The smashed potaotes costs $2.50 extra but well worth the price. We ordered potato twisters but to be honest, I've had better. The first order of twisters had twisted too long in the oil, giving them a dark tan. We sent them back and got a better colored batch. The manager was a very polite gentleman who offered us a free dessert. He didn't have to say that but ONCE! We ordered the bundt chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream to go.

The game was on but not on all TVs, the service- well the waitress we had was really sweet and on-top of our refills so that was great.  The food was ok. We did the 2 for $24 deal and usually that's great- you get lots of variety and good food- well at other places that offer it.  from what we ordered: -fried green beans-  they were ok-  the sauces that come with 'em are pretty gross though and not very fitting -boneless wings- a bit too much batter and fat on them, good as an appetizer since you're starving but too much after a good 3- you're over them -alfredo penne w/ chicken-  VERY BLAND-  they just put a tiny amount of alfredo sauce- so it was very dry, no flavor, and the tomatoes on it makes it strange and adds an overbearing taste.  -fiesta fettuccini-  (something like that)  also VERY BLAND AND DRY.  I wasn't very pleased with the food here, it's like low-budget frozen meals  the atmosphere also- well the type of people that were in there were less than casual, and not the kind you want to dine around.  I know that the bar area is cool for evening happy hours, but the food is just too bland. I get the 2 for $25 deals at Fridays and Chillis- and the food never lets me down at those places.   Not much selection here on that option either.

We were seated right away, and our waitress told us about all of the happy hour drink specials ($3.75 for Long Islands and Margaritas?!). She brought us water first because the drinks were taking a while at the bar which was perfect. She explained anything we had questions on from the menu, and we ended up doing the 2 for $24, spinach artichoke dip, mac n cheese with chicken strips, and a half rack of ribs. Spinach artichoke dip was good! The serving size was pretty hefty as well, so you could definitely split it more than 2 ways. My hubby was satisfied with his ribs, but I can't say more on that. The mac and cheese was good! I'm not a bacon fan, but that's my fault for not looking at the full description. Oops. :P The chicken on top also had an awesome sauce on it, so I was happy!

Are they the meat that dog food companies reject?  Still an unknown, I bit into my first piece. After some time manipulating a bite in my my mouth a small bone came out, or was that a shark's tooth? Either way it was a scary small piece of bone. I'm shocked they haven't already been sued from someone choking! Bite after bite it became this game not to swallow these pieces of bone.

We sat at the bar. The bartender we had was really friendly and upbeat, which I always like. We didn't really order much food. I just got the boneless chicken wings. Honestly, I think they buy them in bulk from Wendy's or something, because they weren't that great, but it was okay. for $4 bucks! I got a really nice martini for only 5 dollars - which..if you know Los Angeles, is super cheap for a martini - even at a chain restaurant. I'll probably be back, to try out their real food because I haven't been out to eat at an Applebees since I was 12 years old! haha.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chatsworth-2?start=220

We had 2 hours to kill before a movie across the way and decided to pop into Applebee's for some drinks. The place reminded me of a TGI Friday's but minus the rowdy crowd. The bar area had plenty of seating on a Monday (football) night. Our bartender was personable and on top of everything. Since it was football Monday, happy hour was extended and we ended up getting $3 beers and margaritas, which I thought was a great deal. The happy hour food menu also looked enticing, but since we already ate, we had to pass.

People that weren't even our servers were making an effort to make our dinning experience a great one without us even having to ask them. We got two orders of wings, which come in classic buffalo, sweet and spicy and a few other ones and we got crispy wonton tacos I believe, They were all really good and came out VERY quick.

I understand it's a Friday night but come on. We placed a order for the trio sampler... Boneless chicken wings,wonton chicken tacos,and steak quesadilla. The table next to us which where seated after us already got there appetizer. Well we waiting another 40 mins then we got the famous trio plate.. Food wasn't super hot like it had been sitting for a while waiting for a server to bring it to us. We didn't say anything. Next we asked if we could order the chocolate dessert we waited.. N waited the young lady came to pick up our plates from the sampler and said did they bring your dessert out yet? Nope so we waited another 10-15 mins wow she finally brought over our desert ... Ice cream was melted and the chocolate fudge cake was cold... I then told the young lady Berenice m about the situation if she could take it away n just get us our bill... She then went to the manager jeff to tell him about the situation... I guess he didn't care he never came to our table to apologies or ask he we wanted to new one.

We thought it was awesome that they had a wide variety of options for Happy Hour at decent prices. It was 4 of us and 2 of us got there before and ordered drinks right before our friends arrived but they ordered almost right after us. The reason for the 2 was that the service was extremely slow. Maybe they were short staffed or something but there is no excuse on my friends waiting for their drinks for a really long time and they would probably be still waiting for them if I hadn't called our server over. We ordered some food and it was ok, not bad but not spectacular either. I was really hungry, so anything would taste good to me. We ended up ordering another round of drinks and again they took a really long time. The thing that bothered us the most was that we had a clear view of the bar and the bartender took forever to get to making our drinks.

Brian D.,"Woodland Hills, CA",1,27,1,2.0,10/27/2017,"The service is horrible. The worst part is that they had plenty of staff on hand but they weren't doing much. We sat ourselves at the bar area tables and waited about 10 minutes with nobody coming around to give us a menu. I went to the hostess and asked how we get menus. She asked where we were seated so she could send someone over. Seems like a normal question except there were only a few other tables occupied in the bar area and she saw exactly where I was sitting. Anyways, I pointed to where she saw me get up and she said she would send a waitress over. About 5 more minutes go by and a waitress comes up to us and says ""we don't usually go to tables if they don't have a menu"". What? How are we supposed to get the menu? We order an appetizer and a margarita (no salt on it even though there was supposed to be, which is not a big deal at all but it just goes to show how lazy the staff is) and say we need  a second before we know what food we want. About 5-10 minutes go by and she hasn't checked to see what food we want yet. She only had one other table. At this point we have been at a table for probably 20 minutes and still haven't ordered our dinner, so we decide we can't take it anymore and we went to BJ's and had a great dinner. Friendly note to whoever runs this place because I would like for this to be a good place- It seems like you have plenty of staff, but they are very lazy.

After 45 mins of sitting at our booth our server finally came back to take food orders (we tried ordering on the little tabletop computer but it was dead, surprise surprise).  Every single table around us, including those who came well after us and ordered after us, received their food before us. This is probably at an hour and a half into us sitting. We ordered another round of drinks, opting for the holiday specials which were nothing but sugar and the presentation wasn't even good. Clearly the bartender didn't give a shit and the waitress either too busy or too nonchalant didn't care to get them made the right way. Two of our three plates were cold, like the chicken was ICE F**CKING COLD. They wanted to remake and I let them know I wasn't interested in waiting another 50+ mins for food. They took it off. No tableside manager visit, no discount for the inconvenience of waiting an eternity or having crap food or bad service. Nothing.

Our server said the kitchen was really backed up, however, a couple that arrived after us received their meal before us and was done and gone before we were even served.  I've been to this location several times and both my husband and I were disappointed in the service. Plus our server kept saying ""That will cost 2.49 more, this will cost 1.49 more"".

At least the last visit the service was good but the food not so much. This time it was bad all the way around. Let me just start of with saying that for years Applebee's was one of those places you could count on to get a decent meal. It was pretty consistent as far as service and food goes but I don't know what happened but this place is consistently bad. Ok it's not like your going to get a fine dinning experience at a chain restaurant and that was not what I was expecting. However you should be able to get decent food. Nope not here honestly my food tasted like cafeteria food, not good. I just have to say do not get the pasta it was over cooked and gummy twice. The sauce was bland so you can imagine a bland sauce onto of a sticky, gummy noodle. Yuk just had a food flash back. I sent it back and chose not to replace it with anything else as my husband and daughters food was also not good. On top of the bad food our server was bad. It was so dead in there and you would think it was packed with the slow inattentive service we received. Our server was not friendly and seemed to not get the basics. The one thing I can say was the manager was very nice. Came over to our table and apologized for everything. I felt like she was sincere but at that point i was over it. I will not go back again. I hate writing bad reviews but this was my second bad experience before I wrote one. Sorry Applebee's but something has to change over there.

Andy L.,"Pacoima, CA",283,220,6,2.0,6/5/2014,"First time at Applebee's was here. Went here with cousins after watching Xmen in the same plaza. It was alright, nothing special really.  Food: There were three of us, so we got the 2 for $20 deal and another dish. We ended up with boneless sweet and sour wings, cowboy burger, oriental chicken salad, and 4 cheese mac with honey pepper chicken. In total with drinks it was about $40, pretty good deal. Food comes out quick even though the restaurant was pretty crowded (Sunday dinner time).  The boneless wings were too salty, way to salty and tasted nothing like sweet and sour. Pretty sure it was classic buffalo sauce but they said it wasn't. Cowboy burger was actually the best thing we got. Thick patty with bacon, onion strings and bbq sauce; what's not to like about that. Comes with a small amount of bland tasting fries. We got crispy chicken with the oriental salad, good choice since it added texture to the salad that it needed. Was expecting a more vinaigrette like dressing but it was a thicker creamier dressing and it wasn't so good. The mac and cheese was pretty bland to, pretty sure there wasn't 4 cheeses in there, only saving grace with that one was the chicken, I can probably eat a bucket of that.   Service: There was a line when we got there but the wait was only 15 mins. Asked for a table of three and they only brought 2 menus and 2 utensil pack things. Server seemed out of it and not caring. I understand it being a little late and the dinner crowd but at least show some effort. I'd rather you try and fail instead of not trying at all. If service was better the experience would have been better. The person that brought the food out was really nice though. Drink order was messed up and lagged a little in getting it corrected. Tipped accordingly.  Location: Nice location really. On the outside of the Pacific Winnetka Theatre plaza. Right next to Habit and a Japanese Restaurant. Parking is plentiful and plenty of lighting. I think there is security riding around but not sure. Free parking as well if you were wondering.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chatsworth-2?start=200

It had bacon and jack cheese and tomatoes in it, and some interesting mayo-type spread on the bread.  It was fine but not worth the 12 bucks they charged for it.  I swapped the fries for a house salad that had way too much bacon bits.  The others I dined with got salmon and they said it was good.  For dessert, we had a brownie sundae (split between us) and that was pretty good.  They now have mini computers at their table from which all appetizers and desserts can be ordered.  So, we used that...although the touch screen was sticky and somehow the order never got placed, but the very nice waitress made sure we got it.  The computer also displayed our final bill and we swiped the card and even included tip on there (reminds me of the new technology they have in many cabs nowadays!)  All in all, a good dining experience.  Friday night, zero wait, and we were starving...you can't go wrong at Applebees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chatsworth-2?start=200

The waitress was very attentive and there was barely anyone in there, it was around 3 p.m. though. I ordered the fish and chips, with visions of Village Idiot-style ones...Yeah not happening. The fish was dry with some blah breadcrumb batter, the chips were just standard french fries. There wasn't enough tartar sauce! My friend's iced tea was really weak so she asked for a fresh one, which was also weak. I hope I don't have to go back, but their desserts did look good-- maybe they are doable? The $2.29 dessert shooters...Hmm we'll see.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chatsworth-2?start=260
Mark C.,"Agoura Hills, CA",0,13,,1.0,7/31/2010,"We'd not visited Applebees in a few years, for two reasons. First, all of the stores closest to us in Ventura County were suddenly closed awhile back. Second, our last experience had been so poor that after complaining we were sent a $100 gift card from Applebees corporate. On this visit, at the recently opened store in Winnetka, we'd hoped to use up the gift card and have at least a passably decent experience. We were disappointed. First, we waited 20 minutes before a server finally came to our table. We timed it. 20 full minutes. Then, in his haste to make up for the gaffe, the manager ordered our appetizers and entrees all at once, and every plate arrived at the same time. We spent as much time trying to make room for the food as we did eating it. Third, the food was barely good enough to eat. The ribs were dry and almost meatless. The fajitas were bland. The spinach artichoke dip was virtually tasteless. The shrimp spinach salad was wet and droopy. Only the crunch shrimp appetizer had an appealing taste.  Needless to say, we've now written off Applebees. They give even chains a bad name. We'd be calling to complain, but what would be the point? We certainly don't want a gift card.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chatsworth-2?start=260

But the thing is, my friends and I were so hungry after a movie and this was the only place that was really open... so we decided to grin and bear it. I must say I was pleasantly surprised. I would give the Oriental Chicken Salad I had 5 stars, if it werent for such slow and horrible service. I even knew some of the guys working there from high school.... awkwardddd. And there were tons of older drunk guys there trying to pick up older girls that were there for that very reason (can you say shitty dive bar?) that night. Everyone was happy with their food. It is kindof an upscale Denny's, but I was actually suprised at how good it was! We got the lunch specials (for dinner) and split them so we would each get appetizers and dinners and even desert for cheaper. And my god they gave me a HUGE portion of salad I could barely finish it all. And it was delicious. As well as their mozzeralla cheese sticks. Who doesn't love those?!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chatsworth-2?start=260
Sally G.,"Canoga Park, CA",0,8,,2.0,6/6/2013,"So yesterday me and my best friend decided to go to apple bee's. we got a server called Noah. Great friendly guy we order the 2 for 20 I got the steak house with rice steamed veggies and a extra order of fries on the side. So everything was going good eat my buffalo wings. That's when the manager comes and bring us our food. I said oh I wanted fries. Then she says I could get u some. Then I said I had ordered some already (friendly) She starts shaking her head talking saying no as if I was stupid n didn't know what I ordered. Me and my friend looked at each other feeling the vibe. I don't know if it was because we look young ? I was so mad at her being a manager she should not be talking to guest with that attitude. I honestly don't know how she went up as manager? I was going to complain about the way she talked to me but she was the manager so she wouldn't have done nothing about it. I have been to this apple bees plenty of times always gone great. The server got our drink everything perfect that is why I give this place a 2 star it would of been a 0 because of the manager but the server was great. Basically the manager messed up the whole place. I am just shocked a great restaurant like this would hire such a women.

susana m.,"Chatsworth, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/26/2013,If I could give this place a 0 I would!We went on a Wed.which Applebee's was not busy at   is where the problem starts are waitress as soon as she gets to our table gets there with an attitude.She doesn't even say hi and just ask us what we want to drink so we all place the drink order.We asked her if she could split our check she automatically says with an attitude that we could only split it if the table was split down the middle..so we say forget it just to leave the bill all together.she then ask us what we want to eat so we go ahead and place the order.Well once my brother orders his plate which includes a steak she then literally screams at my brother when she had to repeat something .My table did start laughing but it was only because we had never been treated  in such a rude manner.The whole time she was with her horrible attitude and basically threw are food plates at   the end we recieve our check and we notice she adds 15 percent tip which is what  where use to whenever we go anywhere with a large group it's was only 6 of us.If she would have been nice while she was helping it would have been fine we probably would have tipped her even more than the percentage required .But we felt that because of her messed up attitude we needed to talk to the manager .So I asked to speak to the manager he then comes over and instead of the waitress walking away she just stands there giving us all a weird   we explained everything that happened to the manager she then keeps on interrupting him and us and arguing that we were laughing at her and that all we want to do is not pay the tip.Which was not the case we were still going to tip her we just felt that because of her horrible service we had to speak to the manager.She kept on arguing with us saying that she can't believe that she has to help a large group and not even get tip..and telling us that we just had problem with tipping .Which as a hairstylist for me would not be the case I understand that  people should be tipped if they provide good service!!!I can't believe the manager a chubby Latino looking guy never told her to stop arguing .Once we leave we just hand her the money which at that point we where just ready to get out of there .She then follows us ton the parking lot to give us back 4 dollars that was leftover from what was paid ..the 4 dollars was in no way tip it was just leftover from the 100.We where still planning on leaving her the 15 we just wanted to talk the manager ...But the manager is useless moron that just waist his time helping the other white ladies that where complaining to.And the food had no flavor .no wonder this place had to be closed down and then reopened !,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chatsworth-2?start=260

Although my Long Beach seemed watered down, it was only $3, as was the Long Island and Margaritas. Their peach sangria was really light and sweet, with fruit cocktail in it as well. And the waiter tricked us into ordering jello shots by bringing over a bunch on a light up tray and offering them to us for only $1 each. haha lame I know, but I'm easily amused.  As for the food, the spinach artichoke dip came hot, slightly burned on the top, but in a good way. It also came with tortilla chips and salsa. My favorite however are the potato twisters, which are spiral shaped potato chips served with this cheesy pico de gallo sauce which has tomatoes, onions, and jalepenos all mixed in with the cheese! yummyy! We also had the mozzarella sticks which were okay, and for Taco Tuesday, they offer $1 wonton tacos (chicken or pork), but those were lacking flavor.
