Saul C.,"Riverside, CA",0,2,5,5.0,1/1/2018,Miguel did excellent!!! He was on top of everything. Food came out hot and everything was correct. Never had to ask for a refill on drinks.

Greg F.,"Chino, CA",3216,370,3522,4.0,1/6/2017,"Welcome to the Neighborhood!  We got turned back on to Applebee's during the football special because of their happy hour and burger specials. Some of our favorite happy hour specials included the Grilled Chicken Wontons, Steak Quesadillas, Spinach and Artichoke Dip, and the Boneless Wings. The presentation was very good, and the portions for the price during happy hour were excellent. In regards to the Any Burger Monday specials, I was surprised by the quality and presentation of the meal. It resembled a burger you might get a specialty pub. The meat was perfectly cooked, and the garnish was excellent. During the football season, you can order any burger for $6.99.  You can't beat it.  Try the American Burger or the All Day Brunch Burger if you're craving a taste of breakfast, lunch, and dinner.    Several beers and drinks are also included on the happy hour menu. They had the standard and most popular light beers, Mexican beers, and a few IPAs. I went with a few on-tap beers, and my wife chose the ""Perfect Margarita."" The Perfect Margarita has Grand Mariner, it is was in fact perfect. We sat at the bar, and the staff was excellent.  Try visiting Applebee's, and give their sporting atmosphere and happy hour specials a try. You might be surprised like we were!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chino-3
Bonnie Y.,"Chino, CA",125,741,3649,1.0,1/18/2017,Worst meal I've had for a long time... I shouldn't expect much but still!  The only thing OK here are the drinks and some of the appetizers.

Cole F.,"Chino Hills, CA",66,11,1,5.0,12/15/2017,This Applebee's has been around since I was a kid. My family and I used to eat here all the time especially after Church on Sundays.

Wings were really salty, my potatoes were really burnt, and dry from the heat lamp.

Looked over at us but didn't say anything, we weren't even given menus or even a simple smile. By the time she came up to us she asked for id's and walked away. We did not feel welcomed, we decided to drive 20 min out of our way to the Eastvale Applebee's instead of experiencing an even worse experience at this location. I understand you guys were closing an hour after we arrived but your bartender should make customers feel welcomed instead of us feeling like a burden.

Lisa T.,"Ontario, CA",206,144,83,1.0,2/17/2017,"I want to start off by saying I felt scammed here. Only came here to use an Applebees gift card and Visa gift card my family received for Christmas. Asked our waitress (Debra C.) to ring up both cards before applying cash. Applebees gift card was $25 and Visa was $50. She only charged $41 on the Visa and never returned the card back to us. So we ended up having to apply more cash than we should have. Did she keep the $9 for herself. She continued to say ""that's all the card has on there is $41."" Then she said sometimes gift cards don't work right at restaurants. Then she said well maybe it automatically added tip. NOTHING made sense. We asked the manager to put the $50 back onto the Visa card so that we can just pay cash because you cannot scam asians! lol I've never had such a hard time using a Visa gift card in my life. Please check your bill before and after payment. The way they handle money here is sketchy. I don't know what she's pocketing or what is for the register. Anyways, as for the food...exactly what you expected. Terrible. Edible but nothing sort of amazing.  Sat next to these drunk couples...so annoying. No wonder why no one goes here anymore. Staff act like they hate their job which they probably do. Not friendly at all. Don't waste your money, you're better off at in n out across the street . So many other places to go to.

I come here on Sundays sometimes. I sit in the bar area because there's generally no wait. I watch some football, eat very okay tasting appetizers, and bask, uninterrupted, in the glory of football season.  They offer all sorts of deals. My sister and I have been indulging in their appetizer deal where you can choose 2-3-4-5 of their appetizers (portions are much smaller, but good if you don't want to commit) for a low, low price.

Leanne D.,"Chino Hills, CA",3,106,4,3.0,8/5/2017,"My husband and I wanted to go somewhere for dinner that was reasonably priced tonight and thought we would try Applebees since we haven't been there in a while. Applebees has a 2 for $20 deal that includes a shareable appetizer and two entrees. I ordered the cedar grilled lemon chicken which was very light and tasty. My husband ordered the American standard burger. We decided to order the two side salads for our appetizer. All in all the food and the service was very good. Outside of a fast food option, $20 for dinner is not too bad.

We started with the boneless brbq wings- I must say these were good, but honestly frying up some pieces of chicken and throwing some sauce on them isn't that difficult.  For my meal I decided to try the new brunch burger- hash browns, fried egg, cheese, bacon.  First bite, I could taste something very funky. Once I dissected the pieces of the burger, it was the meat that tasted horrendous. It was the worst tasting burger I have ever eaten. This 10 dollar burger has nothing on In n outs $3 double double.  My friend's steak and shrimp parmesan whatever, was super chewy and hardly seasoned. The vegetables were literally just thrown on the plate, unseasoned and all. You would think that one of the more expensive items on the menu would be put together with a little more dignity than that! It would be nice to see a place like Applebee's, that serves a variety of options, use good products in cooking their dishes. You can tell by the way the food is prepared and how it tastes on how much the management/owners don't care about what it's customers are consuming.

Hugo M.,"Chino, CA",204,116,95,1.0,8/3/2015,"I've never had a bad experience here, but tonight was just bad. My girlfriend and I wanted to grab a quick bite before a movie. Well, first of all, I order their Lagunitas ""IPA"" and my girlfriend orders an ice tea. The serve drops off the drinks, we say ""thank you"", you would expect a ""you're welcome."" Nothing. We let it go.  We move on to our food. We decide to get simple stuff since we are in a hurry. I get their new pulled pork sandwich with fries and my girlfriend orders the Chicken Portobello with mashed potatoes. Simple right? Again, server just seems in a bad mood.  I then ask what type of Lagunitas the beer was, server tells me it's an IPA. My girlfriend, that is not a big fan of beer,  said that wasn't an IPA, it was a lager. I let it go since I had a couple sips of it and didn't want to waste time.  15 mins in, no food. 20 minutes in, no food. 30 mins in, no food. At this point we just want to go. We are about to miss our movie and our plans just got ruined. 35 minutes in, finally the food comes out. My girlfriends Chicken, does not come with mashed potatoes she asked for.  We finally talk to the manager. We just didn't want the food anymore. It wasn't worth the wait and for our plans to be ruined just made it worse. The manager was nice enough to remove the food from our checks. We did pay for the drinks since we did drink them. The manager told me that it was a different IPA, it was a lighter one. Never heard of that. Trust me, I know my IPAs. It was a lager.  One of the biggest reasons why I am writing this, it's because of our server, DEBRA C. This is not the first time we've got sat in her section. She just seems very angry and moody all the time. Is never polite and seems to do things in a bad mood. If I do come back, I will specifically ask NOT to be sat in her section.

Well, the experience here was disappointing. First of all while coming back from the bathroom and walking back to my table a waitress that was serving a nearby table ran into me with the tray and the dishes she was holding and barely muttered sorry. She actually ran to me with the dishes. I thought it was kind of rude but I still tried to give them a chance. Another thing is they lie about the promotion they have about giving you a free dessert if they failed to mention having a holiday drink and mentioning about gift cards. Don't think that you will actually get a free dessert if your waitress or waiter does not mention these things. Are waitress mention the drink but did not mention the gift cards and my entire table was positive of this but when we asked her about our desserts and she did not mention buying a gift card, she totally lied and said that she had mentioned it when we are positive she didn't. At the end of the day I really could care less about the desert, it's just the principle of the entire matter. Don't offer something if you are not prepared to be honest in giving it away.

Jarrod M.,"Montclair, CA",127,192,342,3.0,3/27/2014,"Another restaurant that has been around for years. I like this place for two reasons.  Outdoor heated seating and great Happy Hours.  I do not regularly review food quality.  Everyone has different needs when it comes to flavors and spices.  Since I am all over the map pending on the time of day and mood, it will not help you the reader for me to give my impression. This place sells reheated frozen food.  I ordered a artichoke dip appetizer to compliment my beer.  While eating I found a nice chunk of artichoke heart.  I was excited.  It was like getting that single curly fry when you order regular fries.  It is an unexpected and pleasant surprise.   This chunk was not pleasant.  I expect that most readers have had a piece of food that had spent too much time in the freezer.  When thawed and cooked it has a slight flavor of the coolant used in refrigeration.  This chunk flooded my nostrils with freezer fumes.  Worse yet, the aroma lingered.  It killed my appetite for more.   This place still gets three stars.  The Manager, Joe? is a pleasant man who routinely checks on his guests.  The staff checked on me when they saw my class only had a 1/3 left of my beverage.  I was the only one on the patio and they did not forget about me.  I appreciate the attentiveness.   Go to an Applebee's for their Happy Hours.  They have two of them.  3-6pm and another from 9-12pm.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chino-3?start=60

E G.,"Chino Hills, CA",6,48,17,4.0,3/1/2016,"This is another perfect example of a place that is not getting the credit it deserves. Hear me out, I'll tell you why I think this is true.  In all honesty, Applebee's franchise as a whole is pretty alright. It's not gonna wow you, but for what it is, it's pretty decent. I came back a couple times recently these past few weeks and again today. Prior to that I came here years ago, and in that time gap, they improved on their previous flaws. Like 3 to 4 stars inproved. How? The menu from what I remember has been simplified I believe, correct me if I'm wrong. There seems to be less stuff, granted there is still a lot of stuff to choose from, but i remember there being more. But what sacrificed for quantity, they made up for quality. The steak was actually cooked somewhat to my liking, I asked for medium rare, and it was medium/medium rare ish. Compared to last time and other franchises that serve steak you ask medium and it's well done. So props for Applebee's on that.  French onion soup had decent flavor, veggies tasted good, and the service is still really good. The waiters and waitresses are still nice and attentive.  Ok now the part that bugs me, and what I think is wrong with media, this site, and how are culture is today. I've seen other people's reviews on this place, like many others, I see there 1 star reviews... ok why. In the reviews I see positive things and people say ""good food,"" ""great service,"" ""overall good expeience,"" etc... then I see a 1 star review.... I see the flaws also and I can agree with them, but don't give places like that a 1 star. 1 stars are like worst of the worst, no redeeming quality whatsoever. Nothing good. Hense 1. If there are some redeeming or good things, fine give it a 2 or even a 3 stars. So it's fair. That's the problem, it just takes 1 mistake and ""yup, 1 star."" People today complain about the smallest things that I feel like they'll find anything to complain about even if it's something so small. Guys, be fair, if there is some good quality for it, then show it. Otherwise you'll be like me, reading other reviews and be like, ""ok if this place has good food and decent ambiance, why did it get a 1?"" That's like a teacher saying, ""oh your report on this subject matter was entertaining and I found it interesting.... F."" Wth?  If you don't like it here, fine you don't have to, it's fine.  But don't say some things are good and all of a sudden the end result is the worst grade ever. If that's the case, don't say anything nice at all if you're gonna give a place a 1 star. 2 or 3 fine, that means there's  ""some"" redeeming quality somewhere. But for me, my experiences have been good, if anything improved. 4 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chino-3?start=80

My chief complaint is about the ambience -- which I rate as being extremely poor. It is also easy to fix, but the management there simply refuses to address the issue.  This is the problem: We go there to enjoy an affordable meal and to talk with each other...we can't enjoy a conversation  because  1) THE BACKGROUND MUSIC IS EXCESSIVELY LOUD! We, sitting across the table from each other, are forced to compete with the loud speakers placed in the ceiling every 10 feet or so. Secondly, 2) POOR PLAYLIST SELECTION!  Instead of playing mostly instrumental music (i.e., classical, smooth jazz) which would be pleasant, pleasing, and conducive to conversation, they always play HARD ROCK stuff with lots of annoying lyrics!  You can barely hear yourself think with that crap going at high volume in the background. Never is there any quieter instrumental music being played.  I have spoken with the manager in the past (2-3 years) concerning this, but nothing has changed. He gives some bs-line about how the corporation sets the background music selection and volume...and he's not allowed to modify it. I think that's a real cop-out!   The good news is this: I don't have to spend my meal times there!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chino-3?start=80

The atmosphere is always nice because it's never overly crowded or loud so I can enjoy a few drinks and appetizers with friends after a long day at work.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chino-3?start=120
Joshua W.,"Henderson, NV",224,387,524,3.0,5/14/2009,"The best thing about Applebee's is their Sampler Platter! Their wings taste just like Hooters and they're boneless! Woo-hoo! The other favorite of mine is their Shrimp Parmesan Steak! If you're in need of saving some cash, Applebee's currently has a two-for-$20 deal that gives you two full plates of food! This location has been remodeled to a more contemporary style, but they removed their infamous wooden bar nooks that used to hang over the counter of the bar. Either way works for me, but I did like their old style as well. A few years back, when the Angels were in the playoffs, I spent the afternoon at Applebee's for dinner and started watching the game and asked one of the waiters to turn on the volume (since all TVs were on the same channel and everyone was there to watch the game). A few minutes later, the manager started walking around muting all the TVs. When I asked what the deal was, she explained that they're not able to have the TV volume turned on at any Applebee's restaurants. I really thought she was joking, but she was serious. Needless to say, we took off and finished watching the game at home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chino-3?start=120
Kelley L.,"Long Beach, CA",24,430,463,3.0,7/24/2010,"After a number of disappointing visits in the past, this Applebee's has definitely turned things around. The food tastes a lot better, and you get your money's worth, especially during the awesome Happy Hour and the two-for-$20 meals. My favourite: sirloin steak, which was cooked pretty well. The service has also improved, but it could be better if there was an employee ready to seat guests.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chino-3?start=140
Ozwald C.,"Chino, CA",6,27,34,2.0,3/25/2013,"Disappointed. I sat at the bar for lunch and the bartender was all sour faced for some reason. I still smiled and place my order. As I got my food I noticed she left to sit down and eat without bothering to mention anything. Tacky. After I finished my food which was good btw, she said she was on her way to go take her break. No "" thank you"" or "" have a nice day"". Sheesh. Food was better then I expected, but service was sorry for being one of three people sitting at the bar. I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chino-3?start=140

Kathy I.,"Chino, CA",0,4,4,1.0,4/18/2015,"Stayed in chino for my company's event got hungry and decided to order Applebee's to go. I should have used my better judgement and went elsewhere. Got to the restaurant ""to go"" parking spots were taken. I walk in and look for the to go section hostess tells me to go to the bar and they will help me. I'm literally standing there for 10 minutes and nothing 2 bartenders are to busy talking and helping alcoholics needs. Finally I get helped by someone else out of the bar he says to ask bartender to ring me up he never does. Other guy comes with my food and finally rings me up and tells me Johnny is going to go thru my order to make sure everything is correct. The ignoramus moron never did, by now I'm just disappointed and walk out without silverware. My food was gross and cold but then again what can I expect from a restaurant that will let themselves be embodied with such poorly customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chino-3?start=140

Did you know that the Applebee's are all different franchised own?!  That explains why the Walnut one is ghetto and gross and this one is the complete opposite! Judging by the decor alone this Applebee's stands out from the rest.  The bar setup is above par- with booths inside the bar area instead of the uncomfortable high chair table tops.  There are TONS of big plasmas set up to watch both football and baseball games. Food was better too. Overall, I think I found my new Applebee's to watch games at.   Order:  Oriental Chicken Salad & Riblets YUMMY! Ps.  Remember they used to serve ""Onion Peel"" appetizers!?!  With the horseradish sauce!?  Those were SOOO GOOD!!!  What can I do to bring them back!?!

Their food just didn't interest me compared to its competitors in the Chino Hills area such as Red Robin, Yard House or even Chili's! I came on a Friday night particularly for the butter pecan blondie! My cousin and I used to be in loooooove with this dessert and my tummy was def craving this yummy goodness that night! After ordering my dessert, I realized that menu had changed quite a bit since my last visit! They had new options such as the honey peppered chicken or shrimp! It all sounded very tempting! Sadly, my tummy just couldn't do anything more besides dessert and drinks! I love their drink selection at Applebee's! They have margaritas, sangria, beer, mixed drinks,  wine.. you name it! They even have Halloween drinks for the upcoming holiday! Hahha so cute! I ordered the berry sangria and my oh my! That drink was delishhhh! So refreshing, sweet, and just what I was looking for! I underestimated this place! We'll see my reaction after trying some of their new food.. I'll keep you posted, yelpers!

Yong L.,"Pasadena, CA",70,256,94,5.0,7/16/2010,"The food here is pretty good. Standard, really, as Applebee's chains go. The prices aren't cheap, but they do have a 2 for $20 special - 2 full meals and an appetizer for $20. It's a good deal, and the selection has some delicious choices. Their chicken penne was pretty great, as is their spinach/artichoke chips and dip.  They have something called realburgers, which is supposed to be a higher quality burger with more of everything. I tried the A-1 peppercorn realburger, and was not disappointed. It was juicy and delicious. But more than the food, what really stuck out to me was the outstanding service. Not only did our waitress check up on us more than once to see if we needed anything, so did the hostess - AND the busboy! I was impressed. They have plenty of tvs here both around the restaurant and the bar for sporting events and such.

I didn't eat it, neither did my friends who experienced the same. We left. I decided to give it another chance for happy hour. The waitress was friendly but she only came to our table TWICE the hour and half we were there. We had ordered dessert with our drinks but only got our drinks. After finishing them we waited 20 minutes and she was still nowhere to be seen. We had to physically get up to ask a waitor to give us our check.

You go out to lunch. :) Applebee's became the choice after seeing a massive line at Mimi's next door. But that's okay, because we weren't a picky group. We just wanted food. I ordered a salad here. I should have ordered the whole salad instead of a half size, because when it came I was highly disappointed. The amount of chicken I got was plentiful, but the amount of lettuce in the salad was minimal. I thought there would have been more lettuce in my salad. I left lunch feeling quite hungry. The salad was tasty. It was the Santa Fe Chicken salad. The chicken was grilled. There was cheese and pico de gallo sauce along with guacamole and sour cream. The salad was a bit soggy from the dressing and pico de gallo. I don't know if I'd get this salad again. If I do, I might ask for the dressing on the side so that the lettuce stays more crisp and fresh.
