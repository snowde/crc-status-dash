Jeremy B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",17,79,161,4.0,12/15/2017,Fun place for late night apps. Usually that's where we stop for the apps and the night cap. Avoid steaks but the apps are good!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarion
Naz M.,"Kalamazoo, MI",313,132,120,3.0,1/7/2016,"On a cold night, just after New Year's, the man and I decide to head back to the Mitten. We needed gas, weren't very tired and wanted some reliable food that would stick for the next 4 hours of our drive, at least. Applebee's in Clarion was a perfect stop. Open late-ish, until about midnight, with reliable menu items, we went in with meh expectations. The food was absolutely meh, but the service was good and after 5 hours on the road, I'll gladly take that. I don't expect much of chains, but the food got the job done. It wasn't the best meal ever, but the portions were good, it stuck for the next 4 hours and our server was sweet.  This is a solid stop if you're on a road trip on 80 going east or west. It's super close to the highway, gas stations and other places of interest to those on the road. No need for more. You know?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarion
Damon N.,"Clarion, PA",34,2,,1.0,10/1/2017,Ordered mozzarella sticks & wings. Mozzarella sticks were warn and not melted & the wings were horrible. I think they were from a bag and not fresh.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarion
Ryan M.,"Clarion, PA",35,7,5,4.0,12/11/2016,Normally not a fan of Applebee's for other than a drink and maybe a app. Today decided to have lunch while watching football. All I have to say is food quality has improved at this location since the last time. Bourbon Ship and Chicken with onion rings was very good!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarion
Aaron C.,"Port Saint Lucie, FL",0,15,7,3.0,3/31/2016,"Average service (as to be expected in a college town), and average food. It is however clean and modern inside.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarion
Jin Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,745,2338,3.0,10/21/2014,I've been to Applebee's a few times in different locations because my options were quite limited while on the road. So during one of my road trips I stopped by this Applebee's for lunch. They had a lunch special going on and I had a salad and a sandwich combo. The food was very average and nothing special. I also ordered a strawberry daiquiri and it was water down. Not all Applebee's are made equal. Some are better or worse.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarion
Daisy A.,"Jersey City, NJ",1,18,36,3.0,11/2/2015,"KD ( The wwaitress) is very good in customer service. We ordered Savory Cedar Salmon. Since we don't eat Red potato we asked to replace it with rice but The vegetables will remain. We were charged extra $1.49 for When The food arrived, its only Salmon with rice without The veggies. We complained that we need The veggies. Then we were told that The Red potatoes come with The veggies. So we asked them to give us The Red potatoes with veggies since we are payong full price plus extra for Rice. The Red potatoes came with little spinach. We ate The spinach but The Red potatoes were wasted.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarion
Will A.,"Town of Smithtown, Long Island, NY",42,247,22,3.0,10/24/2015,Great food really enjoyed our appetizers wings was delicious. Staff members had good service and polite as can be. Loved my burger came out fresh and juicy made exactly how I wanted it well-done. Place is also well maintained seems like the restaurant gets a good clean ever hour or so cause its not to dirty on the floor.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarion
Nautichelle D.,"Cleveland, OH",9,68,17,2.0,4/19/2014,"Food was as good as any Applebee's, but management & service was poor & not compliant, and took way too long to get salads that weren't made to requested order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarion
Brenda W.,"Detroit, MI",0,3,,1.0,5/8/2014,"Cemented my long-standing opinion of Applebee's as being awful. Tortilla chips were super salty, sirloin was rubbery and broccoli tasted like they had been nuked for 20 minutes! I would've been better off bringing a frozen dinner with me to have them microwave in the kitchen. My brother felt sick shortly after eating the pasta. How does one get sick from pasta? Service was great considering the poor waitress has to serve what she has to serve. Asked us several times how are food was and I couldn't bear to tell her the truth-she tried. Chef Mike (microwave) does it again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarion
Michelle L.,"Mooresville, IN",0,21,,5.0,6/6/2015,"Wow, blown away by the hospitality of this place. They were so accommodating and the food was well prepared, and our waitress was super helpful and sweet",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarion
John G.,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA",6,102,3,3.0,12/27/2014,"Food is good, the service is very hit or miss. Depends on which college kid is working that night. I've had mostly good experiences dining here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarion
Michael B.,"Chanhassen, MN",0,9,7,1.0,8/16/2014,Worst service ever at a chain -- no wonder it was empty.    Slow food service but ok.   Try Perkins across the road.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarion
Brian A.,"Woodbridge, VA",28,28,29,4.0,12/8/2012,"I was impressed with the taste, variety and service at this location.  Maybe it was the updated menu, the number of healthier options, the friendliness of our server or a combination of all of the above that turned my skepticism of eating at a seemingly generic chain restaurant into a decent dining experience.  I will return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarion
Jean M.,"Austin, TX",3,23,15,5.0,9/11/2012,"From the staff opening the doors through the leaving, this Applebee's is a friendly and effortless place to eat. The food is well executed and fresh, wait staff eager to please but not pesky. We can linger, or eat and leave. We especially like the tender garlic steak and the maple- tinged pecan crusted chicken salad. If the staff do not have a ready answer to food questions they check with the kitchen to find out. Restrooms clean, restaurant clean. After many visits we have found these attributes to be consistent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarion
Mark G.,"Spencer, NY",110,23,30,5.0,8/2/2011,Good cheap food for the hungry landman. Good fast service too.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarion
John D.,"Wheaton, IL",0,5,,4.0,7/24/2013,I stopped here 5 times on my trips to see my grandchildren in Connecticut.  The food has always been excellent and the prices a good value. I will be back again when in the area.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarion
TJ P.,"Chicago, IL",1,7,,5.0,6/16/2012,"Very good Applebee's location! Staff was extremely friendly, food was great/thoroughly cooked, and service was very punctual. Would return if in the area again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clarion
