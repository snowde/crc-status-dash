Ed P.,"Tualatin, United States",47,335,115,4.0,27/7/2016,"We had a family dinner here on July 7th, 2016, to celebrate a birthday and a graduation. Twelve of us arrived, and a genuine effort was made to accommodate us, to seat us together at an extended table. To further complicate it (for the server), the billing was divided to three checks. A situation like this requires an organized individual, and our server, Isaac, was a wizard.  I was seated beneath a speaker, and the music's volume made it impossible to participate in the conversation, so I asked that the volume be turned down. My request was accommodated, and I appreciated that.  Isaac added to the occasion with his energy, good humor and attentive service. Our orders were hastily, tastily prepared and we enjoyed our time. Isaac overheard the birthday wishes, and some of the staff sang a ""Happy Birthday"" to one member of our party, and Isaac has an amazing voice!   Our visit was fun, the food was properly prepared (consistent with other properly managed Applebee Restaurants) and that rates at least 3 starts. The quality of service we experienced, Isaac's patience, organization and humor, added significantly to a great evening. That rates a 4th star! The events of the day, and the dinner, were memorable.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clovis-4?start=20

But the last two times we have gotten car side to go orders they have let us sit in our car for a good 15-20 minutes before one of us walks inside to check on the order, which basically defeats the purpose of car side to go. They used to come to the car and at least take care of payment so if the food is not ready we at least knew they were aware we were there. But waiting that long we begin to feel like they don't know we are there and don't care. Then tonight's food was awful.

Christian L.,"Fresno, United States",0,22,,4.0,31/8/2017,"My boyfriend and I dined in here on Tuesday night and I wasn't disappointed at all! We came in at 11:30 (yes, we were those hungry and annoying last minute customers, hoping for good food and service.) We ordered their Brutus Modelo and Stella Artois since their Happy Hour specials are from 9pm-12pm (awesome)! We then ordered the 2 for $27 and got matching salad appetizers. The salads were presented so pretty from past times that I've been to Applebees. I really appreciated the presentation of my garden salad lol. Next our steaks came out, cooked perfectly and well presented again! Good for you Applebees!!!! Especially since the 2 for $27 had went up $2 since we'd last dined in! The only thing I wasn't crazy about was my mixed veggies... I was given 3 pieces of grilled zucchini, squash and red bell pepper. I told my boyfriend that maybe this was what they had left since we were one of the last customers...I sure hope so!!!! We nervously ordered a side of fries at about 12:45, on their super convenient table tablets and they came out shortly, crispy and perfect! Our waiter Paul was then nice enough to ask us politely if we'd like our brownie bites (delicious!!!!) boxed to-go. Of course we said yes since it was about 12 now. They came with a side of vanilla ice cream and we enjoyed them both when we got home!

Christy P.,"Fresno, United States",0,13,20,1.0,5/10/2017,"Haven't been to Applebee's in a while. Decided to pop in on a Thursday for their October Margarita special. Walked in, no one in the front. So we sat down waiting for someone to come in the front & a group of 4 came in right behind us. It was like no one noticed that ""customers"" walked in. A waitress was at the front desk & organizing the menus but she doesn't say anything, no greet whatsoever. The group after us got up & puts their name down & then I walked up, and a group of 5 just walked in, & got their name written down, then my name next. She said ""there was an hour wait"" which turned out to be like 10 mins really. I don't drink margaritas, but can't pass up on $1 drinks so I really don't know there were different versions of their margarita special. My first order of margarita was the non-special price but the waiter was able to switch it the $1 ones. It would been a little helpful, if they mention the margarita special when they asked for drinks earlier so I wouldn't have been confused on my part. I don't like that happy hour is only in the bar, the bar gets too packed and crowded & I prefer a table to eat my food. I've been to other locations where I can sit in the dining area & happy hour is applicable.

Brenda G.,"Fresno, United States",0,23,,4.0,6/9/2017,"I have some peculiar food allergies and diet restrictions.  (no soy, some types of dairy I need to avoid, and no gluten; plus NO SEEDS).  My husband and I decided to do the 2 for $20 in the back of their menu.   So I ordered the Grilled Chicken Breast with Bacon Beer Cheese. My husband got the Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp.  Both were super yummy!  That 2/$20 has options to come with a salad, which we ordered.  Because I cannot eat seeds, the server had to keep the tomato's and cucumbers and gluten-laden croutons off my salad, which he did. Also discussed a dairy-free salad dressing options and decided on their vinagarette.  When the salads were delivered, our waiter came by, barely a few seconds later, and looked at my salad and he said ""your salad just looks so plain...   lets put our heads together so can I get something to cheer up your salad""!!!  So we decided a small amount of shredded mixed cheese would be ok and some fresh cooked chopped bacon.  He brought those in separate little ramekin dishes.  I now had the perfect salad for me and I was so happy!  I tell ya--- most other places I have been do not give such nice, considerate, personalized customer service!!!  Applebees is fast becoming my favorite place!!!   I think Applebees creates a culture where nice waiters like Jeff can flourish in their career.  We frequently have evening appointments in Clovis and we will be back to this place for dinner.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clovis-4

Asian honey sweet spicy?: (boneless) :  ok so I'm not a fan of ""original"" favor, nor am I a honey BBQ sauce lover, so I decided odd man out: Asian sauce ok!

Always ask for extra pico de gallo if they have it. The fresher the better! And chicken wonton tacos 4 of the for $5 on happy hour. The fried wonton tasted funny BUT whatever the chicken and slaw paired nicely together. But if you squeeze fresh lime on the wonton cant taste the funky lol!  My girlfriend got the bacon burger med rare with fries and she finished her plate. She NEVER finishes her plate, like really if it's not good she'll send it back but she finished her plate.

So I get this brownie to go about half an hour before they're supposed to close. They don't warm it up, they give it to me frozen and tell me to microwave it. Okay, whatever. I get home, and the fudge is everywhere because they just threw the container in the bag carelessly. I was pissed. I tried eating a couple bites but my pregnancy rage took over and I was like, F this stupid brownie and the fudge that spilled everywhere, I'm taking it back and getting a refund. So I get back a few minutes before they close and ask for a refund. They were surprisingly a lot more accommodating than I expected. The manager asked if I wanted the food remade, I said no just give me my money. Then he offered to remake the food and give me a gift card. I was like, I don't know. He insisted on doing both, so I said okay. And he apologized a lot, and so did the guy that handed me the food. They were all nice and it made me feel a lot better.

We had a party of six on a night that wasn't too busy and we ended up staying over three hours due to the fact that our waitress ""forgot"" to serve our food. I'm pretty patient when it comes to these types of situations so I only assumed that she was new or that something was going on in the kitchen BUT time after time I would see her socializing, standing in one spot, and laughing with her coworkers. Even then, I still wasn't too frustrated but the thing that set me off was that by the end of the night, she mixed up our checks twice and didn't even bother fixing them a third time even though from the very beginning we told her how we wanted it split. Anyways, she specifically told us, ""They're all around the same amount so... whatever."" and proceeded to walk away. SAY WHAT? Also, no apologies whatsoever. Oooo girl. Of course, we still gave her a small tip because hey, she could be going through a rough time... but man oh man I'm not coming back here nor would I recommend anyone going here. Sorry Applebee's!

Ariel S.,"Clovis, United States",0,6,3,2.0,27/6/2015,"I've been to this Applebee's location several times and I definitely experienced better service than the last time I went. For Father's Day 2015, we went to this restaurant in the early evening, it wasn't packed yet. Waiting time was short to be seated (about 10 minutes).  The problem began when we were assigned a waitress. Man, that girl was hardly friendly. Come to think of it, the waiters at the other tables weren't happy looking either. Our waitress was impatient when asking what we wanted to drink; acted like it was so much trouble repeating what sodas they have. I asked if they had Dr. Pepper and she said ""nope."" Uhhhh... Just one word, really? Didn't even give suggestions. When my father was ordering, she didn't explain the 2 for $25(?) deal thing properly so it left him confused thinking he was ordering right. Later on in the service she realized her mistake and tried to fix it. While taking our menus away, she dropped one on the table, and didn't seem to care that it bothered us. ""Oh sorry about that."" Her apology barely seemed believable.  We didn't have silverware at our table. Guess it wasn't common sense that a family of three needs extra napkins instead of the just one that is wrapped around the eating utensils.  The waitress wasn't serving food to a lot of tables, sooooo I don't know what her excuse was for forgetting what my table ordered. When she brought the food out, she said the name of the dish in a questioning manner as to ask who the plate was for. That's the job of the waiter to remember.  If it was up to me, she would have gotten zero tips, but my parents tipped her anyway.  Moving on from the waiter area....the food was good. Double Crunch Shrimp is a little hard to bite through, but that's because it's....double the crunch as the name implies. French fries good. Classic boneless buffalo chicken was good.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clovis-4?start=60

Our waitress was Rachel and she was very sweet!  She had a lot of recommendations/suggestions which was helpful because I hadn't been to any applebees in over 5 years.  My dinner was  3 cheese macaroni with chicken strips, and it was really flavorful.  My wife had a turkey club sandwich and said the turkey tasted like thanksgiving turkey instead of regular lunch meat turkey.  While we were eating the store manager stopped by our table to ask us how our food was,  and I saw him going up to the other tables to check on them too. His name was ""Trucker"" which I thought was a joke but I guess is his real name!  Anyway,  I'm surprised at all of the bad reviews on here because we genuinely had a good experience and will definitely be back!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clovis-4?start=60

Elizabeth H.,"San Francisco, United States",0,1,,1.0,21/1/2017,"I am a regular guest at this Applebee's, however my experience tonight was infuriating. I ordered a Coronarita and our waitress was already having attitude. She comes with my drink and there are black stuff floating in my drink. It looked like black pepper flakes but appeared slightly larger in size. I asked for a new drink, the waitress appeared to be irritated, she did not apologize and then stormed off with my drink. She comes back with the new drink two minutes later, and there are still black shit in my drink. I tell her once again that there are stuff floating in my drink so she takes it back and once again did not apologize for her shitty attitude and service. The waitress then comes back to my table and tries to explain that some blueberries fell into their ice, and that the floating black stuff were from the blueberries. First off, Applebee's has an ice machine in their kitchen, so if blueberries fell in your ice then toss that shit and get new ice. Also the people at my table got drinks as well and their cups had nothing floating in it. I'm guessing they don't wash their cups and that explains the black stuff floating in my drink.

When I examined my sandwich I noticed that whoever prepared my sandwich forgot to remove the wax paper that separates the cheese slices. This left me without an appetite.

We sat at the bar and immediatly remembered why we NEVER come here! The bartender Victor made us feel like we were bothering him just by sitting there. It was yesterday (a sunday) not busy at all, we waited for menus and for him to take our drink order for at least 5 min. He saw us sit down and continued to ignore us. When we finally got menus I ordered my drink and a water as well as my friend. 15 min later he asked us for our food order. He never asked to refill our drinks or check on us at all. The manager went behind the bar and ignored our empty glasses as well!

We sat in the bar, which I don't really like, but it was nice to be seated right away. Our waitress was super nice and helpful. She brought us our water right away. Our bar drinks took a bit longer but that was to be expected. She apologized for the wait but it certainly wasn't her fault, and we didn't mind. When I noticed my appletini didn't have a cherry (come on, the alcohol-soaked cherry at the bottom is the BEST part!) she immediately brought me out three, on a sword, for my drink!  Our food was good, typical Applebee's fare. My tortilla chips were so greasy that they actually were soggy, which wasn't the best.

Good environment for dating and usually there are competitions  which keep it fun for friend hangouts. The only downside is to get food on happy hour prices you are required to dine in-- this isn't good if you have older family at home or people who don't like to go out to dine to enjoy the quality food of Applebees and the convenience of happy hour prices. Many times I've taken trips here trying to get management to bend on this rule because my mom really wants to try their food but doesnt make alot of money and she doesnt like to dine out. I go to the business for a quick wing fix, eat them, and go.. I don't see why more profit is gained from sitting there as opposed to taking your food to go, you'll still be back for more.

If I could give negative stars I would!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clovis-4?start=40
Steve E.,"San Diego, United States",1,25,9,1.0,12/6/2016,"Worst Service ever! Came in went to the Bar a new person with minimal support. Tried to get drinks but she didn't know pricing although had in book and showed. Went with water and ordered our food, the order process took 45min. She kept fulfilling other waiters drink and request telling hold on. An hour into ordering just as we should of walked out manager came to help with the order and in a sly way up sold my order. Seriously just wanted to eat. Got the wrong order and she took my plate away, food was burnt, just wanted to leave. 3hrs there with everything messed up thought I was on a TV show. Worst service right before I shipped out for the military thanks",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clovis-4?start=40

For the sirloin being $14 after taxes it was not worth it. All the other food was good.

Kim C.,"Fresno, United States",26,98,92,1.0,18/4/2015,"Came here late on a Thursday night. We were seated in a dine in area due to the fact we had a few kids in our party. Waitress was friendly. I wish I had good stuff to say but sadly, I do not.  Pros:  1. Love the late night 1/2 off selected apps. Portion sizes were good and hard to go wrong with mozzarella sticks, boneless wings and chicken quesadillas.  2. There is a tablet type thing on each table that helps keep the kids occupied (this will also be mentioned as a con below). Apparently, it allows customers to reorder items and make requests.  Cons:  1. Waitress didn't come by often to offer refills. We were there about 1.5h and she came by 3 times. Once to take initial order, then to take actual order and then to bring bill. The other times we flagged down other staff for assistance. 2. The great tablet thing I mentioned, well come to find out, it costs $1 (per game! but apparently they just changed it to a flat fee or something. Not too sure according to manager who was also unaware/surprised that NO ONE told us about a surcharge and a little confused about the updates). Would be nice if the machine or the waitress gave us a heads up with a ""btw, if you want to play games, they will be yada yada yada"".  3. My friend saw a staff member use the restroom and left without washing his hands. *GROSSSSSSS*! Ok, yes, the team member was no longer on the clock as after he walked out of restroom, he walked to parking lot and left. We mentioned this to manager and she was trying to tell us that ""oh he's off the clock and I understand your concern."" Ok, yes, I agree he was off the clock. But people are creatures of habit. Im sure he didn't just not wash his hands this one time cause he's clocked out. Usually if someone doesn't wash their hands, its cause they normally don't. Luckily, we had already eaten and paid for our meal, otherwise I would have got up and left. I'm sorry manager, even if he was off, that is UNACCEPTABLE. We will not be coming back to this establishment and wouldn't recommend it either. Maybe at another location but not here where hand hygiene and public/consumer safety doesn't matter once someone is ""Off the clock"".",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clovis-4?start=40
M. M.,"Fresno, United States",7,54,27,1.0,7/5/2016,I love the apps here but service is HORRIBLE! I ordered my food before going to Carside to pick up I was told 15-20min wait. I end up waiting 40 minutes and had to call to see if someone was going to come out to take money and give me my food. what is the point of Carside services of I have to go in. I have 2 small babies and it would be completely hard to drag them in and try to pay and grab food at the same time. ratings don't lie on services it really sux. too bad this has to be the only Applebee's in clovis,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clovis-4?start=40
Connie A.,"Fresno, United States",27,2,1,1.0,30/8/2016,"While out with my husband and daughter this last Sunday we decided to stop at Applebee's in Clovis for a nice late lunch and drinks. The place was empty so we expected to be seated quickly and be eating soon. That was not the case. While about 6 servers stood over no one was being seated. After about 10 minutes we were shown to our booth I ordered a mixed drink that took another 10 minutes to receive. The restaurant wasnt even full so we couldn't understand the delay. Another family of four was also irritated as their own food hadn't come after over an hours wait. Finally they got up and went to pay for their drinks and leave and the waitress finally came out with their food but they had obviously had enough. Our meal came out 10 minutes later and they dropped my steak. So didn't get my meal but I was offered the food the other people left lol like seriously you think I didn't know that was someone else's order. The service sucked, the food was cold, and everything about the situation sucked! I will not be going back again. I don't recommend to anyone.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clovis-4?start=40

Lilian H.,"Fresno, United States",0,15,2,4.0,2/6/2017,"I am very happy that my boyfriend and I chose to come here tonight. We've been here many times before and I'd say tonight was our very best experience. The host, Dani, immediately greeted us and made sure to update us on available seats at the tables even if I asked for a booth. She checked in on us while we were outside twice and it's good to know we weren't forgotten. She was extremely friendly and had great customer service. Our server, Ricky, also did a great job. He greeted us and asked what we'd like to drink immediately and brought us our drinks soon after. He didn't leave us sitting there for twenty minutes even on a busy night. Our food came out quickly and Ricky made sure to check in for refills or anything else we needed. Our food was great as well. I definitely recommend the siracha shrimp appetizer. The chicken cavatappi was okay but my boyfriends American burger was great. I'm glad we came here.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clovis-4?start=40
Shawn H.,"El Cajon, United States",59,13,10,1.0,28/5/2016,Absolutely the worst service I have ever had any were we got ignored because a large group was more important we never got half of what we ordered and we got 2 of 4 drinks,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clovis-4?start=40
