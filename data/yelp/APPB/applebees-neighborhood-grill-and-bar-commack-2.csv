Daniel S.,"Stony Brook, NY",109,119,484,4.0,10/15/2017,"Came here for dollar margaritas! The service was top notch and margaritas rolled on in quickly per request. We first shared a couple of tortilla chips with creamy spinach and a side of salsa - an all time favorite, you can't go wrong choosing this - and then enjoyed our main courses. I had a burger .. which I'm not sure on the name right now, but overall it was pretty good. Not mindblowly awesome on the flavor scale, but I was pretty damn hungry that day. My reasoning for the 4/5 is because of the solid level of service provided despite the place being swarmed with patrons. The staff handled things well delivered!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-commack-2
Sara G.,"Smithtown, NY",0,4,,5.0,1/6/2018,"Probably one of the best Applebee's I've been to. They're always crowded around half apps time but they get their tables cleaned up quick and the next group in super quick so the wait time is never horrible. The waiters are always so friendly and quick, they really want you to have a good experience. Last night I had dropped my pasta all over myself while packing it to go and my waitress, Nicole, offered me a new one to bring home and got it back to me super quick. Highly recommend this Applebee's location, I've never had a bad experience here (compared to some other questionable locations I've been to ..)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-commack-2
Andrew C.,"Melville, NY",62,426,1257,3.0,7/30/2017,"It seemed to be a quiet Saturday when we arrived at this restaurant for lunch. Our granddaughter loved the corn dog so much that we had to order another corn dog lunch for her. The Black Bean Soup was good as well. But the server, Nick, was excellent and made sure we were enjoying our stay.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-commack-2
Ryan M.,"Greenlawn, NY",6,9,56,1.0,9/20/2017,Horrible place. Food is good but our food took an hour to come out (Not exaggerating) and our waiter Nick was never in sight and took half an hour to get us simple things like utensils. Did not want to ask for anything because each time it took like thirty minutes.. The service was so slow and the place is insanely COLD!!! Wish zero stars was an option.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-commack-2
Annie D.,"Commack, NY",94,15,1,2.0,2/16/2017,"Wonderful service, we had a fantastic waitress. Terrible food. Inedible steak, cold stale mozzarella sticks wilted salad. I could go on. We went on Valentine's Day, so they were a little busy, but still there is a standard. I won't be going back. Oh and weak weak drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-commack-2
Marie L.,"New York, NY",343,256,1268,2.0,1/19/2015,"Had dinner here after my 4 year old nephew chose Applebee's for his bday dinner. Decent food for your typical chain restaurant. They accommodated our large party which included four children. Our waitress provided great service, was friendly, and kindly allowed us to have three separate bills. The only negative was that although our table was pretty far from the front door, every time the door opened we felt a rush of cold air. Luckily we had sweaters to try and stay warm! For appetizers we ordered, fried string beans, boneless wings with Asian sauce, mild buffalo wings, mozzarella sticks, and pretzels sticks. Everyone enjoyed everything. I liked the appetizers at Applebee's better than when I had the sampler platter at Millers Ale house which is right across the street.  For entree the kids had meals from the children's menu. Pizza with a side of apples and yogurt dipping sauce. The pizza looked dried out an unappetizing. Thumbs down! Two of the kids ordered Mac and cheese, one with a side salad. Standard Mac and cheese, nothing special. The third child had chicken fingers with a side of yogurt. It came with three tiny and overcooked looking chicken fingers. Not very appealing.  Three adults ordered the cowboy burger. Everyone was satisfied, and they were cooked to order. I liked the choice between three different types of French fries (regular, bbq flavored, and sweet potato). I was pleasantly surprised that my burger tasted better than average.  For dessert we all had the cheesecake that was fried in a tortilla and topped with apples, ice cream and caramel sauce. It was good, not mind blowing bit good!  Overall, I was surprisingly pleased with our dinner at Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-commack-2
Adam B.,"New Rochelle, NY",3,39,6,3.0,2/17/2017,"I've been to this location a few times recently. I stopped going to Applebee's for a while because it tasted like one step above fast food, reheated and tasteless (thought I do like fast food once in a while). I would say they have improved a lot. I've had the 6oz sirloin as part of the 2-for-20 deal a couple of times and the cilantro lime chicken once. One time the steak was over cooked. They replaced it quickly and it was perfect. Decent sides. The mashed potatoes, I was surprised to hear, are from flakes, but somehow they make them taste pretty good. We have had the artichoke dip and wings for starters. Enjoyed both. My GF did think the mixed drinks were weak as another reviewer commented, so we usually have a beer. Our experience with the wait staff has been great. They are pleasant and friendly. We have never felt forgotten. A lot of their burger and entrees are very heavy so it is good to see the calorie counts on things. If you are watching you can make some better choices. Reality check Yelpers: this is Applebee's. Good for a family on a budget. Good for something fast, hot and tasty. If you want high end go to a place where the meals are $28 a plate not $10 to $20 per plate. You ca't compare this place to fine dining, but compared to other inexpensive bar & grill type places, it is not bad at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-commack-2
Rich S.,"Bay Shore, NY",0,12,,2.0,9/10/2016,Well another Applebee's I won't go to any more so sad I liked there food well service was horrible manager was even worse disrespectful dirty plates dirty table dirty throughout all I did was ask for a clean glass as there bbq sauce all over the side and bottom and waitress got nasty any way not worth elaborating just bad all around.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-commack-2
Emmanuelle L.,"CAMBRIA HTS, NY",0,2,,1.0,10/29/2016,"It's taken me a while to get around to this but it had to be done and I wish I could give this 0 stars. On October 23rd, a party of 8 went to eat at what we thought would be a fine establishment. WRONG! We arrived and waited an inordinate amount of time just to have our waitress, whose name was never given, to show up. Then she gave me a nasty attitude when I switched my drink for a non-alcoholic one when I realized I had misplaced my ID to prove I was legal to drink. Obviously if I heard you ask someone else in my party for ID to order an alcoholic drink, I wouldn't try to order one unless I knew I was legal to drink. So after her rude self left, we waited for 20 minutes to no avail of drinks, updates or anything while other parties that were seated after us, equally as big, received their drinks. Finally, Joseph the rude ""manager"" came over staring at our party as if we were in the wrong and just aggravated the situation. Finally my drink came, and no one else's, and it was a sloppy mess. The whip cream was deflated as if it had been sitting out for a while and was dripping down the side of the glass. I didn't even get a straw! Eventually my party left, feeling grossly discriminated against as we were the only people of color in a predominantly white neighborhood and the only ones in the restaurant. I will be writing to Applebee's HQ about this also.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-commack-2
Sabrina B.,"Commack, NY",1,3,,1.0,5/11/2017,I really wish I can give zero stars this place was a disgrace  there was no customers whatsoever  it wasn't busy at all and our waiter was a complete jackass he kept talking to the other people taking his sweet time and he realize we were there we were  waiting for about 10 minutes and he really got me mad so I said can someone please take our order and he rolled his eyes and said yeah give me a minute he left and never came back we were so confused. By then another lady came and she had an attitude. We placed an order and waited it took a little bit but we finally got the food. the food was fine but everyone kept staring at us and we want to complain to the manager but when we looked over we  saw the manager rolling his eyes and talking to the waiter we were originally going to have I guess... and pointing which is rude as hell. The service sucked I really wouldnt to go here I felt mistreated  and that I felt like the guy had a really bad day and just didn't want to deal with me I guess I didn't even have a big order all I asked was for the fucking classic combo that was really it and my friend got the same thing it wasn't really a hard order were just going to eat and leave but really The waiters fucking suck they probably live in a ONE bedroom apartment with her two cats really mad smoking cigarettes and drug dealing and when they come here they just realize oh shit my life piece of shit,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-commack-2
Phoebe H.,"Commack, NY",86,3,,1.0,5/7/2016,"The service was awful. Took forever to get drinks then by the time the waiter came back for our order the drinks were gone and she was no where to be found. The food orders were wrong. When my wings came out I immediately asked for extra sauce, never got it. When ordering we asked for extra sour cream, never came. The food was cold. I'm extremely disappointed with the whole experience and will never return to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-commack-2
Samantha K.,"Hicksville, NY",3,98,,2.0,12/19/2015,"I got dragged here by friends while out Christmas shopping in the area.  It was an ""off"" time ( 2PM on a weekday), so parking was a snap.   Nothing much doing customer wise, a few tables occupied, and three or four at the bar.      Service was friendly and fast.  My friends chose appetizers, which I did not try.  I had a chicken dish that sounded good on paper.  Grilled chicken with a garnish of apples, cranberries and walnuts.  Chicken has a weird consistency, and gave an after taste much like cold cuts.  I didn't feel that well for  a short time afterwards.       My friends ordered desserts, which they said were good.  I had a cup of coffee, which was very good.     Price was right, service good.  I'm going to try not going to this place again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-commack-2
Franco C.,"Oyster Bay, NY",828,2232,20,3.0,11/11/2012,"Chain food. I usually avoid chains- there are some exceptions and this is one that I would go to in a pinch.  I had been without power for about a week and really, really wanted something that wasn't out of a can- and Applebee's was open and serving hot food - perfect. I was veggie deprived so I ordered up a storm of food plus extra sides of veggies because my poor body just couldn't take any more peanut butter and tuna fish... The bartender was there when needed, the food came out exactly as described in the menu and the prices were moderate- perfect and left me in the frame of mind to go back again - but then I got power. So, one of the better chains, the place is a little too family oriented for me, but the food was fine as were the beers. Parking all around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-commack-2
Vanessa R.,"Centereach, NY",15,2,,1.0,9/6/2015,Service staff were not friendly. I can understand that the service staff do not clean the floor until the end of the night but tables and chairs have to be clean at the very minimum but apparently they weren't attentive enough for it. There was even flies on a table in front of the dirty one I sat at. Really disappointed because the Applebee's at Centereach was so much better. Service should be standardized and not sub-standard at various branches.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-commack-2
J. Keith K.,"East Northport, NY",0,17,6,3.0,4/28/2016,"About 10 years ago my wife got sick after eating at an Applebees and would never go back, which pretty much means i havent been to one either.  But, since I'm on the disabled list, ive been trying some new, and old places the last week or so.  This Applebees is literally everything you want in restaurant.  Tyler, my bartender was attentive and well trained.  He took care of everyone as soon as they sat, while staying engaged with those already there. He left those who wanted to be left alone, alone.  While talking to those who wanted conversation.  I had the wonton taco app which was really very good.  My entree was the grillhouse chicken or something like that, which was surprisingly good as well.  Now, when i go to a chain, i dont expect much, just a cheap meal.  But, this lunch was very good indeed.  While i was sitting there, the manager Cristi came over to do some register work.  While doing it she asked all at the bar if they were ok or needed anything.  Now that is a conscientious and engaged manager and you could tell it from the service given in the restaurant.  I could enthusiastically recommend this Applebees.  Very pleasantly surprised by this experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-commack-2
Sharesa J.,"Queens Village, NY",0,4,,1.0,10/23/2016,"I REALLY WISH I COULD GIVE  NO STARS! The service I received here was AWFUL. After my party of eight waited approximately 15 minutes for our server, who never stated her name, we waited another 20 minutes for our drinks. We asked to speak with the manager and was greeted by Joseph the EXTREMELY UNPROFESSIONAL manager. He came over and stared at us and opened his mouth and the first words that came out were ""You needed me""!!! HORRIBLE! We explained our situation and he never offered an apology for our TERRIBLE service! All the while we watched other tables receive their food and drinks. About five minutes later we were brought over a melting Pina Colada with deflated whipped cream ( I guess us EIGHT girls were supposed to share that one drink!). Needless to say we got up and left and were told by JOSEPH the manager ""You want to leave OK that's fine"" and he turned his back. Im sure you see why I need a negative star option.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-commack-2
Jack F.,"Huntington Station, NY",0,6,,4.0,11/15/2015,"Normally, I wouldn't write a review of a chain/franchise restaurant in this price category.  You know what to expect but we were pleased with the quality of the low calorie menu and the $20 for two selections (which we first experienced at an Appleby's in North Platte, Nebraska) were sufficiently varied. The grilled chicken was tasty - moist not overcooked.  The vegetables were fresh as were the salad greens. It's not gourmet but quite a good value for the money.  4 stars based on the price point of the restaurant and its exceeding expectations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-commack-2
Dylan D.,"Northport, NY",9,112,,3.0,5/10/2015,"I mean, let's face it- this is Applebee's, you've been to one you've been to them all and they're all equally as average. However, the big draw in this neck of the woods is the fabled half-off appetizers, which is a fun thing to undertake with a big group of friends to mix and match. But be aware, the Commack location is the confluence of a wide slew of high schoolers from much of the surrounding area, and when caught at the height of half-off apps you may find yourself the oldest- and quietest- person in the room fairly quickly. And service may naturally slow down as a result, though in my experience they've been pretty well prepared. So have your fun, but be warned- it may get uncomfortable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-commack-2
Amanda C.,"Commack, NY",40,39,6,5.0,8/24/2014,Oh Applebee's... Where to start?!? Half priced apps and twofers... Need I say more. The chicken nachos are awesome and that beer pretzel cheese appetizer is great as well.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-commack-2
Daanyaal K.,"Los Angeles, CA",486,603,183,4.0,1/1/2013,"Aside from their pointless Curbside to Go rule after 9 p.m, this location is one of the better Applebees in terms of service.
