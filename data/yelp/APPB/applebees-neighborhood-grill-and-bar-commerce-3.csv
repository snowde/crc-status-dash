Bruce A.,"Columbia, SC",0,27,,1.0,12/15/2017,"Bad Service, bad food ... choose someplace else to eat tonight.  Read below for long story. Service was very slow and unprofessional, not busy and not understaffed just really slow.   We waited to be seated for about 5 minutes hostess saw we were waiting but wanted to finish what she was doing first. Waitress did came by our table 10 minutes after we were seated to apologize but didn't take even our drink orders. We were there about 25 minutes before our drinks came and waitress took our order. Food was an overall miss but some was ok.   String beans hot and tasted good. The loaded  bake potato came out almost cold.  The butter and cheese was cold and the bake potato was not going to melt anything.  Guessing it was not freshly baked.  We waited long enough for it to have been baked. Got full rack of ribs, not as shown in picture.  Lengthwise ok but the ribs were cut long ways so that ribs were like 2 inches long. The waitress never came back after taking or order. No refills on drinks Don't know where everyone was hiding but we were not the only ones not getting service. Overall will not be going to Applebee's until I have forgotten this bad experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-commerce-3
Donna C.,"Jefferson, GA",1,15,2,5.0,11/11/2017,"Can't say enough nice things about our visit to this Applebee's on this Veterans' Day. Of course, the free meal, for my vet, was so generous; but the food was good and the service excellent! Thank you, Applebee's, for this special recognition of those who have served.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-commerce-3
J K.,"Sutherlin, OR",0,2,3,5.0,7/29/2017,"Good food and great, fast service. The bacon green beans are the stuff. Joey took great care of us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-commerce-3
Joe J.,"Baldwin, GA",0,4,,1.0,3/25/2017,"Terrible experience with the exception of our server.  Greeter prioritized cleaning a table over seating us. Ordered the ""Bourbon Street Steak"", medium. I received two pucks of over cooked (well done), vein riddled meat. Manager did not offer an apology and simply rambled on about how all of their steaks are cut in house. I'm not sure how that had anything to do with the cook or the quality of the meat. I simply asked for a cheeseburger instead. Server verified I wanted it cooked medium as well. Again, meat was over cooked and there were bits of bone n the patty.  Terrible quality of food, incompetent cooks {read: can't tell difference between medium and well done] and deluded manager.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-commerce-3
Laura B.,"Jefferson, GA",13,12,,1.0,2/11/2016,"Service has declined over past year. Today came in at 11 and there were 2-3 other tables in the restaurant. The waitress was slow. Appetizer was delayed due to manager had to ""thaw"" the sauces and our salad dressing. Our waitress brought our appetizer took it back then brought it back out saying the sauce was thawing. When sauce came it wasn't correct and tasted spoiled. The waitress began to freak out. The manager came out and explained the sauce tasted bad because it was sour cream. When our entrees came out my burger was raw. At this point I lost my appetite and didn't dare ask them to fix it because it would take forever. I decided to take my burger home and nuke it instead. I won't be back anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-commerce-3
Kent U.,"Orlando, FL",1,49,31,1.0,11/3/2014,"Worst experience ever!!!!!  Beware, you have been warned!!!!  I should have listened to the other bad reviews. 1) Hostess was not up front so we waited several minutes to be greeted. Then we were led to a dirty table that she later ""cleaned"" with dry paper towels.  2) Server was not all there and scatterbrained.  Very absent minded and messed up a lot of stuff. I asked for no mayo, and she said ""I have to grab it, so don't be upset if I don't see it when the food comes out. Not to worry, I will get my mayo"". I DONT WANT MAYO!!!  3) My Mushroom Swiss burger was missing.... You guessed it, Mushrooms. When we asked, we were told they are cooked in the meat. After tearing apart my burger for the manager we found two small pieces that he stated was 1/4 cup of mushrooms. HA!!! 4) Wife's burger was missing bacon. We got an ""I'm sorry about that"". Never even offered to give us the bacon. We did get offered a free dessert, which we declined, and no other concessions were made for our horrible experience.  5) Last, but not least, when we went to leave my son asked for a kids meal drink refill, to go. The server told us there would be an extra charge. What in the world!!!! Never again!!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-commerce-3
Nicole P.,"Flowery Branch, GA",29,31,,1.0,7/18/2015,Food poisoned from here. My husband and I shared a nacho appetizer and about 8 hours later we were both vomiting and very ill. Being as we are both food safety practitioners we would venture to say that their foods aren't being held to temp or are old. Don't go here. Good thing the kids didn't eat it,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-commerce-3
Sandra N.,"Atlanta, GA",0,18,,1.0,10/10/2015,racist!  This restaurant is racist. I didn't notice at the beginning but after being there for 15 mins I realized that we were sitting on the side with all the other color people while the rest of the restaurant was full of white people only.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-commerce-3
Fran S.,"Marcus Hook, PA",372,8,2,1.0,5/28/2015,Service was terrible.   I think bartender was drunk.     INSANE loud inside.   I got the ribs.   Seemed like they were being cooked since last week.   Same with the fries.    Food was just down right terrible.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-commerce-3
Joseph P.,"Greenville, SC",1,6,5,4.0,10/24/2015,"We were coming home from New Orleans and decided to stop at the Tanger outlet stores, went to this Applebee's and wow kinda impressed not necessarily the food, the service was absolutely great. People very nice and accommodating. Recommend this one!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-commerce-3
Kirk H.,"Madison, GA",6,6,,3.0,3/18/2015,"Not the greatest at serving probably because of age most servers young and some rude , foods OK not great been to other apple bees with great food and service , but if you are just out for a dinner date and something to do in area . it will do . loud and rushed atomisphere .....prices are good....just need to work on serves at this one.......",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-commerce-3
Nathan P.,"Hot Springs National Park, AR",55,81,,5.0,2/28/2014,"Great Applebee's location! Friendly staff, excellent good! I love their Fiesta Lime Chicken. It just gets better every time! This is one of my favorite Applebee's locations in North Georgia. Better than the Applebee's in Arkansas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-commerce-3
Mark E.,"Commerce, GA",0,4,,1.0,11/14/2013,"I would not recommend this place to anyone.  I've been here several time and the food is has always been substandard and the service lacking. I went there for the last time the other night, it was the worse experience we've ever had and I thought it had been bad before. I wont go in detail but lets just say that we left before eating our entree.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-commerce-3
H T.,"Apex, NC",0,7,,1.0,6/5/2014,"Wish I could review the food. I walked in and walked right back out.  I checked into a nearby hotel and went to the well know National chain because everyone knows that well known National Chains are always consistent.  When the doors opened all could hear was a very loud static sound. I soon realized that the sound was some guy screaming into a microphone. It was some kind of music that I have heard in late night head banger bars in new Orleans but NEVER in a family restaurant. I told the friendly lady working there that there was no way i could eat with that kind of noise, she smiled and said she did not blame me.  If this is normal entertainment, I'm sure most family's avoid this place.  If I owned this location, I would question my decision making.  So, I ended up eating a gas station sandwich and this Applebee's lost my money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-commerce-3
Paul D.,"Commerce, GA",0,3,,5.0,1/29/2014,"My food was very good, waiter was adorable and very friendly. My mom loved her dish and how well prepared it was. We came in a bit late but they never once acted mad at us or even asked us to leave.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-commerce-3
Kathy T.,"Spring Valley, NY",44,65,1,3.0,3/16/2011,"This was a mixed bag. My full rack of ribs were awfully undercooked- not raw but tough. I cooked the leftovers longer at home and they were actually very good. My other half had a steak and shrimp combo that he raved about.  Our server made the night. Her name was Aeryal (if I spelled it right) and she was the BEST. Unfortunately, she was getting obvious displeasure signals from the floor manager because she was spending ""too much time on our table""- we could hear him. Hello? There were 5 tables occupied in the entire place, and at least 4 servers on the floor at the time. Yes, we took up her time. And yes, we were paying for it. She also made up for a lackluster meal for me, and enhanced a good meal for him. Isn't that what she's supposed to do? Bottom line: management has some skewed ideas about what people expect or are going to get at table here. Staff gets an A; kitchen a C= and management?  An F.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-commerce-3
