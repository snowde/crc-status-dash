Kita N.,"Atlanta, GA",55,151,378,3.0,10/3/2016,"...I mean it's Applebee's - you can't go in there expecting a gourmet meal. I've been to this particular location plenty of times when I visit family Covington. The food is consistently decent - cooked well, flavorful, no major complaints. Is it the best Applebee's that I've been to? No. Is it a decent meal for the price? Yes.  In my experience, the service is good. I would caution you to not go here solely for cocktails at the bar. I would stick to well drinks and beer. The cocktails are really really watered down and just not worth the effort or the cost. This particular location is very family-friendly, so on the weekends you can expect to see lots of large groups.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-covington-10
Andrew F.,"Conyers, GA",0,14,16,1.0,10/25/2017,"4 words. SAVE YOUR D#MN MONEY. Don't take my word for it. Check out the $1 margaritas(Sour Juice) or try the all you can eat chicken tenders where they bring you 6 with a few fries, then 3 literally with less fries. No wonder they're losing busy. Oh, and most of all, the slow @ss service. Try it at your own risk. Is there a negative star Yelp?????",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-covington-10
Sandi B.,"Monticello, GA",24,6,,1.0,5/6/2017,"I told myself not to come back.. decided would try it again and wasn't disappointed. Food was subpar, husband got his food 10 minutes before mine and his was cold on arrival.  Was told upon checking in that the kitchen had requested people be made to wait because they were behind in the kitchen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-covington-10
Kríssy R.,"Social Circle, GA",4,4,1,2.0,6/28/2016,I live in Atlanta but have family in Covington and when I come To visit we sometimes order Applebee's always to go ..I always thought the food was kinda weird and Mediocre  I usually order the same thing steak veggies and potatoes mashed  I went in placed my order .. The menu looked different the food actually looked good! The design of the menu looked to be upgraded and new things were added :)  So I thought maybe they got new management someone to come in to turn things around  Clearly not new cooks  They actual  quality of the steak was different much better ! BUT whoever cooked it complete FAIL  It was the driest steak I have ever had with no type of flavor and loaded potatoes mashed was very good  but cold !  I placed my order inside and waited which seem to take longer then usual but since I placed inside and waited I expect the food to be hot  Everything was luke warm when I got home biggest pet peeve fucking up a order and getting all the way home to realize it,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-covington-10
Shannon K.,"Hudsonville, MI",2,17,4,3.0,3/20/2017,I had the chicken oriental salad and it came out cold! Our server apologized and was super sweet about it though. I would say you can find better food options elsewhere though.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-covington-10
Danielle R.,"Daly City, CA",0,31,2,1.0,12/13/2016,Chicken tortilla soup was not soup. It barley came off my spoon when I picked it up. Was not good. Would not recommend this location. Also under staffed so the poor waitress was doing the job of 4 people.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-covington-10
Kasey C.,"Austin, TX",78,11,2,2.0,6/15/2016,The service was horrible and the food was mediocre. We waited 5 minutes for a table. There were hardly any people in the place (Wednesday night). Waited about 20 minutes for our appetizer. We got spinach and artichoke dip. It wasn't even hot so I sent it back. We ended up getting our food and still no appetizer. I told the waitress I didn't want it anymore. My dad asked for his steak medium and it was cooked the same as my sister's which was supposed to be medium well. He also did not recieve a steak knife. My mom got her food about 10 minutes after everyone else. This is just not good business.  Let's just say I will not be returning to this establishment anytime soon.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-covington-10
Taylor J.,"Conyers, GA",0,4,3,2.0,5/20/2016,"This is no surprise considering how many terrible reviews this place has, but it's insane how little everyone cares here. Waited five minutes to be greeted, drinks were empty for awhile, appetizer salads came on plates so small the salads were falling off of them, food was very sub-par for a thirty minute wait on a pretty slow night. Our server was okay, she was friendly enough but did the minimal amount of work she could get away with. Seriously do not understand how they are still in business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-covington-10
Jerry C.,"Chapin, SC",16,161,36,4.0,9/6/2015,"It's against my policy to rate a chain this high, but we were very happy with our meal. My whole family ordered steak, and I thought they were making a mistake. But I tried some of theirs, and I was impressed. Okay, not the same as a quality steakhouse, but the meat was tender and tasty. I had a cheeseburger with bacon and pickle seared into it, and cooked just above medium. Very good burger! The service was good; friendly waitress. I don't do Applebee's often, so maybe we got lucky?  Good restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-covington-10
Ronald M.,"Blythewood, SC",134,10,,2.0,12/22/2015,Took over 20 minutes for for anybody to see us once we were seated. The food was served 40 minutes later Lukewarm and I finally left. Maybe that's how they treat customers in the big city,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-covington-10
Liza H.,"Port Charlotte, FL",0,7,,1.0,6/26/2016,"The service has been terrible since the place opened. It survives merely on it's name and I'm guessing off the highway trade. Because of this we have decided to try the ""to go"" method. The first time my husband went in, ordered and left. He didn't check the bag...how complicated can packing an off the menu order be? Standard with my order comes pico de gallo. NOPE. Next time we did the call in for pick-up and I specifically said please don't forget the pico de gallo. Husband got there 20 minutes later, the order wasn't ready. Waited another 15 minutes, got the food left. Pico de gallo??? NOPE. Third time, I ordered off the internet, completely changing the dish I usually order that never comes with the pico de gallo it says it comes with. This time I got the oriental grilled chicken salad, with an oriental type dressing and sliced almonds. Specified curbside delivery within half hour. Off goes husband. When he got there with order number in hand it had not even been started on. When he got it home, I looked at my salad and wow, it looked good. Except there was NO dressing at all, either on the side or on the salad and not a single almond to be found. Please don't go to this place, they really don't need to be in business. Maybe if we all stop settling for their lack of caring the place will close and someone else who CARES will open up a decent restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-covington-10
Sara L.,"Cumming, GA",1,7,4,1.0,7/21/2014,"The service SUCKS! Had a table of 6 , we waited 1 hr for our appetizers. Food was terrible. Never going back , that's for darn sure!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-covington-10
Peggy T.,"Oxford, GA",4,24,,1.0,6/22/2013,"I can't remember the last time we had such terrible service.  Even after the manager said she would be taking care of us, our iced tea glasses remained empty.  Come on now, it's June, it's hot, we're thirsty.  The queso dip appetizer came with a minute bowl of dip and a kazillion chips.  Our entrees were fair.  The manager did offer us a compliimentary dessert, but we declined, just over it.  She did comp our appetizer.  Never again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-covington-10
Ziggy S.,"Atlanta, GA",7,81,,1.0,5/2/2013,"I have never had a good experience at any Applebee's, but for some reason, my kids like it so I go on rare occasions. Yet again, another disaster. At this location, it took 45 minutes for our food order to be taken. The place was only about 1/3 full for lunch. After about 30 minutes, I decided not to ask for help just to satisfy my curiosity over how long it would actually take. So, no matter how bad my kids crave Applebee's, we're not going - I mean it this time, darn it! I'll just give them the money we would have spent and have PB & Js instead. They would definitely be better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-covington-10
Obione F.,"Conyers, GA",3,39,9,1.0,7/5/2014,"I first came to this Applebee's in Covington Georgia when I brought my granddaughters. Unfortunately, it was the worst experience I have ever had . The appetizers we ordered were horrible, it took over 40 minutes to get our meal and the waitress told me the wrong cost for the special. I had to get my money back. The other day on the fourth we went to Applebee's and that was a mistake. The food we order was incorrect, the size of the order was small, and the waitress and manager had every explanation under the sun, including they were fighting in the back. That was too much information. I would never go there again and am surprised that they have anyone that goes there. If you like Applebee's go elsewhere!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-covington-10
Duke M.,"Newborn, GA",11,10,10,1.0,4/30/2014,"We were seated quick enough but once out waitress got to the table she said very loudly ""Coke,tea,water"" not hello my name is or how can I serve you today just a shout at us in a weird kind of question. Then I ordered ribs and I ordered a full rack. It came our as 7 rib bones. I told my waitress that that is only a half rack and she got the manager who then proceeded to argue with me that it was a whole rack. It could not have been cause it was cut in the middle of the rack where the ribs are thickest. I know because I used to get the ribs every time I went there. After a much to long argument she says ""whatever"" and they change my bill. Well then she ( the manager ) goes to the bar and sits and stares at me the rest of the meal. I will never eat At this location again. Between a rude waitstaff and a power tripping manager I would rather eat out of the trash than give this location any money. Go to bojangles it is right next door.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-covington-10
R. N.,"Covington, GA",4,15,,2.0,8/5/2015,"I really don't know what has happened to this place in the last few months, the service is hit or miss and the food is too. Phoned in an order for a takeout on Monday 8/3  and the young lady who took my order told me, when I asked her to tell the chef no pink on my well done steak, that basically she wouldn't have to because if the steak is well done there want be any pink. When I got the steak home I had to microwave it on high for 2 minutes to get it done. There was a reason for me requesting this based on a previous dine in visit in which after sending the steak back once I elected to get a carry-out tray and take it home to finish cooking the steak. The service at least on this day was poor, I had to wait an additional 15 minutes after arriving to pickup my food with no communication from anyone after being asked at the bar if I was a dine in or takeout, not even a someone will be with you in a moment. To top the visit off the server went to the door looking for my vehicle when it was finally ready even after me informing her that I would come in to pickup my order. I usually tip 20% when dining in and a $1 even when I come inside to pickup a carry out meal, I thanked the server and left something I've only done once before for poor service. I don't think I'll be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-covington-10
Dennis J.,"Lithonia, GA",0,82,20,3.0,7/20/2012,"We had a large party (12) maybe that's what confused our waitresses. Adults & teenagers, not arranged by family. My wife & I got the 2 for $24; we both ordered the 9 oz sirloin w vegetables & baked potato. When my steak came to the table, it was tiny. The waitress tried to convince me it was 9 oz, but 2 others at our table got the same thing & theirs was double the size of mine. I had to get the manager involved. She made it right & my 2nd steak was 9 & then some. My wife was still waiting on her 1st steak. My son's Philly Cheesesteak had hair in it! That went back and was replaced and taken off the bill. My other son's food was fine. I give the mgr credit for her efforts, but the waitresses made it hard on themselves by over-complicating the order. When all our bills came to the table, they were all incorrect & had to be recalculated. If not for the manager, 1 star would have been all they got. I have eaten here before without problems, so I hope this is not a trend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-covington-10
