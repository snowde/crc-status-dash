Aleta P.,"Destin, FL",16,25,28,4.0,11/2/2017,"It was fine. Your typical Applebees. The only thing that stands out is that at the end when you pay on the little mini kiosk, it said to ask the waiter for a receipt and she gave some total bill type receipt instead of the usual itemized receipt you normally get and I wondered if I was over charged.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-crestview-3
Lola G.,"St. Petersburg, FL",43,32,10,2.0,1/4/2018,"This location is sub par.  Slow service, slow kitchen. I would say the staff is rude but they're now very friendly either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-crestview-3
J W.,"Crestview, FL",0,14,3,1.0,9/23/2017,This place use to be good many years ago. I came bsck into town and decided to try again. I sat at the bar while a very disgruntled bartender moved about aimlessly....it was so sad. After exactly 8 minutes of her not paying any attention to anyone new at her bar I left.  Will never return....,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-crestview-3
Nancy C.,"Fort Walton Beach, FL",28,22,10,1.0,10/29/2017,"I have a soybean oil allergy and called to see what type of oil they used in the kitchen and was told ""I don't have time to get up and go check but you can check our allergen menu online"". I told her it was not accurate. She replied ""I don't have time to check."" I hung up. That is costumer service at its finest. I have never been told this. Another loss for Applebee's. No wonder the star rating is so low for this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-crestview-3
Courtney W.,"Fort Walton Beach, FL",0,25,7,3.0,9/28/2017,"My food is always great, BUT it's always freezing in there! And the lighting is just awful. There was a table of four elderly people struggling to read their menus, complained about the lack of light over their table (and let me tell you, it was dark) and the waitress didn't even move them. I felt awful watching it happen. Maybe try to fix the lighting to be brighter so your customers can enjoy their meals and company better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-crestview-3
Kathy B.,"Orlando, FL",0,18,2,1.0,4/24/2017,"I don't know how this Applebee's stays open. I foolishly ignored the low ratings and went anyway. The problem is bad food and even worse management. I was served my very first inedible Caesar salad. I didn't think that was possible!  Super thick, sour dressing that was so heavy you couldn't taste the lettuce. After sending it back was served a raw burger. It wasn't even rare! Cold, raw meat. The manager ran and hid. No apology, nothing! The only positive thing I can say is that our server was great. She was so embarrassed at the kitchen and management. I felt bad for her. Stay away. Applebee's corporate please come re-vamp this location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-crestview-3
Joe G.,"Crestview, FL",9,6,,5.0,9/21/2017,"Valerie was the nicest waitress I've ever had. I will be coming back and specifically asking for her section if she is working ! The food is also good cant go wrong with anything.

Mary F.,"Greenfield, OH",39,4,,3.0,7/8/2017,I went to Applebee's last week when I was in Florida visiting a friend. The food was really good but the staff wasn't that great. I found them very rude.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-crestview-3
Andrea M.,"Hinesville, GA",13,11,,4.0,5/16/2017,I have been to this Applebee's a few times. Each time that I've gone I've had very nice servers and food that was served hot and true to the Applebee's brand. I have not had any issues with waiting. Then again when I go out to eat I believe that is about enjoying the environment and people that I'm with. It's not about expecting food to be thrown out at me. So maybe if it did take a while I didn't notice because I was too busy enjoying my company. I do enjoy eating here and only took one star off because of Applebee's menu itself and that's not something this location can change.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-crestview-3
Kao S.,"Crestview, FL",131,2,,1.0,8/8/2017,"So check this - my wife and I  decided to go to Applebee's Grill & Bar in Crestview, Florida. We get seated and the restaurant doesn't seem too busy so we are expecting it to be fairly fast since it's just two of us. As we wait for our waiter more customers start to come in and they are being served before us, I didn't think much of it i thought maybe my server is dealing with something. 10 minutes go by and more customers are being seated and served before us. Another 5 minutes go by and still no waiter... I look around me and angela is the only two minority in the whole restaurant and I'm not saying they are racist or nothing I'm sure they didn't mean to forget about us. But 25 minutes without a server come on! Do better Applebee's Grill & Bar I didn't even get a water!!! 25 minutes in and nothing!!! I'm Never going back there everrr!!!  Honestly I only stayed the whole 25 minutes to see how long they will take to get to me. Oh and I was walking out there were 2 waiters/waitresses standing by the door. Lmao",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-crestview-3
Heaven A.,"Fort Walton Beach, FL",0,32,20,1.0,4/18/2017,"One word. BLAND. I got their 3-cheese chicken cavatappi  pasta and it was bland. Chicken, cheese, sauce, everything was just bland. It had no flavor whatsoever. I had to dump a crap load of Parmesan cheese and salt on my pasta to make it tolerable. The Applebee's in Destin is way better. Don't waste your time here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-crestview-3
Glen J.,"Crestview, FL",5,11,,4.0,3/1/2017,"I never understood the low ratings this place receives. We eat there frequently and are seldom dissatisfied. The menu changes frequently giving new variety, the servers are more than competent, and the food is dependably tasty and well prepared.  I'll continue to enjoy and wonder about the bad reviews.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-crestview-3
Angelia B.,"Crestview, FL",16,10,1,1.0,4/9/2017,"This was by means the worst visit yet!  Got seated and sat there a good 10 minutes waiting on someone to take our order. By the way they weren't busy. I could see 3-4 workers keep looking around the corner. I finally asked a guy was he our waiter and he said no, Carissa is. He said I told her nine times to come over and he would go tell her nine more times. She finally came over got our order which included a bar drink. She brought our teas and never got the bar drink. She was over there laughing with the bartender. He never made the drink. So we decided to go somewhere else!!  Beef O'Bradys it is!  So, if u happen to go there, don't get Carissa.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-crestview-3

Apryl J.,"Crestview, FL",1,3,,2.0,4/14/2017,Applebee's is getting bad. There where 16 tables open and we had to wait 20 mins to be seated. To top it off the hostess seated people that came in after we did and they where her friends. The management team is not friendly at all.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-crestview-3
Lissette O.,"Niceville, FL",228,2,,1.0,5/26/2016,"If there was a possibility of putting negative stars that is what I would have done.  A. WE WOULD LIKE OUR STEAKS WELL DONE. We got 4 very red steaks 1 hr after ordering then once they took them back to cook them properly not only were they still not fully cooked but they switched all the steaks around. Mark the meat so that grandma dosnt get lil johnnys cut up squares. B. Cheese potatoes NEED CHEESE!!!!! Sliced potatoes with sour cream and 6 STRANDS of cold cheese does not count.  C. Shrimp asian salad...... Did you buy a bag of mixed greens from the walmart across the street, throw 3 shrimp on it and call it Thai salad??  D. What canned brand were those sweet potato gravy thing you served us? Id like to know what kind to avoid when grocery shopping.  E. Grilled zucchini should be grilled all the way through. I understand your confusion with that since the steak wasnt properly grilled either.  F. Mixed veggies SHOULD BE MIXED VEGGIES. Not cold zucchini and some peppers. G. MY MOM DIDNT WANT RICE OR POTATOES!!!! She asked for green beans. So if she corrects you then you should kindly correct the order that you did not place correctly. H. Why would you sit 7 people at a 4 person table? Not just that but was selina playing the ""how many dishes can we stack on the table"" game?  I. If youre in a rush or hungry, DO NOT STOP HERE.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-crestview-3
Ronald B.,"Crestview, FL",15,49,167,4.0,11/9/2015,My wife and I went on Monday because their burgers are $6.99 from 4pm to closing. We wanted to try the burgers and we were impressed. My wife had the blazen Texas burger with sweet potato fries. She didn't care for the pull pork on the burger because it was to sweet. She loved the burger and fries. I had the triple bacon burger with fries. The burger was real juicy. I had to use two napkins. The burgers were great for $6.99 but I think they are a little overpriced for their regular cost of $10.99. We had great service from Andrew K. Give them a try on Monday.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-crestview-3

Arika A.,"Honolulu, HI",0,1,,1.0,9/25/2016,"Service was horrible, waitresses need training and to learn how to be presentable.  Food was undercooked or over cooked...not impressed and will not be going back.  Manager needs to mingle in dining area more to check on customers.  I remember when it was always packed but I see now why it isn't anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-crestview-3?start=20
Debbie J.,"Milford, CT",3,8,1,3.0,1/4/2016,"Food was alright. We went for burger Monday. They asked us simple pink or no pink and somehow even tho I asked for pink and my fiancé asked for no pink, I got absolutely no pink (which ruins a burger for me) and he got a little pink.  That added our waitress did not smile once. She was efficient and always brought out new refills and such but a little common courtesy and kindness and genuinity would have gone a long way. Also we waited twenty minutes while there was like 5 open tables and other people waiting so kind of annoying. They give you tons of mozz sticks tho!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-crestview-3?start=20
Matt G.,"Fort Walton Beach, FL",4,21,8,5.0,2/4/2015,"Clearly there's been a change in leadership at this location...the previous reviews point to rampant apathy among the serving staff and inattentiveness...however, my family experienced quite the opposite. We went to the Bayou Blvd. location in Pensacola and had one of worst experiences ever from a chain. I left a review on that one if you want to look at it for an idea. The district manager contacted me and addressed all my concerns accordingly and indicated he would make it mandatory for servers to write down orders going forward, and to emphasize the importance of accuracy. This Crestview location was OUTSTANDING. Even the food quality was night and day compared to the Pensacola location, which only leads me to believe whoever is hiring there is clearly doing it wrong -- call the Crestview folks and see how they're doing it, because it's working. The staff all kept coming to our table to play with our son and really made us feel welcome, which isn't something you see out of most chain restaurants. We will definitely be back here, and we now understand why this place is always so packed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-crestview-3?start=20
Leigh J.,"Athens, AL",5,5,4,3.0,7/7/2014,"We've eaten at Applebee's many times, it's always good. Our meal last night however wasn't that great! I ordered the quesadilla burger, which I normally love! It was so salty I couldn't eat it. Service was lousy!! & they were not very busy.

Kathy S.,"Rapid City, SD",17,70,1,1.0,12/29/2014,"While visiting the area, we've eaten here 4 to 5 times in the past 3 years. We keep hoping the manager has changed or the franchise has swooped in to fix the mess. The server's apathy is never a disappointment. They hang out in the back and never seem to come back. The food has been good most of the time, but takes absolutely forever to come to the table. We've finally given up. If the help is that lax in public, what's going on with the cooks in the kitchen? We're out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-crestview-3?start=20
Mery V.,"Crestview, FL",0,4,6,4.0,11/6/2015,"Very Good appetizer. They had a special for house margaritas, very cheap and big glasses; tasted really good .

Robin P.,"DeFuniak Springs, FL",2,1,,1.0,4/6/2015,Went here for Easter dinner. This has never been my favorite place but hubby likes it. Food portion is now half of what it was a month ago. My oldest daughter got the penne pasta. Bottom of bowl was covered that was all. Bread sticks were hockey pucks. Same with the hubby's mac n cheese dish. Youngest got 3 tiny chicken fingers. Mother in law barely got a side dish. My steak was over cooked and the shrimp was pure rubber. When we complained the waitress burst into tears and the manager Scott was rude and condescending. Told us to complain on the website. That's my next stop. Will NOT be back!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-crestview-3?start=20
Ashley W.,"Crestview, FL",0,10,,3.0,1/28/2016,"The food is good. The won ton tacos are absolutely delicious. The service is hit or miss depending on the server you get. However, one persistent problem is the heating/air conditioning. Apparently they have to send an email to someone to get permission to turn the AC down, and whoever is giving this permission must intend to turn the customers into decorative ice cubes. I understand some restaurants do this to cause people to eat faster, but it causes us to not want to dine there at all except in the cold winter months, when they have at least a little heat and even though it's still cold, at least the cold air isn't being blown on you while you're trying to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-crestview-3?start=20
Boo L.,"Fort Walton Beach, FL",10,203,4,1.0,4/15/2014,"I'm giving up on this location. I am tired of the apathy displayed by employees on all levels, to include management.

Angeles W.,"Buford, GA",118,199,242,2.0,5/29/2011,"We've eaten here quite often, and enjoyed our meal once. Chain food is fairly reliable when it comes to flavor, so I felt comfortable coming her after establishing a good relationship with another location a few years ago. I quickly fell out of my comfort zone.  The food is extremely inconsistent. One day we'll eat there and everything will be great, and then we'll come several more times and it will be dry, or unflavored, or undercooked, or just plain bad. We keep returning because we keep getting gift certificates from family for holidays and birthdays. We aren't likely to ever spend cash eating here, though. The sweet tea is seriously lacking in flavor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-crestview-3?start=20
Joe L.,"Colorado Springs, CO",29,16,,1.0,4/8/2013,"You know the menu and decor.  The only reason this one is still open at all is because Crestview, FL has no other sit down restaraunts in town.  Other than that there is no reason to go back.  The service has been lousy everytime we visit.  The food is ok when you get it.  Last time we went they forgot my son's meal and blamed it on the cook.  It took another 20 minutes to get him a corn dog out to the table!  No apologies, no discounts nothing.  We will never go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-crestview-3?start=20
Meredithe M.,"Bisbee, AZ",30,120,179,3.0,7/31/2013,Typical Applebees.  The service was good and it wasn't too crowded.  Their menu has a little bit of everything and the kids like it.  The wedge salad was yummy!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-crestview-3?start=20

Service is slow, food is cold, tables are still sticky from the previous diners, hair in my drink, and the list goes on. We have been there several times but our returning has drastically declined as the service and quality has. The staff is friendly enough, though they don't know how to handle situations properly, like when there was a hair in my mixed drink. The waitress went ""Ew"" and took it back, only to bring me another one where there was a hair in the strainer. At that point I gave up. I complained to the manager but my concern was just shrugged off. Still left the waitress a tip, after all, she wasn't the one mixing the drinks.
