Liz H.,"New Milford, CT",0,4,,3.0,10/17/2017,"I love to come to Applebee's, but I have to say Applebee's in Danbury is just so so. The main problem is the food and quality of service can not be guaranteed. Sometimes I stop by with my friends, the food taste differently than I had in other location. Sometimes food taste over cook or getting cold. One of waitresses we had many time she just never get better, every time when we see her we always wish best luck. Hope the manager can improve the service quality!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-danbury-2
Sue S.,"Danbury, CT",0,6,,1.0,7/13/2017,"Almost never review restaurants, but had to make an exception here.   Simply put everything was terrible.  Food, service, even the attitude of the staff was just short of rude.  Also want to warn you of their fund raising pancake breakfasts.  How can you screw up breakfast?  Raw bacon, rubbery pancakes and sour orange juice.  Have been to 3 different breakfasts to support different schools, bands and whatnot, but now I know to eat at home before I arrive.  Next time I'll save my time as well and just give the organization cash so I don't have to get up at the crack of dawn on a Sunday.   You've been warned :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-danbury-2
Karen L.,"Putnam County, NY",12,251,424,2.0,12/28/2017,"It is a typical Applebees. Not much to say since the food is pretty standard. The crispy Oriental chicken salad is delish as always. The wait is long, the waiter has snarky answers when you request stuff. Once, it was freezing from the AC so we asked if we could sit in another section and he pretty much told us it was closed so we had to stay in that one little section. We couldn't deal with the frigid AC so we told him that we would have to leave and he could care less.  Customer service could improve. They lost out on business that day and the restaurant was pretty empty too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-danbury-2

Pam Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,27,1,1.0,11/5/2017,I used to love Applebee's as almost every meal was a great alternative to the last. The food is still great but this is the third time that the service was beyond bad. After waiting 15 minutes for the server to take our drink order it toon another 10 to bring us water - still no drinks. And another 10 for the drinks. This has happened over and over. It appears to be understaffing so I don't blame the waitress but this will be the last time we come here unless management addresses the issue.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-danbury-2
Danny B.,"Norwalk, CT",3,162,,5.0,10/15/2017,Applebees is Pretty good I see all the Reviews here were all pretty much Previous Years If there was bad Service in the Past they probably have Improved my first time there it was good the Service was good they had a Margarita Deal $1 Dollar for the Month of October I thought that was good they serve Burgers Chicken Sandwhich's Tacos great for the Kids they have a Kids menu not a meat eater no problem they have Seafood as well and Salads and other Options would go back again the food was good,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-danbury-2
Mike P.,"Danbury, CT",213,192,30,2.0,12/20/2015,"Haven't been to one of these since like high school, but we were all heading to the movies for the new Star Wars (awesome by the way) and figured this was the most reasonable place to grab food. Got seated right away and our waitress came over and took drink orders. Tap list wasn't anything fancy, I think the most craft they had going for them was Sam Adam's seasonal. As long as it's not Bud Light, thanks. We placed our orders in and received them about 10 minutes later, turnaround was pretty solid. I got a chicken piadini (still unsure of what that means) sandwich that wasn't bad, but there was WAY too much lettuce instead of chicken. The ratio was like 3:1, not even kidding. For payment they have this tablet on every table that tallies up your bill and when you're done eating, you can pay in full or divvy up the items for separate checks. Then you pick which bill to pay for and swipe your credit card to pay. It's actually really cool, especially for Applebee's. Why hasn't any other restaurant tried doing this yet? Seriously. All in all, not a bad experience, but not my first choice for restaurants. Could be better for happy hour, I wouldn't know, and probably never will. Pre-movie viewing though, I'll take it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-danbury-2
Better B.,"Bethel, CT",3,205,2,1.0,7/16/2016,"Been a year and a half since our disastrous visit and we dropped in hoping to find a pleasant experience awaiting us. Walked in for a late dinner, no line, cool! No host or hostess either. Waited nearly five minutes as a few staff members came to the station and grabbed or dropped something off and went elsewhere. No, ""hello"" no effort to seat us. Hostess finally shows up, half the restaurant is empty, she says to wait. Walks down the South side, looking around, comes back, says sorry, wait another minute, walks around the north side, gets half way around and starts chatting with a waitress....for a while......then disappears into the bac k.  No issues at Chili's, try the Sunrise Burger. Danbury Applebees has become the repeat punishment for no particular crime.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-danbury-2
Cory P.,"Danbury, CT",3,20,15,2.0,4/10/2016,"The last 3 visits to this location have been an incredible disappointment.  I don't come here for gourmet food, so if they can't at least get the service right, that's a nonstarter. My main issues are that the place is chronically understaffed and the food is sub par.  Today, it didn't come out cooked the way I asked.  I asked for medium-rare on the steak and it came out well done.  I ordered a Bud Light and I can see it sitting over at the bar for 15 min before its ever served.  After finishing the meal, I sat there with dirty plates in front of me for a minimum of 20 minutes.  On today's visit, the servers were ""negotiating"" when their breaks are going to be.  I don't need to hear that--figure that out in the back room. It's not just me either.  On the last 2 visits, there always seem to be tables near me that have even bigger problems than I do.  With the manager and server waiting on them hand and foot, that took even more resources away from my table.  All I heard that night was ""I'm sorry about that. We're having an off night.""  Okay, well recognizing the problem is a good start.  How about actually doing something about it? They need to close this place down for a few days, retrain everybody.. and I mean everybody, and try again. Update 11/16/17: sustained at 2 stars. Absolutely nothing has changed here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-danbury-2

Medha T.,"Westport, CT",90,2,1,1.0,9/9/2016,"The only thing worse than the slow, subpar service at this pseudo ""restaurant"" is the meat they cook claiming to be steak. We got 4 different steak dishes and each was worse than the last. So tough even the steak knife couldn't cut through it. We had to choke down with water, which wasn't offered at the beginning, we had to ask for it while trying to chew and even then had to wait 20 minutes for it. The alcohol tasted off, what little there was in our watered down cocktails. Finally, we hoped a bit of sweet dessert would at least end this experience on a positive note to put in our review, but...alas the triple chocolate cake was obviously frozen and microwaved and the accompanying ice cream had freezer burn.  I know it's a chain place, I wasn't expecting amazing flavor or cuts but this wasn't even edible and the fact our server was nowhere to be found, ever, even though place was less than 20% full.  And I paid for that.  Pros: fries were crispy and seasoned.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-danbury-2
Helena S.,"New Milford, CT",23,71,,2.0,2/22/2016,"It's truly unfortunate that the changeover in atmosphere at Applebees resulted in such a decline in the service.  Applebees used to be my family's go-to spot for birthday dinners and fun nights out together, however after my last experience there on Saturday, I will most certainly not be back. Upon entering the restaurant, we were not even greeted just brought to a table... at first I thought this was just the hostess being super attentive, but she had actually just assumed we were with someone else, so when the rest of the other party came in, we were moved to another table, which wasn't a huge deal, chalked it up to a silly mix up... We got set into our new table and started looking over the menu....  We were not greeted by our waitress until almost 10 minutes later. Now usually around rush time on a Saturday as a waitress myself, I could understand the delay, but it was almost 9:00pm, and the place was not that busy... the waitress came to take our drink order and was peeved that we wanted to place our entire order, as we did not want to wait for her to come back.... She took our order, and we waited another 10 minutes for our drinks (sodas) to come to the table...  About 20 more minutes passed before our appetizers arrived, but not to worry, because before we could even get someone to bring us plates for our appetizers, the entrees were right behind them... oh and our plates, had old crusty food on them, so I guess we shouldn't have asked for them. The food was great for us, no complaints. However while beginning to start our meal we noticed the table behind us getting loud and trying to get a server's attention.... almost 5 of them walked by without even being bothered... Turned out the table behind us had been giving moldy hamburger buns... not the greatest of news for us as 2 of our party had also ordered burgers. We finished up and waited for the waitress to return, however we pulled someone else aside to get boxes for the rest of our food... the waitress went by dropped our check on top of our dirty dishes and kept walking.... By far and away the most awful experience I have ever had. I tried to flag down the manager, but he was busy dealing with the moldy food issue, and we had already been there long enough... Awful service, no attentiveness, no politeness, no refills offered, and our table wasn't even cleared. We weren't even offered dessert. Will not be going back....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-danbury-2

Lauren B.,"Brookfield, CT",2,18,7,3.0,8/8/2016,"Recently came here for a late night dinner. They are open quite late on Saturday nights which is helpful if you want a bite to eat in the Danbury/Brookfield area. This visit receives 3 stars because the restaurant was hot and humid inside (it was cooler outside!) which makes for an uncomfortable eating experience. Also, my fiancé ordered the French onion soup and there was a hair in it. To the servers credit, she did everything to make up for it. HOWEVER, we still had to pay for it. Originally it was comped, but then was re-added to the bill. Pretty crappy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-danbury-2

Linda Q.,"Brookfield, CT",0,34,,2.0,1/2/2016,"I go here more for the drinks, not the food. It's so unhealthy! The service has never been an issue--if anything their staff was too big. Tonight, Dec 30, was awful! I would have complained to the manager--but didn't find him, either. I met my friend at a table in the bar area. No one came over to see if I wanted a drink. I would have gone to the bar & gotten it myself--but no one was tending bar, either! Finally we flagged someone down & ordered. We asked for water with our meal and it only came when we were finished eating. We waited forever for the check, got it and no one came to take it. I don't know if they were so short handed that they were all inside ""cooking"" or should I say ""nuking"" the meals. I scanned the restaurant & didn't see anyone waiting on tables. It was a 2 hr 15 min dinner experience. If you were there before catching a movie--you would've missed the movie! I won't be back unless I have 3 hours to kill.

Penny K.,"Bethel, CT",0,41,2,1.0,1/25/2014,"Food: a half-step above a mediocre diner.  Service: Awful. We (myself and 4 teens) came for an early pre-movie Saturday dinner. When we ordered (at about 6:25), I said that we needed to be out by 7 - yes, it would be tight, but the waiter said it shouldn't be a problem. Wings came out almost immediately. The waiters were all chatting at the bar, and 20 minutes later, still no food; the manager came over (after I asked when we could expect our meals), apologized and blamed the kitchen - he'd give us ""boxes"" if we wanted to take the food out. Food came as we were talking.  Bill came, and when asked for change of 3 $20's (we needed $10's for each person to pay), the waiter disappeared for at least 5 minutes; we could see him chatting again at the bar.

They don't even refill my drink or remember celery and when they bring it they forget the blue cheese and also didn't even take my card was too busy socializing with the people on the left side of me . I tried waiting and I ended up getting someone else to take the payment which is not normally what someone does since that person wasn't the same one that took the order in the first place. Even one of the workers there had told me this isn't the first time this has happened meaning this has been reoccurring and don't know why she hasn't been assigned another position its very unprofessional to have someone waiting to pay for their order and they are too busy being sidetracked.

When we kept asking our waiter what was going on he seemed clueless and we were even brought someone else's meal which we should have just eaten considering how long we waited for ours! We waited so long for this stupid salad and soup that we were starting to walk out until our waiter ran over and saw us wanting to leave and then assured us our meals were on their way. It still took awhile and we kept telling the waiter ""Where's our food? We really need to get back to work! IT'S JUST A SOUP AND A SALAD!"" Two items that are probably already prepared and just needed to be plated. We even joked to the waiter ""should we go get our own food?""

Indira P.,"Danbury, CT",0,35,5,1.0,11/26/2012,"Saturday before noon 11/24/12 prior to a movie we decided to stop by Applebee's and grab something to eat, so we ordered an appetizer sampler. The restaurant was not crowded, there were less than 3 tables occupied and we waited for 20mins for our food - not a big deal. When the food came it was wrong, we got 1 of the 3 appetizers we ordered and the table next to us got the other items, seems that the kitchen had a mix up, no biggie. The problem came when our waitress Cheryl took the food from our table and attempted to swap it with the table next to us.  I was not having that so we walked over to the bar asked for a manager and got two neither of which did anything; we were being charged for the food we did not even touch and for two sodas. We refused to pay and they insisted even after we told them what the waitress did. Needless to say we did not pay.

The first two experiences were fine but my last appearance made me realize why I don't care to go there anymore. My husband and I walked in and wanted to sit in a booth on the right hand side of the restaurant but the hostess told us the tables were dirty which was a lie. For some reason when we go there they always seem to place us on the left hand side of the restaurant. Which in my opinion seems like the nosier location. And the hostess picks and chooses whose best to sit on the right hand noiseless side. Besides that to make a long story short, After we ordered our meal I notice an advertisement of 3 alcohol drinks. The sign says, If your waiter/ waitress fails to feature these drinks to you, then you can get one of those drinks for free. I confronted the waitress about it and she told me those signs should've been off the tables. But the sign didn't have a specific time stating when the offer ended. Then as I look around, those signs were on every single table in the restaurant. She responded with us with an attitude as If she knew she was wrong for her response and reaction. It was very unprofessional. Her whole service was unprofessional and confusing as if she didn't seem to know how to react in front of customers. My meal came out which was good for having the sirloin, but i received the smallest scoop of mash potatoes as if that was the very last bit of it until they made a new batch. I asked for refill and we received it at the end of our meal because the waitress forgot all about it.
