Kristin L.,"Chicago, IL",541,248,1525,3.0,12/1/2017,"We could not find anywhere to eat on Black Friday after an exhausting day of shopping. All we wanted to do was sit down and be served immediately (other places, even Steak n Shake) had a 30+ minute wait. Luckily we called Applebee's down the street in Davenport while leaving Steak n Shake and there was not a wait. Our server was ok. She didn't have the timing down right in terms of when to check in on us.  I like this place for a chain because of the pictures on the menu; of course the items never come out as delicious as the professional photos make them seem. I ordered the lunch special for $10, decent, quality what I expected. My friend ordered a side of mac and cheese and a side mashed potatoes. The potatoes were supposed to come with cheese and bacon bits. My friend had to ask for both; they apologized and brought it back with shredded cheese straight from the fridge on it. Had to request send it back to be heated to melt the cheese and so the potatoes remained hot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-davenport-6
Chad T.,"Bonita Springs, FL",0,75,1,3.0,12/29/2017,"Stopped in for a late night drink after arriving in town. The bartender was good, but the drinks were about average. The pre-made long island ice tea was more bitter than anything, it would be nice to actually see a bartender make the drink.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-davenport-6
Christopher S.,"Davenport, IA",0,10,7,3.0,10/26/2017,"I like Appleby's especially the NEW 2-4-$20 menu!!  Melissa is a friendly and very organized waitress. Nice to see a manager jump in, when needed (the Red Hat Ladies had a gathering tonight ;)  Not a fan of the news station they had on is my only complaint, so next time probably wont sit in my preferred area, around the bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-davenport-6
Jeanne G.,"Carlock, IL",99,12,,4.0,7/27/2017,I like their half priced appetizers. We had Nachos n boneless wings. Good+ but not as spicy as I like. The beer n Long Island tea were good but not fabulous. Service particularly good n the manager helpful. I would go again and recommend you give it a try too.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-davenport-6
Diana P.,"Davenport, IA",0,1,2,5.0,8/11/2017,I highly enjoy the food and atmosphere each and every time that I go here. The people and servers they are so nice and so sweet. The food is always so delicious and so fresh. I could honestly eat at Applebee's all the time!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-davenport-6
Kayla B.,"Ames, IA",54,469,2509,2.0,1/11/2016,"Standard Applebees, but the service seems a bit weird. Our main waitress seemed really frazzled and busy. I'm not sure if they were overworking her or what. She did do a decent job getting us our menus, drinks, and taking care of the check though. It was a little longer than preferred, but it wasn't horrible. The weirdest part were the kitchen help. I'm not sure what's going on there, but they need to train them. Various kitchen staff tried to give me meals from other tables three times. Each time with different kitchen staff. The first time it happened, the two girls tried to force the food onto the table by saying ""this is what you ordered and I have receipts that prove it"". The second and third times, the kitchen staff just seemed a bit embarrassed by the mistake but took the food away without mention. Not once was an apology offered. It was really weird, and maybe they're training lots of new employees right now? At the end of the meal, we were also brought the wrong check. Another table received our check and mentioned it to the waitress who then switched around the checks. The food, however, was about what you expect from Applebees. Nothing great, but it's nothing horrible either. I'm glad that, for the most part, I know what to expect from every Applebees and I don't have to worry about differing food qualities when I come. It tastes like it does at almost every Applebees, so if you like the food, you'll probably be fine here. Not the worst service in the world but not the best either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-davenport-6
Jim R.,"Sherrard, IL",0,1,,1.0,7/19/2017,Waitress had a serious attitude problem. Food tasted ok but was seriously salty and unhealthy.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-davenport-6
Bob N.,"Moline, IL",0,10,2,1.0,9/23/2016,"First off, our waitress was friendly but she did not explain the half off appetizers correctly, we asked to have a variation of three, we ordered after 9 but still had to pay the 12.99 price instead of getting them half off, I asked her about it and she said she could only give me the single appetizer I ordered half off because the other was a trio. They are all on the same appetizer page, why because we ordered them together do we still not get them each half off? Also towards the end of our meal we were finishing up and noticed an ant crawling on my arm then I looked down at the window seal and there was a bunch more, SO gross!! I was not happy at all, maybe if they made sure the tables were clean and not so sticky they wouldn't have this issue. I will not be returning. I am so grossed out thinking about my experience tonight.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-davenport-6
Rich B.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",7,32,18,4.0,8/29/2015,"One of the better chain restaurants. This location is clean and well-staffed. The meals have always been tasty and made well,  so no complaints at all.  It's nearly always pretty full,  but my party has always been seated promptly. It really is sparkling clean,  and that's always a good thing!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-davenport-6
Mike H.,"Bettendorf, IA",0,24,,1.0,8/21/2016,"This is third time I've tried this Applebee's location, and the last time I'm going back until they replace the GM and fire the older blonde bartender. The service has always been poor. They seem more concerned with chatting with each other and ignoring the guests than doing their jobs. The quality was okay until this last visit. The idiot blonde bartender brings my wings out of the kitchen and when I picked up the first one the sauce was cold. Then I felt the chicken meat and it was literally refrigerator cold. As I waited for them to remake the wings, no manager came over to apologize and take care of me, and after waiting for far too long, I just left. This Applebees should be closed by corporate, it's a disgrace to the other Applebee's I've visited.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-davenport-6
Ronnie B.,"Rockwall, TX",52,256,621,4.0,3/11/2014,"Server: Alicia  Shift: Lunch Menu selections: 2 for $20/Steak, steamed vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes and spinach dip.  My mother and I went here yesterday for lunch. I must say that everything was wonderful. Our waitress Alicia was kind, informative, humorous and quick on her feet considering she was 7 months pregnant. My mother is such a picky eater, so when she told me she liked Applebee's I was floored. So, now that where she wants to dine all the time. :) As long as she is happy so am I.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-davenport-6
Lianne N.,"Davenport, IA",39,198,63,2.0,8/14/2013,"Typical Applebee's fare, well-stocked bar... Generally speaking, Applebee's is not a bad place to go for a family meal.  Their lower calorie menu options are actually pretty tasty and don't make you regret having tried to eat a little more healthy.  They have good bar drinks, a variety of entrees including pasta, sandwiches, burgers, salads, ribs,... They have some pretty affordable lunch specials as well. However, recently I've noticed that this particular location has spotty service at best.  We have gotten horrible service the last few times we went, one time being squeezed into a booth made for 4 (even with 5 of us), without any real reason (it wasn't all that crowded), and then the staff forgot us there.  We left after ten minutes of not even an offer of water.  We came back about 5-10 minutes later to retrieve my husband's glasses he'd left at the table, and our menus were exactly as we'd left them... nobody even noticed that we'd left, much less that we'd been seated there to begin with. I like Applebee's over all, but honestly I'm not sure this is the best location to pick.  Kind of a shame, really, since my kids like the place, but I am not usually excited to test out the service when the idea comes up for a place to go to dinner, and the other Applebee's in town is completely on the other end of town. As an aside... Why are all these local Applebee's listed as ""Nightlife""?? Is the nightlife really that sad that the options are to go Applebee's??",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-davenport-6
AJ I.,"Aledo, IL",0,39,1,3.0,2/6/2015,"My first time at this Applebee's , lunch rush was over....Greeters and staff friendly. Seated immediately. Took my order for drinks served that quickly , took order. I was served my French Onion Soup but waited quite awhile for cheeseburger sliders appetizer.(45 minutes) Had to ask for coffee refill. Probably won't return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-davenport-6
Chels I.,"Lakeview, Chicago, IL",30,32,10,5.0,6/9/2014,"Not in love with Applebee's as a whole! But this particular place had great service.  I went in late for 1/2 off apps, got a booth in a section that was nearly closed (we requested to sit away from everyone else) and we expected to have slow service bc of our choice in section, but the service was great!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-davenport-6
