Gene B.,"East Bay, CA",251,648,993,3.0,10/18/2017,"Had dinner at Applebee's due to the fact we were lodging next door. We had a few rounds of Patron Perfect Margaritas, appetizers, and a hot skillet plate. I was quite impress how our bartender waited on us while she worked the bar. It's obvious they are understaffed, but it did not significantly impact the quality of our service. Not a spot to be picky, but definitely a place for drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-davis-2

Luke C.,"Davis, CA",288,229,1034,3.0,6/26/2017,"Applebee's can be a really mixed bag. I've been here and have had a very satisfactory meal that I enjoyed quite a bit, and at other times it has been a total failure. But overall my experience has been positive. When the meal isn't very good, it's because the food is too salty when done incorrectly.  If you're going to Applebee's, I'd recommend the two for $20 or two for $25 deal. It's a great deal! You get an appetizer and two entrees. The appetizer is full size and is a great way to start a meal. The selection that you can get is nice. I usually get either the boneless wings or spinach & artichoke dip and chips. (Hint: You can refill the chips, just ask!) As for the entrees, I really enjoy the ribs and mini ribs. They have a variety of flavors to choose from, and this is what they are known for. Some dishes, like the hamburger, come with way less food and will feel like a rip off. Don't go that route! One good thing just about every visit to Applebee's is the service. I don't think there was a time when the waitress wasn't very good. Tonight we had a server named Heaven. She was as good as her namesake. I think Applebee's is worth the visit if you order the right things. It's definitely not the best, but it can be a nice place to go every so often!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-davis-2

Blue B.,"Glenhaven, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/17/2017,"Walked into this Applebee's and it was fairly quiet, so we assumed the service would be good and fast. However our waitress (Jessica I believe but she had no name tag) was not the nicest, and we watched the other waitress working serve food to other people and get them out the door quicker than our waitress could even bring us our drinks. Our waitress was not the most hospitable person, and when asking for more chips replied with ""you can finish those before I bring you more"", after that comment our attitude changed to not being as bright. When we did receive the food it was all cold, all three steaks, the sides and the burger order. We sent our food back and the manager came back and took care of us. Our steaks were bigger but still the same temp. Everything else was good. Our waitress never came back to check on us, and she took so long so we paid over the automated pay system. Very happy to have the manager come and resolve the food issue with a better attitude however, still disappointed in the disrespectful waitress. Will not be coming back on my way through.

Aiyanajv ..,"Roosevelt, Fresno, CA",1,3,,1.0,5/15/2017,"Went in for my daughter's 7th birthday. It was eerily quiet and dead for a Saturday night...  Sat down anyway, the service was OK, wait time for drinks was slow considering there were very few people in there. Food came at a decent time though. We told the waitress it was my daughter's birthday and she said OK..  We were expecting a little song or some sort of happy birthday rendition. But instead, the waitress came and nonchalantly threw the ice cream in front of my daughter, and monotoneously said ""happy birthday,"" turned and left.  We were a little surprised, since every restaurant we've ever been to at least sang something, clapped something, or at least made the birthday person feel a little special. I highly recommend people visit the Fresno Applebees on Shaw near Clovis Ave on their birthday!  So enthusiastic, loud, and even made my little girl blush because it gets the whole restaurants attention.  Our whole section began to clap along with the singers. Even the manager was there clapping along with all the servers!

Hanne J.,"San Francisco, CA",1,10,,1.0,8/3/2015,"The restaurant spent a lot of money on their menu folders, with photos that make the meals look large and appetizing. This unfortunately does not translate to the meals themselves, which were unrecognizable. Philly steak with breaded vegetables, onion rings in a thick paste that left a bitter taste, limp Caesar salad from the bitter outer leaves of Romaine, covered in store bought croutons, and a special lunch meal sandwich on white bread that had been toasted long before the meal so it had gone mushy.

So far so good.  for appetizer, by chance, both parties ordered wings as appetizers.  So I got to taste two different wings: the regular with spicy buffalo sauce and blue cheese, and boneless wings mild.  If you like really spicy, then the spicy buffalo isn't spicy enough! the boneless wings were too spicy, and the ranch sauce that came with it didn't really help either.  we had two steaks: medium and medium well, and the quesadilla burger.  the medium steak was under seasoned, the fries were under seasoned, the  medium well was extra dead well-done, and even with a lot of A1 sauce, I still tasted the rubbery awful taste of overdone meat.  And the quesadilla burger... well to be honest, that one looked like it wasn't going to be my thing so I totally chickened out and didn't taste that one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-davis-2?start=60

SERVICE: I'm use to host/hostess @ Chili's opening the doors for guests as they enter & leave, but this location warmly greats its patrons by opening the doors also. Party of 3 (w/ elderly disabled pops included) seated immediately on a Sunday evening. Place wasn't jam packed, but definitely had patrons. Our Waitress Megan was excellent! Great personality & friendly enough to carry on a conversation w/ an old buzzard like my pops. Friendly & efficient service all around. Keep up the great work team! BITES: Pops had the House Salad while sis & I had their Caesar Salad. Decently sized plates; salads were just ok. $3.49 House Salad  $3.49 Caesar Salad  Between the 3 of us, we soooo burgered out with fries ^_^ Sis had the Southwest Burger that she said was quite spicy, but really good. Pops had the Bacon Cheddar Burger, that I wasn't sure he was gona be able to handle, but he sure did manage to put it away. We let him eat ""bad"" very minimally so he very much appreciated his meal & savored each delicious bite. Now me, my fav is their Quesadilla Burger *tee-hee*. I really should've just ate half & stopped, but it was so good & I'm not crazy about left over sandwiches...I put the WHOLE THING AWAY! Did I hurt afterwards...I can't lie, I did =( That's what happens when ur eyes are bigger than ur stomach. $8.99 Southwest Burger  $8.99 Bacon Cheddar Burger  $8.99 Quesadilla Burger  $3.99 Side of (overpriced) Fries  FINAL TAB: For party of 3, final bill came to $45.08. As we were getting ready to leave, they let us leave at a closer exit door by our table while my sis brough the car around for pops & I.

Jess s.,"San Francisco, CA",231,309,436,3.0,5/12/2011,"It was Sunday night and we were all too lazy to cook, so we decided to go out to Applebee's for some drinks and food- since the food shown on the tv commercials looks good.  Applebee's has this happy hour promo - from 9pm until closing their house margarita, house long island ice tea and whatever beer they have on tap is around $3 each( with the option to add in a flavor for an extra 50cents) and all appetizers are $5 with a purchase of a drink. Granted the happy hour menu wasn't that big (drink wise) but  I was there for margaritas anyways so it all worked out. I opted for a few margaritas. But my favorite combination is mango and strawberry blended margarita. Omfg. That shit was so good!! I had a couple.  We also ordered a mango ice tea that tasted like sewer water. It was super gross tasting and was not sweetened at all (worse $3 ever spent!). And took advantaged of their 2 for $20 deal and got ourselves the buffalo wings, Cajun shrimp pasta , and riblet.  The wings were perfect ! Not too spicy and not too greasy. The pasta was a little too spicy for my liking but the shrimp was done perfectly! As for the riblets, they were AMAZING!!!

Charlie P.,"Sacramento, CA",6,281,,2.0,2/18/2013,"Worst experience we have ever had at an Applebee's.   We waited over ten minutes for a server to come by and I eventually had to go to the front desk and request someone to help us with an order.  Another 5 mins passed before anybody showed up.  The restaurant was only half full so I can't blame it in being crowded.   The manager was more concerned with changing a sign in the bar than making sure customers were being attended to.  Once we finally got our order placed, the waitress went onto take the orders of three other tables before entering our order into the computer system.  Another 15 mins later, 2 of our drinks showed up and we had to wait another 5 mins to get the last one.   Other people who ordered after us received their food first and we were forced to watch them eating while we were growing older waiting for our food.  To add insult to injury, we witnessed the Manager check on a table right next to ours and walked right by us as if we were not even there.  What a lack of customer service!!! We go to the Gold River location every week, so we know what a good Applebee's is like.  We will not be returning to the Davis location as being treated as valuable customers is important to us.  Please beware of this location...they are blowing it and need help.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-davis-2?start=60

Review W.,"Seattle, WA",0,102,,3.0,3/18/2015,"First of all, I appreciated that a manager greeted us when we came in and came around to check on our table while we were eating. I don't think this has happened before at any other Applebee's so it was a nice touch.  We did have an issue, however, when it came to our check. One of us ordered a burger with a substitute of a salad instead of fries. When doing this in the past at other Applebee's, we've only been charged $1 for the substitution. When we got the bill, there was a $4+ charge for a salad. I believe this is the price of a separate side salad. I told the waitress this was incorrect, and she came back with a bill with a charge of $3.99, which I assume is the price of adding a salad to a meal, rather than substituting it for something else. I would not have minded this charge if I in fact ADDED the salad, and still got fries, but this was not the case. We unfortunately did not have time to sit there and hassle with the bill and teach the waitress how to do her job, so we paid the bill in full and instead took the amount we feel we were overcharged out of her tip.

The interior is clean, the bathrooms are well kept and although it's in an area that's not so populated, it gets pretty crowded on a weekend night. Overall, I enjoy Applebee's especially for their burgers and baby back riblets. I haven't found this type of appetizer anywhere else nor the taste at even the most awesome BBQ places I have been to. Not to say that it is better than those places but it's got something to offer that no one else has.

It has the same layout as any other and the customer service is decent. I came here twice for Finals week because I really needed an excuse to not study and well a person's gotta eat right?! The first round, I came for the happy  hour and got the buffalo wings for half off. I got the sweet and spicy flavored ones and they did get pretty spicy after a couple of pieces. I love that the portions are so big just for the appetizers. I couldn't even finish all my wings and had to ask my friend to help eat the rest. I would always recommend the buffalo wings because it comes in an abundant of supply and is delicious.  For my second return, I ordered the Lemon Shrimp Fettucine. It was pretty good itself but it came out with rice instead of pasta so I was really confused! However, I did not care much because I like rice anyway. The portion seemed smaller than the pasta dish that I got on one of my other visits. Or it could be that I was just starving that night.

I've had their 2 for $20 meals a few times with friends, but the food was just mediocre. I'd say if you come to applebees, just go for the appetizers and margaritas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-davis-2?start=80

Derald S.,"San Rafael, CA",7,17,,1.0,2/3/2014,"I was planning to drive through Davis at about dinner time on Super Bowl Sunday, so I called in the morning to ask about specials for the game and whatnot.  I was told on the phone that there would be quite a few specials including half priced appetizers, and that they would continue as long as the game was on.  We have kids, so I thought it would be fun to just order a bunch of appetizers, catch the end of the game, and go home. First, the waitress seemed irritated that we were even there from the beginning  Then, we were told that the appetizer specials ended at 6pm, we got there at 615, but the drink specials were still going.  So, we ordered some kids meals (On special for $199, yay!) for the kids, 2 for 20 for us and a margarita.   Once we received our food, we didn't see our waitress again until I had to follow her nearly into the kitchen to ask for our check.  We were overcharged for (literally) every thing on our menu except the 2 for 20.  Idk how much 12oz margaritas usually are, but $7 for a well margarita seems steep, even NOT during happy hour.   The whole experience nearly from the time we walked in, to the time we walked out was negative.  Save yourself the trouble, push on to Sac or Vacaville, or just go somewhere else.   Boo  :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-davis-2?start=80
Mary H.,"Alameda, CA",1,18,,1.0,4/26/2015,"OMG, where do I start?  We went for a Sunday lunch, the restaurant was slow.  Our greeter was very pleasant, showed us to our table and said our server would be with us shortly.  When the server didn't show for 15+minutes, the greeter came back and said that our server was busy, but he (the greeter) could get our beverage order.  He delivers our beverages in a few short minutes.  About 5 minutes later, our server arrives in a hurry and asks if he can get our beverage order, not realizing that it has already been taken care of.  We order.  When the food arrived, I discover that the medium well burger that I ordered was almost raw!  I knew it wasn't someone else's order because I had asked for my BBQ sauce on the side and no onions and this was done.  For the next 10+ minutes, I try to locate my server/any server to send back my burger for a little more cooking.  No one could be found and no one responded to the red light on their little table-side computer.  Finally, I see the greeter ushering in another party.  I ask him to come over--and he ignores me!  At this point, the two others in my party are nearly finished with their meals.  I pick up my plate and locate another server on the floor.  (Mine is nowhere to be found.)  This server apologizes profusely and says he'll replace my order.  About 10 minutes later (now my friends are finished with their meals), my order comes back with a complimentary second order of fries.  The burger, although now done the way I had requested, is dripping in grease.  The complimentary fries taste like stale fish.  I couldn't eat this meal!  So, we decide to check out--I couldn't see keeping my friends any longer and we needed to get on the road.  So I use the check-out table-side system only to find that they charged me twice for the icky burger.  I was almost tempted to pay for the extra burger just to get out of Dodge.  But, no that didn't seem right, either. I try the red light again and this time my server is there within a few minutes.  When I explained what happened he was very apologetic and admitted that the restaurant was having a ""really, really bad day"" (his words).  I actually felt terribly for the young guy.  I did tip him for his efforts, although he never came back to ask us if we need a beverage refresh. We won't go back.  My friends' food was not very tasty and expensive for the portions offered.  It just isn't worth going back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-davis-2?start=80

We came in and waited for 10 minutes with this ipad device on our table. The waitress finally came by and said ""did you guys already order?"" We were like....ummm no. She said ""ok, ill get your drinks and you can order on the app"" WTF? Is this a real restaurant or a food delivery service. We wait wait wait wait. A table of elderly couples left because no one was serving them. We should have followed their lead but unfortunately we stayed. My friends food came out without any of the specifications. He is allergic to tomato and there was a giant tomato slice, it seemed almost hostile. I ordered a pasta bowl without chicken and it was completely flavorless, microwaved pasta with no texture. We quickly asked for the check and she kept trying to convince us to pay with the app. We gave her our credit card and she was gone for another 8 minutes. The stupid ridiculous apps supposed big selling point is that you can play games while you wait for your food....exvept that the games cost money and are added to your bill! And why is there even a slot on the bill for a tip if they have computers at every table to do the job of the waitress. Will never be back! And the restaurant was completely empty so i take many other people refuse to come here to.

This place is like a BAD HABIT I can't break.  I give it 2 stars because I like the food but for a little while now, it's been not so bueno. SHORT VERSION: Slow service (will never use their to-go!), food is on the decline LONG VERSION: So, I called in a to-go order for an Oriental Chicken Salad ($9.99) and loaded mashed potatoes ($1.99), the guy on the phone said it would be around $12.  I drive there, park in the To-Go Parking...where they are supposed to spot your car and bring your food out.  Wellll, after 5 mins of waiting (in 97 degree weather mind you) I get out of the car and decide to walk in the restaurant to get the show on the road.  I walk through the patio and past 2 cashiers who don't bother asking me if I need help.  I tell them that I called in an order and one guy tells me to sit down then he disappears into the kitchen.  I see a to-go bag on the table across from me and wonder if it's mine.  Two minutes later, another guy walks to where I am, picks up the bag of food and proceeds to walk out the door.  He's going to my car and as he gives me the food, the bill is $2+ more than what they said on the phone (the potatoes are $3+).  I tell the waiter this and he goes back inside the restaurant to talk to the manager...I wait in the car with the AC on full blast.  He comes back out with my change...INCORRECT change might I add.  (I gave him $20.31 for a $14.31 bill and he comes back with $5 and change...DUH!)  By this point, I don't want to argue about the fact that they charged me more than what they said because frankly I am too freakin' hot and sweaty from waiting for them to give me my food.  And to top it off, my salad didn't come with enough dressing!  Usually when I eat it in the restaurant I have too much and now too little!! My go-to dish here were the RIBLETS; but they must have changed the way they cook it because it started tasting REALLY lousy...too CHEWY.  I usually order the oriental chicken salad and I really like the loaded mashed potatoes.  Their MANGO LEMONADE is also pretty good.   The service is so-so...depends on who you get.  The guy that looks like Horatio from SNL was pretty rude when I went with a party of 10.  He looked like he hated his job.

Cynthia W.,"Davis, CA",0,6,,3.0,1/15/2014,"Overall rating: 3 stars Service: 2 stars Food: 3 stars Value: 3 stars I was very happy when this Applebee's opened in Davis, as it's one of the only places in Davis where you can get general American cuisine, and still is. I use to be a regular here and ended up knowing most of the staff and management at one time. Yes, you read that right, past tense. Over the years the service has gone from great to just fair, and I've seen this place lose a lot of repeat business because of it, which is quite depressing because I'd like the place to stick around. When you do get service, in my experience, it's usually friendly, but more often than not you're going to have longer than average wait times. You definitely don't want to come here if you are on any kind of time schedule! If you're here just to chill and relax and have nowhere to go, it can be ok. The staff do seem to be more interested in talking with each other and doing small tasks like rolling up silverware than really paying attention to their customers, and this hurts business. While I understand certain tasks need to be done, customers should really come first, and it's irritating when, as a customer, you suddenly need something like a drink refill, extra napkins, etc and you can't get the attention of your waiter/waitress who is over in the corner rolling up silverware and chatting with their coworkers - no matter how slow business might be. Sitting at the bar helps eliminate some of these problems, but you shouldn't have to sit at the bar to have a decent meal with service. I've also had a few (though rare) experiences where they've been completely out of something basic - for example, tonight they had no ice cream. So much for ordering any dessert :( This place does have some good things going for it though. For starters, they are open late - usually until at least midnight. They also have free WiFi, clean restrooms, and when I've come in the place is always kept pretty clean in general. They have some decent happy hour specials, including late night happy hour (after 9PM Mon-Thur) where a number of appetizers are half price (but full size) - my favorites for this are the boneless honey BBQ wings (nearly a meal in itself), and the fried mozzarella sticks. There's the 2-for-$20 deal which is worthwhile if you like the offerings there (my husband and I usually choose this) - you get 2 entrees and a free appetizer. You save a couple of bucks off the normal price of each entree and get a free (full size) appetizer to boot. I've sometimes even ordered the 2-for-$20 for myself and just have the second entree and half the appetizer boxed up to take home for lunch/dinner the next day. Rare is the time I've had a bad meal (food-wise) here, but the food is also typical Applebee's, so it's not going to wow you in any way. Tip: Order to go, or don't be under any time schedule when you come here. Also, take advantage of their specials.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-davis-2?start=80

I feel like I come here just to get a change of scenery whenever I hang out with friends and we just want something to eat or drink.  I shared an entree with my friend last night and it was seriously the saddest looking plate I've ever seen! I think the reason why it was so upsetting was because it was $10 and if I had known it was going to look so sad I would've just stuck to a burger or something.  I usually share a 2 for $20 which usually never fails me because you can't go wrong with the spinach dip or mozzarella sticks and the chick penne pasta, but those are no brainers that any restaurant could make if they really wanted to. They have happy hour specials depending on which day you go to so it's cool if you want to get a cheap drink.  I like their personal paying machine that they have at each table because it makes paying for groups less complicated. I will say service is a little lack luster and it varies on each visit. I guess I'm rating it 2 stars because even though this is a chain restaurant there should at least be more effort from their staff and food.

We sat there for 10 to 15 minutes and NOONE had come up to us, they weren't that busy. A couple who was seated in the booth behind us were already being served. I was pretty pissed at this point so I went ahead and ordered our drinks, appetizer and entrees on the monitor hoping that would alert someone's attention about 5 to 10 minutes later ""our server"" came over and asked if she could get us drinks and I told her I already ordered everything on the monitor. It took the bartender 15 mins to make my drink from the time I put it into the monitor. I looked over to see why she was taking so long. She was measuring all of the contents out for each drink she was making, do they not train bartenders to do counts here??? So our appetizer comes to our table, we got salsa Verde beef nachos with no jalapeños and it comes out with just cheese and meat so I had to send it back. 10 mins after we finish our nachos ""our server"" comes over and ask if we wanted anything else and we both were like we put in entrees and she says ""oh I didn't see that on the monitor"" leaves to go to the kitchen and comes out a few mins later with our food and it taste like it's been sitting under the heat lamps, my sister asked for no jalapeños on her burger and it had them on there, she mumbled under her breath about it and she heard her and asked if everything was okay, so my sister said well I asked for no jalapeños and the server argues with her saying the pico comes with jalapeño and asked if she wanted it taken back but we were already frustrated so she said no. Our server never came to check to see if our food was good, I was suprised to get a water refill after it had been sitting there. We ordered dessert from the MONITOR because our server was nowhere to be found and that suprisingly came out at a descent time. At the end she gives us our spit bill but I didn't bother to wait for her to come by and pick up our bill, so we payed on the monitor. I have never received service this bad.

Two months ago the company promoted the all you can eat cross cut ribs deal. It was good and filling that I stopped after 2 servings.  Today I had the classic American burger with bottomless fries for $9.99. It was fine if you didn't mind NOT having lettuce, tomatoes, or red onions with your burger. The beef patty was well done and it was drenched with a worsheshire type sauce. It was not messy but like a tasty basic burger off the grill. In the three times I've eaten at this Applebees within 2 months it seems like most of the servers working the same shift will help one another by bringinng out food to tables.

The last time I came here was for dinner with a fairly large group.  The servers here are champs, considering our group has 60 people and we came all at once.  They were very patient and brought our food out in a very timely manner.

Richard P.,"San Jose, CA",3,250,,3.0,10/7/2011,"Richard Pro here with another review. I'm not the hugest fan of American restaurants, so let's get down to it. I've been to Applebee's twice, both times late at night when I was extremely hungry. Very memorable experiences both times because I was absolutely starving and had a very long day. I've discovered pasta is a safety at American restaurants--it's very hard to screw up. I enjoy the three cheese chicken penne here. Is it amazing? No. Portions are too small for me, and for $14 it's rather disappointing. The garlic bread is a disgrace--feels like it's slathered with a type of cantonese sauce called sa cha jiang. What other options are there besides pasta? Oh, the usual burgers, steak, fries, artichoke dip, etc. Appetizers are a rip off, but they're a rip off everywhere. How are your fries and steak and whatever? Typical. Very, very typical. Go for the pasta. However boring it is, it's decent pasta and I enjoy it more than I would a burger.  At American restaurants, service seems to be the priority over taste, so that's what I usually enjoy for the price I pay. By no means is this great food; however, the interior is nice, service is nice, lighting is nice, so it's okay. One of the better American restaurants of the thousands out there. I would never come here by choice or willingly though...the food just doesn't have that appeal. When I'm hungry, I want to eat. 3 stars, and I'm being nice here. If I were to be mean I'd give this place 1 star because it's not worth it and it doesnt give me a happy food feeling. When you want to eat something that makes you relax and makes your tiring day go away, you want to go to your special 5 star restaurant, and Applebee's isn't it for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-davis-2?start=100

Tiffany R.,"San Francisco, CA",1,8,49,1.0,4/25/2014,"Horrible experience here and I now hate Applebee's. My cousins and I were looking forward for a late night meal since we didn't have time to eat dinner since we had to go see a show.  We show up and half out party is already there. They were there for 30 minutes and were stilling waiting on their drinks. We had to wait 15 minutes until we were even brought menus.  The waitress/bar tender was extremely rude. When we told her that were were ready to order she snapped at us with, ""yea I know, everyone is ready to order."" Rude much. So after, we asked a different waiter if he could take our order and he was friendly and very helpful.  We finally ordered. I just got an Oreo milkshake because I wanted something sweet and fast. I was expecting it to come right away. But no. I waited 45 minutes for a milkshake. By the time I got it I wasn't even hungry. I just wanted to go to bed by then because it was around 11:30 at night.  I don't recommend coming here. You would probably have better service at carls jr which is right next door.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-davis-2?start=40

Demis C.,"Davis, CA",212,3,,1.0,9/9/2015,"I used to work at Applebee's before so my expectations for this restaurant would be the same any previous employee would have (I am also servsafe certified). I will start with the good which is the host who greeted in a professional manner and open the door for us. That was the only good part of this experience. The bad, which is the following: 1. Server putting on uniform in plain sight of the guests and using the tables where people eat at to place her clothes and using the chairs guests sit on to tie her shoes (which were not the required non slip shoes and clothes that are not appropriate for the work place in a restaurant) 2. Counted 4 servers who would get drinks from the back place them on a table that is designated for guests and would constantly go to the table to get sips from their drinks and to use their phones while they were on their shift and their sections (section of the restaurant designated to that specific server) would be waiting on their server to pass by and you can see this because everyone was looking around or right at them as they took their ""mini-breaks"" 3. Servers would leave their phones and other personal belonging at tables that are meant for guests and keep going back to these tables constantly (servers always had their nametags on even when taking 5-25min constant breaks in front of their customers)  4. Server empty out trash can at their station and came back to the table where her phone was in less than a minute which is not enough time to wash her hands, worst thing she came back with food to deliver to another table 5. Server took about 15 minutes to get our table water from the time we sat down (Restaurant was not on peak hours and had about a quarter of their tables filled) 6. The food was just ""OK"" and they didn't seem to hide the fact some of their food is refrigerated/frozen (cold in center) 7. Server never came with our check, 20 mins passed since we finished eating and decided to use the convenient and most friendly staff the restaurant had, the tablet gadget to pay our check I felt very disappointed with this visit, it is not the first time I noticed odd things at this specific restaurant and I keep giving them chances to redeem because I have a special connection since my first job was at an Applebee's but I think this is the last time I will go back to this location. 2 for 20 is just not worth it when you have a terrible experience",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-davis-2?start=40

Don't remember the name exactly. And for appetizer, we chose the artichoke and spinach dip. It comes with chips and salsa. It was pretty filling!

This would've been fine had there not been a party using the outdoor patio that decided to keep the door open over 50% of the time we were there. The waitress we had was also taking care of that big party and ringing up each person with their credit card, so it took forever for management to catch on that they should take care of her other tables as well. 15-20 minutes after seating we finally got our order in. The food itself was fine - that's not where it was lacking. The service was what absolutely killed me, and the sad thing is it wasn't even our waitress' fault.  To me, it was the management who failed to see that she needed help.  We spoke to the manager after who pretty much brushed off our complaints with ""as long as the food was fine"". He tried to offer us free dessert which we turned down - who wanted to sit there in the cold and eat dessert??? And just in case you were curious, we were both wearing jackets and we were still super cold.  I mentioned that there were other tables open when we came in and the manager said ""had there been we would've seated you elsewhere"". I guess I must've been imagining things when I saw the empty tables... Honestly, Applebee's never failed me before when were looking for a place that had a good selection of appetizers and decent food.  This time, the response from the management was the last straw.  I hardly ever will go and complain to management because that's just not my thing - that's just how horrible it was.  The place is probably still fine to go to during their slower times, like some other reviewers have suggested.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-davis-2?start=140
