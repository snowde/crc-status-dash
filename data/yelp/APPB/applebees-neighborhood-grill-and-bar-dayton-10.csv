Rick A.,"Kettering, OH",12,191,125,4.0,12/22/2012,Ordered the lunch combo with the sliders. Just about the right size portion and served within their 14 minute deadline. It has been a while since we have been at Applebee's but the new menu means we will be returning more often.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dayton-10
Dale R.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,3,1,1.0,12/27/2017,"Use to be a big fan of Applebee's but in the last few years their prices went up and the service and food went down.  My wife and I received 2 gift cards and thought we would try another location other than the one close to our house. Disappointed the mac and cheese was like eating rubber, my wife's steak in her salad was like chewing on a tire. We came in at 2:57 and the guy took our drink order and appetizer and my wife realized that at 3:00 it would be 1/2 price apps and I went and ask the guy to hold in entering the order and it literally threw him in a tailspin and he had to go ask his manager. Done, last time, never eating at this or any Applebee's",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dayton-10
Jessica W.,"Dayton, OH",46,3,1,1.0,10/13/2017,Don't come while it's dollar margaritas I've been here for 45 mins only had one drink and still no food. I ordered an appetizer. The worst costumer service ever!!!  And the food was cold when I got it talk about upset!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dayton-10
Jennifer C.,"Brunswick, OH",0,6,,1.0,7/27/2017,They are horrible can't order 15wings have to do orders of 10 never been this way used to be able to get queso cheese on the side can no longer do that!! Save your money!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dayton-10
Milo O.,"Dayton, OH",18,25,21,4.0,9/29/2015,"Burger and fries were delicious! The new Cedar Grilled Lemon Chicken dish was very good! Our burger was not well done like we asked, but the manager made it more than right! Burger recooked and on the house! Oh and a free dessert ""Churro S'mores"" (delicious) and a sincere apology from Michael the manager has turned this experience into a pleasant one! Thanks to everyone who made it right! Oh and this Tuesday evening hosted live music. Nice:)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dayton-10
Ran G.,"Dayton, OH",0,30,,3.0,5/17/2017,Came in for a beer and appetizers at lunchtime. Appetizers were good spinach dip and chips and steak quesadillas. Music that they play sucks brings the place down .Mia the bartender friendly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dayton-10
Mg G.,"Dayton, OH",0,14,,1.0,11/27/2016,"Hands down the worst excuse for ribs I've ever had.  On top of that, the husband was made to wait for 30 minutes after the suggested time for pickup.  And get this...everything was cold.  So apparently our food was just sitting on the bar while the hubby was waiting.  Yes, he did call while he was out there.  Seems to have no pride in quality or service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dayton-10
Clark T.,"Dayton, OH",7,12,8,4.0,10/14/2015,Good price and food. Service friendly but slow. Atmosphere pleasant and comfortable. Come here often.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dayton-10
Emily S.,"Clayton, OH",22,14,1,1.0,7/7/2016,"Visited with another couple and their infant baby who is 5 months old. We were asked if we needed a kid's menu. Really? It was 8 pm on a Sunday night when we arrived. Our server was prompt at first then we rarely saw her tending ANY tables in her section. All of us were looking around, holding empty glasses the entire night. I ordered a long island ice tea and received a ""bahama mama"" at first, and sent it back. Our food came and our friend's steak came out Medium when asked for Medium-rare. After 15 minutes of looking around blankly, we snagged what seemed to be the only other waitress working and told her the steak was wrong and instead of Medium-rare she will take it Rare. After 25 minutes of waiting our original waitress comes out with her steak and says ""Here is your steak, Medium"". We shook our heads and said just take it off. She replied ""Gotchu"" and walked away. Needless to say we stiffed her, which is highly against my moral code. Lose the attitude lady, we were absolutely not rude in any way. We were apologizing to YOU. Absolutely will NEVER return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dayton-10
Phil T.,"Dayton, OH",0,1,1,2.0,5/7/2014,"Every time we come it seems like our once favorite Applebee's has slipped another notch.  Happy hour appetizers now don't include half of the items on the appetizer menu. All that aside it took 45 min. to get our food. Seriously - boneless wings, quesadillas and Won Ton tacos! We asked to see the manager and she didn't come until we had paid and were getting ready to leave.   She offered us a coupon but never came back or told anyone up front.  It'll be a long time before I want to give this another shot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dayton-10
Bob H.,"Dayton, OH",2,61,4,5.0,6/6/2015,A great experience once again ! My go to is isually the the Bourbon Street steak but lately the Green Goddess has become my new fav. The staff here is what really sets this place apart. Eatin good in the neighborhood !!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dayton-10
Robert C.,"Dayton, OH",1,34,,5.0,1/24/2015,Nice size portion good hamburgers the waitresses are friendly wife and I have been here 3or4 times now and always have had good service and good food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dayton-10
Lisa L.,"Loveland, OH",121,246,196,1.0,5/3/2015,"Even worse than before, Cori at the bar is exceptional but the new food rations are crazy small,not even enough for a child to eat. I can't stand the NEW applebees. So sad. Our bill with drinks were way over 50.00 and my burger was about as big as a whopper jr. and my friends pasta was so small the prices are ridiculous!  Very very unhappy customer with the food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dayton-10
Megan P.,"Tiffin, OH",43,3,,2.0,1/14/2016,"Service was not good today. Our drinks ran out, our server didn't know the menu, and we were ignored. The steaks were terrible and chewy and cooked incorrectly. Would not come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dayton-10
Francis O.,"Fairborn, OH",201,28,9,5.0,5/8/2014,What can I say.  Finally a great experience! The last 4 times where hard but tonight a grand slam was hit. Everything was perfect. The food was smoking hot and the service was great. Most impotently the girl was happy. Will be back soon.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dayton-10
Josh S.,"Waynesville, OH",0,7,1,2.0,8/3/2014,Incredibly slow service and when our meals finally arrived they were wrong. The tables and boothes were not clean either. On the bright side our glasses were never empty and the server we had was very polite. I would recommend other apple bees just not this one.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dayton-10
Vanessa P.,"Bellbrook, OH",61,71,29,3.0,7/12/2013,"Have to admit, I'm usually not a fan of Applebee's but I went with a friend and tried the Napa Valley Chicken and it was wonderful.  Grilled chicken with caramelized onions and mushrooms, served with zucchini, onions and peppers.  Also came with a side of roasted potatoes but I substituted with a side salad.  Would go back and order it again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dayton-10
