Melanie S.,"Westminster, CO",0,2,,1.0,2/14/2016,"I get the feeling that most Applebee's customers are not exactly perusing Yelp before making the trip but I feel a review is necessary regardless.  We made the choice to eat here on Valentine's day because it was close to the highway and I had to go to work that night. This is our second visit and probably our last.  The server was very friendly.  The food was very bad.  Period.  The beer took 10 minutes to get to our table.  The soup had some sort of chewy non edible piece of meat.  My salad was dressed incorrectly and the manager actually argued with me about it being correct.  In addition, the salad looked more like a side portion than a 9.99 full salad.  The burger was reasonable but very, very greasy.  Kids meal was ok I suppose but the yogurt looked a little curdled.  I was so dissapointed in the food I spoke to the manager again and he did comp our meal.  That was the right thing to do, but I still feel like I won't be coming back.  I left hungry and upset about the experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-denver-10?start=20
Paul B.,"Denver, CO",1,5,1,2.0,4/3/2015,"I don't expect too much from Applebee 's but this store seems to have a ""don't give a damn"" attitude from the service to the food to the management. The server was polite but only marginally attentive and when it became clear that we weren't going to be a big ticket, her interest faltered. The pretzel rods and cheese was the highlight. The meatballs were mealy and cold.  The other items were bland. Sent them back and when the manager brought them back he had no idea what was going on.  A general lack of effort, and not worth my time or money when there are other places within walking distance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-denver-10?start=20
Sarah V.,"Denver, CO",234,299,57,2.0,7/22/2013,"I haven't been to an Applebee's in a few years, but I got a couple of gift cards and decided to stop in for a family dinner. We ordered 2 kids meals and 3 adult meals with 2 appetizers.  For dinner I got the grilled cheese (it has a fancier name), and it was very good for a grilled cheese. My daughter got the three cheese chicken penne and it was decent, a bit lacking in flavor but edible. The appetizers were probably the best part, we got a cheese dip and also fried cheese sticks, they were both exactly what you would expect.  The total for the food that we got was almost $75!!! Like I've told you before, I am not a cheap skate or anything but wowza, 75 bucks for some less than great food? That's a lot. We could have gone to another place where the food is amazing and eaten for $10-$15 per plate and enjoyed it a heck of a lot more! I'd say that for these prices, you may as well hit up some place better, it's my pet-peeve that people choose these ""cheaper"" restaurants when really they end up costing almost the same.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-denver-10?start=20
Shari G.,"Tempe, AZ",187,74,6,5.0,6/27/2015,"Started with the pretzel rods with beer cheese, tried the pot stickers, had the spinach salad with shrimp.....

Beau S.,"Westminster, CO",106,3,,1.0,11/24/2015,First I would like to say the staff was amazing. We ordered food to go and did the 2 for $20 deal with a dessert. When I went to pick it up I had to wait an extra 10 minutes because they didn't have it ready. I understand there was a game on and a few people dining however I showed up after the time suggested for me to be there. When I got my food and took it home I found out that I was missing 3 out of the four sides and the appetizer we started with (chips and salsa) tasted very stale. So when I called to ask about getting our sides they apologized and offered to make them fresh. Deal they made the error correct and I was semi happy. So after we ate our meal we decided to enjoy dessert (the 2 chocolate cake thing with ice cream) however we were very unsatisfied with the flavor. I don't even know how to describe the taste it was just terrible. Needless to say I won't be going back to this Applebee's not because of poor service just the poor quality of food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-denver-10?start=20
Christy J.,"Denver, CO",8,61,62,4.0,5/30/2014,"Rebel IPA, need I say more. Ok, so I do. The appetizers are good. My favorite is the Pretzel Rods with dip and Wanton Tacos.  I tried the Bourbon Black & Bleu burger. YUM!!!!! For Applebee's it's really good. The staff friendly and understood my problems with being in public with my Autistic boy and accommodated us. I've seen the reviews and usually I agree with them, but this time I don't.  The food really has improved through the years and the staff really like what they are doing.

El Lisha M.,"Thornton, CO",10,12,14,2.0,6/26/2015,Applebee's isn't like it use to be.  First of when I got there I say in the bar at a round table and no one came to greet me for 7 minutes.  Then my friend showed up and no one came to greet her let alone bring her a water.  We had to move to the bar to get service.  It's almost as if we didn't exist when we were sitting a the cocktail table but when we sat at the bar our service we received was good the food was good it was just the first impression was not very impressionable.  I remember when I use to come to this Applebee's and not even have time to think about what I want to drink because the greeting was so quick and friendly.  Not this time I don't if it's because we came during shift change or what but I think customers should always come first.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-denver-10?start=20
Ladie G.,"Westminster, CO",0,5,,1.0,12/13/2015,"So we went to Applebee's again. This time I was not at all impressed. Seemed like the management had their panties in a bunch, threatening the servers and cooks. My server was great and food came out hot and In a timely manner so I don't know what the problem was. This is the 3rd time I've been to this particular location and every time it seems like the management is on the warpath about something there, just real negative all the time really kills a positive vibe. makes me not wanna go there ever again.  to be witness to the servers getting treated like crap really kind of upsets me because the servers don't get paid anything but tips ,  it makes no sense for them to have to put up with poor management. I don't know Applebees you better get your priorities straight and look into the way your management treats your employees. and of all the Applebees that I've gone to this one has to be one of the worst when it comes to management",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-denver-10?start=20

Peter B.,"Denver, CO",253,47,54,1.0,1/14/2010,"All I wanted for Christmas was a John Lennon poster but instead I got a $25 gift card to Applebee's.   Unfortunately I couldn't trade it in for cash.   So I ventured in, ordered some bland microwaved foods and used the rest of the card on beer.  And by beer I mean yellowish water with a slight beery taste.  Maybe it was Miller Lite. As I noshed I looked around at the people who had come for dinner after an evening of shopping at Wal-Mart.  I could see the dead souls in their eyes.  The wait staff just barely more alive.

J H.,"Denver, CO",5,6,,1.0,2/19/2014,We have been here a few times and for the most part enjoyed the food and this last time was no exception. So the reason I'm only giving this place a one star is because we were celebrating my husbands birthday there and he had received a birthday card from his parents. He didn't get a chance to open his card during dinner and as soon as we were out the door he remembered that he left it in the table. He went right back in and found that it was already gone along with our plates that had been cleared. We asked our waitress if she had picked it up and had also ask the other staff if they had picked it up of corse no one admitted to it. We also asked if perhaps it had been picked up on accident and thrown in the trash and they said they looked and didn't see it. We also asked the one table that had anyone near us while we were dining and they said they didn't see it. It's not very likely that any other diners took it. We found out that the gift in the card was a pretty awesome gift.  We are really disappointed in this restaurant.  And will not be back. My advice is don't leave anything there and expect to ever see it again. :(,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-denver-10?start=20
Brian J.,"Commerce City, CO",61,125,140,3.0,7/21/2017,"I always expect the food to be at any Applebee's, yet I always seem to not disagree when someone suggests eating there.  One thing I am reluctant to ordering are main courses, which never turns out well for me.  What's funny is that I always find myself perusing thru the whole menu like I am going to find something to change my mind.   This time I just went with the 3 appetizers for 12.59 deal: Chicken Wonton Tacos, Steak quesadillas, and French onion soup.  The tacos and quesadillas weren't bad, but the French Onion Soup was better than the 2.  If I do come back here again, I would probably order the soup and forget about the other 2.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-denver-10

Hubby needs water and he had to ask for refills or just drank mine since his sat empty for too long. I had the Southwest Steak salad and it was good. However, they don't give you as much steak as what the menu pictures and a few pieces were fatty and tough. And, there was no chimichurri sauce, which I didn't notice until I started this review. The menu describes it and pictures it. Look at my picture. No sauce on the steak. Hubby had the Thai shrimp salad which he liked. 3 stars for consistency, however if they have pictures in the menu, your food you actually get should look the same.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-denver-10
Marlene W.,"Denver, CO",0,16,,1.0,5/21/2017,"By far the worst service experience I've had at any Applebee's. It was much like watching a train wreck can't remember the waitress name. It she was a blonde with a huge forehead and nasty attitude she seemed to have absolutely no idea what she was doing when she asked for our drink order she barely let me speak as soon as i said strawberry lemonade she said ""ok"" and walked away then of course no surprise I got regular lemonade probably because she forgot and wrote nothing down. We waited for 40 minutes then we asked our waitress and she was very rude when Our food finally arrived it was cold and my husbands ""BBQ"" ribs were not barbecued and where super dry.

Mark O.,"Coralville, IA",74,339,357,3.0,6/25/2015,"Bartender was friendly, but seemed very interested in two of her (loud) friends that came in shortly after I did.  I got charged 50¢ extra for sour cream, as that's my preferred dip for boneless wings, despite the fact I didn't use any ranch or blue cheese.  I've always found it a tad bit annoying when places determine what should be served with food and then charge extra when you choose something else, even if the cost is negligible.  The wings were oversauced and seemed like the cook threw them together without much care.   I also tried their new ""house chips"" which are fairly thick cut (compare them to Wavy Lays).  They had a smattering of black pepper on them.  The previous ""potato teasers"" were much better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-denver-10

I told her go ahead and refund my whole check then if it's too hard to just make a steak and be polite to customers. She she kissed my ass and said she'd fix it. So I Google a medium steak to make sure I'm not being stupid. I show it to her. SHE BRINGS ME BACK A STEAK THAT HAS BEEN BARELY BROWNED AND IS LITERALLY BLUE IN THE MIDDLE.

Kayla R.,"Thornton, CO",65,43,165,4.0,2/22/2016,"The atmosphere of this particular Applebees is chill. I walked in to no host and after about 5 minutes of looking around I just ended up sitting at the bar. I got a glass of their house Pinot Grigio (which was Barefoot) and started of with a bowl of their Tomato and Basil soup. It came out hot and nicely garnished. I didn't mind the texture, however,  it seemed thicker than other tomato soups I've tried. I barely taste the basil. The soup itself was pretty decent, although reminds me of pasta sauce.  For dinner I ordered the new cheeseburger rolls and wonton tacos. My husband got the beer cheese burger and fries.  The cheese burger bites were very crispy and cheesy, I expected more meat, however am over all satisfied. The dipping sauce is great adding a nice hotness to the dish.  The wanton tacos were nice and crispy, however a lot spicier than I remember. The parsley on top was kinda sloppily cut but didn't take away from the flavor.  My husband loved his burger, it was cooked perfectly and looked beautiful. The fries were super crispy and seasoned. He was very satisfied.  Finally I got the most genius dessert, the brownie bite. It was the perfect size and the brownie was warm and was complimented by the Icecream!

Martin L.,"Denver, CO",0,75,11,1.0,3/30/2017,"Absolutely horrible food. Had the Thai shrimp salad which was previously frozen shrimp defrosted, (not even heated up or even seasoned unlike the photos depicted on the menu and on Lori H.'s photo) and added to a small amount of lettuce with Japanese edameme soy beans. Not worth $6.00 never mind $12.00 for what could have passed for a side salad. The wife had the pepper crusted sirloin over natural grains. I honestly can't tell you which was worse. They both were extremely bad. Her dish was like beef barley soup that had larger pieces of tough beef but tasted moldy. The cooks here should go back to Mc D's or Taco Smell.  On top of the terrible food we were charged $2.00 for an electronic box that we had no idea there was a charge for. No sign on the table, no sign on the menu we saw and certainly the waitress never said anything-RIP OFF!!!  Waitress was pleasant but not that attentive. We will never go back.
