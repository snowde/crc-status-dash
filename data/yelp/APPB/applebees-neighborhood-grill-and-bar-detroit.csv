Erik M.,"Hamtramck, MI",76,143,78,3.0,12/12/2017,"The interchangeable nature of Applebee's restaurants is something they heavily bank on. To pull into a restaurant, know exactly what you can order and what it will look like,  no matter where you are in the country, is a convenience and a resource for many, especially those with specific tastebuds or finicky children. Some may see it as a beacon of light amongst shady looking local diners. and the bottom line, really, is that a lot of people really enjoy it. Who are we to say that's wrong? Our server, Lakieshia, was very nice, although she was maybe a little bored with working at Applebee's, and did a great job. Though the service seemed a bit slow, due to the lack of waitresses, she brought us extra stuff (cups of condiments, mostly) on more than one occasion, and fixed the mistakes that occurred. Their menu includes a number of dinner value meals, which include appetizer, two entrees (from a small list) and dessert. For $25, this is not a bad deal at all, and a couple can go all out and leave the restaurant for under forty or fifty dollars. Appetizers seem to flow freely, and three of us got free appetizers for checking in with the yelp app- coupons and specials are common in newspapers as well. Their rareness system for burgers consists of two meager and meaningless choices: pink or no pink. I understand this is a dumbed down system and it is meant to make ordering easier for folks that don't care. However, in practice it is useless - 'pink' vs. 'no pink' seemed to have no difference for anyone in the group.

John X.,"Ferndale, MI",4,26,,1.0,1/7/2018,"Horrible service.  I sat at the bar and waited 10 minutes before the bartender even acknowledged me.  When she did, I ordered a glass of water and a dinner entre.  10 minutes later, I still did not have my water.  When I got up to put my coat on, the bartender ran over and said my dinner ""would be right out.""  I told her I still did not even have my water, and then I left.  Really bad service, poor training and/or a complete lackadaisical attitude towards patrons.  Read the other Yelp reviews about this particular Applebee's and you will see a common theme here - apparently their horrible service at this particular location is legendary.  Not sure why Applebee's Corporate hasn't come down hard on this location to get its act together because it's got to be affecting their bottom line.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-detroit
Chandice W.,"Hazel Park, MI",6,17,26,1.0,12/17/2017,"My experience here was AWFUL! Customer service is HORRIBLE. I dined in with another adult and a child.I had to go back to the hostess stand and ask for our server!!(strike 1) Next, he shows up, take our drink orders and don't return for another 12-15 minutes.(strike 2)The last straw for me was the food. I received a free appetizer for checking in on Yelp. Nice perk but the boneless wings were so COLD. I sent them back so here's even more waiting. So the entrees arrive. Kid chicken tenders and fries were ""chicken tenders and fries."" All frozen I'm sure. The other adult had the burger with the egg. It was completely FLAVORLESS! Nothing special at all. And last but not least, my food. Applebee's menu is mostly frozen, low quality food, so I figured the pasta should be ok at best. Well, I was absolutely wrong! I actually NEVER ATE ONE BITE BECAUSE I WAS DISSATISFIED WITH THE FOOD. It looked like someone ate half of the chicken breast then put the other half on the plate. I called the manager on duty to address this issue.  He told me that the dish only gets half of a seven oz. chicken breast!! I couldn't believe it. Long story short. Applebee's is for senior citizens or families on a strict budget. It's cool Detroit is coming up, and trying to compete with smaller cities, but the business is ran A-- BACKWARDS! Look at my pasta.........",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-detroit
Lolita A.,"Fairburn, GA",0,14,11,2.0,10/7/2017,"Call ahead to be sure ""Champagne"" isn't working. Everyone seated near me complained about cocktails she poured. I want to be sure not to refer to her aa a bartender. She's down right rude.  I Can't understand why she's allowed to work in a restaurant. Additionally, what's the dress code for the food industry? If she would sling the drinks as hard as she slings those braids, maybe there would be less complaints.  She has bad service skills & a bad attitude.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-detroit
Ben O.,"Ferndale, MI",4,67,4,1.0,11/8/2016,"Will never ever be coming back. Terrible from start to finish. Tool forever to be seated, salad came out with no dressing...go figure, with big hard chunks of cabbage (see picture.) Medium rare steak was cooked to hell. Took 15 minutes to track down a waitress. Finally came back and it was so tough I had a hard time cutting it. 6oz and 2oz were all fat. At the end they comped some of our meal...thata great. But you ruined mine and my kids night.  This applebees needs to be shut down. It a terrible representation of the brand and is making no customers happy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-detroit

Juston M.,"Ferndale, MI",153,408,7,2.0,3/7/2017,"a couple gift cards brought me back to the crapplebees after years of hiding. it hasn't improved. the angus beef nachos, were hamburger covered in squeeze cheese. the boneless wings, just batter covering a cold chunk of chicken? all the food made us queasy later in the night. but, the bar, the bar is worth returning. if was off the hook the night we went. or at least, off the hook for an applebees. and the bartender was super nice. she should really work somewhere nicer.  love, juston",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-detroit
Liz P.,"Clawson, MI",618,1174,2395,5.0,11/2/2015,"Disclosure: I came here for the soft opening a few weeks ago, I was invited as a blogger.  I was excited to check this location out, it's pretty close to me and is in Detroit proper, at 8 Mile and Woodward. The decor is very nice, and Detroit-oriented, which was fun.  We were allowed to get 1 app or dessert and an entree each. My boyfriend was my dinner date, and his entree card said he could get any seafood dish, so he tried the grilled salmon, which he said was good. My card gave me a choice of five entrees, and I chose the sirloin with onions and roasted tomato - also delicious, and less than 600 calories too.  We got the double crunch (bone-in) wings for our app, and we also got a chocolate lava cake for dessert. I usually dislike non-boneless wings but these were very good, with a honey BBQ sauce.  Service was great too, especially since it was a ""mock dinner service"" event.  They do a regular happy hour plus a late night one so I'll be back at some point for that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-detroit
Mirriah J.,"Berkley, MI",0,11,2,2.0,4/24/2017,Damn I wish I would've looked at reviews first. Didn't have a server to the table for 20 minutes after we were sat. My kid is going crazy. Haven't even had the food yet.  Ugh.  Update. Been here 40 minutes no food. It's Monday. The place is half empty.  2nd update. Food is good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-detroit
RE A.,"Detroit, MI",177,405,658,2.0,6/3/2016,This is a brand new location on 8th Mile Road at the corner of Woodward. It's busy a lot but it also needs better training for the service staff. Sometimes the wait just to be taken to your table and seated or to place your food order is really too long.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-detroit
Julie A.,"Frederick, MD",10,90,151,2.0,11/25/2016,"So we've tried to give this place a few months to settle in since they opened. We attempted to come previously a couple of months ago but they were closed due to a power outage. This time we had a large party on a Sunday afternoon. They restaurant was moderately busy, but not to capacity. We were immediately seated. It took approximately 20-30 minutes before anyone came to greet us or take our drink orders. The food arrived, but did not all come out at the same time. Disappointing service. Food was average.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-detroit
Kennedy C.,"Detroit, MI",0,1,1,1.0,10/5/2017,"I'm am ready to start a riot. I am currently sitting here at my table with my three friends. We understand that it's the the dollar margarita time and they ran out of it so it's gonna be a minute before they can bring us one. We understand that it's gonna be a slight wait for our food. That's all perfectly fine. So instead we ordered drinks off the menu that shouldn't have taken that long to come. WHATS NOT OKAY IS THE FACT THAT WE HAD BEEN SITTING THERE FOR ALMOST AN HOUR AND WE STILL HAD NOR RECEIVED ANY BEVERAGES. And then I look up, and the table that was seated THIRTY minutes after we came and they have margaritas. WE HADN'T EVEN RECEIVED THE REGULAR DRINKS WE ORDERED.  2. Our food. We ordered pretty basic food items. My one friend and I decided to get a two for twenty. Every one else's food comes. Two Cheesesticks, tenders, bbq wings and a whiskey burger. But my food never came. All I got was the bourbon chicken and shrimp with fries. My friends were pretty much done with their food, I'd sang a good THREE SONGS on karaoke and my food still had not come. Neither had our basic drinks. But ALL AROUND us people that had been served margaritas. The table that was right next to us had received there food. I had been there for an hour and twenty minutes and STILL NO FOOD OR DRINKS. It wasn't until we had said something to the manager (Christina) that we got our drinks. (That half of us sent back and one of us got remade) and my food finally came. However, by this time I'd lost my appetite and I was highly upset. We are not paying for ANYTHING in this establishment. And am absolutely appalled at the service of the bar staff, the kitchen, and the management. I have worked in food services before. In a MUCH smaller restaurant with WAY less staff and on a WAY  busier night. This is ridiculous. If I ever come back here it would be for the karaoke.  One more thing??

Vince V.,"Taylor, MI",265,4,,1.0,4/16/2017,Hands down the worst service ever while eating out. The server mostly ignored us. My drink came out half way through my meal even though I ordered it before my food.

Dustin G.,"Detroit, MI",0,7,1,5.0,5/12/2017,They completely rectified everything. I will come back here. Tiffany (bartender) and Clint (manager) really took care of me.

Joseph R.,"Farmington, MI",0,5,1,1.0,10/11/2017,"Do not go here unless you want a huge headache.  I have been here about 50 times and from the very beginning the service has been atrocious.  I mean the absolute worst you have ever had,  You can wait for an hour before someone gets to your table when they are very busy and that is not an exaggeration.  I have waited 20 minutes to get greeted at my table more than once and not when they are busy.  You can read my review on Google, I would frequent this place, knowing to expect poor service and I would just expect to spend extra time in there.  About 2 months ago I was getting a carside to go and waited 45 minutes because when I arrived there was a brawl outside and the employees were (rightfully so) too scared to bring my food outside during the fight.  Yesterday I went for my last time ever, I showed up at the carside at my pick up time and waited 20 minutes before going inside to pick up my cold food.  I never heard an apology and when I got home I realized they gave me the wrong food, completely.  These people do not deserve our patronage.  Stay away!  There are great, lesser known restaurants in Ferndale just down Woodward and they offer excellent service.  They are literally one mile away!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-detroit
Rusty S.,"Ferndale, MI",3,25,,1.0,4/23/2017,"Worst Applebees ever. Seems to be a recurring thing about the terrible service at this place.

Michelle R.,"New Orleans, LA",34,22,36,5.0,11/6/2015,"I typically wait a for reviews before trying out new spots, but I'm glad I went with my gut (pun intended) and dined at this new Applebee's. The experience made me so proud to have this new business in my neighborhood! I placed my order online. The site was user-friendly and it only took a few moments. It's always a bonus when you can set your pick-up time.  I arrived almost exactly on time and pulled into the ""curbside service only"" space. Lynnasia (hopefully I've spelled that correctly) came out immediately, charged my card and handed me my order. I was pleasantly surprised by her genuine, great service with a smile...this is the opposite of the horrid McDonalds on the other side.  My burger and our apps were all delicious. If I had to offer a negative, I'd say the burger was a little salty (I think it was the onion strings).  That's it. Great job!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-detroit

I lived on the other side of Woodward for the past 20 years before moving on and I always wished this HUGE parcel would get developed. Many stores and plenty of boom later I'm here at the first major chain since Red Robin. The place has the new Applebee's look and feel to it and the staff is really friendly.

Tha D.,"Detroit, MI",0,4,3,1.0,2/8/2017,"I was horribly disappointed with my service. I called in my order thinking I could just do a quick pickup and get home from the cold. I was wrong! I had to talk to three people including the manager just to place my order. First the young man didn't speak clearly nor with Any confidence he didn't even know what was on the menu. Then he gave the phone to a woman who couldn't stop chuckling and the both of them sounded as if they were flirting with each other in the background thinking it's cute neither could take the order over the phone. So I asked to speak with the manager. For some reason it was so hard to order two side orders. It's like they couldn't comprehend how to order  appetizer and a side order of something else. So finally the manager figures it out and gives the phone back to the original person who answered,.... well he's still confused even after the manager figured it out lol. We end up staying on the phone for almost 26 -30 mins trying to place an order. They said it would take 15-20 mins so we gave them a half hr, once we got there the food unfortunately was not ready. End up having to wait an extra 20-30 mins. And once we got home the food was cold. Even though I only stay about 7 mins away. So my question is, how many people does it take to place an order over the phone and why was the food cold if it was supposedly still being prepared once we got there. Horrible experience!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-detroit?start=20
