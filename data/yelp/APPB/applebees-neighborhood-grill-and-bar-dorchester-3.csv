Trung B.,"Boston, MA",0,46,2,1.0,2/27/2017,"This place is poorly ran by mgmt and I can tell staff hate to work there, but have to make their ends meet. Sat down with my family with young kids quite fast this time. Waitress Kimberley  F. served us and was quite nice and pleasant. I can see the hostess is being pushy ordering her around to clear the tables, but hello, she is serving us at the moment. She took our order and then told us that many items on the menu were out of the food, such as shrimp, kids chicken tenders, and a few entrees. Also, they were out of apple juice, which my two kids wanted. Ordered and substituted on the food selections as my kids were hungry. Food came at quite a good pace, but a little slower than what I have experienced at the Quincy Applebees. My food was dried as sh!t and I had to request gravy or some sauce just to moist my food (ordered the steak tips with mash potatoes and onion rings on top). The onion rings were not crunchy and were soaked in grease. The guests on the other table waited for more than an hour to be seated and for food to come out and they were heated and the table behind me had their orders mixed up with other patrons. First, I think mgmt needs to be retrained on how to manage a restaurant and how the kitchen functions, as when foods comes out,the servers are all taking random dishes and serving their customers. It was chaotic and unorganized restaurant/establishment. Pretty much the kitchen is hurting the servers on their performances and obviously they will be tipped less due to the unorganized kitchen. How on Earth a franchise be out of foods and not tell the servers ahead of time before customers order? This branch should be shut down due to lack of menu selections, poor kitchen quality foods, and unmanageable environment. It was one of the worst dinner I had with my family in my life!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dorchester-3?start=20

Maggie S.,"Boston, MA",0,8,,2.0,8/26/2016,"Eh. Id come here to get a beer/glass of wine and belly up to the bar but not much else.  I walked in and sat at the bar and ordered a house margarita. The bartender Kellee was incredibly nice and service was quick. She kept the bar clean and did a great job. That being said - the margarita was terrible. Not her fault but I couldn't even finish it. I ordered a tall glass of wine instead and got a great pour.  Ordered a few apps and was pretty disappointed in the size, presentation and taste of the food. The pretzels were falling off the plate, only got 5 tiny shrimp tossed haphazardly on the plate and just didn't taste all that great. I really wanted to enjoy this because the bartender was so good.

Erin O.,"Boston, MA",46,7,,2.0,12/27/2016,"My parents and I got takeout dinner here on Christmas Eve because it was the only place open near the hotel. I had the brunch burger and my parents shared the Southwestern Salad. We both ordered medium rare, but everything ended up pretty well done. We had emphasized that we wanted medium rare to the guy manning the takeout counter, and he definitely put it down, I guess the kitchen just doesn't know how to cook it. The burger was good otherwise, nothing special. The steak on the southwestern salad was so extremely tough though, you had to chew for a solid minute before you could swallow it. I don't think I've ever had such a tough steak. I also got an raspberry iced tea, which I thought was regular iced tea with a flavored syrup but tasted more like the cheap Brisk tea. My father and I had a cocktail each while waiting for the takeout, he had a Myers & Tonic and I had the raspberry cosmo. He said his was good, but I couldn't taste the alcohol in mine at all. For some people that's a good thing, but I like to know that I actually have alcohol in my drink if I'm paying $9 for it.

My fiancé and I travel to Boston/dorchester area on Wednesdays, and around 9/10 pm this is where we stop! Food is quick and that's a good thing sometimes. I just have to say, PHIL IS AWESOME!

I don't think we've ever had an issue. Maybe minor things here and there, but never anything that ruins our experience.

Steve L.,"Providence, RI",352,536,105,2.0,4/30/2012,"Generic Americana, done cheaply.  At least the beer's local. Most Applebees go out of their way to turn their local franchise into a tribute to the little town they occupy.  Take the franchise in my hometown of Yuba City, CA, for example, which features display cases of yearbook photos, Yuba City High School jerseys, and other elements of local charm.  Kitschy? Yes, but probably aimed at the appropriate target audience. This Applebee's fails even that, with wall decorations featuring rapidly obsolete scenes of Red Sox and Celtics glory, but nothing in particular celebrating Dorchester, or the expansive strip mall this franchise occupies. Food is the same old mediocre Applebee's.  Steaks taste (and probably are) brined, with sirloin cuts evoking the same mouthfeel and taste of mass market Chinese beef stir fry.  I bet the beef is sourced from the same place. Overall, I felt sadness after leaving the restaurant.  I couldn't help but feel bad that a trip to Applebee's is considered a treat in many parts of this country.  I suppose that makes me a snob.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dorchester-3?start=40

It's disgusting like seriously you guys need to train your stupid staff to carry the food with their hands UNDER the plate. I don't know where your fingers have been, I don't know if you even washed your hands, it's just disgusting. Do better. *EDIT I also forgot to add that the utensils are DISGUSTING. I understand it may be a pain in the ass to stand there and wash alllllll those dishes but when I picked up my spoon I noticed it had stains on it. It looks like they just water the utensils down and then put them back out. If you need to hire 10 people to wash and scrub dishes THEN DO IT. I don't want to eat my food with a fork or spoon that has stains on it from previous people using it. Literally made me want to puke. I ended up asking the waitress if they just had plastic utensils (the ones that come in the little bags). Ugh so disgusted.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dorchester-3
Elva L.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/17/2017,"Had a new definition of ""suck service"". My husband and I had a long day of moving to Boston, and this place is the nearest restaurant we could find. The waiter, male, around 50years old with glasses, was impatient to take our order, and it took him quite a long time to bring the food. What's worse, since the restaurant use an tablet-like screen on each table for customers to pay by themselves, I accidently hit 14% instead of 15% for the tips, which I didn't even realize that. When we about to leave, the waiter THROW the receipt on our table with a huge hand-draw CIRCLE of the suggested tips. When he passed by us, I heard him whisper ""F**K"" to us. I was so pissed off, but too tired to talk to his manager. But, it really hurt my first impression on Boston.  Never would come to this place again!!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dorchester-3
Ellen H.,"Beverly, MA",402,406,21,1.0,7/17/2016,"Why did I do this to myself? Well, actually I know exactly why. It's because I didn't feel like spending 2 hours in traffic when I could kill one having dinner and still make it home at the same time. I don't remember Applebee's sucking so hard. Maybe I've only ever had fried options so I was ill-prepared. I don't know. What I do know is I would have been better off at Olive Garden. Or the Pizza Hut Express in Target... Seriously. First of all, LOL at the sticky tables because according to my experience and prior reviews, these things have been sticky for years. Apparently same with the service: came in, empty lobby, went to bar area where one server said ""sit anywhere"", so I chose a 2-Top. Then the hostess came over and said ""Oh did you just walk in (like I wasn't supposed to). Sorry I was in the bathroom do you want a menu?"" .... Yes that sounds delightfully appetizing, thanks .... Best part of the experience was Howard, my server. Best manners I've ever encountered from a server or probably otherwise. He was just a nice guy and I always appreciate politeness, so thanks, Howard! Unfortunately, the food was laughable. My $11 salad was smaller than appetizer size. It was a single layer of lettuce on a plate, with cubed chicken (like the kind in a tub at Subway or something!), lackluster ingredients, and zero appeal. I ate it slowly while reading reviews of this place and it was still gone in 5 minutes and I'm still hungry, but refuse to shell out another penny for that quality of food. Blech. So, I obviously won't be coming back -- completely based on portions and food quality. ** Note: after I finished this review, I went to the bathroom, where one server was on her cellphone texting, clearly hiding from her manager. Meanwhile the bathroom was a hot mess. Went outside to leave and two more servers were standing right outside the building smoking and using less-than professional language. I'm not a Sensitive Sally, but talk like that either far away from the entrance, or on your own time! Dropped to 1 star!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dorchester-3

She bought over the wrong foods and tried to tell US that they were and that we ordered this even though we didn't. Plus the food was pretty basic. It was bland and nothing special like it usually is. It was not worth the price. This really turned me off from Applebee's, I used to love you guys so much but, it's time to say goodbye.

Service was friendly but slowwww. It was not crowded so I can't blame it on that. The burger and fries were ok but nothing special. Tasted like a standard frozen patty that is frozen with an odd shape to make it look like it was fresh. Fries heavily salted but satisfactory. In the end one of my biggest complaints was the electronic tablet menu/bill device. As far as my friend and I could tell there was no option to pay the bill in cash. We waited about five minutes for the server to return but they seemed to busy talking to members of the opposite sex.

Joshua S.,"Boston, MA",0,5,,1.0,12/21/2016,"If good service is important to you, don't bother coming to this location. Literally wasted an hour just now.  Sat down, our server got us our drinks and appetizer within the first 10 minutes. Then, she never stopped by our table again for the next 50 minutes, even when we pushed for the ""call server"" button after 20 minutes of waiting.  Our server literally walked around the divider in the middle of the restaurant instead of walking past our table. After she dropped off our appetizer she ran away like we had ahe plague (and we aren't even sick!). There were about 3 other servers who walked by our table and no one thought to ask if we were doing okay or went to get our server. After an hour we just paid and left.  Is it really THAT hard to just get our order? It takes like, less than a minute.. We went in being nothing but nice.  The pretzel and beer cheese appetizer was good though, but our server cost this location anything higher than a 1 star. The pretzels (and yelp, by mainly yelp) saved this location from getting no stars at all.

The place was just about empty yesterday afternoon.  If u do not use the computer like way of ordering u do not get waited on. I ordered onion soup, bowl, and salad. Salad was ok however my bowl of soup was half full and small. While everyone was nice but that did not make up for skimpy soup and ok salad. Had to get someone to get our waitress twice. Once when we were first seated. No one came. Had to get someone to find our waitress. Got a drink but had to flag her down again for another drink. To bad as they have what it takes but just seems as if the wait staff could care less about service. U will still be hungry when u leave. My sisters meal was ok.

Sasha M.,"Somerville, MA",149,141,219,2.0,1/5/2016,"Ok...so first off, I never liked Applebee's at all but I decided to come here with my sister last night on a whim because it was convenient. My sister wanted to sit at the lounge side instead of the restaurant and at most places we go to, you get to grab any seat or 2-top and the bar/lounge server will be there to service you.... My sister and I grabbed a 2-top and as I was putting my bag down, this man (server) told us to go back to the front and someone will seat us. Alright, so I was thinking, ""new policy? new thing? I never heard of it"" And as my sister and I were walking out to the front, the woman said, ""No, you can go back in and sit down wherever...you don't need us to seat you"" RED FLAG there for me...already I was getting bad vibes.  While we were waiting for a server, we saw that gentleman half ass walking toward us and then flagging down the other server to grab our table. I THINK that they don't do sections for bar areas, but I could be mistaken. He wasn't particularly friendly to us but was busy flirting with a hightop nearby most of the time we were there.  ANYWAY, I digress....our server was named Maria, she was the sweetest! I was so happy that she was our server instead of the man from before. I ordered a burger & fries which came out quickly and was very tasty. For drinks, I ordered a Gin Martini. I definitely should have thought twice on it because it was terrible to swallow but I forced myself to drink it. Maria asked me how it was and looked so worried so I told her it was fine because she was just so nice. I had to order a Sprite to chase my martini with.  Overall........Maria is the only reason why I even gave any stars to this place.

Sarah T.,"Boston, MA",80,2,,2.0,2/24/2016,"I didn't want to take to Yelp, but felt compelled to share our now 3 in a row negative South Bay Plaza Applebee's experiences.  I'm fully aware that Applebee's is not The Ritz, but my comments will have nothing to do with atmosphere or the food.  This restaurant is clean, spacious, and the food is good!  Prices are great.  The service and staff are what's bringing this Applebee's down.  My husband and I live in the area and Applebee's was our savior last winter during all the bad snowstorms.  We had a routine of digging out the car and heading over to Applebee's to enjoy the drink specials (how can you go wrong with a $4 house margarita/$3 Coors?) and tasty appetizers- we really had a good thing going for its convenience and price.  Consistent good food, clean, nice atmosphere.  Something must have changed over the course of the year (Staffing?  Management?) because our last 3 experiences have been frustrating.  I'd like to first share the night before Thanksgiving 2015- not a crowded night at Applebee's, plenty of staff on hand, we were quickly seated in the dining room.  After waiting at least 15 minutes for a server to come over to take our drink request, we put in an appetizer and then ordered our entrees to avoid another wait- we thought we were doing the server a favor.  Appetizer came out and my entree immediately followed, drinks brought over, though, we both asked twice for waters and never got them, but oh well.  The kicker is that my husband's entree never made it.  We both watched the server write it down and it never even came.  We waited, we drank, seeing if it would come--nope, just the check.  We weren't charged for it, so that was fine, we moved on and were over it and ready to leave. Because it's a convenient, clean restaurant for a cheap tasty meal, we went back.  Seated in the bar area this time and had the nicest, most attentive server ever.  I wish I could remember her name so I could give her a shotout for doing her job and doing it wonderfully.  Things were fine.  Put our drinks in, got plenty of water, and ordered an appetizer and entrees.  Everything came out fine, except my husband got the wrong entree.  No problem, our server totally made up for it with her awesome customer service.  What really sealed the deal for us, was a recent night at Applebee's this February.  We waited about 20 minutes for a table, which was fine, it was Friday night after all, and were seated in the dining room.  Waited at least 20 minutes to be acknowledged by a server, put our drinks and appetizer in.  My husband's drink came over and was in a pint glass with red lipstick on it.  Not the server's fault, but come on.  Gross.  We waited so long for those drinks!  Luckily, another one quickly made it over.  Got our appetizer, put our entrees in, and were hoping for more drinks.  But our server was nowhere to be found.  By the time he came back around, we were both over it and ready to go home, so just asked for to go boxes because we had fully digested in the amount of time it took him to come back over to us- never apologizing for the wait or even asking if we needed anything else.  The to-go boxes never made it and the server disappeared again.  When I was about to get up and ask a hostess for boxes, he conveniently came back, so we grabbed the boxes and got out of there.  I just can't take the lack of customer service here--it kills me, because we really liked this Applebee's location.  If it's understaffed on a Friday night, then that needs to be addressed by Management.  People go out to eat because they want a night off from the usual routine.  They want to relax, have drinks and food with friends/family--it's a shame to see this Applebee's go under because of the poor service.  Is it a training issue?  Why are the servers so poorly trained and inattentive?  I will also add, we always left the servers 20% tips despite their sub-par service- people have off days and I know it's a living, but we just can't take it anymore and won't be coming back.  We haven't escalated our issues to Management because by the time our servers come to our attention, we just want to leave and go home without causing a fuss.  I get it, this industry can be overwhelming, but customer service is a fundamental principal of any occupation.  End rant. Get it together, Applebee's, you can be so much better!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dorchester-3?start=60

We asked multiple staff members who told us they would change the channel and didn't. We finally asked for the restaurant manager-- he came by-- refused to give direct eye contact, was dismissive of our request-- and told us he needed to speak to the bartender he wasn't sure if they were able to change the channel--  he never checked back in with us-- but 10 minutes later all of the TVs in the entire restaurant portion-- not the bar were changed to NASCAR....

I think she was chillin with the kitchen staff or something . I asked her why it take so long she said the kitchen was backed up ..no way I took a bite of my burger it was so hot I spit it out .it was microwaved .then they left a huge mess beside us at a different table she walked past it and didn't care I had to move a high chair so someone can get by in a wheel chair they just looked at me even the waitress didn't care so sad. I say our waitress was nice but LAZY .,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dorchester-3?start=60
Emily D.,"Quincy, MA",251,394,942,2.0,4/14/2011,"What in the hellzzzz was I even thinking coming to Applebee's. No, wait. I blame my husband.. he suggested it. We both had a momentary lapse of judgment.  We order our food. We decided to choose off the 2 for $20 menu. Honestly, the food is not worth more than $20.  We had the boneless BBQ wings for app. - overly breaded chicken smothered in tangy BBQ sauce. My question is.. where's the chicken? It was mostly all breading and it wasn't even hot. It was room temperature.  For our entree- I ordered the chicken and shrimp and substituted the potatoes for veggies. They brought out a skillet with chicken and 4 tiny shrimps soaking in oil with onions and mushrooms and a huge broccoli stalk sitting in the oil as well. Really, I prefer not to have my veggies soaked in oil.. thanks. I couldn't finish my food. The chicken was ok, but I was feeling icky from all the oil. I ate all the mushrooms and broccoli.  The hubby had the riblets and fries. He enjoyed his riblets but the fries were cold and rubbery.  Honestly, applebee's is really only good for their drinks and maybe desserts. They have tons of different cocktail options and even low cal cocktails like the skinny margarita.  Waitress was friendly and sweet, I can't blame her for the crappy food.

Eric S.,"Boston, MA",20,286,26,2.0,3/28/2011,"Why does this place have an aversion to hot food? This place gets two stars based on the service, not so much the food.  If rated on the food alone, it would get one star. After leaving Boston Bowl with a group of coworkers, we decided to go to Olive Garden.  It was 9PM, Olive Garden closed at 11, and we were told that it would be at least an hour until we were seated.  We said screw it, let's go to Applebee's. We walked in with our group of 11.   The guy at the door said that it will be at least 20 minutes.  10 minutes later, we were told that a group came in before us and had just been seated so it will take even longer.  A woman came out from the bar area and said that there were three booths available if we didn't mind splitting up. So, we split up into three booths and ordered drinks.  The mango iced tea is amazing! Then, we ordered our food.  I ordered an appetizer sampler, a bowl of chowder, and a fried chicken salad. The bowl of chowder came first.  Unfortunately, Applebee's had underestimated how much experience that I've had with a microwave.  The chowder was warm on top, and cool in the middle and bottom.  Definitely microwaved. Then, the appetizer sampler came.  None of it was hot except for the spinach and cheese dip.  The mozzarella sticks were cold, the bacon and cheese quesadilla was cold, and the boneless wings were deliciously microwaved quality. Then, the salad arrived.  Half of the veggies were wilted.  Come on!  Even Mcdonalds can make a better salad at half the price!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dorchester-3?start=60

My friend was fed up. When our sweet waiter came back, my friend asked for our check.

Reneé R.,"Boston, MA",33,39,6,2.0,6/29/2010,"Applebees, one of the top chain restaurants in the United States. Promising delectable dishes at cheap prices. Too bad when my mom and I walked into this one and decided to have dinner, the latter rang true and only that.  Before I get to how insanely awful our food was, I would like to mention  the overall decorative design of the place. Attempting to have a conversation with my mom over what to order, I found myself being distracted and disgusted by the 1980s poster of New Kids On The Block. There's just nothing appealing about looking at Marky Marc's chest hair when deciding between chicken fingers and a burger. The other posters of local celebrities weren't as disturbing. They just need to update the place and consider their customer's sensitive stomachs.  The wait for our food, didn't take too long. I figured out why, my mom's order was completey wrong in every way possible and my chicken tenders tasted like they were leftovers that they  heated up in an easy bake oven for 10 minutes. The fries were confusing, some were crispy while others were saggy.  My public high school cafeteria had better fries than this. We got through a few minutes of our meals, toughing through, not wanting our money to go to waste and we finally decided to ask for the check. The two stars for the restaurant is for the waiter. He was very nice and made me feel guilty about not taking my leftovers home.  I know that there are certain expectations of chain restaurants and I shouldn't have such high hopes, but  this Applebee's didn't even live up to the minimum expectations. Applebee's needs to be redmodeled and the food should match it's waiters.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dorchester-3?start=80

Chris C.,"South End, Boston, MA",138,119,,1.0,12/18/2010,"Closing out the holiday season with a change of pace. Tonight, by request of a friend, I review a chain restaurant in my surrounding neighborhood-Applebee's. Located in the South Bay Shopping Center in Dorchester, Applebee's is one of the available places to eat in the nearby area. There is also an Olive Garden right next to it, and along Massachusetts Avenue, there is Victoria's Diner, Hen House, McDonald's and other places to eat (cannot remember them all at this time). Most people come in the area to shop at one of the big name stores such as Best Buy, Target, Home Depot, Famous Footwear, or even do grocery shopping at Stop & Shop. The atmosphere is very casual. Families, friends, co-workers and others can come and eat or relax and enjoy the game on the TV. At this location, there is various local memorabilia along the wall, such as the Red Sox, New Kids on the Block, and New Edition. Our server's name was Brittany. She was fairly attentive, quick, and polite in serving us tonight. Applebee's menu is pretty wide in terms of selection. I wouldn't know how to describe what their menu is overall or compare it to other chain restaurants, but there are plenty of choices to choose from. They also have multiple specials where you can mix and match entrees, so that's a plus. I chose the 2 for $20 deal, which is an appetizer and your choice of 2 entrees from a section for $20. From that, I had the Boneless Wings, Fettucine with Provolone-Stuffed Meatballs, and Riblet Basket (Ribs with your choice of sauce and fries) The confusing or bad part of the review starts here though. The boneless wings were spicy but warm in terms of temperature. The fettucine had good taste and wasn't too thin or overly thick in its sauce, but the top layer was warm. Only the center was even close to being hot. Some of the noodles were also stuck together as if they were frozen. The same goes for the meatballs. The riblets were overcooked (one could tell from the dried appearance of the meat) as well as the fries. I ended up packing all the food for take-out to 1) not waste it and 2) to perhaps salvage it in my house by recooking.  Overall, there's better options for food. Even going to the supermarkets next door and preparing something at home would be more fulfilling and cheaper than eating at this dining establishment. If you're looking for a place to relax and have a good time with friends and others, Applebees is the place to go. Otherwise, save your dollars for shopping.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dorchester-3?start=80

It is generally friendly, and we were seated in an enormous booth, with a great view of the. Olive Garden. Although the booth could have easily sat 30, we were comfortable. However, seated next to us was a loud woman. Applebee's is responsible for my broken eardrums. Onward to the meal. The boneless buffalo wings were adequately boneless. However, we ordered mild, and what we got was nothing short of fire. I survived. We ordered many things, including the Orange Crispy Chicken. The chicken was fair to good, but was sitting on a swamp of rice. I was confused, and think it must have been a mistake. The gorgonzola pecan/walnut salad was great, but a little cheese heavy. That's probably not what Olive Garden would do. The fajitas, which seemed to be the only vegetarian meal, was way oversalted. Overall, the experience was not terrible.

The waitress sat around a table with her friends pretty much the whole time not to mention she looked completely doped out. The environment sucked. Bill came to $40 for me & my boyfriend..terrible mistake, wasnt even worth it. go nextdoor to olive garden if you want a good meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dorchester-3?start=100
John Paul N.,"Boston, MA",16,78,,1.0,3/1/2009,"I didn't want to do a review of Applebees, ashamed that we actually dined here last Thursday night, but our experience was so bad that we had to let the public know. As far as chains goes, Applebees is probably my least favorite.  I have Red Robin and Chili's well ahead it.  Let me also preface this review by saying we only went to Applebees because we had a plan to go to South Bay to pick up some DVDs that just came out and go to Stop and Shop for some groceries to make dinner, but I had to work late so by the time we got to South Bay, both of us were starving and we decided to settle for Applebees. We've been to this Applebees once before and it was a horrible experience.  Fool me once, shame on you... So we sit at the bar area at some hightops and it takes us forever to make up our minds on what we want.  That's our own fault.  Finally I decided on the 9 oz steak with topped off baked potato, with instructions for the steak to be medium rare and the potato to not have sour cream.  Abby got some herb chicken thing.  And so we waited...and waited...and waited.  Finally the waiter comes by and tells us that our meal is coming out shortly.  This is a tactic I don't understand at all.  If our food is coming out shortly, then just bring it out, don't tell us in advanced.  I mean, is that suppose to make us feel better?  All I know is we waited another 10 minutes and no food.  Our waiter did come out to tell us that our dinner was being plated right now and should be out soon.  I really wished he didn't tell me that, because it took nearly another 10 minutes before our food was being brought out.  The gave me time to think that my steak was probably getting overcooked by sitting under the heatlamp.  Sure enough, our food comes out and there's sour cream on my potato.  (Oh yeah, the waiter didn't write down our order either, he was one of those ""I'll remember it all"" types.)  I mention this and the runner said she can take it back.  I'm so hungry, I really don't care.  That's when I decided to check my steak, and sure enough, tougher than a boot's sole and well overdone.  I tell her I ordered medium-rare and she said she'll have them refire a steak.  Fine, I can live with that.   Again, we wait for what seems like forever.  A 9oz steak cooked at medium-rare should take 8 minutes top.  After 20 or so minutes, and two different people assuring me that my food was coming out soon, we decided we had enough and that we wanted to speak to the manager.  He comes out and says that the steak is almost ready, but I tell him we just want to pay for Abby's meal and to leave.  He tells me the steak will be free and we can take it to go, but I really don't want it.  I tell him no and that we just want our check and want to  leave.  He says to not worry about the bill but if I wanted to leave a tip for the waiter that would be great.  Normally I wouldn't leave squat, but I felt this time it wasn't the waiter's fault and leave him a couple of bucks. Fool me twice, shame on me.  It was our own fault to go to Applebees.  We know their food suck and their service is just as bad.  However, it shouldn't take an hour to get a medium rare steak out to a customer, not once, but twice.  I give Applebees at South Bay a 0 out of 5.  (I gave it a one, but it's really a 0.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dorchester-3?start=100
