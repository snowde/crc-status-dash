La Vonia D.,"Douglasville, GA",0,11,14,4.0,8/8/2017,The food was average but good for a quick family dinner on a school night.  Trey was our server and was awesome and great at delivering pleasant service.  All of the other team members we encountered were friendly and helpful.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-douglasville-3
Jai S.,"Lithia Springs, GA",7,88,43,1.0,10/15/2017,"Yesterday my kids and I walked in at 1:42pm. We sat for a while nobody came to the table. So I asked the hostess who was the server for the table she told me the name and said she'd be right with us.  So we waited a few moments more, the hostess came back and offered to get our drink order. We gave it to her. Waited longer and still no server.  we walked out. When we left it was 2:01. I used to serve and no where ever should it take that long to greet your table. Especially when you're not busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-douglasville-3
Nysa T.,"Fairburn, GA",0,8,1,1.0,6/30/2017,"Wow. This restaurant clearly doesn't care about making money. I came in with my family, just the three of us, and we were completely ignored. The host lazily showed us to a table, and for the next several minutes, servers walked back and forth past our table, and said nothing...(the restaurant was nearly empty, can't even blame it on a crowd.) After being ignored, we decided to leave. On the way out we told the host that no one bothered to help us and his response was ""I'm sorry, have a good night"". He didn't even ask us to stay, or anything. He simply showed us out the door.  Needless to say we will NOT be returning to this Applebees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-douglasville-3

Gary H.,"Dallas, GA",0,10,10,1.0,12/20/2016,I think the other post on here are dead on! Server is nice but that's about it. Took forever to even get our drink. Then took forever for the server to return to take our order. Took forever for our appetizer to come out. When it did maybe 5 minutes later our meals come out. The plate was extremely hot but the food........ Luke warm at best. Asked for a refill on my tea. Nope. They had only brought us one napkin. Asked for more. Nope. Service was awful. Food tastes ok but not hot. Just lousy service. Wonder if the manager ever reviews this? Maybe he and the district should.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-douglasville-3
Destiny M.,"Douglasville, GA",31,1,,1.0,10/29/2017,"Definitely not the experience I was expecting. We came in at 30 minutes to close and had to wait forever to be seated with plenty of seating available. Then the server forgot we were even over here. Took our orders and had quite an attitude problem. Served us terrible tea, and gave us an attitude for asking for a change of drink. Our server continually kept kicking my cousin when she would come by and my cousin just had surgery. And refills were non existent. Plus once we made a complaint with the manager, he still sent her to our table. Smh. What's corporate's number?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-douglasville-3

After complaining to the hostess ( waitress was no where to be found) we were told our food had come up along with several other orders. It was cold to the touch. We asked for to go boxes.

Mike S.,"Douglasville, GA",0,1,,1.0,12/27/2016,I travel a lot and eat at Applebee's quite a bit. I have never had to wait for 10 min. to even see a host/ess to be seated. We followed another party that had been waiting to order for 30 min. No attempt was made to serve us or apologize for the lack of service. Not going back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-douglasville-3
David M.,"Douglasville, GA",0,1,,1.0,5/1/2017,Cold steak. Mushy veggies. Dirty plates. Too many other restaurants near by to put up with those issues. Don't expect much if you come here.

Auston R.,"Villa Rica, GA",3,71,312,1.0,8/8/2016,Ok came back for a second shot and was let down first off or waiter was very nice but this as good as it gets the chicken wonton tacos were to sweet for my taste and my brew house chicken was so black I thought it was steak I took a bite and it was like eating rubber not good!!

Tammye G.,"Douglasville, GA",51,1,,1.0,12/20/2016,Could this place be any more awful if it tried???    Sat for an hour waiting for food that came cold.  My child's steak was like charcoal so they brought her a corn dog that was still frozen in the middle along with cold French fries.  Very poor attempts by management to make it right.  Only after getting slightly rude with management did they comp our whole ticket.  Will NEVER eat Applebees again!!  Really should be able to give negative star ratings.   A zero star rating is a compliment for this place!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-douglasville-3
Miles A.,"Winston, GA",35,3,1,1.0,3/25/2016,"Applebee's didn't do their best to day. Food was average at best, my mojito had a garden of mint in it, and the service was subpar. Not their best day.

Merin G.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,13,1,3.0,11/5/2016,Waitress was nice. Food was OK.

Shandra E.,"Douglasville, GA",0,20,2,1.0,12/21/2016,"I would leave 0 if possible.This is the second time ive had a bad experience at this location.. Apparently Im too white to be served.Everyone else was served except me,I sat at the bar I was never greeted.I had to find a server to get a menu and no it wasnt busy..I finally ordered a long island ice tea and when she finally brought my drink back she asked if I was ready to order.I said no a few more minutes...that did not mean sit there with 2 other employees and talk about how messed up you got last night loud enough for the bar to hear..not to mention she made eye contact several times before leaving the bar...I had 2 drink of my long island said ypu know what and left ....I have never actually yes this has happened once before at this same   NOT GO THERE!  I will never step foot in   just amazes me how I was ignored opposed to everyone else and its the second time so I have to say it is skin color!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-douglasville-3
Au N.,"Fredericksburg, VA",40,7,1,1.0,6/24/2016,"If 0 stars were possible, that's what they would receive. Food took over 40 mins to come, the steak was over cooked and my husband's chicken had sauce, which he stated that he didn't want. The manager is a joke. After the terrible service, she still expected me to pay for the appetizer, that came with our 2/$25. Once I refused, she then threatened to call the cops. Followed us outside saying, it's only $20 and I can't believe you're acting that way, and with a child. Very unprofessional, even after my husband tried to speak calmly to her. She then said she never wants to see us there again, well no worries about that, because you're definitely on the banned list. Worse experience ever!  13yr loyal customers and it's over because of one persons antics.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-douglasville-3
Lee T.,"Douglasville, GA",6,156,90,2.0,4/14/2015,"We have ate here a few times and each time we leave feeling disappointed. Every time we have been here, one of the items we would like, they will be out of. The service is ALWAYS slowwwwwww. We will get our drinks and then it takes a while to ever get the food we order, no matter how busy or slow they are. The food is fine but nothing special, the menu has a lot to offer and maybe that is part of their problem. They seem to be trying to cater for every possible taste and while offering a big selection of items sounds good, it seems to come at the cost of maintaining quality. Maybe this saying comes best to describing Applebee's ""Jack of all trades and master of none""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-douglasville-3
Constance B.,"Villa Rica, GA",60,9,27,3.0,7/30/2016,The wait in the food was okay...

Nobi B.,"Douglasville, GA",0,15,3,1.0,5/31/2015,"Don't go to this establishment. We came there on a Saturday night with a group of friends w/kids. I didn't know it was ""the club"" on Saturday night but I quickly learned. Club music turnt up. Drunk ppl singing. The place was in disarray, the bathroom was dirty, the carpets soiled & the whole place just smelled foul. Against my better judgement we stayed because of the 1/2 off appetizers promotion & we had hungry kids with us.  It took a good 30 minutes just to get food + drinks ordered. Another 30 to actually eat. Meanwhile I'm sitting there looking like why am I here?? The quesadilla appetizer was palatable, but I couldn't eat the spinach dip I ordered. It was just nasty.

Eric B.,"Douglasville, GA",0,4,,1.0,1/20/2017,"This place sucks ASS. I ordered a burger and it came out extra dry and burned. Why can't you just go out and have a decent burger without having to eat fast food. Asked for the manager and after about 10 minutes she showed. To top it all off I wasn't the only one.

Maggi S.,"Villa Rica, GA",7,5,,1.0,1/4/2016,My husband and I went for dinner and drinks with 3 gift cards that totaled $65. Service was ok but when the $51 check came I failed to notice before our server took the cards that there was $9.99 extra on our check. I pointed it out to our server when she returned with the receipt that said we had $8.67 on our gift card. She got the manager involved and after 30 min and my husband walking back to see what was going on he said all of the cards were 0 out and he would make the server pay the $20!

Andrew P.,"Douglasville, GA",2,82,14,1.0,11/13/2012,"It was toss up between 1 and 2 stars, but opted for the 1 because this joint has gone down hill since I last visited (and I don't come here much). I know things are going to start off bad when we walked in and saw the whole wait staff at the bar eating and act surprised when customers walk in the the door. They all scurried about like roaches with the lights turned on, a server guided us to a table and the slow service began. Drinks and the appetizer came out fast, as expected. But then there was a long lapse of waiting.... and waiting.... We had ordered salads for lunch, my friend orderd a spinach with fruit and I had fiesta chicken with tomato basil soup. It took about 30 minutes to bring out the salads. Seriously, salads. The fruits in my friend's salad were still frozen, so much for freshness. While my salad did have some flavor, it was edible but it didn't fix my appetite.  We left disappointed, stomachs half empty and hit the road looking for better eats. Whether its poor management, lack of good service or no idea how to operate a functioning restaurant... I got to say this place can go away. Its a good place for drinks, but just don't order any food that has to be prepared.  Downgrade",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-douglasville-3?start=20

We keep trying to give them the benefit of the doubt and continue to visit and the service is consistently poor and the food is not great to begin with but my son surprisingly likes their steaks and I like the blondie dessert. Just had to walk out after sitting for 10 minutes and no one even took our drink order.  We still sat there after I informed the greeter and she retrieved our drinks and apologized. Still no one came to take our food order and we were 15+ minutes in at this point. Just had to leave.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-douglasville-3?start=20
N F.,"Villa Rica, GA",0,5,,1.0,5/17/2014,"I Believe that a 1 star is too high of a rating for this Applebees, but there wasn't a no star. The food tasted completely generic. The alcoholic beverages tasted that we got tasted like a virgin fruit punch beverage. And the appetizer took like 30 minutes to come out and when it did it was like a watery version of an artichoke spinach dip. We use to come here for the Great Happy Hour, but that's LONG GONE!

E M.,"Douglasville, GA",106,67,30,1.0,2/26/2011,"Having visited various Applebee's at least a few times, I know what to expect.  It has always been good food for the type of place it is Last night, my boyfriend and I both ordered the Cajun Shrimp Pasta with Mozzarella sticks as an appetizer.  He also ordered a side salad and a side of meatballs.   The only things we enjoyed were the Mozzarella sticks and the side salad. The Cajun Shrimp Pasta was just gross.  First of all the plates looked disgusting, like they were dirty.  I'm assuming it was just some of the sauce that managed to get all around the sides and somehow dried there before the plates reached our table, I hope!  The shrimp looked pale and white like they had been boiled and not properly seared.  The whole dish was just drowning in the Cajun sauce which initially looked watery and gross.  The seasoning was just some hard flakes in a cream type sauce. I must say this was the worst thing we ever ate at an Applebee's.  We spent almost $50 on nasty food. We ate at the bar.  When we first arrived the bartender was very attentive.  But once we asked for menus, it seemed like he forgot we existed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-douglasville-3?start=20
Honest A.,"Douglasville, GA",0,3,,1.0,2/3/2014,"Worst Applebee's I've ever been to. I went to this Applebee's' on my first day staying in Douglassville. It was on a Thursday. As soon as my friend and I walked into this restaurant, music was playing with a DJ. I'm like ""you've got to be kidding me"". Why in the world is a DJ playing loud unnecessary music. I could barely hear the waiter. When I got seated, my seat was torn up. The table wasn't even cleaned properly and the food wasn't even good. Example, I bought the sliders with French fries on the side. The cooks cooked the sliders and let them get cold on my plate while the French fries were still getting ready. Cold sliders with hot fresh fries. I also ordered Mozzarella sticks and they were still cold. The only thing I enjoyed was the boneless hot wings. Other than that, everything else was terrible. The waiter even said, ""this is rachet night"". I could never see a family come into this restaurant. This Applebee's needs a new manager because he or she obviously let's the employees do whatever the heck they want.
