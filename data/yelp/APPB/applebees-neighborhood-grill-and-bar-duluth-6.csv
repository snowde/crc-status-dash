Ashbeezy B.,"Suwanee, GA",1586,375,6404,4.0,12/18/2017,"After a long day on the media circuit, it was was time to unwind. A colleague and I decided to meet up at Applebee's. I recently heard about their new Topped Steak & Twisted Potatoes Menu. Sounded interesting. Oh I was in for a big surprise.   Our usual hangout is the Applebee's on Pleasant Hill Rd. in Duluth, Ga. Its in a great proximity to the movies and popular shopping outlets. I grew up in this area so its always like coming home.   This unique menu features a 6 ounce or 8 ounce USDA choice top sirloin. Only the cream of the crop for their customers. The options for toppers are mouthwatering. Tavern mushroom & onion, Savory herb & butter sauce and lastly creamy horseradish & gravy. But wait. There is so much more.    Things get real creative when it comes to the potatoes. The classic favorite is the garlic mashed potatoes. Live a little on the wild side with Twisted tots and loaded potato casserole. In addition to this, you have an option for vegetables.    A mountain of food weighed our table down. Savory herb & butter sirloin dazzled on a plate with a hearty side of twisted tots and grilled veggies. The aroma was intoxicating. I didn't think Applebee's was known for its steak. And what an impressive display it was.   My colleague chose a sirloin topped with Tavern mushrooms & onion. It was garnished with fresh broccoli and that tasty potato casserole. Both steaks were cooked to perfection and bursting with flavor.    I was tempted to venture into dessert. I am absolutely in love with the triple chocolate meltdown. However, my stomach was well past capacity at the close of this evening. My friend was on the same page and was full too.   The price of these menu items is far lower than the value. Want more food for your bucks? Visit your neighborhood store for the Topped Steak & Twisted Potatoes! Kudos to Applebee's on an incredible promotion. We will be back!   #Applebees #ToppedSteaksandTwistedPotatoes #ashsaidit",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-duluth-6
Christine T.,"Lawrenceville, GA",96,20,20,1.0,10/6/2017,Worse place to eat with the worst food. Our server Kachae C was a terrible a server. Well she wasn't even taking care of us.  Another server Courtney had to take care of us she was amazing. So we gave the cash tip to her. Kachae C had the nerve to ask me how old I was out of no where. Took my friends drink while cleaning the table when she wasn't even done !!  The food and service come on now.  Now I gotta go eat somewhere eles.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-duluth-6
Adalys S.,"Atlanta, GA",0,2,,1.0,12/31/2017,If I could give this place no stars I would! My sister in laws purse went missing. She called Apple Bees to see if it was there they told her it wasn't. Later on in the day they called her saying her purse was found but without the wallet. Not to mention there was $300 in her wallet. So she called the police but conveniently her section was out of sight from the cameras. So since there is nothing we can do I'm going to write this review because what happened was shady and this establishment sucks. Don't waste your time and if you do keep your things close to you.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-duluth-6
LaShonda H.,"Marietta, GA",201,301,939,1.0,4/14/2017,"I wish I could give this place -1 stars. I'll give them 1 star because the good was decent. The service here is TERRIBLE. Our server waited 15 minutes to come by the table and greet us. All the while he's checking on two other tables in our vicinity. How hard is it to take a drink order and check on your other two tables who are already eating?  He finally comes to the table and at that point my friend is pissed.  His whole demeanor was playful as if he thought we were all old pals. He cracked too many jokes for me. Can't you tell we're not in the mood for that? We quickly ordered food and drinks and the waiter  seemed to handle that fine. Our salads come out and he didn't check us on one time. Once our entrees came out he asked did we want to try the new grateful dead drink. I declined but my friend ordered one.  I had the cilantro lime chicken and switched the rice for fries. The chicken was seasoned well and was pretty juicy. I love the fries here. After my friend gave him the drink order, We watched him walk around and around the restaurant, chatting it up with all of his co-workers and other tables. Comes back 15 minutes later and asks how we're doing?! Ummm waiting on the drink! He says oh let me see what's taking so long. Dude you never put the order in!!! He comes back with the drink and tries to blame the bartender. I was so ready to go. Especially when he kept describing the drink as a grape popsicle. Smh. Applebees, the food waa decent but just wasn't worth the crappy service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-duluth-6

The  service was really good our waiters name was Damien or something like that and he was fast friendly and courteous. Also the food was really good that was actually the best part the presentation the color and the flavor of the food was really on point my son and I both ordered the grilled chicken and shrimp on a stick,, it was brought out by two neatly dressed people I'm not sure who they were but the way they brought the food out and presented it to us was impressive.  I can tell that Applebees is really trying to get better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-duluth-6
Lucinda Y.,"Lawrenceville, GA",0,2,1,2.0,10/6/2017,"I went to eat here with my best friend and it took about 7 minutes for our server to come over. After we ordered it took about 10 minutes for us to get our lemonades. I'm not sure if our server had too many tables but she seemed too busy. When we finally received our food from another server, our original server finally came to check on us again.

Ziggy S.,"Atlanta, GA",7,81,,1.0,10/15/2016,"One of my guilty pleasures in life is to read reviews of Applebees restaurants. I highly recommend it! You can read reviews from Anchorage to Miami, and they're all the same; food is cold, service is incredibly slow, and managers are pricks. One of the mysteries of the ages is how this company stays in business. The other mystery is why people continue to eat there. Their new promotion has cost them tens of millions of dollars. Most of the restaurants now have wood-fired grills installed. It will simply add an extra step for the ex-Burger King chef to get that chicken breast a little bit smoky before it's slapped in the microwave and then sentenced to a slow death under the warming lamp while said high school chef heads outside to smoke a blunt.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-duluth-6
Marie C.,"Buckhead, Atlanta, GA",0,12,,1.0,9/12/2017,I went there last weekend. There was a bug in my drink. I exchanged it for another. Then I asked for cheddar cheese in my burger. They brought the burger with a different cheese. I ask for my cheddar cheese. The server came back like 20 minutes later to tell me that American cheese is there only one they have in Applebee's. By then my food was cold. I was so mad. I literally always come here and get cheddar every time. To make matters worse there was a roach crawling across the ceiling. They did nothing about it. I was a regular because it was close by and closes late but not anymore. Very disappointed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-duluth-6

Me and my friends usually choose music from the iTunes box whole waiting for our food. We usually get a burger or the baby back ribs and the food always tastes good.

Michelle F.,"Lawrenceville, GA",0,5,,2.0,11/12/2016,"I gave this place two stars because of what it used to be. This review is not just based on this final visit but from the last two times that I visited this location hoping things would improve.  Maybe it's the time I visit but they always seem short staffed. The front is disorganized and unkempt. After waiting for five minutes and deciding to leave, the waitress came to our table. She was pleasant enough but seemed distracted. The food is not the quality it used to be. It seems as if the kitchen is taking a lot of short cuts. We had the 2 for 25.00 deal. I ordered the ribs with mashed potatoes and broccoli. The order came with an appetizer. The appetizer was brought out the same time as the food. The broccoli was overnuked and tasteless, the mashed potatoes tasted like dirt and the ribs were underwhelming.  Why the current manager of this once thriving restaurant would feel so complacent about poor reviews baffles me. Maybe he/she can ask the staff to clean the food stains off the blinds in the meantime while trying to figure out how to bring this restaurant back up to the standard it once was.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-duluth-6
Jennifer H.,"Atlanta, GA",216,89,572,1.0,10/14/2012,"Came here for a late lunch with someone else and we both ordered a chicken salad each as we wanted an easy dish before we started on our road trip. There weren't many people when we were at this location. However, we waited a very, very long time for our salads to come out. Gosh, were they trying to catch the chicken? Why make us wait 40 minutes for just our salads? We were so annoyed at the waiter who did not apologize for the long wait. Just as we were about to walk out the door, the waiter came out with our salads. We politely got back to our seats. I thought salads were pre-made and cut before hand. It is not that hard to put a salad together, guys. Applebee, please get it together and give me a break! Yelp 7/365",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-duluth-6?start=40

Alan T.,"Atlanta, GA",32,19,11,1.0,2/13/2016,"Went there for the Super Bowl and was forced out at 9:30 pm by our rude server. (This place says it closes at 2?) My group and I were having a great time, but then our server ruins our entire experience. A few of us were still eating, but she came and started taking EVERYTHING off our table. She took all the plates, small plates, and then she took away everyone's water! Even the waters of the people STILL eating!! She wasn't giving refills because she put the utensils and trash into the cups. We didn't say we were even done or wanted our checks. She stood there at our table after giving out the checks and made us hurry up and give her our credit cards. My friend was eating and didn't notice that our server was eyeing her down and trying to make her pay so I decided to pay for my friend so the server would stop being so rude and leave. She then brings the checks and stands there waiting for us to tip her..... After we put the tips and signed the merchant copies, we gave her the copies and she left. Remember a couple of my friends aren't done eating. THEN she comes back with a broom and starts sweeping all around us. She then bangs the broom very hard and loudly on one of my friend's chair that is eating!!! After she hit my friend's chair with a broom, we left. This was the absolute worst experience we have ever had at a restaurant. We couldn't even finish watching the Super Bowl cause our server was trying to push us out of the restaurant. Also there was no line of people trying to get into the restaurant at the time. There were empty tables around so we didn't understand why we were being rushed. Oh and when we left, there were so many people still in the restaurant drinking their drinks and enjoying the Super Bowl. Never coming back here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-duluth-6?start=40
Britni A.,"Lawrenceville, GA",1,7,,1.0,3/20/2015,"Best word to describe this place is, WAIT. Hope your not hungry or anything. And when you do get your food i hope everything you need is already there because surprise surprise be prepared to WAIT! So honestly before you get your food go ahead and get up, walk out that door, hop in the car and drive on down to the waffle house, its 5 lights down on your right. Atleast  they can see that you cant eat because they forgot silverware and youve been waiting for 20 minutes AND atleast they would feel bad an apologize maybe even ""correct"" the check.

Monica U.,"Atlanta, GA",7,16,67,1.0,10/3/2016,"Absolutely terrible. We had a table of 7 called in to have a table ready, gladly got seated. Drinks were taken, and our server seemed a little off. Finally got our order in, waited 40 mins. Finally got it and during that wait we all had finished our beverages. Even after we got our food not once did he check on us nor did he fill up our drinks. (Ate our food without drinks) Also some of the foods were cold- not only that he can laugh and take his time with the other tables but with ours no? An extra 15 to get to go boxes and checks but most of us did the 2 for 20 or 25. He got the checks wrong- had to take more time to do that. My co worker went up to the cash register to ask him a question and he didn't respond to her face. While my other two co workers left and he had to go drinks in hand they kindly asked if they can take it and we would pay at the table cause they had to go. I watched and saw him shaking his head silently cursing to himself cause he was Ina bad mood. There's more to this but overall horrible and yet we still left decent tip. Server name Randy G.

Renee K.,"Acworth, GA",204,162,47,3.0,1/21/2014,"Giant restaurant chains like Applebee's, O'Charley's, Chili's, etc are pretty linear when it comes to food and service. This place gets a solid a-okay. I met an old friend from high school here last night around 7pm. First off, I almost missed my turn because I didn't see the Applebee's sign soon enough and two, the actual sign on the building wasn't on, so I just saw a dark exterior. Not a deal breaker if you can navigate the crazy traffic on Pleasant Hill. Our server was very friendly and we chatted him for a minute. Unfortunately he couldn't super-size my sangria, but he was kind enough to fill it to the brim. Bless him. My friend and I were so busy catching up that we kept forgetting to look at the menu, but our server never rushed us.  We ordered the chips and salsa ($2.99) to nibble on while we chatted. I haven't been to Applebee's in years, so I don't remember their tortilla chips very well, but these chips were pretty greasy. A napkin was required for these chips. Nonetheless, they were crispy and handled the salsa nicely. Functionality ftw! I ordered the grilled shrimp and spinach salad because I'm trying to be healthy and all that jazz. I honestly wasn't too keen on eating salad when I saw they had a special on burgers and drafts that night, but willpower! I'm glad I stuck with my decision because the salad was very good! Fresh baby spinach leaves and perfectly grilled shrimp came together like white on rice. Like Justin Timberlake and Jimmy Fallon rap battles. Like Tina Fey and Amy Poehler hosting the Golden Globes. Like Chewy and Han in Star Wars. I somehow found the strength to save some for leftovers. I forgot what my friend ordered, but she picked at it all night. This place hasn't changed in years. The same booths, the same dim lighting, the same TVs and the pretty much the same food. This place has everything - steaks, burgers, salad, sandwiches, wraps, seafood, chicken dishes and pasta. They don't really have a ""signature"" item they're known for, so most of the food is mediocre and decent at best. Don't expect the food to knock your socks off.

Drinks take 15 minutes, but it's a Saturday night so that's understandable. Appetizers not so much. Took 40 mins. I actually order a entree after 20min after my app. They came at the same time. While all this is happening I haven't heard anything from the server not a apology or anything. No manager came to they table. I was left in the dark the whole time. When the app. did come out it was cold as if it was sitting there the whole time.  My burger thank god was cooked perfectly and was hot. That sums up all the bad. On a good not the sever next to ours was attentive with all his tables while running around to help us. His name was Nick thank you so much for you help. Also the host helped as well he talked to the manager early in our visit to help everything along the way, yet the manger never came. He actually spoke to the table next to us about there drink.

Duc L.,"Atlanta, GA",191,190,26,1.0,5/22/2012,"I hate to give establishments anything under 3 stars because I feel that if they try, then it should be so-so at best, but this place is just horrible.  I know better to stay away from Applebee's since my last visit which was over 2 years ago and never thought to come back but was over-ruled in a group of friends recently to dine here for a late dinner. The guys were really adamant on going here for half-off appetizers after 10pm.  We had a table of 7 which wait time was about what you would expect for a party that large. When we were sat, the waiter constantly forgot our drinks and failed to acknowledge a new member to the group who arrived a little late. We asked him for a drink twice for the new member, still no show after two attempts. Food arrived promptly after ordering which was one of the few positives I can say. When it came down to checks, we physically had to get our waiter to get our checks since he was in the corner talking to another coworker for about 15 minutes thinking he would notice all of us looking at him. The debacle with the credit cards, not getting it right, not printing out the signature slips with him was just a joke. We had to have a manager override his mistake to give us our signature slip for some reason.  Of course the guys who suggested to go here ordered appetizers all around which I've learned to stay clear from. So I ordered  the cowboy burger, some pink. Burger came a little too close being done than my liking. But the thing that bothered me was that it wasn't hot. It came out just a tad warmer than warm.  My friends ordered everything from nachos to the ultimate trio and some had hot wings also. So with everyone's orders, anything that involved melted cheese (mozzarella sticks, nacho cheese, spinach dip, etc) became hard within about 5 minutes. Mozzarella sticks are good, but when it re hardens before you have a chance to eat it, it becomes gross. I don't know if it's just the quality of the cheese or what, but I wouldn't eat that. The wings were skinny and I think the only appetizer that wasn't critiqued to the floor was the nachos.  I told myself I would not visit this restaurant, so never again. If you're in this area, just go to chili' or steak and shake across the street. It'll save you some disappointment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-duluth-6?start=40

Went here Thursday night. This is not a place to watch football, since the TV's are so small and feel outdated. I asked for a manhattan from the table i was sitting at and saw the bartender pour crown royal and ice into a shaker, strain it and serve it in a large shot glass. Really?? no sweet vermouth or bitters or a cherry?? I wonder who the hell is hiring these bartenders...atleast serve it in the correct glassware you schmucks... i ordered some chili and chips and salsa...which weren't bad...but this experience reminded me why i don't go to Applebee's anymore.

Manager: ""If we honored it for you, then we'd have to honor it for everyone."" W O W . . . . . does service get worse than this? Actually, it does. And you can experience it here at Applebee's On top of this horrible awakening of restaurant service here at Applebee's  along with a 30 minute wait to get seated and another 30 minute wait to order our food, we finally got to place orders. SERVICE: 0 stars. Wait... Yelp only allows you to give 1-5 stars. Yeah, I'm giving it 0 stars. The wait time to get seated, the wait time to order, and not bringing out a salad along with taking another 20 minutes to take our method of payment after you bring us the checks. Awful. Oh, not to mention not honoring the Happy Hour Half Off deal. FOOD: 1 star. I ordered a 7 ounce sirloin steak medium rare, and it came out medium well. By the time I got my food, I was hungry enough that plastic probably would have tasted just as good. The onion rings had way too much breading (probably 60% of it was breading) and the broccoli and mashed potatoes were pretty normal. AMBIANCE: It's a small restaurant that's packed in way too tight. There are very few aisles where you can have two people walk down it so it's just awkward when a waitress/waiter tries to get around you while you're trying to walk into or out of the restaurant.

She explain all my questions throughly and give me some great description of the dishes. This kind of service is usually rare at places like Applebee's, so this made me want to come back more in the future for sure! Since Applebee's been having their two for 20$ menu for the past couple of years, every time i stop by i usually order from this menu. Off this menu, I ordered the chicken freshcado and my friend orders the bourbon street chicken and shrimp. Out of the two dish, I enjoyed mine more. It tastes more healthy and fresh. the Bourbon street chicken was more on the salty side. But the chicken in both entree was cooked perfectly so that was good.

ChrisAnne S.,"South Elgin, IL",10,40,26,1.0,2/18/2015,"I could NOT wait to get home to write this review, so I will cut right to the chase. I had not been to this location in a few years because of the less than stellar service, but I was excited about their new Pub Menu so we thought we would give it a try. Big mistake.  DO NOT GO HERE! I literally just left the restaurant and this is what we experienced. Keep in mind, the store was NOT busy, even at lunch time so that should tell you something.  1. We did get seated immediately, but it took the server about 10 minutes to get to us. Once she took our drink order and left, (and about 5 minutes later) another waitress comes over and asks to take our order. We indicated our waitress had already been there, and we were still waiting. She seemed confused because it was supposed to be her table. Once we finally got our water about 5 more minutes after that, we ordered. I ordered the new brisket nachos and French Onion Soup and she got the Cajun Shrimp and Chicken. I asked that the waitress bring the soup and nachos out as my entrée. I really will not quibble about the food coming out together because there were more serious issues at hand. The soup was really the only decent thing - it wasn't piping hot, but it had a good flavor - lots of cheese and a generous portion of croutons.  The brisket nachos looked REALLY good and I decided to order them for a change. ( I usually get the fiesta lime chicken)  The meat was DISGUSTING. I absolutely love beef brisket, but this was shredded beef that looked like it was boiled in water then slopped in liquid cheese.  The texture was mushy, not fork tender like you would expect. It was horrible. It did not taste like brisket either- I can't even describe it. The chips and standard toppings on it were fine, so there is 1 star.  About 10 minutes after I got served, they brought my daughter's entrée out. They served it on one of those fajita plates and was extremely hot, the plate that is. The grilled veggies (onions and mushrooms, and I believe peppers)  were charred, nearly burnt. The aroma was not pleasant. My daughter and I each took a piece of shrimp off the chicken and ate - OMG. It was mushy and nearly raw. We both nearly gagged. Within minutes we were both queasy.  Not one time did our waitress come check on us. We had to ask the hostess to please get the manager. When he came over and we explained our dissatisfaction with the meal, he said we were wrong because he checked the temperature, and then proceeded to pull a blue thermometer out of his pocket and said, ""see? I checked the temperature it was ok and fully cooked."" I looked at him like he was out of his mind. I also let him know about how the nachos weren't good at all.  This is what pissed me off the most. The fact that he would want to argue, and it was an argument, about how we felt our experience and food was and basically just minimize our complaints was beyond me. He said he would take the chicken/shrimp off (chicken was not even touched) but we were made to pay for the nachos. I wish I would have taken a picture so you can see that the nachos were barely touched.  My daughter and I did indicate that we were a bit queasy, but he kept on saying it wasn't his product. It was.  He brought us the check and waited for me to give him payment. I paid- but only making sure I had a survey on my receipt because I am getting with Corporate on this one. He has no business being a manager.  On a side note, two business men came in about 5 minutes after we did and were in seated in the next booth. They waited a hellava lot longer than we did to even get a waitress to order a glass of water. When she finally showed up the guy came right out and said - FINALLY, it took you long enough, we have been here a long time, so we are already starting out badly. She giggled as she said, ""oh sorry"". So to recap, service was slow, food was disgusting, and the manager should not be one.  As we left the building and walked on to the parking lot, my daughter says ""Mom, I don't feel...."" and then proceeded to throw up everywhere. I hope they were quick to clean that up, because no one would walk into that restaurant ever again if they saw that.

Over salted brown meat disc with rubber shrimp and raw broccoli. Fail.  I will say this...after not eaten in 9 hours I was starving enough to stomach about a third of the dish.  The side salad was not fresh, some leaves were brown and slimy.  The only redeeming portion of this meal was the blondie skillet with maple butter sauce. I did not eat much of the maple butter, or too much blondie since I figured my cholesterol would go through the roof. A quick Google search proved me correct. 50+ grams of fat.

mark c.,"San Antonio, TX",4,19,,1.0,3/27/2011,"Dropped in for a late lunch on a Wed afternoon.  I'm glad this was paid for via gift card (the only reason I went).  The so-called Reuben sandwich I ordered had no saurerkraut and no dressing.  It was just dry, salty, and overpriced. The service was inattentive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-duluth-6?start=60
Lauren T.,"Norcross, GA",1,5,,1.0,6/28/2013,"Well I went here last Friday for a quick and easy lunch with my husband and 2 kids. Well let me start off by saying this, I am a server and have been in the food industry for 8 years... with that being said this place was atrocious. First off our server Brittany was more worried about her cell phone and playing in the kitchen than to take the proper steps of service and make sure we were okay. I ordered my kids food with the app so that they didn't sit hungry. And what happened they sat, and sat, and sat. HORRIBLE! Once our app hit the table we were starving, but of course what did we find? a piece of fuzz in our food! We get Brittany's attention to tell her and she goes back to the kitchen and comes back and says that the kitchen staff said it was from the cleaning rags in the back! ARE U SERIOUS? so not only did you guys have a rag near my food but one you use to clean with that probably had product on it! Ehh! so of course our food comes out and about 10 mins after that the app hits the table. No management visit, no apologies, no nothing! then on top of that I have to flag the waitress down to get our check and they still had the app on the bill! Are you serious? This place SUCKS! I cannot believe that a corporate restaurant would have such low server standards as well as customer service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-duluth-6?start=60
Yasiin H.,"Norcross, GA",0,21,3,3.0,2/8/2014,I recently went to this place its a pretty solid  experience.The food was good and the service was good.The one thing that didn't amuse me was that the menu didn't have much variety and the two for twenty deals don't amaze me.It is also very loud and not really spacious,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-duluth-6?start=60

Andrew A.,"Duluth, GA",0,19,,1.0,5/14/2014,"We went to this restaurant for dinner on a weekday.  The place is more bar than restaurant  and not family friendly.  A bartender (white female) on her break was sitting at a table off to one side of the building having a loud conversation with a black male employee about giving it to him the ""white girl way"".  My daughter heard this and said ""she's being inappropriate"".  And she was, loudly.  The waitress brought us drinks, held against her body, in one arm.  A roll of fat was over the lip of our cups.  Some of our drinks spilled on her sweaty tank top and she didn't notice or she didn't care.  Just plain nasty.  It took two trips to get straws, and even then we couldn't drink them.  The food was terrible, and took forever to get it.  I ordered a steak that came with mashed potatoes and broccoli.  The steak was barely warm, the potatoes were cold and only the broccoli was warm, not hot.  My daughter got the kid's french bread pizza and she loves pizza.  She would not eat it.  The bread was barely toasted, and the cheese was nasty.  As we were trying to eat, the hostess starts moving tables next to ours and seats two parties of rowdy people that were there to party.  Not an environment for a family, and the hostess was clueless.  We couldn't get out of the fast enough.  As we tried to leave a woman was blocking one of the doors, standing with her arms on the door looking out.  The other door was blocked by some clueless patron making a phone call.  Once we got through that obstacle we figured out why the one woman was blocking the door.  There was a guy pressure washing the sidewalk at the entrance of the building.  Who does that kind of work during the dinner hour?  This is just a low class, poorly run restaurant.  A classic example of why businesses in the Gwinnett Place area are dying off.  There are no restaurants in that area that are worth going to anymore.  It gets one star because zero is not an option.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-duluth-6?start=60
