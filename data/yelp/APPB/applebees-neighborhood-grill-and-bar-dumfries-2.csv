Marija P.,"Washington, DC",2,1,,2.0,11/21/2017,Came on a wednesday. Not busy. Waitress was very kind. Ordered barbeque brisket taco.....wheres the brisket? I best describe it as slop on a tortilla. Won't be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dumfries-2
Ron L.,"Woodbridge, VA",22,49,,1.0,9/18/2017,"I see my last visit there was Jan.12, 2016 and vowed never to return...Well sinceI was in the company of 3 others and the couple with us was celebrating their 62nd anniversary, I went along silently... My previous review  just about sums up this latest visit except our wait for EVERYTHING was longer. First after being seated, most hosts ASK if you would like something to drink!!! Not this one, who scooted off to who knows where for 10 minutes before returning...I might note there was only 2 other tables occupied at approx. 1:45pm...we saw only 3 employees the whole time and one disappeared early on...When the hostess returned I quickly requested water and coffee and the standard reply was a NEW pot was being brewed...another 10min wait... With no new customers entering I continue to wonder what the employees are doing if not serving us...When our orders arrived, the food was good, but when you have to wait waaaaaay to long for it when the restaurant is practically empty, there is a serious problem somewhere...and in the back of my mind I believe it was empty  because of the SLOW service. How this location has managed to survive baffles me since speed in turning tables and selling alcohol is their lifeblood. If a restaurant ever needed a firm hand to guide it, this is the one... I must note I have frequented the Applebees on PW Pkwy at Minnieville Rd and continue to b e pleased with their operation and food.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dumfries-2
Juan D.,"Historic Core, Los Angeles, CA",218,1,,1.0,1/1/2018,"Eating here is worse than traffic on 95. Waiters are really good at hide-and-seek. Better off driving an hour more to Fredericksburg for food. It'll be quicker than waiting for your drinks. Games were mediocre at best. If you prefer olive oil, ""butter"" not go here.

Raymond W.,"Woodbridge, VA",8,163,162,3.0,6/9/2017,"I come here every once in a while.  Nice atmosphere, friendly waitstaff, and the food is good enough.  It's a chain so don't look for exquisite cuisine.  Stick to burgers and appetizers and you're good.  I tried the steak wonton tacos and they're actually pretty good.  Crisp wonton taco shell with carne asada beef and some really good slaw.  4 to an order is more than enough.  I'll be back eventually.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dumfries-2
Andrew P.,"Woodbridge, VA",51,250,60,1.0,2/5/2017,"Absolutely the worse Applebee's experience I've had. I literally sat across from the bar tender's register and she never checked up on me. I was desperately wanting to order food but was so frustrated I left my 90% filled beer and closed my tab.  I was sitting on the peripheral of the bar area and no one came and that's why I sat at the bar. While I was sitting at the bar, another couple sat at the outer tables and received prompt service, attention, and food order.   I invite this location's manager to reach out and discuss this situation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dumfries-2
Valerie W.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,2,,1.0,12/20/2017,"Absolutely worst experience ever. Went for dinner with my fiance and 1 year old. Seated promptly, but I had to get up and get my kids menu myself. It took about ten minutes to get drink orders and the waitress was out of it, kept asking me what I wanted I don't know how many times I have to say lemonade? Placed our appetizers (spinach dip and Wonton tacos) with our daughters mac and cheese. These came out 20 mins later and the wontons were missing one. mac and cheese another ten minutes later. Had to ask twice for silverware and napkins. The waitress took our orders another 20 minutes after the appetizers came, meanwhile as we were eating our dip a different server comes up as I'm eating it lifts it off the table and asks if we're done. Sure take what you just saw me eating? then waitress came and said they didn't have eggs to make my fiances burger.. Fine so he asked for a regular cheese burger. Food came out and the waitress just dropped it off didn't ask if we needed anything (which we did). We needed refills and his burger was wrong. It was just cheese burger and bun. Nothing else. The bill came 20 mins after asking for it. Was charged for the wrong burger, she went to fix it and I asked for a manager.  This is the best part. Manager walks up doesn't introduce herself acts annoyed (very unprofessional) says ""what's wrong I'm the manager"" I start off telling her how his burger was wrong and she wanted to cut me off and argue I said I'm not paying 12$ for a plain burger. She says ""okay"" after arguing with me about what's on a burger. Cool but nothing was on his burger! Didnt even get to mention the terrible service before she walked away. The server promptly brought us our new check that had $2 taken off for the burger. What a joke and slap to my face.  I paid the $45 bill and left no tip. (Which I never do because I have worked in the food service industry a long time.) My assumption they will discount that Bill more to get her a tip after we left.  Rude. Slow. Unprofessional. Not to mention it was not busy. You see a family with a kid I would think you'd be more courteous and a bit faster. Won't be back. And I am emailing corporate about this manager and experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dumfries-2
DeeDee M.,"Woodbridge, VA",65,16,,1.0,10/7/2017,"Won't be going back here! Everyone knows of course Applebee's are having their $1 margaritas. Long story short after my friend had a second drink, he found a hair in his damn drink!!! Told the bar tender and she says, ""well it must have came from the dishwasher because I'm wearing a weave and I know it's not mine!"" Mind you she's wearing long black curly hair... that looked just like the piece of hair that was found in his drink!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dumfries-2
Ivory D.,"Woodbridge, VA",50,64,30,1.0,2/12/2017,"I was really disappointed with my experience here. The bartender, Hasani ( who wanted to make sure I spell his name the correct way) was exceptionally rude to my friend and I. Upon entering the restaurant went straight to the bar and before we were able to sit down completely Hasani, asked us for our id's ""can I see your ID, i want to make sure you all are old enough before you get comfortable"" While I understand making sure your bar patrons are old enough to have an adult beverage is the law, Hasani's demeanor was less than pleasant. If he paid half as much attention to the bar it would have would have made sure the bar, plates, and silverware were cleaned before ""we got comfortable"" as well. I tried to engage in regular bar conversation but he was extremely short. Hasani could invest in improving his people skills just a tad more. I had more conversation with another bar patron than I did my own bartender. Aside from Hasani's attitude he did make a delicious mango perfect patron margarita! For my meal I had the Spicy Verde Nachos which were great as well but I would ask for an extra side of meat as well as cooking my jalapeños. After Hasani overheard me expressing my feelings about my visit he insisted that I speak to the manager. The manager, Frank, did make his way over about ten minutes later. Frank did offer to pick up the tab h/e I expressed that my food and drink was good it was the rude attitude of the bartender that left my friend and I very disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dumfries-2
J L.,"Dumfries, VA",1,153,83,1.0,8/18/2016,"We tried again due to receiving what we thought was a good deal in the post.  Disappointment BIG TIME! We showed up at 11:27am.  NO BARTENDER!!  None of the taps were ready, nothing.  A young man at the door ran in the back and a guy in a red chef coat came out and started to serve us.  The bartender then came out and finished our pour, but after wiping his face on his hands.  The store manager didn't even show up until NOON.  Haywood introduced himself, gave us our beer and menus; then went into back again.  A man sat down close to us.  Haywood came out and spent the next 20 MINUTES talking to HIM!  Never once checked on us.  The picture I posted showed his position with his back to US (yes I know I take crappy photos, sorry). Haywood and this guy spoke about him going to UCLA or Chicago University taking a degree in psychology and how to pay for it.  Ya know, I'm glad he wants to better himself, but this is a conversation you have on YOUR time OUTSIDE of work!  Not DURING you shift while people are waiting to order. I FINALLY had to ask if he ""can you take our order now?""  Placed our order 2 apps, shrimp & avocado salad and 8oz sirloin medium-rare w/4cheese & mac and broccoli.  Hubby was getting ticked off at this point about the lack of interest from Haywood. We didn't get any napkins or our dinnerware UNTIL food came out.  When it came out I had my salad to go because he was starving and waited all morning for lunch at Applebees. He almost walked out because 1) if that was 8 oz then I'm a natural blonde and 2) the steak came out WELL DONE, but we couldn't find Haywood to return it.  He was getting lightheaded because he hadn't eaten since 2am (works graveyard).  His mac & cheese were not cooked thoroughly and this picture in the menu showed bacon on it but it came bland.  It  comes out of the BOX better than what was on the plate.  PLUS there was still melted plastic on his broccoli! Haywood then disappeared AGAIN and I had to almost YELL to get his attention to pay our bill.   COMPLETE and utter HORRIBLE lunch.  He didn't want to leave a tip, he just wanted to pay and walk out.  I tipped, but I'll be dammed if I EVER go back and I'll tell EVERYONE at MY BAR to avoid this location.   In the 4 years we've lived in Dumfries, this is the 4th or 5th time we've tried this location; even after the mass firing and ""re-training"" that was supposedly done at this location shows they truly need retraining!   Haywood, there are OTHERS at the bar and a bartender needs to check on them several times NOT when the food comes out and when we have to ASK to ORDER AND PAY!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dumfries-2
Scott H.,"Woodbridge, VA",10,11,3,2.0,3/5/2017,My fiancé and I stopped by on Saturday for a quick dinner... The service was fine but I had a couple other issues... first they have these electronic devices on the table and we played trivia to kill the time and was charged... Went back and saw the vet small print regarding charges... I am sure they get many complaints on this... I did not as I chalked it up to my lack of attention. My fiancé ordered a salad that she stated was very tasty! I ordered the Bourbon Chicken n Shrimp... The chicken and shrimp was good but the potatoes and onions were burnt from sitting in the skillet way too long...

The Foodie ..,"Washington, DC",0,76,26,1.0,4/11/2017,"Horrible service. Party came in close to 10pm and had to wait a super long time for food. By the time all the food came out, majority of us had already eaten and was ready to go. Finally, some of the food that was ordered earlier came out. But the waiter asked if they wanted it to go. It seemed that we were being pushed to take things to go Friends had to keep asking for refills, that basically came after two or three times of asking. Some of the food came out undercooked. Bathrooms were disgusting.  People were at the bar super loud and yelling profanities. We probably would've been better going to IHOP. This Applebee's needs serious attention. We should've been guided by the ratings before going there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dumfries-2

Review G.,"Washington, DC",2,105,38,1.0,7/18/2016,We ordered 2 steak salads and 2 beers. Check came out to $45 with tip. Place was cold. We waited 25 min for the salad and it's something a 3 year old could of made in 5 minutes. They also gave only 4 to 5 pieces of meat that looked like it was already chewed by a rat!

Bil G.,"Dale City, VA",5,325,,1.0,12/4/2016,"Extremely slow in everything.  Took forever for them to make my cherry limeade.  Very tough steak with a lot of gristle.  They screwed up my soup, French onion, and had to remake it and it took forever.  I told the waiter I wanted the soup ahead of the steak and of course he brought both at the same time.  But he said this happened because they had to remake the soup.  The waiter was nice though he was slow but maybe it was more the kitchen's fault than his fault.  Between the poor quality steak and the VERY slow everything I won't return to that Applebees.  Horrible experience.  Oh yes, all their sides were potatoes, baked potato, mashed potatoes, french fries and sweet potato.  The alternatives were beans and broccoli.  No coke to drink only Pepsi products which I detest.  Of course if you sell Pepsi then you are supporting Pepsi's Yum Foods Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dumfries-2

Christine M.,"Stafford, VA",0,14,,1.0,6/5/2017,I was so disappointed with this Applebee's. Our server was absolutely horrible. It took him forever to bring water and about 15 minutes for him to bring the drink from the bar. The drink was extremely watered down so he said he would bring another one. After 20 minutes I had to ask for the drink because it was so watered down and he never brought the replacement. He also messed up the order. He blamed it on his other tables ordering the same exact thing. By this point I was ready to go. I asked him for the check. 15 minutes later and asking him a few more times for the check he finally brought it and charged me for the drink he was supposed to replace! The restaurant was a mess too. There were chairs in the middle of the walkway so you couldn't get around. Plus the bathroom was a mess. I don't think I'll be back to this one.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dumfries-2
Hedda C.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,40,47,1.0,10/23/2016,"Lesson learned ,  Never again to leave  any restaurants or any place without the  receipt especially if you pay cash like what I did . I went to Applebee's restaurant  , Dumfries , Va.,  last night friday night and ordered their Sir loin  with 2 sides , one french fries and the other potatoe with cheddar cheese  and bacon for take out . Again the meat was  real hard and still red in the insides.   The 2 sides were placed in one container . Unfortunately, I was not able to take picture of the food. Called in and spoke to the manager and complained . I mentioned to her that I paid cash.  And no receipt was given to me . Manager told me they do not make a refund for cash.

Lumi N.,"Lorton, VA",4,6,,1.0,7/21/2015,"Horrible and will never go there again.  Every time I have visited the location there is very poor customer service.  There is usually no one at the front to seat you, once you do get seated, sometimes it takes 10-20 mins to get any attention from the waitress.  Even if you get their attention, it can take just as long for them to get your drinks out, including if you asked for a mere glass of water. Today I placed an online order around 2pm to avoid the terrible on site experience.  My husband went to pick up the order at 2:30pm and they said the order was non existent.  My husband called me to tell me this and I told him that I would forward him the confirmation email for the order.  He approached them again with this information and this time they said that they no longer served one of the sandwiches that I had ordered.  Okay, if that was the case then how come I never got a phone call or email requesting for me to update my order before they could proceed?  I was lucky that I did not pay for the order online.  I told my husband to cancel it and that we would get food from elsewhere.   I just tried to submit my complaint on their website but the site gave me an error.  Fix your damn website and update the content.  If you're no longer serving certain items, then you need to remove them.  If you don't update your site, then you better make sure that your employees are able to follow up with customers about it.  If you won't allow customers to submit complaints directly, then take out that feature and  put a disclosure that blatantly says ""We don't care about you, we just want your money despite our bad service.""

Hannah C.,"Brooklyn, NY",11,7,20,2.0,1/20/2015,"I came here on a Sunday night with a few friends while visiting the area. Two of my friends are from the area so they are used to the service here, and as most of us might realize at some point or another, Applebee's is nothing too grand or special. The drinks were good and are not overpriced. We got drink specials because of the NFL playoff game that was on and got half-priced appetizers as well. The only bummer to the night was the service. The bartender was pretty slow and didn't seem too bothered to speed up the service. We weren't approached by a server until about ten minutes after sitting, and were then told that he didn't know who our server was but he would take us. Not the greatest customer service, but I was looking for anything too special that night anyways.

Eddie C.,"Stafford, VA",0,1,,5.0,8/9/2015,"I've made two visits to the Apple Bees in the Stafford Va area, each of those visits I left unsatisfied,  mainly due to poor communication among the staff. The corrections to our meal and bill were made, but with a party of five everyone enjoyed there meal separately instead of together. Now the customer service at the Dumfries location, no complaints what so ever. We were able to sit where we wanted, the appetizers came out fresh and hot, the sodas we ordered weren't flat,  I really appreciated that the manager delivered the food to our table, and before leaving our table he made sure the steak was to our satisfaction. We arrived closer to the closing hour, with my mind already  in set for a rotten meal.  We ordered the steak, and completely forgot to mention no mushrooms when we placed the order, when the server came back around ( 5-10 minute time frame ) we asked for the correction to be made, there were no eyeball rolls or hot steam from under the breath, a polite No problem was given.

Mare K.,"Vienna, VA",0,3,,1.0,3/28/2016,"Three strikes you're out. We heard there were new menu items and different promotions going on everyday of the week and we figure we see what it was all about. Well they say curiosity killed the cat and we'll this was the last straw and it totally killed my vibe of Applebee's. Again our server was great, food was ok. Loved the new double crunch wings, however my steak was over cooked and the parmesean made it very greasy. But that wasn't even the issue. There was a promotion going on, which was $2 domestic pints and more after 4 pm. So instead of a Bahama mama  I got a pint. When the bill came out they were regular priced, notified the server he apologized and said he would talk to the manager. Our server came back and said that because they were ordered before 9 it was not part of the promo.  Although it said nothing of the sort on the flyer. ""I said that makes no sense and that we didn't get our drinks till after 9"" if they wanted to be sticklers. He came back after asking the manager again in our view and he seemed so beat about what he was gonna come back to tell us. He then said he misunderstood what the manager said and that since it was after 9 pm it was not part of the promo. I said "" well technically we ordered our beers around 8:40 ish, but didn't get them till after 9pm"" he said oh. I said ""nevermind I'll just pay the bill"",  by this time I was done and ready to leave. The manager then decided to come up to the table and explain the promo and how in Maryland that promo can go till close but in Virginia it stops at 9 pm. I said ""it still makes no sense and if you want to be technical, our beers were ordered before 9pm. Also from my experience in restaurant management for 5 years, you are to honor the promo if the lack of info is wrong on the restaurant's side."" But whatever I'm just the customer right. Good thing I wasn't a secret shopper that evening or when they had a live DJ who was playing music with cuss words as my family and I ate dinner around 8 pm.

Vianca S.,"Springfield, VA",0,1,,1.0,9/30/2014,If I could give this place negative stars I would. I made a yelp account solely to write a review to warn you guys to NEVER COME HERE. I am not being overdramatic. Ive given this place multiple chances but the service is constantly wretched. Every time I've been here it has taken AT LEAST 10 mins to get my drinks. I can see the bartender hanging out with some of her friends instead of making my drinks. It's just awful. AWFUL!!!

Gretchen J.,"Woodbridge, VA",6,21,4,1.0,5/10/2015,"Applebee's is not known as a great restaurant, but this one was especially bad. I needed a high chair, which the host knew, but i stood, at the table, waiting holding my hungry one year old for 10 minutes before someone came, and then I had to specify why I was still standing. We stopped to grab a ""quick"" bite because we had 4 hungry kids. I usually wipe the table with disposable wipes because my baby eats off the table- the table was so disturbingly dirty - Absolutely filthy- If the traffic hadn't been so bad, we would have walked out. The floor is so greasy it's slippery.  This place needs to be shut down. We actually had a great waiter- Travis, I think. He needed better training (like don't put anything in front of a baby, especially not drinks), but was a great guy. This place is WAY beneath him. Food was marginal at best. I couldn't eat my dinner bc it was so greasy, but the kids stuff was normal Applebee's quality. We waited 10 min for high chair, 20 min for dinner and 20 minutes for a check. OMG. Never again.

Guy B.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,26,,1.0,2/24/2015,"This is our third and last time at this restaurant. In all fairness our first two visits were actually pretty good.  We were seated quickly  and within two minutes our waitress came to the table.  We ordered drinks and an appetizer.  Drinks came pretty fast the appetizer arrived a little later.  20 minutes later the waitress reappeared and asked if we were ready to order dinner. We were ready for some  refills on the drinks that's for sure.  We ordered two steak dinners and a burger. We asked for the steaks to be rare and medium rare respectively.  Twenty minutes later the steaks came out. One was on a sizzling platter really hot well done. The other on a warm platter cold on top. When the food was delivered our drink glasses were empty. No offer of a refill, waitress gone. She came back about ten minutes later to check if the meal was ok, and we asked for refills. She brought us the drinks and about 15 minutes later came back to check on us. We order a couple of the small sundaes. By then I actually put the stop watch on her and it took 13 minutes and 45 seconds to bring the dessert. If the place had been packed that would have been one thing. If the food was slowed down by the kitchen that would have been understandable, but when my sundae was delivered the ice cream was already completely melted! It had been sitting waiting for pickup long enough to melt.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dumfries-2?start=40

Eric B.,"Norfolk, VA",24,7,,1.0,4/25/2017,"My expectations for Applebees generally aren't super high: I expect decent food and service. In particular, when traveling for work I will often take advantage of the outside pick up option so that I can pick up food on the way back to my hotel as I can't go inside in uniform. I ordered food online to be delivered via Car side To Go on April 25th, to be ready at 6:15. I arrived at 6:10, and continued some work related phone calls while waiting for my food. At 6:33, I called and was told that the 'to go' server wasn't working, but the gentleman who answered the phone had noticed me waiting outside. He said he would grab my food and bring it out. At 6:54, I called again and this time spoke to someone who very helpfully brought the food out. From the temperature, it was clear it had been waiting since 6:15. Travis, who brought my food out, was very apologetic and offered to have it remade, but after waiting for 40 minutes I decided to just take it. No discount was offered. I will not be returning. Ironically, I was contemplating just leaving, but felt guilty about them making food that I was going to leave behind. Clearly they didn't have a similar concern about me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dumfries-2?start=20

Joyce P.,"Dumfries, VA",6,3,1,1.0,7/15/2016,"I haven't been at an Applebee's in years and last night's experience reminds me why. When we got into the restaurant it was slow especially for a Thursday night. First, the host took their time to get to us. The server got to our table in a reasonable time and got our drink order and got it to the table in a reasonable time. Once we gave our server our order it took a very long time to get it. It would be understandable if it was busy but they were pretty slow. I'm not going to blame the server completely for that because that's the kitchen staff but she never came to our table for a very long period of time. We got our food and it was okay but we kinda expected that and the really the only reason why we went there was because I had a gift card that I've had for a while. When we finally got our check I give them my gift card along with the credit card. They couldn't get the gift card to work for a long time. They came back to the table and said they can't use the gift card after messing with it for over 15 minutes. I called the phone number on the gift card to check the balance which took 2 minutes and got the balance on the card. I told the server that there is a balance on the card why can't they just call the number and deduct the amount that's on the card. Finally the manager comes to our table and tells us that I would have to call the corporate office and get a new card issued to me...really! We are thinking we don't want to come back here to just to use the gift card again. I have never received such horrible customer service. My son is a server and had comp customers before with no issues but they didn't even offer that or anything. We were very disappointed with the customer service at this Applebee's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dumfries-2?start=20
Christopher C.,"Woodbridge, VA",11,18,3,1.0,12/24/2015,"When we sat down to a sticky table for lunch today I suddenly remembered why I stayed away from Applebee's in the first place. After 15+ minutes to get our drinks we ordered our food, fried chicken tenders so over cooked they could be used as weapons, onion rings in much the same fashion. Their blackberry lemonade consists of a glass of Country Time pink lemonade with a shot of black/blue syrup lurking at the bottom. Kids pizza was a sandwich half slathered in Prego like sauce and something that closely resembled cheese. 50 bucks later I'm feeling robbed at overpriced food, filthy restaurant and  food.

Jorge P.,"Dumfries, VA",1,19,13,1.0,9/21/2015,"I have been to plenty of Applebees in many states and this is by far one of the slowest and worst customer service location's I have ever seen at any restaurants. My family came before the normal dinner rush 530 to be exact to where the staff out numbers the customers, and still it is very slow. We have put our drink orders with two different staff members to still be asked by a third what we would like to drink. Ultimately the manger is responsible and you can only blame the managers I have no clue how a manager will and can allow such slow service when it is this slow.

We had to ask another waiter to find our waiter to find out what happened! After about 1/2 hour, the appetizers came out. They were not bad. Then, the entrees came in a timely fashion. We asked for more water, and eventually the waiter brought refills. When one of our guests went to take a second sip from her glass of water, she noticed what she thought was a lemon seed in the glass. Upon closer inspection, she discovered it was a cockroach!
