Mary-Michael M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",153,103,79,5.0,10/19/2017,"Ok so this Applebee's not fine dining. You do know what you are getting when you pull into the lot. And what I expected when I showed up while traveling with three kids is exactly what we got.  I wasn't expecting fine dining. I wasn't expecting amazing complex meals or gourmet recipes. I basically wanted a step above fast food while we took a break on our trip. And that's exactly what we got. I couldn't be happier. Nice service. Happy kids. The kids fit right into the restaurant and nobody was bothered. Our food was exactly what was described on the menu. Simple, American style meals.   Again, let's be real this is Applebee's.  It was exactly what the kids needed and wanted. A place to relax happily  and munch on ridiculous amounts of ranch dressing soaked French fries and chicken fingers. While sucking down drinking that are perfectly covered in cups that are made spill proof with lids & straws and crayons have been provided for their entertainment.  Hey Applebees may have some people turn their nose up at for not being the trendiest place but my kiddos were left feeling happy and satisfied. Our server was a delight. Their meals were prompt. Their dipping sauces flowed freely! And that's what's important.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ebensburg-2
Matthew U.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2086,1446,649,3.0,8/15/2017,"After reading the other reviews I kind of want to smack some of the people that reviewed this place.  It's kind of sad that people aren't allowed to post a review about their experience without someone else coming along and trying to negate what that person said.  To give this place a five star review solely because it had such negative reviews is not a review.  You came in here either because you are an employee trying to tip the scales in your favor or you never visited the place to write an educated review.  Now, since I got that out of the way I'm going to step down off my soapbox and give you my review for my experience here. First and foremost I am going to tell you I am not a fan of Applebee's, I may have been in the past, but as I matured I found that I favor more locally owned restaurants, whether they be ""pizza pub fare"" (whatever that means) or not.  I'm not a fan of chains, and guess what, I'm allowed to have that opinion.  The only reason I came here is because my family decided we would all go out to eat.   I agree with a lot of what others were saying, the food here is sub-par.  You can tell that it's put together rather fast and without much care.  Let me tell you about my meal.  I should have stuck with what I always get when I visit a chain restaurant, chicken fingers, you can rarely mess that up, unless you are Chili's.  But after looking over the menu I decided that I would try the Four-Cheese Mac + Cheese with Honey Pepper Chicken Tenders.  Not too far off of what I usually get and when you pair it with mac n cheese it kind of sounds amazing.  This dish, when looking at the accompanying picture, sounds amazing.  Creamy looking mac n cheese, crispy pieces of bacon and chicken tenders that are a bit saucy.  However what I got was misrepresented.  The base of this dish is the mac n cheese, made with four cheeses, but where was the cheesy flavor?  The bacon, more rubbery than crisp.  And the chicken tenders had just a touch of sauce.  I'm not quite sure how they are to have coated these chicken tenders with the sauce, but they did a horrible job at it.  In my head I thought that maybe these chicken tenders would have been tossed in a bowl with the sauce all around it and then added to the mac n cheese.  What I got was the chicken tenders placed on top of the mac n cheese and then the sauce kind of dumped on the plate, missing just about every inch of chicken.  Normally I wouldn't complain, big whoop, but this sauce, in large amounts, overpowered everything else on the plate.  It drenched the pasta, hid the cheesy flavor and might have been the culprit as to the rubbery bacon.  Thank god I enjoyed the salad I had beforehand or I would have left there less full than I had thought. As for the service, I'm not sure if we confused our server because we had a big party, but she didn't seem enthused.  She told us that it would be easier for her to split out checks instead of us being able to use the table top touch screens.  Whatever.  At the end of this visit, I was reaffirmed as to why I favor local restaurants more so than chains.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ebensburg-2
Lauren U.,"Northern Cambria, PA",44,17,14,4.0,3/23/2017,"Always a very nice place to eat for a local chain. Not too pricey, always so friendly.  The servers here are always super quick and kind.  The food is sort of ordinary, nothing unusual for an Applebee's.  Drinks are always cold and served correctly.  Overall, a nice place to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ebensburg-2
Nathan L.,"Munster Township, PA",2,7,,3.0,7/29/2017,"The service is typically great. The kitchen is fast to fulfill orders. However, this isn't the place to get a good steak. Several times I have gotten a fat-filled steak that was tough as leather when it was to be medium-rare. The strawberry lemonade was on fleek tho!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ebensburg-2
Kalyn B.,"Rossiter, PA",134,137,63,4.0,3/12/2016,"I would most definitely consider myself a regular at this particular Applebee's. At this point, I know most of the waitstaff and bartenders.  I've always had good service here. Sometimes I think the bartenders could use a few courtesy lessons, but over all, they're not too shabby.  When I come here, I know what to expect, and I know the quality of food I should receive. As far as food goes, this place has never let me down. I'm a fan of their late night half price appetizers. Nothing better than leaving with a full stomach and a low bill! :)  This Applebees does have trivia nights, but I'm not the biggest fan of their trivia emcee.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ebensburg-2
Shannon P.,"Nanty-Glo, PA",49,7,,2.0,4/7/2017,I like applebees but this one serves horrible food thats not even hot you can wait an hour for a table with no line and 6 empty visable tables. Service is horrible as well if you want applebees drive to Johnstown location its worth it,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ebensburg-2
Brian B.,"Zelienople, PA",0,9,2,2.0,11/23/2015,"I should have listened to the reviews on Yelp. I figured how bad can an Applebee's really be? This is a new restaurant, about a year old. While it is nice inside that is where the good ends. The service was very very slow. We waited a good 10 min for a waitress to take our drink order. We never saw her again until our food came out. I had the steak whisky grill with onions, peppers and mushrooms. The steak flavor was horrible and I could tell if it was seasoning or the butter they put on it. It was not tender and had gristle taste. The grilled vegetables came out like mush nothing grilled about them. My wife had a grilled chicken salad while it was not horrible she said it had little flavor. I tasted her chicken and she was right.  We were just passing through Ebensburg, I suggest you pass on by the Applebee's if you come through.  BTW they charge $1.99 to play trivia in the bar area. Really!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ebensburg-2
Ana C.,"Blairsville, PA",5,29,22,1.0,8/31/2015,"The service  was good but the food was sub-par, I came here with a friend and we  both noticed a rapid decline in the food since this Resturants grand opening. The staff are friendly and accommodating but it just doesn't make up for the poor quality of the food. Our pomegranate iced teas tasted like sugar water.   When our appetizers arrived they were over-cooked and gummy. The entrees were no better. My friend ordered the bourbon street steak, medium well. It was rare and the potatoes were underdone as well. I had the wedge salad and it was horrible! The lettuce was wilted and limp, it had almost no dressing, bacon or blue cheese. We paid $50 for a terrible meal. I was very disappointed because This Resturant had such a strong start and then declined so quickly. Please consider getting a new cook.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ebensburg-2

Leslie S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",142,218,228,3.0,12/26/2015,"I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants, but Applebee's is definitely one of the better ones. My dad and I were in Ebensburg visiting family and stopped for a late lunch. Their lunch specials are $6.99 - $8.99, depending on which items you choose. You can choose any two items from their Classic or Signature menu, and you can choose from small selection of salads, soups, sandwiches, and lunch-portioned entrees.  I had the Honey Pepper Chicken Tenders with Fries and the Fiesta Chicken Chopped Salad ($7.99). The portion was what I suspected for the price and the fact that it was a ""lunch special"". The fiesta chicken salad was all right, not a ton of flavor but definitely not bad. The chicken tenders were really good, great flavor and they gave you four medium sized tenders. My only real complaint is that it could have had more fries. My dad got the Honey Pepper Chicken Tenders with Fries and the Three-Cheese Chicken Penne ($6.99), and he said that he was happy with both.  Our waitress was extremely friendly and attentive. Also, the restaurant and bathrooms were clean for the most part. Only real complaint there is that it was after the lunch rush and the table behind my dad (that I was looking) sat un-bused for about 15 minutes after we sat down...not really appealing. It really wouldn't have been a big deal but, as I said, the place was not busy at all.  Overall, not a bad stop. More of a 3.5 stars. I would definitely give this Applebee's another try when in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ebensburg-2
S K.,"Ebensburg, PA",6,85,11,5.0,1/23/2017,"I had to rate 5 stars because I think the poor reviews of Applebee's are unfair.  It's an Applebee's just like every other Applebee's.  If you like this chain, you'll like this location.  To the poor reviews complaining about it being a chain restaurant.  In Ebensburg, if you want something other than fast food or pizza pub fare, you're options are severely limited.   Chain or not, I welcome any restaurant to the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ebensburg-2

J D.,"Greensburg, PA",0,1,,1.0,4/27/2016,"I stopped into the Applebee's in Ebensburg yesterday afternoon at around 4:45 PM and was not impressed.  My wife and I were two of three people sitting at the bar.  The rest of the bar area was empty and there were only a few other tables with guests so the restaurant was not busy.  The kitchen/wait staff was loud and we could be hear them joking around in the back from the bar area.  My wife and I tried to use the Wi-Fi and neither could connect.  We asked the bartender if it was down.  He said he would check with the manager but never did.  I later asked what he found out but he said he hadn't asked yet.  By then it was too late, the meal was over. I had the fish and chips entrée which comes with fries, tartar sauce, and coleslaw.  My wife got the cedar salmon with vegetables.  The food took a long time to come out even though they were not busy.  My food was marginally warm and my wife's vegetables were cold.  I think it sat in the kitchen awhile before somebody ran it out.  When it finally came, the fish was greasy, the fries were over seasoned, and they forgot my coleslaw.  I asked the bartender and he said it did not come with coleslaw.  I showed him on the menu that it did.  It seemed as if he didn't know the menu.  The manager later brought me the coleslaw which had a strange taste (maybe cilantro?).  The bartender later said sorry that he did not bring out the food and didn't realize that they didn't bring me the coleslaw.   When my bill came, it was wrong.  He had charged me with higher priced beer so that had to be corrected. I'm giving this restaurant such a low rating because the service staff just didn't seem to care about the customer and the food was marginal.  I don't plan to return anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ebensburg-2
Alicia S.,"Ebensburg, PA",70,4,1,1.0,12/3/2016,"When they opened this place, everyone was excited it was in our town.  Our 1st visit: The food was terrible and overpriced.  On our 2nd visit to give it another try: We were seated in the bar area with our infant son for over 20min and no one waited on us.  The place was very empty at the time, except for a few tables!  We decided to take both kids out for lunch today, only because we had a gift card.  What a disaster.  From the hostess calling our SON a girl.  To the waitress questioning us when we asked for booster seats.  To the beers that cost more than a Steeler Playoff Game at Heinz Field.  To the half assed plate of food that I was served.  The waitress and manager both said that was absolutely normal to receive half a plate of food that looked less than appealing.  It's also VERY CLEARLY not a child friendly establishment!!!!  I honestly don't know how this place stays in business.  They need to shut it down and put something locally owned there.  We will never be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ebensburg-2
Melissa A.,"Jenkintown, PA",0,16,2,5.0,10/10/2016,"My husband and I were visiting family and stopped here for dinner. The place was packed with teenagers in formal attire. The hostess told us we had a 20 minute wait or could sit at the bar. We sat at the bar and don't regret it. The bartender was very attentive and friendly, despite having a bar full of costumers. Our food was great, quick to come out and cooked exactly how we asked. Very clean and tidy bathroom. Several televisions on with a variety of sports games to watch. Prices are very reasonable. Decent seasonal beer selection also!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ebensburg-2

Andrea W.,"Ebensburg, PA",85,201,214,2.0,10/4/2015,"Let me first say, I'm not a fan of chains.  However, when with company that prefers chains, I go with the flow.  My two experiences at Ebensburg Applebee's were enough to remind me why I avoid chains though. The food was subpar, and both times my friend and I were seated next to families with screaming toddlers who made no attempt to quiet the kids.  This was particularly annoying since there were plenty of other available tables in the place.  I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ebensburg-2
