Katie G.,"El Cajon, San Diego, CA",453,291,774,3.0,9/20/2017,"Go here for the drinks and friendly service not the food .  We had the boneless buffalo wings and cheese sticks for appetizers . Those were good . But the chicken tenders and fries were pretty bad . The chicken tenders were over cooked making them hard . We also ordered the half rack of Bbq ribs and onion rings . The rings were good , but the ribs were so over cooked they were gross . I've never had ribs that bad .  This was not the first time the food was not satisfactory . I've dined here many times over the years .  All the drinks I've had here are always really good and a good price and the service is always good . I recommend drinks and apps only .

Julia V.,"La Mesa, CA",133,3,1,5.0,12/1/2017,"I was honestly thoroughly impressed with the pepper crusted sirloin & whole grains entitled with hearty grains, basaltic mushrooms, roasted grape tomatoes, onions and fresh sautéed spinach. I was really worried about coming to an Applebees which I haven't been in what seems like ages, because many of the options are hard to tailor to my diet and necessary portion size. I felt that this dish was spectacular in flavor, ingredients, texture, as well and the juiciness of the steak. I will definitely be coming back fin r this dish and I hope you do too",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-el-cajon-6

Jeffrey C.,"La Mesa, CA",1,11,,3.0,11/23/2017,"We were immediately greeted and seated. Service was friendly and timely. As far as the food, it's on the level of a TV dinner. To it's credit, a better TV dinner like a Stouffers.  We had the 2 for 25 deal. The appetizer was the chicken strips. Portion: Decent. Taste: 5 1/2. Deep fried to a crisp. It came with ranch dressing that lacked flavor. It's obviously the cheap version. I had the 1/2 rack of ribs. It seemed overdone from the day before. Where do they get such small ribs? I know I can't find these in any supermarket this small. Must come from a small ranch. Portion: Small(est) Taste: 5 Sides: Fries and broccoli. Fries were average. The broccoli had good flavor. My guest had the chicken and 3-cheese Mac. The chicken came in strips that were deep fried. I know they stole them from the appetizer counter. As for the Mac, I swear they left off one or two of the three cheeses. Dryer side. Lacked any type of creaminess and flavor. No sides came with this dish. Taste: 4 Add ons: 2 bowls of French onion soup. First off, why are bowls the size of cups these days? Five bucks. Portion: Small. Taste: 4.5 Bill with tip: $41.00 Value: Poor. You will not leave here and say, ""Now that was a great meal!"". Unless you're a manager, employee, you got a comp so you lied, an investor, the landlord, or think that McDonalds is a family owned sit down restaurant.  Hey Applebees! Try eating your own food. Then hire a top rated chef to redo your recipes. Then you might stay in business for another year.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-el-cajon-6

Katrina A.,"San Diego, CA",261,77,241,4.0,11/22/2016,"Every time were in El Cajon We meet up with our friend and we eat dinner. That's our thing. That's what we do so we always think of somewhere to eat when we meet up. This time around we were near Parkway Plaza Mall so we yelped what's near here and brought us to Applebees.  It was super packed in the lobby on a Saturday night around 6pm, Duh what'd we expect? Although we got seated pretty quickly. 3 adults one booster seat and a highchair to put a baby in a baby seat in. We were comfortable.  There's plenty to choose in the menu and if you're like me you'll probably have about 3 options. Right now looking at the lighter side* I got the bourbon Chicken and Shrimp with mushrooms and caramelized onions. Delightful and satisfying! Chicken wasn't all dry or anything. My boy got a burger with fries and when he got his plate he goes ""That's all the fires I get"" I guess it was a small portion because he was still hungry by the time his plate was finished.  Our 4 year old friend got 3 mozzarella sticks and one hamburger and we picked at her mozzarella sticks because took her all of eternity to eat her hamburger.  Our friend Got the steak with broccoli and mashed potatoes and look do we have here a free side of macaroni and cheese with sprinkles of bacon bites because they got her order wrong.

We bought the two for $20 and then spent $30 in alcohol (mixed drinks were somewhat watered down). The credit card machine went down and everyone was freaking out. I was over all of it and used the ATM outside across the parking lot. $5 dollar fee from the bank and probably more fees from my bank.  This credit card situation was completely managed incorrectly.  Even though my server was nice, we will not return.

George E.,"Chula Vista, CA",105,219,854,5.0,11/12/2016,"I came to this Applebee's for the free Veterans Day Dinner on the invitation of fellow Veterans. I must say It far exceeded my experience of the Applebee's on Palomar in Chula Vista.  It was a very busy night.We arrived at 8pm. We were seated promptly. Raylee was our server. She was very attentive. More so than any Applebee's server.  She was friendly and I could tell that she genuinely cared about us. She thanked us for our service  and she was sincere about it. Not a mere Thank you  because she happened to be scheduled on Veterens Day. They offered about a half dozen choices on a special Veteran's menu. I chose the Butchers Meat and Potatoes. What it lacked in quantity it made up in quality. I have to say that I was disappointed.  they should have placed it on a smaller plate for the visual effect.  It was a small piece of sirloin onions tomatoes and gravy on top a small bed of mashed potatoes. Carlos, the manager stopped by our table chatted a bit, and thanked us for our service. He surprised  us with desert a brownie with ice cream. A great end to our meal. I hadn't been to an Applebee's since July 21st as that experience was far less than desirable.  The El Cajon store restored my faith in Applebees. If you are at Office Depot  or Best Buy and all that shopping makes you hungry stop in at Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-el-cajon-6?start=20
Jared O.,"La Mesa, San Diego, CA",0,5,1,1.0,7/31/2017,This review is mainly on the staff that Applebee's hires to answer the phones and take online orders. I always try and take advantage of online ordering after a busy day of work. But my last 2 experiences with this location is just enough. Every time I call multiple women who answer the phone never know the menu put me on hold sometimes I've had it to where I've got hung up on. The last 2 times I've ordered food and it was brought out to me it was wrong and not even close to what I ordered. It's just a waste of time for me and restaurant when people answering the phones have no clue on what they are doing. Bottom line is food has always tasted good here but service wise has been garbage and honestly I don't even feel like coming here anymore because of it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-el-cajon-6?start=20

Cream D.,"La Mesa, CA",38,6,2,1.0,10/11/2017,NEVER HAD WORST SERVICE! Last Thursday my party and I waited over 20 min for a table (which was fine it was busy) we were finally sat at our table at 730pm as soon we sat down the waitress took our drink AND FOOD order (since I was with my 3 year old daughter and 6month old niece we made sure to look at the menu while we waited to be seated since anyone with kids knows their patience is short) First of all I drove from mission valley area to applebees for the $1 drinks they are promoting as soon we order them we were told they only have 1 flavor (not what is advertised) but whatever we order the 1 flavor. about 805 our apps came the cheese sticks where cold and cheese was hard like biting into an eraser you could tell they have been sitting. After waiting trying to give them benefit of doubt I finally asked to see a manger around 825. His name is NESS I believe. He came to the table and 1/2 a** apologized by saying the kitchen is backed up and WE COULD PAY FOR THE FOOD N DRINKS THAT HAD BEEN SERVED AND LEAVE...... No mention of comp. I have NO PROBLEM paying for my food my order was gonna be well over $40. So overall I completely wasted a night that was supposed to be full of good food and laughs with my dinner party instead I left very angry and still had to go buy food else where.

But before I left I figured out a side of mushroom toppers that I ordered wasn't in the bag so I let one of the workers know, I was asked by at least 4 different employees what I needed before one of the girls realized none of those 4 workers were going to check on the mushrooms. Already bad service, then I come to find I need to wait a little while.. Ok i asked how long they said 5min.. I waited at least 15min just for a side of sautéed mushrooms..

My husband's meal that was supposed to be 8 oz sirloin with mashed potatoes was basically 2 small steak medallions that were over cooked and very grisly. The ""mashed potatoes"" were really just potato flakes with lumps (maybe a mixture of real potatoes and fake?) My mac-n-cheese with honey pepper chicken meal was all-around gross and I couldn't even finish it - it's definitely not made with real, fresh cheese and the chicken was tough. My 11 year old son said his burger tasted OK, though. I don't understand why people continue to come back here with as bad as the food is, especially for the price. It's not fresh at all, and it's over-salted. Applebee's is just a glorified fast food chain. You're better off going to your neighborhood Jack-in-the-Box.

Wedge salad was 1st rate, as good as I've ever tasted at any restaurant. The Burbon chicken shrimp was sizzling many minutes after it was delivered and did not disappoint! Very good flavor and texture throughout. Attention salmon lovers: my cedar plank salmon was again, one of the best I've ever tasted.

Christopher S.,"La Mesa, CA",32,91,5,2.0,2/2/2015,"Ummmmhmmm were to start. First let's start on the quality of the food. ho, the food was horrible. But for a chain restaurant you would expect some decency is their taste. There is no flavor in their food , just a lot of dirty oil that should proabaly be cleaned (if your food was deep fried).  Second the service was disgusting , the waiter would not smile . Every time he would come to our table it was as if he was upset to be working. It came to the point were we felt as if he was mad at the world and could be tainting the food. The only reason I gave them a two  star was the fact their manager was super nice and super sweet. But this is not enough to make me ever wanna come back to this establishment or any of their chain reasturant as well.  All in all I don't know how this location is still in business it should be closed, but I guess some people don't know what a standard of decent service is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-el-cajon-6?start=60

The Pros:  - Our server was nice and polite - The staff were courteous and nice - The inside of the restaurant was clean (minus the bathrooms, see below) The Cons: - The food was so salty that my kid didn't want to finish it - The ribs had almost no meat on them, were burnt, and were super salty as well - The bowl that our mac and cheese and chicken came on still had old food crusted on it - The bathrooms were questionable, at best (maybe just the time we happened to be there?) We tipped our server well because of how polite he was, but we don't think we will be visiting this restaurant again. The food left a lot to be desired and again, was extremely salty. Having your food served on a dirty plate is also a little off-putting.

Jack M.,"San Diego, CA",5000,4068,28004,3.0,11/16/2014,"I was craving a grilled cheese and I heard Applebee's offered a four cheese grill offered with so basil tomato soup. I ordered that, and a bar bite size wedge salad with blue cheese and bacon.  The wedge arrived first and it was a very good size for a $5 bar bite ( ). This was a good deal and tasted quite good. The ice berg was fresh and crisp and the bacon crunchy and flavorful. Once I got through the top layer, it did need a little more blue cheese dressing, but it was not a big deal since you can get more on the side ( ). I would order this again, but I would suggest they offer fresh cracked black pepper with the salad.  The Four Cheese Grille was good, but it arrived as if it was sitting at the pass a little to long because the bread was lukewarm and the cheese had already started to congeal ( ). It tasted very good, especially all the four cheeses together, but I rather of eaten it piping hot with cheese actively slowly dripping out, not stationary ( ). Nevertheless, the grilled cheese was great for dipping in the thick and tasty tomato basil soup ( ). The cup of soup came with some good croutons and the soup was thicker than most and quite good ( ).  Sarah, my server was great. She was very friendly and appropriately attentive. She brought me more hot water for my tea and gave me some insight about their happy specials and such.

Linda J.,"San Diego, CA",738,911,4236,2.0,11/24/2012,"We started with drinks, a Mountain Dew and a water with lemon please? We asked from our waitress Savonne B. and the drinks were brought out promptly.  I want to start with telling you how awesome this waitress really was.  If I had to hire someone I would really hire her!  So, the first drink came with something that was a small black ball that was not really floating at the bottom of the soda glass.  I took a picture and posted it immediately.  When we told Savonne she apologized profusely promising to bring us another soda which arrived in a minimal amount of time.  The second Mountain Dew was presented and right when a sip was about to be taken we noticed a bug at the top of the glass.  Really? Again?  I could not believe this!  Savonne apologized again and then said she would have the manager come over and he did.  Jamie T. came over and announced who he was.  I was pretty shocked at him saying that we requested him to come over which we did not.  We told him the problem and he said he would check on that immediately and appreciated our feedback.  Sometimes things happen in restaurants right?  Meanwhile, our meals were brought out.  I ordered the Lemon Shrimp Fettuccine~Seared plump shrimp, ripe tomatoes, onions, sautéed fresh spinach and basil served over fettuccine noodles lightly tossed in a roasted garlic cream sauce and topped with artichokes, lemon zest and Parmesan.  My man ordered the Sizzling steak fajitas~Served with lettuce, sour cream, pico de gallo, rice, sautéed onions & red peppers, fire roasted poblanos and white cheddar. Steak and Chicken.  My dish looked wonderful.  My man's plate did not have the Chicken that was ordered and the rice that was served was burning on the hot plate.  So again, we had to find Savonne to let her know yet something else has gone wrong.  Jaime brought out the chicken about 5 minutes later.  As I was eating I also noticed that my silverware was really dirty but at this point I am so drained from complaining and it was almost time for our movie that I needed to order an Appletini.  I have never had one before and NOW seemed like a great time for one.  The drink was really fruity and had a nice taste to it and I can now say that I have had one.  I would never order it again but that is no fault to Applebee's.  The cool part about the drink was the carved out pieces of apple on a small sword~ I liked that.  The manager Jaime came back to advise us that they found the source of the bugs at the tap of the Mountain Dew spout and that it has now been resolved which was pretty cool.   Yes, we ate the food and it was actually really good considering the shortcomings that came previously.  Savonne came over to offer us a ""Sunday dessert shooter"" for the inconvience to which we decided to pass on.   If you read my reviews I am not very nice and will tell it like it is.  Long story made midsize, lol is that the food was great once they got it right.  The service was wonderful from both the waitress and the manager however I have never sat at home saying ""ooh I want to go and eat at blah blah because their service is great and the food is good but everything else is dirty except the bathrooms!""  I think that they may need to have Bar Rescue come in to explain how to not stack glasses so that they are not dirty at the rim of the glasses and how to keep the bugs out. PS: The bathrooms were really clean and they do have a diaper changing station in the ladies.  I also liked the fact that they sponser local sports teams and have their pictures all over the walls.  They have more than just sports stuff showing on the Tv's.  I had to give this a 2 star because of the filth and the wrong orders coming out.  Otherwise this could have been a 4 or 5!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-el-cajon-6?start=80

Jeneva C.,"San Diego, CA",10,134,85,1.0,5/21/2015,Went here for a late night last minute bite to eat with my husband. He wasnt hungry so only I ate. Cant mess up one dish right? Wrong! I ordered the most simple thing on the menu which is all I get any and everywhere. Chicken tenders! So we were there at around 830 so it wasn't too busy.  Seated fast and I ordered.  Got the plate of food in literally 5-7minutes. I was in shock. I even said Wow that was fast and the kid said yup thats applebees. I said yea but is it fresh. Anyways so the fries were hot and fresh so I figured wow maybe they are just fast. NO! My chicken yes was hot very hot but CHEWY!! like jerky. I told my waitress but figured ehhh ill just eat it bc I was hungry and it was late.  After trying each other piece I realized it was all 3 pieces. I told her I wanted to change it and she was nice but gave me rebuttles for everything I said. Even had the nerve to say well thats how tenders are cut so they're supposed to be chewy!!! Im sorry miss but I have had chicken strips at every place even down to red lobster and cheesecake factory. Not to mention my husband was a butcher for 10 yrs so yes I know how tenders are cut dear!!! I was beyond shocked that she was trying to even justify them... i said forget it ill eat them!! She sent the manager over for IDK what but he was more apologetic but again at that point I had eaten half the chewy chicken. I came to realize that maybe they tossed them back in the fryer which is why they were hot but probably why they were so overcooked and served so fast! I was craving what I went in for which was desert so I still ordered it. Thats the only reason this place is even getting any stars. I figured I wouldve been comped the nasty chicken or even a free soda sheesh but nope not a second look. Therefore the bad review. You're welcome Applebees!!

Blair C.,"San Diego, CA",151,61,130,2.0,4/2/2015,"Sad to actually go back and write another review after giving them 5 stars before. That first time we went there it was truly amazing, delicious and like no Applebee's we had ever had. We went back two more time and both times the food was below par. Don't know how it fell so far from what we had had that first time. The macaroni was gross and watery and the sandwich my boyfriend got was alright but my food was just gross. The service was great there and the waitresses are very sweet. Not to be a pain or try to just get something free, I let our server know how soft and watery my food was and that was the reason I didn't really eat much. I just told her to let her know so maybe they could tell the chef whatever he was doing it was not good. The manager was nice and offered a free desert but I had no appetite for anything else and neither did my boyfriend. So he took half off the pasta. Which is nice but honestly all I want is to let them know the quality of their food has sadly and drastically dropped. After those two times we went after my first review we really haven't gone back. It was so gross I would just rather spent my money elsewhere so it's a shame.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-el-cajon-6?start=80

Sarah M.,"Santee, CA",19,15,5,3.0,2/4/2016,"Took my two grown boys and their father there for his birthday on a Sunday afternoon.  The server was nice enough, but the food was not hot enough.  I don't know why they don't keep it warm for service.  It was as if mine was done first so parts of it were left to wait for the rest of the food to be made.  I had the riblets with chipotle and it had no flavor whatsoever, so I ordered regular bbq sauce, which I found to be too spicy.  The riblets were good, just enough meat for me.  We had the spinach dip appetizer, and it seems a lot smaller than it used to be, as the dip goes.  I didn't like how the server did not come back to check on our food within five minutes, I had to wait a while while my food got cold to ask for the sauce, and more water.  I do restaurant secret shopper reviews as a side job and this place really needs to employ such a service, if they do not already, and use it to make some improvements.  I understand it was a busy time of day but when we got there there was no one else waiting so it wasn't terribly busy.  I did like that the server didn't forget special requests that were made, and let us move to a larger table when one came available, as we were really cramped in a booth.  I would have given it 4 stars if the food had been warmer and the service more frequent.  Not bad for the price, overall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-el-cajon-6?start=80
Crystal K.,"Jamul, CA",18,61,15,2.0,1/12/2015,"I'm not even going to rate the food quality. Its a chain restaurant with discount specials and international commercials.  This is for the ridiculous pricing policy on their happy hour menu.  Not sure if its a corporate decision or a local management one.... Anyways, came in with a group of five. Was seated and noticed that Happy Hour included all NFL games. It was the 1st quarter of the Seattle/Carolina playoffs so we asked our server if we could get the HH prices on our drinks. He informed us it was for bar only but we could buy at the bar and bring them to our seats. Bartender said no have to drink them in the bar area but that the bar area included all the seated tables surrounding the bar and to just ask the server for HH pricing. So again ask the server for HH pricing and told our table wasn't in the bar... So the table 4 feet next to us is and our table isn't??? Yeap. So you want to double charge us because our seats are 4 feet away from the other table? Yeap. We ended up moving and then the hostess informs us that its not Happy Hour after all. We pointed out the menus that stated all NFL games included HH pricing and we couldn't help but notice the blaring playoff game showing from every corner. Oh sorry yeah we'll give you the correct price.  So all in all, you may be paying full price while the table next to yours is getting them half off....

Mike T.,"San Diego, CA",1,8,18,1.0,8/10/2015,"This is where I'm coming from. If I come to your establishment, move my schedule to eat with my family, you better make it worth my time. Your standards need to be high because I'm eating food that you are serving.  Before I even walk in, you need to convince me that your restaurant is worth the effort. It's all perception. As I read these 5 star reviews, I can't help but think the managers friends have been asked to review this restaurant. Maybe the locals at the bar have been asked to post a positive review, but I just didn't see it. I don't even want you to give me a refund of my money or a discount. Because of that point, it's too late. Just get it right the first time so you don't have to make excuses about how you screwed it up! The last time we were at this Applebee's was almost a year ago.  The reason why we had not returned was because of the service and substandard food.  I know that sometimes people have bad days, but you don't let it affect your work. We decided to give them a second try, maybe after year things have changed. Well, nothing has. We where made to wait when there where tables avalible. We were sat at tables we could have been seated in 15 minutes ago. They seem to have a lack of staff/servers, not my problem. Server appologised for entering other tables data first. I asked twice for the same drink order. Appetizers came out with no plates presented from manager There was minimal table maintenance, beverage refills, table cleanup etc. Server looked overwhelmed. No sence on ergency from the staff. No pacing of the meal. The gap between serving kids and serving the adults was 15 min.  Warmer than room temp ranch dressing, notified server, and no attenpt to fix it. Other tables near us had issues as well so this was not an isolated incident. Mac n cheese pasta was ok. not the sauce. This looks like a management issue. After being in food service and managing food service, this is mostly about training and standards. The Applebee's in Rancho San Diego is much better, much more efficient and just better at what they do.

Simone R.,"El Cajon, CA",36,3,,1.0,8/18/2014,"I came to applebees for my 21'st birthday. I ordered my first legal drink of my life and it was served with a LIVING MOVING FLY in it. I told the manager and was told I would get a replacement. After literally 5 minutes and watching others get their drinks I contacted the manager Reggie again. I was told ""it was a mistake and he was replacing it"" I explained it had been 5 minutes, and that we had already been there an entire hour and we wanted to leave since nothing was being done. We ended up still paying for my husbands 8$ drink and leaving without our food order to go to Chili's instead. Last year on the same day for lunch I visited this restaurant as well and my order was served wrong. The manager then comped our food or at least half of it (I no longer have receipt), and really made up for it. I have no idea why more was not done for me on my birthday at this location. Applebees should have been honored to serve me my first legal alcoholic drink and instead I left with nothing but an 8$ loss for a drink we didn't even finish. I called Chris Sumner regional manager 11/12/13 and now on 11/14/13 still have not received a response to my voice-mail. Even Chili's said we should have walked out and not paid.

I have been to this Applebees many times because I have been invited and always hope that I have a good experience (but never happens). Their food does not taste good, cooked badly, or they mess up the order. One time I ordered some ribs and they were so hard, dry, burned, and looked like they were sitting out for days. It was hard as a rock when I bit into it that I spit it out without even chewing and returned it to the kitchen. This was not something I normally do but in this case, it was a must.The waitress agreed that the ribs looked awful and was nice about it. I decided to order something else from then on because of that disaster. Another time I went for the 2 for $20 and noticed their selection was not great but I still tried it and the food came out bland. It later made my stomach sick so not sure if the food was properly cooked or if it was the oils they use. The only good thing were the drinks, appetizers, and desserts. Recently, my friend invited me for dinner and I told her the past horror stories of my bad experiences and she hoped we'd have a good one. This time we didn't even eat because I asked for a sangria and the waitress could not accept my ID that expired 2 weeks ago. I told her to give me a break cuz I'm over 30yrs old and it takes the DMV 4-6 weeks to send the new ID in the mail! I had my online renewal receipt in my wallet. The waitress said she would ask her manager and sure enough she came back and said the manager said no.  I thought it was very unprofessional that the manager did not come to the table. Instead the manager decided to not even show his face or deal with us in person. For all I know, she could've walked to the kitchen and back without even asking the manager.

Apparently the kid's mac n' cheese is about half a cup, our waitress was blissfully unaware that iced teas are refillable (I had to ask her three times just to see a single refill in 20 minutes), and didn't bother to let us know that the tomato basil soup my wife ordered as her main course wasn't available today until all our dishes came out, instead attempting to sub it with a side salad without even a word. Really, guys? So she has to order something else, a burger (more food and definitely more money than she planned or wanted, but the rest of the family has their food now, so leaving is hardly an option), and wait for it to come out long after the kids and I have finished our dinners. The manager pops by while we're waiting and asks how our food is... We tell her about the ""mix up"" and her response is a weak shrug. Much later, she comes by and asks if we want a molten gooey brownie explosion or somesuch. This, after I (diabetic) ordered the low-cal asiago steak and my wife (obviously not looking for a big meal) attempted to order a simple bowl of soup. No, we certainly were not interested in the 1500 calorie brownie. After we politely turn down the incomprehensible offer, we're treated with another half-hearted shrug and the manager's backside.

Lauren P.,"La Presa, San Diego, CA",7,34,15,1.0,1/12/2013,"WORST SERVICE EVER! I would give this place zero stars if I could. This is the worst service I have ever had. We've only been here three times and each time was worse than the last. The last time was the last straw.  We came to watch a football game, and a specific game at that. There was another playoff game going on right before and ended up going into overtime, overlapping with the game we came to see. We asked our server if they could change the channel of the tv right in from of our table to a different game, and first she told us the 49ers weren't playing that day. Knowing she wasn't the brightest we assured her they were, but she said they could not change the channel until the broncos game was over because everyone in the bar came to see that game. Not really understanding why they couldn't change one tv out of the 10 TVs in the whole place, we patiently waited for the game to end.  Having to get updates from ESPN on our phones, we asked one of the managers if he could change the channel to the game we came here to see, and were currently missing. He said the same thing, that everyone else there was watching it and they would change the channel when the game was over.  So we waited more, missing the more of the niners game. When the broncos game went to double overtime we began getting very upset because we shouldn't have to miss our game, I mean they have ten TVs for god sakes. We asked a second manager why we couldn't just change the channel on the tv in front of us since we appeared to be the only ones looking at it. He said the tv is connected to the main tv in the bar and they have to be on the same channel and they won't change the main tv until that game was over. Ok I can understand that. But instead of the manager coming up with a solution to keep his customers happy, we had to ask if we could be seated near a less main tv to change the channel of the tv. He said he would go look for a new table to move us to.  He was gone for about 10 min, serving food to several tables and avoiding us. The ravens ended up scoring, finally ending the game. We were happy to be able to finally watch the game we solely came here to watch. As we were waiting for the manager to return, or someone to change the channel whichever came first, the bartender changed the channel of the main tv at the bar.  Oddly enough the channel on our tv never changed. Which according to the manager they were connected so if you change one you change both. My boyfriend became enraged, understandably. When the manager finally returned we explained why we were so mad and asked why the manager lied to us. He had no answer. When further explaining that we wasted our time, were lied to and received horrible service he had nothing to say. No solution, no apology, nothing to try and continue our service here. He just blankly stared at us and walked away.  So we won't continue our service here. No one should.  In only three times they have lost our business. The management team here is a joke and give no effort at customer service whatsoever.

Nick G.,"Berkeley, CA",3,9,,1.0,4/28/2009,"I'm a skeptic of 1-star reviews but I think that this place warrants one, particularly when the 2-star review on Yelp is described as one to convey the sentiment of having had ""better experiences [elsewhere]"" which would be a grotesquely unfair assessment of this restaurant. I've had a better experience at every other dining location except for perhaps Applebee's neighbor, On the Border, which I would say is an equal failure. I'm going to try and give a brief summation as to not bore my fellow Yelpers but still be fair to those gastronomists who so eagerly read reviews of chain restaurants. The service was abysmal. The servers seemed annoyed, unhelpful and were very jerk-like for a lack of a nicer term throughout the entire evening, almost to the point where I didn't think they deserved any type of gratuity compensation. I would have much preferred to walk into the kitchen myself and get my plate in order to avoid such poisonous personalities. I was too tired to do that though, and I think it might be a health department violation to have customers in the kitchen (though I doubt highly that this in particular was their concern given the uncleanliness of the place).  Moving right along, I could have gotten better-tasting food at Costco at a much lower price. Now, to be fair, I'm not comparing Applebee's to Cirque 2000; in fact, I think the rule of measurement I'm utilizing here is Chilli's (which is ironically near the La Mesa Costco) which is far superior in every sense of the word superior and I think even slightly less expensive. Essentially, Applebee's food was over-seasoned, at room temperature and over-priced. Even their water was nasty (how can you fail at water?).  To top the wonderful evening off, exiting the fabulous gourmet experience that is Applebee's, I was confronted by a glaring sign on the exit doors that informed me that after my wonderful experience, I might be contracting some form of cancer because this particular location has ""chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects..."". This is ""eating good in the neighborhood""? I think only M. Night Shyamalan could come up with the proper antithesis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-el-cajon-6?start=140

Melissa L.,"Lake Forest, CA",129,30,52,1.0,11/2/2011,"Seriously... why is there no option for restaurants that suck more than ""Eek! Methinks not.""?! There should be a ""F*ck! NEVER again!!"" option. My fiance is my foodie partner so we're always down to try something new. I have never been to Applebee's before, but he compared it to Chili's which is okay in my book. We were sat immediately and I ripped open the menu excited to see what they have... yeah. Nothing special. I mean, I like to eat and seriously nothing jumped out at me. This was definitely an omen!  I ended up ordering the Southwest Jalapeno Burger (burger, pepper-jack cheese, candied jalapenos, chipotle mayo, lettuce, tomato, onions). Sounds good right? It was disgusting!! And for as long as it took to come out, I figured it would have looked and tasted amazing- wrongo. The burger was so greasy that the oils consumed the bun and I'm pretty sure it had been used in a game of hockey in the kitchen. Puke. Oh and lettuce and tomatoes? MIA. So picture in your head: a brownish, oily smooshed burger. The fries were horrible too. Definitely not fresh... especially after being under the heat lamps for so long (the plate my burger was on was beyond hot!). My fiance ordered the 12 oz. New York Strip, which comes with seasonal vegetable and your choice of garlic mashed potatoes or a baked potato. Because there are no available substitutions (lame) he went with the veggies and the garlic mashed potatoes. The state of his plate was ridiculous. His steak looked as fake as a McRib, he got a tablespoon of potatoes and maybe 6 tiny veggies. It looked like baby food on a serving platter- that's how sad the portions were. He cut into his steak and the texture inside was so weird... pretty much like pureed meat shaped into a steak. But they made sure to put 3 grill marks on it-yipee. He tried his potatoes and there was definitely no garlic in there, it was just powdery and tasteless fluff (someone at a geriatric home is missing their tatoes).  All in all, horrific experience. I was actually stunned when the waitress served the entrees and then asked if everything looked okay. Even Helen Keller would've flipped her off. Eff Applebee's!

With it being newly remodeled, it has really made it known that they are doing what they need to do to get better. The girls and their friend ordered off the kids menu, (2) orders of Chicken Tenders and a Chicken Breast sandwich. All three were very pleased with what they got. I must say, the Chicken breast sandwich looked pretty damn good. My wife ordered the Chicken Tender Platter which comes with 7 Tenders, Coleslaw, and french fries. The Chicken was cooked perfeclty, nice and crispy on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside. I know, I know, its just Chicken Tenders, But... I have had some rank ass Chinken Tenders before. These were good.  I ordered the Applebees Reuben. Honestly, not their best sandwich but it was do-able. The problem was not the contents of the sandwich, even though the meat seemed like it was straight out of a package of pastrami you can buy at the store, it was the soggy bottom. The bottom of the sandwich was so saturated with the contents from inside the sandwich it really seemed that it sat and waited under the heat lamp for the rest of the order to get done. Kind of disappointing.  Other than that, the service was good, the happy hour was descent, I mean, my wife had a Margarita that she said tasted like straight bottle mix, and I had a beer. I dont drink fizzy yellow beer often, but when I do. I prefer Dos Equis. Ha Ha Ha Ha, just being dumb. Really though, with the bar being remodeled also, I was really hoping to see more a of a selection tap wise. Its really pretty weak actually. Bud Light, Dos Equis, Coors Light, Blue Moon and Sam Adams Boston Lager. It would just be cool for them to consider throwing on a few more Micro brews. Carry some local guys on your taps.

A blonde hostess and bussed were talking at a table across from us for a few minutes about weekend plans.

The boneless buffalo wings were pretty tasty and its one of the things Applebees does well.  We gobbled them up in no time.  Next out came our entrees.....my chicken strips were pretty tasty and they always have decent french fries at Applebees.  My wifes pasta dish on the other hand was absolutely horrible.  It tasted funky, was lukewarm and overall just sick.  She only ate a few bites of it.  Our server Mike (awesome dude and the only reason this review gets 3 stars) came to clear out our plates and noticed she didn't eat much of it.  He asked if we didn't like it and my wife told him yes.  He apologized and said he wished we would have told him earlier and he would have traded it out for something else.  All was good at that point.  My wife was still hungry though so she decided to order a side salad.  A few minutes later the manager came out with the salad and apologized again for the crappy pasta.  My wife finished that and when Mike came back with the bill, they actually took the pasta dish off the bill which was an awesome good faith gesture.  We paid the bill, I left Mike a fat tip and we were on our way.   Without the gift cards, I would never choose to come here because the food is always just average.  You never hear of someone telling stories about the ""awesome meal they had at Applebees"".  The service was on point though and Mike deserves some props.  He was constantly refilling our drinks without asking and checking on us throughout.   It was really nice that they removed the pasta from the bill too.  Most places would say, ""Too bad so sad....don't order it next time....lesson learned"".  Applebees made it right though and for that we are appreciative!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-el-cajon-6?start=120

About the service.  I don't know how they do it, but I've never had a bad server at Applebee's.  We're not *that* demanding, but we do churn through several refills on drinks during a meal.  Our server has never yet failed to notice and have refills on the way.  Service is really the big difference between a lot of these chains, and I have no problem saying Applebee's seems to have a good training regimen, or just better hiring practices, from what I can see.  If I could add half a star for this, I would. Specific dishes?  I usually get the Riblets, as they're nicely slow-cooked, and they have a variety of sauces.. one of them even sufficiently spicy for my taste.  Their salads are standard... no surprises; I do wish they'd add a little local dressing fare like a jalapeno vinaigrette - just something different.  They pride themselves on their steaks, but this isn't really the place for good beef.   Pasta is pretty standard... I don't really have it, though my wife does and likes it (much like anything in a cream sauce). The bar is not bad; perfectly acceptable for this level of restaurant... maybe a little better.  One nice thing is they don't inundate the rest of the seating area with loud music just because a bar is in the place.  They also have nicely sized TVs for catching the game. All in all, I get exactly what I expect at a place like this, and unexpectedly good service.  It's cheap too!  2 adult meals plus app for $20 and one kids meal turns into a bargain night out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-el-cajon-6?start=120

The best waitress was Tiffany.  So my son informs me that his school is having a fundraiser at this location on 11/29/11. Ok lets go. The was no line waiting to be seated, so far so good. I ask to be seated in Tiffany's area, but I was informed that she moved to a different store. Dang!  We were seated by some guy. I did not get his name. But while we were waiting for the apps and my soup we consumed our drinks. I started looking around and I found our server! He was chatting it up with the bartender,,,lol. Finally he returns with the apps for my son and a friend. Where's my soup? I wait patiently, I am offered a mozzarella stick to eat which was soooo yummy. Still waiting. Now I'm at the point that I have to go to the bathroom from the coffee I've had in place of my soup. On my way back to the table I don't see our server again, and don't see my soup on the table, so I see another server and inform her that my son has been done with his app and I still don't have my soup. I just said the cancel it.  Then our server comes out and brings my soup saying that he was sorry it took so long and that he took it off the bill. That was nice. Our food arrives. My son had that 2 for 20 deal. I'm not saying that I'm a food Whor*, but I had to laugh at the size of his food. I'd have to agree with another post that the steak was the size of a mc rib! lol My son is 15 so it kinda looked like a happy meal. they should rename the 2 for 20 ,,,,,half the size of normal meals. 15 minutes after we returned home my son was eating a cereal bar.  I had a very good steak. I ordered it med. rare because I know if I didn't it would have been dry. For some reason it must be cheaper to make mask potatoes vs. veggies. I had 2 huge scoops of the potatoes and a small amount of veggies that were not done. The were not hot and were rock hard.....they were raw. Towards the end of our meal our server came to give us our check. My son and I had a lively conversation about how much to tip him. I said the bare minimum. He wanted to give him a bit more. As we were talking about this where do you think the server was at?.........Yup the bar again talking to the cute bartender....lol My son sided with me. You get what you pay for here. I guess if they had outstanding customer services then people would over look the bland menu. Most of the stuff on the menu is about the same it's weird.
