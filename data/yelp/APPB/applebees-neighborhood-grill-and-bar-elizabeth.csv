Monique T.,"Newark, NJ",1,15,5,3.0,4/17/2016,"Just walked out of Applebee's and I can say I had excellent service by a wonderful server  (Jorlin). Ordered 2 apps and 3 entrees. The apps were nice and hot and yummy. 2 out of 3 entrees were cooked well and when I sent my meal back, they were nothing but apologetic.  My server kept checking on me and the status of my meal and apologizing even though it was out of his control. By the time my meal came to me, my party had finished eating. It was cooked properly though and they comped it to make up for the inconvenience.  I have eaten at this Applebee's before and I will eat here again because I always get good customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-elizabeth?start=20
tania v.,"Kearny, NJ",0,2,,1.0,12/5/2016,I should have known the food was going to be bad. The quality at this food chain has significantly gotten worse over the last few years. The staff was okay to say the least. We order 2 steak entrees - I ordered mine medium and my sister ordered hers well done. The well done steak came out burnt and the medium came out how a well done steak should have come out. The fries were so stale I couldn't eat them (and I'm a fry fanatic). What a disappointment. Definitely the last time I'll be visiting an Applebees.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-elizabeth?start=20
Mikey H.,"San Diego, CA",352,821,2768,4.0,1/6/2014,"Our flight home was cancelled, and we were stuck in Newark, New Jersey.  We didn't know the area but when we couldn't get out on Saturday, I looked for a new hotel to stay at that was close to anything within walking distance.  We found this Applebee's at The Outlet Collection: Jersey Gardens. There was a little confusion at the host stand, but the hostess said 15 minutes, and it was actually 5.  We were given a table by the bar and in front of the kitchen doors, so we got to see the food coming out.  Some of it looked really good and some just average.  Our server, Ibn, stopped by and said he'd be with us shortly.  I didn't realize how deep the restaurant went.   We ordered two glasses of the Shiraz and fried mozzarella sticks.  It had been a while since we've eaten these gooey fried sticks that are not good for you but hey, we're still on vacation.  We also asked if they sold the wines by the bottle.  The only red we could get was a Cabernet by Cupcake.  I've seen this label, and the $30 price tag seemed steep considering you could buy this at Trader Joe's or Costco for much less, but we wanted wine!  I don't think people order bottles at Applebee's because our server said he'd never opened a bottle before.  The bartender ended up doing it for him. He: I'm just going to make a mess, so I'm going to leave it here for you. Luckily I still remember my food service skills...LOL!  I ordered the Napa Chicken and portobellos.  It is a very healthy dish with zucchini, purple onions, and red bell peppers.  I just wished the mushrooms were sauteed longer.  The partner had the honey peppered sirloin which was tender and easy to cut.  We did have to wait awhile for that bottle to arrive, but again, I don't think most people order bottles. Overall, it was a very nice dining experience.  A couple of the managers came by to ask how everything was.  Did we look like corporate?  LOL!  I can see how things can get a little chaotic, but all the workers we encountered were friendly.  We didn't encounter anything the other reviewers experienced.  Maybe we had their best server.  With not that many choices for us to walk to, this Applebee's was worth coming to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-elizabeth?start=20

After thirty minutes of waiting the waitress took our order, another twenty minutes waiting for the food -  one of the two dishes wrong, not what he had ordered.

Thomas K.,"Rutherford, NJ",78,502,401,2.0,7/26/2015,"With only a food court in the immediate vicinity, w opted to go for Applebee's:  A franchise we usually pass on.  Our bellies were calling for lunch after a morning marathon of shopping, and this is what we settled on: Grilled salmon:  cooked well, seasoned lightly, and served over vegetables.  Harmless, and unmemorable. Thai Shrimp Salad:  slightly under cooked shrimp, some greens, thai peanut dressing in a super small portion.  What did I expect for under 400 calories?  Not much more...just some more time on he grill for those shrimp.  I ate them, and I'm still alive. Service was fine, plenty of suggestive upselling from our server, cell phone use from the other band of merry servers that, with most of their ""street""-like attitudes shouldn't have been in the hospitality business at all.

Jennifer H.,"Rochester, NY",40,57,48,1.0,4/15/2014,"For me, Applebee's is the abusive relationship of restaurants. He/She doesn't treat you right, none of your friends understand what you see in him/her, and you always walk away promising yourself you'll never go back.... And then you're stuck in a mall when you stomach rumbles...and you think to yourself ""Maybe it's changed...maybe it really wasn't so bad"" So you go back. And, true to form, the food leaves you with a figurative ""black eye"". I don't like Applebees. Why do I do this to myself? Alas, the above ""Mall stomach rumble"" scenario happened to me while at the Jersey Garden's mall. I thought I would stop in for a better quality lunch than what one typically finds in the food court. And, thus, my first Yelp 1 star dining experience ensued.... As other posts noted, the hostess was fine. Greeted me courteously, seated me promptly. All was right with the world. Then, the fun began. I was seated next to the service station. Not across from, not a few tables away from....NEXT to the serving station. Imagine my surprise when it took quite some time for the server to recognize I was sitting in his section. Aside from the time it took to get noticed, the service as fine. The real blow came with the food. I ordered a lunch combo of the Fiesta Chopped Chicken Salad, and the Artisan Grilled Chicken Ciabatta. Now, I think most people that know me know I eat just about anything, and really don't complain. Let this be the lens with which you view this next statement. They were both TERRIBLE! (Charles Barkley/Taco Bell style TURRIBLE:  ).  The salad nearly blew my tastebuds out, in a bad way! Normally I like really flavorful food, but this was so bad I wondered if Ashton Kutcher was going to pop out to tell me I was being Punk'd. The salad looked like it was dressed with the bottom portion of an Italian Dressing bottle - you know, all the little bits and pieces...and then had tons of oil. I almost took a picture to prove my point, but I didn't think the image would come out. As for the sandwich - pray tell, what exactly qualifies it to receive the ""Artisan"" title? It looked like a Chik Fil-A sandwich. As for the condiments on the sandwich. I like to imagine the cook had an arm injury that made it too difficult to spread the condiments across the entire sandwich. That is honestly the only explanation. Avoid this place. Applebee's doesn't really love you, despite what it might say. It's going to fall back into the same old pattern, and there's only so many times you can use the ""I hit my eye on a cupboard"" excuse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-elizabeth?start=20

I have no idea if they heard me... applebees is what it is. This place is well under corporate standards. So.. I received two bowls of vegetables and no main dish...

Arika L.,"Antioch, CA",0,2,2,2.0,1/11/2015,"I was at Applebee's since 12 pm with no problems. I had two beers and a shot of Johnny walker. I had a salad because their food is either a hit or miss kind of deal. Later on I had another beer and their steak with Pappas (potatoes). Long story short, the bartender ""V,"" told her boss that she was cutting me off and I wasn't acting rude to her or the other bartender. I guess my Spanish was extremely bad that she thought I was drunk. So don't speak Spanish to impress because ""V"" will cut you off from having drinks. Additionally, if you leave a big tip at the bar and it's not for ""V"" she will throw it away like it was never there. Most importantly, if ""V"" doesn't appreciate your business she will talk about you to whomever speaks spanish.

The mozzarella sticks were good the first bite but then you knew they were not freshly made. The boneless wings were not all sauced and chewy. The Artichoke dip was bland while the nachos were salty.

And if she's a lesbian, she definitely wears the pants in the relationship. Her sexual orientation isn't a problem obviously but I need to state this so you guys know who I'm talking about. I don't think that I should have to ask my server for utensils. It should just be there when the food arrives. And please don't take your time getting me utensils so I have to eat the food when it gets cold with the utensils you were ""forced"" to get me. Asshole.  And we needed refills. I should not have to go up to the bar and ask the bartender for refills because you want to sit down THE WHOLE TIME I'M FUCKING THERE AND PLAY PATTYCAKE WITH THE OTHER WORKERS. And please do come and ask, ""how is everything?"" instead of saying, ""yo, you guys good?"". Classless. I felt sick leaving a tip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-elizabeth?start=40
Jayson G.,"Keasbey, NJ",1,8,,1.0,4/16/2014,"Went here 2 weeks ago and I've been dying to write about how much this apple b's sucks.  Sat to have dinner with some friends and the waiter girl came and basically laid the whole front half of her body over the table which was weird. And then every 5 mins she would come and do the same thing and ask if we needed something else. We ordered a berry sangria pitcher, when she brought it to the table I was like whoaa yess That's a lot but, there was only enough in the whole pitcher for 2 small wine glasses and a half!  The whole thing was filled to the top with ice creating the illusion of it being filled with the actual drink. She kept asking if we wanted more which was kinda annoying too. In all this has to be the worst apple b's and, restaurant in general I've ever been to in my life, I wish I would've read the reviews before coming.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-elizabeth?start=40
Jack W.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",13,15,1,1.0,7/21/2015,"Might be the worst bartenders I have ever experienced! Bad service, slow, nasty to customers, and just downright bad attitudes! Being part of a shopping mall and close to many hotels, one would think they would bend over backwards and welcome business in an area of New Jersey surrounded by shipping containers and industrial complexes! Not so here. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-elizabeth?start=40
Diamond Y.,"Elizabeth, NJ",37,5,1,1.0,6/16/2014,"THE WORST Applebee's experience EVER! We got here around 10:40 so it was about 10 people in there TOPS. The servers are standing near the bar dancing & talking about a beach trip tomorrow took 11 minutes until someone came & took our order. Asked my husband what he wanted didn't return the favor to me strike one. Brought him his drink took off again to clean a table without even asking if we were ready to order. We ordered a chocolate meltdown it was good, can't really mess that up BUT it took another 14 minutes to get the bill, another 5 for her to take the check then the cherry on too was not bringing us back all of our change. I will NEVER go to this Applebee's again. Ghetto Gardens.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-elizabeth?start=40
Pami G.,"Paterson, NJ",1,1,,1.0,9/26/2014,This is the worst applebees ever!!!! Never again our waitress Britney was horrible we waited 40 minutes to not even get a second drink. The whole time we were there she didnt even come to our table I had to ask another waitress for a clean fork. Yet Britney was quick to give is the check but not check on us at least once. When I did get my food it was half cold. I will never be going back to this place,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-elizabeth?start=40
LI E.,"Long Island, NY",1,9,2,1.0,3/14/2013,"I don't expect much from a chain like this, but this was a Horrible Experience!  The staff was less than friendly and hardly helpful.  They almost seemed annoyed that I was there.

Jill W.,"Honolulu, HI",10,10,4,1.0,12/15/2013,"If I could, I would give this place NEGATIVE stars. My boyfriend and I came here to give Applebee's a try since we don't have any in Hawaii. We were seated promptly. Six waitresses walked by us several times and they just looked at us and didn't ask if we needed anything. HORRIBLE customer service. We waited 20 minutes and weren't even served water so we walked out. The hostesses at the door didn't even notice us walk out. They were too busy on their phones. We walked by about 30 minutes later and the menus were still there. DON'T EVER EAT AT THIS LOCATION.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-elizabeth?start=40
Veronica L.,"North Arlington, NJ",30,33,,3.0,8/27/2013,"Update:  I went back to this location only because I got a BOGO coupon for my birthday for a free entree.  Though there were still no windows on the wall facing the inside of the mall, the waiter this time was a LOT better than the one we had the time before.  The food was fine.  My steak had a little too much pepper for my taste, but it was cooked to the correct temperature. It took a long time for my drink order to get to me from the bar, but when it did come, the manager brought it and apologized for the wait (I hadn't even asked about the drink yet!). The waiter wasn't 100% on-point, because I asked for some extra chips after finishing with the ones in the Spinach and Artichoke Dip appetizer (to finish the dip), and we didn't GET the chips until after dinner AND me asking again.  I'm pretty sure it was the waiter who forgot because after I reminded him, they came out of the kitchen within 5 minutes. Definitely a better experience than my first visit here, but I'd still opt for an Applebee's that's a little farther away that has better service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-elizabeth?start=40
Alyssa M.,"New York, NY",232,246,78,3.0,1/5/2013,"I'm not a huge fan of Applebee's to start, but relatively speaking this isn't a bad spot. It's attached to the mall so I'm sure it gets super cray around dinner/lunch time but when we came around 11pm it was empty. All of our food and drinks came out on time and everything tasted fresh. They did seat us at the back of the restaurant considering we were a pretty big party and about 7 different waiters helped us for one thing or another (I guess because we were in such an inconvenient spot?). They also only asked my boyfriend and I for ID for drinks because ""You guys look too young"", which is embarrassing when they didn't ask anyone else. However, in general, it was a pretty good experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-elizabeth?start=40
Zeh R.,"Bayonne, NJ",4,9,,1.0,5/29/2013,"We came here to eat on a Sunday night when it was decently busy. We didn't have to wait long which was a plus but our dinner ended up being over two hours due to the slow and rude service. Our waitress was less than happy to be there and acted as if we were an inconvience on her night. When I asked where our lemonades were in a polite manner, she responded by saying very harshly and an eye role saying that the bartender was still making them. Would have been nice to know during one of the three times she walked passed us. The food itself was bland and the night ended with the waitress giving us a chipper fairwell. I guess she expected a night of rudeness would be rewarded with a good tip. She also forgot to give me my debit card back and I had to go back to retrieve that which was annoying. Overall, avoid this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-elizabeth?start=40

Leslie H.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,4,2,1.0,2/26/2014,If I can I would give this place negative 0 stars! By far the worse service I've ever had in my life. Hostess was nice and quick. Our server didn't write down our order and she claimed she didn't cause she was good at her job. She didn't give us plates or napkins for our appetizer sampler. The patron margarita tasted like water. My sizzling fajita skillet was cold and not sizzling. My fried wanted fries and mashed pots with his honey chicken and shrimp and she didn't bring it out like that! Maybe if she would of wrote it down she wouldn't of forgot! She forgot my guacamole and my wraps. Kim also charged me for the guac after not recieving it! I had to eat it like that cause she took so long. She didn't bring us refills after being asked. She brought out our brownie with NO ice cream!! And no spoons. I'm a Applebee's employee but in another location and I expected better service then this !! She was very slow and forgot us and her other tables were also complaining about her. I love going out to eat but this place needs to retrain or hire new servers and cooks ASAP! Never coming here again and most definitely will let my colleagues know not to dine in such horrible atmosphere!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-elizabeth?start=40
Claudiu S.,"Fort Lee, NJ",0,6,,1.0,12/29/2013,"Awful service.
