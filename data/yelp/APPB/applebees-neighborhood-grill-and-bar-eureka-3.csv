Kris M.,"McKinleyville, CA",3,28,5,2.0,2/26/2017,"18 minutes before someone even asked us if we wanted anything to drink, another 10 minutes past that before we were asked if we were ready to order, an hour all together before food got to the table. The kids activity sheets are going to need to have a lot more activities on them if all three kids are going to stay occupied for an hour.  They complained after about 30 minutes because they were hungry, bored, and generally displeased with having to wait forever.  It was the longest meal I've ever been involved in.  This applebees experience sucked.  The food wasn't bad, (not fantastic though either) and our server (even tho she took forever) gave my daughter an ice cream because she overheard me talking to her about a birthday meal I would cook her because she didn't like the steak she ordered.  Glad she overheard me talking and was paying attention because it was the only thing that night that made my daughter smile.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-eureka-3?start=20
Charise A.,"McKinleyville, CA",8,7,2,1.0,3/10/2017,"If I could give no stars I would. I went here with my boyfriend for a late lunch. Upon walking in, I noticed the place was extremely dirty. The floor looked like it hadn't been cleaned in years, the walls and blinds were covered in gunk and dirt and even food! Eeeek! I couldn't even keep an appetite. Made me wonder what the kitchen looked like. Regardless, we ordered, our server was nice. I got a four cheese mac and he got a club sandwich. They weren't very busy but the food took way too long. Once we got it, the food wasn't warm and my mac and cheese was more like soup and tasteless. His club sandwich was so soggy he couldn't eat it and it all fell apart. I felt bad for our server so I wanted to talk to the manager but she was interviewing a prospective employee in the lobby in front of guests. We barely ate and paid the check and left. I'm horrified. I will never eat there again. If it was just a busy day and their chef was not on his game that's one thing. But as a restaurant manager myself, the cleanliness was shocking. There has to be a health code violation for this place. I've always loved Applebee's but I will never go to this location again.

We watched them wipe it down then... 10 minutes later we were allowed to sit.  Another 10 minutes, and the manager finally came to our table to take our drink and app order.  I ordered a margarita with no salt.  It came with salt.  Our server didn't show up until our appetizer and drinks were on the table.  Food came out in a timely fashion and was delivered by a very young food runner.  We ordered 2 more drinks, both of those came without salt like I originally asked.  We finished our food and drinks and waited around for our server to notice that we wanted to leave.  By the time we got our bill I was pretty annoyed and only left a 10% tip.  Idk if they give their servers too many tables or too little training, but I can pretty much guarantee terrible service and ok food if you go here.  Don't go here on a date, the shit service will kill the mood.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-eureka-3?start=20

It's not often you see a chain restaurant or any restaurant in this area where drinks are prepared to look great as well as food. And the staff was great as well. It could have been quicker but I'm sure the waitress was busy as a bee so I understand. Something that I thought was really great is that the gentleman waiting tables brought my food to my table.

Steve C.,"Auburn, WA",10,105,182,2.0,12/24/2017,"We stopped at this Applebee's location for lunch on our way north bound on Hwy 101.  The French Onion soup I started with was very good with a rich flavor. The restaurant wasn't quite full, but the food did take some time to arrive.  My better half 's Fish and Cole slaw was done beautifully, with the fish fried golden brown and tender and moist. Compared to my sirloin steak which was rather chewy with gristle. The starch on the plate which was potato tots on a bed of mash potato didn't quite work well together.   Service was minimal. Our server passed our table a few times without stopping to check to see if things were alright.  At the end of our meal, with the credit card transaction, a 20% gratuity was suggested after the total amount which we did not quite agree with the service we received.The total bill comes up on the trivia game machine on the table. You swipe your credit card into this machine and a 20% tip is calculated for you.  If this is the business practice with Applebee restaurants in place, in a way it helps encourage a slack in service practice from their employees without providing their best to customers and just take things for granted! I do believe we are done with Applebees if this is their practice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-eureka-3

Chris C.,"Imperial Beach, CA",55,18,2,2.0,1/2/2018,"I'm driving down the coast with my family and staying the night here in Eureka. I wanted slightly better than fast food but not expensive restaurant prices so I chose Applebee's. I knew what I expected to get. So I ordered food on the phone so I could pick up and go to the hotel room, sit in my pjs and relax. As we arrived we were jovially greeted by a waitress. She was quick and efficient. I sat there for about ten minutes (I showed up early so I expected to wait) and watched waitresses cycle out the door for their smoke break. Eventually we got our food, paid the fair price and drove home. Upon setting out our food to dig in and enjoy I was greeted by several surprises. My first surprise is I had not received what I ordered. I asked for a chicken club and got a chicken burger. I guess it's kinda the same right? I mean they both have chicken... and bread.... well trying to be laid back I figured it was no big deal. Then I got my Second surprise..... we got a chicken oriental salad. Apparently they thought I wanted it rare. Cause that's how they served the ""crispy chicken."" In all fairness it was crispy on the outside so they technically told the truth. But the chicken was completely raw in the middle. So all in all if you want a low priced meal in this town I would think about looking somewhere else. I added one star because, like I said, the waitresses were nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-eureka-3

We ordered takeout here and asked for extra dressing for the salad when we got inside. They said yes, walked to the back and grabbed our food and specifically said the extra dressing is in there with the salad. We should know better but we assumed we were safe, drove to our hotel only find there was no salad and, understandably at this point, no extra dressing.

We had no napkins with our appetizers. We had to ask for utensils more then once. She never removed any dirty glasses off our table just kept bringing refills in new glasses. We had to start putting empty plates and glasses behind us on another table to make room. My girlfriend said she had this same server two times before and her service was poor then.  The overall service of the whole restaurant was poor. We sat in the middle of dirty tables for the two hours we were there.

So they have definitely upped their game. The service has definitely been upgraded too. The only thing I would complain about is the soda price, come on 3 dollars?!

Kelly M.,"Eureka, CA",2,11,,1.0,4/7/2015,"I used to really like applebees. Their food was decent and affordably priced. I don't eat out often, so after a lengthy absence from visiting this applebees, I returned with my parents in tow. When I arrived, I found that the place was being remodeled and was looking rather nice. So we sat down and I went to order one of my favorite appetizers, the green bean crispers with horse radish, only to be told that they don't have horse radish anymore. Ok, ok, so I ordered the spinach and artichoke dip. We ordered drinks and a dinner each. Our dinner arrived before our appetizer, which we had to ask for because ""it was pushed off to one side and I forgot it."" Ok, so things happen. The food quality was awful. The best part of our meal was the cold appetizer. And the pricing was outrageous for the portions we received. For what we paid, we could have gone to the sea grill and been happier. Essentially, quality of food has been recently downgraded and the prices upgraded. Sorry, but I will never again be visiting this establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-eureka-3?start=40

The mojito's actually taste like a mojito instead of watered down Kool-Aid & they started carrying real beer like Total Domination (which made my fiancé very happy).  I'm not sure what they did but it's like a whole new place.  We will definitely be stopping here whenever we visit Eureka for now on.  Keep up the great service & food!  :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-eureka-3?start=40

Kay A.,"Modesto, CA",168,130,39,3.0,6/2/2011,"I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants but my sister, and my cousin and her boyfriend wanted to eat here because it's a familiar restaurant in an unfamiliar place. The first thing that we noticed is that this placed was packed. The parking lot was busy and there were many groups patronizing the restaurant. We were seated quickly but service was slow. I don't think this is intentional, I just strongly believe that everything in Eureka is a little slower than in the Bay Area which can be nice when you just want to chill and unwind at the end of the day.  What makes this place unique is the atmosphere, as in the people, which is very different from what you'd get from the Bay Area... I don't know if you can tell but I'm having a bit of a culture shock. I just moved to Humboldt County and everything is.... different.  The waitstaff and the general friendly environment made the visit worth it.

But I've stopped going for good. The service has gone severely downhill, and last time I went we ordered all our food pretty quickly... which then took an hour and ten minutes to come out. No one refilled my water, I waved two waiters down twice to simply ask how much longer they might think... and they'd say they would check and never return. When we finally got our food, our waitress (who finally appeared after an hour and a half, seriously) gave us the check right away and didn't even say thanks. And the food tasted like it had been sitting out for 20 minutes... a little dry, a little room temperature, not acceptable.

Paul S.,"Los Angeles, CA",39,50,15,1.0,5/16/2010,"Redneck central.  I sat at the bar and got just about the worst service I've ever had anywhere.  The bartender treated me like I just made off with his wife.  Won't look me in the eye, won't answer basic questions, such as ""what kind of beer is that with the XYZ tap handle?"".  Serves every step of the meal in complete silence.  I have to flag him down for everything. Yet, he turns right around and treats everybody else at the bar like they are his best friends forever.  Turns out, as I'm eating, I discover all 8 people at the bar (save for myself) are eureka applebees employees.   I've never seen such an uppety redneck with such an unbelievable chip on his shoulder for somebody who's major crime against the universe is not living in this lovely town.  Maybe someday I can move here, come in every single day, and earn mr. Mgraw's basic common courtesy as a food service professional.  Until then I will forever be the outsider made to feel uncomfortable in no uncertain terms, by lord yocal of redneckshire himself. Food - typical applebees.  Ok.  Except for the medium rare steak which came out well done.  Not worth arguing.  Have a nice life eureka applebees ""pm bartender"" who can't even wear a nametag or put your real name on the receipt.  I for one will not be back.  Hopefully your fellow employees will keep you in business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-eureka-3?start=60
