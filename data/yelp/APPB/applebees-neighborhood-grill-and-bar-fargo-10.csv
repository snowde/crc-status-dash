Christopher S.,"Fargo, ND",17,93,408,4.0,12/26/2017,"It is in the neighborhood.  Family Americana dinning. Otherwise,  there is really nothing on the menu that calls me back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fargo-10
Alissa S.,"Austin, TX",3,18,,1.0,11/15/2017,Just as terrible as I remember 10 years ago as a teenager. Mozzarella sticks were cold on the inside. Ordered steak medium rare and came out medium well. The garnish of mushrooms and onions was really just halfway cooked onions.  One good thing- service was great!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fargo-10
Josh C.,"Captiva, FL",1,24,33,5.0,5/1/2017,"Great food, great service with happy employees! Very impressed with quality of food especially being a chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fargo-10
MK L.,"Fargo, ND",11,87,347,5.0,11/11/2015,"I've been going to Applebee's for veterans day for about 5 years now and every time the thing that impressed me the most is the service.  They really go all on veterans day and that's why it's so fun. The free meal is always excellent, but I always order appetizers and soup.  The Kaysadillas were especially good today.  I also tried the chicken tortilla soup which I really liked. One of my friends got the lemon pepper chicken and said it was just fantastic.  This Applebee's is my favorite of all them. For some unknown reason it feels very comfortable there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fargo-10
Betsy M.,"Vail, AZ",71,459,527,4.0,7/3/2015,"Did a call in order from this Applebee's which was right next to my hotel.  Seemed quite busy and maybe a newer location?  The staff that helped me in the call in order area were super nice and friendly.  I had to wait for something in my order and a couple servers asked if I had been helped.  The level of service I got with just a call in order, given how busy they were gets them four stars. The food was tasty - it is a chain -- so my expectations are pretty average.  I had the BLT w/fries and ordered the green bean appetizer - both were hot/fresh and tasted good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fargo-10
Melissa E.,"Seattle, WA",36,7,5,5.0,12/27/2016,Honestly the best Applebee's I've been to. Awesome customer service and the American Burger was really good. We were in the area visiting family and picked the perfect place for a quick family dinner - everyone loved their meal.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fargo-10
Megan P.,"Fargo, ND",154,34,1,2.0,7/21/2015,"First of all I was not here by choice. I haven't been to an Applebee's in over 15 years and there is a good reason for that. This locations was slow and not that busy. Yet, our food still took forever to come out. I wish Applebee's would get on the healthy food kick and have better options. It's really lacking in my opinion. As mentioned above I will only eat here if it's not my choice. Which means maybe once every 15 years.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fargo-10
D Z.,"Fargo, ND",14,7,,4.0,5/10/2016,"My family and some friends visited this location before the Garth concert and our server, Nick, went above and beyond. Our friends joined us after we got there so we had to switch tables and the staff went out of their way to make the transition extremely easy. We all decided on several rounds of apps instead of entrees and they all were ordered and served quickly. The boneless wings portion were random (and often quite small pieces) but the craziness of the event had everyone in the restaurant running rampant--it could have been a lot worse. Thanks again, Nick!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fargo-10
Topher H.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",273,34,19,5.0,8/14/2016,"Hands down, best customer service you could ask for.  When we got there, my parents, sister's family, and brother's family all met  to have a meal together after not seeing each other all at one time for 2 months.  We try to take a group selfie outside, yes an annoying selfie, lol.  All of a sudden, the hostess comes out to take our picture for us.  The hostess then held the door for us as we entered.  Then, our server Jason was very attentive.  He also demonstrated a pleasant personality /attitude which makes or breaks a dining experience.  The food was good, timed well with the drinks and appetizers.  The restaurant was clean inside and in the outside parking area.  As we left, the hostess and manager held the door for us as we left.  Seriously, how often do you have the door held for you while you leave.  I was able to be at ease and enjoy myself because I knew my family was being treated well, like we were family of those working at the restaurant. We will be coming back here when we visit Fargo again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fargo-10
Tanya G.,"Fargo, ND",0,47,11,5.0,4/23/2016,"Great service and food was awesome. Tried the new cheeseburger wrap app, was creative and delicious. For main meal I had a chicken pasta which was so amazing. The service was friendly wish I could recall her name feel like it was kristin. My significant other ordered a blue moon and had the philly. Pretty good he would of preferred sautéed onion over fried but otherwise it was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fargo-10
Kyle Z.,"Fargo, ND",0,11,6,3.0,10/6/2014,"Meh. Obviously its an applebees, so you cant expect anything amazing, but compared to other applebees Ive been to, this one was a tiny bit worse. I got some boneless wings as an appetizer, and it seemed like they barely put any sauce on them.  Compared to other times I've gotten applebees wings, at least. Then, I got the mac and cheese with honey pepper. It was okay, but I would definitely ask for the honey pepper on the side, it was too damn sweet. Service was good, on the other hand.  Wasnt bad enough that I'll never go back, but definitely could have been better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fargo-10
Kylee D.,"Fargo, ND",0,5,,5.0,2/29/2016,"My husband & I had both ordered steak, & the cut of it was just horrible lol. What really won us over was how incredibly well the situation was handled. Our server was very quick to order something else for us & the manager on shift immediately came over to our table to express genuine concern, joked about how bad the cut of the steak was, discounted our meal & continued to be very attentive through out the rest of the time we where there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fargo-10
Pat R.,"Salem, OR",0,28,2,1.0,5/22/2015,"The staff and manager had a valid issue with my party, but handled telling us this issue poorly. This was our first impression of Fargo. Thank you kindly for your hospitality, Applebees. We'll be hand writing to corporate. Also, when the issue was handled further, the GM sent his host to deal with us instead of approaching us himself,  he then walked by afterward with a smile on his face.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fargo-10
Anja D.,"Fargo, ND",0,5,6,3.0,6/28/2014,"My in-laws took me for dinner. I had shrimp and steak. Wanted med, of course i got well done. * sigh* it is so hard to find a resturant where the service is good AND the food is too. Waiter was frindly. Please use cleaner rags to clean the tables. It smelled like the rag had been sitting for days growing bacteria. Also, please clean your bathroons better.  I really like that my doors where held open by the staff",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fargo-10
Angie M.,"Fargo, ND",320,79,76,4.0,1/10/2014,Wednesday night is wine night! $10 bottles on house wines. Great deal! Throw in some of their wings and I am a happy girl!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fargo-10
Tricia K.,"Fargo, ND",2,26,12,2.0,10/28/2012,Not a huge fan of Applebee's but it is a decent enough place to bring the family for a reasonably priced sit-down meal. One of my biggest jokes about Applebee's with my Hubs is that you can have your food in 25min but you will wait 30min for the bill. At least that's what it can seem like.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fargo-10
J M.,"Idaho Falls, ID",0,17,,2.0,2/3/2013,"Came in on a Saturday night with a friend for coffee and dessert.  Restaurant was reasonably full with college crowd.  Waiter appeared promptly and took our order. The coffee and desserts were delivered fairly quickly, too.   I had an unexceptional scoop of ice cream - a little icy from being thawed slightly and refrozen. My friend's chocolate brownie was a huge hit - she said it was more cake than brownie.  It disappeared quickly, though! Then it was if we didn't exist any more.  It took at least 10 minutes to flag down our waiter to ask for a refill on coffee - way too long given the smallish mugs - and nearly 15 minutes after that for him to arrive with the pot, by which time we were more than ready to go. Fortunately I'd given him my credit card when we ordered the refills, so we didn't get delayed further. It didn't seem like the place was understaffed - just absent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fargo-10
Darryl R.,"New York, NY",0,351,12,3.0,10/7/2011,"Decent, solid restaurant. I had the NY strip steak which was flavorful and tender.  An excellent choice to walk to from the Homewood Suites.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fargo-10
James P.,"Grand Forks, ND",0,13,,2.0,1/5/2014,By far the most awkward experience at a restaurant ever...  Not to mention the server basically called my female friend fat... This experience was more awkward than your freshmen year high school Homecoming dance when mom and dad won't stop taking pictures and are driving you and your date (that you will probably never get with them) to and from dinner and the dance.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fargo-10
