Patricia C.,"Port Washington, NY",1,29,,4.0,3/19/2012,"Stopped at this restaurant on a trip home from the Pocono's to Long Island.  Needed a place to eat that was going to be not an adventure.  Also wanted fast off the highway and quick on.  This Applebee's was perfect.  The menu was extensive, the food was good and the prices were very good.  We had the 2 for $20 deal and actually took food home.  The staff were attentive and quick to serve.  My steak was not quite to my cooked liking and they took it back and fixed it to be perfect, no problem. My only one complaint would be the ladies room was a bit disgusting.  But to be honest you cannot really fault the restaurant for the slobs that use the rest rooms.  But they need to pay better attention to cleaning them more often. All in all on my trips using route 80 I will definitely eat here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flanders-3?start=20

Mike R.,"Long Valley, NJ",3,90,9,1.0,2/22/2011,"We usually don't eat at this location because of the poor service we've had in the past.  We made the mistake, though, of trying again last week.  The service was poor.  It started with a less then welcoming welcome by the hostesess.  We had seven people and wanted to sit four and three since it was my daughter's birthday and she wanted to sit ""alone"" with her friends.  The hostess obviously didn't want to do that and made it pretty apparent.  She offered to sit us at a booth for six and put a chair in the aisle.  She finally decided that she could accommodate us, but made sure we knew she was doing US a favor. When we sat down, we waited 45 minutes until we got anything to eat.  We ordered salad and an appetizer - that's what took 45 minutes to come out.   While we waited for our meals, several ""runners"" came by out table to ask us if the food they had was ours.  Really?   When the food finally came out, it wasn't very good. I understand that I'm eating at a chain and I don't expect fine dining at Applebees.  We do eat at Applebees because we have kids and everyone can find something they like.  I don't dislike the chain. This location, however, is the pits.  I should have followed my instincts, but we were all really hungry and this was the closest place. The Hackettstown Applebees isn't far away, about 10 or 15 minutes.  I've always had a good experience there - better food and much better service.  If you are going to eat at Applebees, do yourself a favor, don't go to the Mount Olive location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flanders-3?start=20
Robert B.,"Hackettstown, NJ",44,40,2,1.0,1/27/2010,"The chain bills itself as your ""Neighborhood Grill and Bar"" but shouldn't a place committed to a community worry about customer service?  The service and food are so inconsistent it's almost funny.  We never knew what were going to get & the cost doesn't make up for being served the wrong food, still frozen food or burned food.  Adding insult to injury is being made to wait over an hour for the kids chicken fingers!  We could have gone to MickyD's down any street, brought the bag back and eaten at the table.  We have had our meals comped for their mistakes but how many times does it take to get the formula right?  I'm tired of hit or miss service and lousy food and will never set foot in one again.    This review applies to the chain.  We have eaten in Hackettstown, Mt. Olive, Newton, Parsippany etc...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flanders-3?start=20
mrt y.,"Morristown, NJ",0,57,10,1.0,6/4/2011,"Went again for All you can eat Salad/Soup/Breadsticks. Soup is good but service was so bad, It took 20min for first serve and then had to wait another 20 min wait to refill soup.  House salad came with Bacon first time and Bacon disappeared in second serving.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flanders-3?start=20

Gabriel D.,"Middlesex, NJ",1,69,112,5.0,7/30/2017,"Stopped here for a quick lunch on the way back from PA. Soups were great, as well as both entrees we had.

Morton F.,"New Castle, DE",83,922,3709,3.0,10/29/2017,"We were a group of eight on Saturday evening. The wait was very long (well over half an hour) but I think the problem was they only had one table set up for a group of eight, so another group had to finish their meal first before we could get it. When we did get that table, the other problem we noticed is the table had an enormous centerpiece, with condiments and cards, that we could not remove. It was like a wall dividing us into two groups of four. Service was reasonably efficient and accommodating. Our server readily agreed to split the bill, which was great since our orders were all very different. I had the crispy brewhouse chicken. The flavor was great. The texture was indeed crispy despite liberal application of sauce. However, the portion size seemed on the small side for what the entree cost. For dessert, I had a brownie bite. Perhaps the brightest spot of the meal, it was a nice small dessert at a reasonable price. Overall, I'm reminded why I rarely go to Applebee's. It's both good and bad, but never outstanding. It's a straight down the middle sit-down restaurant chain experience that I'm usually not inclined to pay an above average price for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flanders-3
Tom W.,"Succasunna, NJ",30,18,,4.0,3/27/2017,Went there to meet a friend for Drinks on a Friday night. Bar was busy but not over crowded.  Service was prompt.  TV's had all the games on.

Pasquale R.,"Madison, NJ",1730,1527,245,2.0,2/26/2016,"I cannot believe I actually went this Applebee's. We were in the area, we were meeting people and it turns out everywhere we decided on, there was a minimum of 30-45 min wait...bummer. So we were left with this place. 20 minute wait.  The food here is gross. Now, I do like my chains every once in a while but this place is terrible.  Let me back up. The only edible food was the app - pretzels and beer cheese dip.  I had a chicken wrap thing that I took two bites and just ate the fries...oh and they were decent. The chicken was fake...I mean like Panera bad... Their margarita's are so sweet (not in a good way)...and so many ice cubes...blah!  Why 2 stars? The pretzels and service.  I wouldn't go back... Avoid if you can...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flanders-3
Anil D.,"Pittstown, NJ",1,9,2,5.0,7/31/2016,"We just had diner at Applebee's in Mount Olive, NJ. We had the best experience there being vegetarian.

Amy H.,"Flanders, NJ",66,198,95,4.0,6/15/2015,"Applebee's - this is the place my kids always beg to go to.  Why? they absolutely love their kids meal selections.  You can get Mac and Cheese, big kid mac and cheese with breadcrumbs and chicken!  French Bread Pizza, chicken tenders, Chicken grillers etc.  The part they love is the yogurt with apples and the apple sauce go go squeezes.  Great great sides for kids.  It also keeps them away from the french fries - when we are here they don't even ask for them! For the adults, they have an ever changing menu. We tried the new shrimp appetizer - it was very good.  Lightly tempura battered with a light spicy sauce.  Very good.   My husband had his 'ol faithful' - Chicken Fajita Rollup and i had what was the old Tequila Lime Chicken - but aye they are family friendly so now we call it the Fajita Chicken :)  Yummy to say the least.   Service was good - she wasn't the most talkative server and didn't make any recommendations. She was on top of the refills of drinks and did let my children order which sometimes servers do not like.  Overall, i would recommend this Applebee's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flanders-3
Jeff R.,"Selden, NY",0,17,,4.0,3/7/2017,Sat at the bar. Bartender Tim is great. He's a master at his craft.  Craft beer selection is small but very good selections. Food is normal Applebee food. Not bad.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flanders-3

Mark R.,"Flanders, NJ",0,1,,5.0,6/7/2016,Love this applebees I guess you would have to call me a regular there since I go once a week I know the bartender manager and most of the servers by name. The environment is amazing the staff makes it fun and where else can you drink and eat for 2 people for around 36-40 and have such a great time. If ever in the area I recommend stopping in especially if tim is on bar.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flanders-3
Brian D.,"Laramie, WY",16,16,1,1.0,4/9/2016,Had a bartender Tim that was rude. I couldn't believe the service. We were enjoying our night.

Jillian G.,"North Kingstown, RI",3,29,,2.0,7/13/2011,"We enjoy going here for the late night menu and usually have great service while sitting at the bar.  I also, always feel welcomed by the hosts, they are right there to greet you and open the door, which I think is a great way to start and end your experience in a restaurant. The other night we came in for dinner and sat at a table and had awful service. My boyfriend and I both have working the food industry and are generally pretty understanding, however, the server we had was very unattentive and it wasn't busy at all. She did not bring us a single item. We waited almost 10 minutes to be greeted, when she did come over we gave her our entire order and thats the last we saw of her until AFTER our food came out. We had drinks from the bar, waters, appetizer and entrees brought out by different people. When she ""checked in"" after we had gotten our food, we asked for extra napkins and never got them.  I am truely dissappointed because we do enjoy going to this location because it's close to our house. We will most likely continue to visit for the late night menu but will not sit in the dining area any more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flanders-3
Daniel L.,"Budd Lake, NJ",0,11,8,3.0,9/26/2012,"We eat at this Applebee's location frequently.  I have had a pretty good experience and find they are very accommodating to parties with small children (we have 2 year old twins)  The servers generally ask if we would like the children's meals with the appetizers or with the meals.  In addition to the server, we usually find that a manager is also checking if things are good with each tables.  Many times we also use the car side to go service and find the meals ready on time and well packed.  We have not experienced the poor service others have noted.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flanders-3
