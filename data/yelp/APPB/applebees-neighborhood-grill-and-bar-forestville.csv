Benita A.,"Washington, DC",170,3,,1.0,7/29/2016,Terrible service. Server David have no experience at customer service. Maybe he assumed I was young or something because he barely serviced our table. The drinks were waterdown and at the end of the 20 mins I was there eating the appetizer I left to go to another restaurant.

Damon C.,"Philadelphia, PA",17,9,3,1.0,5/30/2016,An Applebee's with active armed police officers. This place was like Club Applebee's from the hood. We came in from out of town and we were quite frankly shell shocked with what we saw. I attempted to get a drink while the rest of my party waited for a table and no one behind the bar would make eye contact. We just left.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-forestville?start=20
Taheerah B.,"New Orleans, LA",388,436,145,4.0,4/15/2014,"I'm not an Applebee's fan, but I must admit, I haven't had this much fun on a Tuesday night since I was in undergrad.  My sister wanted to meet for dinner at Applebee's. Why would anyone want to eat at Applebee's when there are so many other choices in the DMV? I was annoyed when I got here, and it was packed. You mean to tell me that I have to wait 30 minutes for a table?!?! at Applebee's?!?! At this point, I was too hungry to leave. The wait wasn't as long as I expected because the people watching was the best.  Once seated, a dj was setting up. The music was loud, and the crowd was live. The server and hostesses were so upbeat. They looked like they truly enjoyed their jobs.  It was karaoke Tuesday! No wonder this place was live. The brave souls sang their hearts out. There were times were a popular song was on and the patrons danced in their seats. For dinner, I ordered a cheese sandwich and tomato soup. The sandwich tasted like a cheese pizza, but the soup was great. I was impressed with the quality. To drink, I had a mango margarita. I am convinced that the bartender forgot to put the mango flavoring in my cup. That was the strongest margarita I EVER had, and it was at Applebee's. I WILL be back :-)  Overall, I had so much fun there. It was more like club Applebee's. It was relaxing to laugh and have great conversations with complete strangers. The vibe was great. True, franchise restaurants are usually a solid 3- stars, but this Applebee's was a step above. I felt like I was a Deep South family reunion--- good food, strong drinks, awesome music, and great people!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-forestville?start=20
Passion C.,"District Heights, MD",279,192,83,3.0,5/3/2013,"This Applebee's has been here for years and I have had years worth of experiences eating here, both good and bad. So I settled on 3 stars. A-OK fits this place pretty well. Mostly, experiences depend on what time of day you come, what you order, and who your server is. Friday and Saturday nights, for example, tend to be packed houses with people waiting in lines out the door. The crowd is usually grown & hungry and less family friendly. And Applebee's has a pretty decent bar and cheap eats so it can turn into more of a hang out spot on the weekends. Some will try to leave here and opt for the Friday's up the street, which is just if not more crowded than here. If Applebee's isn't worth the potential long waits and big crowds, then opt for daytime hours. During the day, this place is completely chill. The last 3x I came here my servers  have all been pleasant and my food came out perfectly. I actually decided to jump out there and order a steak on the new 550 calories and under menu. If you're like me, you're probably skeptical of an Applebee's steak. But the price and calories were right so I took a chance. And it paid off. Applebee's managed to cook an absolutely perfect steak. Now I can't stop ordering that meal when I come. I've also recently had that new apple cinnamon dessert thing they have. I think it's like a dessert spring roll. DELICIOUS!!! I've been thoroughly and pleasantly surprised with the recent menu changes.  Pretty good taste bud bang for the buck.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-forestville?start=20
Koren M.,"Wixom, MI",0,35,3,5.0,12/12/2014,"I was in this area and wanted to just sit somewhere and get some me time. To my surprise they were setting up for Karoake night. It was a different experience for me because it had a party type of feel. It was refreshing for me being African American and not many places to hang out at a fun affordable price in the DMV area. It may seem a bit bizarre for someone outside being familiar with our culture but it is a breath of fresh air. I invited my best friend the next week and she felt right at home. We are both from Michigan.  P. S Our drinks and food was great. She ordered a pasta,  I had shrimp. We kept it simple because we usually don't go to chain restaurants.  p.s.s There is police present, which is not the norm for  Apple bees but neither is the type of night they have. It is appreciated unfortunately this is the world we live in (wish it wasn't necessary but they know more then I know about the area and safety first before politics) ...

Kelly M.,"Renton, WA",10,36,4,2.0,9/23/2010,"Food was average, servers were friendly and the building was reasonably clean for ahving been open for two hours. The service was just terribly slow.  Even something as simple as getting a refill was painful.  It was as if the staff just didn't possess the mental capacity to run a restaurant.  Being a good customer, I did help them out... I drank my drink extremely slow and stretched it thru the entire meal, I gave my credit card without the bill to save her the trip and I didn't order desert.   There was one thing I caught on the way out--I think I know what the core of their problems are, the catalyst of their tanked morale, the lowest common denominator of the entire organization... they haven't selected an employee of the month since Feb 2010... I bet that one lonely worker who spent her entire life trying to be somebody in the world of Applebees and getting shot down month after month is probably pretty pissed off! :S",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-forestville?start=20

Jonathan S.,"Suitland, MD",66,8,2,1.0,9/27/2011,"Before I start I would like to add that my first job was in a restaurant and I have a soft spot/understanding for what it's like. I always tip 20% and for great service I tip more.... I ate there the other night with wife and friend. The place wasn't busy (about 10 tables open). We were told it would be about 5-7min wait to be seated, which was fine, we weren't in any hurry and the empty tables were probably just from being short staffed. After waiting 12 minutes we were approached by the manager but we told him we were fine and we think we are being helped. After a few more minutes we were finally shown a table, but that was after the greeter forgot about us and sat another party that walked in after us (with 3 people just like my party). Whatever... that person must not be the brightest. We sit down and then I notice that another 7 or so minutes have passed and we haven't even met our server. The manager comes again but doesn't fix anything. Just says oh ok and walks off in another direction. Our server finally comes, introduces herself, apologizes for the wait and then walks away.... wtf, can I get a drink? 5 minutes later (yes at this point I'm looking at my watch) she takes our drink order. After another 7ish minutes I get my beer. Did I mention they aren't busy? I've been at this place for about 30 minutes and haven't even got a drink. SMDH! She comes back with our drinks and takes our order. I help her out and order apps and our meal so she didn't have to come back until the food was ready. The food came out at a quick pace... Except we got half our apps and didn't get the other half until 5 minutes later. Last time I checked we are supposed to get it at the same time. Maybe that only applied when I worked in the food industry. Good thing we were hungry because we only had a few minutes to eat our apps before our meal was brought to us. Which tells me our server was sitting on her ass while our apps sat on a counter in the kitchen. Food was fine. Everything tasted great. But if that place wasn't called Applebee's it would have went out of business a LONG time ago. I will NEVER go back and support that place until they get new management. It is obvious the staff doesn't care about their job or the name they represent and that is a direct reflection of the management.

Mark M.,"Hayward, CA",42,10,,1.0,8/16/2017,"This place is horrible. Now there are a lot of good story tellers in the world but no one could make this up. I was in town visiting my mom. We decided to go to Applebee's because my past experiences have been decent. Not sure if this chain is franchise owned but this place is the pits. We were seated rapidly. The waitress showed up 20 minutes later but the place was not crowded. She took our orders. My mother ordered a bowl of soup. I ordered a cheeseburger and fries.  The waitress took our order and returned with two forks and two napkins. One of the forks was dirty. Figuring she did not realize my mom had ordered soup, I merely pointed out that one of the forks was dirty thinking should would return with a full complement of silverware as eating soup requires a spoon. Once again she returned with two forks and no spoons or knives.  It took nearly another 40 minutes to deliver our meals and when she returned with my cheeseburger there was no mayo, and no mustard on the table or in cups on the side. I had to go to another table to grab the ketchup.  So, I called her back to the table again and asked for mayo and mustard. By now my food is starting to get cold. I only maintained my composure because my mother was present.  Once done we were presented with the bill. There were extra charges for bacon which I did not order for the burger or receive and a charge for some game that sits on the table that we did not play. We disputed the bill. That process too another 20 minutes to be corrected.  Completely tacky. I have been in some of the best burger dives in this country. This is a chain of restaurants not a stand alone burger place. I expect some sort of professionalism. They surely have to be disregarding Applebee's corporate standards.  I saw other disgruntled customers on the way out. It took all I had in me to not tell them to run for the exit! This place sucks!  #neveragain",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-forestville
Diego P.,"Washington, DC",71,2,1,1.0,2/21/2017,This is the fourth time I come to this applebee's. I will write a few points this place needs to improve on and hopefully the manager replies to this. 1) We waiting between 5 to 10 minutes to be greeted by a server and my girlfriend and I came in when it was not busy. 2) Drinks took a really long time to be dropped off at the table.  3) food comes out cold from appetizers to entrees.  4) When I'm done with appetizers please remove the plates. Not sure if the servers are trained to do this.  5) I am eating my entrees while the dirty plates from my appetizers are still on the table.  6) I don't even get a water refill. 7) my table was visited only once. 8) dirty plates attract the flies to come in to my table and this is really bad because now I no longer feel like visiting this place of his disgusting this is. 9) Please have servers to check on your tables more often.  10) Retrain all staff.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-forestville

Luckily we found a table around the bar area. FYI Saturday nights are extremely busy so come here early if you want to grab a table or booth in the bar area.  We ordered 2 long islands, 2 margaritas, 4 lemon drop shots and a sweet tea for the designated driver.. I love, love, love lemon drop martinis and shots. The shots was only $3!!  The bartender put them in a martini glass which was awesome and gave you more than just a regular shot. I totally forgot to take a picture of the lemon drop.

He grabs the cup and says ""this is something from the bar, it's not even a bug"" I respond tactfully and let him know that it looks like a bug so it is a bug....he then brushes my concern off and hastily asks what he would like me to do.....i said I need to be compensated $10 off the entire bill ....(being the understanding person that I am) that's all I wanted.... So while he's doing absolutely nothing for 10 minutes ....its hitting me that the manager of a resturaunt just basically tried to insult my intelligence by telling me that its wasn't a bug. So he arrives back at our table about 10 minutes later and says something about he was unable to give me refund bc I already ""cashed out""..so upset I respond and calmly but stern and ask why he tried to tell me that wasn't a bug in my ice. He responds and says ""yeah when I looked at it at first It didn't look like one but I went to the back and looked at it....i seen that it was a bug""...i respond and say yeah duh because it had legs right....!!!... He proceeded to offer me food credits or free drinks and I denied because I don't want anything else with legs I it......ok so Already long story short....i raised hell until the nonchalant, ignorant, unqualified idiot of a ""manager"" introduced   his general manager...Enrique ....
