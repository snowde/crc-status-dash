Autumn H.,"Mooresville, IN",3,12,,3.0,11/13/2017,Not broke bad for being there on veterans. Food was not amazing but not bad and the staff were fairly nice place could have been cleaner but since it was so busy I understand why it wasn't the best.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-franklin-5
Sharri O.,"Franklin, IN",210,61,139,1.0,10/29/2017,I like coming here frequently because the food is simple and the menu has many options. Everything is always cooked perfectly at this location and I have never had any issues. The service is slacking a little though. Today the manager brought out our appetizer and my daughters salad and I guess I'm supposed to eat off the table. Attention to detail is lacking and they kiosk at our table is absolutely filthy so I placed it on the floor. ---update... I ended up with the worst pink eye and now I'll never come back. Sanitizing your tables including the kiosk on the table would have prevented me from getting conjunctivitis. No level of hand washing could combat the amount of filth that was on that kiosk.

Deb R.,"Greenwood, IN",23,246,28,2.0,3/8/2017,"I don't get to Franklin very often, so I was in the area recently and decided to go to Applebee's. Unfortunately our experience was mediocre to below par at best.  The decor and the service was unimpressive and lackluster.  The cleanliness of the main dining area seemed OK, although when we got to our table it was still dirty so she had to come back quickly and clean it off. The place was not busy at all, but yet our waitress was very slow and not very motivated/sharp. My guests seemed to like their meals that consisted of a huge burger and grilled steak/shrimp.   I had the macaroni and cheese and sweet/spicy breaded chicken tenders platter.  It really wasn't any good. The macaroni and cheese lacked flavor and tasted off. It wasn't very cheesy at all. The chicken tenders were breaded and deep-fried to the point of oblivion (died up and petrified looking) and there was hardly any chicken on them as a result.   I should've played it safe and just ordered something else on the menu that was probably a more standard middle of the road meal.   We had the spinach and artichoke dip at the beginning of the meal. They hardly give you any dip in a tiny cup.  It was also cold. I sent it back, and our waitress brought out a new one which appeared to be right out of the oven. The tortilla chips they served with it were extremely greasy.  My salad was passable with honey mustard dressing, and my son seemed to enjoy his mozarella cheese sticks.  The overall experience was average to below average,.... which means I probably won't be back,  and it's probably off 'the list'.  Next time, I guess I'll just make the trip back up farther north and go to somewhere (comparable) like Friday's instead.  Their quality and consistency seems a little more regulated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-franklin-5
Mike A.,"Navarre, FL",1,20,2,2.0,1/16/2016,Never try to pickup a to go order at this location. Unless you are very young and have no life.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-franklin-5
Kimberly U.,"Cincinnati, OH",54,30,9,2.0,9/16/2015,"The food was mediocre, and I had to send back under-done chicken. The service was friendly enough.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-franklin-5
Erin C.,"Franklin, IN",108,159,26,2.0,1/9/2014,"Staff here is super friendly and it's always extra clean. My only beef is that Applebees did away with the veggie burger a few years ago. It is not a vegetarian friendly restaurant! They don't even offer a full size salad without meat! If you order their chicken salad and get it without the chicken they will still charge you for the full price of the salad. Which is why to be honest I almost always go to Chilis (they have a veggie burger and veggie fajitas). In all fairness though if you know at least one of the cooks in the back you can probably get something ""off the menu"" aka pasta with no meat or a salad (that's about it). They've accomadated me a few times, but I always feel like I'm giving them a hassle in the kitchen. Basically the only part that's really good is the half off appetizers late at night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-franklin-5
Courtney T.,"Greenwood, IN",181,259,104,3.0,7/14/2012,"What can I say. I""ve been coming here for years. I know most of the wait and bar staff by first name.  It's a good place to go if you aren't sure what you want. They however should bring back the chicken fajitas to the menu. Staff is awesome",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-franklin-5
Jw J.,"Shelbyville, IN",136,16,24,4.0,8/17/2015,Got there right at open everyone was so nice and took great care of us. Ordered the 2 for $25 deal not bad for a lunch date with my beautiful wife. Good food great service better company.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-franklin-5
Ian B.,"Indianapolis, IN",247,271,806,4.0,8/5/2013,"Its Applebee's so you know what your going to get. But I have been in some Applebee's where the food was horrible and the service stunk worse. This one on the other hand is consistent. The food is good and the service is great. My father and uncle bring our 92 year old great uncle here on Sunday's (used to take him to the Willard and he had 1 bad hamburger and said no more) so in searching for a new Sunday restaurant to take him we have found that for a well rounded menu, moderately priced and great staff this is our new place. My uncle (not the 92 yr old) took about 5 minutes ""literally"" with our waitress standing there explaining things over and over to order a beer. She was so patient and tried as best she could and even put up with his frustrations. So yeh good place to go!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-franklin-5
Gretchen S.,"Indianapolis, IN",185,58,2,5.0,11/11/2014,"Just had a really great lunch here with excellent service! I ordered the 7 oz sirloin, mashed potatoes and broccoli. The steak was cooked perfectly, which almost never happens when I go out, and the mashed potatoes (with skin) were fantastic! Even the broccoli was good. The waitress was attentive without being intrusive and never missed a beat. Good job!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-franklin-5
Chris B.,"Franklin, IN",35,118,60,4.0,10/22/2012,"Smug sense would tell you this is a chain and supporting a place like this big time would be comical. However, beyond the decent food, the staff here at this particular local are awesome. Me and a ton of friends from my church tend to dominate half price apps here on the regular with up to 20 people at a time joining. The staff are always super accommodating, we even know many of their names now and they are always incredibly pleasant. Makes for a great environment and I would highly suggest this Applebee's chain station or not. Much love Applebee's",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-franklin-5
Bob C.,"Franklin, IN",0,33,2,4.0,9/22/2014,"The survey is impossible! I still want my $1000. Why would a survey with a confirmation number possibly need me to fill in basic info like price, times, and dates? The number should cross reference with this data! Annoying surveys usually mean they are purposely restricting feedback!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-franklin-5
