Dyann H.,"Gaylord, MI",0,4,,5.0,12/5/2017,"I don't know why so few stars for this location . Prices are reasonable. Great variety of healthy and not so healthy choices. Service is almost always top notch.  Been here 20-30 times in the last couple of years and food is always delicious... well except fries... hate their fries...,glad I don't eat them usually . I usually get salmon, Caesar salad, soups, burger, or a couple different chicken dinners. These are always good.  And have only had bad service once. If ' Alex' is working, she is an outstanding server",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gaylord-3
Joe T.,"Sault Ste. Marie, MI",6,12,1,1.0,11/2/2017,Walked out. Me and the wife sat at the table for 15 min and never got any service. Went to Buffalo wild wings and were waited in immediately.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gaylord-3
Justin H.,"Mason, MI",0,25,51,1.0,7/15/2017,"It had been a while since I had been to an Applebee's and I will be honest that I was not expecting much from this chain, and it is a good thing I wasn't. Not a fan.  I stopped in on Easter because it was one of the only places open.  My waitress was tending bar and clearly did not want to be there.  She was actually having her meal at the table beside me.   The food was meh.  I tried on of their Specials, a chicken dish.  It was not good.  The chicken was rubbery and bland.  It really let a lot to be desired.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gaylord-3
Henry H.,"Gaylord, MI",0,3,2,2.0,2/24/2017,Absolutely nothing for Vegetarians! Not even a black bean burger... But the employees were very nice people so they get 2 stars for trying.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gaylord-3
Jim O.,"Sterling Heights, MI",137,663,,4.0,6/24/2015,"1st. Trip to any Applebee's in a very long time. Shared two Mexican appetizers, which were 1/2 off. Both were quite good. Portions the size of a regular dinner. Service was good also.filled the stomach before a trip to mackinaw .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gaylord-3
Jim S.,"Grand Rapids, MI",0,12,,1.0,6/15/2016,Stopped for a quick lunch but it turned out be a very long lunch. 45 minutes from order to food coming out. Standard hamburger and soup/salad!  Taste was fine but a comment to the manager who asked how everything was got no reply. Find an alternative if you don't have a lot of time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gaylord-3
James C.,"Belmont, MI",1,19,28,1.0,7/6/2015,Not very cool Applebee's.  Sit down with my family (3 young children) and Foo Fighters is playing over the music system dropping f-bombs left and right.  Live concert.  Finally got that cleared up and then the food took forever.   Very poor.  Waitress was nice.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gaylord-3
Mona S.,"Howell, MI",0,40,9,1.0,8/8/2014,Worst Applebee's I have ever seen!!! The floors were full of grease and slippery. Napa chicken was awful and nothing like I have had at other Applebee's. The place had a weird atmosphere. The road is very busy,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gaylord-3
Christy B.,"Birch Run, MI",20,3,5,3.0,10/8/2014,Ate at the bar and the server was nice and efficient. My meal wasn't played well and the garlic was laid on thick but over all it was pretty good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gaylord-3
Justin K.,"Gaylord, MI",12,3,,1.0,2/24/2014,Worked hear ended up walking out because  seafood cross contamination told management and they did nothing. They are mixing to much raw product in a drawer that is constantly overfilled and rarely cleaned need to hire cooks who acutely care about the safety of people's food I would give no stars but I have to to post this,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gaylord-3
Chelsea C.,"Gaylord, MI",0,9,,1.0,1/18/2012,"I got the most awful food poisoning of my ENTIRE life from this place. Dont get the shrimp wraps, or anything with shrimp. OMG it was awful. Worst expierence of my life...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gaylord-3
Dennis E.,"Livonia, MI",0,3,,2.0,10/25/2013,"Food was mediocre, service was below average.  We have given it two chances, we won't eat there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gaylord-3
