Harry N.,"Gaithersburg, MD",6,2,,3.0,11/25/2017,"I went to Applebee's with my sister on last Friday before Thanksgiving day to celebrate my birthday. When we walked into the restaurant, a staff greeted and opened the door for us. We didn't have to wait long to get seated, and we sat in one of the tables near the windows. After that, a server named Kevin (if I remembered correctly) handed us the menu and asked what drink we would like to order in the meantime. I had my Dew Berry Burst, while my sister picked her flavored lemonade. Then, the server took our order and left so we could take a look at the menu. What a great and diverse options it has!!! So many dishes, combos, entrees for us to choose from. We decided to go for the 2 for $25 option with boneless chicken wing being appetizer, 6 oz USDA Choice Top Sirloin for me (with medium rare steak plus fries as a side), and Bourbon Street Chicken+Shrimp dish. While waiting, we looked around the restaurant. Because we came in at 12:00 or 1:00 p.m., the restaurant was not so crowded at that time. But, it got great and cozy atmosphere when the weather was freezing cold outside. Few minutes later, our foods came out. My sister's dish was sizzling hot and smelled delicious, but my steak dish was not. The sauce instead of putting on top of my steak was sloppy on the side of it, making the plate looked messy. What made me so disappointed was that I told my server to have my steak medium rare; yet, when I cut the steak in half, I got little to no rare at all. I cannot understand how one cannot distinguish medium rare from well done, but sadly they cooked my steak wrong this time. To make up for their mistake, I got loads of fries on my dish. The steak on the other hand was juicy and flavorful. I also tried my sister's chicken+shrimp, and I think it was awesome except the onion. They got too salty. During our meal, our server came and checked if everything was good. Also, he asked us if we would like to have some desserts after we finished. We both shared Triple Chocolate Meltdown because I could not finish it by myself. I particularly like the chocolate oozing out from the cake when slicing it. In short, we were quite satisfied with Applebee's and will be likely return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-germantown-2
Jasmine G.,"Gaithersburg, MD",297,92,318,3.0,10/17/2017,"This location might be going the same route bob Evans went. (closed)  First off: parking was easy to find. The is plenty of seating. They have this tablet where your kids can play on it but they charge you $1.99 to use it. You can pay your meal from that device as well. Customer service: My server was super slow. I had to keep asking the host to get correct my order. And he rarely came to check on the table. Mind you, we went around 3:00pm. The restaurant was almost  dead ghost town.  Food: My plate was half way poor. Their potato's and fries  came out hard!! Lol like I could have chipped a tooth! Lol My kids burgers? The bread was hard and brown. I didn't even know till I cut the burger in half and my kid just ate it not to complain. They did give me a replacement and that took awhile too. The ribs?! Were good! I should have ordered that instead. My husband and Mom really enjoyed their plate. So it's 50:50. They need to get their service together though",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-germantown-2
Justin J.,"Clarksburg, MD",400,26,42,3.0,10/7/2017,"Came into Applebee's to watch some college football games, appetisers, and of course THE DOLLAR MARGARITAS. However, when we ordered our drinks, our waiter informed us that it could take 5-40 mins to receive our margs because everyone was ordering them. However; we got our drinks within 10 minutes so we didn't have any problems. Also you can order only 3 per hour apparently so keep that in mind when you're thinking about coming here and getting 5 the moment you sit down. The margaritas were average and they could have definitely put more tequila in them but hey, they're a dollar i'm not complaining. We got the appetizer sampler with boneless wings, chicken quesadilla, and pretzel bites. Pretzel bites were pretty good, but the cheese sauce was kinda play-dohy haha. Chicken quesadilla was good but came out a little watery/greasy but nonetheless was good. Bones less wings were just boneless wings. hard to screw up on them ya know?  Overall, it was a pretty good experience food was decent, drinks came out in an orderly fashion. HOWEVER, The drinks were a little watered down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-germantown-2

Hibah S.,"Germantown, MD",124,160,125,1.0,12/24/2017,"Absolutely awful. This Applebee's already did not have a good rep in my book as I associated it with poorly cooked steaks and watered down drinks. But now it's officially a one-star place due to service. Last night, I came here for dinner. My boyfriend and I stood by the door for several minutes, during which time absolutely no one acknowledged or greeted us. There were two employees talking to each other literally right in front of us. They were loud, so I got their names - Carla and Jordan. They continued talking for a long time while we stood by the door. Other parties were also waiting for their acknowledgment. I understand if you need to talk to each other about something, but don't waste the time of your guests. Greet and seat them first - or if there's a wait time, let them know! Or if you're conversation is truly that important, apologize and say you'll be with them in a moment or get someone else to be the host. Don't straight up ignore people. After several minutes of being ignored, we decided to leave. We couldn't believe the kind of service that was so bad we walked out before even being seated. That has never happened before.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-germantown-2
Xiomara C.,"Gaithersburg, MD",29,15,7,1.0,12/12/2017,"I will never go back to this Applebee's and maybe no other Applebee's considering how my issue has been handle. We went out to eat Saturday night and ordered our drinks, and when the drinks came out ordered our food. As my son took a sip out of his he said it tasted weird and moved it away. I looked over to see if they had given him the wrong drink and when I looked I saw a roach YES A ROACH!!!! inside the drink. We flagged our waitress and she quickly called the manager on duty, the lady apologized and asked if we wanted to stay LIKE NO but I told her I wanted a report cause if my son got sick they would have to be responsible. I filled out the report and the same night I email customer service and yet now Tuesday 11pm I have not heard from nobody.

Joy D.,"Damascus, MD",130,38,,2.0,12/23/2017,"The service was just ... BAD. From the beginning we tried to speak with the hostess about seating options, she barely greeted us and then stopped speaking to us mid conversation to have a very lengthy conversation with one of the other staff members. We were seated in a booth in the corner and had to flag down another server to find our own. Our own server didn't know any of the drink or food specials and was genuinely surprised when we read them off of the menu to him. He was pretty good at first, but throughout the course of the night it became harder and harder to find him. Once again we had to flag multiple people down to find our server. I'm sure they are super busy due to the $1 Long Island specials but sheesh! Just because I like a good deal doesn't mean I like bad service. We tried to order appetizers throughout the night as well and they were out of half of the items and some of our orders never came in. I'd say only come here if the plan is to catch up with someone and you do t have anywhere else to be. Otherwise go somewhere else!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-germantown-2
Josh S.,"Damascus, MD",0,2,,5.0,11/22/2017,"Very good bar and restaurant. Although my experience at the bar was dismal, I have enjoyed the many times I visit here with friends due to location and deals. Best happy hour deals in my area, due to vast selection of apps for half off, and amazing selection of coctails and drinks for half off as well. My personal favorite so far is the ""pair of Jacks"" drink which as the name implies has jack Daniels in it. And with such great deals on drinks during happy hour, I don't feel so worried that I'll get something I don't like because the drinks are only 3-5$ respectively. And as a college student it works out fine. I can't wait to try more drinks, and to go again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-germantown-2

Bianca B.,"Montgomery Village, MD",265,39,17,2.0,9/17/2017,"Stopped by for dinner and sat at the bar. My boyfriend and I ordered from the 2 for $25 menu. We ordered 2 Caesar salads for the appetizer and as for entrees, I ordered the Firecracker Shrimp pasta WITH THE SHRIMP ON THE SIDE and my boyfriend ordered the steak. Our Caesar salads came out promptly but I noticed a hair in my salad before even eating eat. I alerted the food runner and she apologized and brought a new one. I don't really recommend the Caesar salad. It's not tossed, it's just romaine drizzled with Caesar and croutons, no cheese. After we finished our salads, someone was bringing out the entrees and our server stopped the person and took the food back to the kitchen. I noticed that it was because the shrimp was on the pasta. The server then brought the food out and I alerted him that I was ALLERGIC to shrimp, so if it was the same pasta, I couldn't eat it because the shrimp had already touched it. He told me it was a new pasta and the shrimp never touched it. After having the pasta in front of me, I saw the breadcrumbs from the shrimp, IT WAS THE SAME PASTA!!! Employees should really be trained better, if someone has an allergy please don't lie to them. I'm very disappointed my server lied. He never sent a manager over to address the situation, but he took my food off. I appreciate the gesture but an allergy isn't something that should be played with.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-germantown-2

The waiter finally came over, took our drinks and appetizers order, 10 more minutes went by and he came back, empty handed and asked us for our entrees order, he took the order and left. Almost half an hour sitting there and we still didn't have our drinks, not even water. Needless to say our experience was ruined by then, and with two hungry kids things weren't pretty. The food, well not our favorite.  We've been there a few times, but this is by far the worst experience we've ever had.

TJ B.,"Gaithersburg, MD",87,429,1480,3.0,12/12/2015,"I've avoided this place because of the poor reviews, but they were unwarranted.  The place is clean, friendly with good kid's meals and fast service. We went on a Friday night.  Packed house, 5 minute wait.  Our order was taken promptly and there was never a lack of friendly servers, food runners or managers in the area if we needed anything.  They also had a game system on the table to keep the kids entertained if the crayons and coloring menus didn't do the trick. Kid's meals were $5 which included an entree, side and drink. They had $6 kid's meals which were a little bigger.  The meals were very small, but so are their appetites so I didn't mind.  One of the kids had a house salad as their side and it was great. Adult meals seem to be $10-$18.  Portions are small and the food is what you'd expect from a typical American franchise.  I didn't see anything that blew me away, but sometimes a fast affordable meal in a clean friendly environment is what you need.   They had a little bit of everything. If you need a killer burger, go to Red Robin.  If you want great ribs, go to Famous Dave's.  If you want larger portions & a better bar, drive up to Bennigans, but if you want a large variety close to home, give it a try. If anything, for me it was a reminder that sometimes you just have to see the restaurant for yourself, and not lean too heavy on the reviews.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-germantown-2

Sabir U.,"Long Beach, CA",208,122,140,1.0,2/23/2016,"If I could give this place no stars I would. Not because of the food or the staff at large, but rather a single incident that occurred here with one particular waitress. And although my problem is singular to one occasion and person, it was so impactful that it was hands down, the worst restaurant experience I've ever had.  So basically I came here with a bunch of friends. There were about 10-12 of us and this group was primarily Hispanic, Black, and Asian. We ordered drinks with one waitress but she wasn't actually our waitress. Everything was going pretty normal but then our waitress came over. She introduced herself and was a very bubbly, 20 something-ish blonde, white woman. Very quickly, things shifted. She said, ""hey so we're all young and trying to work and do our own things and so I just want to be straight forward and make sure you guys know to pay before you go and I hope we won't have any problems because none of the other waiters/waitresses wanted to serve you guys."" Um, whoa, time out. Let's take a pause. Excuse me?? So I say to her, ""I'm not sure where this is coming from but it's extremely rude. You don't even know us."" And she says, ""what's rude is you guys coming in here and leaving without paying. We have to work and earn our money and you guys just leave without paying your bill or leaving a tip."" When I told her that none of us had come to this restaurant before she then proceeded to call us liars and specifically pointed out two of my friends who apparently dined and dashed (again, none of us had been there before). By now I was ready to take the hoop rings off and smear some Vaseline. But you know I was trying to be a good person and not whoop some a** in a family establishment so I took my group out of there. This was so clearly racism, prejudice, discrimination, generalization, and all the other terms. It was so wrong I still can't believe it happened. Never again will I be going to an Applebee's, that's for damn sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-germantown-2?start=40

The 1 st plate was very small, but lots of French fries.  When he asked for more riblets, it took another 30 minutes before we got another small plate of riblets and lots of fries.   You would literally have to sit here for hours to eat the all you can eat riblets.  Not worth it.  Very annoying.  Will not be back and would not recommend applebees at all to anyone.

We got one 2 for $20 (chicken and shrimp & riblets) and one 2 for $24 (nappa chicken & 4-mac). All of the food was delicious. The Nappa Chicken was by far my favorite. Food at Applebee's just doesn't get any better than this. The 4-mac and the Honey pepper sauce sure gave that nappa chicken a run for it's money though. Did I say I was in heaven? Service: We got Kadi, and she was not bad. We sat in the bar area and she kept our drinks filled, the food came fast, and we were well attended. I was happy. Also, come on people, it's Applebee's.

Melanie K.,"Clarksburg, MD",33,225,158,3.0,2/25/2014,"We came in for dinner on Sunday night because we had a gift card. IMO, Applebee's is one of the better ""neighborhood grill"" type chains and is good for a cheap, relatively quick dinner. We've been to this location numerous times and we usually have a pretty good experience. With that in mind, we always sit in the lower bar area. There, the service has always been great. This time around, we got put in a corner booth to the right of the main entrance. No craft brews or anything ""different"" in terms of beer, but the sangria is good. I usually get the Red Apple Sangria, but went for the White Peach Sangria this time around. We almost always go for the 2 for $20 menu items because it's such a great deal, but we wanted to try the Grilled Chicken Wonton Tacos, which were surprisingly delicious. They were crunchy and packed with flavor. When it came to our entrees, we both opted to get the Fiesta Chicken Chopped Salad. The dressing was a little vinegary, but overall was good. Our server was the only thing that didn't make this a 4-star experience this time around. It's not that he was unfriendly, but he wasn't particularly friendly or likable, either. I can appreciate a server who's not in-your-face, kiss-your-butt, overly-excited, but this guy was just kinda slow-moving and ""meh.""

I've been to Applebees at different places and this is the first time I was so very disappointed. The manager came and we want to brought to his attention that we were concerned with the food.

Now my steak was good and my wife's replacement chicken was good. The manager did come over and apologize for the poor looking steak. The server was good and the ambience is your typical bar/restaurant.  Overall the food was just OK and the price for what we got wasn't that reasonable considering the poor food quality and the manager really didn't do much to have a repeat customer.

I got honey bbq ribs with fries and mixed vegetables. The ribs were a little dry and didn't have that much meat on them. They were similar to the type of ribs you find at a buffet. The mixed vegetables were like the cheap frozen kind you get at the grocery store boiled in sugar water. The other two people got two different steaks, with sides of potatoes, rice, and broccoli. One steak entree was ~$19, which was cooked perfectly but didn't taste that great at all. I would rather spend $19 for a steak somewhere else like longhorn. The other steak was better.

Harris H.,"Germantown, MD",63,223,7,1.0,10/13/2015,"Horrible experience.  We actually had a gift car to another restaurant but my wife saw a tv ad for the burger with the egg.  She insisted we go try it so I agreed.  First, let me say the service was fine due to the fact it was very busy.  Her burger came out and the egg was so dead she laughed and sent the runner back to get another one.  On the commercial the egg is runny, but this one was burnt on the outside and almost hard boiled inside.  Not sure how they could even think about putting it on the burger unless the cook was new.  My burger came out, which was the mushroom swiss, and at first glance it seemed good.  I took a couple bites into it and it was so plain and tasteless.  I then put ketchup on it and continued eating.  About 1/2 way through my burger, I made a comment to my wife that I have never had a mushroom swiss burger without some type of sauce on it.  She mentioned she saw it had it when looking at the menu and immediately pulled the online menu up on her phone.  She had plenty of time as she still hadn't gotten her egg.  Turns out my burger was supposed to have sauce, but didn't, which explained how bland and boring it was.  How the heck does the cook forget one of the main ingredients of the burger? Finally her egg came out, and she got to eat her cold burger as I was already done my meal.  Just a bad experience all the way around.  We both agreed we should have gone with our first instincts and gone to the other restaurant.  It really is bad to pay $12/burger to get this quality.  We could have gone to BGR, or a number of other places and faired much better for similar or even less money.  I tried to write corporate but apparently they let you get all the way to submit, then it tells you it can't do it and try again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-germantown-2?start=60
G Hinson W.,"Germantown, MD",0,2,,3.0,7/4/2014,"When this restaurant opened many years ago, I gave it a try.  Was not at all happy but a year or so later, gave it another shot.  Same results.  Now, about 10-12 years later, I decided to try it again figuring that it has some staying power so management must have got their act together.   I went on a Friday with my wife and a friend.  The The hostess was very nice, and seated us promptly. Restaurant was clean and well staffed.   I wanted to try the ""two for twenty"" meal they had been pushing on TV so we ordered from that menu. I ordered the 7oz Sirloin, my wife got the chicken penne.  Appetizers were served promptly and were delicious. I must admit that I normally don't like onion rings but these were great.  The wait for the food was appropriate so there was not a big gap between the time we finished the appetizers and when the entrees were brought.  Everything went downhill from there.  My steak looked great and was cooked as ordered but it was like jerky. Now I do not expect top-of-the line steak at a restaurant such as this but if you are going to put steak on the menu, it should at least be edible.   My wife's order was ok but our friend got a tough steak also. I managed to get through about 3ozs of the 7oz steak and gave up.  I asked for a box to take the balance home to my dog (she has a much stronger bite than me) and asked for the manager to come over.  I explained and expected an apology and possibly a discount or no-charge for the steak. What I go, floored me.  The manager apologized but then, she said that she didn't like the 7oz sirloin either.  She then listed a few of the options that she felt were much better than the steak and explained that for steak, she preferred ""Ruth's chris steak house.""  I couldn't believe what I was hearing.    She then offered a ""brownie bite"" as a condolence. When I got the bill, I saw that I had been charged for the brownie bite.  To her credit though, I was given a 20% discount that I hadn't expected. I mentioned the charge to the server and it was taken off.

He was all over the place, in the middle of our drink order he just walked away. Then he returned and said sorry. But then as I was giving him the drink order again he seems not to be listening or his mind was working faster then his hand. Then he toke my app order and he was hearing stuff like did u want wings and the only thing I said was spinach dip. He brought our app out with no plates.

Katie P.,"Germantown, MD",3,16,,2.0,8/24/2010,"Overall, I would say this is the worst Applebee's I've ever been to. Slow on refilling drinks. Forgetting things like ketchup for your fries. Being seated in the corner then forgotten. Having 16 year old servers spilling our beers as he brought them over. Oh, and the #1 worst thing: bringing out the main dish right after the appetizer! However, our last visit (which my husband and I both said would be our last if we experienced the same low level of service and poor quality of food) was great. It seemed like they may have changed management, as the woman (I forget her name) came over to make sure everything was ok. We ordered off of the 2 for $20 menu and the food was served quickly, hot, and delicious (well, for Applebees). We now no longer rule out this place when deciding where to go for a quick bite to eat. They also have great happy hour and late night (after 930 on weekdays) specials. Last visit brought this place up from 1 star to 2.

Oscar S.,"Germantown, MD",74,69,3,1.0,2/7/2012,"What do say when you order a steak (yes, I know it's Applebee's) medium rare and it comes out cripsy: 4th mistake. and.. What do you say when they bring you back the steak with a cow's tail still on it: 3th mistake. and.. What do you say when they send back the mooing cow back and return w/ beef jerky: 2nd mistake So.. What do you say when you make the desicion to go to Applebees for a quick dinner on a Tuesday night: 1st mistake!! Yup, this was the wonderful experience my girlfriend and I had this evening while dining at the fine establishment of Applebees in Germantown.  But it get's better.  So as you can tell they completely screwed up my steak (I know I know, it was Applebees), but the best part was how they reacted to it.   I know people make mistakes while you're out eating and sometimes things don't go they way they should.  But to completely screw up a meal and not even offer to take it off the bill or even a free desert, to me that's just unacceptable.  Oh, did I mention that I asked for cheese on my broccoli and that was screwed up too, lol.  And when they brought it back, it was burnt cheese on a plate w/ broccoli around it...uh.  Come on Applebees, we weren't expecting much but why?? So the manager by the name of Michelle C., comes up to apologize w/ the 3rd time they screwed up my steak.  And says, ""I'm sorry"".  I cut it and of course it's not right again.  At this point it's a hopeless cause.  I say, this is over cooked again but oh well.  Her answer, ""We have a new cook back there, sorry about that"".  Why is a new cook making steaks to the guests, and why is he the one fixing my steak?  So we say to her, well listen, not your fault but we're not going to pay for this steak.  Everything else is fine, but this is just unacceptable.  And she looks at me like she's confused.  So, I say again, you can take it back or leave it, but either way we're not paying for this.  Keep in mind this wasn't in an arguementive way, just being honest.  She says, well it's the 2 for $20 meal so I can't just take it off.  So we say, well ring up the app and my g/fs food and we'll pay for that.  So.....we get the bill.   She took $6.00 of the whole check.  Thanks.  I'm sorry but I used to be in the food industry for many years both on the waiting side and the bartender side.  And I guess I could say that though they were not the classiest of places(i.e. Bennigans, Fridays, Outback, Ruby Tuesdays), my managers never acted that way.  They all would have taken the meal off immediately offered some free desert, or taken more than $6.00 off the tab.   Needless to say, all we got (not that we were asking for free stuff) was a 10% off our next visit, which we won't use b/c we're not coming back, so we left that there for them and a horrible experience which could have been completely avoided just by better customer service. Needless to say, I did bring back the little piece of steak (Oh yeah, it was a freakin 7 oz strip, seriously how do you mess that up 3 times) and guess who enjoyed every little bit of it.....(drums....)  Buddy!!  My lab/husky mix pup!  I would've been extremely upset if even he didn't like lt either.  All in all, if you're going to go out for a quick bite, try McDonalds, they have really good smoothies, and at least you'll pay for what you get.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-germantown-2?start=80

Windi L.,"Arlington, VA",91,497,172,3.0,8/17/2009,"Back when I lived in Washington State and lived in a more underdeveloped area, Applebee's was the place to be. The service was quick, drinks reasonably priced, and food was pretty decent. Actually, at the time it was the bomb diggity bomb bomb as I had yet to encounter any real non chain restaurants to compare it to.  On the way home from River Tubing, our group stopped in for some food. We were starved (as that's what River Tubing will do: dehydrate you and make you HUNGRY). We all looked like crap so we didn't want to do anything too fancy so we broke out our Blackberrys and found the nearest Applebee's. This one was it.  I have to say I was very disappointed with some of the aspects of this Applebee's compared to the ones back in WA. Our server was very nice and attentive however she was very slow. They were definitely understaffed. So slow, in fact, our food came back cold and had to be sent back. To add to the chaos, my burger had cheese. Attached to the cheese was the paper that separates cheese sliced. Fortunately, their manager at this location was reasonable and replaced my dish (I then ordered the french fries and chicken fingers) and did not charge me for my dish.  Everyone left feeling sick because their portions are huge but we left satisfied. I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt because they are, well, a low budget chain joint and we all have off days. Food was decent, service decent and the things that did go wrong were fixed promptly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-germantown-2?start=80
Michael H.,"Germantown, MD",14,1,,2.0,8/7/2015,"We typically avoid Applebees due to several bad experiences in the past. We tried again and were seated near the window where the table was sticky from the lacquer finish having flaked off! Otherwise, the food was fine.  On our way out, we mentioned the sticky table to the hostess who said they've been telling management this for months and they've not done anything about it. I filled out a survey from the receipt, and to their credit, management called me to say they've fixed the tables, and asked me to come back - telling me they would discount 50% of my check for two people upon my return. We went back that night, and again the food was pretty good, but we unfortunately had an inexperienced server who would disappear for long periods of time, and at one point delivered dessert with no silverware. To make matters worse, the check was delivered and only had 20% off, not the 50% we were promised. Since the server was nowhere to be found, we calculated what the bill should have been, added tax and tip and had to seek out a manager to explain the situation and we paid in cash. Upon our return home, Applebees corporate management called again, but this time not to apologize for the poor service, but instead to accuse me of lying about the store manager offering me 50% off the check. Ridiculous.  The food and atmosphere keeps people coming in - as evidenced by the lines out the door, but even though this restaurant is very close to our home, we're displeased by the way we've been treated. For Applebees corporate management - a simple call to the store manager to verify his 50% discount offer followed by a sincere apology to us would help a lot, but insinuating that your customers are liars does not a good customer make.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-germantown-2?start=80
Shahryar M.,"Germantown, MD",5,15,5,3.0,3/4/2012,"I walked in Saturday around midnight to quench an appetite for steak.  Got greeted and seated pretty fast.  Ordered a Ribeye with veges and fries and a sweet tea to drink.  I asked for my steak to be cooked medium and it didn't take too long for it to come out but about a third of the way into it, it was definitely medium well, some parts nearly cooked well done.  Plus, it tasted a bit on the dry and bit tough and ribeye steaks are supposed to be juicy and tender.  It took a bit of time for me to get some steak sauce, but overall the server did a good job.  The server was actually pretty friendly but lacked opinion, because when i asked for recommendations, she wasn't really able to tell me what she really liked.  I thought she could use a little work on selling menu items. The steak itself was mediocre at best.  I guess it lacked seasoning but the overall taste didn't compare to other ribeye steaks i've had.  I ordered a Brownie Obsession for dessert, which I practically inhaled it was so good, and always has me coming back.  The brownie is as soft as chocolate cake and comes heated and filled with warm hot fudge in the middle, served with a fudge topping and cool vanilla ice cream. One plus is there is free wifi service which turns on when you open a browser on your mobile device and redirects you to the Applebee's website.  BTW, Applebee's might consider adding a mobile site, because their regular site takes forever to load and I have a pretty fast phone.   Another good thing about this restaurant is the hours.  If your hungry at midnight, your options in Germantown are pretty much limited to fast food.   This place is open till midnight on weekdays and till 1am on weekends. I'm giving this place three stars because of accessibility at late hours, wifi service, dessert, and friendly  service.   I'm subtracting a star for a slightly disappointing steak and another star because i just can't get myself to say i'm a fan of this place but it is definitely A-OK, so 3 and half stars at best.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-germantown-2?start=80

Tabu D.,"Gaithersburg, MD",1,6,2,1.0,2/6/2012,I should have read the reviews. We went there on Friday because I just wanted to try their under 550 calorie meals and because I have not been to Applebees since the 90's. We were seated and promptly forgotten.  10minutes later my sister had to flag down a server that turned out to be a manager. She apologized and got us a server and guaranteed us that we were in good hands and the kitchen has been told to speed up our food. Our server took out order and again was goon for another 10minutes before we got out drinks. 15 minutes later we got our food minus the appetizer we ordered. First of all the food looked nothing like the picture. They did not even try.  My sisters shrimp where cold. She sent it back and when she got a back it was apparent that it was put in the microwave. Her medium rare steak was now well done and it was horrible.  Our server promised us that she will check on the kitchen regarding our appetizer. Another 5 minutes later our appetizer was delivered and one of the managers came over to apologize. He apologized because our server had lied and forgot the appetizer and instead of admitting her mistake she blamed it on the kitchen. To make up for the inconvenience my sister's meal and the appetizer where on the house. I will never go again. There is a lack of attention to detail with the server. The restaurant was empty and anyone setted in our section had to wait for a while.

They need to perfect the way they serve their steaks. When I order a steak medium, I expect it medium not well done. Applebees should install a salad bar like Ruby's who now offers their salad bar as a side dish, great idea and last time there they were packed w/long waiting times. We got there early so didn't have to wait. Given the hard economic times the the USA, restaurants have to get creativee w/their menu's and not offer  the same old tired food.
