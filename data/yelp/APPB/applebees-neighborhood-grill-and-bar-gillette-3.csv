Rodger S.,"Gillette, WY",0,4,,5.0,12/16/2016,Best food and service in Gillette! The staff is always friendly and attentive! We went in for a burger and left with a smile. Keep up the good work Applebee's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gillette-3
Howard L.,"Park Ridge, IL",54,1064,9128,3.0,8/31/2014,"We had ok service here.  I liked my quesadilla burgers and the $1.99 PBR.  Wife did  not like the taste of her bourbon steak as it had a lamb like taste to it, so I ended up finishing part of it for her, and thought it was edible.  They had a nice deal of 2 selected entrees and an appetizer for $20.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gillette-3
Angela S.,"Cody, WY",0,15,10,1.0,7/31/2016,"Disgusting food that we waited an unbearable 40+ minutes for. After already having to leave a previous restaurant in this town, we were desperate. We thought, ""a chain food place maybe it'll be okay"" Portions were small for the price. They messed up my order twice.  $27 dollars later and I'm nauseous, not just from the price... But realizing what I'm stupid enough to put up with at a food establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gillette-3
Nick W.,"Gillette, WY",9,44,9,5.0,11/23/2015,"First off I have to say that like many others we have had many bad experiences at Applebees but we all keep going back. Second, we are SOOOOOO glad that we did yesterday for lunch. My word, it was the best experience that we have ever had there! Hands down!! It was 110% due to the waitress! She did absolutely everything perfect and her tip proved it! We did not catch her name because we decided to write a nice note on the back of the ticket because they do digital receipts now. I just hope that everyone working there continues to strive to be as wonderful as she was! Thanks again for the great service mystery waitress.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gillette-3
Kurt C.,"Fairfax, VA",75,407,156,1.0,7/24/2014,"This was quite possibly the worst experience my wife and I have had at a restaurant in recent memory. No one died, there was no natural disaster, just old classically bad service. It started when we walked through the door - the hostess ignored me for a minute before trying to figure out where to put us. The seating chart wasn't up to date, and after a full table or two, they finally found us a spot. Our waitress (Heather) was out of it - obviously didn't want to be there. She took our drink orders, and I had to stop her to say we were ready for the full order. Then, she disappeared. After a long wait, someone else brought us water. A while after that, a second someone else brought us our appetizer. Finally, a third someone else brought us our food. We still didn't have silverware... We had to ask for it, and it wasn't even rolled in a napkin - not a big deal, but noticeable since there were plenty of servers standing around talking rather than preparing silverware. I miss states with smoking bans in restaurants. The entire place (and most everyone who worked there) smelled like an ash tray. It was pretty obvious that some of them were constantly taking smoke breaks, but the old women puffing away at the bar weren't helping the matter. The manager did the usual pop into random tables to see how it was going, but he ignored us for a while. Eventually, we spotted our original waitress and asked for more water (I always put my empty glass at the edge of table so they can see it, but no one got the hint). She disappeared again, but this time, we saw her soon enough, talking to another waitress. We had to ask again for our waters, which were eventually brought by someone else. Our food was OK, not bad, per se, but definitely not as good as normal. We usually like Applebee's food. It's not amazing, but it's usually good. When we were finished, we pushed our plates away, stacked our silverware, and waited. And waited. And waited. At one point, we thought our waitress was coming by, but then we heard another waitress lead her away to see something outside. Awesome. After a while, the manager came back around, and we asked him for our check and some to-go boxes. It's always funny to see managers try to do actual work... He came by again to take my card (and left the receipt without a pen to sign it). A bit later, our waitress came back by, and seemed a bit surprised that we had paid already, and tried to reconcile by asking how it was, which was too little too late. Should have just wend to Taco Bell.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gillette-3
Sundeep R.,"Biloxi, MS",10,5,2,1.0,11/6/2015,Waited in the front. No one took my name to be seated. The workers were talking amongst themselves as if i wasn't even there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gillette-3
Deidre J.,"Gillette, WY",0,2,,2.0,8/25/2015,"My husband took me out to lunch because our youngest child started kindergarten today.  He wanted a burger and we chose Applebee's because of the new brunch burger.  He liked his burger and he got the option of multiple, fries, onion ring sides.  He chose the sweet potato fries and enjoyed those as well. I decided to have the Riblet platter.  Figured I couldn't really go wrong with a signature dish.  I didn't get an option for my sides.  I did get an option for the sauce on my ribs and chose a sweet spicy asian sauce.  The ribs had a texture like they went from the freezer to the microwave.  There was sauce on them but it added no flavor.  I couldn't eat more than one strip of them.  My husband asked what I thought and my sentiments were that ""I've had McRib sandwiches more satisfying than these.""  He tried some and he agreed. We got an order of their chicken wonton tacos to share.  The flavor was good but our feeling on those was ""Those are expensive little tacos."" The servers were all sub-par.  I'll give them that we came in after what should have been their lunch rush hour but I don't think it was all that busy.  The server we had barely seemed like she got out of her pajamas to put on the uniform.  Numerous others seemed to be unable to make a trip to or from their table without asking the manager (sitting at a nearby table) a question about one thing or another. It was like the staff on breaks thought they were invisible to the customers.  The language was foul and the attitude was like customers, previous or current, were just a thorn in their side.  I have been increasingly unimpressed with Applebee's everywhere over the last few years but the impression I got from staff here in Gillette will seal the deal on me not wanting to go back.  The food is poor to begin with and if I am subjected to such negativity too, there's no reason to go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gillette-3
Don E.,"Salina, KS",4,199,8,3.0,4/3/2015,Food was good. Arline S. the server either was very new or just plain bad. It took 15 minutes to get our bill. Might be able to understand if it was busy but it wasn't.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gillette-3
Michele B.,"Tulalip, WA",5,33,,1.0,3/26/2015,Mediocre just like the other locations.  Service was good food not so much.  Won't be back. Cheese sticks yucky.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gillette-3
Sharon W.,"San Diego, CA",0,9,,4.0,6/2/2015,We ordered chicken tortilla  soup got tomato- didn't have silverware  so asked for napkins git bar napkins- but when we got our food it was EXCELLENT!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gillette-3
James S.,"Claremore, OK",39,14,,4.0,3/24/2015,"I've read and heard many complaints about this Applebee's. Everything from terrible food and awful service. Let me tell you, I've been traveling to Gillette since 2005. I've graced the doors of this establishment many times. The food has been consistently good and the service has been outstanding. Don't know what has gone wrong for those who have had bad experiences and don't  doubt what they have said. All I can say is I've always had a good experience. That being said there have been a few wacko locals that have made me wonder about Gillette. Lol.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gillette-3
Ben T.,"Lebanon, OR",30,34,94,5.0,1/5/2015,"I wasn't expecting much from our late nite visit to this Applebee's, but after a long day of traveling at 35 mph through blizzards it was the closest thing to our hotel that was open. I was pleasantly surprised by our visit. The local beer on tap was excellent, the burger I ordered on happy hour pricing that made it cheaper than a fast food burger was cooked perfectly and tasted really good. Actually med rare and salted properly. To add extra bonus points to our visit our bartender Kasie was great. Very friendly, patient and in general did a great job putting up with two tired guys. Thank you for a nice surprise in Gillette.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gillette-3
Erin S.,"Gillette, WY",1,34,3,2.0,8/18/2014,Worst place to eat in all of Gillette. I've given it 4 different times to win me and my family over and they failed miserably each time. My daughters Mac n Cheese was reheated Kraft  Mac n Cheese. I had a fajita where all the meat and veggies were burnt to the plate and the guacamole tasted like flour paste.  I think their issue is that their kitchen is run by teenagers who just don't care. The absolute only reason their parking lot is always packed is their bar. The service is also terrible!! We had a waitress take her break without having another server cover our table. We sat with food and no drinks for 15min and when she returned she was so busy catching up on her tables out food went cold before she came by with HALF our drink orders. A manager wandering the place asking ppl if everything was ok shrugged when I mentioned the guacamole didn't even look like guacamole let alone tasted good. He shrugged and walked off. Only go here if you like bars in restaurants cause the food and service will only disappoint. They need to hire some adults with experience in the food industry.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gillette-3
Al D.,"Gillette, WY",14,20,,1.0,6/10/2014,Service is lousy. The food is not up to the chain's standard.  Best just to drive to the next town.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gillette-3
Crystal S.,"Dearborn, MO",6,23,5,2.0,7/19/2014,This place is alright! The service is hit or miss! Sometimes the spinach dip is good & other times it's watery! Been here 3times 2 times the server was horrible & so was the dip!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gillette-3
Jared K.,"Gillette, WY",0,14,,2.0,4/17/2014,Eaten here several times over the past three years I've lived in Gillette and each time I receive consistently poor service as well as food. However as a cheaper alternative to other higher priced restaurants in town it's not as bad but still deserves a poor review for its poor product quality and service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gillette-3
Larry B.,"Papillion, NE",0,4,,4.0,9/22/2014,"Service was perfect (Amy) and the food that we ordered was good.  Our only disappointment was a ""chain store"" issue in that they discontinued the chicken fajitas from the menu so we ordered alternatives. It will probably be awhile before we return so maybe Applebee's will rethink this menu decision.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gillette-3
Ed B.,"Bridgman, MI",0,5,,4.0,6/14/2014,"Typical Applebee's. Food was good, but hard to find an item that is not salty. Easy to please my kids with the menu.  Did not detect any smoke. Staff was friendly with our visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gillette-3
Rogan M.,"Denver, CO",42,51,15,1.0,1/11/2011,"Ok, so i've got a bit of a problem with Applebee's. The problem stems ""almost"" 100% from the fact that they allow smoking in the place. Seriously? Smoking in a family restaraunt? I can understand a bar, or maybe a more divey kind of restaraunt but Applebee's? I'm not really a fan of chain places like this to begin with so to add the billowing of cigarette smoke on top of my half bland food and pretty blah service and I am not to impressed.  I know Wyoming has it's independent, libertarian, leave me alone to do whatever the hell I want thing going. It's part of the charm of this state, we aren't politically correct and we don't give a damn, just leave us alone to do our own thing. But smoking in restaraunts where little kids are running around is kinda strange to me, no? I'm not going to be one of those people that jumps up and down and pushes for a law banning it or anything but atleast get some good ventilation going in there so I don't have to choke on someone's smoke from 20ft away.  It's hard to enjoy my lunch when I walk out smelling like I was at Jake's Tavern all night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gillette-3
Jessica W.,"Roanoke, VA",3,64,3,3.0,12/27/2010,It's a toss up whether you will get good service or good food. Shift times doesn't matter. Good luck!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gillette-3
