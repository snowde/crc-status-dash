Sherry H.,"San Jose, CA",91,14,1,3.0,1/10/2018,Good afternoon.     I called in an order. And. Low and behold.   When I say NO PICKLES.  THATS WHAT I MEAN.   I was pleased that it didn't take long.   But.  CMON.  No Puckles.  PLEASE.  Not ON MY FOOD.    Other than that.    I love Applebee's.   Their fries are AWESOME.    Geeeeez.    Jus sayin....  The place is clean friendly.   Great service.    The whole 5 star thing.   But when you ruin my burger with Pickles.   Your Stars fall off.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gilroy-6
Laurie M.,"Elk Grove, CA",7,22,24,4.0,12/30/2017,This Applebee's was very busy when we came for early dinner (5 pm)...probably because of the season (Christmas) and location. It took a while to seat us even though there were several tables open. But our server was prompt and gave us our appetizers quickly. The portions seemed more generous and fresher than other Applebee's we've been to (Palm Springs and Elk Grove). The rest of the meal was good too but took a while to come. We had a really efficient and attentive server (Yoanna)...most enjoyable meal at Applebee's yet!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gilroy-6
Bhavin P.,"Arlington, TX",99,2,,1.0,12/26/2017,"Worst service ever. This place is in the middle of Gilroy outlets and for it being in a prime area where a lot of traffic comes thru, you'd think this place is a nice establishment. Well, this place is the worst. The restaurant is nasty, not very clean, and waiters/waitresses are not very attentive. I ordered a whiskey bacon burger well done. When my order came out, my burger was pink and not well done. I called the waitress to tell her, she took it back and I didn't see my food ever again. It took them so long to correct the mistake I ended up canceling my order because we were there for about 2 hours now and we wanted to go to the stores before they closed. If I could, I would give this place 0 stars. Will not be coming back to this place ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gilroy-6
Timothy D.,"Milpitas, CA",227,40,122,2.0,5/30/2017,"Applebee's has never been a go to food place for me or anyone I know. If anything it presents itself with a nice building but mediocre food.  When we went the room was packed, so we waited around 20-30 minutes for seating which was fine. It was warm outside and the indoors was somewhat cool. We got seated by our server, Amanda. She did the best she could and I don't blame her for anything. She was great! I decided to order the new Fire Roasted Chicken Salad Wrap with a Cesar Salad for the lunch combo. I had high expectations because it mentioned it being spicy. Knowing myself, I LOVE SPICY. My mom was about to get that but was worried it was going to be too spicy, so she asked what was in it that gave it heat. Amanda replied that it was mixed with sriracha (which in my opinion is not even spicy at all).  We wait a bit then receive our food. Everyone's portions seemed a lot larger than mine. The salad seemed small and it looked like I was missing half of my wrap. The plate landing on the table made me feel incomplete because my food looked incomplete. After some disappointment, I began to eat. I wanted a lot more dressing on my salad, but aside from that it was fine. More croutons could have helped but that's just me loving bread. The wrap however looked dinky. Half a wrap. It was a mere 3-4 inches long. It looked promising because of the amount of chicken and lettuce it held. One bite in, no spice. There was a lot of healthy flavors going on, but as I continued I was wondering where the spice was. There was no heat at all. I wasn't dying for water or sweating. It was nice, but could have been better with the some sort of spiciness.  Overall my portion size could have been more and things could have had more flavors. I would say I'd go here again but I'm not: 1) Because Gilroy is far away from me 2) Because the food was not up to my expectation and I could have been more full if I spent my money elsewhere",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gilroy-6

We ordered the 2 for $20. Sad, not as many choices. We ordered the onion rings for appetizers (a little over cooked), the chicken tenders (way over cooked, dry), grilled fiesta lime chicken (nothing special, liked the shredded tortilla chips though).  Riblet basket  is no longer a 2 for $20 option, nor the chicken and shrimp.

Mindy S.,"Gilroy, CA",31,30,6,1.0,4/4/2017,"This place has really gone downhill. I used to be a manager here in the early 2000's and we would have NEVER accepted the level of service and food quality that is going on here now.  We were seated pretty quickly, but that was the end of the attention we got. Luckily my buddy Jayne still works here as a bartender and I was able to get her attention to find a server.  Attached is the picture of the 2 for $25 'half rack' of ribs my husband waited 10 minutes longer than the 25 minutes the rest of us waited for our food,  which was cold when it arrived anyway.

Fred B.,"Morgan Hill, CA",52,14,,1.0,11/24/2017,"We have usually had good food and service here. The problem we have noticed is the management is clearly lacking. The final straw for us ever going there again was the week before last when we saw the bartender refuse to serve an underaged girl at a table with two other legal aged ladies. These ladies just kept feeding the underaged girl their drinks. After a while the very busy bartender caught on and removed all the drinks from the table(which she legally had to do, since I have been a bartender myself). The bartender went to management to 86 the three people since they were pretty much yelling cuss words at her and the management would not back her up. It looked like the bartender quit on the spot because of this type of thing happening before. That was the last time we go!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gilroy-6

I got the smaller portion chicken with apples and quinoa and the person was just right. After eating about 1/3 of the sampler appetizer and this chicken meal I actually was pretty full.  It's a light dish and wouldn't recommend it for someone with a hearty appetite. The apples and celery were a nice pair and the rice-quinoa serving nestled underneath the 2-4 oz chicken breast had dried cranberries, such a yummy combination of flavors!

She then verified my name and then brought me the bill to sign before seeing the   she brought it out I should've looked at it but it was wrapped up nice and neat so I figured OK I'll take it home.

My wife had the cedar plank salmon which is more like salmon jerky, hard as a rock.

Wife sent it back to get a new one cooked all the way through. The second one they brought out was again undercooked.

It was nearing the late afternoon and we hadn't eaten all day, so we decided to have lunner (late lunch +early dinner = lunner?!) at Applebee's. We didn't have to wait long and were seated quickly. We ordered: Perfect patron margarita: patron silver 100% agave tequila and patron citronge with perfect margarita mix ($9.75) - Came with a shaker of the extra margarita. A huge serving but very weak. There wasn't much alcohol in it. House salad (no croutons) with ranch ($3.25) - Average house salad with mixed greens, tomatoes and cheese. The greens were crisp and fresh. I enjoyed the salad.  9oz house sirloin: classic steakhouse cut, served with seasonal vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes ($15.49) - This was the roommate's dish. It looked fine, but kind of bland. He seemed to enjoy it as long as he had some A1. Appetizer sampler: Mozzarella sticks, Spinach & artichoke dip, Cheese quesadilla grande, Boneless buffalo wings ($12.99) - I'm a variety kind of girl so I thought this would be good for me. Unfortunately the Mozzarella sticks weren't hot and gooey and the Spanish & artichoke dip needed seasoning. I had to add salt to it to eat it. The Boneless buffalo wings were okay when dipped in ranch. And the Cheese quesadilla grande tasted fine with the salsa.  Butter pecan blondie: baked with nuts, topped with ice cream and glazed pecans covered with a rich, cream cheese sauce ($5.49) - Apparently the roommate orders this every time he goes to Applebee's. I found it way too sweet, but he loved it! So I basically had an average food experience for an Applebee's. Subtracting a star due to our odd server. When we were ready to order, it took a while to flag him down since initially he came by too early. Throughout service he seemed to forget to bring us things. When we were done, we needed boxes and asked him for some. We boxed up our own food and then realized he didn't bring a container for the Spinach & artichoke dip. I asked for a soup container but he said he could bring the plate to the back and box it up himself. He was a little insistent so I said fine. Some time passes and he comes back saying someone dropped the plate and we're making us a new one to go. I appreciate the gesture and it was the right thing to do, but I totally could have boxed up the food myself! Plus the server made it seemed like they were doing us a favor and we lucked out!

Timo L.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,4,,1.0,12/30/2015,"Ug. Geez. Ok.  I get it.   I had medium expectations too, but didn't expect this:  You may have been on the road (I-5) for hours, or spent the day elbowing your way through the not so great deal Outlet Malls, and you are tired, and hungry.  So you think to yourself- ""Let's just go to Applebees- can't be that bad- it's supposed to be a step above...ie. Chili's etc."" FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY.  STOP AND THINK FOR JUST A MOMENT! Do yourself a favor- go over to In-n-Out again, or Mc Donalds, or even the Hot dog stand at the Home Depot (great guy and a local secret favorite by the way). BUT AVOID THIS STICKY, SMELLY, HONEY BOO-BOO DATE NIGHT DESTINATION OF INDIGESTION AT ANY COST! Really.  I wish I could say otherwise, but as one of the busiest Applebees in the country you would think that they would: 1: Understand that it smells like a shuttered up zookeepers shower room in Orlando in August. 2: Understand that occasionally wiping the last 30 diners sputum off the table with actual cleanser is a positive thing. 3: Wilted, soggy, cold, unseasoned greens placed in a jumble with boiled until deceased (and likewise completely unseasoned) new potatoes holding hands with what could only be described as a cadaverous excuse for poor Flossy the milk cow's tumerous beef growth is not a steak dinner. 4. Mac and Cheese, covered with dried chicken (I hope) tenders, and then drenched with a brown embalming fluid is not  American, comfort food, or even possibly legal in some states. 5. Artichoke what?  on Salmon?  Wha?  Ew.  Wilted, wet and uncomfortable once again. 6. There are beers that you say you have but you don't because they are only in some restaurants but not this one? But they are on the friggin menu but your server can't get them for you 'cause whatever 'cause whatever 'cause well to hell with it.  (Try some alcohol in your mixed drinks too, if you can afford to put another lump of coal on the fire Uncle Scrooggelebee.) I could go on, but won't.  I think you get it. Recommendations to Applebees parent company or otherwise: 1.  Every single night clean the **** out of this place.  Stem to Stern. Figure out with cadaver dogs or otherwise where that smell is coming from. (Carpet, chairs and tables probably in that order Mr. Manager.) 2.  Send your head chef ( the guy who makes up dishes such as the aforementioned wouldn't serve it to Gitmo prisoners Mac -n-Cheese) well..... to Gitmo (before it closes down or just leave them there.) Good grief- everything was just awful- even to look at.   3.  Retrain the entire staff- they probably thought one of the perks of working there was eating for free...I feel so sorry for them. Please give them meaning in life by allowing them to serve decent, non-hybridized, over reaching, godawful attempts at some sort of American cuisine.  Tone it down in the kitchen.  just make it good.  Simple. Tasty.  Your customers are the tired and newly poor (Outlet Malls again) and need to treated as such.  Not given literally what could be their last meal before they contact some incurable virus from the environs and cross the dark divide.  4. Remember what it means to be in charge of what was once one of the most sought after restaurant chains for groups such as the Ladies Auxiliary retirement club, or the speed dater's anonymous Wednesday group, or the Holiday Inn Express next door go to place.  C'mon people, you were great once.  ( I think) ( I heard it somewhere).  This isn't complicated.  Throw on some clean socks, slick back your hair, hike up you khakis, and make Gilroy's Applebees the apple of your eye!  Imagine how it will look on your restaurant improvement resume when you attend the managers convention for DineEquity in BEEEAUTIful Gelndale California.  Yea!

I was brought my order  (mind you my family is half done with their foot at this point) again I'm brought the wrong meal and then told by my waiter that what he brought was what I ordered.... ummmm I can tell by looking at the plate that it's not and it was filled with food that I'm allergic to.

To sum up: Terrible service Average food No bathroom Bathroom: The staff said their bathroom is under construction and there was a white bathroom outside (that looked like a container or a huge generator from the outside of it).. I get that at least it is something and that they would be worst off without nothing, but it did made our experience at the restaurant worse.. Service: Went there with my mom after some shopping. We were greeted at the front and they didn't get my mom's name correct... Her name is common and my guess is that they didn't really pay attention and didn't want to ask again. We were seated after maybe 5 minutes (was about 2pm) and I think they forgot about us at that moment. No water or anything was brought to us... We waited for 15 minutes easily before I stood up and energetically waved both my arms to get a waiter's attention.  Btw, do not expect that any waiter, other than the one serving you,  will care about you. 2 other waiters were looking directly at me during this 15 min period and they did notice me calling them (you can tell because they focus their eyes at you) only to look away... (I swear I could listen to one of them saying in his mind ""not my problem"" and walking away) Food: Finally we ordered and 5 minutes latter comes our waiter saying that they were out of some ingredients from the side dish from the orange chicken that my mom ordered, and if they could replace them with something else (I'm fine with that). Then because of the delay on my mom's food, my plate arrives early (not the best practice.. But ok...) And after some more time then her orange chicken finally arrives... And it tastes awful. Tasted like a poorly made chicken nugget with some orange seasoning on top.. She then asked to trade it for a ceasar salad wich was ok. Next time I am at the outlet I will consider other options and even McD. before this applebees again.

Hardly an apology for spilling a whole glass of water over my wife and myself. And no, this soda is on me etc. Other places do this as a matter of course but this place failed. To me it's accepted practice and common decency. Lucky it was not soda or anything stronger because that would have been a real smack in the face.

Don't use sharp cheddar OR any flavorful cheese. If everything in the bowl is bland, then the garlic toast will stand out. Caz obviously I'm ordering Mac & Cheese for the garlic toast.  5.

Nancy C.,"San Francisco, CA",39,36,7,4.0,1/15/2013,"This was my first time at Applebee's, mostly because I tend to gravitate towards food places/restaurants that aren't chains (except for McDonald's and Burger King). Also, I saw an ad for Applebee's the night before, talking about their $9.99 specials or whatever, so I was intrigued.  So, I came here on Sunday with two other people. We were seated at a booth by this one girl standing at the entrance. She gave us our menus and we deliberated for a long time since their $9.99 deal or whatever it is (it's like one entree with some other things for a certain price that's offered everyday except for Sunday) wasn't offered that day. We ultimately decided on getting the two entree and appetizer for only $20. Now, the menu is kind of tricky because it says 2 entrees for $20. I asked our server - I'm pretty sure her name is Cyndi - if appetizers were included in that $20 and she said yes. Obviously, I was all excited because the portions, judging from others' tables, looked huge and the options available seemed delicious. We ordered BBQ chicken nugget things which came with celery and ranch, and our two entrees were: Oriental Chicken Salad and Southwest Shrimp Fettuccine. I also asked for three plates since we were sharing. Our server asked us if we wanted everything at once and we said yes. We ordered waters (drinks aren't included in this $20 deal thing), and waited for our food to come. This place has really great decor. I'm a huge fan of old vintage novelties and just sitting there was great. Anyways, our food came after about ten minutes and the three of us finished the entrees and appetizer after 45 minutes or so. The BBQ chicken nugget things were sooooo good. There were actually quite a lot of pieces for an appetizer and it was seasoned nicely and the flavor was great. There's nothing else to really say about this since they were just good. The Southwest Shrimp Fettuccine was slightly spicy, but came with an abundance of shrimp. The noodles were covered in a creamy white sauce that was slightly saltier than it should have been. But with the shrimp and some beans and corn included in it, the dish was more spicy than salty. The flavor was good, especially since I'm a fan of spicy food. The Oriental Chicken Salad was alright. I'm not a fan of sweet dressing, which well, it was. The lettuce and stuff seemed to be taken out of one of those salad kits you get at Costco - it was shredded and seemed pre-packaged. However, the grilled chicken (we got a choice between fried or grilled) was super good. It wasn't tough; it was tender, there was a lot of it, and it was filling. There were also little fried noodles in it, which, I suppose, makes it ""oriental."" Gosh, they should really change the name of this dish... But that's besides the point. Our server came back again and gave us the check after we asked. We paid and then she came back with our change. I didn't notice it until after we paid, but there was a small hand-written note on top of the receipt that said ""Thank you! =)"" with a hand-drawn heart and I think the person's name was Angie. .... Our server was probably Angie then? Or Cyndi? I don't really know, but whoever it was, it was a nice personal touch!  Anyway, our total came out to be $21 and some cents. For three dishes - since the appetizer came with so much chicken it basically counted as a freaking entree - for $21, it was a steal! And with great service - food came quickly, server was nice and attentive, that personal note on the receipt, and having our server actually say bye to us as we left - this was a good meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gilroy-6?start=140

It turned out that  the next morning I realized that my credit card was missing and found out when I called the credit card company that it was misused. It was used for fraudulent charges near that Applebees restaurant. My guess is somebody in that restaurant has misused my credit card because after that dinner I went straight back home and realized that in the next morning the card was not in my wallet.

Becky B.,"Gilroy, CA",6,40,5,1.0,7/30/2010,"I would have to agree with many of the yelp reviewers, when I walk into a restaurant...I would like to feel welcome...if you are employed with the simple task of standing by the door, smiling, and escorting customers to a table...the LEAST you can do is smile and be polite. I will start with my story...my best friend, my son, and I went out to Gilroy for a fun day out of outlet shopping...when we got hungry, we decided to give Applebee's a try. My prior experiences with this particular place had neither been good nor bad...so in we went...we were greeted by the ""bitchiest"" employee I have ever met. He did not smile, did not greet us, did not even ask how many people in our party...in fact...we seemed to have disturbed his afternoon. After what seemed to be a long and silent walk over to our table...he practically threw our menus at us, rolled his eyes, and walked away. That should have been our 1st clue, that we should have packed it all up and left...our server, took his sweet time coming over...and really did not seem to be in the mood to be dealing with customers but he accurately took down our orders and disappeared. We barely saw him, from the time he took our food orders until the time the food came and then he became attentive, asking if we needed refills, etc. My guess, is that he was taking this opportunity to start earning his tip... I won't be going back...any place that doesn't bother to check up on and regulate their employee's behavior and how they interact with customers is not getting a single penny from me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gilroy-6?start=200
Raul N.,"Pacific Grove, CA",234,415,761,2.0,2/14/2010,"I headed over to Gilroy today for a quick trip to the J. Crew outlet and decided to grab dinner here too. Settled on Applebee's--not my choice--for dinner. Now, I've never been to an Applebee's before, so this was quite the experience for me. The menu was certainly eclectic--a mix of different cuisines. And the décor was, um, interesting. After poring over the menu, I settled on one of Applebee's new ""under 500 calories"" dinners. Now I'm not one to usually count calories--I did, after all, unabashedly have an apple tarte tatin with lunch the other day--but when the calorie counts are provided on the menu and you see the average dish carries 1,000+ calories, well, you can't help but seek out the healthier fare. I tried the Dijon chicken with Portobello mushrooms. It wasn't terrible--sure, a little salty, and the chicken had that artificial ""smoky"" flavor that's common at chain restaurants, but the Portobellos and roasted red peppers offered a nice flavor. The sides--seasonal veggies and potatoes--were pretty bland, like an overcooked TV dinner. I was pleasantly surprised by our service. The restaurant was packed--we had completely forgotten it was Valentine's Day, after all--but we didn't have to wait too long for a table during the dinner rush. Our service was a little slow, but considering every table was packed, I was impressed how quickly we got our food. Will I be back? Probably not--next time my stomach starts rumbling while I'm outlet shopping, I'll stick with In-N-Out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gilroy-6?start=200

Es E.,"San Francisco, CA",11,48,13,1.0,5/29/2008,"Here's a copy of a complaint letter I sent to Applebee's. I realize it may fall on deaf ears but what we experienced was something we hope would not befall other unsuspecting would-be patrons: ""We arrived for lunch on Memorial Day and was informed that there would be a 20 - 25 minute wait. Seeing the queue we understood and patiently waited. Finally, after watching many other parties get seated ahead of us, we were seated after 45 minutes! (I understood what was happening - we were a party of 12 and the other patrons who were being seated earlier were smaller parties; however, I had informed the staff that since we had an elderly aunt with us sitting in the car outside that we did not mind being seated in different areas. Apparently, this was not taken into account.) When we were seated (at two adjacent tables), our server Rebekah gruffly asked for our drink orders, not even giving us a minute to breathe and consider our choices. By this point we were still patient and took into consideration that the restaurant was packed solid on a holiday. However, when she found that two of our party was missing she launched into a very condescending and rude tirade about if we weren't all at the table in five minutes we would have to leave! We tried to explain that having waited for about 45 minutes that the other people in the party were in the car in front of the restaurant. She would have none of it and as we protested being addressed in this manner she rudely insisted we should have been all waiting at the door for our table. At this point, many in our party were aghast at this treatment. I said that we should have another person serve us.  A server named Monica promptly swooped in and the service could not have been any more pleasant or different from Rebekah's. Her skill and demeanor quickly eased the tension and we persuaded my relatively weak aunt to calm down. The last thing we wanted was for her to have an attack right there and then! Monica informed us that, 'She gets that a lot.' (Possibly referring to other complaints being lodged at Rebekah.) Rebekah would be going on break. We were relieved and tried to enjoy our meal. My family are big travelers, are used to dining out and experiencing various levels of service and are usually patient and understanding of what happens in situations where the conditions aren't ideal. However, the treatment we received was inexcusable. I had been debating whether or not to file a complaint since I realize that Rebekah's employment might be negatively affected - but we did not pay good money to be abused in public.  To our chagrin, Rebekah returned to our table with a demeanor that was very solicitous, upbeat and what could be termed only as 'uncomfortably familiar'. This only succeeded in further making the situation more bizarre as this just gave us a sense of how she could just be absolutely false. We were, as the kids would say, 'weirded out'. Despite the impulse to do so, we left a 15% gratuity in line with proper etiquette (although we had even overheard the party behind us say that they weren't going to leave anything) .  Never again Applebee's. From this point on, if ever we're in a bind and we need to eat at this sort of venue - Denny's gets our business."" I've only eaten at an Applebee's on one other occasion in my life and thought that this would be at least a generically serviceable, if not pleasant, experience. If in a crunch, Denny's usually does ok.  I expected no less. But I was wrong. Dead wrong.  In these tough economic times they need to shape up. Do yourselves a favor and go to In-n-Out nearby if you ever make it to Gilroy (I know it was a bad move to go on Memorial Day in the first place... or even, just to go to Gilroy. Period.) And don't get me started about the food. UPDATE 5.30.08 Received a phone call from Applebee's corporate on the same day I sent the complaint online. I was impressed!!! I received profuse apologies and the person who read the complaint had spoken to the server involved (who told him a lie to cover her sorry ass - but no matter).  Very impressed with the people in corporate in this instance. Now if only the people who give the brand a face would treat their customers with professionalism and respect.

Food:  Been dragged here 3 times. First 2 visits gave me explosive geyser-shits that damn near lifted me off the toilet seat. 3rd time I didn't have a soda because I remembered their being a sort of chemical taste. I had a bottled drink. No squirts. I'm definitely calling the Food & Health Dept. I had an Oriental Chicken Salad. It was pretty well oriented.  They were nice enough to substitute grilled chicken instead of the fried chicken. I think form DS3 ""Standard Deviation Substitution Agreement"" had to be filled out by the cook though.  Greens were fresh. Chicken looked just like rubber!!! How do they manufacture their chicken. There was almost no grain or texture to it. Bizarre.  I heard that all of the grilled meat is pre-grillled in advance and shipped like that so they just heat it up. I can't prove that though.  Atmosphere: Every move and word the workers make follows strict guidelines in a 3-ring binder from corporate HQ. For example- Article ii of section B, sub paragraph 31 says that the greeter shall pre-greet each guest before the host greets them. Both greetings shall be perky and look each guest in the eye and treat them like your favorite uncle Bob.  Check this box if you have completed your mandatory greeting training with the Uncle Bob standard issue training dummy.

The food (no matter what was ordered) was always gross.  I was lucky if they threw 10 beans on my order of nachos. The menu has also changed a LOT the past few years. The ONLY consistently good item on the menu was the Oriental Chicken Salad.  The best I have ever had. Tonight, I forced myself to come here only because I was given a gift card for Christmas. Again, I noticed the menu had changed (BIG Surprise). But this time, there seemed to be at least a few things i wouldn't mind trying. Tonight I had the new Tuscan Pesto Chicken Ciabatta. (I did substitute the chicken for turkey).  The Ciabatta bread was outstanding.  Perfectly soft and seasoned just right.  There was the perfect amount of pesto too.  This sandwich was SO good that I didn't even want to eat my french fries. (Anyone that knows me knows that i LOVE my french fries). I am happy that Applebees seems to be trying to make some sort of comeback. I just hope that they don't change the menu AGAIN and take this bad boy off. PS - I do have to say that I have always liked their Perfect Margaritas.  Not the best margarita I have had, but it's a nice alternative to ones typically served.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gilroy-6?start=220

It came with seasoned fries (I'm not a french fry fan) and I ate almost every one. -I consistently like their Santa Fe Chicken Salad (nice amount of chicken, greens,guacamole, sour cream, pico de gallo, and a bit of a kick) -Their loaded mashed potatoes are a heart-attack in the making, but god....they are good -I've had several steak and shrimp combos which were good -My daughter loves the mac and cheese that comes with garlic toast and applesauce Decent prices too.

Sophia B.,"Gilroy, CA",0,1,,4.0,4/11/2012,"I thoroughly enjoy the atmosphere here, like any other restaurant in a small town with nothing to do or nowhere to go, If you want a more quiet meal, come during the day, if your looking for a hang out spot to drink, eat cheap appetizers, and meet up with half of Gilroy, then come at happy hour. People complain so much about bad service and food being half assed. Remember that some of these people come to work right after leaving their second job, to only go to another job after clocking out at apple bees. Ive had many good experiences here and for the most part see the staff doing their best while still enjoying their jobs. Its a hard business serving hundreds a day, and maybe thousands a week. Especially in this location i give them props. Might i add if you do happen to go in and you see monica at the bar, i urge you to swipe a seat at the bar. She should be named one of the top bartenders in Gilroy, not because drinks are fabulous seeing as it is a corporation, but her demeanor and personality make the experience worth it. Great job Monica and i will always look forward to seeing you. As for all the people that complain of the service... DONT go back, i know way too many people that go back even after they post ridiculously mean things on here. So to everyone in the food industry. Hats off to you all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gilroy-6?start=240
Shakeel A.,"San Jose, CA",2,64,2,1.0,1/2/2011,"Went in today at around 2:00 pm and had horrendous service! We placed a fairly simple order. We wanted an appetizer and two sizzling steak and cheese entrees(not the 2 for 20 deal) and wanted our steaks well done. After our orders were taken, about 15-20 minutes our steaks come out. I asked about our appetizer and she said she forgot and was going to place the order for it now. I told her forget it because if she brings it out after we have our entrees it does not remain an ""appitizer"", mistakes happen. I guess it was also my fault also, we should have realized she did not write down our order from the beginning. We cut into our steaks and they were rare. So we had to wait for 5 minutes until we flagged down someone and asked if we could see our waiter. She finally arrived and we told her our steaks were rare, not medium otherwise we would have managed. She took our steaks and diappeared. 15 minutes pass, then 20, then 30 finally after 40 minutes we again had to flag her down and asked about our steaks. After our steaks were returned she came to us saying that she made a request for the steaks to be remade(you could not just grill the same steaks with all the cheese on it) and it was taking longer because our orders were given to someone else. OUR ORDERS WERE given to another table and told me it will take them about 10-15 minutes more for our orders!!!!! She sort of smiled as she told us this and left. At this moment we were more than an hour and had had enough. We asked someone else to get the manager. The manager comes out 5 minutes later with two sizzling steaks!!!!!! I think they were someone elses order because one had fries with it instead of the usual mash potatoes. The manager put the food in front of us and told us that it took long because they wanted to make sure our food was properly prepared. I told him that about 5 minutes ago we were told our food was given to another table and that it took them almost an hour to cook it a second time around? Anyways with the manager standing we cut into our steaks and guess what...... rare as rare could be.... not medium.... we had had enough.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gilroy-6?start=240
Jeff S.,"Gig Harbor, WA",0,77,29,2.0,7/3/2011,"What happened? Okay, it's a chain restaurant, but lunch was not what it was supposed to be - literally. We were interested in trying some new things and have had success with the WW Points Plus items. He ordered the Paradise Salad and I ordered the Spicy Pineapple Glazed Shrimp. My was very good with a good amount of spiciness to it (they'll probably get complaints about that). But the Paradise Salad was anything but. It was supposed to be grilled chicken on a bed of greens - okay it was grilled chicken but was on a bed of raw cabbage. Then the menu calls for Mandarin oranges, apples, pineapple and pico de gallo. The one thing my husband was looking forward to was the pineapple. So he balked at the cabbage (I would have also), but then there wasn't a single piece of pineapple on the plate. We had a change in servers (at 12:00 Noon?) and didn't have an offer of refills on drinks or a ""How's the meal?"" after it was dropped off by a mystery food runner from the kitchen. So when the bill came, we told the waiter. The manager stopped by (and I don't think it was because the waiter told him) and asked how the meal was. We explained and he actually made the meal sound worse than it is -- like they dip a measuring cup into some big can of fruit mixture to toss with the salad. He also thought the orange/apple/pineapple mixture WAS the pico de gallo. They took it off the bill but we'll be looking for someplace new next time we go to the outlet malls. I also noticed that the ratings for the restaurant have either had a nosedive this year or because of the food and/or service, more people are adding reviews about their dissatisfaction. Too bad, because we used to go here whenever we were there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gilroy-6?start=240

Moved to another waiters section, and he forgot my credit card for the longest time! I hate these kinds of restaurants because it's an alcoholics innovation; that means someone with absolutely no taste buds decided to get in the food business once upon a time- don't expect good food, don't expect service!

Unfortunately the girl who was taking notes on how many needs to be seated isn't doing her job.
