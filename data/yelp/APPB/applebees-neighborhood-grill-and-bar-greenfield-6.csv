Chris F.,"Greenfield, MA",3,2,,2.0,1/8/2012,Ehhhh............ Chain restaurant what did you expect?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greenfield-6?start=20
Christy R.,"Brattleboro, VT",0,39,,2.0,2/3/2012,"Place is dusty, needs an update.  I agree with the others, 99 is better than this place. But I'd go to Taylors or a local before these chain restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greenfield-6?start=20
Rachel M.,"Greenfield, MA",0,8,,2.0,3/15/2013,"I don't know why I even bother.  I needed a fast meal for my daughter and I the other night.  I thought I would try the ""car side to go"".  The service was good and my food was fine.  The Mac and Cheese I ordered for my daughter was a joke.  It was no more then 1/2 a cup serving and I was charged $4.00.  When I got home and realized what I had been given it was too late.  No surprise my daughter was hungry after she finished her food and I still had to cook dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greenfield-6?start=20
Rue B.,"Montague, MA",10,114,3,2.0,5/30/2009,"These types of restaurants (Applebee's, Chili's, Friday's, Outback, etc.) make me sad - staple of strip malls, indicative of supposed suburban ""progress,"" located in the gray area between fast food and good food, typically a little over-pricey for what they are, and always inexplicably busy.  Always edible but never incredible.     This particular one is full of scary ski tourists in shiny SUVs from tri-state NY area and rumors of skiing celebrity sightings like Gwyneth Paltrow or something.   Located right off I-91 here in Franklin County forgotten fly-over country, this is one of the few places in Greenfield that benefits at all from the weekend mass migrations into and out of Vermont.  Poor Greenfield, you simply have too many real people and aren't artificially cute or boutique-y enough to draw in the moneyed folk - just watch them gas up at the rotary then crowd up Applebee's.  (Or ""Apple's"" as the burnt-out east-facing neon sign has recently labeled it.)      At least your friendly neighborhood microwave is somewhat cheap.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greenfield-6?start=20
Joseph S.,"Franklin, TN",0,3,,5.0,8/28/2017,"Had a 7oz grilled chicken with garlic mash potatoes and broccoli, for only 540 calories and $10 it was a win win for both my wallet and my body. 10/10",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greenfield-6
Nic D.,"Boston, MA",62,5,,5.0,12/19/2017,"I came to this location dec 19 around 6. I've had the lemon grilled chicken at atleast 7 different Applebee's and this was by far the best. Perfectly juicy and perfect portions of chicken to apple And rice. Sat at the bar and the bartender had a drink in my hand the second I thought about getting another one. Even the meal was delivered in under ten min, with a decent sized crowd. Amazing staff",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greenfield-6
Taylor H.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",17,9,2,5.0,1/17/2017,What I loved most about this Applebee's was the atmosphere. If I don't get enough sports at home with my husband I can come here and order the sweet potato fries. They come with 3 sauces one of which is a maple cream cheese dipping sauce I'm not big on dairy but this sauce was my fave. Bottomless chips were also a big hit in my book. I love Applebee's!!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greenfield-6
Dan R.,"East Falmouth, MA",103,1615,5633,5.0,7/12/2015,"Yesterday afternoon we had an early lunch at Applebee's and I have to say that we were thoroughly impressed with our overall experience. This restaurant has definetly improved over the past few months and below are a few of the highlights. 1. The atmosphere here is great. I love the fact that they got rid of all the silly sports memorabilia and made it a ""neighborhood grill.""  2. The staff here is incredible. The hostess was great, our waiter Ethan was incredible and the general manager was polite, available and checked in on our experience. 3. My wife and I had a blast playing trivia on their tablet. We love talking with one another, but this had us testing each other. 4. The food was quick and well made. We started with an appetizer sampler which came out in stages. This was great because it gave us time to pace ourselves. The entrées were also incredibly delicious. I had the Cowboy Burger while my wife had the quesadilla burger. In the end, kudos to this place and this past visit put Applebee's back on our radar for places to visit regularly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greenfield-6
Glenn J.,"Wallingford Center, CT",21,265,187,4.0,8/4/2014,"With many chain restaurants, the food is going to be pretty much the same at every location. What sets each one apart, is the level of service. I found the service at the Greenfield Applebee's to be very good.  We came here on a Friday night during the summer. It was busy, but there wasn't a wait. I believe we arrived around 7-7:30ish. The manager who sat us was very pleasant. He thanked us for coming in as we were seated. The waitress we had was friendly as well.  We hadn't been to an Aplebee's in quite sometime and the menu has been nicely updated. I went with a wrap; my wife a salad. The salad was pretty big! The wrap was nicely sized. We had the Brew Pub Pretzels for an appetizer. They were good. But I think they were fried...which was a little disappointing. Drinks, the app and the food all came out in a timely manner. We had a slight wait for a bill, but that was it.  Overall, a good experience here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greenfield-6
Stefan S.,"Fairfax, VA",241,465,116,5.0,10/15/2015,"Great, lively atmosphere, even after 8 pm on a weeknight.  Very quick and attentive service.  Jackie P. was an excellent waitress.  Always on the ball making sure everything was okay.  Offered to bring numerous refills of my ice tea, but only took one due to a long drive ahead.  Ordered right away as I was hungry and knew what I wanted.  Chicken Tortilla soup for an appetizer, very tasty and good flavor, not too spicy.  Then ordered the 9oz House Sirloin with fries and broccoli.  Cooked quickly and to order.  Steak was done perfectly and tasted great.  Fries were done just right and Broccoli was steamed without sauce or salt or anything else and was perfect.  I was offered dessert but declined due to the remainder of my drive.  All is all, nice, quick place with good food.  What more can you ask for when you are traveling.  Recommend you check this place out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greenfield-6
Nick U.,"Shelburne Falls, MA",0,6,4,5.0,7/1/2015,"My experience was at the bar.  Had Megan as a bartender.  She did an excellent job.  Friendly, but not too attentive.  Overall the restaurant was clean and food was good.  As chain establishments go, I would recommend this location to friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greenfield-6
Cassidy S.,"Greenfield, MA",0,7,,5.0,11/11/2015,Great food great service great people what else could you ask for. Applebee's is a wonderful little resturant. Very clean and very homey. I love the games they have available for people to play at the table.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greenfield-6
Ashley M.,"Brattleboro, VT",26,83,11,4.0,6/2/2014,"I still love this Applebee's. HOWEVER, What were they thinking by getting rid of the Pecan Crusted Chicken Salad?!!? It was my favorite!! :( Ps. Meghan is an AWESOME waitress and bartender. She makes my Perfect Patron just right!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greenfield-6
Robin M.,"Seymour, CT",0,5,1,5.0,7/29/2016,"Great service (kayla) and really good food.  We Had sweet potatoes, green goddess salad, and a few other dishes, all perfect.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greenfield-6
Thomas P.,"Everett, MA",1,2,,5.0,2/17/2014,"Never have I experienced the level of hospitality, comfort, and warmth at a restaurant. Over the course of a few hours I witnessed family's, friends, and acquaintances drink, dine, and mingle at this greenfield, ma Applebee's nestled in to the rolling hills and impressive canyons of the Mohawk trail.  Aptly named the neighborhood grill, the food is brilliant, beers are cold and women all have long legs and class. Don't stop in if you are in the greenfield area, get your group together and make this spot a destination of your dreams.  Signed...a hopeless romantic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greenfield-6
Brooke M.,"Amherst, MA",0,8,1,5.0,3/28/2015,"I have to leave an awesome review. My boyfriend and I have been regulars for years now, and have only gotten bad service one time when the restaurant was crazy! We love the half-priced apps after 9pm, and the wonderful waitstaff! They are incredibly friendly, accommodating, and experienced.  Our food is consistent, and the waitstaff is always wonderful! This Applebees right by home will NEVER lose our service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greenfield-6
Faine F.,"Greenfield, MA",26,28,17,1.0,12/13/2014,"Horrible horrible horrible! My steak was raw and had white stringy things within it!!! Gross. Supposed to have no mushrooms and French fries. Our waitress,  Aura, delivered my foods with mushrooms, I'm allergic. No French fries and when bright to get attention, tried to bring a coffee saucer of limp fries to it's, as we were wrapping up. They ended up charging us full price and did not deliver what was simply ordered off their menu. I will never go back and have passed on the word of mouth to all my friends, colleagues, and family to spare your time, money and effort for a more deserving establishment. Worst $60 ever sacrificed. Went home and ate cat food, it was yummy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greenfield-6
Dan S.,"Hartford, CT",268,934,116,2.0,9/5/2010,"We stopped  here on the way up to Vermont. As chain restaurants go, it's  somewhere below Chili's and 99 and above Friendly's. That's not saying a lot. Service is inconsistent - sometimes fast, sometimes slow. And the food is mediocre. Not awful, just so-so.  If you must stop in Greenfield, the 99 seems a bit better. But again, not saying a lot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greenfield-6
Brian T.,"Shelburne Falls, MA",15,23,,3.0,2/5/2014,Applebee's is consistent.   It has good service.  It's has seamed to change its menu up.  I always get the trio samplers.   It is easy with children.  They have a good menu for kids and quick service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greenfield-6
Clara S.,"Greenfield, MA",10,103,,5.0,3/26/2012,"I love it here! The bartenders and waitresses are talkative and friendly, and the food is always good. They are getting a remodel soon and are under new management. I hope they keep the Coors Light special. The Bahama Mama is really good too! Edit: Came here after the remodel on a Friday night. They were so busy and I was so impressed with Katie's service. Even though it was busy we had a perfect experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greenfield-6
Emily M.,"Greenfield, MA",10,12,,1.0,1/21/2016,"Went here for dinner and felt like I got robbed. Ordered a steak and asked if I could get a side salad instead of their potato side and was told no (any other restaurant would substitute this). I had to order a side salad separate. Got my meal and the steak was overcooked (asked for medium rare). It was literally the worst steak I have ever had. I could barely even chew it. Needless to say I ate 2 bites of it. My potato side was garlic mashed potatoes. I love garlic but these potatoes tasted awful. How do you screw up garlic mashed potatoes? They honestly tasted like they had dirt in them. My side salad consisted of about 6 pieces of lettuce, one cherry tomato, one piece of cucumber, one slice of pepper, and one slice of onion. I got my bill and they charged me $3.50 for that freaking salad. I was appauled. Every part of my meal was overpriced and awful. I wasn't expecting gourmet food but I was expecting reasonable prices which was always the case years ago and at least edible food. I will never return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greenfield-6
B A.,"Ponte Vedra Beach, FL",0,4,,4.0,12/31/2014,"Typical Applebee's. Good food, not excellent. The wonton chicken tacos were pretty good, the salmon wasn't great, specially when we got it with the cheese on top( service could be better. Megan was our waiter/bartender and wasn't really attentive. The place is ok, like any other chain restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greenfield-6
George T.,"New York, NY",0,20,,3.0,4/12/2013,Exactly what you'd expect from any Applebee's. Good cocktails. Poor selection for vegans unless you want salad. Vegan chili would be nice.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greenfield-6
Jimmy B.,"RIDGEWOOD, NY",15,189,5,3.0,4/21/2012,"Standard Applebee's fare. Not sure what else to say, if Applebee's is anything, it's consistent.  They don't take risks, and the samplings are usually decent. I opted for the Under 550 garlic sirloin this time and found it to be fantastic.  Cooked perfectly. Only negative was the price of a glass of unsweetened tea, I think it was like $2.50, but 'tis what 'tis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greenfield-6
