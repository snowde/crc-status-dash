Caroline L.,"Burlington, NC",0,18,,2.0,5/12/2015,"This is a terribly run chain restaurant.  My expectations are realistic when I go to restaurants in this category.  I don't expect fine dining, but when properly managed and staffed, these places should at least offer a smooth experience for their guests. I've been several times.  I should have stopped going sooner, but my boyfriend inexplicably continued to want to eat there, despite the bad experiences.  To be fair, the food isn't BAD, and it's on the very inexpensive side, even compared to other cheap chains. The service is slow and painful.  I've never had a rude server, they just seem completely inept.  It seems like a lack of training or something rather than the employees being truly ""bad.""   There's just a general sense of confusion.  Those game tablet things on the tables gross me out.  I don't think wiping them down is part of the cleaning rotation.  I haven't noticed a cleanliness problem with the restaurant itself or the dishes or anything, but the sanitation score is close to that border between comfortable and unacceptable. Their issues could easily be fixed, but clearly that's not a priority for the people running this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensboro-7
Alexa G.,"Kernersville, NC",14,273,13,1.0,12/10/2017,"Not too pleased with this particular location. Husband and I came here for some dinner and limited time one dollar Long Island Iced Tea. Once in, the hostess was nowhere near the front. Ok, kinda odd since it's a Sunday night and therefore not too busy. Took them like 10 minutes to seat us (eventhough once again not crowded on a Sunday night). Waitress then sat us down and ordered drinks. Got water first then about 5 to 10 minutes later our LIITs arrived. It's a dollar for a reason. Very little alcohol and enough sugar to wear out your teeth enamel. Thankfully I didn't spend more on that so called cocktail. I ordered a chicken sandwich and husband ordered a hamburger. Reading the menu, it stated that both of these items included tomato and lettuce. Plates arrived and neither are shown. Kindly asked another waitress to get them. Not sure what's the deal here, but I'm never coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensboro-7
Angela W.,"Greensboro, NC",0,7,3,1.0,3/19/2017,"The signs of this location was clear for years; however last night's service ended a tradition I must celebrate elsewhere. A good friend and I went out for Girls' Night Out only to end the night disappointed. Twenty minutes after ordering a Wonton dinner, my friend was told they ran out of Wonton. Applebee's running out of food on a main strip of Greensboro during March Madness weakened? How tacky! She ordered the WATERMELON Sangria only to taste more cranberry in an iced down drink. If you think her order was messed up only, guess again. I originally ordered the Blue Hawaiian LIT cocktail drink only to be told they ran out of a main ingredient earlier in the day. So, I ordered the Irish Peach Sour only to get a Bahama Mama instead. How can you mix up the two drinks? The Classic Trio snack combo arrived WARM. The nachos were on a metal tray from Grernsboro's jail house, and the cheese in the cheese sticks were barely warm. When my friend asked to speak with the manager on duty, we were stunned to see an attractive male in a flannel shirt appear as if he works on a farm instead. What happened to Applebee's dress code? I don't know what is going on at this location, but I can confirm I will no longer visit it. Mangement is a hot mess for certain!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensboro-7
Tim L.,"Dunedin, FL",0,2,,1.0,10/15/2017,Our waiter was great. Everyone else (besides the bartenders) were awful. Hostesses just stared at us when we walked in like we were bothering them. People just looked clueless!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensboro-7
Breanna M.,"Asheville, NC",118,13,8,4.0,4/18/2017,The service and food was great! Faith was my server and she was so kind and extremely meticulous! I would recommend this place to a friend. Thanks Faith for making sure me and my party were well taken care of!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensboro-7
Em H.,"Greensboro, NC",94,212,1624,4.0,6/4/2015,"My husband & I like eating here on occasion. The food is good & wait staff is usually on top of things. Keep in mind we usually eat around 6, before things get really busy. The Oriental chicken salad is a favorite & we like the spinach dip appetizer. The brownie bite is a good dessert. We will return again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensboro-7
Heather W.,"Arcata, CA",1,37,20,1.0,12/30/2015,"Don't eat here. The price isn't worth it. If you want mediocre service this is the place to go. I normally wouldn't write a review of a chain like this because lets be real; if you're eating here you either don't know what good food is or you were made to go here by someone else.  The Service was slow, and I'm very appalled at the price of such crappy food. I haven't eaten here since I was 18 years old and now remember why. I'm so baffled at how Applebee's can charge $2.99 for a drink? How do you charge that much money for a drink and there not be any alcohol in it? Seriously? We paid $49 for a meal that didn't even meet mediocre status. We ordered one appetizer, two entrees and one dessert and somehow that constituted $49 which you might as well say is $50. The food wasn't worth $20 but I would have felt better paying, at the most $30.  For the appetizer we had sweet potato fries (which shouldn't be an app but a side dish for maybe $3.50 not $5-$6). My boyfriend ordered 3 cheese chicken penne pasta and I ordered brisket enchiladas. Both were equally boring and tasted like a lean cuisine dinner. After I ate It I thought, ""is that it?"" The only thing that's worth eating at this restaurant is the Caramel Blondie dessert. That was great.  My suggestion: Only order the Blondie. Everything else, be prepared to be left hungry and confused.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensboro-7
Sun A.,"High Point, NC",39,42,431,1.0,4/7/2016,Usually their food is pretty decent but not tonight. Waited for about an hour and the food was still cold. Sent it all back. The bartender was awesome but I'm still hungry. Waited over 30 mins for soup and it came out warm sent it back! I'm bitter because I came after working starving now we are headed to Friday's. So much for a quick late dinner!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensboro-7
Chad C.,"Penryn, CA",24,29,65,1.0,1/12/2016,"Don't waste your money! The food is minimal portions for the amount you spend. I ordered the Mac & Cheese. It was runny and watery. When I asked the server for a side of Parmesan cheese, he told me they didn't have any. When I requested he asked the kitchen, they magically had parmesan? The chicken my partner ordered was incredibly dry. The happy our Long Island for $4 tasted off, and had very little alcohol. Honestly, the appetizer order of onion rings was the only food item we liked. I'll give them another chance down the road. I'm giving them 1 star for now. If you want a big meal for a great price, go to Texas Roadhouse!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensboro-7
Andrea P.,"Raleigh, NC",95,263,4,1.0,8/2/2014,"Needed a quick bite while out shopping, and made the mistake of coming here.   (-) The food was terrible.  My broccoli was still cold -- as in, I had the bartender touch it, and she exclaimed ""That's disgusting!"".  They brought me more, but I'd already lost my appetite. (-) A third of my 9oz sirloin was just a big, inedible, fibrous bit. (-) My waitress never refilled my water, never checked back to see how my meal was -- in fact, I had the broccoli replaced and she never knew/apologized for it - and introduced herself to us as ""multitasking"". I actually spoke with the manager and she was kind enough to comp the meal, but the damage was done - it was a completely unsavory experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensboro-7
Lisa S.,"Greensboro, NC",0,1,,1.0,8/3/2016,Terrible service..soooo slow and the bartender has an attitude. This place has no consideration regarding people time and expect you to wait on them all day long to serve you.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensboro-7
Monique Y.,"Winston-Salem, NC",3,3,,2.0,9/20/2015,While the food was decent the the alcohol  drinks had too much alchol. The  bartender had no idea how to make a drink. This restaruant chain will be out of business in a few years. Our sever was good that is why I am goving them 2 stars.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensboro-7
Sean T.,"High Point, NC",0,24,,2.0,8/28/2015,"I love their Steak and Shrimp Parmesan. We don't go there as often as we used to because they did away with the baked potato. I can get steaks with a baked potato just as good as Applebees at the Longhorn Steakhouse. Sad, it used to be one of my favorites.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensboro-7
Shelley J.,"Greensboro, NC",0,1,,1.0,4/10/2016,Ordered car side service. It said order would be ready at 1:37 and we arrived at 1:40. No one even came out until 1:51 and then it was just with the check and said food would be out. Why would you not come out when car arrived to greet and say food wasn't ready if that was the case. Instead we are left there so long we started to think we were supposed to go inside. Finally someone came out and didn't even apologize for the wait or anything. Ordered car side service a couple years ago and this same thing happened so never did it again until today and it's still the same bad service. If you can't provide a service the way it's probably meant to work you shouldn't offer it!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensboro-7
Sam N.,"Charlotte, NC",0,1,,1.0,8/3/2016,terrible slowwww service.  all I wanted was an appetizer and it took the server 18 minutes just to take my order. rediculous.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensboro-7
Danielle C.,"Sandy Ridge, NC",0,6,,1.0,1/18/2014,"Disgusting place, low 90's in sanitation and we found hair in our food. Would not recommend this place at all!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensboro-7
Jared S.,"Greensboro, NC",5,1,,1.0,1/6/2015,Food bad service bad never going back i dont recommend  it i had the dinner for 2 with my girfriend and it took forever to get our food when we got it my ribs were dry and so was the chicken not going back,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensboro-7
Danielle B.,"Raeford, NC",0,4,1,4.0,6/25/2014,"The food is always good here. The service is horrible at night (after 8pm), so I would definitely suggest eating here earlier in the day. The staff is friendly. Also, I LOVE the little tablets they have at every table. You can order and pay the bill from them. I especially like that you can call you server with them. Sanitation score was posted as 95%.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-greensboro-7
