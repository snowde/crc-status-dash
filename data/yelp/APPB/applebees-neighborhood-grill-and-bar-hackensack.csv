Keydi B.,"Elmwood Park, NJ",5,47,29,1.0,7/18/2016,I came to get a gift card for my great aunt for her 90 birthday.   They had NO plain gift cards except football or winter ones.  Unacceptable!   Go a local store for a gift card rather than coming here!  Do Not waist your time even with the $10 back promotion!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hackensack?start=20
Shreen S.,"Tenafly, NJ",146,48,5,1.0,12/20/2015,"Giving this Applebee's one star is being generous in my book.  I completely understand that this is, after all, an Applebee's and my expectations aren't high at all. That being said, this establishment is very poorly run as the servers don't even have enough decency to treat customers with a little respect. My waiter threw 3 straws at me when I asked for one. Then, after bringing my food, he joked that he forgot to add special seasoning and took it around the corner and came back (implying that he was going to spit in it). I understand he was joking but there's a thin line between being funny and doing your job. Especially when I waited about 40 minutes for my plate and completely lost my appetite.  Regardless of that situation, this place always disappoints. The service is always shitty, the workers are rude, and it's just awful food. It's never my first choice and I instantly regret agreeing to go as soon as I walk in through those doors.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hackensack?start=20
Mayra A.,"Union City, NJ",59,11,,1.0,9/24/2016,"If I could give it 0 stars I would, this is the worst Applebees I've ever been to. Worst service. I get home from work late, and decided to grab a bite to eat with the boyfriend, sat down right away, which was good, it took our server 20'minutes to get to us. I had to call the host over to ask if anyone was going to come over, he then took our drink orders.  I asked for a blackberry sangria, and it came out 40 minutes later, its ridiculous. I can only imagine how long it would take for our food to get to our table. I don't think anyone is managing this company or are too cheap to have more staff closing and paying more attention to the customers. I work at a restaurant and this wouldn't fly by my staff. This is horrible! I couldn't wait til I got home to write this review. So I'm doing it now as I wait for my food to come to my table and it's been already over an hour and that I've been here. Who is running this place ??  Never again. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS APPLEBEES!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hackensack?start=20
Jose T.,"Paterson, NJ",16,6,,4.0,8/29/2016,"The service is really good. My waiter, Justin, was very good at making sure we were comfortable and satisfied with our meal. However the one reason id give this review a 4 out 5 is because the fries were a bit stale. They didnt taste as good as i expected. I was there not too long ago and the fries were amazing that time. Doesn't mean im never going back. Just a heads up to the kitcen staff to work in the fries.

Nareefa Y.,"Englewood, NJ",11,20,8,4.0,1/2/2016,"Sadly it's a mixed bag when coming here, because of the inconsistencies and a lack of quality control. We usually take home food and were given uncooked rice or missing dressings. We normally sit at bar area, because we enjoy chatting with the staff. Over the course of three years, we have seems many different faces and made friends with a few of the bartenders. Our favorites are Cory and Matt, they always make out experience a pleasant and entertaining one.

Joe Y.,"Palisades Park, NJ",123,4,,1.0,8/17/2015,"Let me start with this- this is an applebees; expectations are NOT high. I expect prices to be cheap and food to be hastily made, even microwaved is acceptable. That's fair to expect from an Applebees, right? This review is based on 5 occasions of going back (you want to give them a chance right?) and I've had the same experience EVERY TIME. With that said, the things you expect to be actually acceptable are all bad. If you ask for waters to start off, expect not to get it until you ask them at least two more times as they pass by. Maybe they're going to the mountains to get the water, but aside from that, this basic task is always a complete fail. The food will be bad. Don't expect anything fantastic. But the 1 star is not for the food. It's for the service. Lol no one will go to applebees looking for good food. It's because you want some late night half price appetizers for cheap.  If you want the check, just assume that they are processing fresh wood into paper and hand printing your bill onto it, because it takes way too long. Don't expect the check the first time you ask for it. Ask for it maybe 2 or 3 times. Otherwise expect to sit there until they close.  This is basic stuff, Hackensack Applebees. The management need to better train their employees. We understand they're mostly high school kids- but this is just basic stuff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hackensack?start=20

Travis W.,"River Edge, NJ",0,2,1,1.0,8/4/2016,"My gf, her mom, and I went here for din din and when the waiter asked what we wanted to drink, my gf asked for a water and a vanilla shake, her mom ordered a martini thing I think, and I asked for a coke (nothing too fancy) but the waiter smiled and replied with ""we have Pepsi"". DO YOU THINK THIS IS A GAME?! I asked ""do you have Sprite? And the waiter replied ""no, but we have Sierra Mist"". SIERRA FRIGGEN MIST. Do you want to die sir? I then stated ""I'll have a water"".

Joanna R.,"New York, NY",7,8,3,2.0,6/1/2015,I rarely review a franchise but part of why you visit a franchise is because you know what to expect but the consistency of this franchise in comparison to others is mediocre.   This Applebee's is always a very frustrating experience which is unfortunate since my apartment is literally within walking distance. I have dined inside on two occasions where they have literally run out of cups for water. I also have a friend who dined on a separate occasion from those two times who complained of the exact same issue. The fact that this has happened on three separate occasions is not a service issue- it's a management issue. I hope that they will read this review and address this very bizarre issue that I promise is a very cheap and easy fix. My next frustrations came with takeout. Both times I have ordered takeout from this particular Applebee's they have failed to start preparing my food prior to my arrival. The first time I called in and placed my order over the phone. When my boyfriend arrived at the expected pickup time they admitted that they hadn't started the order. The reason I never previously reviewed them was due to the fact that the manager comped one of our apps and I felt like it was a reasonable accommodation. Tonight I placed an order for pickup through online ordering and when I arrived on site while the employee was very nice and polite it was obvious that again my order hadn't been started even though this was my pickup time. My food was promptly started but I now know that I just really can't rely on my food being ready on time at this location. Overall this location is run down and outdated in comparison to other Applebee's locations. This probably won't be my last time visiting this Applebee's but it is only out of convenience and the fact that I like the food. The reality is that I will continue to choose other local dinning options while visiting this specific franchise less frequently than I otherwise would if it was more on par with the standard that has been set by other Applebee's locations I have visited. If I could give a 2.5 I would but this place just doesn't deserve a 3 star review. Hopefully they can work on some of the things I mentioned in my review and eventually when I give them another chance in the future and at that time I'll adjust my rating but for now they've got some things to tweak.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hackensack?start=20
Lex B.,"Manhattan, NY",36,13,8,1.0,4/25/2015,"This Applebees used to be my favorite late night spot all through my high school years and college. However, as of lately, it seems like management could care less of about their employees and the type of people serving their loyal customers.  In short, the service is beyond terrible. Expect to wait before getting seated (even when it's empty), expect to wait for utensils and getting your order taken, expect to wait for your mediocre food and expect to wait for the waiter to get your bill. The last time I visited I asked for a plate and the waitress picked her ear and grabbed an unused plate from a table they were cleaning out because she didn't want to walk to the back. Disgusting.   Tonight was my last straw. For starters, they took forever to get seated and to get our orders taken so we left. As we exited, a young waiter with long unwashed curly hair  sporting a stupid bandana sarcastically said, ""That was quick I hope you enjoyed your food"". Are you kidding? Instead of kindly asking us what went wrong, he decided to make a rude comment to completely turn us off from ever giving this place another chance.  Applebee's, get your business together. We went to Miller Ales after this with no regrets.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hackensack?start=20

Bart L.,"Dumont, NJ",6,85,,2.0,8/28/2016,"OK, while it is not quite bad enough to rate 1 star (which, for me, requires awfulness above and beyond simple neglectfulness), it comes close. I've been to other Applebee's, and found them to be decent as far as chain restaurants go, but, even though we give this place a chance every 2-3 years (pretty much after every time we have a pleasant experience at another Applebee's), it always disappoints. Some problems are based on the kind of restaurant it is (unsupervised children screaming and running around), but we have experienced problems from ""Would you like some food with your salt?"" to getting several pieces of tableware with encrusted dirt which, when brought to the manager's attention, we were unable to get the message across that it was something that she might consider being concerned about.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hackensack?start=20

Ina M.,"Hackensack, NJ",330,379,820,1.0,9/24/2014,"If this could get negative stars, I would give negative stars. I try and try again to at least like this place, but it just always disappoints. Okay, before I go on with this, I am not hard to please (I easily give 4-5 stars). Just give me a drink and put in the food order and we will be best friends. I work in the same industry and I totally understand we get busy with other tables, but to go around a table and making it obvious you don't wanna take us is just rude, especially if we have to wait 10-15 minutes just to get greeted. Just say ""Give me one second and I will be with you"" is enough for me to know you acknowledged my presence. Every time I attempt and give a chance to this place, my boyfriend puts a timer on and it seriously takes us 10-15 minutes to get greeted. That is not the worst thing yet. So I come in with friends and have more on their way. We get sat quick, but takes forever for a server to greet us. So the rest of our friends come in 30 minutes before closing. The host greeted them by saying, ""you know we are closing in 30 minutes right."" And my friends were puzzled and said we""ll make it quick. I honestly felt bad that the rest came so late and the kitchen was about to close and the restaurant was about to close and we were still there. I ACTUALLY FELT BAD AT FIRST. But after the host came to our table and said ""well if you plan on ordering food, you have to go to the bar and order..and you gotta make it quick."" I was shocked. If I were to say that to a guest, I would've gotten fired on the spot. I felt disrespected. So fine we go to the bar to join our friends that ordered food. I was just so heated that I asked for a manager. Well, that was a mistake. I talked to him and it was not going anywhere. He even said ""but I don't understand how hard it is for you to get up from your table to the bar and just order."" I was even more shocked. Like I just lost respect for this place. I told him if he wanted to say sorry at least act like you mean it and he's just like, ""but I don't know what else you want me to say..I am saying sorry!""  I decided to leave, and my friends that stayed to wait for their food said that they heard that manager talking crap about the situation amongst the employees. Who knows.  If you want to go to a good spot, go to the Applebee's in Paramus (I do get busy servers, but I absolutely love that one 10000000000x more! Service is better, and managers are great. They actually know how to approach guests. I have been to the one in Garfield once, and I got good service too (could have been because our server was the boyfriend of a friend, but regardless, everyone in that Applebee's were so much better).  Drink tip: And if you're there too, never get a margarita here. They just taste like pure sour (could be due to their company recipe).

Daniel M.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",137,6,3,1.0,3/31/2017,"Such an outright shitty experience. First off, the Host was looking at us all weird and we were not feeling in. Secondly, our server took 15 minutes to ask for our fucking drinks. I ordered the Honey Blackberry Quencher Tea and this bitch put ONE fucking BLACKBERRY IN IT. Then, I ask for extra ranch with my wings...where it @ doe. So I ask her coworker...where it at though. She comes by to ask how's everything. I ask for ranch...where it at though. She comes back again. Where's my ranch!? Then she brings it. Then we trying to pay and this bitch was so shitty. We wanted to pay half card on iPad and half cash and she didn't even help us or explain shit when the iPad crashed, and it got to a point where I didn't feel like waiting to pay cash, so I paid with my card. Even when she came back from her hibernation in the kitchen, she didn't even have that check that I initially ASKED HER FOR. Gowa, this just ain't for you.

The Critical J.,"Cresskill, NJ",65,97,,4.0,7/26/2017,"PROS: They have the friendliest wait staff you'll meet. They're clean, there's a lot to choose from on the menu, the prices are good, and there are tablets by every table to play games on and to check your meal out. The servers are knowledgeable about the food, and they have an open bar with many tvs for the game. They even hire the mentally handicapped for bus boy positions, that way they can gain some work experience. I think that's very nice of them. CONS: Applebees is very slow at bringing out your food. Also, when they're busy, they don't turn over tables fast enough which causes the waiting time for people coming in to increase. Another thing that I don't like is that they don't check up on you regularly. My glass was starting to collect dust before my server asked if I wanted another one. OVERALL: This is a great Applebees to go to.

Barry F.,"Secaucus, NJ",2,5,,1.0,6/14/2015,"Went to this Applebees a few days ago with a friend.  We sat at the bar in the early afternoon for some beers and lunch.  The bar was not crowded at all maybe four other people there.  The service was absolutely horrible.  The bartender came to take our drink order after we already been sitting for several minutes and had the attitude that we were bothering him on this lazy afternoon.  He gave us our menus and forgot about us.  He never came back to ask if we wanted to order and finally we needed to flag him down and ask if we could order appetizers.  We gave him our order and the appetizers came out promptly however the bartender had assumed that my friend wanted a small plate combo instead of the two full size orders.  This is not a giant deal but he should have asked what option my friend wanted.  The food was fine no issues there but after receiving our appetizers we were once again forgotten.  The bartender must have assumed we were done however I was interested in ordering an entree.  We waited for over twenty minutes to see if Mr. Personality would ask if we were ok.  He never asked if we would like another round of drinks or if we wanted to order any other food.  He then brought the check over without us having asked for it.  Now I realize that at Applebees they put the check in a glass in front of you and update it when you order but this guy plopped it right in front of us.  Well at this point I as fed up with the horrible attitude from this guy so I paid the check and his tip was zero.  I have never in my adult life tipped someone nothing.  I frequent other Applebees on occasion and have never had such a bad experience.  Save yourself the aggravation if you walk in and Ben is behind the bar just leave.  I don't know abut the rest of the staff, they may be awesome, but I will never be back to find out.  Applebees management you probably lost out on double or triple of amount of what my bill was including beers and instead I went to popeyes so sad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hackensack?start=60

She didn't take our menus away, didn't bring out our food or our drinks (they were brought out by other people) and when we requested lemons she's kept us waiting fifteen minutes. She took our order, brought a single glass of water to the table and then disappeared to get the lemons. In the meantime our food and my drink from the bar was brought over by another server. When she came out of the kitchen 15 minutes later with no lemons, we watched as she approached two other tables- bigger tables with more people and thus capable of giving her a bigger tip- and ignored us. Upon seeing our faces, before we even said anything she came over and said angrily, ""you have to give me a minute okay, I just got a four top and six top and I have to help them. I'll get your lemons in a minute."" Then she rolled her eyes and shook her head, it was behind my friends back but I was facing her and could see her clearly. When she walked by I told her we needed plates, napkins, straws and the rest of our order which hadn't made it out of the kitchen and she started looking at me like I had three heads, I added in that I realized she was busy but I saw her roll her eyes and she's not invisible- she just walked away! Unbelievably rude- the manager then came over with our lemons and in front of the manager and VERY loud she goes, ""Oh and I'm not serving this table anymore!"" I would have fired her on the spot- all the other guests were just staring at her and I just felt so much pity for her. How pathetic it is to be a grown adult and not be able to control yourself in front of other people. Not to mention it's her job- the manager was polite and he apologized but I really felt like no patron should have to sit through that- oh and to top it off the waitress put in the wrong order for us she gave us chicken nachos which I believe is more expensive and not what we asked for- we wanted regular nachos.  This was a frequent hang out place for a few of my friends, but every time we go now it just gets worse and worse. We go for the late night apps/drinks and almost always the server's are rude. Mostly this is because I usually go with only one or two other people and a ten dollar check isn't going to yield a big tip. So the servers are money hungry but I've had experiences where I've had to call a manager over. The one manager, James is nice, very apologetic and accommodating, but he's fighting a losing battle with unprofessional and downright rude staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hackensack?start=60

Yes, the chain every American is familiar with and probably the basis for the whoever wrote that movie ""Waiting"", starring Ryan Reynolds. Overpriced drinks and mediocre food still seem to bring in a lot of people here.

After 10 pm. And pay 1/2 for the appetizers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hackensack?start=40
Victoria G.,"Paramus, NJ",0,3,,1.0,11/7/2015,Wish I could give this location 0 stars. Service is TERRIBLE. They couldn't even bring us plates for our appetizers and it took them 30 mins to get us our drinks. Never coming back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hackensack?start=40
Thomas V.,"New Milford, NJ",2,2,1,2.0,1/25/2015,"I came to this restaurant after church. I was seated almost immediately. A waiter came by and took my order for drinks. Then I didn't see him again. Thankfully Thomas, another waiter came to my rescue. He was courteous and polite. He took my order for Bourbon street steak and root beer. The order came in about ten minutes, pretty good since I had ordered medium well. The steak was a little too salty for my taste. The waiter came and enquired how I liked the food. The manager also came by. The overall experience was ok but the quality of the food was average. I think this Applebee's is trying to improve, my previous experience to this place was nothing to brag about. I might go back in another six months.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hackensack?start=40
Ben F.,"New Milford, NJ",162,122,103,3.0,1/18/2013,"This is definitely one of the friendlier and down to earth Applebee's. The servers will stop and chat with a table. Plus, they actually have opinions on the food, they will tell you what they recommend and don't recommend. I like when they do this based on experience and not the price point. Which our server did. He was very knowledgeable and helped my friend--who had never been there before--navigate the menu.  The apps are delicious and the prices aren't crazy. There's usually something for everyone.  It can get a little crowded/noisy but you get what you pay for. Enjoy the environment. Bring some friends. It's a good place to unwind for less than one would pay at a NJ or NY bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hackensack?start=40
