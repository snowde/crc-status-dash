Tatiana W.,"Little Falls, NJ",47,76,93,4.0,2/13/2015,"I really enjoyed my lunch here today! Had the lunch combo of the French onion soup and half a Classic Grill sandwich for $8.99. The soap was very hot in temp, exactly the way I like it! It was very tasteful in flavor as well. The sandwich was also delicious.  I topped it all of with the $1 Brownie Bite which just the perfect size! It had a small scoop of vanilla ice cream and hot chocolate sauce drizzled over it and the brownie piece which had pecans. Highly recommend this combo! And the service was very accommodating as well! The manager Melissa came by to check on me as did my server Beth several times . Very pleased!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hackettstown
Gabrielle V.,"New York, NY",474,57,241,4.0,1/20/2017,"Always a great place for Half Apps at 10 PM! They have live music during the week, Wednesday night specials, ladies night and half priced appetizers every night! It can't get any better than that! I always love coming here and seeing old friends. It's always a high school reunion. The staff is friendly and the bartenders know you by name! Definitely try the sangrias and Bahama Mama after 10. Half priced drinks too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hackettstown
Diego O.,"Elizabeth, NJ",0,1,,2.0,7/21/2017,"Came here with a few buds after a long day of work to get a quick bite and was very disappointed. There was no hostess so we sat ourselves, and waited...to the point We were wondering maybe they were about to close but weren't. Then our server finally showed up, and he didn't seem very enthusiastic about doing his job, needless to say the service was not prompt. We asked for a couple of drinks and water. Our drinks came but the water never did, we placed our order and continued waiting for water. We asked another employee for water and then our food came. We then again asked for water to the bartender which we got instantly. The food was good, our server never came to check on us...we were almost done with our food and our server finally showed up, did not ask how our food was, he showed up to see if we were done with our dinner. We then decided to ask for the check because now we feel a little rushed, and now I just feel like I want to get out of there asap. I probably won't ever be back here, I get people have bills to pay and there are a million places you'd rather be than stuck working at Applebee's but at least do your job and pick up our empty plates. The check came and our pile of plates remained on the table. We still tipped 20% but will think twice about spending my money here again. Our server also seemed a little arrogant and flaunted he's in medical school but after seeing his job performance I would highly advice a career that doesn't involve putting work or take care of other people, I don't think I'd trust this guy as my nurse. Good luck Justin!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hackettstown
Iris K.,"Bronx, NY",4,24,13,3.0,7/5/2015,The waiter was good - though I don't want anyone badgering me every few minutes  how is everything folks... The condiment holders need to be wiped down after the table is bussed--- dirty salt and paper jars  watery steak sauce - ketchup bottle not clean Table  cleaners need to do thorough cleaning seats table and condiments. Food was good not very salted since I asked for no sodium  Ask for sugar free tea with favors. Sweet has tons of sugar,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hackettstown
Laura S.,"Blairstown, NJ",48,13,,5.0,4/10/2016,"Good food at a great price. We usually get the oriental salad off the two for $20 menu. It is positively addictive. Lots of crunch, plenty of flavor and the oriental dressing is perfect. I tried to make it at home, but it wasn't nearly as good. Wait staff is good, but come to the table a little too often. French onion soup is delicious also; but how can you go wrong with French onion soup?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hackettstown
Amanda S.,"Smyrna, GA",0,15,2,5.0,10/19/2015,"I've never had a complaint about this Applebee's. The manager walks around greeting people at there tables which gives the feeling that they really do care about their service. Also, the food and drinks are great!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hackettstown
John A.,"Hackettstown, NJ",0,14,7,1.0,10/26/2014,"Terrible meal. My wife order a bacon cheeseburger and I ordered a turkey bacon avocado club sandwich.  The bacon on both sandwiches was burned and the beef patty for the burger was overlooked, dry, and cold.  The fries that came with the meal were cold and withered. My sons cheese quesadilla was cold.  This has been one of the worst meals my family has had and with a hefty price tag close to $50.  Which is very high price for a hamburger, turkey sandwiches, cheese quesadilla, fries and 3 beverages.  Definitely not worth the money or time spent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hackettstown
Isidora R.,"Long Valley, NJ",20,5,2,3.0,11/14/2014,I came with my friend and we ate the 2 plates for $20. My friend asked for the chicken tenders basket and was nothing. Like 10 fries and 3 tiny tenders. She can actually pay  the same plate for $6-7 or even the same plate from the kids menu. Julia was our server and she never took our plates and appetizer from the table until we left. Love this plate but needs a little bit of more attentions on the table,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hackettstown
Julia L.,"New York, NY",269,313,19,3.0,12/10/2012,"Upon arriving in a small town in New Jersey, the hip spot to go the night before Thanksgiving, or any night for that matter is this chain called Applebees.  Being from a small town myself, where we have bars, I must say that I was a bit shocked, but was also pretty excited to experience Applebees in this part of the country. It was actually pretty good - considering we just had lots of drinks and some shots. In addition to this, there was also a trivia game going on. We didn't do too terribly, but it was still a nice thing to do on a busy night before the holiday.  It's obvious that there are a lot of locals that go here and it is the hip spot for people to go, chill, have a couple drinks and vibe with people. I'm sure there are bars around where you can have that type of atmosphere, but for a preholiday evening - this place is perfect.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hackettstown
Henry K.,"New Brunswick, NJ",0,23,,3.0,3/21/2013,Typical applebees. One of the few places in the area to be open late so it gets kind of busy at night. Been there many times and haven't had a significantly bad experience yet so that's something. Had the potato twisters last time and they didn't quite agree with me but that's about it in terms of complaints.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hackettstown
