John H.,"Hamilton, OH",5,113,15,4.0,1/6/2018,Very good experience considering I had low expectations. We had a party of 12 and the food and service were both really good. I enjoyed the salmon with broccoli. Not a big fan of Applebee's in general but I would go back to this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hamilton-3
Mark M.,"Mesa, AZ",80,40,14,1.0,10/15/2015,Took my daughters there a couple of months ago while visiting Miami of Ohio University. Horrible experience. Horrible food. Horrible service. I would eat out of a dumpster before I ever go back there again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hamilton-3
Karen N.,"Hamilton, OH",0,1,,1.0,12/9/2015,"This place is a joke. Took a job for extra money. After starting i saw herion users with still fresh marks . Kitchen is nasty! One cook had dip in his mouth the whole night, with spit cup sitting on work station near food. Its known for hiring dope heads . No one weaars gloves, also alochol being consumed by employees! Health dept. needs to shut it down and clear out the drug users.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hamilton-3
Austin C.,"Hamilton, OH",1,9,1,2.0,1/12/2015,"fly is flying around my dish the last time I went. This time, it gets a little better, perhaps it's because of the cold weather that flys don't come out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hamilton-3
Stephen S.,"Fairfield, OH",0,2,,2.0,7/8/2014,"After a one-year boycott of this restaurant I decided it go back. It was after their remodeling and for the fact that my son wanted to go. The service and food was so bad before that I had to boycott it . With that said, I actually enjoyed it last night. The remodeling is nice with the open layout . You can actually see all the TVs now. And all the old dust collecting stuff on the walls is gone. The service was much better and food was actually pretty good although I stuck to the appetizers. My wife seemed to enjoy her chicken dish.. I will go back again and if it's good, I might give it another star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hamilton-3
Pat V.,"Hamilton, OH",16,11,,1.0,3/20/2015,"We went to Applebee's at 4:11PM for dinner on a Thursday.  The restaurant had a few customers.  We asked for a booth, but the hostess at the door said there were none available.  I could see four empty booths up two steps  right near door.  I asked why those couldn't be used.  Her answer was that section was not open, though I could see 4 tables in that area occupied.  After pointing that out, the hostess said the tables across from the booths were not in the same section and could not be used until 5 PM.  We are in our 70's.  The chairs are hard and not comfortable.  We left this Applebee's and won't return.  We are locals and there aren't lots of choices. Too bad Applebee's has such limited seating practices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hamilton-3
David R.,"Hamilton, OH",1,5,,1.0,5/22/2013,We just had a terrible experience here. After waiting nearly an hour for our food. My wife's food chicken and fries were cold. I had my sister in from Arizona and her hamburger was not done at all on the inside. The last 2 times I have been at this location there have been problems. On a scale of 1 to 10 I give it a 2 at best. I will go to the Applebee's on the east side of Hamilton from now on I will not go to the one on the west side.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hamilton-3
Benjamin W.,"Hamilton, OH",55,180,13,4.0,7/7/2011,"As far as Applebees goes, this one is pretty good for chain. I don't often eat in the restaurant, and usually get ""To Go"" orders. I've never had a complaint about the service or the speed of the food coming out, and only occasionally have an issue with my order being wrong. What I like about this location is that they are very accommodating of special orders. I like extra dressing with my salad, and they never fail to take care of me. Usually we get Applebees on the way home from the barn, and so we come up with some pretty strange orders since we want specific things when we're tired. Not a problem for this location. They will customize the heck out of our order without batting an eye. I think very highly of the service at the bar. Sometimes, we have to come in and get our order from the bar. The bartenders are always paying attention and they don't slack in the least. When we get there a few minutes early, they usually have our order ready, and if not, they get it together very quickly. I've gone through a couple of bartenders, but they hire quality staff at this location. If you're in the area and craving Applebees, check this one out. It's worth the stop.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hamilton-3
Kara K.,"Columbus, OH",18,277,,2.0,11/22/2010,"I came here almost once a week throughout high school.  Now I've moved away from Hamilton & rarely go to Applebee's (this location or otherwise).  Hamilton doesn't have many options for sit-down dining after 10pm, so the BF, his family, & I ended up here.  We unknowingly walked in to UFC night.  There's definitely a market for it as the restaurant was packed, but so obnoxious.  We asked to be seated away from the TVs in an effort to avoid the insanity.  We were unsuccessful.  Our dinner was interrupted by much screaming the UFC watchers.  The waitress also seemed distracted by the TV as she forgot to bring a milkshake to the table & was slow on the refills.  Food is mediocre & boring.  Skip Applebee's, go to a local place like Walt's or Ryan's.  I wish we had.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hamilton-3
