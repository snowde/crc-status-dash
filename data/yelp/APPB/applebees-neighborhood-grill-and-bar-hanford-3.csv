Susan M.,"Hanford, CA",0,1,,4.0,10/6/2017,"Leaving Applebee's very satisfied! To start the hostess who sat us was extremely friendly and very prompt, I believe his name was Joey.  I felt like we waited a decent amount for a Friday night! Our server was straight and to the point which I prefer when eating out! Joey came by occasionally to clear our plates which is really nice because I hate a cluttered table! Drinks were good! Will definitely be back, keep up the good work!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hanford-3
Ken B.,"Hanford, CA",4,27,1,1.0,6/28/2017,"I never really have very high expectations of restaurants like Applebee's. About the best thing you can say is that they tend to be reliably similar.  In Hanford you have very limited choice unless you want Mexican or Chinese so we wind up at this Applebee's several times a month. In the past I would have probably rated this one two, at best three stars. The foods reliable and the service is okay. However on our last two visits I've been pretty disappointed.  I admit my preferred cocktail is a Manhattan. Pretty simple, bourbon or whiskey, sweet vermouth, and a few shakes of bitters sometimes. A few weeks ago I ordered my manhattan as usual but shortly the waitress returned to inform me that they were out of sweet vermouth. When I expressed my surprise that they had run out of something that used to be a bar staple she said, ""oh, I don't think we're ordering it anymore, it's kind of old fashioned. "" she asked what I would like instead and I declined a substitute cocktail. Now a bottle of sweet vermouth retail is something like $7.00-8.00 dollars. Probably $5.00-6.00 for Applebee's and it has a pretty long shelf life. I told the waitress I hoped they would change their mind and once again stock it. Two nights ago I returned. I ordered a manhattan and was once again informed that they no longer stock sweet vermouth.  We may go back, I really don't know, but not stocking a five dollar bottle of vermouth fells like they really don't care and so I wonder why I should care about them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hanford-3
A V.,"Fresno, CA",145,11,2,1.0,12/18/2017,"Coming here is hit & miss. Somedays the workers are ok, most days they're horrible. They take forever to seat and serve you.

Jeanete O.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,1,1.0,10/7/2017,"Had to try the dollar margarita special for the month of October , I honestly haven't been to an Applebee's chain in over five years for a reason , and that reason was for the horrible food they used to have for a very long time on the menu , since then my husband and I decided to try it out again and sure enough the food is still horrible my husband had a pasta dish that had breaded chicken strips and macaroni and the strips were glazed with a sweet sauce well it was literally like eating a pancake with an overload of syrup , and I had a garden salad with chili vinaigrette and i had to order ranch instead and even then it was probably the worst garden salad ever it was not fresh at all it seemed like they just opened a bag of lettuce and threw it on a plate !

Samantha M.,"Lemoore, CA",3,27,7,1.0,2/20/2017,"My grandmother was in town visiting and since we'd gone to Chili's a couple times already we thought we'd go to Applebee's (my husband and I hadn't been to one in years).  Our waitress was pretty rude. Not friendly, not one smile, wasn't happy. I understand that working in a restaurant isn't the highlight of anyone's day, but good customer service is important whether you're having a good day or not.  My grandmother ended up not liking a part of her dish and told the waitress and she just said, ""I'm sorry"" then walked away. There wasn't a ""Can I get you something else?"" ""Do you want to replace it?"" Just a monotone ""I'm sorry."" ...okay...lol Food isn't spectacular, average at best. Service wasn't great.

Elizabeth C.,"Brentwood, CA",1,3,,1.0,8/23/2017,"First, our server Terry was great. Unfortunately it ended there. My friend and I ordered chicken and steak respectively. We ordered baked potato and Mac n cheese as sides. The sides were cold. Notified Terry who promptly informed the manager and brought us warm potatoes. The manager never even bothered to speak to us. My steak was ordered medium but was very rare and I was only able to eat around the edges.  Was reluctant to send it back because I simply didn't want to bother Terry and it was apparent the manager simply did not care. Also the salt and pepper containers on the table were both empty. Very poorly managed store. The only star is for Terry.

Susie Q.,"Fresno, CA",1,38,2,1.0,12/27/2016,"I thought I would give the Hanford one a try, since I had had two horrible experiences in Fresno and thought perhaps it was just the city!! Boy, was I wrong. In Fresno, I received racist waiters/waitresses and terrible customer service. In Hanford, I received amazing customer service and my waiter was so nice and efficient. His name eludes me at the moment, but blue eyes and blonde hair and super friendly.  He was the only highlight of my night, for being so funny and courteous. On to the food,  it was bland and dry.  I ordered the shrimp stir fry and my rice was basic, no sauce or flavor.  Pretty sure all of the food was cooked separately because it looked lumped one on top of the other and it had no flavor at all, but I was straving and thought I'll just eat this and never come back again.  That; however,  was not the worst part. As I get towards the end of the dish,  there was a tag paper receipt in my food!! I just sat there thinking,  glad I didn't eat it. I informed my waiter and he said he would tell the manager,  but no one ever came back,  as I shall NEVER come back. The whole chain sucks.

We had to get our service from other members of the waitstaff. Which I'll give kudos too, thank you to them for tending to us all the while our waitress was just walking around pretending to work. We hit the ""call button"" on Presto machine and I'm not exaggerating when I say 30min had gone by before I had to ask for the Manager on duty.

Jonathon W.,"Fort Bragg, CA",86,19,13,1.0,5/12/2016,"Wife and two boys and I went here the other day.  No one was at the front desk, but about 3-4 from the bar area/register closest to the restroom seen us and didn't bother to come up to the front desk.   I started to find the phone number to call and let them know we were waiting and someone came up before I could find the #.  It was the manager who came up to the front desk, he did say hi, or sorry, he said, ""how many?"" And then proceeded to speak with a employee, which meant we had to wait again.  Long story short.   My burger was extra greasy. The server Derek seemed as if he was in a hurry, even though it was pre dinner rush. His manners/service skills need to be fine tuned.  My boys and wife did not complain about their food.  We were only here cause we had received a gift card.  We normally don't choose Applebee's. You'll get better service and apparently a better burger at a fast food joint as well.  APPLEBEES.  YOU HAVE A VERY LOW STAR SCORE.  WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO CHANGE THIS?   When buffalo wild wings opens you'll be in a run for your money...

Q N.,"Hanford, CA",6,62,92,4.0,6/6/2016,"The delightful aroma of a wood burning grille in use greeted me as my wife and I walked from the car to the door of Applebee's. Skeptical of their recent advertising campaign touting their new menu with entrees prepared on their new wood fired grille, we were there armed with a birthday gift card from my daughter & family, and we're ready to put them to the test.  Their new grilled pork chop with honey Apple chutney looked great on the menu picture and I opted for that. I also chose the sides which were pictured with it - garlicky green beans and mashed sweet potatoes wit some kind of maple pecan sauce.  I was not disappointed. The meal looked exactly like the picture which is unusual in today's food advertising. My wife ordered a Thai themed shrimp salad that also was excellent.  Service was good - timing, considering the wood fired grille doesn't have a micro wave in it was good also. Prices were fair.  The whole experience was above average for a chain restaurant - hence 4 stars.

Bad idea. Change it back. Makes the glass sticky and needed a wet wipe to clean my hands. My French onion soup had a couple of chunks of meat (apparently chicken) in it, also too much cheese.

The food was forgettable and it was clear that Applebee's was going down hill, WAY down.  Consequently I avoided Applebee's at all costs for almost the next ten years- until a month ago.  I was taking my 5 year old out on a mom/son date and he wanted lunch.  Our choices were slim and I couldn't do another meal at ""old McDonald's"" so I thought- ""what the heck, one more shot"".  We went to the Hanford, California Applebee's.  I have to say, they redeemed themselves.  Our waitress was a joy and the food tasted good- with real seasonings like herbs and spices- not just salt and pepper.  So we went again about three weeks later and again it was really good- even though our waitress the second time was about as warm as Meryl Streep's character in The Devil Wears Prada.    So, tonight we went for the third time and THIS is why Applebee's is only getting 2 stars: We waited a bit to be seated which was understandable because they were packed.  Several people walked out.  The host (who was arguably one of the most irritating personalities I've met in a long while) called my 2 1/2 year old a ""baby"" and he got upset- because ""he's a big boy"".  The waitress was OK.  She forgot to bring us napkins FOREVER and we had to ask for silverware AFTER our food arrived.  Then we were finally eating and BOOM!  A hostess walks by and bumps my shoulder dropping an armful of half eaten food and plates on the floor and spilling the food from such plates all over my part of the table, my dress, and me- and my iphone- which ended up covered in salsa.  I can immediately tell she is mortified and having a terrible day.  She apologizes profusely and says she is so embarrassed.  Bro- at this point I'm not even mad.   What made me upset was the fact that SEVERAL of her team members walked by WITHOUT HELPING her.  The manager just stood against the back wall about 20ft away and watched her awkwardly try to clean it all up- as if she were a child thrown into a pool and he was waiting to see if she would sink or swim.  I helped and assured her it was cool.  No worries.  After it's all cleaned up the manager walks over and talks to us- nice guy- and apologizes and asks how our dinner is and we tell him everything is ok.  Our waitress asks if I like the food I ordered and I tell her it's not my favorite.  They graciously bring me a replacement item (which was very nice of them).  It was a steak salad- which I had ordered before and loved.  Well- this time 50% of the pieces of steak (there were 4) were all fat and the salad did not have the same deliciousness previously experienced.  So now I'll never order that again because the second time around it was again- forgettable.  Anyway, I still felt bad for the hostess and was terribly disappointed that no one offered to help her even though several servers and bussers walked right past her- stepping around her as she scrambled to clean it all up.  The crazy irritating host even stopped to watch and assumedly gossip about the situation with the manager as he stood by watching the spectacle as well.   So disappointed.  When I left I told the hostess it was not big deal and gave her $10.  I know what a bad day is like.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hanford-3?start=20

Daray J.,"Northridge, Los Angeles, CA",10,3,,2.0,5/27/2016,I was in town recently and decided to go have a few drinks at Applebee's with my family..HUGE MISTAKE! I was quoted 10 minutes for a table for 6 turns out to be a 25 min wait. This really isn't a huge deal I understand the restaurant business and they were probably understaffed. So while I'm waiting I decide to grab a beer from the bar it literally took the bartender Jen 7 minutes to even acknowledge I was there ! She was getting drinks for all of her regulars and then decided to ask me what I wanted. At that point I was over it but decided to be a good sport about it and just ordered my beer. It took her another 5 minutes to pour my beer I have never felt so unimportant in a restaurant establishment in my whole life! She was the absolute worst bartender I have ever encountered ! And the sad part about it was she wasn't even busy she was more more focused on talking with certain customers and ignoring others. Sad that this is one of the few late night spots in town..Jen really needs to be retrained behind the bar when it comes to speed and being attentive to all customers,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hanford-3?start=20
Ann M.,"Anaheim, CA",95,253,2,2.0,5/5/2013,"My boyfriend and I had dinner because we had a gift card.  We decided to go for the 2 for $20 menu.  We ordered the mozarella sticks as our shared appetizer.   The mozzarella sticks were nothing special - just you're run of the mill frozen mozzarella sticks, dunked in a fyer and served with warmed up probably canned marina sauce.  We were both shocked by the number of mozzarella sticks served - it was way more than enough for two and would easily work as an app for 4.   For our entrees, I ordered the Asian Chicken salad and he ordered the sirloin.  Both of use were incredibly disappointed with our meals.  First, I don't think some lettuce with a few carrot shavings sufficiently qualifies as ""salad.""  In my opinion, you need a larger variety of produce or it's just protein served on a bed of lettuce.  Second, the only ""Asian"" thing about this ""salad"" was the sprinkling of fried noodles.  There were no mandarin oranges or anything else as you might expect.  Lame.  Also, the sliced almonds they added weren't toasted and were completely lacking flavor.  The breaded chicken was also flavorless.  I guess they were depending on the fact that you would drowned your salad in the sickly sweet honey mustard dressing and therefore be satisfied?  I was not.  I eventually gave up eating and opted to go to bed hungry.   My boyfriend's sirloin came with 2 sides.  He opted to pay $1 more and have one of the sides be a salad, but he said it wasn't worth it.  His side salad was lame in the same way my dinner salad was - hardly any produce.  I guess Applebee's makes salads for people that hate veggies?  His baked potato was tasteless, served with a blob of sour cream and a pat of butter that added nothing.  Finally, his sirloin was overcooked and as he said, ""just bad....it's just bad.  I'm done eating this.""  Despite the fact that both of us left large portions of our meal and refused to-go boxes, no one ever asked us if something was wrong or really inquired about our meal at all.  The service generally matched our food - crappy and regrettable.  We won't be back, even if someone curses us with another giftcard for this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hanford-3?start=20
