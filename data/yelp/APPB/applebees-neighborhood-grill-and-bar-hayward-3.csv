I went on a thursday evening to wait out the rush hour commute traffic and ordered the ""pick 2"" bar bites (chicken wings and nachos) for $9 and the bahahama mama, which was an all-day special for $4 I was actually impressed by the quality of the wings... they were much better than I'd expected... The bartender made my drink well and was such a sweetheart! I'm surprised by the negative reviews for this place as my experience was great..

Juanita O.,"San Leandro, CA",0,6,,4.0,4/5/2017,"This is my second review for this location.  It has improved from 2 to 4 stars.  We went in last Saturday at lunch time, and we were promptly seated.  The server was very nice and attentive.  I have no complaints on the service, my complaint is on my all time favorite Asian chicken salad.  This salad was my favorite, and I ordered it almost every time, until they CHANGED it and not for the better.  I am talking about a full size salad that I am paying $11 for, and this is what I got:  a very large bowl with a ""handfull"" of not so fresh romaine lettuce, grilled, sliced small chicken breast, and salad dressing on side!  The side salads are bigger than this one. This is what the salad used to be like: big bowl 2/3rds filled with shredded green and purple cabbage, crispy noodles, some type of seeds and I think sliced almonds, with nice chicken and dressing.  This is the way I loved it and the way Asian salads are served elsewhere. Whats up with the romaine lettuce?  at least give enough to look like a dinner salad; it's not that expensive.  Very disappointed!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hayward-3?start=40

Janelle S.,"Discovery Bay, CA",118,23,5,1.0,11/17/2016,"Just don't come here! We came here 5:40 ordered drinks and mozzarella sticks. Ordered our 4 cheese burgers for 4 people (super complicated order I know) at 5:45 Our drinks showed up around 6:20 and our appetizers around 6:30. People who got here after us had already gotten their food and left at this point.  Our drinks sucked they were so sweet and disgusting, also probably no alcohol in the margarita. Our food didn't arrive until 6:40 and at that point 3 out of the 4 burgers arrived. I had to wait another 10 minutes to get my burger. All of my friends fries were cold and burgers over cooked and burnt. So seeing as the food wasn't fresh and warm chance are our waitress just forgot us. Then when it came to finally bringing us our bill it was wrong, no surprise. Like really wrong like another tables bill wrong... saddest part of the night was that the place wasn't even busy.  Currently still at the restaurant waiting to pay this wrong bill so stay tuned if more crazy stuff goes wrong.

Nene R.,"Berkeley, CA",14,249,,1.0,5/9/2016,"Mom wanted this....really, really badly. No amount of cajoling would do.  I think she likes it for their two for $20 deals when she goes with her other senior citizen friends.... So, so bad.  Items not as described on menu.  When you ask about it, waitress just shrugs and says ""that's what it is"".   Lackluster and lackadaisical come to mind. First the appetizers: you get two for $10 The two we want, they don't have.  So we go with her suggestions of the shrimp and the mini tacos.  Neither one if us ate more then our initial taste:  shrimp had a heavy mayo sauce and tacos used old BBQ chicken tough to chew. Mom got a steak dish with m.potoes and gravy...not cooked to her request for medium rare...really well done.  sent back and came back the same....and they must have just reused the same plate as potatoes were cold and gravy congealed.   Asked  for something new...and they still charged 1\2 price for the original! I thought I would be safe with the waitresses suggestion of the 3 brisket enchiladas.  What arrived was a tortilla with a spoonful of meat covered by another tortilla, some enchilada sauce and a gagging amount of semi melted cheese.  So.... I say this isn't as described or pictured on the menu.  Waitress gets the menu reads and then says "" it equals the same thing"" and turns to leaves...I ask for a house salad instead of the meal.  Bill had the meal...but no charge for the salad.  So, she tried?!?

John T.,"San Leandro, CA",0,5,,2.0,7/7/2017,Craving a steak but didn't want to drive far to get one. Haven't been to Applebee's in a while. Never ordered a steak there before. Ordered the Bourbon Street Steak Medium Rare. Wife ordered Medium. Steak came out Medium Well the wife's was well. So we mentioned it to the manager so she could correct the cook. She told us that the steaks come out on the sizzling hot plates and they keep cooking. We should next time order steaks more rare to compensate for the cooking. If the steaks keep cooking after they bring them out the cooks should no how to cook them so they are not overdone when they are served.Should not be up to the customer to know how the cook is cooking the steak. One the worst steaks I have had in a long time. Even the Red Potato's that came with the steak were under cooked. Very hard like half cooked.The manager did comp us a couple dollars off each plate but that doesn't fix how the steak is prepared.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hayward-3?start=60

Maybe if you give a better service with a smile on your face showing that you actually care, maybe these customers would give you more tips!    Guess what?

I wasn't looking for anything fancy, but if I were, I would go all out. But that wasn't the case and me and babe are ballin.. on a budget!    Anyways, came here Friday night with my boyfriend because we were oh so hungry. He wanted to go to a sit down restaurant and this was one of the places open. It was a bit late so our choices were limited. It was nice inside, but could've been more organized. Many drunk folks at the bar. Wasn't packed in the seating areas. Our server did take pretty long. It seems like I always have that issue at Applebee's. They need to get it together. Lol, I've been to Applebee's one other time before and I love the 2 for $20. I already knew what I had wanted. Yup, we did the 2 for $20.  I got the chicken cavatappi pasta. Pretty good. Felt like the chicken was skimped, but everybody be doin that!! Babe for some lemon chicken or something like that. That was actually quite great. I kept picking off his plate lol. Our appetizer was mozzarella sticks! I highly recommend that. Ooey gooey cheese and marinara sauce? Yes!!!

Debbie S.,"Hayward, CA",14,9,5,1.0,6/16/2017,"Bad service again tonight at Applebee's. After ordering and waiting for 45 minutes we had to ask where our salads. They served my salad on a piping hot plate, when I said the plate is too hot and this is a cold salad I was told ""well I'm really busy and it's gonna be a while"" so I told him I wasn't going to eat the salad, next they bring out my dinner which was the caprese chicken which I've had before and it's delicious and beautiful, and it looked like dog food, absolutely atrocious. So a manager was asked to speak with us, but instead went about taking care of receipts, and then when he did come to talk to us, he was clueless.  I was so angry I had to leave the restaurant and my husband had to take care of the bill. We did not get to eat our dinner, and are leaving HUNGRY.

We entered the restaurant and no one was there to greet us. We then walked over to a booth while making eye contact with the staff over by the bar. I then run off to the bathroom and upon my return my friend is sitting at the booth with just her menu and no waters. It looked as though she was never acknowledged.  She began asking me questions about happy hour and I responded with ""the waiter didn't tell you about happy hour specials?"" She said no one has come over yet. At this time we had been there for about 10 minutes. This isn't the first time my friend exclaimed, they always treat us bad in here! I looked over at the bar and I seen two (which looked like waiters) standing over by the bar looking at us. By this time we both realized we didn't want to sit there continuously waiting and not being waited on or seeing anything on the menu that we wanted at the time so by the 15 minute mark we were out of there! The staff needs training and the Manager does also. This was very unprofessional and it was done to a Yelper! You never know who is walking through the doors of your establishment.

First, I want to start off by saying Applebees is one of those places you don't expect much from. You go in order, eat, and go home. Plain and simple. But during my visit, I think the host may have been flustered.  During our visit, we walked in and asked for a To-go menu and the host said that he'll be back to ""grab the lady that does the to go orders"". The women who helped us was very friendly and patient with us. She would probably be the only reason why my visit is rated this high. She took very good care of us. But as we were waiting for the kitchen to prepare our order, I could hear other customers complaining to the host that they were being skipped.

They said there was a waiting list for that too, despite half the tables being empty. So we sat directly at the bar because we didn't want to wait.  There was one bartender and three customers, but she was making drinks for the restaurant, so we understood the 5 minute wait before she got to us. Still, she could have looked at us and acknowledged us or something. After 5 minutes she grabbed a couple menus, and without making eye contact or saying hello she gave them to us. Didn't ask us if we wanted anything to drink. Hello, we're sitting at a bar.  A couple minutes after that, without the bartender coming back to us about drinks of food or anything, one of the servers came to the entrance of the service area and ""playfully"" threw a handful of ice at the bartender which bounced all over the bar. So that's why 15 people are waiting for a table?  Maybe two minutes after that we just got up and left. Even if we would have gotten service we didn't want to be there. Honestly, we found it funny more than anything. Never in either of our lives have we seen such bad service.

If I had talked to a customer the way I was spoken to, I would have my head chewed out by my customers. My party of 5 that consisted of my parents, brother, 1 year old child and I walked into this Applebee's and there was no host standing at the podium. It took 5 minutes to be acknowledged by anyone. When we were actually acknowledged, I'm not even sure that that individual was actually a host. If he was, he was a joke. He tried to seat just my brother and I without asking us how many people were in our party. He realized that there were 4 and a baby. He said the wait will be ""10 minutes"". I asked if he wanted my name so he could call us up. He said that he will remember us. Oh, and because they ran out of ink at the host station... How do you run out of ink? Run your business better!! Do you not have pens to sign credit card receipts or will you just remember that each customer paid their bill based on the honor system? At least pretend to care, find a pen or a marker, and write down my name, dude. There were 2 families ahead of us. 30 minutes and 4 parties that came in after us later, we got seated. Our server, Karen B, took our drink orders. 2 lemonades and 2 waters. 10 minutes later, she took our order. She brought us 4 waters and had to go back for our lemonades. 20 minutes later, we had not received our appetizers and the party that came in after us received their bar drinks and their appetizers and entrees. We told her that we were going to leave and our appetizers actually made it to our table at this time. She told me that it has not been a long wait and that dinner takes 15 to 20 minutes to come out, with the biggest attitude. I told her that we had been here for that entire duration and that that party received their entire meal before us. Apparently, according to Karen, they were a party of two and that why they got their food before us. If dinner takes 15 to 20 minutes, why haven't I gotten my appetizers during that time frame? Also, it was definitely not busy at this dinner service. Half the restaurant was empty. Needless to say, we left.  The ONLY thing that was decent here was the Manager On Duty. I don't know his name but he took care of the appetizers that we didn't touch and our lemonades. He was a really nice guy.

The chicken is good (I don't know how to complain against fried food.. its just so yummy no matter what). The rice pilaf that came with it was watery and the veggies mixed in was unrecognizable.

The onions weren't cooked enough and still cloudy and not translucent.  So we decided to come here for dinner last night to try it out. This is only my second time eating at applebees. The first time was in LA and I had a horrible experience with long waits and nasty food. I was skeptical coming in but I was hopeful. So we waited for about 20 minutes which was permissible. As we made our way to our booth, we noticed that there were MANY tables empty and that was really suspicious. Anyways we were just glad that we finally got seated. To be honest, nothing seemed really appetizing on the menu. Some things looked really good on the picture but we al knew that when it came out on the plate, it would be nothing but disappointing. The waiter was normal got our drinks and orders. My friend ordered the asian chicken salad and I ordered the three cheese penne. My family ordered other things. So we wait and wait. We noticed that two tables that got seated after us even got their food before us. This is not right at all. I'm hating this place even more. But, we kept ourselves busy as our total wait time for this restaurant added up to be 1 hr. Food finally comes and the plate is super hot but the food isn't smoking. Not fresh as we expected. First thing my friend told me was that my chicken is from frozen as she works at a restaurant herself. The chicken tastes burnt all over and the penne was nothing special. It really was disappointing and I had no more appetite. Of course my friend enjoyed her food because it was just salad.  bottom line: I'm never coming here again or eating at any other Applebees.

The food was okay, nothing fabulous, but pretty good if you get the 2 for $20 deal.  Second, the service was subpar. Our waiter kept screwing up our order and the surrounding tables. He also messed up our receipt, and we had to correct him several times.  Third, be wary of ordering drinks. The prices are hidden for a reason, they don't want you to see how much you're spending!

We would walk over, and get a triple chocolate meltdown to soothe our damaged souls. lol. the Davis location wasn't bad, locals and college students were their clientele. The servers were always nice. and it was clean. HOWEVER, this location in Hayward is a wholeeeee other story. we come here very randomly and rarely for happy hour. Let's just do a quick run through Food: The food here sucks, lol. Nothing I've ordered here tastes ""good"" and definitely would not pay the non-happy hour price. We ordered our triple chocolate meltdown, though the cake was good, the server brought it out the us with the ice cream entirely melted. that was ridiculous. He said it was cause of the freezer, well if ur gonna bring me something that looks like shit, u shouldnt bring it out at all. Just tell me your freezer is broken and that the ice cream is melted. and take a dollar off the cake. But no, he gave me my cake next to a pool of melted ice cream. thank you for that, guy. Drinks: It depends who bartending, i've had good margaritas, and not so good margaritas. If you dont want to risk it, i suggest you order a beer. Service: service here isnt terrible, but you can tell the people that work here kinda hates their job, and just really doesnt give a shit. lol. i.e. the melted ice cream incident that ruined our memories of a perfect Triple Chocolate Meltdown!!!! It takes forever for food and drinks to come out. No water refills. No offering of napkins. you know the simple stuff. Cleanliness: Its definitely not clean. There's crap all over the floor, the tables are sometimes sticky, stuff on the chair. Eeeek. The only reason why we would come back is for the happy hour drinks. ill never order my cake here again. lol.  and hopefully i wont get that halfway stupid server -.- seriously? liquid ice cream, if i wanted milk, i woulda asked for it. =[",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hayward-3?start=120

Flower S.,"Los Angeles, CA",116,3,,1.0,12/27/2015,"Not long wait time to be seated. When seated waiter was a bit standoffish. We ordered our food. Didnt get asked how we wanted our meat cooked. When We got our order I was done with my drink. Not once did she ask me if I wanted another one. Our appetizers came same time as our food. However they were sitting there.. Why didn't they bring them out when they were ready? The way I know they were done is bc the motzarella sticks were soggy on the side that was touching the plate as if it was sitting there a while. Also, the Maranara sauce had a dehydrated  top layer. Also indicative that it was just sitting there in the warmer. Again, why didn't they serve it? Kind of gross to have one side soggy one side crispy motzarella sticks. The chicken plate was edible, the stake plate had good mashed potatoes... That's it. The meat had a weird texture to it and was not cooked evenly. It was also like some mystery meat... rubbery and well done on the thinner side and the thicker side was nervy and chewy and rare. Why didn't we get asked how we wanted the stake and why didn't it resemble a cut that I'm familiar with... really gross. We lost our appetite, after we pointed out it was chewy and not well cooked. Then the waitress put in an order for another stake, but it took forever to come out, like at least 20 minutes. We decided to leave even if one of us was still hungry. By this time we we were ready to go with a headache and stress, because the manager lady decided to have her dinner break right next to us.... she was complaining about work issues regarding people who where working that moment, and talked down to employees that approached her. The other, I suppose, second in command gentleman having his break with her was soft speaking aND fortunately I couldn't hear his portion of the conversation. But the lady manager was loud and had no qualms about speaking work problems in front of customers. This was distasteful and frankly ruined my experience of the little good aspects of the food.

Got seated immediately and server came over within a matter of a minute. It was a pretty good size crowd but no delay in service. I order there crosscut ribs, all you can eat special. My food came out less than 15 minutes with large portion sizes, I questioned whether I would be able to eat another plate because I knew I would not finish the first one. The server was attentive, checking on me and even ordering a second plate ( you can try the other flavors with each plate) while I still had a sizable portion left. She stated that it would be a minute so she wanted to make sure my order was in when I finished. I never finished but did get my second plate and ate a bit, taking the rest home.  Came back the same week the Friday with my sister, slightly larger crowd but not by much, we did get seated quickly. Our waitress was great and came over for ordering within 5 minutes. We ordered, I ordered the same thing from the 9th with all you can eat and my sister a burger. Easy peasy right...no. About 15 minutes in our waitress has to go on her 30 minutes, no problem she introduced us to our fill in waiter. Cool. Nope, he's  not attentive, granted we didn't get our food until nearly an hour after entering the place. So him being attentive to all the empty tables who had no food in the area would have just been status updates. Nothing. Even the chick selling jello shots was more attentive. We had decided we would not leave a tip if he was still the waiter at checkout, because my sister cup was sitting on E forever. When you are hungry and you wait as long as we did, I started questioning whether I was really hungry or experience phantom hunger symptoms. We entered and sat at 9:45pm, I looked up and it was 10:39 and we still had no food, all the tables in that area had no food, most of them entered within 5 minutes of us. I thought I could have hit a drive thru already before the food came out. But when it did come out, it was less of a portion than the previous time, no biggie, it's all you can eat. We requested napkins because I'm eating ribs with my hands and not a fork, they weren't brought automatically like logic would suggest. And my sister has a burger, something you eat with your hands, at least we do.  There wasn't even the rolled silverware on the table, wait never mind wrong restaurant.  I started to question had I made the request because he took forever to bring napkins, I had to ask the host standing at the door for napkins. Guess who came quicker, the host but the waiter did come with napkins. He never came back over after the napkins, I thought I had all you can eat, granted I still had food on my plate but with the nearly hour wait for food he could have at least asked if I wanted to order more.  Within 15 minutes of getting our food, our old waitress was back, I put in my request to go containers, the check and another order to go.

We also have NEVER ordered carside to go here and have someone bring it out to us. We have to go inside. Every. Single. Time. (Even though we request carside- inside pick up is another option). Last night I literally sat in the spot for 20 mins, called them from my car, then waited another 10 mins before going inside. Their food is ok, but they last several times they messed up our order as well. The only reason I give two stars is their manager- Ricky- was very nice. He offered us two free appetizers. I appreciate that someone recognized the ridiculous wait time this time, but this happens EVERY time. The only reason we still go is it is the only semi-decent to-go food that isn't fast food in this area.

Priscilla C.,"Oakland, CA",22,38,169,1.0,8/9/2013,"Decided to give Applebees a try for late night dinner with my family since we always see Applebees around, but never tried it. All I can say is that it was one of the worst meals I've had at a restaurant. Service: horrible. With a party of three, the waiter took 15 minutes to get to us even though there were tables open. The waiters were just talking to each other in the back. Gave them a benefit of the doubt because it was around 9pm.. but when it came to ordering food, it took FOREVER to wave a waiter down to take our order. The waiter recommended the steak and chicken dish because those were ""applebees specials"".. which we regret later.  Food: waited for probably 30minutes before the food came out and it wasn't even hot.. but WARM/on the side of cold. We ordered a 7oz steak and portebello chicken dish, hoping the food would look somewhat like the menu. BOY WERE WE WRONG. The steak was inedible and even my mom who's tolerant to ""not that great food"" spat what she ate out and regretted eating out that night. The portions are small on oversized plates, the plates were half filled with potatoes. The chicken was dry and the outside was covered in sauce. There were barely any portebello mushrooms, and their veges are you typical frozen vege: a broccoli and some carrots. Cost: expensive for such below average food. The two dishes came out to be around $30. I'm so disappointed and highly recommend against trying this place out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hayward-3?start=180

Then our waiter came by and said the food will be out shortly, at this time 30 minutes had passed and the table behind me was waiting for the check.

After ordering, we waited 45 minutes to an hour for our food. Our food came out randomly. The waitress, Krystyana, didn't refill drinks, didn't bring bar drinks, didn't bring our appetizers, and brought half our tables meals. Staff there were very unprofessional. One waitress was rudely pushing through our party as we all stood up to walk out and talk with manager yelling ""EXUSE ME!"" While rolling her eyes. I over heard the manager telling his staff that he was going to have to ""throw some left elbows"". The manager was as ignorant and rude as his staff, which speaks volumes of the service at this establishment. We were threatened by staff and manager.

Upon getting there, my mom and I asked one of the hostesses and then the bartender when we sat at the bar to change the channel. Why it wasn't on in the first place is beyond me. They had some college basketball game on instead. The bartender immediately went to tell the manager to change it. Apparently, the only person who has access to change the channels is the manager. We waited and waited and waited and still nothing. When he finally came out, he changed the channel alright but to the wrong station. We then had to wait even longer! We didn't get the Warriors game on until there was 5:46 left in the 4th quarter. Mind you, when we got there, I checked my phone and there was about 2 minutes left in the 3rd quarter! It's absolutely ridiculous that it took that long just to get the TV changed to a game that should've been on in the first place!

People on Yelp! seriously need a wake up call because I'm starting to think that they wouldn't know good food if it hit them in the face. Mind you, I came on a Thursday night with a couple of friends. We were originally gonna go down the street to Mimi's Cafe but it was closed. I had my qualms with this Applebee's because their food absolutely sucked in the past. I hadn't been to this place in about 6 years since then. Until now. The place was PACKED on a Thursday night. But we were able to get a seat in a matter of 10 minutes.  The vibe of this place was really cool too, just a great place to hang out with friends or grab a beer and watch the game. We ordered a sampler trio, and the Appetizer + 2 Entrees for $20. In the sampler trio, we had the Steak Towers, Chicken Wonton Tacos, and Boneless Buffalo Wings. I didn't get to try the steak towers but the tacos and wings were great. The taco was really fresh and had grilled chicken inside it, drizzled with a sweet and sour sauce. The wings were really tender and juicy, but crisp on the outside. For the appetizer we had the Spinach & Artichoke Dip which was just creamy and flavorful. It was probably one of the better dips I had in a chain restaurant. For my entree, I had the Bourbon Street Chicken & Shrimp, which was just absolutely amazing. I always dread ordering chicken breast from these chain restaurants because they usually come out dry and cardboard-like. Until this dish at Applebee's, I used to swear to Olive Garden's chicken entrees, because their chicken was really tender. But this just changed everything. The red-skin potatoes were so good, with the carmelized onions and mushrooms in the bourbon glaze. The bourbon glaze was just perfect flavor for this dish. And topping it with the shrimp and garlic-herb butter was like the cherry on top.  We were stuffed and didn't get to have dessert but I will DEFINITELY be coming back to this Applebee's. It's NOT the BEST FOOD IN THE WORLD, but it excels in its category. And it DEFINITELY REDEEMED ITSELF from its horrid past, hands down. The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because the service took a while, but that was only because it was just super busy. Our waitress was really nice and patient with us because we couldn't decide what to order from their new and improved, yet HUGE menu.

I showed up around 9:05pm and were still seated at the bar. We didn't get a table until 9:15pm but we weren't given any menus and I wasn't asked if I wanted anything to drink. What upset us the most was that we were left sitting there until 9:30pm. No waiter/waitress, I didn't have a drink, and 1 of the 2 friends of mine just got off work and hadn't eaten yet. We decided to leave, by that time it was 9:35pm. On our way out my buddy told the waitress that we had been sitting over at that table waiting for someone to take our order.

Rachel N.,"Oakland, CA",45,68,2,2.0,4/29/2012,"All night (a Saturday night) I was debating between giving one star or two. I'd say that their saving grace for the second star was the food. Customer service here was not their best, and was made worse when the bar started to get more people. Note here, if you want fast service then you should get seated in the bar area. People who were seated after us there were getting their food before us. To be more explanatory, here's what happened. My group of 6 adults and a two-year-old got seated about 8:50. We didn't see our first server until about 9. Oh wait...sorry, she was our 'drink server'. Which she rudely made clear when we told her we were ready to order. Five minutes later were get another server come over to take our drinks. He also said that he would be taking our order. We get as far as giving out our drinks (again) and he leaves. We were left there wondering why he didn't take our order too, since we said we were ready. He comes back with our drinks and takes our order at about 9:10. Two of us ordered regular dishes, four of us order the 2 for $20 meals, and there was a child's mac 'n cheese. We didn't see any sign of the appetizers for the 2 for $20 until about 9:30, about the time the bar was starting to get into full swing. This is where we saw that people there, seated after us, were eating and yet we had nothing. I think it was about another 20 or so minutes later, we finally get our entrees. Unfortunately it was too late for the part of us with the two-year-old, who was tantruming from the late hour and lack of food she was getting. They had to pack up and leave for home....which took another 10 to 20 minutes (waiting for the check and some containers) and was a comedy of errors in itself . First he comes with the checks for everyone, and only got one out of the three right. We had to wait for him to go back and fix it. Then we find out that some of us had drinks that were competed and others that were not. We didn't bother trying to stay for dessert, cause we were worried we wouldn't get out until midnight. Mind you, though, some of the food was not bad. I had the bourbon chicken with shrimp. The flavors were exquisite, the chicken moist, and the shrimp the right texture while holding the flavors quite nicely. I tried the some of my friends three cheese penne and chicken in case I wanted to get it next time. It was alright. The combination of the cheese they used didn't really worked for me and the sauce was not real creamy. Was sadden me was, though the vegetables were flavored nicely, you could tell they were frozen due to the face that they weren't steamed very well. Most of them were mildly warm and one was ice cold.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hayward-3?start=260

We got in around 930pm and it really wasn't that busy but our server didn't even remember to bring utensils or water until we asked for it. The borthday boy didnt even get to eat his food for 15 minutes because it took them that long to get us our utensils. Just asking for normal things like water, utensils, and ranch seemed like a troublesome task. Another friend of mine ordered the oriental salad and wanted to ask for ranch but she denied him and said it's already on the salad.

I don't have high expectations for Applebees, as previous Yelpers have stated, it's a chain restaurant and it's nothing fancy. However this particular Applebees, really annoyed me last night. Usually, when we go to this Applebees, the service pleasant.(The reason for the two stars).Unfortunately, I don't recall our servers from the past, but last night I can recall the one who was serving us. Seriously, I don't know if she was on one on the job/drunk, whatever.. Tatiana 1) she spilled the ranch, joked about it that it was our fault- we had to remind her repeatedly about it btw & it took apprx 30 mins to bring it 2) messed up on our drink order and joked about spitting in the new one 3)took more than half an hour for our Happy Hour appetizers of tacos... AND THEN the spinach dip which we also had to remind her repeatedly. I don't think there was anything humorous about any of this, but she believed all of it was a joke.

She had a very pleasant smile and was very polite. Got stuck between a couple of menu items and she was able to help me decide. I had the 4 cheese mac & cheese. Didn't like it apparently so I sent it back and ordered something else. However, my boyfriend's plate had small plastic circles that he bit into off of his vegetables. Assuming it came from a frozen bag. We didn't send it back for a new plate because it was just plastic. Not to mention we both come from working in the food industry so we understand.

jeff c.,"Hayward, CA",110,53,28,1.0,12/27/2010,"I don't normally like giving bad reviews but this was an absolute must.  Arrived here at about 730 PM and sat at the bar for a couple quick beers and a little something to munch on. It was crowded in the restaurant but there didn't seem to be too many drink orders coming thru yet the bartender couldn't keep up at all. It took us about 10 minutes to get our beers from the time we sat down. The guy had no idea how to multitask. I also noticed that other people around the bar were waiting for drinks and to put in food orders. I just chalked it up to him having a bad day.  After people started filtering out of the bar area I noticed the thing that really bothered me. There were dirty dishes and glasses sitting on the bar 20-30 minutes after people had left and I'm not talking about a dish here or there, I'm talking about piles of plates and dirty glasses lined up. I kept waiting for the bartender, manager or someone else to notice but nothing ever happened. A couple walked in and sat down and they had a stack of dishes about a foot to their right and another gentleman walked in and had 4 dirty glasses in front of him. I couldn't believe they would leave it like that. I said something to the bartender and he was giving a bunch of excuses. He was too busy trying to get at the hostesses (who were obviously annoyed with him) rather than making sure the customers were satisfied.

Anna W.,"San Leandro, CA",491,576,478,2.0,12/28/2010,"Wanting to give the place another try, your leading Yelp-lady went back for a dessert visit with two of her lovely ladies a few months after the meal mishap. After being seated promptly, the menus were cracked open and pored over. Applebee's desserts are none too large, but it sounded like a good idea at the time. After all the orders had been placed, the waitress (a different one from the last unfortunate visit) scurried off. Making small talk with her friends and giggling over the latest social gossip, the time seemed to pass by quickly before the waitress returned and apologized -- evidently, the kitchen had run out of ice cream. Her two orders of dessert shooters would have to be changed, unless she didn't mind the lack of ice cream. Shaking her head, she was chagrined but changed her order because it wouldn't have been the same without the ice cream. Lifting her hands helplessly as the waitress scurried away again, she sputtered, ""I'm cursed when it comes to Applebee's!"" The rest of the evening was spent pleasantly enough, but she swore she would not return -- her experience here had simply been soured by these two visits. ...or so she thought. Months later, the boy convinced her to give them one final try. Perhaps going with a male instead of her female compatriots would break the curse. They arrived and were seated fairly promptly -- it was a weeknight and so the restaurant wasn't terribly crowded. Their glasses of water came rather slowly (though it wasn't the waitress' fault -- something about her manager requesting her to do a trivial task that he could've done himself) and her nerves were set on edge -- was the curse beginning to rear its ugly head again? Luckily for her sanity, the rest of the evening passed by rather pleasantly. There were no further mishaps with the food or with the service. The food was a little on the bland side (really, seasonal veggies do NOT amount to simply broccoli -- broccoli is a year-round veggie!) but otherwise no other complaints could be made. The curse appeared to be broken. As they left, the boy turned to his lady and inquired if she was worried about her curse returning -- she had mentioned earlier that the true test would be returning with her lovely ladies to try their service again. She shrugged and said, with a helpless laugh, ""I'm hoping it is. But unfortunately (or maybe fortunately) for them, I really don't know if I want come back to figure it out for sure.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hayward-3?start=240

But the email listed on the receipt is wrong and the automated system takes you no where....  We have always been fans of Apple Bee's it use to be our place to go Friday nights. The food was good , and most importantly the service was great. Within the past 12 months we have noticed that we don't visit the restaurant as much as we use to. The service has not been the best, and several times I have caught myself returning my food because the waiter took the wrong information. With all that being said we decided to visit Applebee's once again this Sunday for late lunch. Honestly this has topped it off for us.  We truly do wish the service would improve. The wait was not long at all took them about 5-10 minutes to sit us down. Our waiter Michael C. took our drink order gave us a couple minutes to decide and shortly after came back to take our order.  And then it began.  Appetizers came out we waited 10 minutes before we had to remind him for the 2nd time to bring us plates.  It seems like the plates had just gotten out of the washer and were wet. The funny part is there were three of us and he only brought out two. We sucked it all up and waited for our food. I specifically told him about 3 times that I wanted no cheese on my salad. They brought out the food and there was cheese on the salad I requested the salad to be corrected and they told me it would be a couple minutes 30 minutes later I still did not have my salad. Our waiter was concerned that he had lost his personal pursue and was going all over the place trying to find it and completely forgot about the clients he had waiting. I finally got a hold of him and told him to cancel my salad order. His exact words were"" I am not sure if I'm going to be able to but I will try"".  I had to ask another gentleman that was walking around cleaning the area to get us our tab. We were running late and just needed to get out. It took another 15 minutes before the waiter came back with our tab and sure enough he tried charging for the salad that I wanted and never got. I went to the front asked to speak to a manager but apparently there was no one who could help. A gal finally deleted the order and charged me.  This has completely topped our experience with Applebee's if we were some random people I am sure we would have gotten away with just walking out on him and not paying. He was not paying any attention to what he was doing, several times we were looking for him to get his attention and he was in and out the restaurant.

And this only, after I walk over to the bar to see if we can just order at the bar. Then the appetizers come, we asked for some extra dressing, this never showed up.  We ordered our food, dinner came at different times for all 4 of us. In addition, one of us ordered grilled salmon with veggies and mashed potatoes; the veggies were not even on the plate. We asked the server where the veggies were, she goes in some kind of incomprehensible oblivion; like ""huh, ummm......""  Then another server came over and informed us that he will bring it over soon as. As for the rest of the evening, it was pretty torturous all the way. The servers were more concerned to gather around the entrance/greeting podium and flirt with guests or maybe their friends rather than making rounds around the table.  I'm not a demanding person, but rather relaxed and easy going; however, ignorance, disrespect and inferior complex by the hosts makes me feel that they don't care whether clients show up or not.  This is not the place to take your family; but a place for happy hour beers with rowdy friends who wouldn't care to be shown any respect.

Next time ill go to Fridays, Elephant Bar or Chili's instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hayward-3?start=280
Angelina M.,"Allen, TX",176,258,43,2.0,2/11/2010,"I should know better. The honey wanted to meet up for a quick lunch and seeing as how I was super eager to see him I said YES to Applebee's without even thinking. I had the ceaser salad and it was super mushy. The chicken was good, the croutons didn't go with the salad. He got the Chinese salad(?) He ate most of it. Iced tea was good, our server didn't bug us which was nice. Next time I think I'll try and talk him into E bar. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hayward-3?start=280
Daryl Y.,"San Francisco, CA",116,80,6,1.0,1/19/2010,"I've been in this restaurant about a half dozen times and I have not been impressed. The last time I went, our waitress was very rude even though I was as warm and polite as I could be. Food was slow to come out, and drinks were never refilled. There were three discrepancies on the receipt totalling 16 dollars, and the waitress was adamant that she did not make any mistakes. I explained in detail the discrepancies, and she says ""Ohhh-"" but there was no apology for calling me a liar. correcting the mistakes on the receipt, she accidentally charges us another table's tab, and was again adamant that she charged the right amount. The place is not clean, the 2 dollar pints really cost 4 bucks and they are half a pint, and the staff is very unfriendly. I regret taking my family to this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hayward-3?start=280
Maureen M.,"San Mateo, CA",0,5,,5.0,7/8/2012,"So my car broke down late last night off the freeway, and I had to park into the applebees and wait for a tow.  It was closing time there, but everyone was soooooo nice in letting me and my sister stay and wait for our tow while they closed down.  Though I don't regularly go to the East Bay (I live in San Mateo) Applebees great hospitality has definitely enticed my to go back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hayward-3?start=280
Cynthia B.,"Hercules, CA",913,1062,87,3.0,12/21/2007,"First of all I don't like Applebee's.  This is a average Applebee's location.  Perhaps a little below average.  Too pricey for the food and drinks you get, just like every other Applebee's.  Friendly service.  Very weird parking lot layout, it's like a maze made by someone who has never drawn one before.   This location should be open much later.  I wish that customers would come together and demand better food and interior decoration that isn't such an eyesore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hayward-3?start=280

Jess O.,"East Bay, CA",95,259,36,4.0,9/2/2010,"Its all about the HH! I've never been here for dinner or an actual meal, so I can't comment on that. But I do enjoy their happy hour!  Cheap appetizers, cheap drinks! how can you lose? You definitely won't be losing any weight. That's for sure! I usually get the Wonton Tacos and make my bf get the Hot Wings or Boneless Chicken. I gotta have my Hot Wings. The Nachos are huge! So get it to share. It's a chain restaurant so it's as much as you can expect from a chain. It's good for the price and fun to meet with friends.  HINT: if you are health conscious get the Chicken Wonton Tacos they have the least calories of all the appetizers. Also, HH doesn't include the sampler plate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hayward-3?start=280

Esther G.,"Hayward, CA",51,11,1,1.0,3/29/2012,"i was at applebees hayward location earlier this week and the service, food, and drinks were just not worth my time and money. I had ordered potato twisters as my appetizers and the potatoes had oil residues on it looks black and oil dripping! i than asked the waiter to change it and he came back in less than 5 minutes with the same looking plate. it was weird how it took them almost 30mins to get my appetizer and when i requested it to be changed he got me my appetizer in less than 5mins!! the food sucked! it was a big plate with half the plate empty! my brother had ordered one of their sizzling plates which was not even sizzling! the drinks was all ice!! the server gave me the bill when i wasn't half way done and the server had not checked on us!! bad bad customer service! i will not go back to applebees hayward location! it was really disappointing! and the bills was almost 45$ !!! comeonnnn 45$ ...wasted my money!! go else guys...we spend so much we deserve better service and food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hayward-3?start=320
Cremaster T.,"San Ramon, CA",0,7,,3.0,1/7/2010,"We go here fairly often as it's my daughters favorite restaurant.  They love the mac and cheese as well as the appitizers.  We've sampled much of the menu which is actually pretty good.  The service can be pretty slow but the wait is usually pretty short, even at peak times which is nice when you have small children.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hayward-3?start=320
