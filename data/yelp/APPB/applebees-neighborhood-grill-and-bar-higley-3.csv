Jesse A.,"Mesa, AZ",23,24,6,1.0,8/9/2014,"If your looking for a fun bar, don't go here.... If you picture a bar with good music and everyone laughing then this is not the place to go... We went in ready to have a good time but between the 60's- 80's mix and the sleepy atmosphere we were ready to go have some actual fun... If your 60-80yrs old this is your place, if your young and want fun this is not even an option.... I'm sitting here now and it's Saturday night and 11:00pm and I'm ready to go to sleep in a booth at the bar.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-higley-3?start=40
James F.,"Gilbert, AZ",187,3,,1.0,4/4/2016,"My girlfriend and I came in last Saturday around 1:30ish and it wasn't super busy, pretty steady. We were on our way to go sit in one of the bar booths and we asked the hostess if we could sit there, she said ""no, I just sat this section and the server is getting drinks right now for other tables!"" She then offered a dirty high top to us, so we sat there. The family that came in right behind us got greeted and sat right at the booth we requested before. Annoying. Then as we sat in the high top for 10 minutes with no service or acknowledgement that we were even there. At least 6 people walked by us without saying a word. One waitress walked by multiple times and didn't give any service. She seemed ""in the weeds"". We were not greeted by the bartender as well who also walked by multiple times. We then decided to leave. It sucks cause I like this place, hopefully it was just a fluke!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-higley-3?start=40
Drey J.,"Chandler, AZ",151,26,4,1.0,1/29/2016,"I hate to write this review. It's a 2 star because the food was good! So my husband and I decided to invite friends and eat at this Applebee's. We ordered the 2 for 20 the artichoke dip, fiesta chicken and chicken fingers and I said I would like to add a desert and right away our server responded ""oh that is not part of the deal"" in a rude condescending voice. I replied "" I know, that is fine!"" He then said he would put the desert in later so it would come out last. Which is was totally fine with me.  We get our food and he comes out with a 3 cheese pasta and fiesta chicken. My husband then says I ordered the chicken fingers, the server then argues and looks at his order book and said no sir that is not what you ordered again in a rude condescending voice. He then takes the food and said we will get you the chicken fingers. Which was nice but if he would have got things the first time he wouldn't have had that miscommunication in the first place. The whole time he treated everyone at our table with the least respect I have ever seen a server treat customers, he in no way went out of the way to please or value our business being there. Oh also he never brought out my dessert he had the audacity to ask if we wanted dessert at the end when he was handing out or checks.  So yes I am disappointed I love Applebee's but I don't know what the deal was with this server tonight and I hope we never get him again. I want to say his name was John and he is the one with small Gage's in his ears. So if you get this server beware!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-higley-3?start=40
Shay M.,"Erie, PA",26,25,5,1.0,4/24/2016,"Besides the multiple disappointments (didn't have items that were on the menu, draft system was out of order, only 2 of 3 meals served, employees congregated at the front with their heads buried in their phones), the restaurant employees crossed the line. One employee intentionally knock the silverware basket on the ground; another did nothing. A third picked up the silverware from the ground, put it the basket and back up on the shelf for service. Less than a minute later a couple walked in and the employee that pick the silverware up off the ground reached into the basket and started to walk the couple to the table. Don't worry, I stepped in and stopped the couple from getting the silverware and asked for the manager. Unfortunately, the manager didn't strike me as someone who would actually follow through and take action. AVOID!!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-higley-3?start=40

Barb J.,"Mesa, AZ",67,10,,1.0,2/24/2015,"I am really disappointed. This was our second time getting to go from this location. It was very disappointing. The mozzarella sticks were not even warm. The bourbon chicken had nearly raw onions instead of caramelized onions, to the point they were not edible. Being that there is an additional charge for the bourbon chicken just raises the frustration. I had a really long day and depended on a $50+ dinner being good and as ordered.

I asked for a med-rare, got well done. The mash potatoes had zero garlic taste in them. The seasonal veggies was just broccoli, which is a veggie (singular), they could have at least added squash or carrots. And the broccoli was just steamed, nothing else, no seasoning at all. The staff were nice but they were not at all busy.

Kimberly G.,"Seattle, WA",150,238,49,3.0,6/6/2013,"I had not been to an Applebee's in over a year until tonight. My family lives out in Queen Creek and our options around there are very limited. We decided tonight on this Applebee's because it was fairly close and the wait was way to long at the Native New Yorker in Queen Creek.  The food was okay. Not bad but not great. The beer prices are great. The service was good. I had jalapeno lime shrimp with rice which had good flavor. My sister had lemon butter fettuccine alfredo with shrimp which she enjoyed. I had not been to an Applebee's in a long time prior to this because I had some really bad experiences at a location in Chandler over a year ago. It seems as though they have changed the menu quite a bit. There are still some staple items that Applebee's has always had but definitely some added items as well. I would say that Applebee's is trying to do too much with this new menu. They have seafood, sandwiches, pasta, chicken, burgers and more it's too much. They should try to do two or three things really good instead of trying to do too many things mediocre. But alas it is a chain. I would visit this location again. It wasn't bad.

My wife ordered an ice tea and got a water then politely reminded that she also wanted ice tea. She never got the ice tea however they charged us for it and then a manager had to get involved to delete it off the check. The portions are very small so the ""low price"" value goes out the window when a entree salad is the size of a side salad.

Waited 50 minutes for our order to be taken. Our party of eight was already seated and knew what we wanted but they only took the drink orders. We were told they were out of French fries when requested as part of the kids meal. The steak was brought raw so they took it back, cooked it, and served it on the exact same plate as the raw steak. Took three tries to finally get a steak that wasn't still moving and a clean plate. We were treating the kids to dessert because the kid's meals had incredibly tiny portions but after almost three hours there we went next door to Walmart to get dessert. While there we saw the general manager buying a cartload of generic frozen French fries.

Non existent service.  Not welcoming at all.  Upon entering the restaurant on Christmas Eve, instead of being greeted, the hostess barked that they were closing soon. and we would need to hurry up ""just so you know.""  When I asked when they closed, I was told in one hour.  Really?!?  One hour and you're turning guests away, especially a party with an elderly couple on Christmas Eve!  SHAME!!!!!! They wouldn't accommodate a basic seating preference for my elderly mother who had trouble walking.  They made her walk to the farthest side of the restaurant!!  Despite that we sat where ordered.  Then we were completely ignored.  Nobody acknowledged us at all.  Servers walked buy several times.  They wouldn't look at us or even take our drink order.  Thank you for ruining a Christmas Eve for my elderly parents.

Carmik T.,"Gilbert, AZ",70,384,751,3.0,12/12/2017,"It's been some time since we've been to an Applebee's. Decided to go-as they'd sent me a Birthday Special. A BOGO deal. Came in Saturday evening 12/ 9 and sat at the bar. Andrew was our server & bartender. Very pleasant & accommodating. I'm going to give this place the benefit of the doubt after seeing many of the negative reviews. I think some are honest and a few others not so much!  I can say we had issues with utensil cleanliness. Prior to our meal we had to asked for another set of forks. Wings came out not as requested, kitchen error and it was resolved in a very professional manner. Those were tasty! Double Crunch, never a bad thing when it comes to crispy chicken & sauce! Ordered the Sirloin Steaks (Butchers Reserve). *Keep in mind for later * that again it's suppose to be the ""Buy one, get one : of equal or lesser value FREE""! Steak Meals were $18.99 each. We ordered 1 medium and the other medium rare. Medium rare my husband felt was over cooked. However, it was a 12 oz ""uneven"" butcher cut, so the thicker piece was medium rare and thinner piece was medium well. My cut was more balanced and cook perfectly. Can order two sides. Both of us had the garlic green beans which are good. I had the baked potato and was asked if I wanted it loaded. ""Sure""! It's $2.99 additional for adding bacon & green onion. When it arrived it had 3 very small pieces of bacon and no green onion? *See Pic* I requested a side of both: since I was paying for it! That request was met with no complaints. My husband had the garlic mashed potatoes & they were good. Both meals we just ok. My son came in a little later with his girlfriend, so we added the sampler platter to our bill that they shared. $13.99 Drinks were pricey $8.50 for vodka tonics (grey goose) NOT a double! LOL Beers weren't at Happy Hour Price even with getting there at just before 6PM. The bartender made reference to that when he served us our first set of drinks. At the end of service when we presented the coupon, the bartender took off the sampler platter? They didn't read their own fine print nor honor the coupon the way it was supposed to be offered. I told my husband it should have been one of our steak meals comp'ed?! He wasn't going to bring it up after the charge had gone through. We still paid over $100!  Applebee's has really deteriorated over the years. From management to staff it just is average in my opinion. A fast food chain that use to be very successful , but over the years has declined. I don't think we will be back anytime soon to dine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-higley-3

Kemlyn B.,"Glendale, AZ",411,510,1842,2.0,8/19/2017,"Poor customer service and food presentation lacking in attention to details. Our family headed to Applebee's near the Mesa Gateway Airport. We always love the Wonton Tacos which drew us here.  It started out well enough. Casey, our server was pleasant and service was customary then. We ordered one entree and 5 appetizers. My daughters split the macaroni and cheese with bacon and honey chicken. They enjoyed it.  Two of our three Wonton Tacos were not finished well. They usually  top the slaw on the tacos. Two of the tacos did not have slaw in it. Another problem with detail was the spinach artichoke dip. The kitchen had left a fairly large woody piece of artichoke in the dip. When Casey came to check on us, she asked, ""How's everything?"" When I asked that she provide feedback to the chef that the tacos were not dressed correctly and there was a large chunk of woody artichoke in my dip. She scoffed at me and rolled her eyes dismissively. ""Okay."" she said and walked off.  Training. I know that she was probably trained by management to ask customers how everything was going, but if servers are not interested in feedback then should at least pretend to be pleasant. Also, if you don't want feedback, don't ask the servers to ask customers how things are going. We left the restaurant disappointed with the service.

With the music it came as no sunrise that the food order came out totally incorrect. After trying to stomach through the wrongly prepared item, I had to regrettably send it back. After 2 minutes it came back corrected with the quality parallel to Taco Bell.

Sherrie F.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,2,,4.0,1/8/2015,"Love coming to this Applebee's on Power and Ray because the food is great for a chain restaurant and the staff is always nice.  I recently tried one of their new Under 600 calorie dishes. Let me just say, you have to try the Cedar Lemon Chicken. The chicken was so tender and it came with diced cucumbers and green apples on top with a light lemon sauce. The rice was a blend of white rice, quinoa (not sure I spelled that right) cranberries, and pecans! YUM!!! Think I found my new favorite dish. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-higley-3?start=60
Kara R.,"Mesa, AZ",4,23,6,1.0,1/28/2016,"Probably the worst experience I have ever had at at a restaurant and I didn't even get to eat. We walk in, obviously they are busy people are sitting in the front and waiting. The hostess were not friendly. They don't greet you. I was stared at with a look of disdain and annoyance when our table was finally ready twenty minutes later, I didn't mind, we knew we had to wait she just walked us back and left... Didn't ask us if we needed a high chair for any of my kids or anything. Just left. We sat there another fifteen minutes and not a single person stopped by. We stared at many workers yet no one heeded our dear in the headlights look. Finally, one of the hostess, k*****, was behind us clearing a table. I simply said ""excuse me, it had been over fifteen minutes and no one has come by our table"" Another look of annoyance and then a very rude Response with a snippy attitude. I asked for her manager who just so happened to be right behind her. I told her of my experiences thus far and then decided to leave. Upon leaving k***** was upfront whispering with her blonde minion. I asked for her name and she held up her name tag and said ""yeah! It's K*****!"" In a very hostile manner. I let the manager know, but obviously this girl has somewhat of a free range because she has no issues being a complete c word to customers. I will never go to an apple bees again. Ever.

Lindsay H.,"Youngstown, OH",149,222,410,3.0,9/3/2015,"Fresh, tasty takeout experience. I see that many of the poor reviews are service-related. We have never eaten in the restaurant but had decent carryout which we ordered online via their website. However, no host was waiting upon arrival and hubby had to stand and ask around awkwardly to find out where to go for pick up (in the back. Go through side entrance). We live about 10 minutes away and they estimated 15 minutes for the following food to be ready: -2 item app combo: crispy green beans and pretzels with beer cheese and honey mustard -American Standard burger with BBQ fries -4-cheese Mac with honey pepper chicken Everything arrived home hot, fresh and crispy (where applicable). The green beans came without the advertised aioli, so we used ranch from home. They were tasty and did not have as much breading as the Friday's version, in a crispy delish way. The pretzels were ""meh"" but the accompanying beer cheese was awesome.  The burger was good but couldn't taste the bacon, pickles and onion that was minced and mixed/cooked into the patty. We wish that it would have come with lettuce and tomatoes like the other burgers. Ordered well done but was cooked medium.  The Mac and cheese was pretty good and a hearty helping (I have about 1/2 for leftovers). The cheese sauce is nothing unique but I like the use of callentani noodles and the bacon (which I almost asked to omit) was crispy and a welcome change of texture. The chicken sounded a bit lame... ""honey pepper chicken strip?"" I imagined them throwing a chicken strip that had been sitting under a heat lamp on top and calling it a day. The chicken was actually really tasty. Obviously crispy but the sweet/salty combo was great with the creaminess of the pasta. I wish they had they had the option of adding veggies to make it more of a complete, adult dish. We added leftover stir-fried zuchinni, peppers and broccoli and it jazzed it up a bit. The breadstick was pretty old and tasteless and not worth the calories. While it was pretty good, I don't think I would get this again. I will go back to my usual Oriental Chicken Salad or club house grill. Worth a try once, though.  All-in all, it was fresh, well made food. Some of the best carry out we have had in the last year. They offer both car delivery and you going into the carry out area in the back. Just bring cash for a tip for the car service. *edit: we ordered take out again and were there while food was still being prepared. Even so, taco app was soggy and fries were dry, cold and stale. It was clear that they did not time our meal prep properly. Bummer!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-higley-3?start=20
Jamie L.,"Gilbert, AZ",1,64,4,1.0,2/4/2016,"So... as many of you know by now- and I now know about myself- apparently(!) I am masochistic and I love to be abused by mediocre establishments. My husband and I ordered Applebee's to go *gulp*  yet again. Traffic was heavy so we weren't perfectly timed when the stuff came out of the... Oven? Microwave?... er... you get the idea. We get home and the food is cold as all get out. (Some how pizza guys can manage to keep the pies hot... but I digress...). The big problem is we did the '2 for $20' special (you know, the one managers here don't think exist) and my husband's fries were missing. And we don't exactly live a hop, skip, and a jump away. Plus my husband has school to be at in a half an hour. So we call and they put us on the phone with some wretched manager named 'Janie'. And Janie is just aghast apparently that a customer would have the nerve to talk to her... let alone complain! Janie has to get the kitchens side of the story because we all know... the customer is NEVER right and their side of the story should NEVER be heard before the staff! She could barely listen to our side first. Janie is unapologetic, unfriendly, and tries to blame us for this. I guess I missed my second job shift as a cook back there. Or maybe I was supposed to be the car side-to-go guy... Well. She says we can come back... Sorry lady- can't do that unless you want to fill my gas tank and sit in a class for my husband. Then she says she can't void a single item on the receipt. But, my husband asks, she could void the transaction altogether and charge us for what we had minus the burger meal. Ummm... well.... Then she hangs up in my husband's face-- or do those landlines get really bad reception these days? Er. Okay so he has to go to school so I call back within a few minutes and the rude guy who answers the phone already knows we are calling and magically and just as unexpected as  a unicorn parted the sky with glittery rainbows the manager has evaporated and is now in a meeting with 'another manager'. And I am beyond pissed off at this point and tell him that is unacceptable, I need to speak to her, and I will wait. After throwing that curve ball that they totally did not plan for because the hang up was like totally an accident *end sarcasm* he tells me she is just going to void the transaction. And he has attitude galore and is totally unprofessional but considering who his manager is... am I suprised? NO. But I am still yelping about it. ;) So, the point is, from my perspective, they have messed up more than a handful of times over the past year or so and the management clearly has not implemented any changes, they do not apologize still, and they certainly do not try to rectify any wrong doings. I mean, at least TRY to problem solve. Like offer us a replacement meal in the future (and follow through for once), or offer a future desert/appetizer... but because I am NOT interested in freebies- just suck it up and apologize (because you are the manager at a resteraunt- your skin needs to be a little thicker than that) and offer to take off the meal that went wrong (no matter the logistics because we all know it can be done- if there is a will there is a way!!!). I hate to be the one to tell Applebee's staff this... but... us customers are the reason your doors are open and you have a paycheck. If no one comes to your establishment and they tell their friends not to go because you suck... who then tell their friends you are awful... who Yelp about how you deserve a NEGATIVE 3 STAR RATING... eventually doors will start closing, investors will get all upset and go elsewhere, and then another mediocre neighborhood grill will take your place. If you don't want that to happen: change your ways. My advice to Yelpers: Gilbert has some pretty awesome places to eat- please give your money to the places that deserve your time and money- and DO NOT eat here. Whatever excuse you are thinking in your head about why Applebee's is still okay- you are only fooling yourself. This place is leagues below other nearby venues. The end. Now I am going to go feed my cold, tiny, soggy chicken tenders to my dog if you don't mind. Oh wait.
