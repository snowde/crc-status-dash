Tiffany P.,"Birmingham, AL",183,40,46,4.0,11/24/2017,"This is probably my 3rd time being at this Applebees.  1st time was for lunch with a friend & it was great.  2nd time was a late night dessert run. The sweets were good but we ended up getting our meal comped because a little roach decided to start crawling next to our table.  they were really apologetic & the manager on duty came by. Something about construction in the back idk.  3rd time was today. We actually gave it another try and all was well. I definitely said a longer than normal grace before my meal this time just in case ‍  We got the half price apps, steak & potatoes & steak stir-fry. They all were delicious. The sirachi shrimp was really good , not spicy at all. Sorta like bang bang shrimp without the bang.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hoover-2
Chelsea C.,"Pensacola, FL",594,35,5,1.0,11/27/2017,Gave this place a try several times and each time had something foreign in our food.  How does that even happen? ‍ Plastic in ice cream... A part of a nutritional label fried and in our chips...  The paper that separates cheese slices on burger...  Several different occasions...  I just don't get it but not one to complain or cause a scene at the restaurant.  So will just leave it here... beware.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hoover-2
Scott H.,"Birmingham, AL",112,154,32,4.0,12/5/2017,"Have been here several times and every time has been point on. The last two times it seemed fairly crowded but the service was spot on. The last time I went, I went and sat at the bar. Erica took care of me, and had great customer service skills. She told me she was running the bar and doing the carside pickup. I was shocked at the way she was handling and keeping all the patrons pleased.  The only minus to this place is the handicapped parking is over to the side and parking is few and far between if you get there during their peak times, so I suggest going during the senior hours 3-5pm if you are able to. Enjoy this place. I sure do.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hoover-2
Jan A.,"Adamsville, AL",11,54,104,3.0,12/10/2017,We picked here to eat because they will accommodate for large part is.  You can order off the regular menu and everyone can pay for their own ticket.  So if you call about 1 hour before and let them know you are coming.  They will set up for you.  The food was average and the service was good.  Overall it was ok,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hoover-2
Samuel P.,"Center Point, AL",165,273,773,3.0,9/23/2017,"Who in their right mind doesn't like happy hour? What I've notice here and the Applebee's in Trussville is that they truly support there city high school football team. We got here a little after 6 and regarding them being busy, we didn't have to wait for a table. Most hostess don't engage with customer, but the hostess that even was pleasant to talk to and she even complimented me on my tee shirt. Like I mention before, they have good deal on appetizer during happy hour which you have to be crazy to pass up. One of the appetizer my friends ended up getting was the mozzarella sticks and I tried one of their and lets just say they definitely melt in your mouth type good. I didn't want nothing on the main menu, so I just order the pick 3 appetizer for $10.99 which I went with a steak quesadilla, buffalo boneless wings and wontons chicken tacos. The steak quesadilla and the boneless wings were good, but I wasn't a fan of the wontons tacos. My problem with it is they added cold coleslaw on top of the dish. I believe that putting the coleslaw on the taco made the whole dish cold. I waitress was really nice and check on periodic during our time here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hoover-2
Reginald D.,"Birmingham, AL",18,211,348,3.0,7/22/2016,One of the things that I noticed was that their were a lot of new items on the menu to choose from I like going to places with a lot of things to choose from I  really liked this like this Applebees its in a great location and for a Friday night it wasn't busy at all which I liked the it didn't take long for the food to come out customer service was good i had got the pub Philly sandwich which was a new item  and it was alright,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hoover-2
Jack F.,"Birmingham, AL",0,7,,5.0,6/27/2017,I meet friends here for happy hour and other times a couple times a week. The happy hours drink and food deals are great- and regular times too. The management and staff go all out to give a great experience and if your order is not perfect they go all out to make you happy. I've enjoyed going here for years and will continue.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hoover-2
Tad N.,"Hoover, AL",95,405,243,4.0,1/6/2016,Applebee's is a chain bar food place.  Atmosphere - clean and I have always liked the decorations.  Staff - happy and attentive.  Food - I like the food. I don't lay awake at night dreaming about it but it's good. Milkshakes are great. Some appetizers are a must for me(cheese sticks). I know some people have had bad service here but I never have. I recommend this place when you just don't want to cook. It's also nice for a night out when you want to hear the other person talk.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hoover-2
Melody H.,"Birmingham, AL",21,131,9,2.0,7/21/2016,"Three of us dined at Applebee's last night.  We arrived around 8:30pm.  The hostess seemed like she was either very tired or very bored.  We were seated and our waitress came to take our drink order. Our drinks were delivered quickly, but I needed a minute to peruse the menu.  We all ordered and then waited.  Our food was delivered - and while everyone else at the table was happy, I certainly was not.  I ordered the sirloin stir-fry and it was not even close to being as advertised.  A few limp veggies, the sirloin unevenly cut and cooked, there was BACON in it (which was not listed on the menu) and odd bits of what looked like burned meat. I'm usually not one to complain or send anything back, but there was no way to salvage that.  They asked if I wanted them to make something else, but I just told them I wanted it taken off our ticket.   I've been to this Applebee's before and the food was pretty good.  We learned later by overhearing the bartender (and being told by our waitress) that the kitchen staff was all new so they weren't very familiar with the menu.  Yeah, it showed. I might give the place another chance, but it will probably be a while.  That stir-fry was just THAT bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hoover-2
Jason B.,"Birmingham, AL",26,112,186,4.0,11/11/2015,I have ate at many applebees. This is one of the best. They have plenty of staff so your wait is short. Food was fresh and good. I did have to ask for a refill once. They have different deals every night. Wednesday is wing and pitcher night. I would highly recommend this restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hoover-2
Mike B.,"Atlanta, GA",16,21,62,5.0,1/11/2017,"I typically don't review chain restaurants and, until tonight, I've not visited an Applebees worth it. That's not at all fair as I tend to frequent Applebees as a traveling salesman. This location in Hoover is different. It all boils down to service. I was heartily welcomed at the door (it was well after 9:00) and at the bar. The bartender was excellent, the food was great, the vibe was fun and I'll definitely be returning. Well done Applebees Hoover!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hoover-2
Randy F.,"Hoover, AL",99,109,274,2.0,5/27/2015,"I tried... I was not impressed with the food, but the service was fine.  The Asian Tacos was pretty, but was served luke warm. Great location though and lots of parking!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hoover-2
Peaches H.,"Helena, AL",0,6,,5.0,7/6/2016,Best Applebee's in the Birmingham area and the new wood fired grill menu just made them even better. The service here at lunch time is fantastic. They will get you in and out quickly if you are in a hurry but let them know you are in no hurry and they won't bother you.  You have to try the new crispy bacon cheddar potatoes. Its an amazing side dish that's like a loaded baked potato cooked on a wood fired grill and pre-sliced for you. AMAZING.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hoover-2
Dakota S.,"Mobile, AL",37,7,,1.0,1/4/2016,"SOS don't eat here! This is the worst applebees I have ever been to period!  I am white and on 3 separate Occasions we have seem racism against black people! 1). They only 1 person sang happy birthday to this black couple, the white couple had everyone in the place singing 2) they refused to give an entire black party of 12 silverware!  Not to mention the there was 15 mins left in happy hour and our waitress tried to hold our drinks till happy hour was over. So we walked out! They will let you order car side to go and never walk out! Hell I wrote this review while I was waiting!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hoover-2
Kiana W.,"Montgomery, AL",0,5,4,1.0,10/3/2016,"Well, let me say this the manager did her best to make things right. She comp the my meal in the end and removed a item ordered. There were three of us, one family member being a child who food looked liked it was the kids potion, although I ordered the adult version. Nothing I mean nothing we ordered was prepared properly, plated properly, or made properly. They could not even locate my fiance football game and then we learned that no one even attempted to look. The only thing that was good was our waitress Katilynn, other than that I and my family will not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hoover-2

Emily J.,"Birmingham, AL",0,1,3,1.0,6/4/2015,I am highly up set with the service here. This was not what I was expecting this evening. I would say I'm surprised but I'm not. We've had many problems here before and this will be the last one. If I wanted what they presented to me tonight I would have cooked myself.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hoover-2
Cindy K.,"Birmingham, AL",112,59,155,4.0,7/6/2014,"I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants but I have to give this one tops. We were greeted by numerous employees and even had the door opened when we walked in.  Being on a regimented diet I was pleased to see numerous dishes with the calories listed. This made my choice so much easier than trying to mentally calculate the calories in each dish. It's refreshing to know that you can get a healthy, tasty dish that consists of more than a salad.  Our waitress was courteous and provided just the right amount of attention without being to obtrusive. Hats off to a great meal and good service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hoover-2
Kevin W.,"Birmingham, AL",41,217,46,4.0,1/19/2016,"This place is close to home and everything I've tried there is better above average. Some of it not much and nothing will blow you away but it's clean, the staff is courteous and the food and cocktails are good to very good.  Did I say it was close and convenient? :)   Don't expect a white table, 100$ plate experience and you'll be fine here.  I read another review that said he saw blatant racism.  I'm scratching my head over that one.  The staff is made up of at least half if not more Africa Americans.  The customer base, for some reason on certain nights, is made of of almost entirely African Americans.  The diversity of the staff and customers is a plus for me, not a negative and I've only been treated and seen people treated well in our numerous visits.  Nice, reasonably priced local chain restaurant.  Some nights it may be three starts but we've been enough to level up.  It's much more likely to be four.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hoover-2

Karen S.,"Hanford, CA",33,13,,4.0,4/23/2016,"After a disappointing visit at another chain restaurant,  I was very happy with Applebee's. The hostess was pleasant and always working (cleaning tables for the next guest, etc). My server was very nice and attentive. He asked several times if I needed anything. I had their bourbon steak and it was cooked the way I asked. The one thing that they could improve is that I usually order steak medium rare, so when they brought it on the sizzling skillet, I knew I had to move it off the skillet. Not a deal breaker. Everyone was working together to serve all of their guests. Applebee's is consistent. I was sad that they retired the green bean crispers. It was one of my favorites.  Good people,  good food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hoover-2?start=20
Kathie H.,"Mobile, AL",3,16,5,1.0,11/4/2014,"I cannot remember when I had a meal that was this bad it was horrible . The  only good part  was our waitress who tried so very hard.  How can you possibly ruin a simple grilled chicken salad?  they managed.  Half of the lettuce was black, the fresh strawberries obviously frozen and just pure mush, avocadoes was mush and black it was disgusting! I love kids so don't get me wrong but we were surrounded on all sides with families of screaming kids.  It made it impossible to have a conversation. If you want a quiet enjoyable meal this is definitely not the place to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hoover-2?start=20
Tonya K.,"Trussville, AL",58,34,111,2.0,7/4/2014,"I know it is the 4th of July but do we just throw standards out the window. First off we just left a bad experience and here comes another!  The waiter was very nice and he was doing his best to make up for the bar and the kitchens mistakes.  The Long Island Tea was just watered down and had no flavor. I sent it back and switched to a margarita. Applebee's margaritas have a high acidity content that comes from their very sour mix, I don't order these here often for this very reason.  The kitchen sent out the orders and two out of the three were wrong and was missing shrimp from one order. I of course am doing without due to the drink mix up. I will get something later.... All in all not one of our better nights. Not a happy camper and I hope the nights gets better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hoover-2?start=20

Daniel F.,"Birmingham, AL",147,10,2,3.0,7/22/2015,"Wife and I ate here on July 21st for their Free App and Free Desert day. They were extremely crowded which we expected. However, our waitress seemed really new or not there. She rarely came to our table and looked like she was wandering around aimlessly. To top it off she specifically stated the salad comes with the entree and at the end of the meal, I was billed for the salad and an extra $2.50 was added on to our bill for no apparent reason.  All in all, we were extremely happy with how the Manager handled it when we brought it to his attention. No questions asked and refunded the portion in which we were billed and shouldn't have been. I will go back because of how he handled it. He could have asked questions, but he didn't. It was very professional and how a manger should react when faced with that circumstance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hoover-2?start=20
Palmer W.,"Birmingham, AL",0,4,,5.0,4/2/2016,I had dinner with a couple of friends. Our waiter was a young man by the name of Phillip he was an excellent server. He was very attentive to our needs.
