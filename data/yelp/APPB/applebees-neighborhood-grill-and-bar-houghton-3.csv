Direct V.,"Minneapolis, MN",8,4,,3.0,9/30/2017,"Waitress seemed mad to be there and acted like it pained her to wait on us.  A bummer because I was trying to enjoy a rare outing with nieces but she made us uncomfortable, wondering what we did wrong.  We were polite but asking for the undelivered gravy = huffed away with a silent grim face to get it; a couple more people seated with us by the hostess = ""oh we have 3 more people?"" No welcome.  Kitchen (at least she blamed the kitchen) forgot half my lunch combo so we waited for that after my nieces were done eating and ansy to leave.  Would it kill her to smile?  No because she forced some out with the bill.   Ate most of my meal with no soda. I know people have bad days so I tried to feel empathetic but maybe she was being funny as apparently she is known for a strange sense of humor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-houghton-3
S C.,"Whitmore Lake, MI",0,60,52,2.0,9/4/2017,What can I say the fact there are leftovers say a lot! I am not sure what it was. It this lacked in so many ways! Was not worth the $47.00.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-houghton-3
Tomas S.,"Houghton, MI",0,2,,4.0,1/12/2018,"Honestly love Applebee's, the staff is friendly. The prices are fair. If you want good drinks and good appetizers with the gang this is the place to go. I've rarely been disappointed with this restaurant. The food is pretty good quality but could be a little better. But all in all I enjoy it",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-houghton-3
Jessica G.,"Lake Linden, MI",0,4,,1.0,3/7/2017,"Overpriced for reheated food. Steak flavor was okay...there was a hair in my mashed potatoes. I didn't mention it as we just wanted to get out of there! Waitress was horrible, complaining about her long shift. Just won't go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-houghton-3
Gina S.,"Austin, TX",67,35,60,2.0,7/23/2014,Salmon was over cooked and dry. Veggies were wilted beyond recognition. Onion soup was good as well as the goddess wedge.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-houghton-3
Tiffany S.,"Las Vegas, NV",104,9,1,5.0,8/22/2014,"After a horrible experience at an Applebee's in Nebraska, I have sworn to never eat at any Applebee's again! However, my mother in law is visiting and she really wanted to eat lunch at Applebee's today. This Applebee's truly impressed me! The staff was nice and the food was really good! Not to mention our waitress was very good! We had an appetizer, drinks, and two create your own lunch specials.... Everything was delicious and we left with full and happy bellies.   Needless to say, I will return :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-houghton-3
Carole R.,"Hancock, MI",24,90,2,3.0,4/17/2015,"I don't expect much from a chain restaurant. This Applebee's is fine if you are bored with other places. Their tap lines are perpetually in need of cleaning, but they have some interesting mix drink options. The service was fast and friendly in my experiences.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-houghton-3
Evan L.,"Edgar, WI",0,13,2,5.0,4/4/2015,"Food was great, service was great. We have been here three times in 6 months and has always been very good despite other Yelpers! The nachos brisket salsa Verde were excellente!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-houghton-3
Marc E.,"North Las Vegas, NV",79,127,29,1.0,6/27/2014,"Went here for happy hour and half off appetizers with some friends and everyone came home and complained of stomach problems. The drinks were good and the appetizers were ok, but we all could have done without the stomach cramps and nausea. I will not be going back here again. It was an awful experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-houghton-3
Jillian F.,"Calumet, MI",29,34,2,1.0,7/1/2012,"I gave up on this Applebees over a year ago after my husband and I were seated, then ignored. We sat there and watched a couple come in five minutes behind us, get their drink right away, then their order taken. Not ONE person ever even came up to us. Not even drinks.We sat there for about 15 minutes,....at this point as a joke to see hoe long it would take. After that, I was pissed! We walked out and the door girl said ""Hope you enjoyed your dinner"",....I just laughed and said ""We were ignored, but thanks for asking!"" Stupid us, we tried again not that long ago. We were served this time, but nothing to brag about. Mediocre at best. The food is always too much. Over seasoned to hind the nasty food. Just not worth it. I would only suggest going here if you are young, single, college guy that is just looking for a cute, stupid college girl, and a bottled beer! Don't get the on tap flat beer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-houghton-3
Eugene K.,"Houghton, MI",0,1,,2.0,7/13/2015,The half off apps are a cheap alternative to microwave apps from walmart. Overall a good buy if you are drunk.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-houghton-3
Matthew P.,"Lansing, MI",0,1,,3.0,1/16/2013,"Some waiters were really nice, some just wanted to get you out of the door...food was pretty good (honey bbq boneless wings), long island ice tea was pretty weak...not even a buzz and I drink about once a month...long island from the library made me quite tipsy 3 weeks ago. Overall was slghtly better than okay.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-houghton-3
Rob W.,"Indian River, MI",13,9,1,1.0,9/25/2012,"Not recommended at all! Service from walking in the door should have been a hint. Not welcoming at all!! Walked in at 10:30 pm to get a quick bit to eat (sign says 11pm closed) I even said at the door ""sorry so late can we please get a quick bit?"". Cold sholder, I felt was incorect, especially when a company advertises ""late night 1/2 off apps"". Food awful and may I add a toothpick in my friends salad! I don't know how this place is managing other than it is a chain! Please take my advise and do not eat here especially if your looking for a family, enviting staff!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-houghton-3
Kongfu P.,"Milwaukee, WI",1,7,2,5.0,12/8/2013,"Surprise to see these bad reviews. This is one of my favorite restaurants in houghton. Much better than others, like joes seafood.....nice waiter, nice food, nice service, reasonable price, nothing to complain...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-houghton-3
