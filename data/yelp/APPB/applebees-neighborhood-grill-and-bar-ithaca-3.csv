Miranda L.,"Tokyo, Japan",59,539,331,4.0,7/5/2015,"A solid part of the Applebees chain. Ordered the two for $20 and had Mozzarella Sticks and the 7 oz. Sirloin with Mashed Potatoes. The meal was made quickly, hot, and tasty. I've had the same meal at other Applebees and this was quite impressive. Same layout and decor as the last few years, but the servers are prompt and friendly. I only get to return to the area a few times a year, and this is a great choice for a quick meal, especially with a group.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ithaca-3
Matthew R.,"King Ferry, NY",2,27,20,3.0,5/9/2017,"Typical chain type service. Not particularly personable staff, more cold shoulder and bull through tasks type of service. The staff seems to cringe when the general manager walks into the room, I also notice a constant and significant staff turnover here, sad to see.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ithaca-3
Matthew T.,"Seneca Falls, NY",12,5,,1.0,10/25/2017,"Very disappointing service. Took more than 10 minutes from being seated to get someone to take our drink order. Our waiter James was very rushed with us as if he did not want to have us seated in his section. It wasn't till we were finished with our meal that he even checked back to see if we wanted a refill on our drinks. At one point he came to the table asking if he should put in our to go order, which we had none, and he wandered away very confused. At the end of the meal he brought the check and said you didn't want dessert right and set the check on the table.  The food was good, the hostess was very pleasant, the restaurant was not very busy.  Unfortunately, this is not the first time I have had incredibly poor service from James. I have not been to this particular Applebee's in quite a while specifically because of This particular server, and I really can't see myself going back anytime soon.  My schedule brings me into this area every Wednesday and I have to cross an otherwise favorite establishment off my list of dining choices.   It's a shame.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ithaca-3
Meghan W.,"Clinton, NY",2,12,11,1.0,7/13/2017,"Dear Applebee's... why is everything lukewarm? Honestly your food tastes like you don't own a stove or an oven and you just toss everything in a microwave and bring it out in 30 seconds flat. I ate here out of desperation, and I regret it. I would have been better off eating easy Mac from the hotel convenience store. Never eating at another Applebees again. As I'm writing this, I already feel queasy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ithaca-3
Stephanie G.,"Baltimore, MD",0,26,20,1.0,10/2/2016,"The food was terrible but I was also surprised at how bad the service was. The server (a guy) seemed so annoyed and unhappy to be there (i went at 10pm so maybe he was tired) but the service was horrible and the food disappointing. The prices were food but I should've just gotten frozen dinner from tops down the street, it would have been the same and cheaper",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ithaca-3
Keigo I.,"West New York, NJ",5,94,189,4.0,4/14/2015,"Just a normal Applebee's . Compare to the normal one, here is quieter You can see the pictures of Cornell students are everywhere",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ithaca-3
Aperion D.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,1,,5.0,2/24/2017,"A regular Applebee's you'll find anywhere else. I ordered a To-Go order, it came out promptly and tasted great. The bartender took my order and displayed great customer service by asking if I wanted something to drink and updated me with how my order was coming along. I'd come here the next time I visit Ithaca from California. I recommend this place to any Ithaca/Cornell visitors- can't really go wrong with Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ithaca-3
Lee v.,"Ithaca, NY",2,24,80,4.0,9/15/2014,"Very friendly, bubbly staff.  Most of the dishes are very tasty with a few exceptions. I've been about 20 times in the last 11 years. Have never had a bad experience. They are always very accommodating.  I love that they have Weight Watchers choices. All the WW choices I've had have been very tasty with the exception of the new Chicken Freshcado which was a total miss. There was no flavor or spice and it was lacking acidity and salt.  I wish they would bring back WE dessert choices.  My beau had the All You Can Eat Ribs Chipotle flavor and was very happy with them and the seasoned fries.  The spinach & artichoke dip was also a dud lacking substance and flavor.  Boneless wings were good.  Our apps came out after 18-22 minutes I'd guess. My BF complained to me but not staff when waiting cause he was hungry.  After they came out 2 different managers came out and profusely apologized for the delay. We hadn't and didn't complain to staff at all so were surprised when the first offered ""adjustment to check"". Then the 2nd manager that came over told us he was going to ""take care of the meal"" for us which we didn't really understand exactly what that meant but weren't going to complain. He even threw in extra chips and salsa in our to go bag.  At the end we were waiting for our check and waiting again to see what discount would be and the waitress finally explained there was no check as the whole thing had been comped. Apps, beers, milkshake, entrees and all. We were surprised and confused. It seemed overly accommodating like maybe they mistook us for celebrities or mucky-mucks. Ha ha. We still gave the waitress a $10 tip as she has to make a living. We are still perplexed at this ?new customer service initiative but as my friend said "" don't look a gift horse in the mouth"" and since 2 of them items didn't taste good I'm glad I didn't have to pay for them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ithaca-3
Marlene D.,"Sacramento, CA",17,23,1,4.0,5/21/2016,"We are from Cali and have become accustomed to a certain level of quality and customer service. This AB is great!! Great food, excellent excellent customer service. The steak just melted in my mouth! Sweet potato fries were perfectly cooked, cheeseburger rolls dangerous! Piece-de-resistance is the APPLE CHIMI-CHEESECAKE (warm cinnamon baked apples, cream cheese filling, rolled in a fluffy pastry shell and served with homemade vanilla ice cream drizzled with Carmel sauce. I have had this dessert more times than I can count and I have NEVER been disappointed.  Overall the experience was divine!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ithaca-3
Judy A.,"Clyde, NY",29,4,,4.0,9/26/2015,"We both had bourbon steak, mashed potatoes and salad. Food was very good and so was the service. Our only complaints were the cups of dressing was two small and we had a VERY difficult time trying to find the restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ithaca-3
Claudio G.,"West Bloomfield Township, MI",0,5,,2.0,6/11/2016,Bartender service in the afternoon was well below satisfactory.  Brought my drinks promptly but then disappeared for while as I sat waiting to order while waitstaff passed left and right.  Maybe they are more concerned about prepping for the dinner crowd that they don't need to worry about the mid-meal customers.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ithaca-3
Justin V.,"Ithaca, NY",21,143,13,4.0,6/16/2014,"This is the only Applebees I like. I've been to like, 5 others and they all are terrible but this place, they have it nailed when it comes to food and service usually. I usually list details of food but I'll just tell you some of the things that keep me coming back: Chicken Tender Platter (have them toss the tenders in the Honey Pepper sauce, you won't regret it!) Oriental Chicken Salad (so good) Feista Chicken Chop Salad (amazing cilantro lime dressing!) Chicken Wonton Tacos (quite possibly the best app in the history of apps!) I've tried some other stuff that can be hit or miss like the quesadilla burger, the tortilla gets soggy too quickly before you are done eating the burger, the mac and cheese is too cheesy, it can make your mouth feel too caked in cheese. The potato twisters can be too greasy but the queso is amazing! The Spinach Artichoke dip is awesome, the boneless wings are good, but are just boneless wings. The Southwest Eggrolls are awesome! Overall this place is my go to 2 for $20 place and I keep coming back. The service is usually spot on, the prices are good and I actually like the atmosphere. Anyways, this is the only applebees in my opinion, love it here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ithaca-3
Michelle B.,"Birmingham, AL",51,231,1,3.0,9/18/2013,"I generally steer clear of Applebee's, just because we have so many better options in Atlanta. The food is usually bland, portions too large, etc. But, we were in Ithaca for a wedding, staying right nearby at the Ramada, and starving/delirious from a 15 hour drive. So, we sucked it up and went to Applebee's. Most of the 3 stars are for the staff. Super friendly, helpful, and our order was correct and fast. I almost always get the Oriental Chicken Salad when I go, and it was just as good here as anywhere. I really like the new grilled chicken option for this salad that comes with an Asian-style sauce, so that you don't end up with just plain old grilled chicken. The regular portion was too large for me to finish in one meal, and I'm a big eater. It also had a LOT of cabbage. My husband had a turkey club and fries - totally edible but not very memorable, as most Applebee's food is. They do serve Pepsi products here, which I really was sad about as I was dying for a Coke Zero. I had to remind myself I was not in Coke Country anymore!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ithaca-3
Kevin L.,"Ithaca, NY",0,45,,4.0,4/8/2013,"Try white peach sangria if you like light alcoholic drinks if you're there. Also, the brownie bites are a good deal if you want a bit of desserts (only a dollar). The food is okay. But the staff are friendly and always welcoming, so expect to walk out of the restaurant pretty happy after your meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ithaca-3
Daniel Dillon C.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,96,8,3.0,12/20/2012,"The whole reason I write reviews is to help other students on tight budgets think up fun date ideas--it's a niche perspective, but an important one given the supposed decline of that particular social phenomenon.  Using that lens, Applebee's needs to be revived as a serious contender. It's true the entrees are unholy--packed with sodium and cheese, and spliced together into veritable Frankendishes of American fare in huge proportions, but some of the straightforward items in the 2 for 20$ deal, which also gets you an appetizer, are not bad. Case in point: the sirloin steak. Drinks here are sugar-loaded, and sometimes I wonder if some wonk could compute Applebee's contribution to US diabetes prevalence. The ambiance fits kitch to a tee, but the Ithaca location has some local flair to differentiate it. The service is consistently decent and can sometimes even be good.  The real thing to do, as other reviewers have hinted at, is to go see a late-night movie, then head to Applebee's for half-off wings. There's something romantic and reassuring about walking hand-in-hand late at night through a desolate parking lot in a non-descript suburban wasteland to Applebee's after taking in the latest Hollywood soma...I mean film. You realize in those moments that you need someone real, and you appreciate your partner's quirks more than ever. They become even more human and their company is especially comforting against an American cultural landscape that can seem positively soul-crushing at other times.   In short, it is completely possible to go to Applebee's, enjoy your time there, and walk out without having turned into a zombie. Your capacity to read and interpret Foucault etc will not be diminished by consuming a Bahama Mama and some Wonton Tacos-- I promise.  (Also, Applebee's is actually a great place to watch sports games).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ithaca-3
Kevin Jiseup K.,"New York, NY",870,262,13,3.0,12/25/2011,"Although there's nothing amazing about Applebee's, we all know that Applebee's is always dependable. I usually try to avoid coming here for any form of dinner because I don't think it's worth the price, however the happy hour appetizers from 11am to 7pm and 10pm to until closing (usually midnight) are totally worth it when you're feeling the munchies. At night, those half-off boneless wings and the spinach & artichoke dip totally hit the spot. I do admit though, I'm speaking from the point of view of a starving college kid. Service has never been horrible here, even when i go with big parties.  Conclusion: You know what you're getting with Applebee's, but I don't think that's always a bad thing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ithaca-3
Vinny N.,"New York, NY",16,50,2,3.0,5/26/2011,"And here we are.  I was visited for work and thought what the heck, its been years and years since I visited and I'm curious.  The menu is still as nuts as ever; layers of stuff on top of each other like Shrimp & Parmesan on top of Steak; why? what good can come of that flavor? B    Mozzarella Sticks -  the sauce is very ketchupy.   B+   Beef Sandwich - Surprisingly good.  I would actually order this again.  It's a total safe bet.  It's just like a brisket with barbecue sauce and the onion strings on top where great! Something weird about the food in general here was that nothing was completely hot.  Some of the mozzarella sticks where half hard and the fries with the sandwich were luke-warm.  There weren't that many people in the place... Do they make everything on the menu and just keep it out under heat-lamps? If this was any other restuarant I'd give it a 2... but its Applebee's I knew what I was walking into.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ithaca-3
Greg S.,"Ithaca, NY",1,133,,2.0,6/20/2012,"OK, so I hate to sound so negative right out of the gate, so I'll say it first; This Applebee's is consistent.  Unfortunately, it's consistently disappointing.  Consistently slow.  Consistently making me wish that I ate elsewhere.   I had a gift card for Applebee's, so my wife and I went to this location for lunch in early May, 2012, only to discover that they were ""renovating"" for two days, but offered us coupons for free appetizers upon our return.  Turns out there's an awful lot of tiny print on those freebies, including an expiration date just a hair over a month from the date they were given to us.  Needless to say, we didn't get appetizer's....on the house, or otherwise. We went on to order our lunch, and I ordered a Reuben sandwich with a side of onion rings.  The food took a long time to arrive, and I recall that from a previous visit.  The food was OK.  Not bad, but underwhelming for sure.  Not that I expected gourmet dining.....I knew where we were.  I just wish it was as good as it could be.  And offering customers who are turned away and cheap appetizer that they end up beating you out of anyway just leaves a crappy taste in my mouth.  So much so that I will make a point of telling my father to please not buy me any more Applebee's gift cards.  They are virtually worthless to me.  I'll sell them on line, or re-gift them to someone I don't necessarily care for!  Pass on this place......life is too short to eat here, and there are other, better places nearby.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ithaca-3
Mick B.,"Manhattan, NY",927,221,494,3.0,3/26/2012,"I've only ever used the car-side to-go service, and I've never had to wait.

Last week, my mom and I ate here for dinner, and it was A LOT worse than I ever remembered it. I ordered a salad with pecan crusted chicken, which tasted good, but when I got home about an hour later, I had really bad stomach pains and I was sick.....can anyone say, food poisoning? I think Applebee's is generally overpriced and has only mediocre food. The salads used to be my favorite thing to order, but now that I got sick from one of them, I won't be going back!!
