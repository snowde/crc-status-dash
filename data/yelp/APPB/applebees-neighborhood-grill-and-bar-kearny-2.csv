Aspiring M.,"North Broadway, NJ",3,37,31,5.0,7/22/2017,"For one I love this applebees . The location, the staff and the food is great . I've never had a problem when eating at this applebees . The bartenders are always fast with service as well and cheerful .  People complain about how long their food takes to come , if you want faster service come at an appropriate time or sit at the bar where staff is always at your service or how about applebees menu barely changes know what you want when you enter that way you can order your food and drinks simultaneously.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kearny-2

This is what is immediately told to me after waiting for service. It's a drink,not a well done steak. ??? Number 1...I asked about your happy hour not your opinion on how many drinks i can take in a 15 minute period. Number 2 I'm a grown man old enough to be your father and can determine how many drinks I can have or decide to order in 15 minutes.

Ok, I came here on a Friday night and it was busy but not crowded.  My family and I quickly got seated.  Five minutes waiting and wondering if anyone is going to ask if we'd like anything to drink, our server, Perry, shows up.  We decided to give him our full order.   When the food came, my order of bourbon chicken and shrimp came out to be riblets and fries.  I just couldn't believe it!  Few minutes later, they brought out the correct dish.   The food was mediocre just like any other diner restaurant but I didn't expect anything more.  However, the service was slow.  I paid the bill on my credit card, which Perry took and walked around with it for another five minutes before he brought it back with my receipt to sign.  Well, I'll be checking my credit card statements and if there's theft charges, I know who stole it!   Must avoid all Applebee's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kearny-2

Overall the staff IMO always greet you as they should and the restaurant has a good atmosphere and is clean and well kept. The appetizers are really good. I like the idea that you can buy 2 smaller appetizers for $9.99 or 3 smaller appetizers for $13.99. My GF always orders Shrimp 'N Parmesan Sirloin and she loves it.

Yan M.,"Jersey City, NJ",405,237,456,3.0,7/12/2015,"Most convenient restaurant to where I was. After I sat down and checked into Yelp. I saw all the negative reviews about the service and long waits at this location. I would give service for my visit a 4 out of 5 since our waiter was very attentive and brought everything we asked immediately. I didn't feel like my meal was worth what I paid. I ordered the pepper crusted sirloin with whole grains. The picture in the menu made it look so amazing and delicious my mouth watered. Upon receiving my meal, I was completely let down. The plate was messy. The sirloin steak was so small i ate it in 5 bites and it was over salted. There wasn't much grains on my plate either. I usually leave a restaurant with leftovers but I finished my meal and was still hungry. Maybe cuz this is considered a healthy dish and they wanna keep it under 550 calories but it was not a normal person portion. My husband ordered the brew pub philly with a side of sweet potato fries and mayo on the side. They put his side of mayo on my plate so we were confused if it was a sauce for my meal for if it was his mayo. They brought him another side of mayo and the mayos did not have the same consistency. We concluded that one of them was actually ranch dressing. Not sure what it was for since neither of us had a salad or anything where we needed ranch.

I informed an employee and she (very kindly) let the hostess know and we were told we could move down a table, which we did, only to discover another dirty table, so we moved down one more. This table was clean on top and underneath, but just a little sticky.  Our waiter Tony came by, and was very nice, and took our drink orders. Then he came back and took our food orders. Good customer service from Tony throughout the meal. The manager, Marco, came by at one point and asked how everything was. We said ""fine"" but didn't tell him about the previous table situation. I don't know why, he seemed nice, but in the moment you hate to make a fuss.  Regarding our food, it was great. We ordered the 4 Cheese Mac & Cheese, the All American Burger, and two kids meals.

We get the manager to complain hoping to get a plate with the appropriate proportion and he offers ""extra chicken"" as if we were just greedy guests. The customer service sucks. The hosts were chatting while there was a whole line of at least 4 couples waiting to check in for a table. Won't ever be coming here. I am definitely sticking to my normal location in Clifton, NJ.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kearny-2?start=40
Kizzie H.,"City of Orange, NJ",0,1,,1.0,12/2/2016,"HORRIBLE experience! My sister and I went in and sat down in a booth. I arrived first, and the waiter approached me in a timely manner. We asked about the happy hour specials and he gave them to us, then asking if we were ready to order. I ordered a Peach Sangria and my sister said she would stick to water. He walked away to put the drink order in. After a minute or so, we noticed the sign that is on every table claiming to give you an appetizer if none of the specified drinks were offered, which they weren't. So we asked the waiter about it and he basically said we weren't getting an appetizer because he has until the end of the bill to offer a drink. So my sister asked for a manager because she didn't quite understand. The manager comes over with an appetizer card and says ""listen I'll give you the appetizer card but I can't sit here and talk to you"". EXTREMELY RUDE! As a manager, it's your job to resolve the problems of your guests. At that point, my sister and I got up and left. We will not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kearny-2?start=40
Jaymie I.,"Fairfield, NJ",8,3,1,1.0,1/30/2015,"Food was horrible.  Me and my gf went tonight and the food was not good even for Applebee's standards.   I got the cross-cut ribs and they came with french fries that were extremely salty and the kitchen forgot to send out my cole slaw. My gf got the pepper crusted steak over spinach grape tomatoes and whole grains. The steak would've been mistaken or just plain bland steak the spinach and the whole grains were over cooked. The only bright spot of our visit was our server Barbara. She was nice polite and very kind,  she was such a delite her tip was over 20%.  If we go back to this Applebee's it would only be to be served by Barbara.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kearny-2?start=40

Susan M.,"Lodi, NJ",0,1,,1.0,10/6/2016,absolutely terrible.. my friend and I came in for a quick appetizer and it was more like almost a 40 minute wait and at last we cancelled one of our appetizers because we did not want to wait any longer. this place should work on speeding up a little. our food was cold by the time it came to the table. it was a total nightmare!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kearny-2?start=40
T'shara B.,"West Orange, NJ",48,10,10,1.0,8/9/2015,Our waitress (Julia) was sweet but the steaks we ordered were extremely salty and when the manager (Ricky) came out to speak to us he said there's nothing he can do because anything else's would be the same and walked off.  He seemed like he didn't have a care in the world.  I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.  Poor customer service by management.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kearny-2?start=40

Lillian H.,"Kearny, NJ",0,1,,1.0,6/15/2016,"Came here with a friend for a late lunch because she was craving chili's molten cake, and this was the closest to Chili's dessert.. Never again!!!! We ordered an appetizer, 2 strawberry lemonades and 2 Three cheese pastas. I took ONE bite of my pasta and spit it out so fast! My stomach felt uneasy and was disgusted that I found a longgggggg strand of hair in my pasta. I called the waitress over , she appologized and offered me somthing else from the menu but who would want to eat there after finding something like that with an unsettling stomach? Not me. The manager didn't even come to our table to appologize personally? Like.. Really? It was not even busy for them to use it as an excuse. We came here for the molten cake and we didn't even make it through lunch, let alone ordering dessert. Lesson of the day: Don't cut corners!!! We should have gone to Chili's!!!!!!!!!! Do yourself a favor and skip this establishment, you could end up sick.

Crystine W.,"New York, NY",752,1201,281,4.0,3/11/2011,"Gotta love your neighborhood Applebee's when it's past 10 and you're hungry, but low on cash.   I really enjoy their post-10 PM specials since the appetizers are half-priced.  Favorites are: - Spinach & Artichoke Dip - Buffalo Wings - Chicken quesadilla - Chili con queso I also like their $20 special: 1 appetizer & 2 entrees.  It's a limited menu, but that deal is REALLY good, where are you going to get so much food for so little??? Service is usually quick, but not necessarily the friendliest.  I've totally outgrown their birthday song & free dessert to celebrate so I only come here now for the past-10 PM deals :).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kearny-2?start=40

Good luck trying to get through on the phone. 20 minutes and counting...that's after being hung up on twice with no answer.  I wish the owner knew what was going on here!  It's absolutely pathetic!  I would give this place ZERO stars if I could!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kearny-2?start=40
