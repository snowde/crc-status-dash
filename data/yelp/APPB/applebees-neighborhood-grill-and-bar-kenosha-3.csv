DeAnna R.,"Honolulu, HI",2,20,7,1.0,9/13/2017,"Came in and signed up for their promotional offer of a free appetizer. When I asked how to redeem it because I did not receive anything after signing up the server said ""I don't know. It's new I'll have to ask my manager."" I said ""ok. Great"" she comes back and says ""he said he doesn't know either. He would have to call corporate to figure it out."" I said ""ok. Will he honor the appetizer?"" And she again said ""I don't know. I'll have to go check"" comes back and says ""I'll send him over. But he said he would have to call IT to figure out what the promotion is offering."" Loan behold the manger never came over. And why would a manager need to call an IT department to ask about a free appetizer. ‍ meanwhile... a few tables down a server is arguing with a guest...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kenosha-3
Rob S.,"Kenosha, WI",0,34,,1.0,11/27/2017,"Just awful.  The only thing that was acceptable was the service.  Daughter wanted to go here because of one specific salad they have, which only proves to me that I should never listen to anything my children say.  Flour tortillas were crunchy around the edges and obviously stale.   Shrimp were precooked and tasted like a handful of salt.  Actually everything tasted like salt  except for the chips served with the salsa.  I don't know what those tasted like because I didn't get any due to the fact that the ""order"" was comprised of about 7 chips.   Unless you enjoy eating terrible food in dingy surroundings or you're a cow or deer whose salt lick has recently gone missing, stay away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kenosha-3

Server was new, sweet girl but unsure about a lot.  I don't blame her as much as I blame management.  I also work in the food service industry.  You can not have your servers hang out in the kitchen, not checking on their tables, nor ""carry on"" laugh and such while in the back.  Come on now!  I appreciate the bartender getting my drink and then stopping by some of the tables to check on them.  I'm not pleased at all and won't be back Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kenosha-3

Jo S.,"Kenosha, WI",13,20,21,2.0,1/21/2017,"We wanted lunch today and thought salads at Applebees would be nice.  My husband ordered the Southwest Steak Salad which looked amazing in the menu.  The salad which was delivered however, was far from the salad pictured on the menu.  As a chef and General Manager of a large food service operation, I can tell you that the steak which was delivered on that plate was barely 3 oz.  I asked the server how many ounces the steak was supposed to be and she said it was 6 oz.  I understand that the servings are actually weighed before cooking, but I do not understand how a 6 oz. steak can lose 3 oz. in the cooking process.  I took a picture of the salad, coincidentally with the fork next to the steak, surprisingly the steak was actually smaller than the tines of the fork.  Very disappointed that we paid $11 for a salad that not only was not the same salad shown on the menu, but that your kitchen thinks that guests are dumb enough to accept the line that the steak is a 6 oz. steak.   I ordered the salad wedge, it was a nice sized portion, but there was so much dressing on the the plate and lettuce it was almost overwhelming.   Also, although I understand the restaurant is for families, its very frustrating when there is a guest who does not have the courtesy to control their children.  The entire time we were in the restaurant, we had to listen to a very loud child who screamed and ran all over the entire restaurant the entire time they were in the establishment.  I also understand it's a very difficult situation with guests like this, but I see nothing wrong with management explaining that it's important for the child's and employees safety that they control where the child is.  I'm sure if this kid fell down the small stairs located by the bar area and hurt themselves it would have opened up the opportunity for the errant mother to file a lawsuit against Applebees, even though she couldn't and didn't control this poorly behaved child.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kenosha-3

Shalina R.,"Kenosha, WI",17,2,,1.0,9/11/2017,"We just experienced the worst customer service in all of my dining history. They were out of certain sizes of steaks so I couldn't order the steak and whole grain meal I wanted, took 20+ minutes to get a drink (a horribly made excuse for a margarita), never did get my soup, or the mexiranch we asked for. And the kids were still hungry after eating their meals so we ordered more food for them... Which we never did get. My husband got the chicken fajita rollup which was good and I got the Wonton stir-fry which was a small portion lacking flavor and sauce. The staff was literally standing around chatting including the manager instead of working. I finally got up and asked for the bill or said I was going to leave. The manager said we didn't have to pay anything. He clearly didn't care about the lack of service or success of the restaurant .... We heard him taking things off of people's bills all night. I'll be very surprised if that restaurant lasts much longer with all the competition in town. I've been noticing smaller portions over time and now horrible service. Other local restaurants offer all you can eat fries, kids Mac and cheese, home cooked food, quicker service, etc. Better up your game or your doors will be closing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kenosha-3

K W.,"Kenosha, WI",13,7,,1.0,12/26/2016,"Almost every review on here is about how bad and slow the service is. I'll admit that until tonight I would not have agreed with that. In fact, we ate here a month ago for my husband's birthday and the food was fantastic. I wouldn't say the service was 'fast' that night, but it was definitely about average; not slow. Tonight...our service was so slow....it actually didn't even exist. We were seated and told our server would be right with us. Ok. We took about 10 minutes to look over the menu....still no server. We waited another 5 minutes, no server. So I put in our appetizer order using the little touchpad devices at the table. Our appetizer actually came out pretty quickly - about 5 minutes after placing the order. I told the person who brought us our appetizer that we hadn't spoken to a server yet and asked if he could take our drink order.  Our drinks took another 5 minutes or so to come out and it was someone else who brought them. He asked if our server had been to our table yet and we said no. He asked if we had spoken to a manager and I indicated that we had only talked to the the person who brought our appetizer. Based on the color of his shirt we determined that was the manager. This particular person said he would find out where our server was/what was going on and if our server was unavailable he'd be happy to help us. He asked if we needed anything else and I stupidly said no - we should have just ordered our entrees then, but I assumed our regular server would be with us shortly. Nope. We ate our appetizer (slowly) and still no server. The manager never came back to check on us. The other server who brought our drinks never came back to check on us.  I paid for the appetizer on the touchpad device (and hey, free drinks! because no one had added them to our bill yet because we HAD NO SERVER....) and we left. F'ing horrible. I'll still eat at Applebee's, but I don't want to ever go back to THIS Applebee's location....unless they fire the management and servers and hire a completely new staff who know what the heck they are doing....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kenosha-3

As soon as you walk into the restaurant it smells like dirty mop water, you can see dust all over the decor and railings. The ceiling was leaking and dripping on our waitress head and nothing was done about it the entire hour we were there. Just imagine if the manager allows the dinning room to look and smell like a dirty mop bucket, what does the kitchen look like where they prepare the food we eat. The table we sat at I had direct sight to the kitchen door and saw numerous kitchen staff come in and out going to the restroom .

You can see it leaks in several different places. Also it's very cold. No matter what it's like outside it's always cold in the restaurant. There are plenty of televisions so I suppose that's a plus, booths are nice and so are the tables, the waiters and waitresses look presentable and are very nice, the food is also always pretty good so those are a few pluses but as I've said, nasty dripping ceiling, kind of distrusting considering people eat here.

Jack G.,"Trevor, WI",33,22,,2.0,3/13/2014,"We used to get take out from here about once a month when we lived in Pleasant Prairie, then it seemed like they screwed up our order at least every other time. Fast forward about 5 years, we had gone a few times since and usually left highly disappointed in either the food or service each time.  My brother in law mentioned Applebees and we were in Kenosha getting some other stuff done so we decided to get it the annual shot. The service was pretty good and that's about where the good ends.  The salad was smaller and wasn't near what it used to be as far as effort of putting more than just lettuce on it (they at least used to get that right). This time about half of the lettuce was either brown or had like that moldy look to it. Then our wraps were served (both missing the sauce), after a bite we had to wait for the sauce as both were so bone dry and just lacking flavor, we were quickly reminded of why we no longer have a desire to go to this place.  It would be one star if at least the waitress hasn't refilled my iced tea when it was 3/4 empty a few times. She notcied we were less than thrilled with the food, but wasn't much she could do you could tell.  This time we won't be returning again this one was like 15 strikes and it's finally out.

The price wasn't very cheap though. My friend ordered the Appetizer Sampler. along with our drinks and without the tip, our order came out to be about $30 bucks.

J S.,"Kenosha, WI",0,4,,3.0,3/13/2015,"Went here for lunch, service good, food good.  I am doing a low carb diet so I ordered the Parmesan steak and shrimp.  I told the waitress I did not want fries, baked potato, or veggies (don't like veggies) so could I please have a side salad.  She went back to check....Nope, $3.00 more to do that.  So you would rather give me potatoes and veggies over a salad that probably costs you about .25 cents.  The meal already cost 16.99 and a drink.  No wonder our country is overweight when it costs you more for trying to be healthy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kenosha-3?start=20
Denise G.,"Union Grove, WI",0,16,7,1.0,11/3/2013,This Applebee's has gone downhill   The service is TERRIBLE. There are servers all over but they are basically standing around. When I asked to have a server come to get our order she was short with us and didnt apologize for making us wait for 10 minutes before anyone came. Not planning on coming again,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kenosha-3?start=40

Elan J.,"Kenosha, WI",11,89,24,1.0,3/28/2015,"Should be ZERO stars!!! First, I got a pager and it took us 45 minutes to be seated. Okay, figure its Friday and they are busy. My party arrived even before we were seated, everyone even the late arrivals. They had 15 people waiting for tables, while the staff hung around up front socializing. We also noticed several open and clean tables that were unused, just sitting there!!! My party waited 20 minutes for drinks and another 30 for appetizers. Ridiculous. I was the only one that ordered food. The fish fry I ordered was burnt and greasy with no flavor. There were patches of breading missing, like they were in a hurry. The fries were bland and dry. The ""coleslaw"" had no dressing, curious. Oh yeah, was that tarter sauce? It was cheap dill ranch dressing!!! I paid for my portion of the bill which came to twenty dollars, ugh. Upon leaving they would not give my friend a to go container for her half price appetizer...REALLY!!!  But the worst was yet to come an hour later when I didn't feel so good...food poisoning!!!  NOT HAPPY!!! DO NOT GO HERE!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kenosha-3?start=40
Travis B.,"Pleasant Prairie, WI",0,5,,1.0,5/25/2015,"Let me preface this by writing that I don't go to Applebee's because well...it's Applebee's. But I went this time because my wife had a $25 gift certificate.  We decided to get our food to go and eat at home. Our first sign that this place sucks was an almost empty parking lot.( this was a holiday and every other restaurant that we drove by was full of cars). We arrived in the bar to pick up our food. We gave our name to the bartender, she handed us a Togo bag of food and rang up our bill.  We arrived home about 10 minutes away and opened our containers to find out they messed up our order.( not even close). We called up on the way back to return the food. The gentleman was very apologetic and stated that the manager would speak to us and probably take something off our bill.   When we arrived back at Applebee's ,we returned the food to the bartender who was expecting us. The bartender stated she needed to speak to the manager. The manager was sitting at a table in the bar about 10 feet from my wife and I. She didn't even have the courtesy to come over to us and apologize(didn't even turn in our direction for that matter).  I will never set foot in this place again. Now you know why the parking lot is empty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kenosha-3?start=40
tony e.,"Waukegan, IL",0,2,2,1.0,3/31/2015,"This was the far worse experience I have experience I have had at any restaurant ever. First of all the little girl at the door did not want to seat us, she told me it was going to be a 20 minute wait and there where tables and 3 booths available and only one other person waiting ahead of us. I asked why we couldn't seat at one of the open booths and she had got a nasty attitude and said follow her to one of the open booths. After being seated from her being so rude, I noticed her telling one of the waitresses about me asking about the open booths. After that we waited 15 mins. for anybody even came over and asked if we wanted something to drink and it was the manager and she apologize and said it was some waitress first night. (Which that one never came tell after we got our food!) Once we placed our order we waited an hour to even receive our food and 3 other families that came in after us received their food way before we did and when we did get it my steak was super dry and the mash potatoes was cold. Now people this wasn't the worst part of it, the worst is that they had to put something in my food cause I came home and was on the toilet for 20 mins. which is cool for me cause I needed a colon cleansing, but I won't be back no time soon and maybe when we do go back the staff will have changed again. They have a huge turnover rate! Not a good sign at all! What a birthday treat I received from them!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kenosha-3?start=40
Holly S.,"Kenosha, WI",42,32,4,3.0,2/25/2012,"Had late night half price appetizers, mozzarella sticks and queso dip were both good, but my margarita left much to be desired-  it was on special, so i should have guessed.  The bartender was personable, and the crowd was quiet, good place to sober up with fried food after a few drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kenosha-3?start=40
J B.,"Racine, WI",3,94,1,2.0,6/25/2010,"So I am the first to review this place?  That's odd, since it's been at this location awhile and business seems pretty steady.  Well, this is not my kind of place, folks.  I usually dislike chain restaurants and Applebee's is the prime example why.  Does it get more bland, from the decor to the menu choices to the lackluster service?!  I ate there last night with Pinch and GG, cuz the latter likes it.  Chili's across the street, which I think is better, is too spicy for her.  I ordered the Fiesta Lime Chicken.  The only lime element in this meal was a small, dry/shriveled wedge on the side of the plate for garnish.  So a modest sized chicken breast covered with cheese, along with dubious tortilla strips and lackluster ""spanish rice"" goes for $10?  No wonder they're makin' money in this economy.  My advice for better dining in Kenosha is to head towards the lake.  There you'll find Twisted Cuisine and other more distinctive dining choices that are actually worth a try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kenosha-3?start=40
