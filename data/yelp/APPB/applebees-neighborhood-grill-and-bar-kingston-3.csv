Kevin C.,"Kingston, NY",1,9,,2.0,4/25/2010,"Food is not the greatest but it does have some good drinks. The always have the 2 for 1 draft mugs which come ice cold. The only problem to that is they give you the 2 mugs at once and not when you finish the first, so then you rush to finish your beer before the other gets warm. They also have a problem with child seats. The straps are always broken and when you tell them they say the won't give it out to anyone anymore but you get it again the next time you come.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kingston-3?start=20
Skip S.,"Saugerties, NY",32,16,3,4.0,8/20/2017,I never thought I would ever say much about this place (because its commercial) BUT.......I am a wing connoisseur. Who would have thought a chain restaurant could bring a double crunch bone in wing. Spicy sweet Asian Chile. OMG!! So good. Staff so great!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kingston-3
Barbara R.,"Rhinebeck, NY",0,19,,1.0,6/22/2017,"Almost all my reviews have been positive....this may be my first one star review. My sister and brother in law were in town.  We went to another (fancier) restaurant the evening they arrived but the next day they were to leave Kingston and just wanted a fast food, decent food, restaurant so we could spend a bit more time together.  It was on a Wednesday afternoon and not very crowded. It took forever for the waiter to come over.  Then he plops down three small plates with three servings of silverware.  We are four people!  He comes back to take the drink order and then gets lost...eventually comes back with a another setting. We said we want to order now.   It took one hours and five minutes to get our food.  My friend only wanted a burger and fries with lettuce and tomato ... it came without the tomato and lettuce.  I had to search for him.  My sister's oriental salad was missing the noodles.  I ordered the small steak with 1/2 rack ribs.  The ribs were so overdone, you couldn't eat the burnt parts and yes I asked for medium well on the steak...it was charcoal.  Sorry but we will never go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kingston-3
Neal E.,"Haymarket, VA",1169,4360,28768,3.0,12/3/2014,"I stopped in for some adult beverages on a Friday evening. I sat at the bar and ordered a Bloody Mary. Much like my experience at the local Courtyard - the Bloody Mary was served in a smaller glass (Bloody Mary's should be served in a tall highball glass or pint glass). I guess the idea is to skimp on amount of ingredients with a smaller glass, while still charging a premium price for the drink. I realized that after that Bloody Mary I was going to need to drink a whole of of them to even get a little buzz, so I switched to a vodka martini. I asked to see the glass size before ordering. Finally! A normal sized glass. I ordered it slightly dirty with three olives. I asked if they had Blue Cheese stuffed olives. Being Applebee's, it was a ridiculous request on my part, they had no such option. Overall, the martini was strong and well made. I would have stayed longer, but being it was Friday night, there was a Karaoke session ongoing, and it was LOUD and annoying. Service was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kingston-3
Robert H.,"Levittown, NY",0,24,,1.0,8/7/2017,"This restaurant was terrible. Despite calling ahead and mentioning it when we entered the restaurant that we were here for the half price appetizers, the restaurant did not tell us until the check came that only three of the total number of appetizers was half price. We spoke to both the waiter and the manager and they refused to do anything, to even take a few dollars off of the bill. The waiter was slow, disorganized, and failed to bring us the correct food in any type of semblance of order. This is a restaurant that you should avoid unless you have no other eating options in the city of Kingston. Their customer service is abysmal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kingston-3
Ellen S.,"Kingston, NY",0,18,4,1.0,12/23/2016,Somebody in my family is a vegetarian and had nothing to choose from. Don;t go there if you're a vegetarian.  Only option is to get a salad without the meat and pay the same price.  How hard is it to have some veggie burgers on hand and substitute them.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kingston-3
John B.,"Hurley, NY",74,119,,1.0,9/2/2016,"Food is fine.  But the management keeps the place so cold it's like eating in a walk-in refrigerator.  I presume this is by design to ensure high turnover.  We asked two different servers (very politely) to turn down the air.  Their response was exactly the same.  ""I'll try but the management never lets us.""   Both my kids were shivering.  Most patrons were visibly uncomfortable.  I know I was.   We won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kingston-3
Amanda M.,"Long Island, NY",383,796,567,3.0,6/24/2012,"I'm never impressed with Applebee's, so I don't know why I keep trying it. I got that new turkey club with pesto, fried green tomatoes, and bacon, but i took the bacon off. Was salty, but okay. My boyfriend wasn't happy with the service at all, mainly because she was ""shooting the shit"" with all the other waitresses, in my boyfriends words. The calorie intake on their menu made me not want to eat anything.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kingston-3
Ilana G.,"Bronx, NY",0,5,5,1.0,5/17/2015,SO RUDE. we went in on a saturday night for a few drinks and an appetizer. We walked into a worker cleaning we then waited over 5 minutes for a hostess. Noone ever came so we decided too just take a seat and got yelled at by what im assuming was a server behind a wall telling we couldnt just sit ourselves he then disappeared again. So we just walked out. Horrible service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kingston-3
Gregory J.,"Edison, NJ",9,8,,3.0,9/2/2013,"Standard fare, nothing great or horrible to remark about. They did have a leaky ceiling though. Service was good, as it always is at an Applebee's. though, more than others, this one felt very local. It had prom pictures up instead of the generic posters and signs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kingston-3
Maureen N.,"Wappingers Falls, NY",1,18,,1.0,5/14/2015,"Hubby,son, 2 grandsons (3 1/2 & 5 1/2 years old ) & self went for lunch after the train show. Seated immediately, checked out the menu and ordered AND WAITED, AND WAITED. Children were hungry and getting impatient after waiting so long about 40 minutes. FINALLY, food comes and child's meal of 1 hot dog comes out on this huge rectangular HOT dish with a rattan tablemat under it. The mat was soiled with ketshup. I grab the hot dog with a napkin and told the waitress to take the dish and mat away. Also served was carrots with ranch for the children's menu. Carrots were dried out and room temp. Son's chicken nuggets with bleu cheese and celery. Celery was dried out and warm. YUK! My sandwich had minimal chicken on it and the side salad, well, it was from the same category of the carrots and celery.  Not going again for sure!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kingston-3
Nat W.,"Kapolei, HI",241,1884,1405,2.0,8/30/2009,"They simply just do not have tasty food at all...Comparing with other franchised restaurants like Chili's, TGI Friday etc...in the area, Applebees is the worst ever.  And I have to say of all the Applebee's locations, this could be one of the worst too.    I have tried three cheese chicken penne, orange chicken bowl, another pasta (forgot what it was) and some dessert....I found none of them were good.  The only thing was good at the restaurant was Shrimp Spinach Salad.   Just avoid applebees if you can.  I have been there 5 times but none of the times I went there was my choice obviously.  There are better restaurants in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kingston-3
Jerry D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,35,,1.0,10/8/2013,"A friend took me to one of these corporate crap-holes near a mall after we saw ""Gravity"".  ""They serve drinks and sandwiches, and they're fast,"" she said. If my frozen margarita had a drop of alcohol in it, I'll be a monkey's uncle. I had some sort of a 1500-calories combo sandwich with ham, turkey, bacon, gooey sauce, and lettuce, and the heartburn that kept me up all night was unrelenting. I wonder if Applebees' CEO ever eats at one of his own establishments.  Methinks not... What a total waste of $40 on lunch for two.  Bleaaahhh...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kingston-3
Rudik U.,"Pine Plains, NY",11,109,,3.0,4/16/2015,Decent food with good service. My only complaint is why would the old Manager asked us how is everything just when we were getting up to leave? Now isn't that a question one should ask before you get up and leave? Like before the check comes?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kingston-3
Barbara S.,"Saugerties, NY",0,3,11,1.0,2/15/2015,"My husband & went there this was maybe our 2nd time at this location.  We got seated placed our order I had Cesar salad which when I was almost finished with my salad there was a short hair on my plate . My husband is bald & my hair is long .   Waiters took plate $ said oh.  Should have left didn't my husband insisted it was mine , NOT.  Well our dinners came and our plates were dirty.   The top had old food & greasy finger prints AND BOTTOM had old food on it . Well we did not eat either plate.  Mgr gave us gift cert to come back & try them again . Waitress said cooks got ass handed to them .  So 2 days later went back with gift cert. hostess seated us I HAD TO WIPE MY BOTH seat off there was food on seat.  In our isle there was food straw paper ect on floor it was atrocious. Who Evers job it is to clean floors dropped ball.  Whole time during dinner white straw paper next to PC of food was next to me through whole dinning experience.  Bathrooms had urine on men's floor , poop on women's walls .

Bill K.,"Charter Township of Clinton, MI",52,47,6,3.0,8/22/2011,"I have not been to this Applebee's in over a year, because frankly the last time I was here, it sucked, and I might have given it two stars only because the waitress was hot. This time, however, it is much improved.  I ordered the trio appetizer for lunch, since I can try different things, and it is a full lunch for one person.  I got the boneless buffalo wings, the cheeseburger sliders, and the steak quesadilla tower.  The wings were nicely crispy, and the sauce has a slow burn to it.  The sliders were hot, the buns are cooked onsite, and nicely fresh.  I would have liked either some tomato or onion slices instead of the finely diced onion that was on them.  The steak tower quesadilla is just a steak wrap with some cheese and seasonings, then cut in half and stood on end.  Cheese was gooey, the steak was fairly tender, and the wrap was soft. Overall, the only reason I didn't give 4 stars was because the last visit rated 2 stars for the hot waitress, and they need another good experience for me before I bump them above three stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kingston-3
Marian E.,"Lake Katrine, NY",0,20,,1.0,1/1/2015,"Well, I called tonight for a takeout order. After having been put on hold for a couple of minutes a woman took my order of burgers and boneless wings with a very nasty attitude and told me it would be a wait of 15 to 20 minutes. When I got to the restaurant 10 minutes later I sat down and, when asked by the bartender, told him about my order. After a thirty-minute-wait I asked about my order and he went to check on it, just to come back and tell me that they ""just ran out of boneless wings"". (At this point my order already had been placed 40 minutes ago. I should have been notified about that when I got to the place and told the bartender about my pick up order. Not after having waited for 30 (40) minutes. Or they just didn't even start making my order until 40 minutes after placing it. Either way, this was no good service at all! I have been taste wise disappointed by Applebee's before. After this, I will probably not come back at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kingston-3
Mike M.,"Fishkill, NY",36,174,1,4.0,11/7/2011,"Applebee's is one of my favorite chain places. They're consistant, have tasty food, friendly service, and super cheap prices. The Kingston Applebee's in particular is one of the better ones. I go to it often when I'm in the area. I've always had nice, quick service, yummy food, and a pleasant dining experience.

Chris B.,"Red Hook, NY",7,825,459,3.0,11/27/2011,"Polite staff work here.  Food was okay.  The day I ate here last, I had a loose tooth problem.  We requested my meal be super-soft, and that's exactly how we found it.  Although my parents found a problem in this company, i did find them to be a little on the spicy side, and a little on the expensive side, so eat here in moderation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kingston-3
Arick D.,"Saugerties, NY",0,3,1,1.0,6/5/2013,"If I could give them a -1 i would, we sat at the bar w my best friend although I don't have high expectations, at a chain restaurant I do expect some sort of good customer service, after ordering buffalo wings that took forever even thought the place wasn't busy, they didn't give me any silverware or napkins, she was quick to bring the bill after bringing the food out so I used my check to wipe my hands off. This is my 3rd time their. The only time I have good service is when I had sit at the bar, and a girl name Amanda serves us.

Andrew G.,"Port Ewen, NY",13,82,53,3.0,4/22/2010,"Not a bad place, but I'll tell you, if it's more than a 5 minute wait to get a seat, then it's not worth the wait. The mud slides they have here are pretty good. Food, on the other hand, always makes me want to drink water constantly. The tomato basil soup is the best thing they have here. Unfortunately, on several occasions, they've been fresh out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kingston-3
