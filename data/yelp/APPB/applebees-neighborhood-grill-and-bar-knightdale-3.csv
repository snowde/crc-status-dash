David S.,"Raleigh, NC",2,120,89,5.0,1/8/2018,"Applebee's never fails to save the day. We had a party of 6 walk in Sunday night to do the promotion on the endless riblets and tenders. We were seated decently quickly as the place was packed and Jess efficiently took our order. She shortly after got out drinks to the table and took our orders. Food came out well, the endless chicken and riblets were amazing although I was unable to sample the $2 beer, I did order a drink which I though to be a bit expensive at $10. Overall, a great experience",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knightdale-3
Glennda M.,"Zebulon, NC",0,20,22,2.0,1/7/2018,"We visited here with a group of 6 on Saturday night. We were able to make a reservation so we didn't have to wait too long to be seated. Unfortunately, that was the end of the good service. The food took so long to be served, and it was cold by the time it arrived. The wait staff ignored us most of the meal. Overall, the food was not really worth the wait. I believe part of the problem is that there are very few chain restaurants in the area to choose from so consumers have a choice...substandard service and mediocre food or drive to the city!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knightdale-3
Meaghan G.,"Raleigh, NC",189,38,2,4.0,4/14/2017,"food was delicious. the only thing that bugged me is that we asked for a booth, and we're seated at a table. When I asked why we couldn't sit at the booth next to our table that was empty, they didn't really have a response.. other than that, good experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knightdale-3
Cindy M.,"Knightdale, NC",0,4,,1.0,6/5/2017,"Been to Knightdale Applebee's twice the last couple weeks and had bad experience both times with very slow to be waited on and had to ask to get my order taken. Then asked for a soft drink and got carbonates water. The waitress said she would be right back and never came so I had o ask another waitress to go get my drink. Then the waitress brought wrong food. Manager then came after I asked to speak to him and he was nice. He said he would watch over all and I could get a complimentary dessert or something. I asked for a take out tray after I was done and never got one or my bill but had to ask for the take out tray again and ask for the bill. When I had yo ask the waitress went to the credit card machine on the table and said I would only be charged for the dessert. So I swiped my card and then the other waitress came up and said no you don't have a charge and all complimentary. So the first waitress that has told me I'd be charged for the dessert reset the machine so I guess the payment didn't go through. The manager came back to tell me there wasn't going to be a charge. I know it took so so much time waiting for all that I had to wait for and I wanted to go on with my night but instead stuck there so long. The food was ok and the dessert good. They have changed management and waitresses since I use to go a lot last year. They have really gone downhill a lot. No one is there  when you come in I need to be seated either and I thought I needed to sit myself those last two times I've built but then finally someone would go get the person or tell them, holler out for them to come. This was one of my favorite places to go but really afraid to go back now with what I had to go through just to get a meal and a drink and get out of there that staying for hours. Said for that Applebee's since it was one of the best places to go in Knightdale!  I will say that they tried to make it up to me by giving me my meal for free and the desert but if I knew it was going to be the way it was a free meal would not have been worth all that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knightdale-3
Charlie F.,"Raleigh, NC",215,981,1222,4.0,7/7/2014,"First visit to the Knightdale location.   Nice decor with lots of Knightdale and ACC related photos. Noticed a small tablet sized device on the end of the table.  Server explained that this is something new that will be fully operational soon.  Apparently you will be able to order adult beverage refills and desserts from the device plus pay your check via credit card or page your server to come to the table.  It also has several games that you could play for a price. I ordered the triple appetizers of boneless chicken, cheeseburger sliders, and mozzarella sticks.  Filling portions and good taste. Server was polite and service was very good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knightdale-3
Betel Y.,"Santa Clara, CA",2,3,,5.0,7/3/2016,"This was my first time going to Applebee's and am glad I went to this one. I was visiting NC and it was my last night so my friends and I decided to check it out. It was late (11pm) so there were only a few people. We were seated and Brandon brought us the menu. Since we've never been to Applebee's, we had some questions and Brandon took his time to explain and recommend their best.  The food came within 15 mins. It was delicious!  Restrooms were decent and clean which I think is very important. The service was the best! Brandon surpassed our expectations!  Over all, it was a great experience and I would recommend anyone to check this Applebee's out. I will definitely come back the next time am in NC.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knightdale-3
Ranjay J.,"Knightdale, NC",43,112,4,3.0,5/25/2016,"It was a lazy Sunday evening and we didn't want to travel far for dinner and so we decided not to be Yelp snobs and stopped by the neigbourhood Applebee's. Our waitress told us that they had just revamped their menu, and now had a wood-fired grill that made all of their meat tastier.  Intrigued, I decided to try their pork chop.  It turned out excellent!  Thick slab of bone-in pork chop, very well seasoned, tender and juicy on the inside.  It came with a really strange apple chutney that I did not like, I should've probably just ordered it plain.  The side of maple pecan sweet potatoes was really good, and garlic green beans were....green beans.  My partner got some fried chicken with brown gravy and that was really good too.  We also tried an appetizer sampler, and their boneless buffalo wings were actually pretty good.  Desserts were a mixed bag. My partner got a blondie with vanilla ice cream that was freshly made in-house and was really good.  I got a banana cheesecake that was absolutely horrible-- it had the consistency of a mousse and had a ton of articificial banana flavoring.   All in all, if you order the right dishes, you can actually have a 4-star quality dinner here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knightdale-3
Lea A.,"Cary, NC",151,248,139,2.0,9/18/2016,"A disaster..It was an early Saturday afternoon.  We decided to meet my mother and an out of town relative for lunch.  First thing we noticed after we were seated was the lack of cool air.  One of the air conditioning units was out.  Come on owner of this Applebees, do you think that's safe?  There are plenty of portable floor ac's at near by stores ready for purchase that work very well for emergencies.  The ladies bathroom had the smell of a sewage back up.. I am getting sick as I type.  As for the food... please stop using iceberg lettuce for the salads..especially steak salads...that's just not cute nor cool anymore.  Everyone else in my party thought that their food was just ok.  We had so many things to discuss amongst ourselves which made up for the lack of decent food.  Our server was very nice..so nothing against her at all.  I'm sure some over-zealous customer would report this location to the health department.  If they did, I promise it wasn't me this time since I know I will not be returning, so I'm not that pressed...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knightdale-3
Luis S.,"Atlanta, GA",4,161,80,4.0,11/6/2015,"Well again I gave it 4 for the excellent job done by the waiters Taylor blees her soul and the bartender did and excellent job with thw drinks. Now the sad part, the food well I order the Brunch Burger it was good but they overcooked the damn patty and the egg @_@!!! Good thing fries where really good!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knightdale-3
Sara T.,"Knightdale, NC",97,24,3,4.0,2/7/2016,Stopped in for car to go service.  Person on phone not helpful and said they don't do car to go service until 5pm.  This is not true. I had to go in.  Manager Mark was excellent and took care of me and very nice. Situation resolved. Comped my order also.  Love Applebees in Knightdale.  Awesome.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knightdale-3
Paula E.,"Phoenix, AZ",222,598,1189,2.0,3/7/2013,"Usually we can count on good food and great service. However we didn't really have that at this location.  It was a NC state game night when we attended (which was a big turn off on our part) as the TVs were blaring loudly. The servers seemed more interested in watching the game then serving customers. We even noted the manager didn't' come by to check how things were with us since he was glued to the TV as well. Food took 20 minutes to arrive at our table, and I am guessing perhaps the cooks were watching the game too? Food basically looked thrown on the plate and steaks were both tough and tasteless. Since we had plans for the evening we quickly consumed our undesirable meals and headed out.  I usually eat at the one at Triangle town center which I have never had a problem at. Probably will not go to this one again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knightdale-3
Michelle R.,"Raleigh, NC",0,25,11,2.0,1/8/2016,We were there for Sunday lunch. Not busy at all but somehow a lot of tables were dirty including the one we were sat at. Food okay.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knightdale-3
Bridgette W.,"Durham, NC",1,2,1,1.0,3/7/2015,"My family and I chose to hold our monthly family gathering at this establishment. A few of us arrived about 4:45pm tonight to make sure they would be able to accommodate such a large group. We were informed by the  manager who was wearing a very dirty yellow managers shirt. That our party could be seated around 6 or 6:30.  Mind you the place had one large group that was sitting in one area. That group had payed the check just sitting. Was told by the server check was paid 30 min earlier. Then a few tables had 2-4 people not really busy. Reservations are not allowed!!! Will never go back, the manager allowed a $400.00 food check and a $100.00 plus tip to walk out the front door.  We walked across the parking lot and went to Chiles.. Had a great time!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knightdale-3
Robert M.,"Cary, NC",25,20,9,3.0,1/20/2015,"Dinner tonight was nice even though we had to send a meal back. The mac and cheese with chicken tenders tasted very strongly of onions which we had been assured when it was ordered that there were no onions whatsoever.  We were able to switch to a fish and chips which was fine. The one thing that left me with a sour taste in my mouth was when we went to leave, before we could even get out of the booth a girl came up with a rag in hand and basically forced us to hurry to get our coats on, even handing one other in our party her purse. I felt that this was extremely rude and considering it was a slow tuesday night with no wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knightdale-3
Savannah B.,"Charlotte, NC",0,2,1,1.0,8/27/2016,So our experience here started off great. Up until the point that our medium rare steak came out more medium well and was extremely tough. We sent it back and the waiting game began. After 15 minutes the manager brought our steak out to the wrong table and then tried to figure out where the rest of that tables food was. He went back to the kitchen and right back out with the rest of their food. We were still waiting even though we were seated way before this other table. The manager visited them several times to make sure everything was ok. Still no steak or manager visit for us. After about 10 more minutes the steak finally came out and we asked for the check. We were still charged for the steak and had to walk up to the manager to ask why he cared so much about the other table and not us. We then asked for the steak to be removed from our bill. Still no apology. The service was good but the management was horrible. Marcus might want to work on his customer service skills a bit.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knightdale-3
Tierea H.,"Raleigh, NC",3,15,90,3.0,3/14/2014,"Our service was really good, however the food isn't what it should've been. The bourbon chicken and shrimp was ok but the potato wedges were overcooked. I had another chicken meal and the chicken was also dry. The trio sampler was really good and the frozen strawberry lemonade was to die for. The French onion soup was ok, not something I would go out my way to have again. I'd rather go to other Applebee's locations cuz this one was not the best",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knightdale-3
Ishopalot F.,"Knightdale, NC",0,13,13,5.0,5/16/2015,"I took my family out for a late lunch today and it was worth waiting for.

Dave T.,"Raleigh, NC",68,174,582,3.0,8/21/2012,"Decent place to take the family. The staff are very nice and more than happy to serve. The food has been spot-on the past two times we've visited in the past month. The price is a little out of our family budget.  I highly recommend the chicken & shrimp w/ a side of mashed potatoes, awesome the past two times!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knightdale-3
Elana R.,"Brooklyn, NY",24,82,,2.0,6/21/2014,"Their service is GARBAGE on every level. I've been here many times but am finally giving up on them. They skimp on the portions, have very very off-putting phone manner, often bring out incorrect orders, and most dishes are just mediocre. Worst applebees location I've dealt with. Glad there are many other food options nearby.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knightdale-3
Phoenix F.,"Wendell, NC",0,8,,5.0,5/13/2014,"Hubby and I sat at the bar and the bartender was excellent.  She was very polite and kept up with our drinks and food.  The food was great; everything was fresh and cooked perfectly.  The restaurant wasn't busy at all because it was early, so most of the servers were standing around talking...but it didn't seem like people were being ignored.  Based on our experience I think we'd return.  :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knightdale-3

Rachel S.,"Raleigh, NC",0,13,,2.0,8/19/2013,"The service was awful. The restaurant was about half full. My friend and I waited a few minutes to be seated, as the hostess was nowhere to be seen when we walked in. She was very friendly though, once she sat us. We waited 15 minutes at our table, with no waiter helping us. We eventually grabbed the manager as she was walking around and told her. She took our order immediately. She had just had another table complain to her about something, so I felt a little bad. She must be having problems with her staff often. She brought our drinks and food out, and the service was good from then on out. Still, it's not the manager's job to take orders and bring food to tables. I will not be going back, if only to save the manager from added stress.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knightdale-3?start=20
Jeff H.,"Raleigh, NC",9,195,7,3.0,5/22/2008,"This seems like a pretty standard Applebee's. I didn't really like this chain in the past, but they've changed their menu enough that it isn't bad. It's still a big chain, though, so nothing here is local, creative, or artistic. We went to this location on a weeknight, and all of the waitstaff seemed to be in their teens. The service wasn't bad, but it wasn't exactly attentive, either. It took a while for beverages to be refilled and the check to arrive, and the place wasn't overly busy. Not bad in a pinch, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knightdale-3?start=20
