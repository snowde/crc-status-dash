Lee L.,"Orlando, FL",1,401,435,4.0,3/4/2016,Not a fan of Applebee's but It's not my first rodeo either. A partner of my boys wanted to take us to lunch and this ended up being the joint of choice. Wasn't just at all. We came on out to the bar to grub. Started with honey wings then got the 2 for 20. My boy got the bourbon chicken and I got the  steak. Service was good and food was as expected. I'mma hook them up today with a five unless something goes bad.......... Ok it was good. No complaints.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lake-park
Ariel W.,"Pompano Beach, FL",202,217,1598,4.0,1/30/2017,I found myself in the area with time to kill while waiting for my daughter who was attending a nearby concert. I almost never dine alone but when I saw the Applebee's I decided to treat myself to a spur of the moment late night dinner. Upon entering the restaurant looked very clean and was decked out for Valentines Day. Additional decorative touches included the names of local colleges and high schools above the tables running the outer perimeter of the room. For dinner I had the grilled lemon chicken (from the lighter portion of the menu) with a raspberry cosmo. My server was a very nice guy and I was served promptly. Both the drink and food were great.  I don't expect to be back in this area but if I was I wouldn't hesitate to visit again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lake-park
Trina S.,"West Palm Beach, FL",257,109,61,1.0,11/2/2017,"My family and I had the worst experience here. Slow getting our drink, slow service & wrote on our check to suggest their tip. The most unprofessional thing a server can do. Thanks to our service here & corporate treatment I have never eaten at another Applebee's again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lake-park
Anna W.,"West Palm Beach, FL",1,29,43,1.0,4/6/2017,Dirty!!!!!! I seen the waiter look at us and then tell the girl im not taking them. Im watching them the whole time.

D Y.,"Port St. Lucie, FL",0,3,,1.0,10/26/2017,We went here 2 weeks ago and it's closed. The sign directs you to their palm beach location,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lake-park
Chris C.,"Tucson, AZ",0,6,3,1.0,7/9/2016,Terrible service and terrible food. Waitress was slow. Pulled pork sandwich was made twice not to my satisfaction. Chicken Alfredo was dry was well. My beer was not cold. Terrible experience!!!!!!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lake-park
Irene D.,"Cape Coral, FL",6,4,,2.0,8/26/2017,"Not into chains, service usually mediocre, as food is, frozen!! Drinks measured !! Just not a place I like to patronize. At one time we had no choice fortunately we do now. We need to assist in patronize single restaurants versus chains",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lake-park
Gator S.,"Miami Beach, FL",33,26,,2.0,1/23/2016,Why do I come to chain restaurants. ... I use YELP to help me find local owned places with great success.  But here I sit at Apple Bees and the staff is great as it usually is. I order the triple dog dare you not a bad sandwich but my damn fries are cold and stale and they're halfway busy they're not pats and they're not empty how in the hell do you get cold and stale fries oh I know why cuz it's a chain restaurant and they're not worth the time or effort.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lake-park
Jason D.,"Carpinteria, CA",2,6,,4.0,8/28/2016,Had a steak and baked potato with the garlic green beans. Steak was cooked just as I ordered it and was perfectly seasoned. The mushrooms on top not over cooked!  Green beans hot and still a little crispy with just the right amount of garlic. We sat at the bar and the bartender was very friendly very accommodating.  Good job folks,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lake-park
Clint G.,"West Palm Beach, FL",36,23,17,5.0,11/1/2016,Good spot for lunch during the weekday.  Kelsey at the bar is great and her team will keep you entertained.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lake-park
Ed R.,"Philadelphia, PA",20,137,63,5.0,4/10/2015,"It was my first time here. Marcel, the host, was aggressive with hospitality. What I mean by this is he saw us approaching the building and came outside to open the door for us. He continued with a highly customer-service oriented style while taking us to a table. And later he even opened the door for us upon our departure. He set the tone for our experience here. Our server was ""Precious."" Yes, that is her real name. We thought that was interesting. She did fine. I was impressed with the decor. Nice place. The food was fine. Overall, we were impressed with this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lake-park
Michael J.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,24,4,1.0,2/1/2016,"It had been a long day so I decided to order dinner from Applebee's to pick up on my way home. I ordered the Grilled Onion Steak with mashed potatoes. I got there early and they said it had just come off the grill. My house is less than three minutes away. When I opened up my dinner the potatoes were cold and the steak was just ok. No more steaks to go, just a waste of money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lake-park
Daphne L.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",195,73,299,4.0,8/15/2015,"I came here on a Friday around 7:30pm. We were seated right away. We got the 2 for $20 deal with the spinach and artichoke dip as an appetizer, the chicken penne pasta and the chicken fingers with fries basket(upgraded to the platter for $2 more). The spinach and artichoke dip was really good. The portions were a little small though. The chicken penne pasta was really good. It was mixed with a creamy alfredo type sauce and tomatoes and came with a breadstick. The chicken fingers and fries platter was huge. You will be stuffed from eating that.  Our waitress was Cee Cee and she was great. Very prompt at making sure we were taken care of.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lake-park
Crystal A.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",0,3,1,1.0,3/26/2015,"Horrible service. Rude employees! Brought out the wrong order, when we replied with ""no we did not order this"" her responds was ""umm really"" (with an attitude). Ordered a cocktail, tasted HORRIBLE!!! Then asked if they can leave the fireball whiskey out of the drink, her respond um no they're all ready made like that. (I thought it was a mix drink?)  Remodel on the outside looks nice but looks can be deceiving. The inside smells BAD! We had to cancel our appetizer and leave. The employees appearance was unwelcoming. Oh don't let me forgot about karaoke! Who really wants to listen to someone attempting to sing while eating dinner. Not sure if karaoke is an attempt to draw customers but in reality it is doing quit the opposite. I will never return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lake-park
Dong G.,"West Palm Beach, FL",3,2,,2.0,4/8/2016,"Ordered House Serloin Steak but came out very dry and steam veggies are old,not fresh. Server rarely checks on you. Never cleared extra glasses, didn't take menu out of the table. Really bad experience....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lake-park
Rachelle F.,"Houston, TX",233,540,372,2.0,9/16/2014,"I don't know what was going on at this Applebees, but the entire time we were there sitting in the bar area, none of the tables were cleaned. It was filthy! We sat at the bar and ordered a drink and an appetizer. They came out quickly and the waitress was friendly. Toward the end of my dinner, she told us that she was letting everyone else go home now and she would cover the rest of the night. I wish she had asked them to clean the tables before going because it reflected very poorly on them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lake-park
Micky M.,"Portland, CT",2,67,42,4.0,3/15/2015,No problem with anything. They were very nice and food came out great. Sweet potato fries were delicious. They are getting a remodel this week and will be closed for 3 days later in the week. Management checked in with us and it was fine,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lake-park
Deanna A.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,5,1,5.0,8/26/2015,Best service and hospitality from any Applebee's I have ever been to. Service from bartender and management on Wednesday afternoons is beyond exceptional!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lake-park
Pat S.,"West Palm Beach, FL",5,11,1,3.0,4/11/2015,Our meals tonight were quite good but we couldn't sit in a booth as we requested because those tables were dirty. Several tables were dirty when we left and customers were coming in. Our server was very good but seemed to be given 5 tables at the same time which didn't seem right.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lake-park
Jami B.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,46,,4.0,10/25/2015,Great remodel! Looks great! Staff was nice. Food was good. Great meal and service. I'll be back. Glad they cleaned up!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lake-park

Brett S.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,142,,2.0,11/6/2010,"Very mediocre. Some of the weight watchers items are decent, but not exceptional. One item to try is the shrimp on spinach salad which is tasty. The decor and atmosphere is dated and tries to provide a pub style atmosphere. Their are many national chain stores that provide a better alternative.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lake-park?start=20
