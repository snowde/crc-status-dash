Stephanie H.,"Lancaster, OH",175,68,372,5.0,1/12/2016,"I've been coming to this Applebee's for nearly 20 years. I always receive exceptional service from the wait staff. Rarely do I order alcoholic beverages, yet they always keep my raspberry iced tea filled. I drink a lot when I eat, so I really appreciate the wait staff and their attentiveness.  Frequently I order the Fiesta Lime Chicken and its always perfect every time I order it! When I order my steaks they cook them to order and they turn out just as I ordered. Their curb side service is great and they do well filling large group orders during the lunch hour for offices throughout the area. They are great at accepting their gift cards which I normally purchase at grocery stores. I hope after all these years others will come back a few times a year, as I do, to this chain restaurant, yet part of the Lancaster, OH experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lancaster-11

Rob M.,"Circleville, OH",182,271,1124,3.0,7/12/2017,We like the 2 for $20 menu choices and always substitute 2 Caesar salads for our appetizer choice. Always good service in the bar area and we always seem to get better service in the bar !,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lancaster-11
Chris K.,"Mountain View, CA",68,81,19,5.0,1/21/2017,I was visiting from California so I'm used to Applebee's. First off these waitresses are so nice! I mean really!.... they listen to you they want to make eating fun! Haha I know that sounds . Food was good. The noise levels where up and down due to the buckeyes game! Ps I'm a total buckeye fan! Cheers!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lancaster-11
Angie L.,"Lancaster, OH",0,3,,5.0,3/22/2017,We decided to celebrate a 48th Birthday tonight at Applebee's.  Johnnie our server and Mark the manager could not have been nicer. Our food was delicious and we are loving the new menu! Thank you for a great evening with our family! Brownie bites are the best...yummy!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lancaster-11
Shawn B.,"Lancaster, OH",0,10,,3.0,1/7/2017,"The food is good, but I have to say I was dissatisfied with the with the amount of salad I received. I got the aisian chicken salad, which is one of four salad they offer. It was 11.49 cents my wife got a house salad and there was not much difference in the size. They put them in a huge bowl, bug they hardly put anything in it . I can go to Bob evens get a Cobb salad for about 2.50 cents less and can sometimes hardly finish it. Been changing my eating habits for a while now, but if I'm going to just eat salad it won't be there anymore",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lancaster-11
Melissa N.,"Orient, OH",0,1,,1.0,4/28/2017,"Out of three hostess, only one was seating people. Once we were seated we ordered appetizers through the kiosk on the table, the server took our drink and dinner order...45 minutes later we still did not have our food, had to call the server to the table, she had no idea we hadn't received our food or if it was even ready. We requested the check for the drink and appetizer, the manager did not even come to check on us. Ridiculous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lancaster-11
Ron C.,"Reynoldsburg, OH",2,28,18,2.0,6/2/2016,"The onions rings were good but everything else nah!  I had to send the steak back because there was grill marks on only one side and the manger ""tried"" to explain that what happens when you cook it medium rare.  Then the baked potato was not cooked all the way, it was too firm and had a tan color to it.  The waitress was very apologetic, so l left her a nice tip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lancaster-11
Jed R.,"Lancaster, OH",0,9,,1.0,7/4/2016,Never fails to surprise us. At least they are consistent! The only reason we come here ONCE a year is because we wear out every other restaurantin Lancaster. Service and food are horrible. Only positive thing is happy hour beer prices and the only reason the beer is good is because it comes pre-made out of a keg! Worst restaurant in Lancaster!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lancaster-11
Paul R.,"Brown Township, OH",156,308,9,5.0,6/6/2015,Best burgers from anywhere around. Our service during our last visit was beyond exceptional. I can't wait to return!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lancaster-11
Michele F.,"Saint Louis, MO",6,255,,3.0,7/7/2015,"Its probably one of the better Applebee's I've visited. The food is just average, nothing special, but with these big chain restaurants - I'm not expecting gourmet food. I usually only eat here because it is a convenient place to meet people - its familiar - and has plenty of seating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lancaster-11
Mike C.,"Hilliard, OH",54,250,45,5.0,6/8/2013,"Why review an Applebee's when they are all the same? Well this one had a very nice and attentive server named Paul who was just the bees knees. He seemed new, or was learning a new menu at least, and yet he was very pleasant as well as accommodating. He seemed genuinely interested in providing us with a good experience. On the food side, the salad I had was exceptionally fresh. The dressings were tasty and my kids ate all of their food too. A small miracle that is. I think most of us, myself included, have a negative opinion on Applebee's. This recent visit was a diamond in the rough. 5 apples out of 5.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lancaster-11
Jacqueline L.,"Lancaster, OH",0,1,,5.0,7/17/2014,"Wow... it has been a few years  since I have ate at Applebee's. . And just lets say it was sooo worth the wait.. The food was great , the service was excellent,  and the margaritas and Bahamas mama drinks were the the best I have had in a long time. Definitely look forward to eating there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lancaster-11
Andréa B.,"Lancaster, OH",0,1,,4.0,1/26/2015,"Can t go wrong with Applebee's. Love their ""green apple"" selections. We had server Chelsea on Saturday and she was fantastic. We usually sit at the bar . The servers there are not very good though.. most of them are inattentive and slow with drinks",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lancaster-11
Jordan W.,"Lancaster, OH",3,3,,1.0,8/25/2015,"Sad to write this because growing up in the area I loved coming to this location, but I recently went to celebrate an event in my wife and my life and ordered simple burgers and received my order with the plastic divider still on my Hamburger patty. my server was apologetic however the manager was not and was not helpful in diffusing the awkwardness of the situation, she took the burger off the bill (after I asked her to). I will not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lancaster-11
Jessey M.,"Lancaster, OH",9,6,,2.0,5/29/2014,"I've been to a lot of AppleBee's and this one is really an ""ehh"" at best. Nothing I've gotten has been cooked very well and I leave dissatisfied every time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lancaster-11
John B.,"Lancaster, OH",0,24,1,1.0,9/18/2014,"Took family out for a dinner together. Picked the wrong place this night. Service was slow, food was cold. Started with the server only brining out two of the four drinks. We then ordered an appetizer and the server disappeared. I went through a glass of diet Pepsi while he was missing. He returned and about 10 minutes later, and took our orders. When the appetizer showed my second glass arrived. After that the measles arrived about 20-25 minutes, it was busy, so that was not a big deal and was pretty quick for as busy as it was. The manager came by and asked if everything was good shortly after, and I think the server took that as his que he was done waiting on us. My son started in to the second thing of riblets, and said they were cold, not warm, cold. Meanwhile the server stood at the counter and watched me set down an empty glass. Then his other tables where filled by the hostess. He went to the other tables and greeted them, and then came to get my cup. At this point I had completed my meal, and I was ready to leave.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lancaster-11
Greg M.,"Lancaster, OH",9,76,9,5.0,2/17/2012,Server Ashley is great.  Spinach artichoke dip is ammmmmmazing.  Ordered a ultimate margarita....hold the glass.  Steak was cooked to perfection!  Keep it up Applebee's!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lancaster-11
