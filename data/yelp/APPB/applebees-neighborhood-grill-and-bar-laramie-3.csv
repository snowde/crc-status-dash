Carol M.,"Kampong Pasir Ris, Singapore",1,226,2,1.0,9/24/2012,State law allows alcohol service at 10am but this pos has a policy of noon...I refuse to support a place that dictates my options...Chili's is down the street..same food but you can chose who to support,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laramie-3?start=20

Bob L.,"Laramie, WY",11,259,6,3.0,7/3/2013,"Food is pretty tasty, but the portions for lunch are small... Nothing too special, but I left hungry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laramie-3?start=20
Donita C.,"Northampton, PA",115,79,16,4.0,7/7/2014,"I really like this Applebee's.  The burgers have good flavor and the service is getting so much better and more attentive!  I really like the new managers they recently hired in recent months.  This is why I added an extra star.  They will make sure your food is to your liking!  Well, all I can speak to is the burgers, I won't deviate from a burger at any of these chains. One thing I didn't like, the women's bathroom floor?  My shoes were sticking to it.  Like walking on a fly trap.  It didn't smell clean today.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laramie-3
Allie A.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",84,1854,486,2.0,10/3/2017,"I had lots of restaurant recommendations from a friend who grew up in this here parts, but I was traveling solo and I didn't really feel like sitting in a place by myself for too long and I just kinda wanted something quick but not fast food. This was near my accommodations so I popped in.   Service was pretty slow. Maybe the server was new, because getting anything from more water to extra napkins required me having to remind them twice.  Whatever appetizer I ordered was forgettable, chicken wings, I think. Now I remember why it'd been years since I had stepped into an Applebee's. BONUS:  I got to eavesdrop on a trucker telling the bartender a long-winded story about his ex-wife.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laramie-3
Thomas L.,"Aurora, CO",31,22,,3.0,5/11/2017,"Service was very good, much better then the service at the Applebee's near me in Colorado. Better Applebee's then most because of the small town feeling. Food is like any other Applebee's that you go to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laramie-3
Deepan B.,"Laramie, WY",10,42,29,4.0,1/19/2016,It's the usual Applebee's! Nothing great other than they are open very late and offer a decent selection of beer! The food is pretty standard and just like any franchise. Can always trust on em when you need a late night snack!  The service here is a little slow at times and hard to find a spot during game nights! Mostly depends on when you get there!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laramie-3
Dan C.,"Elizabeth, CO",0,5,,3.0,11/30/2016,"Went for a late dinner after a football game.  Took a little time to get seated, but considering the crowd it was expected.  I was finishing my beer when I ordered another one and was basically told by the waiter that I would have to chug the rest before they could get me another one since they were out of glasses.  I had to wait 20 min to get my next beer since they had to collect and wash glasses.  As the place emptied I watched about 6 employees stand around and talk and had to listen to one of them complain about her entire day.  The food was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laramie-3
Nicholas G.,"Denver, CO",2,1,,1.0,10/31/2015,"Sat in the restaurant for about an hour with no food. We got drinks, but that was it. They couldn't even get us our salads. I saw a table that ordered after us get their appetizer first.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laramie-3
Lina G.,"Minneapolis, MN",10,3,,3.0,8/24/2015,They don't clean the table properly. It's always wet. It makes me uncomfortable and feels like it's always dirty.  Other than that they have good food and to go service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laramie-3

E W.,"Fremont, CA",0,25,4,1.0,9/23/2015,"We stopped by this restaurant for lunch before taking a shuttle to Denver airport.  We waited for our food over 25 minutes after we ordered. Our food was still not ready. However, the diners sat on the tables on our left and right sides got their food even they came after us and we ordered before them. We asked the waitress for our orders. She said the food would be ready in 5 minutes.  We stood up to get ready to leave. The waitress apologized but told us to wait for the food and it's ""no charge.""  We had just left the restaurant without lunch. When we arrived at the hotel, the shuttle was there. We did not have time to get lunch! Applebee's had inattentive services at Fremont CA but this one had good services so I thought we should be okay. However, our orders were left out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laramie-3
Doug L.,"Beaverton, OR",13,59,,4.0,1/14/2016,"Very consistent , been to one then it's the same here. They have a great late night happy hour menu. Love the strawberry margarita.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laramie-3
Megan M.,"Jefferson, OR",0,3,,5.0,8/13/2016,"Enjoyed happy hour at the bar around 6pm on 8/12/16. Very sweet and attentive bartender who took great care of us. Ordered two margaritas and two vodka sodas, plus three appetizers. Bill was only $25!!! Can't hardly eat at home for that price! Will definitely be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laramie-3
Joseph B.,"Laramie, WY",0,2,,1.0,3/29/2016,"This is by far, the worst Restartaunt in Laramie.  If you are lucky enough to get a decent server, your experience will still be ruined by the cooks complete and udder apathy towards their work. Every time we come here, we are completely baffled to see such poorly trained staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laramie-3
Kellie L.,"Provo, UT",0,20,1,1.0,12/31/2014,"We ate there 12.30.14 in the evening. The food was cold, my sons's broccoli was spoiled with black parts on the cut, there was decomposed black lettuce in our salads. Our water glasses had dried on dirt and residue. Dinner was over $100, we were pretty disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laramie-3
C M.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,5,1,4.0,6/30/2014,"Upon arriving we were greeted by a friendly hostess who informed us the wait would be 15 minutes. After agreeing to wait, we looked around and found half of the tables completely empty. With a little prodding, the hostess agreeably sat us and within minutes a server arrived and took our orders. The food and drinks arrived quickly and accurately and the oriental chicken salad and club sandwich were particularly delicious. Next time I'm passing through Laramie and want a reliable meal at a chain restaurant, the Laramie Applebee's will be high on my list.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laramie-3
Gianna B.,"Lubbock, TX",0,3,,2.0,6/9/2014,"My boyfriend and I came here for lunch a few weeks ago. I think it was a Monday or Tuesday. Anyway, talk about DEPRESSING. From the frigid air due to the A/C being cranked up (it's Laramie, not Miami) to the awful mid-2000's pop music playing, this place was downright sad. I felt slightly disheartened after seeing a middle-aged waiter (maybe manager?) sitting and eating his lunch across from a very disinterested waitress. After eating our extremely salty food we left and haven't been back. Go on a week night and sit at the bar if the bartenders aren't too busy texting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laramie-3
Dan G.,"Hood River, OR",5,6,,1.0,3/9/2015,"Terrible service and we got the wrong order.  Appetizers came out one by one even thought it was a combo and we waited over 10 minutes for the casadillas, another 5 minutes for our artichoke spinach dip (greasy and disgusting), then 5 min later the wings which werent the flavor we ordered.  Then 5 min later my steak whole grain salad which was a meager portion, the meat was good but the edge of my plate had greasy fingerprints all over it.  The quinoa tasted musty and gross.  We walked out after complaining to the manager who said she would be right back.  waited 5 minutes and no sign of her returning so we left 10bux and walked out.  Never again and I dont recommend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laramie-3
Concerned C.,"Lincoln, NE",2,26,4,3.0,1/1/2015,"Great service,  cold beer. Food sub par. Over cooked pasta covered with what tasted like once frozen processed cheese soup! Wings bland. Good cheesesticks. Cheap kids meals.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laramie-3

Linda A.,"Belfair, WA",32,24,,5.0,9/7/2015,"Had a wonderful meal (although the fries had a bit too much salt, my husband couldn't eat them).

Wayne S.,"Petaluma, CA",0,277,,4.0,7/14/2012,It was a decent place. It was well decorated for the local area.  I enjoyed our meals.
