We came for the $1 Long Island Ice Teas and some apps. Ice teas were a bit watered down as expected.  All in all food here is reasonably priced. You can get an app, entree and dessert for $20.

Served out of Lowe's igloo counters by a bartender with his entire butt hanging out and boxers showing. Also the bar is filthy fruit flies flying and the fruit tray is so sticky. I don't think this place has seen a deep clean in at least 6 months. Followed by a sewage leak and smell in the bathroom that would make You puke... which they solved by spraying perfume.

Donald W.,"Washington, DC",0,2,,4.0,12/26/2017,"This Applebee's staff is always an issue.  The 1st waitress with green hair forgot about us.  After 30 minutes we asked her when she would be available for us to order our appetizers and drinks.  She said ""it takes her a long time to find things in the computer.""  Finally, we were given a different waitress (Meeka).  She was great!  The food sucks, the drinks were weak as well.   The manager was hiding in the back somewhere.  He/she never came out to see how things were going.  Won't go back for a while.  Hopefully, they'll get enough complaints to get the ownership to make changes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laurel-7

This attention, combined with good food at great prices, in an ambience where I could carry on a conversation without shouting, will certainly bring me back again and again to this location.

They are far too understaffed and the manager does not even help.  I sat there for 20 minutes then finally someone came by.  Then when the food came out, they had the wrong food (belonged at a different table).  The waitress said to me, when she could tell I was disappointed, ""Well, I can only do one thing at a time"". Not her fault though... whoever manages the schedule really does not know what they are doing.  My final problem however was the manager.  She just kept walking by and looking - why didn't she help?  She could have turned herself into a waitress fast and really helped.

You can tell there is only one cook in the kitchen by the quality of the food and wait times. We were one of about 5 tables dining and waited about 30 minutes for our appetizer. I hope they shut down and reopen as a better concept like Chili's or Cava.

Chelsea S.,"Washington, DC",27,150,97,3.0,1/11/2017,"I have always been a fan of Applebees, even back home in Florida. For some reason though my visits haven't been so great. The first time my husband and I ate here I ordered a house salad and the lettuce was rotten - it tasted horrible. I was so disgusted by that, that I barely touched my dinner. I didn't complain or say anything because our server was so sweet and I know it wasn't her fault that the food came out that way.  The second time was about a week ago, my husband and I went here to eat dinner and the food was better, but then the server wasn't all that great. She was handling the bar and high tops so she was always running around and took forever to get our refills.

I came here for a work dinner and got the grilled chicken caesar salad. The salad was HUMONGOUS. I'm not sure if this was the standard size salad or if they thought I was eating for 4. The chicken was freshly grilled, and actually tasted like real chicken (always a plus in my book!) Dressing was way too heavy; I wish I had thought to ask for dressing on the side. Unless you like your lettuce drenched in dressing, get it on the side!  Service was great. Our server was obviously enjoying herself, and she was a hoot all night. I wish I remembered her name to give her a shoutout!

Excellent personality and very professional.  The food was prepared very well. Nice spacious atmosphere and very comfortable dining. Easy to work and eat food in.

Good thing we went as soon as it opened because it was just my table and another. Our waiter was sweet and had a few jokes. He even cracked one about the couch stuffing coming out of the obvious hole I was sitting next to. I was starving. There was food... and it was food. Yeah. Food. I know how horrible that sounds, but it was true. I ordered the lunch special that included a soup and a main entree. I got the chicken tortilla soup and the mac and cheese with honey chicken tenders. There was no chicken to be found in my soup and it was salty, salty, and sour. I was very confused. And tomato-y. It was like super salty and chunky ketchup with a leaf of cilantro. Weird. The chicken tender was a joke. It reminded me of those pieces of bread you put in the microwave too long and they get hard and chewy. Also, it was like half of a half of a tender. Three pieces of chicken. I know it was a lunchtime deal, but y'all didn't have to do me like that. I must say that the honey that dripped from the chicken and onto the mac and cheese was delicious, though. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the flavour was lovely. Yep. That's Applebee's for you. Enjoy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laurel-7

Jeff H.,"Fairfax, VA",0,8,,1.0,6/16/2017,"Kept trying to find reasons not to post a negative review for them but i just couldnt handle it. First off me and 2 friends went in, got seated. Our server came shortly her name was Courtney. Keep in mind this is not our first time coming to applebees and i usually always get the same stuff. I ordered the same drink i've gotten from other applebees (the peach quencher ice tea) . 10 mins go by and we get our drinks. I first noticed my tea looked like my friends regular mango tea. My tea was supposed to come with peach slices. I asked her isnt my tea supposed to come with ""real fruit"" that it states on the menu. She immediately says No. i brushed it off no big deal. Right when we got our drinks my friend places a order for the $14.99 appetizer thing ahead of time while we look over the menu. 15 mins later Me and my friend decide to get the 2 for 25 . Our appetizer was onion rings..please tell me why the onion rings came out before anything. At this time we started eating the onion rings and i notice we didnt have any silverware no napkins and most importantly NO SAUCE?!  Like c'mon mannn just brought us a plate of onion rings?!? Wtf!  Still keeping my cool. Our server payed more attention to other tables beside us. As she walked away i had to yell her name just to ask her to get us some sauce. An hour goes by and still no $14.99 app thing we ordered as soon as we came in. Thought nothing of it. Mistakes happen. Then, our main food comes out. Yet , still no silverware.. i guess we're supposed to get our own? The server walks by and manager walks by and says ""oh i'll go get them some silverware""... didnt kno it was that complicated. The host at the door came by and asked us if we needed refills TWICE! I had to be a little rude and ask ""am i supposed to eat with my hands?!?"" He immediately went and got us some . Even after all that time and our food was cold i still managed to keep calm. I've worked in the food industry for 12years. I kno how it is but c'mon. Show some respect. Treat others how u would want to be treated. So what if youre tired. Get the damn work day finished. Dont halfass it .if it was you or your mother or father in my shoes.. wouldnt u give them the best service and want them to be respected... the server came by ONCE during our meal. Thats when my blood started boiling. I immediately asked for the check . Got the check and i couldnt believe it... never got the appetizer we ordered but we're still getting charged $14.99 for it. At that point i was pissed. The audacity. Told the server she went and checked .. and yes they forgot. Asked me if i still wanted it i said NO! Paid for my stuff and left. This visit really pushed my buttons. Oh and mind the fact that it was someones smartass idea to have a loudass art instructor teach a painting class of 30 people. All i kept hearing was the class. Simply retarded. People are trying to enjoy a nice quiet meal. I just want to say to these young servers ... GROW UP! DO YOUR JOB! Doesnt matter what kinda job , do your best! Act like u love the damn job.. dont have to actually love it. Just atleast pretend. Horrible meal thumbs down to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laurel-7

At least ten minutes pass by and neither the manager or our server come back to check on us. We were in a bit of a time crunch, and the lack of service is unacceptable.

We waited a long time for our ""strawberry limeade"". Everytime the waiter would come back she keep saying your strawberry lemonodie would take a while. At one point we corrected her but she said the 2 drinks were the same thing. When it did come it looked like a margarita or daiquiri and tasted alcoholic. We even asked another server but was assured it was a limeade as well. When our apps came the mozzarella sticks were cold, pretzel sticks were gross, and salsa & chips nasty. Salsa was very watery and almost half of the chips were broken. Our burgers came out and we both noticed the fries weren't cooked. Half way thru our meal my friend discovered a piece of debris in the bottom of his fries. We both got grossed out and couldn't eat anymore. Ended up contacting our server & a manager came over shortly. Manager asked whats the issue with the daiquiri. That was the issue we never ordered one. We also explained what the issue was with the rest of our orders. Ended up removing the apps and the one drink but felt like they should have done more. Felt like I got robbed $26.47 from you guys.

David J.,"Beltsville, MD",0,14,,2.0,2/11/2017,I usually like Applebee's but not this one. The bar is off to one side directly in front of where you come in. This is the second time we have been here in the last year. Again the bar noise was very loud and affected the whole restaurant. They need to remodel this Applebee's and make it like the other ones there the bar is in a sunken area in the back middle. I have never minded those.

It wasn't overly crowded when we got there on a Saturday around noon which is really fine by me. Our waitress (Dani) was on top of things and super friendly with a great sense of humor. I went for the Signature Sirloin under 550 calories meal. (Watching my figure for the new year). Very tasty. Although, it has a slightly different configuration from the Bowie Applebees. Still, I enjoyed the meal. A plus - when I checked in on Foursquare and it tweeted out, Applebees connected to ask how lunch was on Twitter.  I like places that do that.   So, I'm good with this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laurel-7?start=20

Su K.,"Washington, DC",229,428,582,2.0,8/7/2008,"Eating good (with hard nipples) in the neighborhood. I consider myself a warm-bodied dude, but even I could cut glass after being in here for about 15 minutes last week. Not a good place for a date unless for some odd reason, you want to show her where your nipples are. Food - I usually order the riblets ($10.99). It's mostly bone but the meat isn't too bad - almost good enough to put in those BBQ rib sandwiches from elementary school. The wife ordered the crispy orange chicken bowl ($10.49), which was ok. My favorite dish--and I use the term loosely--is the chicken wing appetizer, which they were out of the last time I went (BOO!). Among the chains in the style of Waiting, Friday's has JD sauce & french onion soup, Ruby Tuesday's has the chocolate tall cake, Bennigan's (RIP) had the Monte Crisco and baked potato soup, but Applebee's doesn't have anything distinctive. Location - Typical Applebee's decor and layout with the A/C on full blast.  In logic-defying fashion, there's generally a wait here after 7p.m. I once came after 9:30 on a Friday and we didn't have a hostess greet us for 10 minutes. We don't know if she ever came b/c we left at that point. I'd recommend eating at 3 Bros., Longhorn, Shane's Rib Shack, and even Shopper's Food Warehouse over this place.

Needless to say, it was very loud and like an amateur version of American Idol. As a vegetarian, I tried to order an entree on my latter visit, but none were available automatically vegetarian. I asked the server if it would be possible for me to just remove the chicken from the entree, and he appeared baffled and told me he didn't know if it would be possible. Honestly at that point, I didn't care if he just ate the chicken himself or picked it off the plate before he delivered it! Ordering food with minor alterations should not be that difficult. Once I did get the entree it was a combination of too rich and horribly bland, it definitely sat like a brick in my stomach.

Sara N.,"Rockville, MD",13,70,,1.0,12/30/2008,"How many vegetarian entrees can you find at Applebee's? Answer: None.  As a result, I did not enjoy my Applebee's experience. TGI Friday's had the 'veggie pasta' option, which I am not a fan of because it forces the veggie inclined to pay $10+ for a dish. (That's even assuming you like pasta). Still, it's better to have that option rather than nothing.  So I was forced to get a cheese quesadilla appetizer (asked for no bacon). It was basically like a pricy, bland cheese sandwich. I actually asked about it and Applebee's 'policy' is that they can take the meat out. Errr... a vegetarian diet is actually not 'the absence of meat'. You can make delectable dishes with the right spices, veggies, and (if you want) cheeses. If anything at least a restaurant can have a veggie burger option, which is apparently a common request.  I'll say one nice thing that the service was good and the manager was empathetic. He spent a while talking to us, which was cool of him.

After Christmas, I went there alone for a quick bite, and was seated by a dreadlock waiter and told that he'll be right back. After almost 10 mins of waiting without menu, had to get up & help myself to a menu from a counter, then wait some more for him. Finally when he comes, I told him what I wanted to order & of the $10 voucher. He said not to worry and present it when check comes. I ordered something worth 12 & no drink. Food came in less than 5 mins, spich is very wilty & partially cold, as is the baked potato. Chicken is hard at the edges & rubbery in the middle. Forced myself to have few bites and wanted to pay, but no waiter in sight. I saw few waiters chatting away by counter when there is not a single soul in the whole restaurant, but they could care less than to check on me, when I'm looking around, so I had to get up, wave to them and still walked over to them, as they simply stared in my direction, instead of walking over to me. I asked for the check, which he brought & I gave him my credit card AND THE VOUCHER FOR $10. I got it back in 2 mins, placed on my table. When I opened it, saw that  they had  my cc $14 and not deducted the $10. At this point, since waiter was MIA, I got up, walked ove and asked to speak to the manager, who appeared after another long wait. He mumbled an apology about charge but no explanation about cold, wilty ""food"". He brought me another charge of $4 BUT NO RECEIPT FOR REFUND.
