Marina R.,"Dallas, TX",91,119,273,5.0,11/9/2017,"This is the first Applebees I've been too that I have YET to have a bad experience with. Each time I visit I'm seated promptly, I have a nice waiter/waitress, and my food is always great. It really helps that they have daily drink specials as well - usually I end up here after a bad day haha. If you want to live through me, here is my typical order:  Appetizer: Spinach Artichoke Dip Entree: 8oz. Sirloin cooked MEDIUM with double steamed broccoli  Drinks:  2 Washington apple shots (at least)  The food here is honestly not bad, and I think you'd be surprised at the flavor of their steak.  Parking here is amazing & plentiful. They offer curbside to go if that's your thing.  Visit this location - it's better than the rest.

Jessika C.,"Lewisville, TX",0,6,4,1.0,9/22/2017,"Horrible experience. We got to the restaurant at around 9:30pm, ordered at around 9:45pm. It's now 10:40pm and two people in our party are still waiting for their meals. Our drinks haven't been refilled once the whole time we've been here. My order as well as my fiancé's was wrong. When we did get our food, we had to wait for utensils because they didn't have any clean ones. The food was cold. We had to get our own drinks from the bar. Apparently, it was our waitress's first night. She was trying but she was getting frustrated. Finally, another waitress who normally works at the bar came to the rescue. She knows my mother and she took care of things. After all of this, I'm not sure I will come back to this location again.  Side note: The time is now 10:55pm and we just got those two meals...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lewisville-5
Krystal W.,"Duncanville, TX",104,124,357,1.0,8/5/2017,"Nope. Nope. Nope.  Came here for lunch and should have turned around as soon as I walked in.  Our server was apparently new...and he kept reminding us of that every 5 damn minutes.  I ordered mixed veggies and a plain baked potato. The server came back 5 minutes after my order to tell me that they don't serve potatoes before 4pm. Smh.  So then I ordered a side salad with Italian dressing, instead.  Again, 5 minutes later, he comes back and says ""oh we don't have Italian dressing""....okay, I understand being new, but this is getting annoying.  Also, each time he came back, he never took the initiative to refill my CLEARLY empty glass until I finally mentioned it to him.  I gave all this a pass because he's new....but... The food was horrible too. How do you mess up a damn salad???  First of all, they brought me a salad with items on it that I asked not to have. (The waiter kept blaming the kitchen, which even if it was their fault, he shouldn't do that) Secondly, it was cheap ass iceberg lettuce. Thirdly, the lettuce was old, brown, and wilted.  I would never come back here or recommend anyone to come here either!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lewisville-5

Meg C.,"McKinney, TX",112,172,341,3.0,2/18/2017,"The reviews here flat out suck, but I've never had a terrible visit.  Though I've only been here three times in the last two years, both times have hit the spot. I think it's all about setting the correct expectations. Two out of the three times we've come in, we waited several minutes for someone to acknowledge or seat us.  Service once seated has always been quick and attentive.  I order the All Day Brunch Burger because you can't go wrong with hash browns, bacon, egg, and cheese on a burger. The burger patty is well seasoned and overall pretty tasty.  I also substitute sweet potato fries for the regular fries. Cleanliness is questionable and concerning - all three times there were several tables not bused and trash all over the floor.  If you can get past this and the spotty service, you should be fine.Be sure to check out their happy hour specials!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lewisville-5
LaToya M.,"Farmers Branch, TX",86,166,100,2.0,7/15/2017,"Every time I eat at Applebee's I'm reminded of why I don't eat here.  I had a gift card so a friend and I stopped for apps and a drink.  I ordered the steak quesadillas with no onion.  They brought out a crunchy quesadilla with just meat and cheese because I said no onion I was told that meant I didn't want Pico which also includes tomato, jalapeño, cilantro and lime.  I asked to bring it on the side along with salsa and sour cream.  While waiting I took a bite just to see how the meat tasted and it was dry and flavorless.  I can't imagine the meat was prepared that day.  It tasted like old meat that was in the fridge and reheated.   I wish I would have taken a picture to show how the meat and cheese was so skimpy that it only covered only the inner half of the quesadilla.  I ended up sending it back because there was no saving it no matter what condiments I added.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lewisville-5
Rick M.,"Lewisville, TX",19,13,38,5.0,11/14/2017,"Absolutely no issues with food or service.  I had no wait at all to be seated or to meet my server. Appetizer hit the table in 6 minutes. And the food 5 minutes later. Aaron, our server was engaging and positive the entire meal. The place was not loud or obnoxious and the mix in the music was not enough to drive anyone running for the car.

Jonathan T.,"Dallas, TX",26,16,3,5.0,7/26/2017,"Ok, I've been an Applebee's hater for the past 5 years now, but they've redeemed themselves last night. Surprisingly, EVERYTHING was on point! After getting turned down at On The Border, because we arrived there a lil too late, we came down to the choice of either Razzoo's or Applebee's. Both have often let us down in the past, but we wanted to give them a shot again.  Applebee's won by a hair. When we got inside, it smelled better. It felt better. I knew it was going to be a great experience from that point on. Our waiter was polite, considerate, and attentive despite her workload, and the bartender made us some awesome margaritas. We ordered the beef nachos and wonton chicken tacos as apps and I had the 8oz top sirloin with a side of fried shrimp, bacon mac & cheese, and classic fries. Everything was hot, fresh, and actually tasty this time! I don't know if they got a new manager, better cooks, or if it was the better ingredients, but Applebee's have made it back to my list of potential restaurants again.

Toni O.,"Mineral Wells, TX",0,9,,1.0,10/27/2017,"Absolutely horrible establishment!  I went today for my son's birthday for dessert. We ordered his dessert and a Margarita for myself. The waitress brings out drinks and served mine with a nice little disgusting bug in it! She takes it back per my request and returned with another Margarita. Now, I am pretty grossed out, but I kept my cool. I left the new Margarita at the corner of the table. The manager comes over, laughs and asked if I was served with a fly in my drink. I said,indeed and I don't want another as I know they make this pre-mixed and it could have more bugs. The manager took my drink and says, ""sometimes we get bugs in here""then, proceeds to take the drink back to the bar. The manner less bartender yells out what's wrong with this drink? I yelled if I didn't want the first drink with the bug,a second was not going to cut it! We walked out!

Terri K.,"Lewisville, TX",2,3,1,1.0,10/21/2016,"Went to dinner the other night with husband and a friend. It was about 8:30, we walked in and there was no one in front of us, but still had to wait about 5 minutes for someone to notice us. Our waitress was prompt in taking our drink order and then our food order. We ordered our meals and also a to go meal. She asked if we wanted that prepared so that it came out just before we left. We said yes.  A runner brought my husband's food, our friends food, our to go order, bagged and ready to go. But I had no dinner. My meal was not even prepared. By the time I got my meal. The others were already finished eating.  We also had to go hunt down our own silverware. It's really irritating to see our server standing around talking and chit-chatting while we are having to get our own silverware.  This Applebee's seriously needs to get new management and a lot more training before I go back again!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lewisville-5
Tricia M.,"Cuba, MO",0,1,,1.0,10/21/2017,"Our food was dry, and looked like it had been sitting out all day. It probably was and likely reheated in microwave. Absolutely terrible.

Adam B.,"Fort Worth, TX",23,6,12,1.0,10/10/2016,"Do not go to this applebees unless you want them giving away your property! Gave away my keys the day my grandfather passed away! They have cost me Hundreds of dollars to replace my keys! I went to this applebees because I had not eaten all day and just lost my grandfather and needed some food,I was distraught and left my keys on the table. So after getting back to my apartments maybe 3 minutes later down the street,I called back and asked to talk to the manager. He asked me to describe the keys I was able to describe them and produce an identical keychain with more of my keys on it, because I have a lot of keys. So he gave away my keys to someone that said they were his brothers keys, without asking to describe them! The story the manager told me made no sense! How did his brother get home without his keys? I asked did he get the license plate,no he did not he said. The fact that he asked me to describe the keys and he did not ask the person he gave them away to describe them was ridiculous! They are supposed to be paying me back but have just been blowing me off time after time. The owners of this restaurant are supposed to call me  as well but it has been well over 2 month's nothing!

Eboni H.,"Irving, TX",149,3,,1.0,10/5/2017,"This place doesn't even deserve a star to be honest. Just left here. Sat at the bar, wasn't acknowledged for several minutes by Shantel (I think her name was) even though she talked to the guests sitting right next to us. I had to catch her eye and smile for her to speak. Then we asked for waters which we never got after 10 mins. We moved to a table. Horrible service there too. Waitress forgot to ring in our drinks until we asked about them after 20 mins and she replies what did you guys have again. Took ten mins for the waters. While we are waiting, her friend walks up to the table and says ""your man better tip my friend or it's going to be a problem"". We finally got our drinks. Waited another 20 mins for our food. Guy walks past us with our food, gives it to another table. He puts the food down in front of the other people, to which I'm sure they said it wasn't theirs. Then he tries to bring it to our table. I'm a server and bartender. If the food hits the table, it has to be remade. You can't give it to another guest. So we had to ask for it to be remade and it took another 20 mins. Manager was either sitting at the bar, sitting and laughing with servers or nowhere to be found. This is just sad. No excuse for this type of service AT ALL.

Then, after we received our food, the American Burger came WITHOUT lettuce, tomato, and onions (which we later learned had to be keyed separately to order!) . . . then, it took about 10 minutes to finally get the lettuce and tomato (after the burger and melted cheese got cold!) . . . we spoke to a manager who apologized.

It is not okay to call people liars and tell them they can't speak to you and to leave your restaurant when all we wanted was to pay for what we ordered in the correct way.

Bonnie W.,"Lewisville, TX",0,4,,5.0,2/23/2017,"When my daughters and I came in tonight we could tell that they were catching up from a busy night. It is income tax season after all, I received mine today. Our server was a very friendly, enthusiastic, energetic young lady named rachel. She wasn't acting fake...she is a genuine ray of sunshine. I usually tip around 15 to 20%, even if the service is horrible, just because I know the service industry. I never write reviews...but she deserves a shout out. My almost 15 y/o asked how old you had to be to work there...Rachel told her and then told her to slow down after my daughter told her she was wanting to make her own money. My daughter then stated that she would be scared to be a server and Rachel told her that could do it and that she believed in her. What Rachel didn't know is that my daughter has been having a hard time in ""teen"" life right now and those words meant more to us than she could ever know, even though she was referring to being a server. I am so glad my daughter got to hear it from a complete stranger that doesn't even know our situation. I left her a $50 tip. I know it's not really much but I hope it made her 1/2 as happy as she made me. I wrote her a little thank you note explaining the difficult times and thanked her from the bottom of my heart.

Kristin G.,"Allen, TX",369,8,3,1.0,11/12/2016,"So disappointing. This is one of the Applebee's that makes the blonde still. At the end of our date night all I wanted was a blondie. I called ahead to make sure they had them. We got there a little before 11 and I immediately sat down and ordered the dessert with an extra scoop of ice cream. After 20 minutes the blondie came out... without the extra scoop of ice cream. I told her about the ice cream and she immediately apologized and went back to get it. We poured the sauce on top that was so thick it was more the consistency of butter than the traditional syrup consistency and went to dig the spoon in and couldn't even cut a piece off. Immediately we could smell it was so burnt. She came back with the ice cream and I told her the brownie was black on the bottom. She immediately took it. The manager never came over and addressed it. He walked around looking like he was the maddest/saddest person alive. After another 10 minutes she brings out the next blondie. This time we got the same terrible consistency topping and it was literally a tablespoon worth (it usually comes with 1/3 cup ish). We spread out the topping and went to take a bite. Although we could cut into the top the entire bottom was gone. At this point it was getting late, we were tired and didn't see the waitress or manager. We cut off the bottom and ate it, paid for it and left. The attentiveness of the manager was terrible. He should always check on the table when an item has been returned. I still can't believe I paid for such a disgusting dessert. All I wanted was my freakin blondie. Guess I'll just head back to the McKinney location. Don't waste your time.

After being seated, are waitress tells us she's had a bad shift and asked if we wanted to know why. I said ""sure"" and she tells us that the kitchen staff just showed up. I don't think that's something you tell a customer but okay, we ordered.  After about 25 minutes the waitress comes back and says sorry, we're behind about 10 tickets. Our table all just look at each other as she left our table. We put 10 minutes on our timer and if no food came out in those 10 minutes then we would leave.  About 5-7 minutes later, our food arrived. Well, they brought the wrong food to our table but then brought our food. It's only 2 stars because the food was not that bad. I don't see Applebee's as a company being around that much longer. I think Chili's is taking over the space.

I stopped by this Applebee's about a week ago with my crazy friend M when we were starving STARVING. We were so hungry, we were about to start gnawing on our own arms.  So you'd think that with that level of hunger, anything would taste like the nectar of the gods/the most amazing thing ever/YUM FOOD GIMMIE NOM NOM.  Sadly, that was not the case.  First of all, when we walked in, we stood alone at the door for quite a while. When someone finally came up, we made our way to the smoking section (less crowded and slightly less noisy, until the hyena-woman in the bar area started cackling) and sat.  Our waitress was friendly enough, I guess, but she really didn't care. Our Dr Peppers were disgusting. The soda/syrup ratio was so so incredibly off that even in our states of absolute hunger and thirst, we couldn't force it down. When we brought it to our waitresses attention she was just like, ""ummm.. I can mention it..."" and offered water or another beverage instead. She just didn't care.  The menu is standard Applebee's underwhelming fare. I used to like one thing at Applebee's (it was so many years ago, I completely forgot what it was called), and of course they took it off the menu. Nothing on their menu strikes me as terribly unique. They DO have their ""Under 550 calories"" section, and I eventually picked an item from there since it seemed to be the least offensive item.  ...and it was gross. It was the Chicken w/mushrooms thing. Grilled chicken topped with mushrooms, tomatoes, onions, Dijon sauce (which I had them leave off), and an 'aged Cheddar'. The chicken itself wasn't bad. It was cooked well. the mushrooms were alright, but the onions were overwhelming. The cheese was weird. Cheddar is typically an excellent melting cheese. This cheese didn't melt. It kind of congealed and browned without melting. It had a weird flavor and a bad aftertaste. I removed the clump o cheese, the onions/tomatoes, and just ate the chicken with some mushrooms. That was alright. Not worth the $10+ I paid, but palatable. The small portion of potatoes was good. The veggies were decent, but more wilted than fresh-looking. Our waitress was mostly absent and when she was there, she just didn't care. She asked how everything was because she had to, but we probably could've said ""It tastes like death!"" and she would've responded 'great, great. let me know if you need anything!'.  Overall, it was a standard Applebee's experience. I am continually underwhelmed by their boring, mediocre, reheated from frozen food.  For what it's worth, the people behind us were smoking clove cigarettes which made me want to vomit the whole time they were there. Most places (that still allow smoking) don't allow anything other than plain cigarettes. Apparently, Applebee's doesn't care.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lewisville-5?start=20

Both my wife and I had a shrimp and steak dish and the shrimp were cold.  The vegetables were weak and overall very unappetizing.  We informed the server and she had the manager come over and address the situation.  The manager was very nice and offered remedies.  We don't normally accept discounts or offers to refire the dish because we don't want to appear that we are looking for something for nothing.  We just want the management to know of the problem, he was very gracious and talked to us for a couple of minutes and we believe that he will address the problem, too bad the qualifty control isn't up to par in the kitchen.

She was having to go across the room and back and forth. But I give a 3/5 because the waitress got our drink orders wrong but then went a head and did not charge us for it, which I thought was nice. I was VERY unsatisfied by the side of shrimp. We just felt like munching so we ordered the 7 grilled shrimps. I was shocked when they brought out 7 tiny pieces of shrimp (the ones smaller than the ones in Chinese food or frozen meals). I have never seen restaurants serve food like that before.

Here in the 3D world, we sought sustenance after a drunken evening at the broom closet that is Hattricks (fodder for a future Yelp).  After 11pm most of the casual dining joints shut down in the Lewisville area.  The apple shaped beacon visible from the highway promised more beers and some quality grub.  Wrong. Wrong. Service was extremely slow, exacerbated by the fact our server had friends at a nearby table. We ordered several appetizers, as they were half priced after 11. It was readily apparent our order had been sitting under a heat lamp, significantly reducing the crunch and flavor of our selections. The onion rings were bearable.  I'm not sure if I've ever seen a manager at an Applebee's. Do they exist? Look, we've all been to Applebee's. We go for the same reasons. It sucks, but is a necessary evil on occasion.

Michelle W.,"Irving, TX",139,56,34,2.0,9/24/2012,"This location leaves much to be desired. While other Applebee's locations I have visited as of late have really impressed me with their all around great food, service and atmosphere; this one may as well be an entirely different chain all together.  Upon entering the restaurant; the air is stale, and it smells like everything with a fabric surface needs to be throughly scrubbed. This location looks like it's long overdue for a remodel.  The service was slower than it's other Applebee's counterparts, but the food is actually the most disappointing of the entire visit. My soft drink was lacking enough syrup, so I ordered another variety of soda and it too had the same issue. For an entree I ordered a salad and pasta combo. The salad portion was fine, but it was the pasta portion that was most disappointing. I had ordered this same dish from another Applebee's the week before and it was fresh and delicious, however this one tasted like it had an over abundance of onions that were grilled for another dish. In the original incarnation of this dish, the onions were just an accent, whereas this time at this location, it's like they were added as filler and were not even intended for that dish. It was a big disappointment to be expecting something entirely different.  The service was incredibly slow, I felt like my waitress only checked on my as an after thought. Overall, it's as if this location is on a whole other page altogether. I do enjoy the Applebee's chain very much, but I highly recommend avoiding this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lewisville-5?start=40

Allie, our waitress, served with a smile. She was prompt with our drinks, and had a great attitude.  I ordered the 9 oz steak (medium well, slight pink), topped with grilled onions, with corn & red potatoes. Dude, 1st of all I am a corn lover. I can eat corn everyday in every way...tell me how that was the nastiest corn ever! My 8 yr old said it tasted like the cafeteria corn at her school! It was mushy and old...gross! I had 12 red potatoes that were disgusting too..So I asked for french fries instead, which came out 20 mins later. My streak was cooked great as far as it being medium well and juicy, but hell, it tasted so 2nd hand, and T.V.dinnerish...not to mention they forgot my onions, so when they did bring them, they brought me a bowl of the while damn onion grilled. Of course by that time, my steak was cold... My beverage was a sweet tea with kiwi flavor in addition to a Long Island.  My guy had the chicken tenders/fries...um mediocre. We had onion rings for an appetizer, way too breaded, not a good way to start off at all. He ordered a Pepsi that tasted like Root beer, and exchanged it for a Sierra Mist, which we all know is just a bootleg Sprite. Now....the 1st time we came to this location, was around last year....The grease they used to cook our food was burnt! So yes, the onion rings, chicken tenders was hella gross...The manager came out like he didnt care, went in the back in the kitchen and never came back out, so of course we left without paying for that garbage.  I am so disappointed with Applebee's. This used to be my spot about 10 years ago, hands down. Drinks, spinach dip, the sampler, etc. And now it's literally like a dump. If, and that's only if, I come back, it woukd have to be by invite, I'd only come for drinks.  When I told Allie about how my check was not worth friggin $52.00, she went and told her manager and knocked off $15bucks, still the sh*t wasn't worth $36, but I had to satisfy my curiosity that was misled by the commercials so it was partially my fault. Now normally management comes out when there is an issue and of course he/she did not, and I wrote on the receipt this same frustration.  I am a T.G.I Friday's girl myself, they are consistent and I've personally met the chef. Applebee's is a toilet.

I'm more a ""let's take things a little slower"" kind. But these are personal opinions. The 2 stars came from how long it took get our check, then the even longer time to come get our credit card. We finally had to dig through our three wallets to come up with enough cash to bail us out of there.  Now for the good and bad of the food.  The white queso dip was very tasty. There endeth the good. The steak sandwich was Okay, but lacked any dressing and none was offered. Cheese on top of steak on top of bun. It needed more. The french fries were about the saltiest I ever ate.
