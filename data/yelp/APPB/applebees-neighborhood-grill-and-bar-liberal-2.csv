Gary P.,"Hugoton, KS",0,14,,4.0,8/21/2016,"when this place first opened, it was hit and miss, but the past couple of years it is a favorite place to eat in Liberal. Check out my video:  ",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-liberal-2
Quincy V.,"Oklahoma City, OK",147,417,301,2.0,10/1/2017,"Not so good, fairly disappointing. Applebee's can be hit and miss, but this location really seems to strike out. Although my last experience here wasn't completely horrible, it was well below expectation.  Service was attentive, but the server seemed rushed and annoyed most of the time. My friend didn't get a straw and our server was frustrated at her request for one. She was told to look in her silverware bundle, but guess what, there was NO straw in there! It wasn't particularly busy either, so that attitude didn't make a lot of sense. After we turned down extra drinks for a second time, our waitress seemed even more frustrated and was ready for us to leave.  Speaking of drinks, the patron margarita is lacking here, so I opted to try a ""mucho size"" summer squeeze this time. The drink was refreshing, but way too watered down. Half of the glass was ice too, so it ended up working like an average sized drink at best. No wonder why I didn't order a second one, I wasn't going to waste the money.  The food was okay, but options were limited. They didn't even have guacamole, which seemed ridiculous. There may not be many places to eat at in Liberal, but I don't think this Applebee's is worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-liberal-2
Debbie W.,"Perkins, OK",15,77,100,2.0,1/16/2017,"Everything was decent until tonight. Ordered Bourbon Street chicken and shrimp, got the order to pick up. Got it back to hotel, missing shrimp!!! They didn't give me an itemized receipt which I  needed as well. Went back to same girl who gave me the food to go, who also said ""sorry for the wait it's chaos back there"".. told her I  didn't get the shrimp, she said ""sorry about that"" and did not correct the mistake or give me a credit... I  asked for the receipt that was itemized, and she dug in the trash found crumpled up tickets, and gave me my crumpled up receipt...so what satisfaction did I get out of this?   None! I am really disappointed. I thought this would be my restaurant away from home on the road, but NO more!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-liberal-2
PeggyLea B.,"Albuquerque, NM",3,60,51,1.0,4/19/2016,"Do. Not. Eat. Here.  What a huge disappointment! We were traveling from KC to Albuquerque and saw billboard for this Applebee's...decided we'd eat here (as there's no other sit down restaurant in the vicinity)... BAD DECISION all around... reasons why: hard to find this location; NO HOT WATER IN RESTROOMS (prompts asking if there's even hot water in kitchen); terrible tasting food and beverages as well as very small portions (we ordered boneless buffalo wings and wonton tacos); discourteous, unfriendly and unprofessional employees; and above all, unsanitary and not clean.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-liberal-2
Diane F.,"Fort Sumner, NM",0,1,,1.0,4/27/2017,This was my worst experience at an Applebee's. We had to reorder our food 3 times. Encaustic they didn't have anything we ordered. Never again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-liberal-2
Matt G.,"El Segundo, CA",258,24,21,1.0,12/20/2014,"Cold food, SMALL PORTIONS, lots of messy tables. A definite NO!!  Don't waste your money or your time.  The pictures on the menu DO NOT come close to what is presented on your plate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-liberal-2
Elle T.,"Darrouzett, TX",0,3,,1.0,4/19/2015,"We live in the Texas panhandle, where there are no restaurants, super markets, etc.  We come to Liberal a few times a month to shop at Dillons Market, Dollar Tree, and Walmart.  About once a month we go to Applebee's.  I have never experienced such a variety of qualities with the food, food prep, and service.  I have lived in Los Angeles, Denver, and Phoenix, plus traveled to major cities on business before retirement a few years ago; so I do have ""experience"" in a variety of dining locals.  I was surprised that there is no place in which to make a review on the Applebee's website but Yelp is a great place to voice opinions. Bottom line, out of the past four visits...one was great, one was okay, and two were bad.  The ratings I have seen for this restaurant are very low.  Wonder if we should find a new place to ""dine"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-liberal-2
Jeff M.,"San Diego, CA",16,7,,5.0,4/10/2014,"Double barrel steaks were seasoned well. If u get mashed potatoes, be sure to get them ""loaded!"" Amazing~  Best part about Applebee's is the Perfect Margarita. It has 1800 Reposado instead of that other cheap crappy tequila. $8-$9 each but you'll only need 2 of them. Lol  I'll be back~",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-liberal-2
Gerald P.,"Park City, KY",2,51,4,3.0,10/25/2012,Good predictable.  Nice place to eat in Liberal.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-liberal-2
