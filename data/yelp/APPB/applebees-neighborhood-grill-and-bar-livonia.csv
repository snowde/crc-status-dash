Jessica P.,"Livonia, MI",33,60,3,3.0,8/27/2017,"Three stars because Applebee's has always just had mediocre food where its okay but Ive def had better elsewhere. It is a good place to go when nobody knows what to get because of the variety. You can never go wrong with their ribs and fries, it has always tasted good! Same with the coleslaw. The place is never busy and the workers are really friendly and helpful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-livonia
Hasan H.,"Farmington, MI",0,5,1,1.0,12/5/2017,"This is the worst restaurant I've been to. My wife and I ate there last night, and my wife got food poisoning from their food. She was throwing up at 3 am and I had to take her to the emergency room, the doctor said all her symptoms were of food poisoning. Also, we sat ourselves at a high top in the bar area, because we stood too long in the front. No one welcomed us or even offered us water after we sat down, I had to ask one of the servers if she wanted to serve on our table or not. Food and service are bad. Why even bother be open?! I'd give them 0 stars if I could.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-livonia
Alex T.,"Livonia, MI",34,234,5,1.0,3/25/2017,"Let me preface this review with the fact that I am generally a fan of Applebee's.  I don't expect anything spectacular when I go, but I have been to them enough to know what to expect.  This Applebees dropped the ball in almost every way. A coworker and I went there to watch some NCAA Tournament games on our lunch break.  We showed up and there wasn't a single TV with the games on in the bar area.  It's the NCAA Tournament, one of the biggest sports events of the year, and nobody in the place was on top of it.  After asking to have a couple of the TVs switched so everyone in my party could see, it took almost 15 minutes. Our drinks (waters) took forever to show up.  Our waiter messed up our order, which took forever to arrive, and we had to remind him of what we had asked for several times. Overall, it was the worse experience I have had at Applebee's.  Generally, I believe Applebee's is a good value, but this one certainly is not.  It seems that a management change needs to be made because this restaurant has serious operational issues.  I will likely return to Applebee's in the future, just not this location.  There are too many better options within sight of this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-livonia
Erica F.,"Farmington, MI",65,62,11,1.0,2/4/2017,"Three strikes, you're out Applebee's.  Above the other two lousy experiences I had at this location, this one was the cherry on top of the cake that I refuse to ever come here again. Long story short, we ordered a couple meals from this location over the phone, we came to pick it up, they took the card, swiped it, we signed, we figured the transaction was done. Wouldn't be giving it a one star review if this was where the story ended. A couple hours pass and I believe it is around the time the restaurant must have been closing and we get a phone call from a 313 number so we let it ring. We then listen to the voicemail that was left... There was a few seconds of chatter between employees before the message was left where Applebee's asked us to come up to the restaurant WHILE they were CLOSING because apparently the transaction wasn't fully made. At the end of the message there was more talk between the employees of which I could clearly hear her say ""she'll call back, she was a nice OLD lady""...  We ended up calling Applebee's back to leave them with our phone number because there was no way we were driving up there in the middle of the night for a mistake that THEY made. They never called back, must not have been that serious of an issue.  Don't waste your time at this location. Not to mention, on the last review I posted I received an email from the GM saying to return to their location after 30 days and saying they would be ""back on track with delivering great experience like they should""... Maybe your workers aren't providing this great experience that you speak of.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-livonia
Amanda G.,"Redford Charter Township, MI",71,122,32,1.0,9/29/2016,"I'm finally fed up with this Applebees. It's such a consistently bad experience every time I try to come here. We've seen it all, from waiters that smell like 10 packs of cigarettes burned at once, to waitresses families letting their kids jump in our booth while we're sitting there (repeatedly), all served with extremely watered down drinks. One time we walked in around lunch and the music was so loud we had to yell (I mean YELL) to hear each other across the booth. Since then we not-so-lovingly call this establishment Club Applebees.

Malice M.,"Detroit, MI",27,11,,1.0,10/8/2017,"This place is brutal. Went there on Saturday afternoon to grab a quick lunch. Upon entering, there was one single customer in front of us waiting to be seated. The person who I assume was the manager greeted her and said she had to clean a table for her. The manager then proceeded to clean about 8 tables before returning to seat the single customer. I should add that this was around 1 pm on a Saturday and there were no more than 10 occupied tables. After seating the woman in front of us, the manager returned about 5 minutes later to say that she had to again clean a table for our table of 3. There were over 8 unoccupied clean tables and booths available at this time. By now we'd been waiting over 10 minutes to be seated so we made the educated decision to leave and dine somewhere else. This was only the second time we have tried to eat here and actually never made it to a table. Sorry I can't comment on the quality of the food, but the service is quite atrocious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-livonia

Cristina B.,"Chesterfield, MI",260,137,64,4.0,3/16/2015,"This brand new location is absolutely beautiful. Without a doubt the cleanest Applebee's I've been to! While the lobby is lacking, I've been here a few times already and never had to wait long so I don't mind. Service can be hit or miss, but I've given them the benefit of the doubt considering they are still a new location. This location has great TVs to watch the game so be prepared for a longer wait on game days! They also have great coupon specials so look for those as well. Applebee's itself is always changing their menu. My guy and I ordered a spicy shrimp appetizer last time and it came out kind of thrown together. Looked nothing like the picture but at least it tasted good! As for my chicken chicken wrap, it was thrown together as well and fortunately, I wasn't able to eat it as a wrap. The whole thing fell apart when the server set it on the table! I would've asked for a new one but I didn't want to bother our already busy waiter.  Despite this, my guy and I each enjoyed our meals and were happy with our overall service. Without a doubt, one of the cleanest Applebee's I've been to and the one with the best food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-livonia
Michael P.,"Livonia, MI",0,67,,2.0,4/29/2016,"Feels a little weird critiquing an Applebee's but felt the need since I've been to this one at least 3 times and the experience has been consistent. VERY LOUD!!! Newly built, they have Bose speakers throughout, and they love to crank them. It's more like a night club than a family restaurant.  On this occasion I opted for the tried and true Burbon Street Sirloin. When the manager asked how it was, I mentioned that it was not what I had come to expect. Manager stated in a condescending tone that it's because ""they now use a much higher quality beef."" Be it as it may, the old cut had much more flavor and tenderness.  Needless to say I did not finish nor take home. So long Burbon Street Steak!

Andrew B.,"Livonia, MI",4,4,,1.0,4/7/2016,"Have ALWAYS loved applebees but this time permanately ruined this location for me. After finally deciding to get out of the house after a recent series of traumatic events, all we wanted was a burger and a beer. We are both pretty easy going and always tip well, being that we both used to be servers. Basically, our server ignored my request for water when I clearly needed it to take a medication before dinner and I made that obvious. Food took nearly 45 minutes and the burger my girlfriend ordered was wrong completely. When we told the manager she basically biffed us, and insisted the burger was done right. Whatever. She ate it and didn't make a fuss. I could go on but the main point is that the service and food was terrible and if we asked for anything it took forever to get it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-livonia?start=20
Jessica O.,"Macomb, MI",0,23,,5.0,1/17/2016,"I previously wrote a very negative review on this location over an obnoxious, lazy and completely inefficient bartender who we had a poor experience with on multiple occasions. I vowed I would NEVER return to this location but my fiancé convinced me yesterday to give it another try. I reluctantly did, and chose to sat at the bar after seeing there was a different bartender.  This experience was like night and day! I believe our bartender's name last night was Jamison- he was pouring drinks for not only a completely full (and quite large) bar, but also for the entire restaurant BY HIMSELF. He took our drink order immediately, asked if we wanted to eat, ensured we liked our food, and our drinks were never empty. He was so friendly and really made sure the customers were taken care of.

The service was good, waitress was attentive and responsive. Went just after lunch crowd, so quiet and decent service.

The appetizer were hot and fresh. Taste was great.  Service to this point is out standing.  Dinner came out hot and ready. The stake cooked just like I asked for. Perfection in the food and service. This place is great for family an I love the local school pictures.  Tyler worked our table and did an outstanding job.

Melvin J.,"Detroit, MI",11,1,,5.0,8/31/2015,"I went there today and my waiter (Tim) was excellent. He made my children laugh by giving them riddles for free refills and even though my food took about thirty minutes the manager (Margaret) came over to check on us and update and brought out our kids food while we wait. The service there was excellent and I had a great time. Thanks again Tim and Margaret, I hope you guys get recognize for this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-livonia?start=40
Payge T.,"Westland, MI",0,4,,1.0,2/11/2015,"Went there during lunch time and had a pleasant experience. Have gone 3 times at night and every time has been a nightmare.  The first time we didn't get seated for 10 minutes because the hostess wasn't paying attention. Then they got my boyfriends and my food wrong so we had to send it back. The second time we went we were seated right away. My boyfriend ordered and beer, we saw it being poured then we saw it sit at the bar for 15 minutes. I had to ask our server if I should get up and get it or if he will.  The third time we went everything was good until we got our food. We had to send BOTH of our food back TWICE!  Won't be back!! Night staff is very lazy and unprofessional! The manager was the only happy/kind person we talked too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-livonia?start=40

But i came in for carry out the other day and i ordered online well i opted for the PICK UP not car side to go well when i went into the restaurant the i was told to go to carside to go... so i did sat in my car for about 5-7 mins and NO ONE came so I went into the restaurant again.. and told them i was there for a pick up... she said okay and then 5 mins goes by... and nothing... the girl didnt even get the name for the pick up so what exactly was she doing?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-livonia?start=40
Liz B.,"Tampa, FL",0,59,19,2.0,6/4/2015,"I took my niece here for her high school graduation lunch....BIG mistake.  The food was not very good.  I ordered the Triple Hog Dare Ya sandwich with chips (at the waitress' suggestion).  The sandwich was advertised to have pulled pork, ham, bacon, cheddar, and crispy onions.  I didn't see any pulled pork on the sandwich at all, and the chips were overcooked.  When the waitress came by and asked if I liked the chips, I told her no and she just said, ""Well I guess it's just personal preference"".  She didn't offer to replace them with fries, like I thought she should, but whatever.  And before we were done eating, without asking if we wanted anything else, she brings out the bill and lays it on the table.  So I guess she didn't want us to order anything else.  I forgot why I don't like Applebee's, but today's lunch reminded me why I avoid this place!  I'll be sure to patronize another restaurant next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-livonia?start=40
Amanda L.,"Farmington Hills, MI",1,29,17,1.0,4/7/2015,"Honestly disappointing. I've never been a huge fan of Applebee's to begin with , always felt like they had mediocre food with not so mediocre prices, but I had a great experience out in Grand Blanc once I decided to give this new one a whirl.  Our server was training someone and the trainee was really nice and attentive but the trainer seemed to care less. The food took a little while considering how slow it was but not too bad. Once the trainee dropped the food off we didn't see anybody for a long time and were waiting to order dessert. The trainer finally came back over and just offered the check, no asking how out meal was, which was pretty gross to be honest, no offering of dessert. Once we ordered dessert he seemed pretty irritated. While waiting for the dessert I over another table complaining about their pasta, which didn't surprise me at all after I read the rest of these yelp reviews. Dessert came out after a few minutes and he dropped the check off and never came back to check on the food yet again nor did he offer a ""have a great day, come back again"". I won't be back again. The service is absolutely horrible (and I've waited tables for 9 years so there is no excuse for this lazy complacent behavior) and the food is mediocre at best. Spend $5 extra dollars and have an amazing meal at outback across the street. They never disappoint.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-livonia?start=40
Dennis M.,"Redford Charter Township, MI",0,4,88,1.0,2/11/2016,shame on me. this was my 4th and final attempt to eat at this new restaurant. on every visit my food came out cold or 40 minutes after I ordered my food. for a brand new restaurant they have certainly don't care to bring in new customers and keep them happy. TERRIBLE SERVICE and TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-livonia?start=40
