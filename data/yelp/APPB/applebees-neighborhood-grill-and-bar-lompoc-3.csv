Kianna S.,"Santa Barbara, CA",25,23,28,1.0,12/14/2017,"Very disappointed with this restaurant. In December, they have these signs on all of the tables that say if your server doesn't mention buying an Applebees giftcard, you get a free appetizer for your next visit. Our server didn't mention it, so I brought it up to the hostess as we were leaving. She told us that because we stood up from the table they couldn't give it to us. That is ridiculous! It doesn't say that anywhere on the sign. Don't advertise something if you aren't going to follow through with it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lompoc-3
Elizabeth B.,"Santa Barbara, CA",4,103,114,3.0,9/18/2017,"We would have given our visit to this Applebees location 5 Stars....However, the service was AWFUL! We waited about 10 minutes by the hostess stand, numerous employees walked by not saying anything. We grabbed our own menus and sat down at a booth. We started using the electronic ordering system situated on the table to order. (We really liked this feature). Anyway, a waiter came over and asked if we were ready to order, when I told him I was using the electronic system, he briskly left and was NEVER seen again. Th only positive aspect of our visit was the food, it was delicious, 10/10! But, considering we received absolutely no customer service, we don't return on planning to this location:",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lompoc-3

The manager came and immediately asked to see the coupon without asking how we were doing nor introducing herself. Then she proceeded to say that they didn't validate coupons because they were usually a scam. I then explained that it was sent to me by their corporate and had my name and the Applebee's address for here in Lompoc.

Jeffrey S.,"Lompoc, CA",17,1,,1.0,12/14/2016,"Worst service I have had at any restaurant in Lompoc and on the entire West Coast. Myself and my wife took my Mom and Dad out to dinner tonight for their 54th anniversary. 1. I told the waitress 3 times it was my Mom and Dad's 54th anniversary and no one said happy anniversary, no complimentary ice cream or anything. Two separate tables near us had Happy Birthday sang to them. 2. The waitress told me the chicken breast was moist and very tender so I took her suggestion and ordered it. the chicken was charred on one side and dry.  3. The side dishes on my Wife and my Mom's plates were switched so they had to take the plates back and correct it. My Dad's french fries were cold and they had to bring him another order. 4. Our table was not cleared before we left. Nothing was cleared off the table while we ate. 5. They did not carry brandy for my Dad so he Had one Cognac for 10.50 and my mom had one glass of white wine for over almost 9 bucks get outta here at Applebee's are you serious. 6. The restaurant was not busy and it took 1 1/2 hours from the time we were seated until we finished eating because the service was very slow. Management should be ashamed of their selves. Thanks for making my parents 54th anniversary an experience they will never forget.

It took another 10 minutes for us to receive our drinks! Drinks! It was only coke. No hassle bustle drink.  But wait there's more. It took another half an hour for the entrees to come in. The bf had their burger and I got their fish and chips. We were ready to call it a night cancel our order and get out already. We finally got our food after flagging down our MIA server. The burger didn't have any seasoning in it no mayo, veggies or anything it was the patty and bread. The fish and chips were cold and limp. Bland and oily.

Soooo here goes... oh no pics this tym... sorry I am the general of foodies of the central coast. Ans i an fair but firm. I ordered ribblets n fries and quesadia burger n fries and boneless chicken wings for myself. My wife had the bug beef natchos, n the bannana cheese cake. 1st the bad. The FRIES OMG all the Fries i had Were 1 COLD and white (they should be golden brown n crunchy, Not tonyt folks, these are white, cold, and soft. Now if any of you foodies out there know about sides n fries there is only 2 ways this would happen. 1. Tooooo many fries in basket, outer ones are golden and all inner ones are basically steamed. Or 2. They have a set time that they need to keep as a minimum,  ans were just pulled early. Either way they sucked. Also the coffee service was slow, unreasonably slow. With a chain this strong this should not be happening. Coffee drinkers unite let them know im ordering coffee cause i love coffeel. So please i dont like to see the bottom of my cup. All the rest of the food was from ok to pretty killer. The quesadilla burger, beef natchos, n ribblets were killer i recomend.  Our waitress Marissa V. Was awesome i recommend pretty smile very nice manners,  polite, very apologetic about coffee service and fries. Offered to have some made for us. But i declined.

Marcy H.,"Santa Ynez, CA",5,77,55,2.0,11/17/2016,"Decided to stop in for lunch despite my mom's advice not to eat here since she said the food here wasn't very good and to travel 30 min to the Santa Maria Applebee's instead.  I hadn't yelped this place before so I didn't read the poor reviews until now when I decided I need to share my experience. Anyway, we ordered the Cavatappi pasta with chicken, the shrimp stir fry, and the lunch special that included the chicken tortilla soup and a half chicken/bacon club sandwich. First let me say that we were the very first customers of the day. No other people in the restaurant and it was exactly 11 a.m. so I expected to: (A) Get good quality/hot food and: (B) To get it pretty quickly. I was mistaken on both points. The waitress was very nice and so was the host who greeted us however I really must say the cook in the kitchen is not very good. We didn't get our orders for a really really really long time. Exceptionally long for being the only customers in the joint. And when we got our food...well the soup was cold. And so was my sandwich. The bread looked grilled but it was super cold and the bacon was super duper uber cold; as if it was pulled out of the refrigerator and placed directly on the bread. The pasta was actually good however it was unevenly warmed. Very hot in some places in the bowl and very cold in others. The shrimp stir fry was next to terrible; lacking flavor and any sort of spice. Those frozen diet meals are better tasting. I told the waitress about the soup and the sandwich being so cold and she apologized and took them back. When she brought the soup back the crispy tortilla chips on top had melted into the soup and became moosh. Sigh...she really should have offered a percentage off or a free dessert or something. They wouldn't even honor the military discount on any of these meals. Anyway it's sad that Applebee's was so highly anticipated in Lompoc and instead of thriving it is seriously diving. So...as much as I would like to patronize my hometown businesses, I not be back. I will instead drive to the Santa Maria Applebee's since we have had only great experiences there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lompoc-3?start=40

Russ R.,"Lompoc, CA",11,103,17,1.0,7/28/2014,"Third trip was just now (this evening) so they have had lots of time to iron out the bugs since opening. Arrived at 6:10pm to no one at the hostess stand. It only took a minute waiting and a gal showed up and seated us right away at a booth. She told us our server would be with us soon. Our server (Presley) came right away, very friendly and welcoming, asked for our beverage order.  I ordered a Sam Adams Boston Lager and a cold glass, wife ordered Water with a few slices of Lemon. The server brought out the Water and said she'd be right back with my beer. I opened my the knapkin that held the knife and fork, only to see food remains on both the knife, as well as the fork. When Presley brought the beer she apologized they were out of cold glasses, so offered to put ice in a glass to chill it before bringing it. Very thoughtful. I then gave her the utensils showing her the remains of someone elses meal. She apologized and grabbed them up. When she returned, it was with a clean set of silverware, a clean knapkin, and a chilled glass for my beer.  I poured it half way only to notice the glass was cracked all the way down and it had a sharp edge on the rim. I flagged Presley, she was embarrassed and apologetically picked up the glass. She asked if I wanted the remainder of the beer in the bottle, which was nice, but I waited for a new one and cold glass that came out in 2 minutes. So far Aplebees was not scoring well, but Presley was taking it very professionally.  We then ordered our meals. My wife ordering their Chicken Mac and Cheese (and the menu said it was ""loaded with Applewood Bacon),  I ordered the Bourbon Burger & fries. I was asked ""pink"" or ""no pink"", so I said ""pink"", since I order burgers medium rare. Food arrived within 10 minutes, and I could not help but to note that the $10 Mac and Cheese had just a few little pieces of Chicken and I would bet there was not even one slice of Bacon on top (it was chopped up so hard to tell accurately). I guess Applebees thinks one slice makes it 'loaded' with Bacon. Anyway, my wife didn't complain, she said it tasted good. My burger was a different issue. The fries were lukewarm at best, the ketchup container on the table was empty, and the burger bun was wreaking in grease and meat juices. it literally was inedible. I flagged Presley down again, pointed this out, and asked her to please bring me a new lower bun. Within 2 minutes she returned with it.   The only nice part of this experience was Presley. I felt she was very professional in the way she handled everything, and she needs to be working in somewhere less embarassing.  I feel the only reason Applebees is still open is because Lompoc has so few good eating establishments. Carrows was the same way, and they are now closed.  Our two meals cost $29, and with a $6 tip it came to $35.  I can go to Vons and for $35 I can make 4 fantastic gourmet meals for my wife and myself, so why go out only to get dirty utensils, broken glasses, and poorly prepared food.  Makes absolutely no sense.   This was strike 3, and sorry to have to say it, but they are OUT!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lompoc-3?start=80

When we walked through the doors I was shocked to see all the cobwebs, but because it was Halloween I accepted it (kidding). The host took our name and said it would be about a 15-20 minute wait, which I couldn't understand because there were several empty tables. To our surprise, the wait was actually only 5 minutes. The atmosphere was nice, the bar was crowded and lots of TV's. The only issue I had was it was a Thursday night and being a huge NFL football fan I would have thought they would be televising the game. When we asked the host if he would have the channel changed to the game that was on the TV above our table, he gave us a fake smile and said yes....we both knew it wouldn't happen, and it didn't..he just blew us off. We finally stopped the manager and he finally changed it to the game.  As for the food and service, our waitress was very friendly and stopped by our table several times to make sure our food was okay and our drinks were always full. We both had the Parmesan Steak and Shrimp, the picture was on the menu and it looked really good. When we got our meals it didn't look much like the picture, but the flavor was good. The steak was good and cooked the way I like it, although the shrimp was a little overcooked. The mashed potatoes were awesome! I would have liked to have had a soup or salad, and maybe some bread with the meal.

Nemie H.,"Lompoc, CA",0,3,,1.0,4/29/2014,"Went there for my husbands birthday this weekend and I was amazed at how bad the food was.  I ordered a BLT sandwich.  You'd think that would be pretty hard to mess up? Right?  What I got was wilted lettuce and over done bacon coated with some sort of cheese that had been microwaved to a plastic unidentifiable blob all served up on cold soggy toasted bread.  I've never in my life sent anything back to the kitchen... I couldn't get her to take the plate away fast enough. What made things even worse is when the waitress brought out our food and I lifted the bread and looked at the horrifying thing they called a BLT, she said... ""oh that looks gross!""  All I could think is WHY in the world would you bring it out of the kitchen then???  I wouldn't serve that to a goat.  So disappointing.

Bar staff very nicely asked repeatedly if I'd been helped. Got the to go waitress. Was told on arrival that my burgers were ready but we are waiting on a sauce for an appetizer. 15 minutes later sauce finally comes out. Burgers and app have now sat for that long.  Made a comment that the kitchen was jacking the front of house and got told to have a nice night.
