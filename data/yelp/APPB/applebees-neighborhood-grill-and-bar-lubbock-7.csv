Scott B.,"Big Spring, TX",13,410,303,3.0,6/13/2015,Zipped in mainly for a few Happy Hour special apps at 1/2 price. Pretty dismal selection of apps at that special price though. Settled on the Asian Wonton Tacos. Pretty good actually. Service was Meh. My kid liked his kids meal grilled cheese at least...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lubbock-7?start=20
Jessie R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,13,1,4.0,6/3/2015,I came in for dinner after a long day of traveling. I was sitting at the bar and the service was great! The bartender was friendly and attentive to all of the patrons sitting at the bar. My food came out great and within 15-20 mins. Would definitely eat here again for a work trip!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lubbock-7?start=20
Cameron R.,"Lubbock, TX",0,1,,2.0,2/19/2015,"Probably one of the worst restaurant experiences I've have in a while. The waitress took our drink orders and came back 15 minuted later to take our order only to then realize she forgot our drinks. Brought us our drinks and appetizer about 10 minutes later. Didn't return for another 35 minutes to bring us our food, apologized for the wait, but when we started eating we realized our food was actually cold on top. So it appears that she just forgot to bring it from the kitchen. Only checked on us once afterwards when we ran out of drinks, but never actually brought them. Then brought us our check 20 minutes later. She visited the table behind us at least 5 times while we were simply waiting for her to pick up our card to pay. Saw 4 tables fill up, eat, pay, and leave while we were there. Maybe she was just new, I don't know.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lubbock-7?start=20
Pilar P.,"Houston, TX",79,45,28,4.0,7/14/2013,I never eated at applebee's and I  had a good experience. I the beginning our beers were flat (no gas) and they changed them quickly at no cost. I ordered meat with onion soup. The soup was really good. the meat was fine for an American food place it was pretty decent. It came along with some roasted potatoes that had a very interesting zesty taste to them. For 8 bucks all that food was very good for me. The quality was good too. I know this places are hit or miss but at least in my very first experience this was a hit. :) I hope this is helpful! :),https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lubbock-7?start=20
Dave G.,"Round Rock, TX",15,15,2,1.0,8/16/2015,"Well, my bad for even trying this place. In town getting our daughter moved in to her dorm so in the midst of the shopping spree we needed some food. Unfortunately this place was close to one of the stores we needed to go to. Haven't been to an Applebee's in well over a decade, which apparently is long enough to forget about how terrible it is. If it were subpar I wouldn't be writing this. Oh, if only it were. Start to finish it was awful. Our server was quite a price of work, or something. She started off by telling us about how the last 48 hours of her life were, which was mostly complaining about how tired she was from working doubles there as well as her second job. She mentioned that she had showered, thank god, but she damn sure hadn't washed her uniform in well over a week. Suffice it to say it was very obvious that she wipes her hands on her pants, apron or shirt which makes me question her basic hand washing practices. Out of the draft beer I wanted so we ordered UNSWEET tea. We got sweet tea...and there was something stuck to the wife's tea glass. Ugh. The food was delivered by another server. At first I was hoping we had gotten a different server, but he was as sweaty and disheveled as our original waitress. And he apologized when he delivered the food because he was new and had no idea what he was auctioning off to our table. Then I had to go ask for silverware. Our original waitress was sitting at the bar and said they were roping silver because they had been so busy that they ran out. Fair enough. When I unwrapped my silverware, the utensils were still wet (no big deal) but definitely not clean. The waitress said ""oh, is that dirty?"". Yes, filthy. I just need some napkins please. Long story short, between the level of ""service"", the overly chatty waitress ( who told us all about her four kids and a grand baby on the way and what the sex would be) the almost empty restaurant that was dirty and the floor needed attention, I assume there is no one managing that disaster. Never again will I darken the doorstep of an Applebee's. What a dump. Definitely the crappiest chain restaurant in business and that's saying something.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lubbock-7?start=20
Rebecca Y.,"Plano, TX",35,13,45,3.0,2/22/2014,Poor services.  Some waitresses ignore me while I'm raising my hand ask water for a long time. only one handsome waiter came finally and brought water.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lubbock-7?start=20
Michael S.,"Ransom Canyon, TX",3,59,2,5.0,3/21/2014,Great food! Delicious and healthy entrees. If you want flavorful low calorie meals I highly recomend this place. You can get a guilt free dining experience.  The quesadilla burger is a sinful delight!

Taylor W.,"Orondo, WA",0,2,,2.0,5/25/2015,The food was not good at all and the service was worse. I'm disappointed that they redid their menu with new appetizers and such yet it was still awful! Won't be going back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lubbock-7?start=20
Shirley H.,"Abilene, TX",0,5,,2.0,3/19/2015,"Smallest 1/2 sandwich on chiabatta ever. Potato cheese soup was not even warm. Sent back to heat it, but then the potatoes were not even done.

Brianna M.,"Lubbock, TX",0,3,,5.0,5/16/2014,"We had an awesome meal, great server, the place is very open and airy and comfortable, even when it started filling with people for the dinner rush.

Dale B.,"Plains, TX",0,4,,1.0,10/17/2014,"Really bad service, food was good.  Server spent most of the time visiting with an off duty employee.  She checked back on us one time and we never got a refill on our tea.  We had to ask for our check 3 times.  They should not allow off duty workers to distract the people working.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lubbock-7?start=20
Bree D.,"Borger, TX",86,35,47,2.0,7/13/2010,"The food always tastes so pre-packaged instead of fresh. I know that most places like this use pre-packaged food, but this really tastes that way.

Adam D.,"Garland, TX",0,3,,5.0,1/7/2018,"My wife and I stopped in for a beer and ended up having a full meal, which was delicious!  We ate at the bar and met Blake, our bartender! Not only did Blake take care of us like family, but he has excellent recommendations from the menu and even has ""secret menu"" suggestions!  If you would like to retry your experience with Applebee's, then your first stop has got to be with Blake! Come see him, Thursday evening until Sunday!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lubbock-7
Tara B.,"Lubbock, TX",73,247,131,2.0,11/1/2017,"We showed up at 5:30 on a Monday. We had issues with a waiter/waitress because of shift change but that worked out eventually. Our food took 35 minutes to come out. My sons food was cold, my husbands was fine and my medium steak was well done. Like, Dry well done. Shoe leather well done. See pictures. The waitress urged me to send it back, and I finally did. She brought another side of fries for me to eat while I waited. THANK YOU! I was so hungry. A manager brings out my second steak and asks me to cut into it. It, too was well done. What?!? It was juicy, but not pink except the very middle of the steak. Ugh! He offered to take that back too but my family was done eating, I was hungry and just wanted to get out of there. The manager took my meal off the ticket- much appreciated. He said they had a brand new cook on the line whose first day was today. Certainly he isn't the only person there that can throw meat on a grill and watch it.  I don't think we'll be back for a while.  I give two stars because the manager and waitress were nice, even if 2/3 of our meal was terrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lubbock-7
Albert A.,"Lubbock, TX",20,2,,1.0,1/5/2018,We waited for 1hr to receive our orders. Service is not great and advice us to wait more. No complimentary appetizer for the long wait.

Lori D.,"Lubbock, TX",32,1,,1.0,12/2/2017,Horrible experience. We were just drinking and each round took 20 minutes to receive. We are in West Texas and they had unknown football teams on tv.

Will L.,"Lubbock, TX",1,23,5,1.0,11/27/2017,I purchased $50 worth of food for Thanksgiving when I get home everything is dry and horrible in taste.

G A.,"Celina, TX",0,3,,1.0,11/23/2017,"I would give it 0 stars if I could. After waiting 1 hour to be seated (we only had 6) & we asked to be seated with a booth and table for two across from one another but were told they couldn't. Those tables sat empty while they proceeded to sit the 8-10 parties that came in after us. Our waitress was so worried about the people she knew that came in after us that she came and told us she would be back as she went to them & waited on the people she knew. Then we waited another 1.5 hours for our food - my steak came out burnt, my salad never came out & my son's steak came out 1/2 the size of my daughter's (both ordered the same thing). I cannot emphasize enough, DO NOT EAT HERE!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lubbock-7

John S.,"Tyler, TX",10,87,3,3.0,2/24/2017,"Food was good, bar service is slow. It's Friday night, so it's understandable that the bartender's are busy. It stinks that they neglect the bar to do dishes or make drinks for the rest of the restaurant. I asked for a margarita while one of the bartender's was washing dishes right in front of my spot at the bar. She said I'd have to wait a minute. 15 minutes later, she came back and asked again. The shaker usually fills the martini glass 3 or 4 times. In this case, it filled the glass halfway twice.  My suggestion is come is come for the food and maybe a beer, but sit at a table when it's busy, not the bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lubbock-7
Lena M.,"Houston, TX",51,2,,1.0,8/26/2017,"Worst Applebees experience ever , terrible service , dirty dishes , and disgusting drinks.

Lauren F.,"Lubbock, TX",208,1,,1.0,1/21/2017,This Applebee's cancelled a breakfast fundraiser for High Point Village 30 minutes before the event with no valuable excuse.

A B.,"Granbury, TX",1,5,,2.0,3/3/2017,"My husband finally gave in to me wanting to go to Applebee's, but to my dismay it started out as an absolute disaster! We ordered on line, that worked out well with a 15 minute wait, no problem there. When we arrived the Curbside To Go door was locked. My husband went back to the main door and was ignored for about 10 minutes even though there was only about 3 or 4 tables with customers and employees standing around.  He was told he would have to walk to the back of the restaurant to the to go area.  When he went back he was told, by an employee that didn't want to be working, that there were none of the appetizer that we ordered. He offered to get something else but by the time they were to be done the rest of the food would be cold. My husband declined, so they called the supervisor to fix the ticket. When we got home my husband's food was in the bottom of the bag because the lid wasn't secured properly. My food wasn't cooked properly, had to microwave the food to warm it up.  I called the restaurant because I was furious. The young lady that answered was very polite and paged the night manager to the phone. I explained what all was wrong.  He was very apologetic and understood why I was so upset. He helped get our problem solved even offering to fix us the appetizer the next day and call us when it was ready. He was the only good to come from our visit tonight.  I hope the appetizer turns out good tomorrow.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lubbock-7

Nathan H.,"Lubbock, TX",127,374,383,3.0,8/23/2012,"The best thing I can say about this American style restaurant is that it is very hit or miss, today it was a hit. I enjoy Applebee's but it is not reliable.  The Club House Grill is one of my favorite sandwiches on the menu, but every once in a while it is served cold.
