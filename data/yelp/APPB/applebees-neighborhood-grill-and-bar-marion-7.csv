Jaidan C.,"La Fontaine, IN",6,7,9,3.0,9/24/2017,"Me and my fiancé shared our plates. We had 3 all together. Lemon chicken with sweet vinaigrette and a side of rice , spicy chicken sandwich with coleslaw and pickles with  frys , and chicken with bacon and cheese with sides of mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. Food was somewhat delicious. But I do have to point out, the lemon chicken was super sweet ! Couldn't finish the sides. Even the rice had a certain flaw.  The plate wasn't brought together peacefully also the portion was off. I'd say the chicken was outstanding though ! We definitely wanted more! Next is the spicy chicken sandwich! It was served on a brioche bun which my taste buds had a blast going through that. The chicken was super crispy; makes my mouth water! It had a sauce that went heavenly with the coleslaw and pickles We devoured it! The fry's were perfect. Not soggy or too much/little salt. They were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Just how every fry should be. Last was the chicken with bacon, cheese, fried onions rings with the side of broccoli and mashed potatoes. I was actually hoping it would get better after the last plate. But it dramatically had gotten worst..  The chicken was dry and hard to cut through. I don't even want to discus the bacon,cheese, and onion rings.. It was disappointing to even look at. Bacon was soggy to the touch. The onion rings were so little I didn't even see any onions inside. And that cheese was just Awful! That whole plate was a disaster! The broccoli had no taste what so ever. And the mashed potatoes was more like a mixture of instant potatoes with lumpy prices cut from a raw potato. Come on!! Seriously ! You've wowed us with one plate .. another was okay. And then you dare serve us food from the bottom of a trash bag dug up from a dumpster! The waiter came which she didn't doing much anyways bothered asking us what our favorite dish was. We told her obviously what we thought. If I ever go back there , I might as well stick to the food I've already tried and loved. But seems like most of their food I can make at home myself but edible..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-marion-7
Dennis R.,"Gas City, IN",140,170,179,2.0,10/5/2013,"Sad. If its any indication, I clicked the ""nearby restaurants"" and Applebee's was the last option. Room was freezing. If we could only eat the pictures on the menu!!!  New Mac & Cheese & honey chicken was bland. My wife's steak was tough, then got cold because of the room temp.  On a positive note, the service was spot on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-marion-7
Robert Y.,"Ewa Beach, HI",2,3,,1.0,8/8/2015,"I've had Applebee's ribs before and they are not bad at all. This location managed to make a half rack look like it was from a small dog instead of a pig.  They also managed to give me intense diarrhea from my meal.  Not sure if it was the salad or the ribs, but there was something very odd about that cut of ribs at this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-marion-7
Lindsay B.,"Kokomo, IN",0,3,,3.0,8/29/2014,"Don't expect high end customer service - drinks will come slow and check ins will be few. Great servers are at a minimum. Greeter was mildly friendly. General manger just walked around and never came by to check in even though we were with a large group. Positively, the food is what would be expected from a chain - atypical and nothing that will wow, however will satiate your hunger. Further, if you prefer to do some people watching, I recommended the tables by the front windows. It's really dinner and show.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-marion-7

Zach G.,"Kalamazoo, MI",14,72,3,4.0,3/15/2014,"If there's one thing Marion has goin for itself, at least it has an Applebee's.  But seriously I really do like this place and the waiters are great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-marion-7
