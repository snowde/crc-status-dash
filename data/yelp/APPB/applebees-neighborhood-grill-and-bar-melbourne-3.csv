Anthony S.,"Melbourne, FL",120,1,,1.0,8/5/2016,"I have been here many times. This time was worse than  most. Never refilled my drink. Almost no bread in the French Onion soup, my steak was ordered as a mediumrare 12oz and was 6oz blue when delivered I sent it back it came back still rare....Half of it didn't cook away. My fiance ordered the Southwestern Steak salad and it was so grizzly she couldn't chew it. the tortilla strips were stale and there was a hair in it. and at some point the bartender screamed holy shit look who it is when a former employee walked in. I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-melbourne-3?start=20
Deborah S.,"Melbourne, FL",6,7,,2.0,11/12/2016,"I am not trying to be ungrateful but my husband & I went yesterday to Applebee's for the free Veterans Day meal and the entrée with the steak mashed potatoes and onion rings was very good and again, I hate to be ungrateful but I really thought it might come with something like a salad and some bread but it did not, just an entrée. I asked did it come with rolls and she said no but would find out if I could have some and she did bring 2 out. When we got the bill I noticed that the 2 ice teas were $2.59 each and I was charged $1.00 for the rolls. I think the dinner should have come with a drink unless you were getting a drink with alcohol in it and really, charging for 2 rolls? That is a slap in the face for veterans that served our country.  Well, next time we will just go to Golden Coral because you get all you want to eat, salad, entrees, rolls, desert & a drink for free.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-melbourne-3?start=20
Charlene H.,"Indialantic, FL",58,24,310,2.0,1/1/2016,"We asked to be seated in the bar area so we could watch tv. Shortly afterward the bartender (a muscular bald guy who will remain nameless) hurried over and we ordered two waters. To which he replied ""jeez the last three tables ordered water"" and ran off to retrieve them. Sorry for ordering water I guess. He was rushing around and every time he came to our table he acted like we were interrupting. We both ordered the triple bacon cheeseburger which were delicious but the bartender said they all came with lettuce and tomato which they did not. His overall attitude was abrupt and inconvenienced which made our experience slightly uncomfortable. Like I said the burgers were great but we spent $24.99 on 2 bacon burgers and fries. (Onion rings substituted for $1.49). Not including tip. And you wonder why we ordered water? Lucky for him I was generous and left a $5 tip anyway. Kill em with kindness and maybe it will rub off for the next customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-melbourne-3?start=20

My server, Ivory, was not only courteous and knowledgeable, she was FAST. Even though she was handling several other tables during my visit, she took the time to recognize EXACTLY what I was wanting to eat and it was delivered so quickly that it might have been a ""fast food"" restaurant....or faster!

Crystal B.,"Wilson, NC",83,2,2,1.0,6/27/2013,"If I could give this establishment half a star I would. We waited roughly 10-15 mins before our waiter showed up to take our drink order. There were four of us. My bf, his mother, our son and myself. I got my apple sangria before my son received his apple tree juice box.  We ordered the spinach artichoke dip as an appetizer, on the menu it says it also comes with a chipotle salsa, when we asked where it was our wait was amazed it was on the menu Witt he artichoke dip and said he would talk to his manager. We never saw the salsa.  We all ordered our dinners and proceeded to wait for our food. Our waiter came by about 30ish mins after we ordered and was surprised we hadn't been served our food yet. (He was our waiter...why would anyone else serve us our food when we were his table?!?!)  So 15 mins after that he came with our food. My bf ordered the Signature sirloin w/Garlic Herb Shrimp. He got a 7 oz oddly shaped piece of steak with pilaf rice. We asked where the shrimp was and he said that it wasn't what we ordered, but if we'd like shrimp he could order it from the kitchen. We told him never mind and proceeded to start eating. When I finally focused on my meal, I ordered the take two seasonal menu: 4oz Blackened Sirloin and Garlic Rosemary Chicken Pasta. The Sirloin wasn't bad, the roasted potatoes on the other hand were over cooked and splattered with some odd paste. The Garlic Rosemary Chicken Pasta...PASS!!! Did not taste a bit like Garlic or Rosemary...it was dried chicken, a few lemon tasting artichokes and two very small pieces of portobello mushroom on drained, barely cooked correctly pasta. Pasta that was mostly stuck to itself.  When the manager came around and asked how our meal was I said it was ok...she wanted to know what was just ok. I explained my meal...which by the way also came without my bread that the menu said was included. She did comp me my meal and offered free desert...we didn't want to order any desert and then become disappointed with that.  Our waiter brought us our receipt and also proceeded to chastise us about coming to him if there were any issues with our meal. We grudgingly gave him a tip...mostly because I was once a waiter and know that you mostly live off your tips. I did want to pull him aside and explain if he would have corrected his first two mistakes (salsa with dip and missing shrimp) we wouldn't have complained to his manager about my meal...but whatever. NEVER GOING THERE AGAIN!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-melbourne-3?start=20

I went twice- once for a burger and once for half price apps. Both times the servers were friendly, and the food was very good. You can't beat the specials on their apps and drinks either.

Josh M.,"Manhattan, NY",541,532,2449,3.0,7/27/2017,This is my first time at this location. After my flight I wanted to grab some dinner not fast food. So I decided to order TO GO from my car. Well...  the website says there open until 1am. The TO GO closed at 10pm. So I went inside the location. Which always packed at 11pm on a Thursday night.  I went inside and the girl said I could order car side to go at the bar. Wow. Ok. BTW. They have a full blown karaoke going on inside. It was sooo loud. I had trouble herring the bartender taking my order. I order my food. Took a long time. I couldent believe how many people were here doing karaoke at 11:30pm. Do these people Work the next day. Ooh well.  The food was ok. It was normal for Applebee's.  What you would expect at 11pm at night  Overall. Past 11pm in the area there aren't many options. A lot of places close. Even fast food. This was my. best bet. There were a lot of locals inside,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-melbourne-3

Jan-Michael T.,"Palm Bay, FL",47,104,895,2.0,2/27/2017,"Long ago in a time not so far away during a time way before Yelp reviews, Applebee's used to have a menu that was delicious. I would frequent my local restaurant because everything they had was delicious. Oh how I wish those days would return. Until then, I will grace them with my disdain in this review. The location found guilty of serving my friends and I abominations of food is located in Eau Gallie, the southwest quadrant of the Eau Gallie Boulevard and Wickham Road intersection. If it helps, it is right in front of a shopping strip consisting of an Old Time Pottery, Tijuana Flats, Moon's Seafood, and Anytime Fitness. First and foremost, I will say the decor and style of Applebee's is dated, but nothing horrendous. It hasn't improved in like over a decade, but to be frank, it doesn't need to. Where Applebee's needs a shot of adrenaline in hopes of resuscitation is their menu. With the rise of fast casual restaurants like Chipotle's and Panera Bread Company, traditional sit-down restaurants started to suffer. In order to keep up with these new millennial-fueled establishments, said traditional sit-down restaurants did everything they could to get butts in their chairs including theme nights and revamping their menu. Applebee's changed the menu but it wasn't a revamp. For example, they have a chicken and macaroni and cheese plate. The combination usually works as proven by Wawa, but Applebee's tried to be unique by mixing traditional american cheese macaroni and topping it off with sweet and sour chicken. the combo does not fit. Let's not get started on the cooking staff. I am not attacking their character for they may be good people in life, but the food they prepare is atrocious especially when food is not cooked to order. Even when food is cooked right to the recipe, they are getting the blunt or rejection because the recipe is a disaster. As for the host and wait staff, I feel really sorry for them because many are real nice and accommodating, but they can only push such food to an extent. Ultimately, my advice is to avoid Applebee's as much as you can. There are other sit-down traditional restaurants that are doing a better job keeping up with the fast casual restaurants (like Chili's and Carrabba's Italian Grill). Let's hope that Applebee's can save itself before it becomes a figment of people's memories like Bennigan's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-melbourne-3
Anthony M.,"Palm Bay, FL",1,5,1,4.0,8/12/2017,"Greeted and welcomed into Applebee's. Service was very nice and really fast with my drinks. Ordered appetizers, was on the table within 5 min. Definitely was hot and fresh, and then was thinking of two orders to choose from and they helped me decide. Very polite, very clean and enjoyed the music while waiting for my food. My entrée was here in about 8 min, fresh and very good looking. Lunch time wasn't expecting the wait time to be short, food time short, and from my view point it's awesome they had everything in control.

Tim G.,"Satellite Beach, FL",0,11,4,2.0,10/29/2017,Stopped for a quick cheeseburger and brew.  Six beers on tap but no IPA and only one IPA in the bottle. Oh well. Ordered Bourbon St. chicken and shrimp b/c a friend said it was good. Should have gotten the cheeseburger. Food and service was fast but entree was very very disappointing. Small thin breast under seasoned and over cooked. Shrimp was from freezer to plate. Potatoes ranged from slivers to diced to chunked so some were over crispy while others were tough. I didn't even know the grilled onions were supposed to have mushrooms until I found one sliver of a shroom on the plate. Major disappointment. Sadly...it met my expectations.  I'll drive by next time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-melbourne-3

Bradford P.,"Satellite Beach, FL",0,20,34,1.0,8/21/2016,The menu is horrible now. Asian Stir Fry dishes? Really? Had a sirloin steak and it was like chewing a rubber ball. So tough and not even cooked through. Prices have gone up alot. There is no value anymore  $10.29 for boneless wings? Really? Sorry to say we are scratching this place off our list.

Pretty sure that's illegal in Florida...pointed it out to the To Go gal and she just giggled then handed me my bill. Got home with the salad and soup   do the soup in about a 3 oz. thimble.

Momma S.,"Melbourne, FL",0,3,,2.0,11/13/2017,"Ordered car to go for our favorite entrees oriental chicken salad and quesadilla burger after a long day of travel. I upgraded the fries (+$1.49)to onion rings and got a blonde brownie for a shared dessert. The main mistake was sending hubby to pick it up as we both know they'll mess up orders while you're sitting there much less a wrapped up take out order. The order had regular fries,no onion rings, a wasted $1.49. The chicken salad was grilled instead of fried and the burger was missing the tomatoes and pickles added to the detailed takeout menu. Last but not least the brownie came plain with no caramel sauce and a tiny sliver of ice cream in a takeout container.

Kayla B.,"Ames, IA",54,469,2509,2.0,11/27/2015,"This was an interesting Applebees experience. I really enjoy Applebees purely for the fact that the food is usually pretty standard and unvaried. I don't worry about the recipe tasting different from location to location. Unfortunately, today's experience didn't meet that expectation. I think this is the first time that I've been actually and genuinely disappointed in my Three-Cheese Chicken Penne pasta dish. It was extremely, extremely dry with virtually no sauce on it. The meet was burned. It was pretty bad. Sunday nights from 10pm to 2am are karaoke night. This, in itself, isn't an issue. Unfortunately, we spent the hour's time we were here listening to old country songs being sung by drunk people. Country song after country song. I'm cool with karaoke, but I just don't need quite so much country. We saw our server twice. On the bright side, the other staff made up for it. It's sorta like we were being waited on by the entire staff of the restaurant. We interacted with 5 different people during our stay - people checking in for drinks, or taking orders, or bringing checks. It was neat because otherwise I think we wouldn't have had any service, but it was frustrating because we had to keep repeating or clarifying what had already been done. It's an Applebees, but it's not nearly what I normally expect from my Applebees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-melbourne-3
Sarah C.,"Haverhill, MA",119,6,,2.0,10/30/2017,"Just had a very weird experience here with my family... So we walk in and there's empty tables and bar seats everywhere, and the hostess says it's going to be a 10 minute wait I can't seat you til after 7 (it was 6:56). And we're like okay if we can't get a table can we sit at he bar? And she's like no the bartender is overwhelmed right now. And we're like there's like 10 open seats. And she's like I can't sit you. Then the manager comes over and is like the kitchen is crashing we can't seat you. So if you wait here for 10 minutes then when you sit t will take 30 minutes to get your food but if you sit down now it'll take an hour. And we're like... so why can't we just sit at the bar or a table and have a drink for 10 minutes instead of sitting in the lobby when there's legit so many open tables. It was so weird, like we're going to wait the same amount of time for food either way so why can't we sit down and have a drink... it was so weird",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-melbourne-3

I wasn't happy with it at all went back in I seen the manager  and ask him where's my rice he looked and said looked fine to him, really he said everything was proportions so he knew it was right, I told him it was sad to spend 40.00 dollars on two meals and one drink and tip and that was all I get !!!

I ordered the grill-seared watermelon with shrimp salad and ON THE MENU IT TELLS YOU WHAT DRINK PAIRS WELL.... So, I ordered it too! The drink order was so frustrating I literally almost left. I noticed that the bartender (female) was not making drinks for the servers - just standing there helping the 2 patrons sitting at the bar. So, I remind my server (again) that I STILL haven't gotten my drink and AGAIN when my food arrived and AGAIN when I was almost finished with my food. She finally admitted that the bartender didn't know how to make it and they were looking for the recipe book - really? Because I looked over and she was not looking for any recipe book. FINALLY my server went over and the two of them were trying to figure out how to make my drink. My friend ordered the Triple Hog sandwich and fries... easy enough BUT, he never got his fries. He mentioned it and she said ""they were not to my liking so I had them remake them"" FINALLY, he is almost done with his sandwich and a small bowl of fries is dropped off. About 5 minutes later ANOTHER ""server"" (manager I think?) brings a bowl of fries with twice as many as what he actually got... she sees he has french fries so she takes the bigger bowl away.  We are now BOTH annoyed and we just wanted to leave so we asked for our check and of course THAT comes quickly. ZERO discount for giving us our drink and french fries when we were almost done with our food. I want to point out that this was such a bummer because the food is decent and the place is close to my house I I'd have been a regular but the service is so slow it will be a long time before I am back -",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-melbourne-3
