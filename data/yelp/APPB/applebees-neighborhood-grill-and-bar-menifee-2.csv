R.Scott H.,"Canyon Lake, CA",84,140,211,4.0,4/4/2016,We went to Applebee's for happy hour and sat in the bar. We had margaritas that were decently priced and pretty good. We also had the won ton tacos that were dang good. We also had the chicken wings and chips and spinach dip. The spinach dip tasted like it was frozen and warmed up but was just ok. The service on the other hand was spot on and management was more than accommodating . We will return to try some of the other bar fare,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-menifee-2?start=20

Poor management.  I really do like to Yelp about chain restaurants...They are what they are food wise.  As far as customer service goes, some are better than others.  This particular ""Crapplebees"" is one of the bad ones.  My wife likes one of the salads they have here...

Oscar T.,"Vista, CA",0,3,,1.0,9/9/2017,"This is my favorite restaurant to go out with my family and friends, sadly though I came to this Applebee's with my family. The service their was  quick, the waitress was kind and got seated in a clean booth. My brother ordered a whiskey burger and the burger was just ridiculous. The burger beef was too big for the bun and as soon he started eating it, it started to fall apart. I ordered chicken tenders from the $20 deal menu where you order some food and get a free entree. (That whiskey burger is also in the $20 deal.) As we were done eating, my brother had to use the restroom and I had just finished eating me meal. My brother came back from the bathroom and told me that he had puked in the bathroom. He told me that he thinks it was the burger because he felt really nauseous after taking four bites. As I finished, I too felt nauseous after eating. I was really disappointed with the food, the service was great but the food was terrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-menifee-2?start=20

Pablo H.,"Temecula, CA",142,2,2,1.0,11/22/2016,"Honestly doesn't even deserve one star, I don't normally do this but my family and I had by far the worst experience here. I've never had an experience like this in my life We arrived at this location a little after 8pm. Jeff was our waiter. My wife and I ordered drinks for ourselves and tea for our two kids. Also ordered a combo appetizer. Roughly thirty minutes go by before we address our waiter that we are ready to order (we had to ask in between ordering a second set of refills for our kids because he did not ask us if we were ready to order) We finally receive our appetizer along with a third round of refills. Two hours go by and we ask the hostess where our waiter is because we still haven't gotten our food, finally our waiter comes by and asks how we are doing. We tell him we've been here for two and a half hours and have not received our food. He says he's going to check.  Now I'm not one for walking out without paying but with refills and a appetizer spent over sixty dollars that's just insane! And still left with no food!! I'm not blaming our waiter or even the cooks but management for not taking initiative and training their employees properly. Along with this review I will also be filing a formal complaint to corporate!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-menifee-2?start=20
Cindy W.,"Carlsbad, CA",2235,1958,4356,4.0,9/14/2014,"Another business added to this city, can't say it's a bad thing that they're bringing business and jobs to Menifee. Opens at 11:00 am, you can come here for brunch, lunch or dinner.  We wanted to support the place even though we've been to an AppleBees before and pretty much know what the food is like.  I was impressed though, I must say, that while we were waiting to be seated, they were offering everyone frozen strawberry lemonades and even seconds if you wanted some. The hostess was very friendly with my kids and she seemed like she enjoys being at work, something you want to see in a host.  We got seated and realized the place isn't that big at all, but the ambiance of dedication to Menifee was very interesting and kind of cool. They had these computer pads at the table for you to look at the menu, play games (for $0.99), reorder your drinks or even pay your bill. Nice touch, Applebees!  Our waiter was Jimmy, he was nice and knowledgeable of the menu but clearly was nervous, that was fine with me. Still great service! He made sure to put in our entree order a few minutes after putting in our appetizer so that we would have time to eat our appetizer. Which we got the honey barbeque bone-in wings, not bad, but not great either. Maybe we should have went with the buffalo wings instead.  For drinks, I got the frozen strawberry lemonade because it was so hot outside and it was that good, I had to order it. My husband got the blue agave margarita and that wasn't too bad, not strong though.  For my entree, I got the margarita queso chicken and shrimp, very good, but the chicken was a bit dry and the shrimp was cold. Hence why i took a star off. My husband ordered the 7-oz sirloin with mashed potatoes and vegetables, it was good. My daughter got the corn dog and applesauce packet to share with her sister.  Food wasn't spectacular or anything but it wasn't bad either. Service made up for it and I really like the ambiance in there. Good going, Applebees!

They do seem to always be busy which bodes well for them but not for speed of service. Really, my only problem is parking. The parking lot is so tiny for the amount of businesses there.

Wendy W.,"Sun City, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/9/2016,"This was truly the worst service I've had in a really long time. I sat there for an eternity waiting for someone to even acknowledge me, and when my order was finally taken and I got served, neither my waitress nor any other server ever came by to check on me. I had planned to order (at least) another drink, some bread to eat with my meal and a meal to go, but I was so mad by the time she finally asked if I wanted anything else (after sitting there with an empty glass and my plate pushed away for, again, a ridiculously long time), I just wanted out of there. I asked for a comment card and she said they don't have any. I've been to other Applebee's and have always been treated well. I won't be coming back to this one,  though. P.S. I overheard the table next to me complaining to the manager when I sat down, so I don't think it's just me.  : (",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-menifee-2?start=20
Abigail C.,"Anaheim, CA",329,158,131,2.0,10/11/2015,"They had a promo up that said they have a new drink: the Mango Margarita.  If the server does not offer it, then you get a free appetizer on your next visit.  At the end of our meal, our server still had not offered it so when we got our receipt, we asked for the free appetizer. She looked at us like a deer in the headlights, then started explaining that they had a new drink. Afterwards, she just looked at us and asked if we wanted to order one. We were like no our meal is done... is this you offering? We would like our free appetizer please! She then looked at us irritated and went to get the manager to give us our free appetizer voucher.... Awkward!!!! Applebees is mediocre food.  Their prices are decent but the food is nothing special. This location is fairly new so the interior is nice but the service usually sucks.  They usually serve the regulars well (and it really shows) and everyone else usually gets put on the back burner.    Many other restaurants within a mile (In n Out or Red Robin if you want a burger, Texas roadhouse for ribs and steak, BJ'S brewery for cocktails, beer and appetizers) so I would recommend going elsewhere!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-menifee-2?start=20

Luis P.,"Temecula, CA",8,252,20,4.0,4/13/2017,"After visiting, and enduring, and finally regretting several mediocre franchises, I must say our outing as a family to our local Applebee's was a rather pleasant one. From the service, by the very capable Brittney, to the food from the 2 for $20 menu, everyone was at the very least, content. Even the wallet. After reading several bad reviews, I was singing the song from the Clash: ""Should I stay, or should I go?"" Well, happy we all went. Place was busy at around 7:30 PM, and everyone seemed to be enjoying the time. Food from the limited, but none the less, very acceptable menu was certainly good enough for our hungry crowd. Even though we were only 5, we ordered 3 of the 2 for $20, so some food returned home with us for a later midnight snack! Only water was asked for, and even that was nicely delivered with Brittany's friendly smile. The bill came out to around $67.41?, which was kind of enigmatic, and had me trying to decipher the actual tax being charged, but now a days there are so many surcharges that I simply took it with a grain of salt. 17% was given to our server, surely deserved, and we walked away $74+ less. Is Applebee's on the rebound? 4 Stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-menifee-2?start=20
Erin R.,"Corona, CA",0,13,,1.0,12/27/2016,"I usually enjoy Applebee's, especially the wonton tacos which are my favorite. However, this is the WORST Applebee's there is. The service is terrible, and the food is not cooked properly or with any care for the customer what so ever. We tried to go there twice in one week and both times left angry.  The first time we were seated fairly quickly, but then we just sat there unattended for 15 minutes. At no point did we see a waiter, and certainly I wasn't going to continue to wait around with my 3 children while no one cared about our business for their restaurant. We walked out without ever taking even a drink order. So another few days go by and I really wanted the wonton tacos and they have a burger special on Mondays, so we decided to give them one more shot. There was a 20 minute wait, with half the restaurants tables empty (This is obviously a staffing problem they need to fix). Then we finally get seated only to wait and wait and wait. After 20+ minutes I saw a table seated after us take their order, and that was the last straw. I talked to the manager and he sent over a waitress to take our order. After placing our order she was nice enough to give us free chips and salsa for waiting, however the food took an astronomical amount of time to receive. We ordered 3 appetizers, and a burger yet it took well over 30 minutes to receive them. Once we did receive the food the boneless wings had Asian zing sauce instead of honey bbq and luckily I thought it looked weird and tasted if before I gave it to my 6 year old!! She cant handle the heat, and I would have gone through the roof with anger. They exchanged those for honey bbq after a little bit of a wait, and then the shrimp was cold and OLD but that never seemed to come back out ever again. Nothing we ordered came out right besides the burger. Everything took forever, and I can guarantee we will not go back. Next time I want applebees I will gladly travel to another city to eat there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-menifee-2?start=40

(would of been shorter had he came to serve us. 1- take drink order, 2-order and I ordered a lemonade at this point but never got it , he even said if he has time he'll bring it over. The restaurant was not busy (7pm dinner). 3 check back 10 mins after food arrived and only 4th time bc we ordered our desert off the table console since he never came back. We were out of drinks had to ask another server to get it. Had to ask the bar for extra spoons we already asked for. 3/4 of our food was cold (cold enough to give it straight to my 1.5 year old). The hot one was on the skillet. My mac and cheese was dried out on the sides. The manager visited the tables around us but not us. After there were hardly any people inside and the server and manager were stating they were getting fresher beef for the ribs and how they just got it in.

It's all bar food so it doesn't take long to cook, and we weren't there at a really busy time so there really was no reason for everything to take so long to come out. Our waitress was nice enough about it but just didn't seem to really care much.  Was unimpressed with the shrimp salad I got, maybe seafood just isn't Applebees thing because I do usually get something simpler like a burger.

We added extra shrimp to the other meal and received about 5 total, so how many came with the dinner? 2? Then the chocolate dessert they initially forgot to bring us at car-side to go, came with ""hot fudge"" turns out it was BBQ sauce and ruined the dessert because you couldn't tell from how dark it was and thinking it's meant for your food we just poured it on top. When we called to complain the Manager had the nerve to tell us to call back tomorrow and they will see if they can do something for us. Unbelievable. What's the Manager hired at this location for?

When the server took our order I was surprised that my over priced entree did not come with a soup or salad.  It was an add-on. I ordered 3 kids meals for my daughters it was pizza bites and yogurt. The pizza was actually 2 half slices of garlic bread with way too much tomato sauce and cheese sprinkled on top. My kids only ate their yogurt and did not touch their ""pizza"".  My son and husband ordered burgers and they were not impressed.

That's a neat trick that I could teach you but I'm a better person than to do that to my guests. Veggies were thrown into boiling water for 30 secs and served..hard...and raw. Chicken was cold and my roommates supposed ""medium"" steak was not medium. Only reason we both stayed and not complained is we had not eaten all day and were in no mood to wait another 40 mins for fresh food and then worry about what the dishwasher/cook did to our food once he/she heard we complained. After throwing our money on the counter hinting we wanted a fast exit..it took the 2 ""trying to look busier than they actually were"" bartender/waitresses about another 15 mins to finally cash us out.

Stephanie R.,"Sun City, CA",0,7,,1.0,6/22/2015,"Applebees has sure gone downhill.  We thought we would try the new Applebees in our area and give them one more try.  It was AWFUL, the food, the service.  There were several servers and even when we went early to miss the crowd we still had bad service. We had to wait and ask several different times and different people for extra napkins and even for our check.   Their old menu seemed to have better choices it used to be my favorite restaurant. On this visit I ordered the mac & cheese with chicken and it was so sweet I couldn't eat it and left most of it.  It was like they poured too much sauce and it overpowered everything else.  They might do better at happy hour for drinks and appetizers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-menifee-2?start=120
Jameela A.,"Menifee, CA",0,4,,1.0,5/16/2015,"Came into Applebee's on my BIRTHDAY expecting to get a drink and appetizers before I hit the bar however Natalie and Leslie ruined that for me!!!!! I waited over 10 minutes before even being acknowledged by Natalie and once I did she asked if we had been helped. We said no and she said that sucks let me get someone and walked away. This is not the first time me and my friend have dealt with Natalie and her rude remark therefore we decided to leave. As we we're leaving we walked back to get her name and another waitress who was laughing at the matter, and we're told ""make sure you spell my name right "". Meaning this review!!!! They have forced us to not come back and to spread the word about the horrible service that goes on at this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-menifee-2?start=120
Marjie T.,"Menifee, CA",0,45,,3.0,10/18/2014,"In to the bar tonight for a quick bite.  It was very crowded and we weren't in the mood to stand around and wait.  Made friends with the bartender and our wine and beer were good.  We are headed to Outback tomorrow night so no red meat.  We both ended up with entree salads.  A Thai shrimp salad and a chicken Caesar. I didn't care for the chicken, it was dry and salty.  The dressing was no where close to tasting like what caesar is supposed to taste like.  More like a tangy ranch.  Disappointing.  Husband was fine with Thai shrimp salad.  We will go back and explore the menu further.  Caesar is my favorite salad, hope I can get past that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-menifee-2?start=120
Michael P.,"Riverside, CA",0,41,10,2.0,12/12/2014,"Sorry for the 2 stars however I don't know how to put 1 1/2 stars? This is our 3rd time here since the opening, the first time there were a few mistakes which we figured was because they were brand new, the second time not only were our meals wrong but when I sent mine back it took forever to come back and was still wrong. The party of 3  that sat behind us on the second time, their whole order was incorrect and one of them never got the entree ? The waitress kept offering them appetizers in place of their food, good thing they got a free desert !! We thought we would give it another try tonight , and once again one of our meals was totally wrong. During our meal we heard numerous tables complain about their orders ? My wife had a margarita and it came in a mixed drink glass (tall & skinny ) and was way under par, I ordered iced tea and I had to continually asked for refills ? You couldn't have ordered a easier entree then mine to make and it was so wrong that I changed to something different. I settled for the (new)  peppered shrimp and broccoli pasta plate , OH NO ! Never again! Seriously the junior Master Chefs on TV. ( 8-12) year olds would have given more flavor then that. I find it hard to believe that the chefs or the person that expedites taste the food prior to leaving the kitchen. Just so everyone knows we are big fans of Applebee's just not this one. Hey chefs learn how to blacken shrimp, it's not just covering them in chili powder !! Merry Christmas......",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-menifee-2?start=120
Jill W.,"SUN CITY, CA",69,11,10,1.0,10/5/2015,Very upsetting. All servers kept saying they were new. It took a hour and half for my friends food and my food came 15 minutes later even after I cancelled it. The server was very polite. Informed us it was his first nite with no training. Really Applebee s menifee mgmt get together!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-menifee-2?start=120
Rogelio B.,"San Jacinto, CA",0,9,,5.0,11/30/2014,Leslie is the best bartender. Simple as that. Always come back and feel treated like a friend. Thanks Leslie!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-menifee-2?start=120
Taylor H.,"Temecula, CA",13,17,3,1.0,1/1/2015,"My family and I went there tonight; my mom was really looking forward to enjoying a nice meal at the new Applebee's!!! Unfortunately, the dining experience was not great. The food was mediocre at best, and the service was just terrible. I believe our waiter was overbooked with tables, but that didn't overrule the neglect of service we received. He wasn't very attentive at all, and my brothers girlfriends meal was left in the back while we were all waiting for it, so we could eat.I highly recommend going to a different Applebee's if this is the restaurant of your choice.   Also to add, my brother accidentally left his phone at the table when we were done, he came back twice and even spoke to the manager to find it. The manager seems very bothered and did not care to be honest, finally after the third time going back to the table a busser found the phone under the table.This one desperately needs a turnaround, it's sad because it's brand new.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-menifee-2?start=120
Keith H.,"Battle Creek, MI",0,9,6,5.0,11/11/2014,Great service my waiter was Joshua and he was outstanding. I also noticed the manager Moses was going out of his way to ensure everyone had great service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-menifee-2?start=120
