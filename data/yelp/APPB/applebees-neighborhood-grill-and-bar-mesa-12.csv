Gillian C.,"Gilbert, AZ",92,108,285,4.0,10/25/2017,"We were seated within 5 minutes, just in time to order 1/2 price appetizers.   For some reason, our table didn't  have the ""pay at your table""/Game-play things.  I asked for one and they quickly complied.  (I hate waiting/paying for a check.)  They dropped it off and informed us there is a charge to play the games (I knew this already as I like to play the quizes-obviously i dont know my spouse very well....i always guess the wrong thing, BAHAWAAA) We ordered the appetizer combo-Happy Hour 50% off.  It was 5:45pm.  Correct price on the check (yippy)and Totally delicious.  They even brought the correct bleu cheese dip. So many places get that wrong but not here. We ordered the 2/$20 whiskey burger with fries.  My husband thought the meat needed more seasoning.  I took a bite and I thought the combination of the whiskey bbq steak sauce, crunchy onions, bacon, and cheese was incredible.  With all the mixture of flabors, the meat doesn't need a great deal of extra ""umph.""  Ehat I liked about the burger was the little bit of ""crisp"" surrounding the meat pattie As for my meal.  The chicken with white sauce covered with crunchy onions, baked tator and i got a ""premium"" side of bacon mac-n- cheese (at an extra charge.)  I think I like the mac-n-cheese the best.  Very cheesy with a creamy sauce, add in the cruch of the bacon-home run.  As for the chicken....not sure how they managed it but it was both rubbery and moist.  I took most of it home for leftovers.  ""Lunch tomorrow!""  Not sure if for me or my dog....depends how good it is.  But hey, the dog eats anything...including my shoes and hair brush. :) The waiter we had was awesome.  Did everything right.  Checked on us often but not too often to be a pest.  Was friendly without being flirty.  Sometimes Im in the mood to be ""chatty"" but tonight we were in a hurry.  It was time to bowl so he quickly brought boxes.  As he was bagging up the meal, I was paying for the meal.  Multi-tasking.....I love it.   Overall, 4 stars.  Only due to the rubbery chicken.  No real complaints and we had a wonderful meal.  Will go again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-12
Bailey C.,"Mesa, AZ",65,17,,1.0,1/7/2018,"OH WOW!! THIS WAS THE MOST HORRIBLE AND INSULTING EXPERIENCE!!!! I chose this location to have a family lunch to send off my daughter back to school. I was sooo excited for the all you can eat riblets. I'm not even going to talk about horrible our server was, his name was Christopher.  The manager had to fill out refills because Christopher was nowhere to be seen, and this is a small store. It took 25 min to get our food,  they did bring us chips and salsa. But there were no plates and napkins. My God I'm ranting!! I ordered the ribs naked with sauce on the side and they arrived fully sauced. I explained that they were supposed to be naked and sauce in side. My family ate all of their food and I still didn't get my plate. After 40 min. a kid showed up, but come on, no thank you send them back. The manager didn't even come by to speak to us. Christopher wasn't even aware I sent the food back when I asked him to remove the item from my bill. I told him that this was a horrible experience, he shrugged it off. Server came back and informed me that the manager removed the ribs from the bill. But no manager came to visit the table, guy sucks at his job. But, I was given a to go box with 4 ribs,  How Effin insulting,  I went in for all you can eat, and their solution was to give me a box of cold ribs.  WHAT IS WRONG WITH APPLEBEES!!! NO STARS!!!! I spent $70 and didn't eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-12

We got: 2 American classic's, a brunch burger, and chicken cavatopi pasta. First thing that was wrong was that I ordered the American classic with nothing but cheese,bacon, and pickles. It came with secret sauce on it. Next they forgot the chicken cavatopi. We waited for a while and had to remind them.

Courtney M.,"Queen Creek, AZ",207,177,352,3.0,10/4/2017,"I was never a big Applebee's fan but when I was younger my mother and I would always go to the Farmingdale multiplex to watch scary movies with her co-workers and then eat at the Applebee's right there so it holds a special place in my heart. However, I only ever went for 2-fer's or  1/2 price apps after 10pm after that and was never really satisfied with their food so I abandoned Applebee's for TGIF. Well, TGIF's are few and far between in Arizona (there's literally two) and for some reason, a lot of places I hated on the east coast are WAY better on the west coast so I decided to give Applebee's another chance. My husband and I had been going to one closer to my mouse and I loved that one, no complaints, so when we spotted this location the other day while driving around, we gladly stopped in. This Applebee's is a little run-down. Our table was a little sticky and the leather seating had a big cut down the middle which irritated my legs. Our waiter was really friendly though, I told my husband he looked like an old-time Cowboy movie star and based on this piece of info alone, if you ever go to this location, you'll know exactly who I'm talking about, lol. My husband ordered the boneless wing appetizer as an entrée and I ordered the smallest sirloin they had with a size of fries (to give my husband) and a side of bacon macaroni and cheese.  Our food took a while to come out, especially for a Saturday afternoon when the restaurant wasn't particular busy, but we just played some games on the table kiosk so no big deal. I ordered my steak medium and it came out well down with some char around the edges. I wasn't going to say anything but I decided to just mention it to waiter since usually they stay around and have you cut into your steak to check the cook on it. He asked if I wanted to send it back which I declined because it had taken quite a while and then asked if I wanted to take a brand new one home. I accepted his order and he actually had the kitchen remake my entire order so I got a meal to take home. I was super surprised that he did that since I ate my macaroni and my husband and I devoured those fries.  He even had me cut into my steak before he bagged it up for me to take home. My husband said his wings were so-so and commented that he preferred the other Applebee's better which I do too but the service at this Applebee's is great. The manager came around to check on us as well as she was apologetic about the steak. Overall, we probably won't be back to this location because it's so out of our way but even though my first steak was off, they went above and beyond to fix the mistake and the service was excellent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-12

Leslie B.,"Chandler, AZ",50,158,356,4.0,5/22/2016,"Clean restaurant , friendly staff , food was decent , prices are very affordable .. Especially if you can hit them up at happy hour ! We split an order of onion rings (best part of the dinner )  I had the 6 inch steak, garlic mashed potatoes & broccoli . Steak was ok, mashed potatoes were great !! And broccoli was steamed and tasted like broccoli !? Lol.. Reuben had the baby back ribs with fries and broccoli . He said it was good , not fantastic but he ate the whole thing.

Christine L.,"Chandler, AZ",52,157,17,4.0,9/2/2017,"Although I just ordered water and an appetizer, I can't say much about this place food wise. Our server was very nice and fast too. We came in for lunch and was about in about 30 minutes. The hostess greeted us at the door with a smiling face. The appetizer that we ordered were pretzels and it was pretty good. Came with 4 long sticks and there were 2 dipping sauce which was honey mustard and their beer cheese. My favorite was the honey mustard. The beer cheese was alright, a bit on the salty side.

Sue C.,"Tempe, AZ",95,566,,4.0,9/30/2016,"Applebee's just underwent a major revamp of the menu so I thought this would be a good time to update my review. The current effort seems to be to transform Applebee's into a steak house along the lines of Outback Steakhouse. They have a rack with hunks of wood and a sign touting the Wood Fired Grill items in the entry and steak knives that look identical to the Outback Steakhouse.  I had seen an ad on TV for their wood grilled sirloin steak plus two sides for just $9.99 for a limited time (it will be $12.99 after the initial promo). I had a tasty 6 ounce sirloin steak grilled just the way I like it and garlic mashed potatoes, and broccoli. All the food was very good and the steak was even tender. Service was friendly and snappy.  Overall, the meal was a great value. I just question whether the Valley needs yet another steakhouse chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-12
Chris L.,"Mesa, AZ",0,21,4,4.0,6/3/2017,Went here for lunch on a date.  Had the steak soup and new spicy wrap. There was no food descriptions but our waitress made sure to define everything for us.  Once I received the soup it was great. The taste was spicy and zesty (going perfect with the new wrap).  We were both very cold. I would suggest turning the AC to around 75-78. Felt around 65-70.

Splatter P.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,3,1,1.0,3/30/2017,"Bland American traditional with a healthy side of apathy! Went in at 11PM on a Wednesday to kill some time, and killed it was. Less than 10 tables with guests, and a few at the bar, but we waited almost 10 minutes for a server to notice and find us a table.  But it got better. Appetizer arrived with no plates or silverware. We asked for some. Then entres arrived, still no silverware. We asked about silverware again. The server rolled her eyes, then stopped at 2 tables to take orders before finally dumping 2 forks for 3 people on the table. We asked for an ETA on our drinks and maybe a third fork; we were told that the bartender was swamped (3 people sitting at the bar). So our server meandered to the back and maybe had a nap. We never got the third fork, but luckily the appetizer came with a spoon. Our 2 mixed drinks arrived after our entres were nearly finished.

Bryan B.,"Mesa, AZ",0,19,21,4.0,3/6/2017,"I haven't been to an Applebee's for a while, and had never been in this specific location, so decided to try it out. When entering, the first impression was positive, as the restaurant had a warm and comfortable decor. We opted to sit at the bar, as we sometimes do when there are open seats available. (This is a seating preference, even when not consuming alcohol, as was the case on this visit). The chairs at the bar were actually quite comfortable, as they were swivel chairs with padded seats and full back support. We were promptly greeted by the bartender/server and received our beverages very quickly, as well as 2 full menus and a smaller ""happy hour menu"".  We opted for the wings, which were on special for happy hour, as are ""half price appetizers"". We also decided to get some spinach artichoke dip and chips, since they were half price.  The wings came out of the kitchen surprisingly  quickly, and they actually arrived before the chips and spinach dip. (I think the dip took longer to prepare, and it was very yummy when we did receive it, just a few moments after the wings). The food was prepared well and was tasty. We chose 3 different flavors of wings, and each were appropriately seasoned. They weren't the best wings I've ever had, but they were good, especially for the price.  The server provided good service, as she checked in with us regularly, kept our beverages refilled, and also offered to give us ""to-go"" cups when we were preparing to leave. All in all it was a pleasant dining experience, and with the happy hour prices, the tab was actually very affordable. I'm giving it 4 stars, as even though there was nothing spectacular that really made a strong or charismatic impression on me, conversely there was nothing negative to prompt me to rate it any lower.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-12
Sam K.,"Chandler, AZ",84,40,,2.0,7/22/2016,"Went there last night and lets say, they used to be better.  Maybe it is the location as the one on GIlbert and Baseline is a LOT BETTER. Service Staff - I give an A+.  The service was really good. Waiting to get entrees, D-.  The appetizers came out quickly and it seemed it took LONGER for our actual food. Portions - it is amazing how much SMALLER they are getting.  The Spinach Artichoke Dip is at least 2 to 3 oz smaller over the years, or it seems.  This time it looked a little over cooked and blackened around the corners like it was OVER cooked in the microwave. The Caesar Salads, WAY TOO MUCH DRESSING.  There was MORE DRESSING than salad.  The steak, this time, WAS TOUGH AND CHEWY.  At least they had A-1.  My wife has Chicken and Shrimp which, lets say didn't sit well. My daughters, a little better with the pasta and fiesta lime chicken. If you want a steak, GO TO A STEAK HOUSE.  At least you know it will be A LOT BETTER THAN THIS PLACE.   Do I plan on going back, NOT ANY TIME SOON.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-12
Toni Y.,"Chandler, AZ",1,107,15,5.0,9/2/2016,"I haven't been to this Applebee's before and was greatly surprised. The location was nice, clean and updated. It was busy and there was plenty of waitstaff, we didn't have to wait at all during dinner rush which was nice. I love seeing the many neighborhood locals who know each other as I got seated, I love that feel.  Our waitress Ashley was quick to greet and get drinks and appetizers going, she did a great job to check in frequently since we wanted some happy hour pricing drinks. The menu had great simplicity and variety, our kids actually ate all their food for once, and they stayed entertained with the tablet. I tried a new brew house dish and hubby had tasty wings. The manager was so sweet, she brought out our dish and noticed the fries looked like it sat out a while so she brought us new fries. That was very kind and I love her high expectations for quality and appreciate that. Our server Ashley was great, she was sweet and attentive.

TJ H.,"Chandler, AZ",652,242,348,5.0,1/15/2016,"Another Monday night and K was jonesin for a burger. Applebee's here we come. We were greated by the hostess who took us to a table. Our server was Raymond. He was awesome. Spot on, got the job done. Wasn't intrusive and carried on a conversation when appropriate. Kudos. C got the Classic Burger w/ Cheese and pickles on the side. ($6.99 Monday). The patty was a perfect medium, the cheese was ooey gooey melted good stuff. He ended up with 17 pickles on the side. Nice. C gave it a double thumgs up. K ordered the Mushroom Swiss Burger ($6.99 Monday). Again, the patty was a perfect Medium Rare, the Swiss was completely melted and there were a lot of mushroom slices. K said this was one of the best burgers she has had here. I ordered the Brunch Burger ($6.99 Monday). This is my favorite burger. And tonight, it was done as well as it can be. The sunny side up egg was perfect. When I sliced through it the yolk ooozed down over the hash brown. The patty was a perfect Medium Rare, seasoned just right. OMG I love this burger. Spot on tonight. I do have to note that in the past the fries were unlimited, as per the commercial on TV. Evidently there was a lot of grief about it and so according to the manager, no more unlimited fries with the Monday night $6.99 Any Burger special. Really, no big deal because none of us really wanted or needed any more fries. Our drinks were $2.49 which is totally fair. Great Service. Great Monday night Burger special. Great Food.

Jalecia W.,"Mesa, AZ",61,18,6,1.0,6/12/2015,"Terrible. Don't ever go to this restaurant. My fiancé and I thought it would be convenient to order online and do car side pickup. When we arrived to the location, I had to get out to get my food. Not only that but they didn't have some of the food ready. I always already waiting an extra 20 minutes just to get my bag, which they offered no compensation for the additional wait. Upon getting the food, the ribs were burnt; the fries were limp and tasteless; the chicken penne was rubber and not made with penne noodles and the mozzarella sticks were hard. I will never ever eat here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-12?start=20

Mary C.,"Mesa, AZ",0,3,,1.0,12/14/2013,"Burgers are great! Classic turkey sandwich is amazing - real turkey, not lunch meat. We go here all the time! However, went to restaurant this past Saturday, at 4:30pm with my husband, son, daughter-in-law and 2 grand daughters. It was empty!!! Yet it took over 25 minutes to get our meals. Mine - salmon - was overdone, vegetables were awful and potatoes were lacking. Pushed my plate away after tasting the salmon. Shared ribs with my husband - they were ""okay'  - not great ...BUT the chicken wanton tacos were AWESOME!! (my daughter-in-law shared!). These were piping hot so apparently all of our dinners were cooked first and waited on the wanton tacos. After voicing my dislike for the salmon, manager came to our table, apologized and moved on. He did take it off the check. . Dessert then came late...they brought out cake/ice cream out WAY before they brought the sundae for my grand daughter's birthday. WHAT? Then it took over 15 minutes for us to get the check.  It was awful and we won't go here again. So  sad, cause it's right around the corner and convenient. But.....bad food, bad service?

Micah D.,"Tempe, AZ",28,54,,3.0,10/19/2007,"We stopped off for a drink here on our way out to other things.  She had a strawberry daquiri which wasn't bad at all.  I was inspired to drink something fruity and ended up drinking a strawberry pina colada which was terrible.  I don't know what I was thinking.  The Pina Colada song started playing in my head and I felt compelled.  Rest assured it's a compulsion I will be able to resist until I'm on a beach in the Bahamas.  Which will be like, never since I'm not a big tropical beach person. Big D had a martini and said it wasn't so great.  A wave of whimsey crashed against the rocks of my disappointment (or perhaps chunks of ice) in my pina colada, and I had a craving for broccoli cheese soup.  It was edible, but nothing spectacular.  I think I'm too hard on such things.  Cheese soups aren't easy to get right I suppose, because it seems to fall below my expectations at most places, but when they get it right I am in cheese laden nirvana. The only reason I gave them 3 stars instead of 2 was that the service was excellent.  Our server was always checking in with us, asking about drink refills, talked with us about menu items - in an informative and non-pushy way - answering all of our questions and making conversation rather than suggestive selling.  She was just very attentive and very nice which always makes me happy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-12?start=60

She said no that's correct. I up front apologized for anything bad our kids may do and Laura our AMAZING waitress smiled and said no worries everything will be fine and not to worry. Just as she said the night was worry free and Laura made us feel welcome like the balloon guy did.

Jaime F.,"Sacramento, CA",265,79,,2.0,1/13/2011,"The boyfriend inexplicably received an Applebee's gift card from one his aunts that takes too many pictures and never throws anything away.  Those last details were entirely beside the point.  He never expressed any out of the ordinary interest in this famous chain, but nonetheless we were left with a 25 dollar gift card and no choice but to man the crowded booths of our local Applebee's.  It's odd when you never go to chain restaurants how much you notice the differences between them and other places we normally eat.  We went on a Wednesday night and there were people waiting for a table.  Two million restaurants in Phoenix and these assholes are WAITING for mediocre chain food.  There were only two of us so we were seated promptly at a two top near the kitchen and instantly were mesmerized by the completely muddled,  incoherent memorabilia that lines the walls of this place.  A photo of Marilyn Monroe, next to a Route 66 sign, next to a football helmet, next to a baseball hat, next to a picture of Johnny Carson with a cigar or someshit.  Perhaps it is difficult, or rather simply unnecessary, to provide your restaurant with an easily deciphered theme.    Not that anyone who is eating at Applebee's gives a fuck.  Another thing I noticed about the ambiance is that this is certainly a watering hole for those afflicted with that whole ""obesity epidemic"" thing here in America.  And I'm not being a bitch, man, there were just a lot of fat people there. Our server, an over weight Latino man with a raspy voice and  purposeful speed takes our drink orders right away.  We both get Long Islands which are served in an obscenely sized goblet straight out of the 18th century.  I am small and I don't work out and I hate when drinks are fucking so heavy that I have to use two hands.  I understand that it is now a trademark of these types of restaurants to make their drinks large, colorful and spectacular- but I can't help but pretentiously think as I lift the four pound concoction of watered down syrup and ice, ""this is just fucking retarded."" We order a few appetizers; the spicy bone-in wings and mozzarella sticks.  The wings are dinky and under salted but not disgusting.  The mozzarella sticks were... mozzarella sticks.  You can't really go wrong or right with fried cheese but they got cold fast and the cheese hardened.   The redeeming quality of our Applebee's outing was our likable and attentive server.  While we never really make our way to chain restaurants (as there is just so much other good shit Phoenix has to offer), it was sort of nice to have a friendly and non-hipster server.  A guy not concerned with spouting off specials and showing us the wine list and judging us if we order domestic instead of premium,  just a giant Mexican dude probably with a family of four at home trying to make some good tips.  And I guess that's always the nice, homey thing about chain places; it's all just so average and normal and sometimes that feels like comfort.  I can't honestly say that I'll return to Applebee's anytime soon unless we come across another gift card from another relative that takes too many pictures and doesn't throw anything away, but I can say that it was an overall interesting experience to be out of our comfort zone, talking and watching the hoards of middle Americans order their steak and shrimp or chicken fried steak and shovel it in their mouth while they talk about how the fuck they're going to pay the mortgage this month. Maybe our server can pay HIS with the giant tip we left him.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-12?start=40
