Robert S.,"Mesa, AZ",1,10,29,4.0,1/12/2016,"I appreciate some of the items on the new menu, but I do wish they were more balanced meals. Gone of the days of the salad o start your meal and it seems that the majority of menu items are meat and starch. Where are the veggies? The chicken & shrimp is tasty; with a few mushrooms and onions under the bird. The roasted potato side is cooked perfectly...some crispy edges and fluffy centers. The brisket enchiladas are really good. The menu shows 3, but you will only get 2. Love the green chile sauce and the salsa has just a tinge of a kick. Too much for our 96yo grandma, but that is understandable. Keep in mind that this is pub fare.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-13

Rob J.,"Mesa, AZ",72,42,,1.0,7/15/2017,Headed to Applebee's with my family for the first time in a long time last night.... I ordered the chipotle chicken strips with macaroni and cheese off of the two for 25 menu and my food was served to me lukewarm and the macaroni Tasted old. When I complain in a nice way my waiter took my meal back to the kitchen and the other two people in my party pretty much had their dinner done by the time my food finally came back.   and when it came back it was piping hot and very good.   I was thinking that the manager would come over because I had to send my food back or that the server would comp  my meal or give us a free dessert none of that happened    pretty disappointing.  We will not go back to Applebee's at all especially this one,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-13
Jill S.,"Mesa, AZ",67,6,,2.0,1/26/2017,This location has had issues that have come and gone . When your waiter doesn't know the difference between  doughy and soft.  The pretzels have not been done twice ( hey give the place another shot) .  When things aren't completely cooked it's it necessarily safe .   There are  little to no stuff actually working and the place is packed .

Hillary T.,"Mesa, AZ",133,156,78,4.0,3/14/2016,"I have always liked Applebee's. From their food to the service it's definitely deserves a 4 star rating in my book. My husband and I stopped for supper tonight. Tonight was burger night, that meant you could get any burger and fries for $6.99. As enticing as that sounded we decided to order off the 2 for $20 menu. You get one appetizer and certain menu choices for 20 dollars. Our appetizer was the spinach artichoke dip with tortilla chips. This dip is so good. Warm and creamy. The entree I chose was the chicken tenders and fries. It comes with your choice of ranch, honey mustard or bbq sauce. I chose the honey mustard. The chicken strips are good, the breading is lightly seasoned. The fries are crispy, but over salted and seasoned for my taste. The honey mustard sauce is thick, creamy and not too sweet. It's perfect. The service is great. Tonight the place was busy, but our server never faltered on checking on us and making sure we were taken care of. I will be back as this is one of my favorite restaurants,",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-13
Haeley R.,"Mesa, AZ",4,15,157,2.0,3/16/2016,"The restaurant itself was nice, and the service was pretty okay (they were fantastic at keeping drinks refilled!), but the food was a complete bust. The mozzarella sticks were bland and the sauce was a really weird flavor. The spinach and artichoke dip was ATROCIOUS, had no texture, and tasted like broccoli. I ordered the fiesta lime chicken, and it was a reheated nightmare. The sauce on the chicken was too salty, and the melted cheese had hardened on top of the chicken. The only thing that made it lime chicken was the tiny slice of lime on the side. I also could have done without the huge nest of soggy chips underneath the chicken, which was the majority of the dish.  The Spanish rice was also dry, looked old, and was pretty bland.  Overall, it was a disappointment, and it's a good thing we had a giftcard, otherwise I would not have wanted to pay for this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-13

Christine M.,"Mesa, AZ",58,25,1,1.0,7/24/2017,"I have stayed away from Applebee's for several years as they ALWAYS made a mistake on my order. I always order car side to go. I am a busy professional and I eat out quite frequently. I placed my order. As always, my order was not on time. (When I placed my order online I was given a time it would be ready ) I waited a good 10minutes before I was acknowledged. I received my order in another 15minutes. I get home and I find out that they messed up my order. Mind you it's 115 degrees outside and I live about 15-20min away. I call the store to speak with a manager. She offered to remake my meal and I would travel to go pick it up or she could report it to Corporate and they would send me something. It was hot out and I was tired. I opted for Corporate to send me something. I received two $5 coupons. The audacity...the insult!! I am sure I spent close to $40 on my order. The $5 coupon is a slap in the face! I will not take time out of my day to order a meal and be treated poorly as a customer!

Mine was the quesadilla burger, hers was the chicken tenders. The order came with French fries. Our appetizer was the spinach artichoke dip with nacho chips. As always the dip was good. Creamy and smooth, almost want to just eat it with a spoon good. I ordered the quesadilla burger which was my first time ordering this. This is a hamburger wrapped in a quesadilla made with Monterey Jack cheese. The burger was cooked perfectly to my specifications. It was sandwiched in a quesadilla composed of melted cheese, Pico de Gallo. and grilled flour tortilla. It was a good burger. The only thing that would have made it a 5 star burger would have been chipotle or taco seasoning on the burger. As it was it was a little bland. I got some Tabasco to spice it up a little. The fries were crispy not soggy. I hate soggy.  The service was excellent. It was a full house tonight and Samantha was right there servicing out table as if we were the only ones there.

Craig H.,"Clarkdale, AZ",1,94,4,1.0,12/2/2016,"I want to start by saying I had emailed a very detailed review to the email on my Applebee's receipt over a week ago, still no response, so now it goes on YELP. This was the worst Thanksgiving Dinner/meal I've ever had.  We took my mother last year to this same location, it was $14.99, wonderful, tasty meal.  This year it was $11.99 (which I didn't find out until we walked in) this should have been a tipoff.  The turkey was chopped up, re-heated and dried out, the stuffing (at least I think that's what it was) was 2 small ice-cream scoops of glop, the mashed potatoes were okay, the green beans were okay (a bit garlicky), and instead of cranberry sauce (get this) there were about 7 chopped/dried cranberries sprinkled throughout the plate.  The gravy consisted of a few drips and drabs here and there.  I cannot believe the chef here would take the time to serve this crap for a Thanksgiving meal. A better meal would be served to the homeless...no kidding.  Well, I could go on how the servers looked like they were ready for a football game (wearing their jerseys) instead of last year how they were nicely dressed and FRIENDLY greeting at the front door.  If you're not going to serious about serving a special meal, don't bother at all. BTW, I would have paid even more than $14.99 for something quality, befitting what one would expect for Thanksgiving. If you dine at this location other than a Holiday meal, it is good.

This is mostly because of their 'Presto' automated ordering system.  I find it sad that these chains are now moving to this cold and impersonal ordering system. I like talking to my waiter/waitress, asking what they like, and just the whole personal experience. Maybe I'm weird in that way.  Oh and I also don't want to be advertised to while I'm trying to eat my dinner not play games for $.99 when I came to enjoy the company of the people I came with.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-13
Ti L.,"Mesa, AZ",70,8,,3.0,2/6/2017,So excited to visit one of my favorite places and I have officially been let down again. Not by the food but by the service. While waiting 15 minutes to even order drinks at a time where it isn't that busy we were barley acknowledged. When we were approached by what  I believe to be the manager she was nice enough and we ordered everything at that point.  When our server finally approached us her attitude was OK until we told her we already  put our order in. From there she walks off and groups together with two other younger girls who then turn to look at my table. Just not very professional. Food comes and there are things wrong but we hate to complain so we just proceeded to eat. Food actually was really good they just forgot the bacon on the all-in burger. Not a big deal. I asked for more oriental dressing cause it's awesome and when she brought it back she tosses on table and says here you go girl. At that point I decided she will not receive a tip from me. She was short and rude even though I maintained being a lady I was offended. I am in the service industry dealing with hair which you get all types of clients and situations that challenge your character. It's what you do in those situations that determine your moral fiber.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-13
Mandy A.,"Glendale, AZ",153,6,,1.0,11/10/2016,"My boyfriend and I went here for happy hour around 10PM. As soon as we walked in, the atmosphere was pretty dull and empty. There was maybe another 10 people in the entire restaurant. We waited to be seated for about a good 7 minutes and absolutely no one greeted us. Then after we sat ourselves, we sat at our table talking for a good 10-15 minutes before anyone approached us at our table (we have no been in the restaurant about 20ish minutes with no one attempting to welcome or assist us) - reminding you that it was not busy in the slightest. Eventually, it got to the point where we pushed the ""Call Server"" button on the little table kiosk and she still didn't come for another 5 minutes. I look over toward the rear of the restaurant and all the waitresses, other than the bartender, were sitting down in a booth talking and not responding to their tables. Finally, we are helped, but the service continues to be just as poor. The waitress brought us our drinks and our food slowly and after that she visited our table once, and it still was not busy so we should've been a piece of cake for her to handle. My boyfriend and I both work in jobs that require exceptional customer service and know how terrible it is to get a bad review on your store location and typically we wouldn't post one, but I never had worse service than I have with this experience. Every other Applebee's I've been to has always done really amazing! So I'm sad to say that this location wasn't up to par standards. Definitely won't be going back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-13

Elorie K.,"Mesa, AZ",172,4,,1.0,12/10/2013,"Let me first say that this is a review of this restaurant in particular, on this specific evening, not overall of Applebee's.  We come to this Applebee's several times a month, whether it be for late night happy hour or for Kid's Eat Free on Tuesdays. Mostly on Kids eat free Tuesdays. I'm a single mom and on a budget, so we go a couple of Tuesdays a month and I will get a half price appetizer and a drink and my son will eat for free a $3.99 kids meal. It's a great deal when both of us eat for $10 including tip. Not tonight, though. Although I've never had an issue before, my bill came back and I made the server aware that my son's meal was not taken off. He said he'd speak with his Manager. The manager, Jamie, came over and was confrontational from the start. She stated that this is a business and that I can't have my son's meal for free because that just doesn't make sense because his meal is the same price as mine. She said that it was free with an Entree and that the sign out side said so and that I could go check. I let her know that I wasn't aware that the policy had changed since the last time we'd been and that I had to order an entree (which I've never had to do in the past).  She continued to say that I'm lying that I've been before on Tuesdays because she does inventory and she's here every Tuesday. She continued on in front of other patrons stating that this is a business that needs to make money. I paid, left embarrassed and will probably never return to this Applebee's again, if any. Our server was a doll, the food was just ok as usual, but the nightmare of this manager was enough to say no thank you to ever returning.  As I was leaving, I checked the sign outside, and of course there is no mention of ""free with purchase of Entree"" anywhere on the building. Sooo I took a picture to post of that sign too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-13?start=40

She was so fun and invited us back the following week when they were having a Disney dress up day with the staff. Tuesday being kids night we were happy to return.

I asked if it was the same price as the Sutter Home..told it wasn't but was advised she would ""give it to me at that price today because I was having a bad day"". Why should I pay more for an ""upsell"" when they didn't have what was on the menu?  Ordered sandwich with fries.

He seemed totally disinterested but he did comp my lunch. The bartender/waitress came with our check and she basically admitted that we were served the ""leftovers"" from the early lunch service. This Applebees has gone downhill in the past several years. We used to have lunch here quite often in the late 1990's but we will not be back.

Mike K.,"Mesa, AZ",1,22,62,3.0,10/22/2014,I had a chicken sandwich with a house salad . The food was very fresh and flavorful. But we were a little up set by the service. It was so slow that the appetizer came after the food.  Probably won't be back anytime soon.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-13?start=20
JKtravel S.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,116,32,2.0,3/19/2016,Why is this place busy?  Burger and salmon were both over cooked; third entre presentation was blah. Service was slow but friendly.

Vanessa C.,"Mesa, AZ",7,18,3,2.0,12/16/2014,"I really want to like this Applebee's but I just don't. I keep trying and am disappointed every time. We recently went there for dinner and the service was AWFUL. They were sort of busy but not THAT busy. We placed an order for an appetizer which came out after our meal was served. This is the THIRD time this has happened there. I don't understand why this is so difficult to get right!? Our waitress gave a pathetic , ""Eh, sorry"" and walked away. You could at least ACT like you cared a smidgen. No drink refills either, which irked me. Lunch is somewhat better. At least the service is, anyway. I do love their all you can eat salad and soup at lunch.  I am also not sure why, but the ice tea at this Applebee's and at the IHOP across the street taste funny. Maybe the water? Apparently other people have commented on it as well, because the wait staff have agreed some people notice that taste.  It is a slightly longer drive to go to the Applebees on Gilbert, but I feel like the service is definitely better there, and that is where we will be going from now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-13?start=20
Todd M.,"Torrance, CA",33,20,26,1.0,1/26/2015,"Food was good, but ""Samantha"" pretty much ignored me. I had to leave my table and walk across the restaurant to the bar to get a refill on my Diet Pepsi.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-13?start=20
Ashlie H.,"Mesa, AZ",706,292,239,2.0,2/13/2013,"Not so happy, happy hour at this Applebee's.  Happy hour is awesome typically at any Applebee's, but the amount of time it took for us to get everything we ordered was disappointing. When we were first seated it took our waitress about 10 minutes to even acknowledge that we were new customers waiting to give our order. Once we ordered our drinks it took another 10 minutes to have them delivered (2 beers isn't a mix drink that a bartender has to create, right out of the tap, should have taken 5 minutes tops). When our waitress finally delivered our drinks, she ran to the table dropped the bees off and darted away, at this time we were ready to order our food and she didn't even ask us if we were ready. After flagging her down we were finally able to order our food. After about 35 minutes we flagged her down again for she had walked past our table several times and didn't give us an update about what was taking so long, nor ask us if we wanted another round of drinks. Once our food finally came out, things didnt get any better. The buffalo wings were tasty, but my steak was dry and tough. The mashed potatoes and broccoli that came along with my steak wasn't awful tasting, but also nothing special. My friend ordered a burger and said the same thing. It's just a burger nothing awesome about it but nothing nasty about it. Im sure the kitchen gets backed up during happy hour, but that is when the waiters and waitresses should be on their toes checking on their tables to put the wait for food at ease. At this time the cooks need to make sure they still care about food quality and not worry so much about just getting the food out the door. *Currently looking for a happy, happy hour place*",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-13?start=20
Greg M.,"Mesa, AZ",0,196,19,1.0,8/28/2013,"August 27, 2013  5:15pm. I ordered the 7 oz sirloin medium rare with mashed potatoes and broccoli. The veggies were fine, so was the service. The water in my glass was nasty metallic tasting. My steak was easily the worst meat I've ever been served in my life. It was an odd looking long banana-shaped thing that did not taste like beef at all. Maybe it was goat or horse but IT WAS NOT BEEF. It sort of tasted like the jerked goat burgers I had in Jamaica. I've been eating beef my entire life, this tasted nothing like, looked nothing like, and had the consistency nothing like any beef I've ever had, in my life. Don't think I'll be going back there. Ever. I did not want to complain at the store because there is no coming back from being served a piece of meat like this, it should have never been served to a human customer. Complaining only jeopardizes your safety in any restaurant. Never send food back to the kitchen for replacement is my philosophy. We simply cut short our visit and got the hell out without saying a word. I'll express my displeasure by never returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-13?start=20
A A.,"Mesa, AZ",13,6,2,1.0,4/27/2015,Service is terrible! Got back on our bike and drove to Applebee's at Southern and Power. Got here and got and drink and our food ordered I believe before we would have even been acknowledged at the one on this review. Skipping it altogether would be my recommendation!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-13?start=20

Leonard P.,"Mesa, AZ",1,5,,3.0,2/24/2014,"I went here to have a quick sit down at the bar and a bite with a friend at the bar. I expected to have a relatively good time, but little did I know the bar was being hosted that night by the Ice Queen. Cold treatment from this host from the moment we first ordered our beers, complete with being chided over my perfectly valid ID, to having to ask for a menu after waiting quite some time (instead of being asked if we wanted food, like most bartenders would??) so we could even get the food we came for! When the food came, the wings looked like someone had quite literally emptied a sauce bottle over them - they were sitting in a puddle! Never had to dip a wing 4-5 times in ranch just to get some on it before! At least the Quesadilla was tasty, though I really didn't appreciate being disagreed with by the bartender about leaving off the Pico de Gallo. Tomatoes make me violently sick, I don't need your bloody opinion about them being on the dish! Thankfully, an otherwise infuriating experience was mostly rectified by the bubbly friendliness of the waiter who came to send the previous bartender on a break. The replacement and her friendly, happy demeanor is probably the main reason why I didn't simply walk out. While I still rushed my dinner (and my friends) so we could get the heck out of dodge, it was a relief to see that the first employee wasn't a wholly accurate example of the staff. Primarily for that reason I'm willing to give three stars, unlike the one or two I angrily wanted to. I hope my experience with the staff to be a fluke.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-13?start=20

Sherrie F.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,2,,4.0,1/8/2015,"Love coming to this Applebee's on Power and Ray because the food is great for a chain restaurant and the staff is always nice.  I recently tried one of their new Under 600 calorie dishes. Let me just say, you have to try the Cedar Lemon Chicken. The chicken was so tender and it came with diced cucumbers and green apples on top with a light lemon sauce. The rice was a blend of white rice, quinoa (not sure I spelled that right) cranberries, and pecans! YUM!!! Think I found my new favorite dish. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-13?start=20
Callie M.,"Mesa, AZ",77,25,4,2.0,8/30/2013,"I just left this place with my friend, the only pro is that the waiters were super friendly and the service was fast, got our food pretty quick considering it was busy. We came during happy hour so our drinks were pretty cheap, my friend actually got wasted from all the discounted alcohol. I just got plain chicken tenders and fries, they were good but the honey mustard sauce was too sweet. My friend ordered a steak (medium rare) baked potatoes with a side of broccoli. He said his potato and the broccoli were delicious but his steak was far from medium rare and it had a chewy, plastic consistency. I really don't expect much from Applebee's but I don't appreciate paying 17 dollars for a small steak and having it taste like complete crap.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-13?start=20
Chris D.,"Chandler, AZ",6,59,,2.0,5/19/2014,"Something about this particular Applebee's is off-putting. The food wasn't as good as others, the interior wasn't as inviting and like others, the waiters would all meet up at the bar and talk to each other until someone walked in to be seated. Would be ideal if they moved out and they were replaced. Will try to avoid it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mesa-13?start=20
