R C.,"Metairie, LA",0,3,,1.0,8/4/2014,"I just got back to my computer after eating  at this place.  I walk in and it took 10 minutes to get a table, and there were about 20 tables available!  They seat me at a ""high table""...I am by myself, nice to be put on display for all to see.  The waiter comes over and asked what kind of drink I would like.  I told him I was ready to order.  I ordered a 9 oz. house steak ""medium"" and baked potato with sour cream and butter.  He said they only had broccoli for a vegetable.  I asked if I could substitute with a house salad and he said no substitutes.  Not everyone likes broccoli...I like raw broccoli with dip, but cooked is disgusting to me to begin with.  I have no options.  I've never been to a restaurant where you didn't have more than one choice for vegetable.  Amazing!   The meal is served 20 minutes later.  All half cold.  My steak was well done not medium, the baked potato only had a small amount of sour cream, and one broccoli stalk with small buds on the ends.  If this were marijuana, you wouldn't have enough to even catch a buzz.  This was my only choice of vegetable?  I cut off the stalk of the broccoli which was tough to cut even with a steak knife, and at the three bites of broccoli.  I had already waited 30 minutes to get the food, and experience has taught me that if you send your food back, guess what?  Yea, you get the replacement 15 to 20 minutes later.  At the point of seeing everything that was wrong, I just wanted to get the hell out of there.  The centerpiece that holds the salt was sticky when I turned it to reach the shakers.  Oh yea, of all the empty tables available when I came in, they seated me at a dirty table.  I told the waiter about it and he handed me 2 napkins.  WTF!  I got all this aggravation for the price of $16.00.  I could have had a great meal at Copelands for that price!  Sorry I made the mistake of eating at this place.  Amazing! I read every review of this restaurant and noticed that everyone said it sucked.  They are all correct in their assessment of this place.  What is even worse is that I'm sure the upper management and owners at this ""establishment"" read these complaints and choose not to do anything to correct them.  Not only should the restaurant manager be fired, the upper management should be also for allowing this to degenerate like this.  I hadn't eaten in a place this bad since Juarez, Mexico many years ago.  No, wait a minute...I think Juarez was better, and they actually put liquor in their drinks.  Amazing. To sum this complaint up, as long as there are low-standard expecting people eating here, it will remain in business.  My god, what do they eat at home to think that this place is "" really good""?  SHAME ON APPLEBEES...NEVER AGAIN WILL I EAT THERE!!!!!  Amazing! By the way, I had to put one star on this site or I couldn't continue.  It deserves NO STARS!!!   Close this dump!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-metairie-3?start=40

Eric S.,"Arabi, LA",29,173,74,2.0,6/11/2012,"Have had better at other places, a typical low grade chain restaurant. Normally i don't like to go to big chain restaurants because of the lack of individual personality. I went here for a Charitable Animals rights for life event where they got 20% of any flier brought it. Seating didn't take long, but on the way to the table you could smell a musky smell, like wet carpet but i blew it off. Our waitress was very nice and pleasing we got our drinks fast. We split the trio between 5 people, and i wish it was bigger i got a bite of each thing just enough to make me even more hungry for my main meal. I ordered the Shrimp and Steak under 500 cal meal w/ Broccoli n potatoes, Nearly everyone at the table ordered the same. We waited the normal time for our food to start arriving, everyone got there food except one. One persons food was little cold, other sauce was cold, my food was ok, but my steak had a odd texture like if it was over processed. we were nearly done our meals by the time the last persons food came out, and even then it wasn't fully heated. Ow everyone ordered med rare steaks and we all got medium to med well. I know i wont go back to this place unless its another Charity event. The staff is very nice and pleasing but that place needs a good cleaning and kitchen staff needs a refresher course on cooking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-metairie-3?start=40
Trent T.,"Kenner, LA",0,4,,1.0,1/15/2013,"My wife and I ate here with our 2yr old for dinner.  I ordered a Burger, my wife ordered a steak and our 2yr old had mac and cheese with chicken.  When we were seated the table was still dirty and the hostess just tried to cover the crumbs with the menu from what it seemed. I had to ask her to wipe the table for us.  We ordered and asked for our sons food to come out first.  It did, and the spoon they gave him was dirty.  We asked the server for another spoon and she brought  us plastic-ware which was nice... maybe she was thinking all the silverware would be dirty? (I'm glad she took the extra step to bring us something she knew would be clean.)  My burger was pretty good (a little on the small side but taste was OK.) As for my side dish of broccoli... a few bites in and I see a long hair... We asked for the manager and she took off my wife's meal as she did not eat much before losing her appetite from seeing the hair.  After explaining all of our issues to the manager she looked like it was a normal everyday thing.  The only positive thing I can say about this place was the server.. I don't remember her name for sure, but I think it was Jessica if I had to take a stab at it.  She did everything she could to correct the issues and was very sorry about everything.  Will not be back... If you are looking for a big chain restaurant to eat at, head up the road as there are others..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-metairie-3?start=40

After opening the order  when I arrived at home, it was not what I expected. I called Applebee's about my order and they were completely rude to me, telling me that I should have asked for the sauce for the wings on the side. I explained to him that I was not aware that I should've asked for the wings that way. The guy on the phone basically told me that it wasn't his problem.

Gavin M.,"Metairie, LA",0,16,,1.0,4/9/2016,"It's like these mega chain dine in restaurants all have to have some type of atmosphere... Applebee's has the atmosphere of the freezer section of Rouses, but with more plastic memorabilia, and copies of classic photos. Strange thing is - I like it. Although it's a sit down type of joint, I get the same strain of diarrhea I get from a McDonald's drive thru. The honey mustard is ON POINT. The free refills on cokes and sprites are top notch. Endless apps. Need I say more? Well I will say more. Bee's, as I like to call it, always delivers on that fake family atmosphere combined with the appeal of a generic sports bar from a sterile sitcom you could have watched between the 70s and 90s. They have a drive thru now, if you want that soft serve bowel movement on the go. If a civil war broke out between Chile's and Bee's I would definitely side with Bee's, even if they use slave labor. Get lost Chile's. Applebee's also has a Barnes and Noble in the parking lot. Can Olive Garden, Chile's, or TGIFridays say that? Never went to the bathroom there, but my bathroom at home is NOICE.

I order the new pub philly which is suppose to come on ciabatta bread but came out on regular toast, and suppose to come with a dipping sauce. I asked the bartender about the bread and he informed they are out of the ciabatta bread, would have been nice to know when ordering.

Elise R.,"Austin, TX",101,13,3,1.0,12/23/2012,"My boyfriend and I were in a weakened state after braving Toys R Us 3 days before Christmas. After some shopping at Barnes and Noble, we decided on eating at Applebee's because we wouldn't have to repark the car in order to eat there. Perhaps our fatigue can be blamed for the oversight of deciding to eat at Applebee's; our standards for dining were certainly lower than normal that night. As long as we could get something to eat relatively quickly, that's all we were expecting. Alas, we would be served no food that night at Applebee's... We were seated quickly, but our waitress took somewhere from 3 to 5 minutes to come take our drink order. My minimum requirement at a restaurant is that a waiter or waitress at least acknowledge me within the first 1 to 2 minutes, even if they can't take my drink order right away. When the waitress finally made it to our table, I ordered a water and a Maker's and Coke. My boyfriend ordered the same. The waitress asked if Pepsi would be okay, which I was fine with. My boyfriend changed his order to Kettle One and Sprite (Sierra Mist, actually, but whatevs.) The waitress came back to our table with huge 32 oz. glasses of soda and water. My boyfriend asked if the sodas had alcohol in them, and the waitress looked really confused. We had to explain that we were trying to order cocktails, so she took the sodas back and went to retrieve our liquor. This was the point where my boyfriend and I realized that things were not going to go as planned. After a few minutes the waitress came back and told my bf that they didn't have Kettle One, and would Amaretto be okay. I asked her if she was referring to some kind of Amaretto vodka, and she said yes. I was skeptical, and my bf was just confused, so I intervened and asked her for Grey Goose instead. Things were going downhill fast. The waitress came back with our drinks, which were again in huge 32 oz. cups. Considering the fact that Applebee's has an actual bar with martini glasses and wine glasses, we found it odd that they didn't have small cocktail glasses. My drink was incredibly strong  and my bf's was watered down and weak. Go figure. Oh well, we were hungry, so I ordered a hamburger and bf ordered a steak. A few minutes later the waitress came back to tell me they had run out of hamburger buns, and would I mind my burger on texas toast? I was like, no I don't want my burger on toast, and asked to order something else. But by then my bf had lost his patience and we just cancelled our food order and paid for the drinks and left.  The only upside to the experience was getting go-cups for our cocktails and walking around Lakeside Mall with them. It made the rest of our Christmas shopping way more bearable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-metairie-3?start=20

Ashley R.,"Carmichael, CA",24,43,25,1.0,10/12/2011,"This was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had.  In my whole life.  Yes, it was really THAT bad.  So I was out with my mom for a girl's day and naturally we headed straight for a shopping expedition at the mall.  After hours of trying things on and preening in the mirror, by the time we escaped from the mall we were ravenous, and not feeling too picky.  It had been a long time since I'd gone to an Applebee's, and this visit refreshed my memory as to why, also placing it on my permanent blacklist.   The service was mediocre, the spinach dip tasted like a microwaved concoction, and the restaurant was freezing cold.  I felt like I was loitering in a sub zero freezer while waiting for my food.  If only it had been cold enough to deaden my taste buds.  I got a salad, which should be a safe bet at just about any restaurant.  The chicken was supposedly grilled, but it was more like the flesh of a 10 day old corpse than meat from a bird.  I was afraid I would get salmonella if I ate it so I wisely avoided it after that first bite of zombieflesh.  This was the worst salad I've ever had, and I love salad.  My mom got a salad too, and her lettuce was not just wilted, it was brown, and was obviously about a week past its 'sell by' date.  Her soup was obviously canned.  The cook who put this shit out masquerading as food should seriously be ashamed of himself, and deserves a kick in the balls for serving this crap, and the manager who runs this 'restaurant' should be fired, stat. In my defense for even going here, I can only say that shopping for all that time must have put me into some kind of mental stupor, thus the choice of Applebee's.  It's not a mistake I'll make again.  In fact if Johnny Depp called me up and said he wanted to meet me at Applebee's for lunch, I'd turn him down flat.  This place seriously needs a visit from the health department, because there's no way in hell the food I got was fresh, and I fully expect it was a scene from Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares back there.  Avoid at all costs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-metairie-3?start=20

My friends and I love Friday Night Lights so for the first highschool football game of the season we went to Applebees to see if Tyra was working.  She wasn't.  Our waitress was incredibly nice and great at her job but a shame she works at Applebees.  We were really excited about the menu because everything looks incredible in the picture. When you get it though it is always a disappointment.  I got the burger with and egg and hash browns on top. There were 3 strands of hash browns on top which almost made me cry.  The egg was nice and runny though so that was  a plus.  It just tasted like a standard burger which was fine but not worth the add ons.   A buddy got the spicy burger with jalapenos and and pork.  He said it was meh but very very very spicy.  Another friend got some turkey sandwich and took one bite and saved the rest for the garbage.   We started off with the pretzel sticks and cheese; barely any dipping cheese so that was a bust.  Sticks were pretty good but really needed about 5x the dip.

Never a good smell for a restaurant, me thinks.  Our server was super sweet and attentive. I liked her. We had the 2/$20. My friend had the cedar spiced lemon chicken and loved it. I had the chicken tender basket and it was Ok. After reading ""kitchen confidential"" by Anthony Bourdain, I am more conscious of what I order on particular days of the week.  We also had the brownie sundae which was also alright. I would have given this place 3* but the smell really ruined it for me. Maybe everything needs to be scrubbed down -including walls?

We had kobe meatballs, double crunch bone in wings, green bean fries, wonton tacos, and boneless wings. The kobe meatballs were delicious. They were covered in mozzarella cheese and served in marinara sauce. The bone in wings were also delicious. I had them with the sweet Asian chili sauce. The green bean fries are always a crowd pleaser. Fried green beans are yummy. These were kinda salty though. My wife loves the wonton tacos. She gets them every time. The boneless wings were your typical fried chicken bites covered in bbq sauce. I never understood the concept of boneless wings. Call it what it really is: fried chicken bites.

Finally our order was taken we ordered two sets of appetizers, one came out right a way the other came out after the meal got to the table.  Now let's talk about the meal two things ordered were ok. My daughter had pasta and it taste like they added sugar to it, the pasta was so bad she took one bit and could not eat any more, then everyone took a taste and we all agreed that it had a lot of sugar in it. My aunt had a steak it was tuff, stringy and raw. The second appetizer that came to the table had hair in it. We had to send it back. The waitress never asked or came back to fill any one's drink at the table.  When she asked how the food was (she could clearly see) that there were two full dishes of food that had never even been touched. We told her horrible she said oh here's the bill and thanks. WTH ??? My food sucks and all you can say is here's the bill ???? No offer to get a manager or apologize for the poor food quality and service. Then to top it all off she tried to double charge for the appetizers that were send back with hair in it.  I would starve before I went here and wasted my money. I've had better food at a corner store. This is the last time I go to Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-metairie-3
Rob S.,"Fullerton, CA",126,21,,5.0,1/4/2017,"I love Applebee's. Admittedly, I prefer the Applebee's in Elmwood as opposed to this 'Bee's. But there's nothing wrong with this establishment. Its food is crappy, yes. Nevertheless, you cannot beat the Applebee's ambience (amBeesence, if you will).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-metairie-3
Zhijian J.,"灣仔, Hong Kong",5,1,1,5.0,6/28/2016,"The environment here is great except a little bit noisy. Waitress here is friendly. Space here is a little bit crowded.

Brittany G.,"Metairie, LA",129,148,419,4.0,7/17/2015,"I agree that a 4 out of 5 is high for an Applebee's. I also don't even particularly find this to be an exceptional Applebee's. I'm giving it a 4 out of 5 because they completely met my expectations. When you go there, you know you aren't going to get a dynamite meal with awesome service. It's a family-friendly chain restaurant with fair prices. You get what you pay for. I have personally never had a single meal from any Applebee's that I didn't like/wouldn't eat. Okay, except a few years ago I vomited after eating that bourbon street chicken, but I think I had a stomach virus. I find their BBQ boneless wings great, the whole appetizer sampler is out of this world, and that fiesta chicken is also pretty tasty. I have recently started doing WeightWatchers and the good thing about most chain restaurants is that it is easy to find the nutrition information including the WW points. Applebee's has some pretty friendly WW meals which is what I got when I came to this location last (about 3 weeks ago). I ordered the Thai shrimp salad and my grandma ordered the bruschetta steak which is also on the low calorie menu. I thought both dishes were great! I couldn't believe the WW points for my salad was so low bc it was full of shrimp and the sauce was full of flavor. The mushroom that came with my grandma's steak was so good. She ended up giving it to me bc I kept taking bites. The waitress was a little strange. She tried to be very friendly but overall it felt like she was really rushing us. I didn't mind though because it was a quick lunch at a pretty cheap place, but had this been an up-scale restaurant I would have been a little angry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-metairie-3
Jack J.,"Bossier City, LA",1,19,6,1.0,7/19/2016,"I went in at 4 o'clock, it was obviously the crew lunch time to. I give one star for the two waitresses I saw running around while I watched other crew sit around. It looked like they were busy joking with who looked to be the manger.

Lauren N.,"New Orleans, LA",46,32,24,1.0,10/6/2015,1 star because the food was good. Came here around lunch time with a friend and there wasn't a rush or anything and the service was terrible! Our waitress didn't have any kind of emotion or a cracked a smile not even once but she did for the table behind us. What threw me off the entire experience here was my lemonade with a LONG piece of hair floating in a dirty cup. As soon as our waitress put the drinks down I seen it instantly and when I brought it to her attention it seemed like she knew that it was in there and took it back without even apologizing. And brought me another one in the SAME CUP. Gross. She also threw plates onto the table. Rude. Never coming back to this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-metairie-3

Megan E.,"Metairie, LA",104,2,,5.0,7/9/2016,"Tiffany W was my server and she was AMAZING! She's probably the best server in the restaurant.

Hannah S.,"Metairie, LA",0,13,,1.0,10/1/2016,"Picture this: Sunday (September 18), 6:30pm, three coworkers go for dinner. All three of us experience differing levels of displeasure at the service. Joshua Tate was our waiter. He didn't take my drink order until 15min into my experience. Upon taking my order after 25min, he bungled my companions orders and neglected to being me the extra sauce that he assured me TWICE he would. And halfway through eating our meals, he presented our checks--without us asking. We wanted desert. We wanted drinks. I had my foot stepped on several times throughout this ""meal"" and had to track down my waiter several times for water. He took dishes away from the table before being certain that they had been finished. I didn't leave a tip; controversial, I know. But I received service that was beyond incompetent and bordered on rude. Well, to my surprise Joshua added himself a $10.00 tip onto my bill. Upon contacting the store, I spoke with Ian who explained that I could pick up that $10.00 in cash from him that very evening with no receipt. Then I spoke with Eric, who denied that this was of any fault of my server JOSHUA TATE, and would compensate me the $10.00 plus some extra for my inconvenience. That turned out to be an extra $5.00. Nearly 10 (ten) days after the CRIME. I've advised my friends and family, I've posted on Facebook and Twitter, and now I'm posting here: do not give your money to Applebee's establishments PERIOD. They protect their own, regardless of legality or fault. I didn't tip JOSHUA TATE because I felt he provided me a level of service at a dine-in restaurant below that of what I expected at a fast food restaurant. In fact, I've received better service at a fast food restaurant. I wish I could award ZERO stars to this location and to this corporation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-metairie-3
Linda L.,"Williamsville, NY",24,28,22,2.0,11/8/2014,"Applebee's claims to be a fine dine restaurant when in really it's ""slow"" fast food. A restaurant that needs to douche their food in seasoning and shaves in order to mask the bad quality of their food.  I don't come often but when I do, I come for two things: the oriental salad that has no oriental factor to it at all (maybe the supposed fried asian noodles on top) and the spinach artichoke dip.  I like both of the in a sense of fast food way: it's a craving. Rather then ""let's go to Applebee's for lunch"", it's always ""I'm craving some Applebee's salad."" As for service, they put out the minimum effort required to keep their jobs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-metairie-3
