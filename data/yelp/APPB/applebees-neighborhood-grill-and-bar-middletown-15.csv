Robert G.,"Newport, RI",76,470,673,3.0,5/14/2017,"The only reason I came here is because they have the 2 for $20 deal going on. I have not been to an Applebee's in over 6 years because they were really crappy then. Now, for $20 for an appetizer and dinner for two, it isn't bad. Unfortunately, the place is packed here, people don't know how to manage their kids so their is always a baby screaming. The service here was really nice, it seems that Applebee's is trying to improve their food by cutting prices, but unfortunately, by doing that now the place is packed with people who don't really manage children well resulting in a horribly loud environment. The waitress's eye's looked like she was in a prison, with a constant drowning wailing of children's screams from the other table. I felt kind of bad, the chow was decent we ordered but the lasting memory in my mind was the tables of family's with kids making scenes and parents not taking them outside or trying to pacify them.  I'll skip coming back unless its for lunch where I can avoid the children, the cheap price and improvement in quality isn't worth the pain to my ears...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-middletown-15
Candice K.,"Newport, RI",4,3,4,1.0,1/7/2018,Absolutely never going back! we were greeted by a young man at the door who is very sweet and actually probably the best employee in there. Food was in a timely manner the all you can eat ribs are just bones and sauce not good my dish was the peppered beef over Greens in a broth came out on white rice with no sauce sent out by the kitchen like that without any notification or a chance to change so it was sent back the booth had trash and it we had to ask the trash be removed like old French fries crumpled up receipts just unacceptable two of the staff were staring at us as we were leaving rudely as if we had done something wrong just overall not worth your time,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-middletown-15
William M.,"Fairfax Station, VA",0,4,,2.0,10/23/2017,"Had dinner here...where to begin...Tried to order a reasonably healthy meal which was probably my first mistake. Chicken, broccoli, and grilled veggies.  The chicken was basically a 4oz defrosted breast cooked on a George foreman.  The broccoli was fine, but the grilled veggies included 4 whole slices of squash (both green and yellow varieties!!!) and a ribbon of red pepper with some weird lemon butter sauce.  The veggies were so pathetic it was sad... Our server didn't go over any of their specials.  She also rolled her eyes and said ""oh Jesus"" when we had the audacity to ask for water.   I knew Applebee's was terrible going in, but I guess I hoped it wouldn't be a caricature of bad American suburban cuisine.   The only reason I give them two stars is that they have a nifty device at the table that enables you to pay for the items that you ordered.  This works well for large parties, but it also probably cultivates server laziness...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-middletown-15
Gordon P.,"Syracuse, NY",0,1,,2.0,11/24/2017,"As a frequent traveler, Applebees is my go to in a time pinch.  There are healthy options and its a step above fast food.  Not this one.  This one is awful.  Greeter was absent, food was cold, staff was inattentive and rude.  Step it up Middletown.  Maybe the B team was in charge on Black Friday, but I have no desire to find out.

The desserts are great too.  Their happy hour is really good and 1/2 price late-night appetizers. I love you, Kayla. Thanks for making me feel welcome!!! Update: I've kept coming here.

Angie S.,"Union, NJ",24,25,1,1.0,12/30/2016,"So...we never eat at chain restaurants but we were staying at the hotel attached to the restaurant and wanted a quick bite so we hopped over to Applebees for $5.99 burger night. Our server was very pleasant. We got our drinks and apps and they were great. We got our burgers and after my husband took a few bites of his burger, a long kinky hair was half in his mouth and it had been cooked into the burger. Yuck. The minute we both saw it, we threw our burgers down on our plate while our stomachs turned. We couldn't finish either of our meals after that. I mean noone can after finding a hair cooked into their burger, right? The server got the manager and they took the cost of the burger off the menu and gave us a coupon for a free app next time we come. I just was so disappointed. Ruined our appetite. I really don't know that I'll ever be back to an applebees. Oh and I should mention there were long black hairs stuck inside my husbands menu. It was a very hairy experience all around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-middletown-15
Average J.,"Seekonk, MA",2,58,119,2.0,7/30/2015,"This location is not horrible, but it certainly could have been better. It was empty except for a few booths and a few seats at the bar. We stopped in of super-early bird dinner with the kids. Their meals were fine (mac & cheese with yogurt and strawberries as the side).  The Triple Hog Dare Ya - wasn't much of a dare at all. The commercials on TV and the new menu spread make it seem like you taking on a big meal. It was just OK, a small-ish bun with the three pork layers, cheddar cheese, and thin onion rings. The onion rings by themselves were great. The BBQ sauce on this is too overpowering and took all the flavor away from the meat. I could only taste sauce. I would not order it again.  I would talk about the club sandwich, but it was just a club - nothing great, nothing to complain about. The new BBQ fries taste like Lay's BBQ chips. Pretty tasty, but I can only take a few before I'm tapped out on the BBQ flavor. I recommend a half plain & half BBQ order of fries to balance the flavor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-middletown-15
Liz M.,"North Providence, RI",131,346,375,4.0,6/2/2015,Where to go when it's ten pm and your hungry and need a cocktail? Applebee's. I was obsessed with this place in my twenties and got the to go all the time. Now that I'm older my palate is a little more refined. However this is still a great place to get an appetizer or drink. It's affordable too. Half Priced appetizers after nine pm is always nice. This particular location is always clean. The service is great. They are quick to greet and wait on you. Cheryl is usually the bartender there and she is a gem. She remembers what I like to drink and eat and she's also got a great personality. There seem to be a lot of regulars and she knows them all.  She makes sure the drinks are kept full and also chats with everyone which is nice when dining alone.  The only reason for the four stars instead of five is I'd really like to see more craft beers available there. I know it's a chain but would be great to have a local beer option especially with Newport storm being right down the road. If your in the Middletown area and need a quick drink and snack go see Cheryl. She will take great care of You. !,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-middletown-15
Amanda J.,"Worcester, MA",0,4,,1.0,4/1/2016,"bless the servers heart, she tries and it is not her fault whatsoever that this place is HORRIBLE. they are sorely understaffed and it is clear the kitchen staff needs to be washed out and redone! Our nacho appetizer was gross, the ""beef"" was clearly old and it was hard and cold by the time it got to us. My steak was good and cooked exactly how I asked (only good thing), the ""bacon cheddar"" potatoes were home fries with a little shredded cheese over them, so disappointing. The ""steamed broccoli"" HAD to have been ran under the faucet and put on the plate, it was SOAKED. It is a Friday night and you'd think ok they are slammed have some patience, right? WRONG! The place is maybe halfway filled and these employees are running around crazy and being double-triple sat, they really don't have a chance.  HOWEVER, my daughters kids meal, Kraft Mac and cheese with FF was a hit (go figure!) she loved it. Which was wonderful to me. I have been here once before and the experience was 100X worse - tried again only due to convenience and time! - this time wasn't as bad, by I will steer clear of this place from now on, no matter what!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-middletown-15
John M.,"Somerset, MA",1,39,23,3.0,8/10/2016,The waiter was a wacko the food was okay though. The proportions were tight but the prices were right up there.

Scott M.,"South Windsor, CT",47,2,,1.0,8/15/2016,"We stayed at the Howard Johnson and went over for a late night app. It was honestly the worst dining experience I've ever had. Rude bartenders. Place was a ghost town. Horrible, horrible food. I read all previous reviews and should have listened.  Don't go here, even if it feels convenient. The vending machine is a safer option.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-middletown-15
LE V.,"Columbus, OH",0,1,,2.0,11/14/2016,"Very disappointed. Restaurant conveniently located next to Howard Johnson and looks nice; however, my ""Perfect Margarita"" was weak and way overpriced and my French Onion soup was inedible.  One of the ingredients was stale or spoiled.  I sent it back with the waiter and asked for the manager.   Michelle Lakefield, the manager, was unhelpful. She was argumentative and wasn't interested in finding out if there was a problem with the soup. She didn't bother to apologize for the problem.  I ordered a tomato bisque soup as a replacement. It was a very small serving and tasted like campbell's soup with a few croutons added. At least it was edible. Our waiter was okay.  We won't come here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-middletown-15
Tari B.,"South Saint Paul, MN",13,21,58,1.0,10/24/2015,"So sad. This breaks my heart. I hope this company really made this right if there is such a thing.  I'm usually not the girl to post something like this, but a different heart string was pulled this time considering that I just quit working for the Applebee's company in my hometown after years of giving my all to them & the mere fact that I work very close with children with Autism every day being a special education teacher.

John W.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",1,35,29,3.0,3/7/2016,"My server was very good... The older couple sitting behind me also had a great server.  I listen as she walked that couple through the menu and helped them make decisions they were ultimately happy with.  It was a challenge for sure.  So, my opinion is the serving staff is sound. The kitchen seemed a bit slow, the table and menu were sticky, and the food wasn't great.  The food was just ok... My go to salad had to be sent back because it was soaked in dressing and appeared to be made of scraps.  It came back better.

Cheryl C.,"North Attleborough, MA",0,42,,2.0,8/23/2016,"So unorganized, it really put a damper on our good food.  The person seating us looked like a very unorganized server, and the nice man that waited on us (I think his name was Chris) was extremely pleasant and tried to make up for the disaster that was happening around us. We first got the wrong food and then waited forever for everything, including the check.  This poor young man had tables all over the restaurant.  It was obvious they got bombarded, but come on - a Saturday night in Newport should have enough staff to accommodate the crowds.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-middletown-15

We could not wait for a total reorder and left without eating. The table in back of us called the manager for a problem with their rib order and a table horizontal we saw the manager take the whole plate away.  A party of 4 got up and left when they saw all this going on before ordering, -lucky them !

Vezna S.,"Winthrop, MA",123,397,105,2.0,8/26/2014,"The only saving grace about this place was their bartender at the time. I entered the place and waited a good amount of time to be seated, even though it wasn't that busy. I asked for take-out and was directed to the bar area.  There I was helped by quite a friendly bartender who took my order before helping and mingling with other patrons. It was a LONG wait for the food but I could tell that the bartender actually cared about when it was coming. She was persistently asking the servers and the manager to look into the food and I know for a fact they didn't even bother because no one ever came back to say anything because i was sitting right next to the bartender the whole time. She probably asked 4 times until she went back there herself and got it.  Horrible customer service is a deal breaker for repeat visits. Also, the food was pretty bland. The boneless hot wings were far from spectacular. Microwaved taste and it was cold in the center on some of them so you know it was just popped in the microwave.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-middletown-15

Jamel F.,"Newport, RI",1,9,1,2.0,3/15/2015,"Food is average but not better than Chile's, which is up the road. Prices are decent and drinks are ok. Their downfall is the service. Service was not up to par to other restaurants on the island. Staff are inexperienced and seem lazy and don't want to be there.  Unfortunately the Staff may be lacking due to leadership non existent care of customers experience. My nachos were cold and I brought to attention of waiter. My nachos were the wrong size so when they brought my new hot nachos it was the size of what I paid for and when manager brought them he just said here you go and placed them on table. He didn't ask how I was doing or nothing. Just walked away knowing I had an inexperienced waiter. I will never visit this restaurant.

Richard L.,"Newark, NJ",5,78,20,4.0,4/18/2013,"It's an Applebee's and an okay one so you'll get what you expect from a chain restaurant.   The location isn't bad, service has always been good in my experiences, and the food/drink is fine.  You probably won't really find significantly better quality food in the Newport area restaurants.   Presentation and ambiance are obviously higher end at those restaurants, but this Applebee's will fill you up and provide a place for you to hang out with friends, etc.  I don't know why the previous reviews were so bad.  I've been here multiple times and have always had good experiences.   Get yourself a pitcher of sangria and some appetizers during their happy hour and you'll be a happy camper.

The place was practically empty so the reason for the food taking 35 minutes to come out of the kitchen is beyond me. Our waitress, however, was OK. Mom ordered a cheeseburger, medium, and I ordered an appetizer combo. From the second our food was put down all I could look at were the greasy ""french fried onions"" on Mom's burger. They almost seemed to be dripping in grease...EEEWWW! Her french fries literally tasted like they were cooked the day before and left out on the counter. Then, onto my plate... when I bit into a ""crispy shrimp"" they were absolutely grease-logged. Took one bite of the chicken taco which tasted terrible and I couldn't even stomach trying to taste a boneless wing...I was disgusted.  We told the waitress about our issues and she promptly summoned the manager over. She was very sweet and apologetic. Thank you!  I do not want to blame anyone for this grotesque experience except for the people in the kitchen. Having worked as a waitress for many years, I can only imagine what's going on back there...
