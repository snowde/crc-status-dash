Sean D.,"Northborough, MA",11,90,3,2.0,7/9/2011,"I only went here because someone who doesn't know me very well gave me a gift card, and lord was it not wonderful. The service was inattentive and got, my drink wrong and the response was a shrugged shoulder.  You know you are in a chain when the choice of doneness on your burger is pink or not pink. I ordered pink, obviously they got this way wrong ass the poor burger looked like the put it under a 40 pound grill weight and mashed every drop of juice out of it. The veggies on the burger were warm and wilty. Just not a good experience",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-millbury?start=20
Britta O.,"Grafton, MA",63,29,2,2.0,8/16/2011,"Applebees USED to be a ""go-to"" place for chain restaurants at the Shoppes at Blackstone in Millbury, MA but not so much anymore. At least ... NOT SINCE I GOT FOOD POISONING THERE!!! I only went there because I was meeting a friend for drinks and a little nosh. I ordered the sliders without the onions (as I am allergic). I ordered mash potatoes instead of the fries (because they make the fries in the same oil as the onion rings). What I got was super burnt sliders WITH onions and the sauce (which I asked NOT to have) and fries. I reminded the waitress of the whole ""death by onion"" thing and she actually had the nerve to look put out!  Other than the companionship, which was frickin' awesome, the place was awful. Never ... never again. subpar food. expensive for what you get. totally not worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-millbury?start=20
Ali S.,"San Antonio, TX",6,203,61,5.0,10/19/2013,Been here twice and both the times had great experience. The service and food both were great and I love there deals which make things really affordable. Will come back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-millbury?start=20
Tom D.,"Peabody, MA",57,305,11,2.0,7/26/2009,"Applebee's has long been at the bottom of my list of favorite chain restaurants and this latest venture really didn't do anything to bump it up a notch.  Let's start with the positives.  The server we had was very nice.  He was efficient with order taking and drink refilling, and reassured us that our orders were not forgotten when things in the kitchen got a little slow.  He also informed us that this location currently hosts trivia and karaoke nights, neither of which I've been to, but not something I'd expect to see at an Applebee's.  Kudos to the management here for doing something to liven up the scene at an otherwise very so-so chain. And now for the not-so-positives.  The decor is not exactly classy, but it's not as tacky as some comparable eateries.  The walls here are plastered with framed movie posters and the like.  I appreciate that they didn't make it a sports theme, as there are already enough pseudo sports bars out there.  And unlike at other similar restaurants, I also appreciate that I didn't have the constant fear of being take from this Earth by a giant piece of Americana striking me dead as it plummets from its precariously placed mount on the wall above my table.    The other not-so-positive, as you may have guessed, was the food.  I've never been too keen on Applebee's, but I'm a glutton for punishment and always willing to give something a second chance.  Plus, this is where my friend wanted to go and I cave easily.  Anyways, I decided to be trendy and order the cheeseburger sliders.  Honestly, unless you're going to give me a trio of different types of burgers to try, I see no point in sliders, but they're popular on menus now so I figured why not give them a shot?  Well, these three things were kind of gross.  They definitely had that fresh-from-the-microwave taste.  I don't know how to describe the taste of microwaved hamburger, but something happens during that two minute bombardment of radiation that ruins the taste of a burger.  Whether my sliders were actually microwaved or not, I cannot say, but that's what they tasted like.        Sadly, Applebee's, you get two stars.  You're not deplorable, so I'm not going to vow never to return, but I'm definitely not going to seek you out of my own volition.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-millbury?start=20
Nathen S.,"Westborough, MA",1,85,1,1.0,5/9/2011,"My eleven year old complained..... that's how bad the food was. Over-salted food. A stale hot dog roll. A lettuce filled chicken fajita roll-up...think they forgot the chicken. Overall a horrible meal for 4 of us. The only positive was the server, she was great. The star is for her because the food was a 0!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-millbury?start=20
Steve B.,"Sutton, MA",0,8,,1.0,11/26/2011,I just simply hate this place.  Food is disgusting.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-millbury?start=20
Busy L.,"Methuen, MA",3,332,1,3.0,7/7/2011,"Was pleasantly surprised going to this restaurant.  Have had 2 horrible experiences at previous Applebee's but my nephew likes this Applebee near his home and wanted to go here for his birthday dinner.  Who am I to deny that on his birthday? Everyone at the party was happy with what they got.  Appetizers arrived and was tasty and fresh.  Entrees were all good.  Compared to other similar chain restaurants, this location of Applebee's was actually quite decent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-millbury?start=20
Rachel B.,"Millbury, MA",13,2,4,1.0,6/17/2010,"Where do I start? When Applebee's in Millbury first opened, my boyfriend and I went to try it out. I have never been a big fan of Applebee's but he was so we decided seeing as how it's a new place, it might be better on service. We waited 30 minutes before the waitress came over. She apologized over and over for ""forgetting about us."" Either way, my boyfriend bought a wrap sandwich, took a bite and a very LARGE piece of tinfoil was wrapped up in the sandwich.  They gave us the SANDWICH for free, not the entire meal, which should have happened in a situation like that.  Last night, my boyfriend and I decided to give it another try due to their deal of 2 meals and an appetizer for $20. While we were waiting for our food, the couple behind us complained about something. I couldn't make out what it was exactly, but the waiter said, ""oh my god...that's not supposed to happen. Wow. Let me get my manager."" Once the manager came out, he said, ""I have never seen anything like that, I don't even know what to say."" Granted I have no idea what was being discussed other than it had something to do with the customer using his knife to cut his food...which is all I could make out.  My boyfriend and I got our food, which was actually very good. I got the 3 cheese chicken penne. Upon returning home and going to sleep, I woke up feeling sick to my stomach and spent most of the night in the bathroom. I ate nothing after applebees. I would NEVER return to that place. The ONE thing about Applebees that I enjoy, is that the waiter's are always very, very nice and always make sure we have what we need.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-millbury?start=20
Jay R.,"Worcester, MA",1,26,4,1.0,9/8/2012,Tried the blackened tilapia and it was delicious. Good news stops there. I live near this applebees and loved it when they first opened. Now its a joke. Prices are hefty considering the bird food sized portions. Its like every time i come here they find a new way to skimp. Boneless chicken breast are tiny and cost too much. Call me a fatty but 7 nuggets isnt worth $10. Appetizer my foot! Even my blondie dessert was a dissapointment. This will be my last time going to an applebees.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-millbury?start=20

Sharon V.,"Quincy, MA",437,374,1426,3.0,2/26/2017,"I sat at the bar with some friends. The bartender Jose was super duper nice.  As for the food, my Fiesta Lime Chicken had way too much cheese on it.  It was like would you like some chicken with your cheese?  I know it's a chain restaurant and not a five star socialite restaurant, but you can def tell the chicken was just microwaved.  I could of gave it to my dog as a chew toy. The restaurant itself is very clean and they do make a nice cocktail!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-millbury
Nishitha S.,"North Grafton, MA",252,36,7,4.0,5/4/2017,"Pretty surprised at all the crappy reviews! My mom and I dropped by here on a weekday for lunch (our first Applebee's experience). She ordered the lemon chicken dish and I got the chicken tender mac and cheese.  The portions were great. Not a huge plate like most chain restaurants. We both finished our meals with our stomachs content. The food came SUPER fast (kind of weird cuz that makes me think about how/ when it's made), but it was delicious! I docked a star because their dishes are not at all customizable and if a dish on the menu has bacon, then you'll get bacon. But again this is a chain restaurant.  The / / mac and cheese combo went together better than expected. Oh and we also got the onion rings for the app and they were AMAZINGLY crispy and hot and not overly greasy. Best onion rings I've had in a while.  I guess the time to come is middle of the day on a weekday folks!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-millbury
Jared G.,"Millbury, MA",0,9,,4.0,11/22/2017,I go here all the time love it had few issues but thats all everybody makes mistakes i get that. Very friendly staff and very fast. Also loved the drinks they made us,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-millbury
Casz M.,"Worcester, MA",69,24,53,4.0,5/17/2017,Steak was very well done. The garlic mash are always a fav for me and they have always made it great. My first time having their Mac and cheese but it was cheesy goodness.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-millbury
A K.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,13,21,1.0,4/9/2017,O wow... just peaked at some of the reviews. Most of em are 1-2 star reviews ... but I can definitely relate.  ... #1 problem is BOH: food comes out way tooooooo slow and nasty (especially the rubbery chicken): ordered the 2/$25 deal and the appt came an hr after then the food came out 1/2 hr after (have pictures with the times taken to prove it)  All the chicken orders came out tasting rubbery and dry. The skillet was not even hot.. Everything were extra salty ..  ... #2 problem is service: he never introduced us to him but saw his name on the receipt.. name is Thomas. He literally came by 3 times... one to take the order.. 2nd cuz we flagged him down for another drink.. 3rd for the check.. (never even asked for desserts but figured it was going to take another hr so Whatever) we wanted to pay by card but because he wasn't coming back.. we left him all the cash we had.. Either he doesn't know how to take several tables at once or he just purposely was avoiding us... not sure but it was pretty bad.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-millbury
Nikki N.,"Worcester, MA",11,91,54,1.0,6/13/2016,"My friend and I got the Fiesta Lime Chicken meal from here. My chicken was super rubbery and got me sick after the first bite. They offered to make me a new meal and it came out still rubbery and decided that it was time to go home. The manager offered me a free dessert which was nice, but overall the food was terrible. Applebee's is ONLY good for appetizers and drinks, other than that you should probably stay away from any of the chicken dishes if you care about your health.  The dishes and tables were still dirty.  Our waiter was nice and patient, but he was just annoyed as me throughout this experience. I won't be coming back here any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-millbury
Jacqueline K. D.,"Milford, MA",36,3,,1.0,4/30/2017,Came here for a drink with my bf he got a couple shots then a drink I got one shot then proceeded to wait and wait while the bartender played cards with her co workers! Then about ten mins later we had to flag her down and ask for another drink when she told my bf he couldn't have another because they have a 3 drink max. She should've told us that in the beginning!

Brad L.,"Auburn, MA",0,4,,1.0,4/15/2017,Was sat right away and felt like we were a mirage Sat in The middle of the bar room. A waiter seemed as though he was gonna present himself to the table but got caught up helping people he knew that came in well after us... no one came over our whole time of staying at almost 20 min there. We left and walked next door for a great meal. Could not believe how bad the service was. I'd recommend everyone to go next door to T.G.I. Friday's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-millbury
Warren L.,"Worcester, MA",39,143,919,4.0,5/31/2015,"We ate here at lunch time.  Everything was AOK.  Service was speedy, kitchen was OK, food was OK.  I personally dislike Velveeta style cheese, which is what they used on my burger (Brew Pub Philly).  I prefer cheese that's not in liquid form.  Although we try to avoid chain restaurants as we like local color, for a chain restaurant, I would recommend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-millbury

Jesse D.,"Caribou, ME",95,345,149,1.0,9/10/2015,"It was bad. I went twice (an error I know) because I kind of forgot how awful it was. Other the two trips five meals were ordered, two total were correct, and two total were sent back (one was incorrect but the person made due). The food is pretty standard chain fare but they tend to botch it, over or under cooking it. They also are somehow consistently out of whatever it is you want to order, three times in our two trips people had to go with a second choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-millbury

Annie R.,"South Grafton, MA",72,3,,1.0,2/25/2016,"Had a horrible experience with this Applebees last night. The drinks weren't even good, I got a patron margarita all I tasted was the magarita mix and no patron. Then the waitress I had let me bring it back and gave me a skinny magarita, in this drink all I tasted was soda. Then the dinner came out, I got the quesadilla burger, it wasn't even cooked through completely. And when we were leaving out the door, they didn't even say ""thank you for coming"" (as they usually do). I'm very disappointed because I've gone here before plenty of times and never had a problem. The night shift needs a change big time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-millbury

Scotty B.,"Southbridge, MA",19,1001,2088,3.0,7/18/2011,"This was the first time that we've been to this particular Applebees, and we weren't really that impressed. With all of the other choices in this shopping center, we will probably eat elsewhere the next time.  Our server, Sam, was friendly, very personable, and attentive for the most part but left us out on an island for a while.  Mrs B had the Chicken Fajita Wrap which tasted good but the ratio of lettuce to chicken was heavily tilted to the lettuce I decided to live on the wild side and tried the new Stuffed Chicken Parmesan was weird. The fettuccine came with a creamy Alfredo sauce and was topped with chicken with a marinara sauce. They both tasted good but should not have been on the same plate. I left with a bit of a queasy stomach, probably from the weird mix.  The other thing i could gave done without is the staff talking about each other in front of the patrons. If you want to talk about each other, have a blast, just go do it somewhere out of hearing distance from the customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-millbury
Matthew P.,"Blackstone, MA",0,16,1,4.0,11/22/2014,"So I'm not usually an Applebee's fan. Which is why the 4 instead of 5 stars. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised today. Took my daughter out for daddy daughter date after figure skating and this was her choice. Was greeted warmly, seated fast and Stephani our server was awesome. Had our drinks in less than 2 minutes. Food was very good, which surprised me. Grilled chicken wasn't dry which it almost always is at these types of places. Service was so good the manager brought my daughter a spoon for her yogurt because he noticed that she didn't have one. I will definitely come back here again next time my daughter asks for Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-millbury
Nicole L.,"Worcester, MA",27,331,174,3.0,9/15/2012,Well they redeemed themselves slightly after this visit. The server was perfect- timely with meals refills and very social. The spinach artichoke dip was good. Not a  huge fan anymore as they always taste the same.  The Cajun shrimp pasta was very spicy - yum. I live to actually taste the food.  Portions were good. It was a meal deal with 2 entree and appetizer for $20. Reasonable price but they charge for ice tea refill.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-millbury
