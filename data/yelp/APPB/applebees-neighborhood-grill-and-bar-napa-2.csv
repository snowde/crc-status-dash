Adam S.,"Vallejo, CA",21,3,,5.0,8/5/2017,As long as Jordan is my bartender everything is great because she makes sure of it. She always checks to see if our food is good and makes sure it comes out in a timely manner.

Jordan W.,"San Francisco, CA",45,12,6,1.0,9/29/2017,"This was the absolute worst dinner I've ever had here at Applebee's. I'll start off right away by saying that we didn't even get our appetizers, we waited and waited and finally our entrees come out and we're sitting there with a dumbfounded look on our face... So what about our appetizers? Next my wife bit in to her dinner and she deliberately stated that she didn't want any spice, her whole meal was covered in spice, she couldn't even eat it without feeling sick. My food was good enough, but the mashed potatoes were cold and she didn't even bring steak sauce. Finally we told the manager and she did nothing, she was rude and disrespectful, so we asked to talk to the General Manager Clemente... He was far worse! He didn't do anything except stand there and say. ""I don't know what to tell you"" our entire meal should have been compensated for such a blatantly disgusting use of customer service.  Steer clear of Applebees, you can always go just a bit further into American Canyon or Vallejo and find something there. It's not worth it coming here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-napa-2
Lily W.,"Napa, CA",110,172,34,3.0,11/30/2017,"Often quite busy in the late evenings (when many other local spots are closed or about to close), there's usually at least a moderate wait to be seated.  On weekdays, there seems to be a shortage of servers since there are usually plenty of tables open, but the line by the door is still pretty long.  Food and service is average as expected of a chain restaurant, but the servers are always polite!  Restaurant is clean with an abundant menu available.  I often crave the spinach-artichoke dip, which is admittedly quite salty, but it hits the spot!

The waitress was kind enough and brought an ice cream Sunday but was sorry to say her manager doesn't  allow time to sing happy birthday anymore. I told her that's why we came here tonight the applebees in other cities still do so. She brought over the ice cream and sang with us. Great waitress poor manager customer service !

Everyone's finished their drinks almost twice over. Don't even seem to see any food going out to anyone anywhere near us. This is beyond sad. Update: appetizers served after 70 minutes followed immediately by our main course. No real time in between. 2 of our dishes had missing items. Final update: I'm now home puking my guts out.

Jim E.,"Redondo Beach, CA",30,626,,5.0,10/3/2016,"What 5 stars for Applebee's Well yes and no, Applebee's gets 3 stars for the food, the extra 2 stars are because they supported special Olympics on the night we were there with the Tip a Cop fundraiser. We walked in and the place was full of cops, City cops, Highway Patrol, County Sheriff at least one from every jurisdiction in the area. The cops help the staff, serve the customer, some were better at it than others but they took time out of their evening to support special Olympics and give more to the communities they serve and make a difference with a very good cause.

After 15 minutes of waiting in my car I walked in and told them my situation. ( actually the guy in the car next to me did, he was waiting just as long as me and was frustrated as well) My food wasn't even done yet so I waited a bit longer. One of the managers said that they would do something about my check and give me a discount for waiting. A new manager came back with a $5 off coupon if I spend $25 or more for next time.... I'm not a huge complainer but I feel like that situation wasn't resolved the right way.

Shylene L.,"Napa, CA",63,16,,3.0,10/11/2017,"We went in last night at 1045. A full hour and a quarter until close. It was not busy at all. There were probably three servers for ten tables. Our server was disinterested. It took him ten minutes to even greet our table. Drinks took another 15 and two came melted (they were frozen) and the one strawberry ""dolarita"" we ordered cam regular flavor. When we flagged down our server to tell him, he took it to the bar, put a couple pumps of strawberry in it and brought it back to the table without even stirring it. When our dinner came out my daughter and I ordered the Bourbon Street chicken and shrimp. This dish is touted to have crispy potatoes sauteed onions and mushrooms chicken and shrimp. The ""crispy potaoes"" we're stuck together and not seasoned properly. Everything else was over seasoned and super salty, and there were absolutely no mushrooms anywhere on the plate. Now, I could understand this being a possible problem in the middle of a dinner rush. Unfortunately, this was not a dinner rush. The restaurant was nearly empty, and we are in the middle of a natural disaster. We had all had a long drawn-out day number 2 of the Napa fires and just really wanted to relax and have a nice meal. Our host who sat us was amazing.

Linda W.,"Napa, CA",9,108,,5.0,3/13/2017,"Yes, 5 stars for Applebees!  Living in Napa Valley can be very hard to afford going out to dinner.  They have some great food if you know what to order.  The quesadilla burger is amazing!  Really.  Compares to ANY high class restaurant....And believe me, we've been to them all!  We always start with a wedge salad with their green goddess dressing...so good.  Ask for the dressing on the side since they tend to put too much on.  The candied pecans, bacon bits and blue cheese crumbles add just the amount of salty sweet goodness!  We always share one and Applebees is so nice to split it and give us our own plates!  If the fries are fresh, they are so yummy and flavorful...I think they put crack in them!  Lol.  Oh!!!  And get the chicken wonton tacos! Those were little, crunchy bites of heaven! All of their drinks are too sweet for me, but if you get a gin and tonic you will be happy. Last week we had Brian as our server.  Greatest smile in Napa!!!  His whole face lights up!  He was super attentive, friendly and hospitable.  And to top all of this off, I left my MasterCard there. If you've ever lost your credit card you know that horrible feeling you get in your gut. A couple days later I realized maybe it was at Applebee's where I left it.  I called right away and the manager said it was in the safe!

I called the manager and she hung up on me. Way to handle it there manager! Now I know why this place is so bad. She could've solved my problem immediately with a to go drink! Duh! UPDATE I received a call from a regional manager named Ryan. He seemed very concerned about my bad visits to this restaurant and heard what I had to say.

Yosh H.,"Napa, CA",4,4,1,1.0,12/12/2016,"Alright, let me just start with saying that the Applebee's Menu is absolutely barren. I have memories of there being a lot more on the menu, what gives? My dad and I went in here this evening and we had an atrocious experience. We ordered our appetizers and were seated rather quickly, but I couldn't find a damn thing to order beyond that. I decided to settle on the Fish and Chips. Our Appetizer came quickly, which was about 7 chicken tenders covered in buffalo sauce masquerading as wings. Don't get me wrong, they were tasty, but this is probably the only good part of the meal, as it all went downhill from there. When the fish and chips arrived, it looked fine at first. I bit into the fish and chips, and, it was fine. At first. The further I proceeded into the fish, the flavor immediately died, and the entire fish had essentially fallen flat. Thinking it may only be this one, I bit into the other one's midsection. Same problem. They hadn't cooked any of them thoroughly enough to get the flavor in. The fries were fine, but they're fries, it's hard to mess that up. After my lackluster meal was complete, I decided to have dessert. I had a Hot Fudge Meltdown, which is also known as lava cake and a scoop of ice cream. The server warned me, however, that they had no hot fudge, which immediately baffled me. They would be able to serve me a CAKE, but had no ability to make FUDGE HOT. Don't they microwave all of their food before sending it out, regardless? The food aside, there were other things that were strange and confusing about this evening were the way that service was done. There were no napkins. Anywhere. There were no dispensers to obtain napkins. We had to ASK for napkins. And what napkins we got were essentially drink coasters. Thin, little measly pieces of paper. We also had to ask for silverware, which didn't even come with our food in the first place. Speaking of the food, it was all in strangely small portions? None of this would justify to me that our meal would be worth 65 dollars. Will not be going again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-napa-2?start=20

When I received my bill the amount was correct, as it only charged us for two entrees. However, after they ran my credit card they had added a third entree and increased the amount to reflect that. After pointing this out they brought out a different bill with a different check number to reflect the correct amount.

We had a waiter our orders were ALL wrong... took a long time for our orders to come out and we ordered salads... he wasn't really around and he seemed nervous and just not with it. Maybe the kitchen was short staffed but we had my grandmother with us who has a dietary restriction and we said to leave out the corn off the salad and guess what there was corn... my salad had dressing on the side and I didn't ask for that.. and unfortunately it was overdressed..... the soup i got was warm.. not hot....

First off the manager - rather than a server - served us our drinks, then it took a while for another person to take our order. Our food arrived 10 minutes longer than expected, and was disappointed with the presentation  and quality  of the food. We order the two samplers, and were charged individually for each, rather than the ""2 for $10""(?), which costs $5 more. Of course we complained, and received a 50% discount on those items.

I've never had bad service but I have had a cold order of boneless buffalo wings and a really tough steak that looked and tasted like a hockey puck.

Misty S.,"Napa, CA",62,8,3,1.0,5/4/2016,"If there were an option for no stars - That would be our pick; hopefully this review gets attention as the online contact us page was not working yesterday or today so Yelp it is! We just left this establishment very unhappy (5/3/16 8:35-9pm). Our server took forever to get us our drinks, had awkward conversation and never tended to us. We waited and waited for about 15 mins to place our order, then we were going to attempt to use the machine at the table but was giving her the benefit of the doubt when my husband hit the ""page server"" when she was bringing another table stuff she then finally asked if we were ready. Wee then ordered our app buffalo wings and mozz sticks ribs and the philly. After 20 more mins another person brought the cold food. Whilst this was happening my husband finally scopes out the manger who looked straight back at him, never came to our table - he was talking to an employee who had her food eating at a side table. After he looks back he ends up bringing a table other than ours ( our drinks were empty) another refill and still never made his way over in the very unpacked restaurant and this table he visited was two tables away from us, same section. Mind you after making eye contact with my husband. My husband ended up having to go up to the mngr Marc, explain the situation how he felt disrespected and didn't accept the comp meal based on the service he was overseeing and providing. We both have worked in customer service with pride for over 10yrs so we know good, great, poor and really bad service.

Susan T.,"Napa, CA",1,30,2,1.0,12/29/2016,"Last Tuesday night we wanted to have dinner at Applebee's before going to the movie theater.  We arrived one hour before showtime thinking that we'd just order a hamburger, then hop over to see our movie (a couple blocks away).  We were seated within 5 minutes, but, had to wait for another 10 minutes to get a menu.  We both ordered the 'American Standard' hamburger with cheddar cheese (instead of American cheese) and water.  The water arrived right away, but, it took 35 minutes for our food to arrive.  The waiter put the plates down and left.  We had 8-10 minutes to eat and there was no silverware on our table - aaaaaannnd...there was no waiter to be seen!  Then, we looked at the plates.  On the plate was a basic hamburger (not at ALL what we ordered) with American cheese and nothing else on the top or even on the side.  The fries weren't even warm.  We frantically flagged down the waiter who seemed completely overwhelmed) to tell him what was going on.  His response was, ""let me look at your order"" (while he was digging to find what he wrote down). He was insinuating that I ordered the wrong thing.  We were so disgusted, we just got up and left.  We had a gift card to use but are unsure if we EVER want to go back.

Amanda C.,"Napa, CA",1,2,,1.0,2/16/2016,"For my birthday dinner, all I wanted was this salad from Applebee's. I love the Asian chicken salad, so I thought I'd give them a chance since we quit going there a few years ago due to bad service. I placed the order online and the site crashed multiple times. After twenty minutes, I finally got it through. The meal was to be ready for pick up at 6. At 6:05 my husband pulled up and waited in the designated parking spot. After 5 more minutes, he went in and asked about our order. They said,""oh, just two more minutes."", he went back to the car to wait and get back to the kids. 10 more minutes later, they finally come with the food. Once home, we distribute the food only to realize that none of the 7 drinks were there. (He didn't know I had ordered any.)  At this point, he gets really irritated. Between the food not being ready on time, the unprofessional service, and now part of our $75 order missing, he had enough. After explaining the situation, the manager offered a $15 gift card. There is no way I'm going in there again. Even with the gift card. Why would I want to put myself in a frustrating situation again? It's not worth it.  To make it even worse, as my husband was on the phone with the manager, I took a bite of my much anticipated birthday salad and got a mouthful of plastic! A big chunk of a plastic bag was mixed into my salad. I'm glad it wasn't a finger or something worse, but still...

Last night we went in hoping to see Linda but she wasn't there. After a full day of cleaning up after the earthquake we are hungry and tired. And need something small and quick.  We originally sat in a booth and the waiter walked by us 4 times without saying anything so we decided to go to the bar to get better service. What a mistake!!!  The bartender name brian, wearing an orange shirt was the worst service I have ever gotten at a bar- period. I mean you have one job - Fill drinks, get food orders, and stay behind the bar. If You are in the weeds with 8 patrons sitting at the bar, you shouldn't have a job. Ive work in restaurants for years. If someone is trying to talk to you to ASK for service then you have FAILED. I know when I'm being ignored on purpose. When I asked for waters and it takes 5minutes to get them while he went to someone who ordered AFTER me and make them a drink just annoyed me. (Hint: It is noticeable) it is a bar. Your moves are on display. He couldn't even bus the dirty used glasses off the bar nor did he say thank you or your welcome. Shitty attitude with shitty service.

Seph V.,"Temecula, CA",0,4,,1.0,8/14/2015,"Had a terrible dining experience here. We came for happy hour drinks and appitizers. The food was fine and our second server Amy was kind (although she ordered us a $9 dollar lemon drop martini instead of the $4 lemon drop shot, however the extra cost was removed from our bill.) To start we ordered 3 jeager bombs and 3 kamikazi. They brought 6 glasses out and our fist server maxi said they were the jeager bombs. Literally every other applebees and every other bar for that matter comes with a glass with the red Bull and a shot glass full of jeager however these were just glasses. Jeager bombs come with two parts so we assumed they were to be mixed and then drank. We waited for the 3 kamikazi we ordered and eventually asked where it was since maxi never came back with a second drink. The manager a thin woman with long dark hair then very rudely and aggressively came up to our table and said she ""knew for a fact that we got two drinks already"" as if accusing us of lying and trying to get free drinks! When we tried to explain we thought the two glasses were for the jeager bomb she condescendingly told us their chain doesn't allow for them to have people drop the shot in because the glass could break therefor their jeager bomb comes premixed. Like I said no applebees or bar I've been to does that they all have plastic cups for the shot. On their menu they even have a picture of the red plastic shot glass that goes with a jeager bomb. If I had know that we wouldn't have ordered it period yet they offered no apology, they didn't remove the drinks from our bill, and they were aggressive and rude on top of that so we had a ruined jeager bomb/ kamikazi mashup. It was only a misunderstanding but the manager was extremely rude to us and the entire experience was bad because of her.

I mainly come in to decompress after a hard day. Their mozzarella sticks leave much to be desired. Their spinach/artichoke dip was overly greasy from the cheese. Their burgers are good -- standard fare. And I did try their orange chicken: Crispy, the way I like it. But I also happen to be the type of person who likes my food drowning in orange sauce. If I were to order again, I will ask for more sauce. I don't drink, so I can't say much for their alcohol. But I did like how their ""perfect margaritas"" come with their shaker containers. My friends love their beers on tap. I had a plain lemonade on a hot day , so that was refreshing. I am embarrassed for all of the birthday greetings the wait staff has to do when there is one. I don't come for the food, but for the people I'm with. And when we're happy, that's what counts.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-napa-2?start=80

Ed R.,"Livermore, CA",0,6,,1.0,2/21/2015,"My review is not based on food nor food service, but on policy. I work close by and usually bring my lunch to work. Recently I forgot my lunch and briefcase and decided to enjoy a more leisurely lunch break with a more substantial lunch. After entering the bar area and being ignored for five minutes by a bartender who was engaged in a heated discussion with the ""regulars"" about a construction project, I ordered a beer. I was told I needed an I.D. I am 64 years old... I look 64 years old... I act 64 years old...I did two tours of duty in Viet Nam... My wallet was in my briefcase, so a half hour away at home. Yes, I was told it was a ""policy"" to require identification. Yes, it is not the bartender's fault, but there should be some reasonable application of this policy. I left the restaurant, deciding to vote on this policy and treatment with my lunch dollars and will not return, nor will I recommend it to anyone (I work in a hotel close by and am often asked to recommend easy,convenient restaurants). In fact, as a cranky 64 year old who could have probably USED a beer, I will also expressly tell people to NOT go to Applebee's.

Let's breakdown the visit. Our server didn't introduce herself, asked for our beverages and didn't see her for 15 min. Let's set the plot, literally 3 families dining at this time, 3:30 pm. Brought our drinks which wasn't completed due to her forgetting some drinks. She took our order. We requested from our table device, service to refill beverages which didn't happen. Our food comes. A member of our group didn't receive her dinner salad she ordered and our waitress excuse was  ""oh someone should've brought that..."" Really! I believe that is your sole purpose... Doesn't refill our beverages after two different requests, oh and there is food in front of us but there are no napkins nor silver wear which was requested prior of the food arrival. We had to request silver wear once more to start eating. While she was bringing everyones food my wife asked for silver wear and her response was ""I'm trying to get everyone's food out first."" In a snappy tone. Our waitress had a horrible attitude and seemed inconvenienced by us choosing their establishment for my grandmothers 86th birthday because she loves Applebee's. Finally we get settled and she never asked how our food was, didn't refill our beverages but chose to talk about her personal life with other lackadaisical waiters which included cuss words. All of us were in ear shot of the conversation. All in all the service was the worst I have experienced. I received an apology from the manager and the excuse of that she was new. I will not be returning to this Applebee's and any Applebee's for that matter. Very disappointed. The servers name is Emma so if you get her section good luck. The hostess on the other hand was extremely helpful and accommodating her name was Kailey. I wish I could rate this establishment zero stars.

Kayla M.,"Napa, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/20/2013,"One star for the food being good, but the service was terrible. Our server took out drink order but forgot a water had to ask three times before my husband finally got his water. Our food came out pretty quickly but wasn't brought by our server an then our server never came back, everyone at the table needed refills and the only reason we got them was because we got up and asked a manager, even after that the manager told our server then our server came over and asked if we needed refills we said yes then a minute later the manager came back over and figured out what we were drinking, still the server didnt bring back anything. Then we waited again for the check for what seemed like forever and then had to wait again to get our cards picked up, when she never came back we just left cash and ran out, another table left at the sane time as us after waiting for the same server for over 30 minutes and never got there order taken",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-napa-2?start=100
Robert S.,"Sacramento, CA",2,16,,2.0,7/27/2010,"The service, food, and atmosphere are nearly the same at all Applebee's that I've been to. The only one worth mentioning was the one in Cameron Park, CA. I would go there once or more a week after classes to grab some wings and a beer and the bartender there was fantastic. Otherwise all Applebee's are meh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-napa-2?start=100

Chuck B.,"Palos Verdes Peninsula, CA",0,5,,1.0,6/23/2010,"Typical Applebees, pleasant waiters, decent service, but nearly everything was extremely salty.  It was as if the cook went crazy with the salt shaker. Out of nine dinners, seven were excessively salty--even the steaks!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-napa-2?start=100
Russ B.,"San Francisco, CA",18,100,20,4.0,6/28/2008,Ya know what it is Applebees........  They have a nice happy hour special after 9pm.  There is always a place at the bar and with TV's playing sports.  You can really tell that this is a place that the true napa locals hang out and eat.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-napa-2?start=100
