kozue a.,"Streamwood, IL",113,6,34,2.0,9/3/2017,"This was probably the worst  service we received in Niagara.  Our server Marie is either racist or has some kind of discrimination against non-caucasians or couples as we had to ask for coffee refills and couldn't even get a thank you out of her when she gave us a check while she was super friendly towards two older Caucasian ladies around her age that walked in. A different couple even walked out after ordering coffee.  This would usually earn a 1 star but other employees seem friendly and maybe she personally has problems. Anyone coming to Niagara,  be weary of certain individual's poor service.  As for the food, for the amount I paid,  I think fast food serves much tastier food and selection compared here. If anything,  this place should just stick to lunch and dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-niagara-falls-5
Drew M.,"Waterford charter Township, MI",108,30,14,1.0,7/2/2017,"Apple Bees is generally a safe bet when on vacation and looking for a quick bite to eat. Boy, were my boyfriend and I wrong when walking into this Apple Bees. The food tasted awful. I got a chicken fettuccini dish if some sort. The cheese tasted wrong, like it was not meant to be eaten.  Not only was the food awful, but the service was awful. We ended up sitting in this place for THREE HOURS. They were about busy because it was a Friday night and apparently some of the staff hadn't showed up. Ridiculous. We would have left immediately after tasting the food, but after giving them our card to pay, we hadn't seen our waitress for an hour. We were furious.

We stayed at The Oakes which is connected to the restaurant, and walked in with our breakfast vouchers, not sure exactly what to expect since in the US Applebee's doesn't do breakfast.  I had some of the best toast I've ever had in my whole entire life, the bacon was perfectly crisp, the potatoes were deliciously seasoned, and the sausages.  I typically don't eat sausage, but I ate the ones on my plate they were so good.  My one complaint is my eggs tasted old and dry, but other than that, it was very enjoyable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-niagara-falls-5

Price for a beer and steak for this quality was too high. I was the only guest at the bar and tried to have a conversation with the bartender...no chance. I was ignored. Interesting experience.

Decent surroundings and perhaps in a safe neighbourhood could be the reason one visits an Applebee's.  The food is definitely and unequivocally below par. However, my over easy eggs were cooked to perfection. The potatoes were fine. Unfortunately, if you can find the bacon, they were over baked. Too bad restaurants don't fry them anymore.

We were served by Jeff who reminded me of much revered capitalism which makes spending money fun in States. He even said to get out before 10pm fireworks to avoid traffic. Much appreciated man! Thanks if you're reading this. M'eh stuff: Built a sampler for $23.99 including Jerk Chicken Tacos, Thai Peanut Wings and Sriracha Shrimps. All good. Decent Margaritas. With a refill.

Brenda J.,"North Augusta, SC",0,8,,1.0,8/12/2017,I am thinking lately all Applebees should be shut down since they have no idea what customer service is.  We walked into a nearly empty restaurant and had to wait nearly an hour for food because there was only ONE waitress on the floor.  They had 3 or hostesses.  Why is that even necessary?? I asked the hostesses if anyone was working over than the one waitress and they responded that the rest of them was not OLD enough to serve food because they could not serve alcohol.  Why not actually employ people who can serve food since you are a restaurant?

You should've seen the look of disappointment on my dad's face, he was dying for it! If you have been to Applebee's and normally go for one specific food, I suggest first looking at the menu for this specific place to see if they have it, if it's not there, give them a call to find out.

Don't waste your money here. You will absolutely regret it.  Food- dry, over cooked and took an extremely long time to get out to tables.  Drinks-do not get anything that doesn't come in a bottle. We tried so hard to make this work. Ordered margaritas. Each component was bad. The alcohol was forgotten. Then we ordered two shots of tequila to add in, and the tequila was foul and also extremely watered down. It was sugar syrup in a cup with a few ice cubes and some salt around the rim.  Prices- atrociously high! Almost four times as much as a normal non tourist Applebee's .  Servers- the only reason this post didn't get a zero. The most terrible thing about this experience was the fact that the servers here were busting their butts running around to serve, greet, take care of customers and keep things going.

This time we used this coupon for couples.  My guess is that Applebee's here is owned by the Oakes hotel.  I basically felt like I was being punished because the Oakes tells me that I had a free breakfast with my stay and then when I go to Applebee's it's limited to two options which would somehow cost 20$  Since when does 3 eggs, 2 slices of brown bread, and potato cost 20$?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-niagara-falls-5?start=20

I ordered a burger from the menu (there was a lot of dishes to choose from but I ended up going with a burger) with a side of mashed potatoes. My girlfriend got the steak (9oz).

Charles R.,"Mississauga, Canada",14,120,4,3.0,2/17/2014,"On a recent Niagara Falls visit, we had the opportunity to dine at this Applebees for both Dinner and Breakfast the following morning.  We have dined at this location easily 15-20 times over the last 10 years. Dinner was after a day of sightseeing.  It was moderately busy and all the booths were taken so we had a table for our family of five.  I had the Santa Fe Chicken Salad.  For me it worked quite well.  Yum Yum.  Only downside that I have with most restaurant salads is that there was way too much dressing in it.  I should have asked for the dressing on the side and easily dropped 40% of the calories off of this 1200 calorie behemoth. I spent too much time coaxing my younger daughter to eat to notice what the rest of the family was eating.  The daughter had the kids pizza which tasted decent, based on the one bite that I had.  I know my son had Mac and Cheese, which disappeared quite quickly. The food is all standard fare.  We were happy Our server, L, (I won't say her full name) was awesome!  She dealt with the 1001 questions from my three year old daughter like a champ and still remained energetic around her. Breakfast we had J as a server.  We had two orders of pancakes, 1 of fruit loops, 1 omelette, and I had the french toast.  My wife liked her omelette.  My french toast was blase.  It was just bread, with egg wash.  Every chef, except the breakfast chef at Applebees, knows that you put cinnamon in French Toast. Though breakfast here was bland, at least they didn't try to financially rape me like the iHop down the street tried.  For that, we will continue to come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-niagara-falls-5?start=20

Kris U.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",2917,1220,3534,2.0,12/10/2012,"This review has been sitting in my queue for awhile and after avoiding it for sometime I decided to go forth and write it. Ok, so Applebee's this review isn't a reflection of your staff or service to me they were aces. This review is a reflection of your selection and quality of cusine when I visited several months ago for breakfast.  To clarify I used to live in Windsor, ON and I enjoyed many a lunch at the Applebee's there as well as the occasional dinner. Breakfast is certainly not your strongest suit. I had a standard bacon and eggs breakie with rye toast and to mee all but the eggs really fell flat. My request for soft bacon was ignored and I got crispy with a nice tan of black and the Rye toast was cold and saturated with butter (or butter spray - not sure). The over-sized portion of deep fried french fried potatoes didn't do very much to make up for anything either.  While the staff provided some great service, the cafeteria style breakfast felt mass prodced, overdone and with little care or attention. Hard to believe you were empty when we walked in....  My helpful hint: You've done great work with front of house, now time to whip your kitchen into shape. You're in a major tourist area, too many meals like this and people wont be back.

Seriously when I walked in, it just felt sad inside. Applebee's was right next to the Oakes Hotel we were staying at which meant less than a minute walking to get there. They advertised a $6.99 breakfast special on the sign so we headed on in. When we went in the waitress told us that people staying at the Oakes get 10% off, score! She gave us a breakfast menu with a page of way overpriced items all about $10 on it. The $6.99 special that lured us in was nowhere to be found on the breakfast menu. When I asked about it, she told us what it was, then seemed annoyed when I ordered it. Eh, okay? She wasn't very friendly the whole meal and then forgot to give us the 10% off. We didn't even bother reminding her, just paid our $21 bill (including tax & tip) and got the heck out of there! $6.99 is about as cheap as it gets for breakfast in the Falls, but to advertise it outside, then not on the menu, then get agitated when people order it...seems a bit shady to me!

Lady T.,"York, Canada",34,43,9,1.0,4/24/2011,"DON'T EAT HERE! This is the first bad review I've ever written. Usually, I ONLY feel compelled to write after a great dining experience but I must warn people abt this place. Maybe they know that since this is a vacation spot they will always have foot traffic and they don't have to care about attracting customers to come back.  I ate here with my boyfriend after walking around niagara to wait out the line up at the border to do some shopping in buffalo. When we walked in to this place it was dark and tired looking but we still decided to stay anyways. We were greeted and seated right away by the hostess. I ordered a Tropical Chicken Salad and the bf ordered a Asian noodle dish. The food took a long time to come and when it did I wished it hadn't. The salad wasn't made with fresh lettuce tasted like old iceberg and romaine lettuce from the discount rack, the balsamic dressing tasted just like pure white vinegar and the diced fruits were mushy and flavourless (how does anyone get fruit wrong?). The asian noodle dish was incredibly small that had we of measured it, it would have been at 1/2 cup in a measuring cup the green beans were a mushy dull green consistency like they've been recooked more than once. It was so bad that I had to wonder the only way u can get food this wrong. well I can only think that it almost seems deliberate. The whole time I was eating i just couldn't help but think i  could have gone to Wendy's for a chicken salad @ $8 that would haved tasted 10x better.  The experience felt like we were dining in a runned down nursing home where people deliberately send their hated parents. All in all the service was decent but whoever makes the food here have lost all passion as a cook.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-niagara-falls-5?start=60

I also ordered a cherry limonade that was sour as hell.  My son had teriyaki shrimp with noodles and there were hardly any noodles and no taste. The Oreo milkshake was good.

Alyssa B.,"ASTORIA, NY",188,245,137,3.0,12/3/2013,"I'm not a fan of Applebee's. Never have been and probably never will be. We ate breakfast here because it was conveniently attached to our hotel. They had all the basics.. eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, bread. The first day I ordered eggs over medium with 2 strips of bacon and wheat toast. It came with home fries. They actually cooked my eggs to order, which I think is a very rare thing when you order ""over medium,"" so kudos to the chef for that. The bacon and the toast were standard. My potatoes were seasoned well, but they weren't really cooked all the way through. The second morning I ordered the western, which is like an omelette sandwich. It was huge! and it was actually packed full of peppers, onions and cheese. The potatoes were actually cooked this time.  I wish they offered something a little healthier - such as egg whites, although i'm sure you can ask for that. Maybe a cup of fruit would be nice. Also, I would prefer real milk/cream with my coffee rather than those little plastic creamer cups.

I had the ribs and my friend have a steak and with no drinks the total was over seventy two dollars. Taxes paid a big role in that. The two taxes added a little over 19% to our bill plus the tip. Total rip off.

Niki B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",2,8,2,1.0,2/21/2016,"This is the worst experience I have ever had at Applebee's. I have eaten at multiple Applebee's and the staff here is the worst staff I have ever seen in a restaurant. First, the barback took our drink order because the bartender was too busy on her phone to notice that we had sat down at the bar, we were literally the only people there. On top of that once the barback told her our drinks, she still took 10 minutes to bring our drinks. We ordered mozzarella sticks; they took 20 minutes to come out. They were cold and tasted awful. The inside was cold and chunky like cottage cheese instead of stringy like it is supposed to be. It took us 10 minutes to get the bartenders attention because she was too busy socializing with her co-workers and gossiping loudly about person issues within the restaurant. Once we finally got her attention and described the issue, she simply said nobody else has complained so maybe it's just you. My boyfriend was pissed at this point; he asked to speak to the manager. After 10 more minutes of waiting the manager never came out. We cancelled our order and left. It was literally the worst dining experience I have ever had.

We have been to Applebee's in other locations many times for lunch or dinner and always enjoyed our food. Staff were friendly and the restaurant was clean. The restaurant must have a relationship with the Oakes Hotel next door as we were asked if we were guests (which we were not). We ordered omelettes and while they tasted ok, we were disappointed by the way they were made. It seemed that instead of mixing our options in, they had prepared a basic cheese omelette and then wrapped/folded this around the rest of the meat/veggies we requested (ie my husband had a whole strip of bacon in his vs bacon pieces). Not we expected for a $13 omelette. Had we known that this would be the case we would have picked something different off of the menu.

Fred S.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",0,32,113,1.0,11/26/2013,"Applebees at the Canadian Niagara Falls  - I'd read the bad reviews about Applebee's but took a chance since there're not a lot of good options at this tourist trap. The other area restaurants also have less than steller Yelp reviews too e.g. Ruth's Chris Steak House, Vinny's, etc all of which were within walking distance from the hotel. It's pretty obvious that the area businesses aren't counting on repeat customers.  Food quality - The food tasted so-so. Those of us that ate fried stuff didnt suffer but my son ate coleslaw and later served penance by kneeling before the porcelain god. Presentation - The presentation is unappealing and that's putting it charitably. Ambience - The interior looks better seen through the windows from the outside. Inside, the seats are uncomfortable and point source lighting over the tables were glaring instead of warm and mellow.  Service - Got seated promptly as the restaurant was relatively empty at dinner time. The service was basic, the server got us what we wanted and then left us alone, only checking back once. It took a while to pay and leave because none of the staff were to be found. Price - Poor value for money.  I'd rather spend $10 more per steak and have a better meal at The Keg (N.B. Didn't try the Keg at Niagara, went to the one in Calgary). Verdict- Fail. Visited on 14 Nov 2013.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-niagara-falls-5?start=40

It was nothing great.  I was not able to finish it even though i was really hungry.  My husband's order of short ribs was okay but the noodles that came with it fell short of his expectations.  Our aunt was not impressed with the noodle tower, she found it to be undercooked.  The appetizer sampler, the baby back ribs, and the cheeseburger were good though.  Moral of the story, when ordering, stick to their specialty.  Why did i even bother ordering a chinese dish in a place that specializes in grilled items? duh!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-niagara-falls-5?start=40
Karen S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",60,6,,4.0,6/27/2013,"We ate here before returning to the Oakes hotel.  It was probably a pretty typical Applebee's experience, which I feel is pretty important in this town because I thought many other restaurants were so expensive and served such low quality food in comparison to the ""normal"" locations.  This was pretty much what I'd expect from a family style chain.    The kids got your typical kids' meals -- 2 ordered pizza and 1 ordered mac and cheese.  The price (I believe it was about $5.99) included a drink and dessert.  The dessert choices would have been ice cream or chocolate pudding but unfortunately the were out of them.  The waitress offered applesauce as a replacement.  They weren't hungry after eating most of their dinners, so we declined.  If perhaps another more tempting dessert had been offered I'm sure we'd have accepted!   My husband and I ordered from the 2 for $25 menu.  We both got the Fiesta Lime Chicken and shared the Queso Blanco appetizer.  It was pretty good.  I will definitely try to replicate that chicken recipe at home.  We also each had a beer.   The plates were terribly hot -- not only an inconvenience but also a reminder that the food has been under heating lamps.  However, the food was tasty regardless.   The decor was typical Applebee's -- busy and bright.  The table was a little sticky -- clean but could probably use a refinishing.  The service was extremely friendly, attentive, and helpful. Again, this isn't fine dining but especially with the prices that reflected those outside a tourist district, we were pleased.  We'd definitely be open to coming again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-niagara-falls-5?start=40
