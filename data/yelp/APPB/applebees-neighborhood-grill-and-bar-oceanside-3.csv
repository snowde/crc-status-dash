I had an issue with online ordering which took 20 minutes and still wouldn't work and called to talk to the manager after waiting 5 minutes on hold, this would make it a whole hour from when I started to when I'll bring my food back home to my poor hungry hubby.

Allison W.,"Oceanside, CA",0,19,,5.0,4/2/2016,I had a horribly stressful day at work today. I wasn't excited to go to Applebee's but my friend insisted and I'm glad I caved. we sat at the bar and we had Jennifer and Keith. they were amazing! they looked like they were having so much fun and they included us in their fun. their enthusiasm really helped to make my night. they kept the drinks coming and were very accommodating and nice. they definitely turned my night around! I really appreciate how nice they were and we will definitely be coming back soon!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-oceanside-3?start=40
Katie S.,"Long Beach, CA",266,15,18,1.0,7/14/2015,"Let me start with this...I understand this is Applebee's, not a 5 star, high end restaurant. However, the lack of customer service at this location is horrendous and the food was ""eh"" at best. They sat us quickly, which was nice since we were here with my 89 year old grandmother.  Secondly, where my grandma was sitting, the sun was glaring straight into her eyes from one of the windows, so another server closed the blinds for us. So, we'll attribute the 1 star to those 2 things. To make a long story as short as possible, our server was anything but attentive. Our drinks would become completely empty before she would refill them and we had to ask most of the time. She wasn't helpful in recommending anything or guiding us through the menu (i.e. showing us where to find the drink options). Also, our food took almost 35 minutes - let's take into account the fact that we were one of 4 tables when we ordered and I'm pretty sure there were 4 servers on duty.  The food was fine, but definitely very small portions and did not look as pictured or described (much smaller in size). Also, we asked our server if they did anything for birthdays, since we were celebrating my grandma's birthday - she said yes, little did we know, they charge for the dessert - mentioning that to us would have been nice. My father asked to see a manager when the bill came mainly due to our food taking so long and that's when the server told us they were short staffed in the kitchen - she could have mentioned this/apologized for the delay due to this during the 35 minutes we waited for our salads and sandwiches. When the manager came out, he didn't even know which table he was supposed to be going to and just started approaching every table in our area before finally getting to us and realizing we were the ones that had requested to speak to him. He didn't introduce himself either, which just seemed unprofessional. He did apologize and said he would supply a discount, but didn't specify what that would be - no big deal, we appreciated that we would be getting a discount. Once we got the new bill, he told my mother that he had taken off one of the lunch specials (he picked the cheapest one out of our 6 meals) and the birthday dessert...this is when we found out they had planned to charge for this. It was a pretty cheap way to provide a discount as an apology for the complete lack of customer service. All in all, we left a very minor tip, will not be returning and wouldn't recommend that anyone waste their time or money at this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-oceanside-3?start=40

James G.,"Oceanside, CA",38,8,,5.0,6/23/2015,"Took the family here last week. We'd never been to this location before and that always makes me a bit nervous. The place was busy, which was a good sign, it was a week night. The hostess was very polite, if robotic. Our server was extremely friendly. He kept tabs on everything we needed, even cracked a few jokes, and was very attentive. The restaurant and tables were clean. I had the Fish and Chips, which was delicious, and a rather large portion for the price. My wife had sizzlin' chicken fajitas, which were to the normal good standard. Mozzarella sticks and green beans for a starter to share, those were so tasty. The kids had there usual butter pasta and healthy vegetable snacks with juice and milk deal. We finished off with a nice ice cream sundaes to share. great value with service to match. All in all this was a great place to be, at least on a weeknight. I don't know what weekend staff is like, or how busy it would be.

Rob P.,"Jacksonville, NC",70,289,241,2.0,3/29/2014,"Had lunch here today, the table was still dirty so my wife had to use a baby wipe to clean it off ourselves.  Waited almost 15 minutes before anyone came to take our drink order.  I ordered the trio appetizer and it would be nice if they made even half of an attempt to make the food look like the picture.  My boneless wings were luke warm and could tell that they just through them in a microwave.  The chicken wongtons were drowning in a weird coleslaw, and to top it off, the southeast egg rolls were not egg rolls at all, instead a smear of small steak pieces with tons of cheese in a TORTILLA!! Then someone half attempted to make it look like an egg roll by cutting it diagonally.  Oh and that was also microwaved.  I would have sent it back, but at this point we had already waited 45 minutes.   I used to love coming to Applebee's to catch a game on tv with some nice beers and a trio appetizer, but this location has gone down hill real fast.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-oceanside-3?start=40

Sauce was too salty for my taste. The onion and mushroom side was pitiful. It didnt deliver like the ""picture"" on the menu. On the picture, you can actually see mushrooms.

Oliver V.,"Henderson, NV",21,11,1,1.0,11/21/2016,For ALL the people that read reviews before going to a spot to spend money. This ONE is for you. So I came here to Applebee's for their food and decent service. Well not this one. Me and my family came in from Las Vegas and we were greeted fairly quickly. As we sat down the hostess told us VANESSA will be our server. So we waited about 20 min before water was out then ordered our food. I was about to leave but i realized there was only two servers so I understood the situation. Food was decent but what put the icing on the cake and sealed the deal about NEVER coming to this location before was when I asked for to go box and waited about 10 min then finally asked the hostess to get one for me. When I passed the server she had no idea that I was waiting for to go boxes. Not once she apologized for taking a while to get our orders and that she forgot to get me my to go box. So I hope people won't experience what I did but much goodness at least say sorry or acknowledge the fact that you're taking a long time for SHIT to be done.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-oceanside-3?start=40

We arrived and were told that it was about a 15 minute wait to be seated, which I am used to because I understand how busy they can become at sometimes.  The problem was that there where about 10 tables that were open and available for customers.   After about 10 minutes of waiting, we were finally taken to a booth.  I had to make eye contact with our server 3 times, over a 5-7 minute period, before he stopped at our table to take our order.  We decided to order a couple drinks from the bar as well. Another 10 minutes passed and we still did not have our drinks from the bar or even the water that we ordered.  We heard another couple behind us complaining of the same thing so I turned around and asked them how long they had been waiting.  To my surprise they said they had been waiting almost 15 minutes for their bill and that they had asked to speak with a manager. We decided to get up and leave the restaurant because after almost 30 minutes of walking in the door, we still had not received anything.  When I got to the car, I contacted the restaurant and spoke with a manager over the phone because I felt like i should explain myself as to why we left after ordering and before receiving our meal.  He did apologize and told me that they are understaffed at the moment. I wish I could write a review on the food, but I didn't have an opportunity to try it.  Good Luck to anyone that decides to venture here.

Im the adult daughter so of course Dad told me to go in and see how long the wait was. I didn't understand that there was a table outside calling out numbers, so I asked the hostess inside how long the wait was. She said ""well I don't know. We're not telling people how long it is going to be"" without any further explanation without me pressing her. She acted fairly rude to be honest, however I understand it was really busy and I'm sure I wasn't the first person to come in and ask which can be frustrating. (However she was much nicer when we finally got seated). I went outside to get us a number, and the outside hostess who was very nice told me it would probably be a 45 minute wait which was really no problem seeing as we were trying to go to Olive Garden before, and had been told that it was at least a 2 hour wait. Anyways, got sat down, was greeted very nicely by our server Alex (who I think my dad stressed out a little, sorry!!) and he got our drinks very quickly, and refilled them really quickly when we had finished them. Alex, thank you so much for your kind service and making my dads dinner special. I would also like to reach out to you and say thank you so much for being so kind to my little sister and giving her a refill; she is a very picky eater and will only drink that one thing. Excellent service like always. I hope my dad gave you a nice tip, you really deserve it.

Dani J.,"Vista, CA",301,232,284,1.0,12/5/2012,"This one time, a few years ago, I went to Applebee's for steak (why...whyy???), and got so grossed out by the bloody, purple artery-type thing jiggling its way out of the meat that I swore I'd never eat at another Applebee's again.  One night a few weeks ago, our friends suggested we all meet for dinner. One of them was craving the queso at Applebee's, so against my better judgement, I obliged rather than pleading nooo. What a mistake that was! We got the aforementioned queso, and much to her disappointment, it was smaller and colder than she remembered it being.  Entrees arrived, and I seriously couldn't believe what I saw. I ordered a burger, thinking hey, can't go wrong with that. It was a small greaseball, and looked like it was thrown on the plate with a small handful of fries. I could have had a SUBSTANTIALLY better burger and fries (and soda!) for half the prize at Carls Jr.  My boyfriend got chicken fingers thinking the same thing, can't screw up chicken fingers. Wrong again! They were tiny (notice a trend here?), so overcooked they were hard and chewy, and once again, a small handful of fries thrown on the plate. They should start using smaller plates, at least it wouldn't look so barren and sh*tty. He was starving, and he didn't even eat half. Which in Applebee's portions is like a tablespoon of chicken fingers. Also, their honey mustard is gross. I don't get how people eat here. With choices like Chilis, BJs, etc. where the food actually tastes good, it is just a mystery to me.  You know what the worst part about all of it was? Paying $40+ for 2 small crappy meals, a soda, a beer, splitting an app that is just chips and dip, and leaving hungry. If you are questioning whether you want to give Applebee's another shot, maybe it's changed, maybe it's better...don't do it!!!!

Coworkers and I sat down for some drinks and food after work. We sat at the bar, since we were only doing appetizers and really just wanted to have a couple drinks. (Trust me, you'd want a drink after our work days too) We were fair warned by another patron at the restaurant about how bad the service was. We left it go, ""maybe it will be different with us."" 15 minutes after sitting down, still no one. (Not even for water) We set our menus to the side and continued our conversation. 20 minutes later, FINALLY, someone came. We made our drink order, server was nice, no complaints. Except our drinks took a little too long. I'm unsure if they had to go to another country for the tequila, or if they were just........ slow. Margarita's WEAK btw. I know this, so I ordered a beer.  Order food. Came out normally. I had to ASK FOR NAPKINS AND FORKS. Didn't ask how we were doing. If we needed anything else. Just drop food and turn around and go. That's what robots do. They also don't get tips. Choose wisely servers/runners. (I used to work in a restaurant over 10 years ago, so I know how YOU are suppose to be) Drinks came out slowly but it was probably a good idea, since I down beer like water.  Long story short, we talked to the manager and he was kind enough to give us a discount and apologized (this was excellent since a lot of places don't; please see other reviews). Will I go back? Let's just say the time I went to this place before this time was over a year ago. So it may be about a year or so before I go back. There is better restaurants with better service.

The biggest reason we go here, is because Chili's is also right there, actually equidistant from our house.  And whenever we're up in the air, as happened earlier this week, we decided to go to Chili's because we had not been there in a long time, we've frequented Applebee's on those work nights when we are too tired to make dinner....and now we remember why we always end up at Applebee's.  We walked into Chili's and sat for 5 minutes with no greeting at a bar table.  Moved to the bar top and the bartender also ignored us for a full 5 minutes.  So we left and went to Applebee's.  Sat at the bar and were helped immediately.  It's a similar restaurant model and the service is WAY better at Applebee's.  We consistently get bad service at the Oceanside Chili's.

K S.,"San Diego, CA",0,15,,1.0,9/11/2016,"Clean, we'll managed Applebees. I had two problems though. One was with the smoothie...the bartender poured syrup around the glass then put the smoothie in switch made the smoothie overly sweet to say the least. (I saw him do that to a few other drinks too). Second was I ordered my burger pink and it came well done, the American cheese reminded me of a cheap fast food burger and my egg was far from runny. The manager seemed very irritated with me trying to prove me wrong. Funny enough, she was the first person I noticed when I sat down and she seemed very unhappy. I can't see myself coming back here for food again. 3 stars for appeal and cleanliness. I'm adding to this since this afternoon to report that I have food poisoning from Applebee's. I am 90 percent sure that it was the burger when I asked for medium they gave me mooing cow that I ate 2 bites of it before I realized it was very rare.

The manager came over and tried making excuses for why it was there. In the end, they still had to pay for their food, which I thought was bull. Now for our table, my husband ordered a steak stir fry, or whatever it's called. When it came out, it was literally just rice, broccoli and steak. No sauce, super super dry. It's supposed to be a stir fry?? We told our waitress and the manager came over and asked what was wrong. After we explained it to her, she sarcastically asked if our water tasted okay. Super rude, not professional, I would give this place no stars if possible.

So when we pulled up into the Curbside designated parking spots, we were not hopeful that things would be going our way. However, we were pleasantly surprised that upon parking someone was immediately out to the car (I accidently the out the receipt, but I believe the girl's name was Falascity - forgive the spelling of its wrong!).

We immediately called and asked to speak to a manager, we were  transfered to someone who asked us what was going on, then said it was impossible to have a spider in their bag as their bags are laid flat in a box. They said we could drive back and they would look at it then maybe make our food again.

She proceeded to take the orders of our preteens without checking if they were on the same tickets so there was confusion when my son and my best friend's kid had the 2 for $25. Then it took an additional 15 minutes for her to bring my 1 year old a juice box and everyone had gotten their drinks and getting seconds. She brought my friend a watered down long island and when he ordered top shelf it was even worse. So she called her self talking to the bartender who proceeded to literally put 2 drops in it as they both laughed, not knowing we could see them. When questioned she became speechess. We then requested to speak to the manager as she tried to lie and say that's not what happened. Our food was cold, and the manager Zac tried to make it right. The only problem is the night was ruined and appetites were lost. They tried to offer free deserts but not even the kids wanted to be there any longer.

My son was poking around on it, I wasn't watching, because how could he spend money if I didn't swipe my card? Oh, because they add it on to your bill. He tapped a couple of games, didn't play, and we still got charged. I dont think games or screens need to be on each table, that's not why families dine, and that's why I didn't pay for one.

This Applebee's always seems dirty to me, and it was even more so since the evening was young, and while I wasn't, at least I was relatively alert.  Of course the menus were correspondingly grubby, but I pushed away mental images of the kitchen's state to concentrate on the latest special.  They always have a gimmick - this time it was two entrees and an appetizer for $20 - if they'd thrown in a dessert I'd have been hooked.  They still offered the assemble-your-own Ultimate Trio which HG selected, and I broke my rule of not ordering chicken in a restaurant because it's not special enough, and got the dijon chicken and portabellos.  I shouldn't have strayed - the steamed vegetables and little red potatoes were great, but the chicken, while moist and flavorful, just wasn't that exciting, and the pieces of mushroom were very small.  The $2.99 add-on salad was surprisingly good (excellent fresh croutons) and large - much more attractive than its Denny's counterpart.  HG chose too many fried things, but felt fine due to the mango peach sangria which refreshed us though the more traditional one may have stood up to the ice better. A couple of managers stopped by to see how we fared, and it didn't occur to me to say, ""Your place is dirty"".  That would have been just rude - I already knew going in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-oceanside-3?start=120

Watered down and no flavor (or liquor for that matter). I can see why it was on the 2 for 20 deal. I will say that on a previous visit I had a cheeseburger that was excellent. One star. I ordered the fish and chips which was disgusting. The fish was so greasy! It makes my heart hurt just thinking about it. The saving grace of the meal was the dessert. I had the Chimicheesecake. It was absolutely delicious. One star.  The server started off pretty good but he gradually lost interest in us. He actually brought the check out before the dessert! AND the dessert wasn't even included in the bill. So when we tried to get his attention to alert him to this error he came over and said ""Wuz up?""
