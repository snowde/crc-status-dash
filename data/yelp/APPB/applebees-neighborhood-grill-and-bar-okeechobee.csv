Dennis G.,"Coral Gables, FL",0,27,4,3.0,11/1/2014,"Two hours to dine in a casual restaurant. Granted it was Halloween, but still. Waiters were very good in offering apologies for the kitchen backup food was slow to come out and there really not that busy when we got there. The rush came much later. You have to blame this one on the manager as he did not staff his kitchen with the number of cooks needed for a Friday night. Food was fine so I have nothing to complain about.  Staff were good in keeping our drinks filled up and the offering of apologies throughout the night. Doubt I will ever go back on a busy Friday night again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-okeechobee
Angie G.,"Inman, SC",3,65,18,1.0,12/29/2015,"You better skip this place!!!' Horrible service, manager acts like he doesn't even have a clue, & service was awful! On top of awful service, our waitress looked so unprofessional. She was covered in tattoos & boons hanging out of her top! I am sorry but tattoos, No matter how popular, are unprofessional! And all she did was complain about wanting to go home! Really? Just so your job, buy a shortcrust fits & cover up your trashy tattoos!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-okeechobee
Sandra J.,"Queenstown, MD",55,4,,1.0,2/28/2016,"Out of town  --let me just say it was crowded with kids that should not have been at the bar We asked to sit in the bar an were passed up by  a so called waitress without a personality . Passed the table by three times when we asked her for Menus she blew us off on the door staff saying if she didn't give you a menu we don't know your here-unless passing our Table three times doesn't count as being able to see. Then the front staff door greeters she told we needed menus just blew us off . 5 dirty tables in the sitting area  ,poor service , Lack of customer service an inward atmosphere. Eat here if you don't care about service. Won't recommend or return  Called an manager even blew off the call How sad",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-okeechobee
Caleb S.,"Lehigh Acres, FL",0,7,,2.0,6/26/2016,"A disinterested server and uninspired food. I had the ""wood fired"" grilled chicken breast  tough and unflavored. I've had better than that at McDonald's. In all fairness the baked potato was good. Took an act of God to get my drink refilled. I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-okeechobee
Eric V.,"Okeechobee, FL",8,3,23,1.0,11/19/2015,"Seriously? Waited 10 minutes before we got our drinks and only got our drinks because I went to the bar to order them (and carried them to the table myself). Now we've been here 20 minutes and no waitress has approached our table at all. Every waitress working and the manager has walked by, and nobody has said one word to us! There are three occupied tables on the side that we are sitting. How do you run a restaurant like this?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-okeechobee
Deb W.,"Jupiter, FL",0,6,5,1.0,5/28/2016,"I'm not found of any restaurant that rounds your check!  Won't be back,  food not that impressive. We were even charged extra for sending something back due to the way it was cooked. The item was removed when we brought it to the waitress attention.  If you go look over your check!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-okeechobee
Kenneth P.,"Okeechobee, FL",0,14,,1.0,6/6/2015,"Worse restaurant in town, the only reason it makes money is because its right next to a popular hotel",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-okeechobee
Annon A.,"Weed, CA",0,14,,5.0,1/11/2016,"I think this is the best applebees I've been to. The bourbon steak I had was amazing,  and the drink was on point,  even my daughter's fries were awesome.  The bathroom was clean even and our server, Aj was very polite and courteous, quick and kept my daughter in mind the whole time we waited for food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-okeechobee
T K.,"Okeechobee, FL",0,10,2,5.0,7/2/2015,Good food and service. We come here at least 2x a week for lunch and they haven't disappointed us. Happy hour is all day everyday no other restaurants in town offer this.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-okeechobee
Erin W.,"Okeechobee, FL",0,1,,5.0,5/9/2015,"My daughter took me there for a Mother's day lunch. Hostess was extremely pleasant. Our server Brittany was super friendly, very informative & unbelievably attentive. We ordered several entrees,  all delicious & good size portions, not one complaint. Brittany made our lunch extra nice by being such a pro. Definitely plan to go back & for sure will ask for Brittany. Thank you V for taking me to such a lovely pace!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-okeechobee
Joe N.,"St. Cloud, FL",0,10,,4.0,11/12/2014,"Food was great. We got two appetizers the spinach artichoke dip and some hot wings. The wings were not quite hot enough for my liking but the spinach artichoke dip was incredibly rich and the chips were so light and flaky that I could've eaten them all as a meal. The quesadilla burger- there's an Applebee's exclusive and it is awesome. All the flavor without the carbs of the bun. Our waiter, Justin was the bomb.  Cool, laid-back, intelligent and attentive. He is too good to be working in this restaurant in my opinion. If you're staying at the Hampton Inn in Okeechobee and can walk across the parking lot, you'd be nuts not to eat here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-okeechobee
