Noneya B.,"Lacey, WA",1,29,10,5.0,12/8/2017,"We had a lovely dinner tonight with our kiddos. Our server, Chris, was super nice--attentive without being pesky, and friendly without being manic.  It was pretty busy, but we didn't have to wait long, and the service was very fast. The restaurant was also very clean. I can't really comment on the food...standard American restaurant fare, I didn't have to cook, and I don't have food poisoning, so: win!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-olympia-2
Matt L.,"Olympia, WA",14,1,,1.0,8/21/2017,"This is one of the worst places I've eaten at in the last year.  I used to be a loyal customer,  but the food was never great. However,  over the last year it's gotten pretty bad.   The service in Olympia isn't so bad.  The food is, other than the grilled asparagus.  Steaks are over cooked; a medium well came out past well done, and a medium came out well done on the verge of being well done. The mashed potatoes are are rubbery.  The appetizers are much smaller than they used to be,  and rubbery.  The only thing good about applebees is the perfect margarita.  I will not be visiting here again to choke down less than McDonalds quality food. If it's not obvious,  that was an insult.  Good luck staying in business in towns with more than 5 restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-olympia-2

Life As P.,"West Covina, CA",1,47,17,5.0,12/9/2017,"Last night my fiancé and I went in for dinner a few minutes before happy hour. We were bummed we couldn't do the half off appetizers but we did find another deal which was 2 entree plus an appetizer for $22 and immediately ordered that. The server was alright but the manager was excellent on handling our order since I had some minor issues with my pasta being barely any coating of sauce... it tasted like boiled pasta out of the microwave with shaved cheese on top. The manager's name is Victor and he exceeded out of his way to make us satisfied, the server, ehhhh, not so really... I would have this review a two stars but Victor deserves five stars for his awesome service and providing us positive attitude! I probably won't be returning due to the lack of customer service from some of those servers but I would be returning to a different Applebee's around town, maybe in Lacey!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-olympia-2

Alexandra C.,"Palm Desert, CA",4,78,48,5.0,5/14/2017,"This place rocks!!!! Every time! Their selection is incredible, and the food is consistently great! My boyfriend and I have tried many different entrees and apps. One of our favorite appetizers is the Siracha Shrimp! The burgers are a little messy, but packed with flavor. Last visit I had the pulled pork tacos, which were amazing! There is so much to choose from! However, What really makes the experience is the service. We have visited this location 8 or so times, and have never received poor service. That alone says something for a restaurant. Genesis, or waitress the other evening, is truly phenomenal. She is so genuine and knowledgeable. She represents the establishment enthusiastically, and really makes us feel welcomed and comfortable every time .

I ended up throwing my food away. I ordered a steak as well and requested it well done. I received it BARELY medium well. There was still a lot of pink in it. I basically couldn't eat any of it.

Jisool M.,"Olympia, WA",0,2,,3.0,1/28/2017,"Service - was a little slow on a Friday night. One thing I was surprised to see was that the waitress (who brought the ice drinks) just sprayed the ice cubes across the floor from her tray after delivering our drinks. They must have been ice cubes that were left on her tray but I was really surprised at her manner to have left ice cubes everywhere where customers could have stepped and slipped on them..  Food - I had the ribs and it was well cooked, but the sauce was a little salty. The Caesar salad was decently fresh vegetables but the dressing made the lettuce a little matted. The cheese potatoes and broccoli sides were yummy and went well with the ribs. Ingredients could be fresher, but overall was decent quality food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-olympia-2
Jason L.,"Lacey, WA",0,26,7,2.0,11/25/2016,"I have come to the conclusion that Applebee's has fallen on hard times. Service is really not up to par, and the quality of their appetizers leave a fair bit to be desired.  Couple all of this with a happy hour that isn't worth coming in for, in terms of value.  The bartender, N. W. seems more preoccupied with inviting patrons who are regulars to a party at her house than with paying attention to the rest of the bar. She could also learn to practice some discretion by controlling the volume of her voice.  And, make sure you ask for the check very clearly, because even with the bar emptying out, it is a hell of an ordeal getting a check.  Then again, I think our bartender needs to take up a career in party planning, rather than bartending.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-olympia-2?start=20

Asked if it was plain, the waitress explained that it had butter and garlic on it... but that she could get 'Childs broccoli ', which would be plain.    When my dish came, broccoli was dripping with butter,  I asked to make sure--- they came and took it away!   As we were settling our checks, the waitress informed us that our meager steaks were indeed 8 oz not 6 oz and we would be charged accordingly!   Humph!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-olympia-2?start=20

I was pescatarian for awhile so I was really into eating seafood when I ate out. They don't have a great seafood selection. I think most of their food is pretty good, but honestly I would rather go next door to the Olive Garden where I can pick from unlimited salad or soup, and those mouth watering breadsticks... yumm.

I assumed he was putting together some silverware. But then he walked to the back room out of sight. I waited a while longer then walked to the bar to ask for silverware from the bartender rather than stare at our food any longer.  She apologized.

Estella N.,"Seattle, WA",6,75,27,4.0,6/9/2013,"First time visit at this location for brunch with family and friends.  We arrived soon after they opened and seated immediately.  Our server was new to Applebees and let us know, but did very well and was very attentive and personable.   I ordered hot tea and noticed that the metal tea pot thing was a little crusty on the buttom.  I took the spoon and scraped the bottom and some residue dislodged and floated in the water. I didn't drink it. Thankfully I was given a mug of hot water in addition to the tea pot so all was well in the tea enjoyment experience aside from the crusty pot.  I was also given a wedge of lemon, packet of honey, and spoon with my tea which was nice.   I ordered the biscuits and gravy meal. It didn't take long for our orders to be ready and the eggs were nicely cooked to order.  Yum! The meal was altogether savory and filling. The biscuits were a bit hard on the outside but the insides were soft.  The ample gravy helped soften the outer part of the biscuits. Yum nonetheless. The sausage was chewy, maybe a little overcooked, but I prefer that vs undercooked.  I'll definitely come back again for breakfast and brunch. Service and food was pretty darn good. I also liked arriving soon after they open, it's quiet and calm and quick service.

Bree H.,"Shelton, WA",24,108,20,3.0,7/1/2014,"Lots of menu options (even some lo-cal that are really tasty!), good consistency and actually really great service, in my experience. I like to sit in the bar for a bit better atmosphere. The Green Bean Crispers appetizer is DELICIOUS, if you're into that sort of thing (I am, and how). Ditto the won-ton taco appetizer, and pub pretzel sticks.  The fries are usually over-salted. I put copious amounts of salt on most things, and I don't need to salt the fries here. That's pretty unheard of for me, so I am just going to assume that some people would be a bit displeased with them. They changed the French Onion Soup recipe about a year or so ago, and it's definitely not as good as it once was.  I also mysteriously never seem tempted by any of their desserts...everything seems to be some combination of ice cream and/or chocolate - 2 things this Martian isn't that excited by.

Came here on a Friday night, they very busy but we were able to get a seat in the bar right away. Decided on the 2 for $20 deal, and both ended up ordering the same thing: sirloin steak with mashed potatoes and vegetables. Shared the buffalo chicken ""wings"", which were the only ""eh"" part of the meal. Weren't terrible, but wouldn't order again. The steaks were PERFECT, tender and juicy. Vegetables were cooked well but bland and could have been fresher. Not bad though. All the wait staff were very friendly and attentive, really awesome service.  Only complaints: Upon being served, waitress asked us to slice into our steaks to check if done to our liking. Although it was nice of her to make sure, this resulted in a lot of juices running from the steaks. :( Would have preferred to let it rest a minute first, but didn't want to refuse the request. Seems like this  practice is Applebee's policy, should be reconsidered in my opinion. Girlfriend wanted a beer, but selection was limited. Do people actually drink Coors? 0_o Anyways, she went with a Pyramid Haywire which ended up costing $5.50!?

Jon Y.,"Olympia, WA",0,4,,1.0,2/6/2016,"I have been going to this Applebee's for well over 2 years now.  It used to be great you walk in get a seat relatively quick and service with a smile and they were always willing to wrk with you.  What true service should be.  I don't know if this place is under new management or they just don't care anymore, but I had my worst experience in a restaurant that I have ever had yesterday.   First they could find a place for us to get service.  Mind you that it was just me and my wife.  Then the beat they could come up with was for us to sit in the bar area.  So we take a seat get comfortable and her come the bar tender to take our order.  She ask for our ID.  My wire is in her mid thirties and I am in my mid forties.  My wife did not have her ID and they said they had to move us because it was policy to ask for an ID.  Oh we were not ordering drinks either just food.  Then we moved and sat there for around 5 to 10 minutes in a restaurant that was dang near empty and not one server came to the table.  The bar tender could have work with us a talked to a manager to make an exception but instead they wanted to inconvenience the customer.  So we left went next door to the Olive Garden and receive the service that everyone should get when going to a restaurant.  I will not go to this Applebee's again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-olympia-2?start=40
Monty H.,"West Seattle, Seattle, WA",40,45,56,4.0,12/28/2013,Stopped in for dinner. The place was packed and we got in really quickly even with a party of 6. The food came out piping hot and was very tasty. There are several restaurants in the area but we choose this place because of the short wait.  Next time I'm in this area I will stop here again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-olympia-2?start=40
Tess S.,"Detroit, MI",146,302,523,3.0,6/1/2012,"Just your average Applebee's, not as busy as the one in Lacey. Prices are decent enough, alcohol prices only worth it during happy hour. Happy hour also brings selected half price appetizers! And the 2 for 20 deal isn't too bad either. Long story short...  it's way more fun if you sit at the bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-olympia-2?start=40
Matt R.,"Olympia, WA",1,11,12,5.0,6/5/2015,Genesis is fantastic! So fun and great to interact with. She treated us (a table of cackling 20 y/o's) with respect and humor!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-olympia-2?start=40
Kayla W.,"Olympia, WA",8,16,6,5.0,2/23/2013,"The best Applebee's I've been to! The food was so good and so was the service! Everyone was wry friendly and I liked how the manager actually took time to stop by every table and make sure things were good. Since the remodel, the place looks fresher and nicer!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-olympia-2?start=40
Sarah E.,"Olympia, WA",67,599,71,2.0,10/24/2012,"I used to love Applebee's....when I was a kid. I came here for a kid's b-day party and even though we had a large group, they seated us and waited on us very quickly. The reason why my review is so low is the food. It seems like everything served here comes out of a bag or can and NOTHING is fresh. I seriously can't imagine how much preservatives and high fructose corn syrup is in their food.  They do have a great dinner deal for two people where you share an appetizer and each get an entree for $20. We tried their buffalo wings, which were 99% breading and 1% chicken so it tasted like a bread ball drenched in buffalo sauce. Eh gross. The entree selections were dominated by shrimp, which I am allergic to so that eliminated 5 of the 8 possibilities for me. We ended up trying the riblet basket and the oriental chicken salad. The salad hardly had any lettuce, and was mostly dried noodles and almonds. Weird, and gross. The riblets were good. The BBQ sauce was alright, and overall it was OK. They were having happy hour, which is a pretty good deal. I had a hurricane and it was very strong and delish for only $5. I needed all of that booze to get me through the crap food. Overall the service is great, but the food is gross. I ended up paying for it later that day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-olympia-2?start=40
N A.,"Washougal, WA",5,20,,2.0,10/24/2011,"Waiter was great and attentive, but the food was just off -- fajitas overseasoned; jalapeños on burger were sweet (never had that before); a special order of fajitas (without meat) came half-size (you'd think they'd give extra veggies); and it took way too long to arrive.  Just stick to simple food and read the menu carefully and maybe you'll be alright.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-olympia-2?start=40
Jonathan F.,"Olympia, WA",4,6,1,3.0,2/29/2012,"I imbibed the mack m jacks which came in a particularly frosty glass, it also had a excellent head. As far as food goes I ordered the bourbon street chicken n shrimp the flavors where pleasing to my palate though the chicken was a bit dry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-olympia-2?start=40
Linda C.,"Raymond, WA",0,27,,1.0,2/7/2014,My husband and I went there yesterday afternoon for lunch. We were startled by the hostess who opened the door for us. I would rather do that myself. She asked if we wanted to be seated at the bar. We chose our own table. The service was less than I expected. The food was also less than I expected. my husband 's club sandwich was sloppy and did not look like a club sandwich. No choices for vegetarians and the food all looked like it came out of a package. The coffee was terrible. Overpriced and under served and we will not be back. We had to wait too long for our check as it was not very busy.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-olympia-2?start=40
