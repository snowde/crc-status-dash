Royal B.,"Omaha, NE",424,256,17,4.0,11/7/2015,"Cleanliness 4 Service 5 Food 3 Likelihood 4 1-5 (5 Best!) 4.0 Hey everyone!  It was dinner for 4 last night.  I must say ""M"" was our server, she was awesome.  I rarely give out 5's for anything, much less service.  She rocked.  We wanted for nothing.  Refills, NEVER had to ask.  Checking in, never wanted for anything that she was not there to provide.  Clearing dirty dishes, never missed a beat!  We brought the manager to the table to share that with him.   We experienced WOW service tonight.  Something I don't have the pleasure of receiving at most any restaurant (chain, local, or regional.) Food was good, you can tell it had set in the window a bit before being brought out.  It was our understanding they were short on expo runners and in the kitchen.  That explains a lot. Restrooms were VERY clean.  We chose this location because the two closer locations (Dodge Street, and Sorenson Parkway) had failed at food and service our last several times eating there.   We WILL go back to this location and ask for ""M""...  Good job!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-omaha-14
Kaite S.,"Omaha, NE",344,146,144,2.0,10/23/2017,"A group of us came here for a lunch meeting on a Monday and the place was dead. It took the server an obscene amount of time to greet us and even longer to bring the drinks. Of the five drinks, three were wrong and we had to ask for the fifth several times. Over the course of the meal, the server kept disappearing. Unfortunately, no one else stepped in to check on the table. It's not that they were understaffed, mind you. There were two elderly greeters, a couple bartenders and a handful of servers to cover the four occupied tables. For only having three other tables (most already had their meals), the food took an unacceptable amount of time to come out. None of the meals were anywhere near hot. My caprese burger had grotesquely large slabs of watery tomatoes and no basil or flavor.  I might come back for drinks at the bar before going out for the evening, but probably won't attempt the food again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-omaha-14
Karina C.,"Omaha, NE",92,172,54,2.0,1/17/2017,"We went on a Sunday night and thought we might have to wait to be seated. Turns out there were maybe 5 other people in the restaurant.  Menus were dirty, had hair and food stains on them, food came out quick. We did the 2 for 20 deal and got the wings to start which were the best out of all the meal. I had the Butchers Meat and Potato that was nothing special and John had the Sirloin stir fry that was ok. We both had a beer. Service was ok, but the place looks run down and food was barely ok.  They also have those game screens on the table that ask trivia style questions. I'd much rather not have that at my table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-omaha-14
Bill E.,"Omaha, NE",56,129,60,2.0,12/3/2017,"I don't even know how much detail to go into on the lack of service I had when I was here. It started when I walked in an no one seated me and there was no signage saying wait or seat yourself, so when I wasn't acknowledged, I went ahead and seated myself only to be reprimanded by the young host who said I could sit in any section but the one I was in. Things went downhill from there as I had no service after I received a cup of water that the host brought me 5 minutes after seating me. I believe I was there for at least 10 minutes before I started watching the clock to see how long I waited for service. After waiting 20 (since starting the clock watching) I called and asked to speak to a manager. He came over and I explained that I wasn't staying but that I wanted him to know why I was leaving. The waitress who had been ignoring me walked by 2 times while he was talking with me and never acknowledged me then either. The only reason they are getting a second star is due to how apologetic the manager was and for the gift card he gave me for the inconvenience of the evening.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-omaha-14
Shengqun L.,"Landrum, SC",2,36,242,2.0,2/16/2017,The wings were too salty and the celery were very old which are not fresh at all.  I do like the potato.  It was very busy. But I don't think I will go back to this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-omaha-14
Claire H.,"Omaha, NE",3,48,32,4.0,3/12/2017,"Pretty good restaurant. There's nothing that makes it stand out, but there's nothing wrong with it. The food is good. They have a healthier portion of the menu if you're looking to cut down on the calories. I ordered the cedar grilled lemon chicken. The chicken was the best part: seasoned perfectly and topped with lemon olive oil vinaigrette. Great place to take your family!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-omaha-14
Makenna H.,"Cumming, IA",3,22,3,1.0,1/20/2017,"Came in for half priced apps. The place was a joke. Karaoke was going on and it was clear, everyone thought it was a joke. Food took 40+ minutes for only appetizers, and we were the only people who ordered food. 30 minutes into the order, we asked for it to go. Bartender was frustrated with us, but we couldn't hear anything due to the volume.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-omaha-14
Kathleen P.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,11,,1.0,2/5/2017,Usually Applebys is a great quick tasty and inexpensive restaurant. Yesterday was the last time I will ever go to this establishment. The service was non existent. The Thai shrimp salad was bland.  The server was not attentive. When she came to check after our lunch was served she just asked and kept going. No opportunity to respond. I couldn't eat the salad. No manager circulated in the restaurant.  A terrible experience,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-omaha-14
Bill W.,"Omaha, NE",0,11,,3.0,9/3/2016,Definitely not a steak house. The new woodfired grill leaves a lot to be desired. The steak was really tough. I get a better steak from the grocery store.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-omaha-14
Alex N.,"Omaha, NE",1,6,,1.0,5/23/2015,"We were seated in the large booth, instantly when we sat down we noticed an odor similar to that of rotting food.  After receiving what can only be described as sub par food I went to speak with the manager about the odor that has by now made me loose my appetite and give me a lovely headache along with others in the group.  She informed me that they were resolving the problem.  That's great but thanks for seating us in the sewer section. Shortly after we arrived a party of roughly 20 was seated in section our server immediately forgot about us and then got an attitude.    I'm disappointed I actually liked that Applebee's and the food and service used to be nice.  Thanks Crapplebee's we won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-omaha-14
Melissa A.,"Omaha, NE",39,139,115,4.0,10/8/2015,"I think they changed the menu, but I'm not sure.  Seems to be pretty much the same as any other Applebees has been for 20 years. Not bad. But nothing special.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-omaha-14
Brooklynn S.,"Omaha, NE",33,1,,5.0,3/9/2016,Awesome service. Greg is a rockstar. The food is great. I'll be back for sure!!! Had the 2 for 25 and strawberry lemonades!  The steak and we both got mac and cheese and mash potatoes. They also gave us to go cups!!! Thank you guys!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-omaha-14
Jade H.,"Omaha, NE",11,52,3,1.0,2/21/2015,"For such a low rated place, it was busy tonight. I have gone to the Applebee's in Lincoln and LOVED it so I thought I would go to another one in Omaha.... never again. I understand it was busy but people who had been seated after us where getting their food! We waited for our appetizer that was good (aside from a still frozen in the middle cheese stick) then came out dinner. We ordered the chicken tenders platter, I would not recommend this as something to share. We though it would be good size chicken strips that we could split but nope!! The chicken tenders where super small and we only got 5 of them for a large platter.  My drink was another issue. I had a Strawberry Drink (alcoholic) but couldn't taste any alcohol in it. So I asked for a little stronger drink. The lady said sure, I'll have another shot put in it, but it then took forever to get my drink back. Not to mention on the bill, one shot ... just ONE cost $5.00!!! If I had known it would cost that much I would have never gotten it.  So all in all, the food was not well proportioned (or good really), the wait time for food and drink was terrible and the ONLY good thing about this experience was the music they played.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-omaha-14
Jessica P.,"Oregon City, OR",0,29,10,2.0,11/9/2014,"This location is lacking a lot. Needs better employees, Applebee's in general needs a revamped menu, this location constantly gets things wrong or completely forget about one of our orders. I don't care for this location nor this restaurant in general every time after I have it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-omaha-14
Hayley J.,"Omaha, NE",0,2,,5.0,8/8/2015,Love this Applebee's! The servers are so fun and the food is great. We ordered the new blazin Texan and it was a great burger. Love the changes to the menu,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-omaha-14
Niccole M.,"Omaha, NE",32,265,2,2.0,3/15/2013,Our server was an idiot. My very pregnant Aunt waited 20 minutes to get the dessert she ordered.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-omaha-14
Michelle F.,"Omaha, NE",5,15,,2.0,3/13/2013,"Bad food, bad service.  We ordered 2 for $24 with Bourbon St steaks.  We ordered medium and got them well done.  They were also supposed to have mushrooms, I got 2 little pieces of mushroom.  The potatoes were overcooked and dry.  The waitress didn't even ask or care.  We took 1 bite and she brought the bill.  I had to ask the hostess for more ice tea and to go boxes (our dogs will enjoy it, at least) because the waitress forgot to come back.  I had bad experience at another Applebee's before.  This experience just clenched it that we will never go back.  They just do not have good cooks.  Usually our steaks are cooked raw on one side and burnt on the other.  At least this one it was the same all the way through...overcooked. We weren't rude and we tipped waitress appropriately.   I can't believe they are still in business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-omaha-14
