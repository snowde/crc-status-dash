Henny L.,"Holland Hill, Singapore, Singapore",1,36,16,5.0,9/3/2016,"Very good service from Big D (Darrin). We loved the food as well. Grilled salmon was perfect. Honey bbq baby back ribs delish!

Louise V.,"Appleton, WI",0,25,,1.0,12/21/2017,"Let me start by saying I generally have low expectations when it comes to chain restaurants like this. I went for lunch with a friend and we were literally the only customers in the place on a Sunday. We had the worlds worst waiter.  It took an hour to get our food-again, we were the only people there. The food was cold and the baked potato was hard and under cooked. The food was barely edible. When the bill came he didn't just put it on the table he handed it to me and said he would wait for it. I gave him cash and he said do you want all singles and did I need change. How awkward and uncomfortable.  Never asked how the food was - just worried about the tip, which he did not deserve. He came back to the table and asked again if we needed change. Hey dumbass - put it on the table and walk away!!! You made a horrible dining experience even worse. I will NEVER go back to any Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-oshkosh-3
Tiffany B.,"Oshkosh, WI",1,55,,2.0,5/22/2017,"We had been to this Applebee's before and it wasn't bad, but this time it was awful. I don't prefer Applebees usually because it's not really great food, but I thought I would give it a try here. The service was great, but our food was terrible. We got spinach artichoke dip and chips. The dip had random pasta in it. Our chips were very stale. I ordered Bourbon St. Chicken and Shrimp. It was overly seasoned and the chicken had almost a plastic taste to it. i ate maybe two bites. My husband got ribs with mashed potatos and green beans and he said his was actually quite bland. When the waitress came over to us, she asked if we wanted boxes and we said no and then she just said thanks and goodbye. I expected her to ask if everything was okay since we left full plates. We aren't really the type to send back our meals unless there is obviously something foreign in our food (bugs, dirt, hair). We don't like to make a scene and sending back at a restaurant can be risky. We will not be coming back to this Applebees and probably not any other Applebees. They all seem to be the same and I've been to many between WI and FL.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-oshkosh-3
Sharon Z.,"Viejo San Juan, San Juan, Puerto Rico",35,1,,1.0,10/14/2017,Three strikes.  We had wax paper in the steak and shrimp. I found aluminum foil in my french onion soup. Tried again today after several months. This time we ordered CarSide pickup at 12:10 as we had to get to an appointment. Email stated it would be ready at 12:25!  Nice guy came to the car after we waited for almost 10 minutes (12:35 now). Stated they were wrapping the food. At 12:50 we had to go in and see where it was and waited again. We got our food at 12:55. Why did I do carside pickup?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-oshkosh-3
Jonathan P.,"Pelzer, SC",0,7,2,1.0,7/26/2017,"I have been to over 50 different Applebee's all across the USA, and by far this is the worst one I have ever been to. We visited this establishment during the EAA event. We arrived at 10:04 and they informed us they didn't have any food left they only had appetizers remaining.  We decided to eat here anyway which was a mistake. They brought out the spinach dip and the chips were soggy, and the ones that weren't soggy were like plastic. The waitress extremely unenthusiastically replaced the chips with some mediocre chips. Discouraged from the result of the first attempt to correct the issue, we simply left. We will never return to this location again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-oshkosh-3

Stacy M.,"Oshkosh, WI",19,1,,1.0,9/15/2017,"Ordered two 8 oz sirloin meals...because we were told the the 6 oz was sold out for the night. Waited 45 minutes for food. When it arrived, the steaks were not as ordered and burnt. We had ordered medium and they arrived overcooked and tasteless. The mashed potatoes were bland and lukewarm at best. Managed to eat 1/2 of a steak between the two of us, and that piece was mostly fat. Told our waiter and he offered to take the meals off our bill and would get us the manager. Waited ten minutes and no manager. Paid the bill and left because we were hungry and wanted edible food. On the way home, called the restaurant and asked to talk to the manager. Was told the manager was ""too busy to deal with customers"" and hung up on. Stopped back at the restaurant and again asked to speak to a manager. Was again told he was too busy. Asked for a refund and was told that they can't refund a credit card and was offered a coupon for free appetizers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-oshkosh-3
Kelvin R.,"Evans, GA",0,10,,1.0,3/29/2017,"Worst service I ever had, waitress and hostess are unprofessional, don't know how to interact with costumers I don't think they know that customers pay their salaries and if a good service is rendered a tip is in order, but if your service is bad forget about the tip and the customers business. It is so hard to find any good place to eat in this area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-oshkosh-3
Annette R.,"Oshkosh, WI",7,4,,2.0,9/20/2015,Waited a half hour for food. There were four of us. Two of our entrees were served and were then told the other two were taken to the wrong table and they would half to make them over. One that was delivered was ordered medium and served rare. They redid it but we were there longer than we should have been.  One of the managers came to ask us what they could do. I suggested free deserts and they did it but we won't be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-oshkosh-3
Shemone P.,"Oshkosh, WI",0,4,,1.0,2/22/2016,Shitty service you wait forever constant fuck ups and they want you to raise their minimum wage for what? Seriously for what? I mean I can't be mad at the cooks they only do what they are told it's really annoying that you constantly fuck up orders having people dying of thirst waiting for a soda and still expect to have a tip  Well here's a tip if you don't like your career choice then quit I didn't force you to take this job nobody put a gun to your head and said Molly you be a damn waitress or I'll fuckin destroy you no one said that.

Ted L.,"Kingsland, TX",17,74,1,2.0,7/25/2016,"Bad experience. From previous visits it has gone way downhill. Because we normally stat at the Fairfield Inn (2 doors away), we go due to accessibility. No more if they continue to serve below Ave food. Caesar salads had NO dressing ,dry lettuce with cheese and CEO. My steak well done ,not medium, and my friend's chicken inedible. Our waitress Haley the only bright spot of evening. Red Robin here we come tonight.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-oshkosh-3
Jennifer T.,"Tacoma, WA",41,63,1,1.0,4/18/2016,"Sticky menus, bar refused to make a mojito despite that kind of being one of Applebee's things, we had a good server, but the place stunk, was sticky and we were seated in the shittiest space despite a completely empty dining room. The people next to us were waiting for their food for over half an hour. We left and told the hostess why. The response was just, ""Oh.""

Curt V.,"Oshkosh, WI",25,2,1,1.0,7/8/2016,"I have to say it was the slowest service, most incorrect, awkwardly served, tasty meal I have ever had. The best part of the meal was I got to see 3 full innings of the Brewers beating the Cardinals. The bathrooms were unclean, paper all over, and toilets that needed attention. I ordered my 1 appetizer as soon as we were seated that took 25 minutes to get. The meal was ordered 20 mins after sitting down waiter was absent for the first 10 mins. Meal was served nearly an hour from the time we sat down, after asking what was taking so long. Waiter brought one meal to the table at a time. Meal one too much sauce on the chicken wonton. 2 mins later meal two was severed when ordered asked for lettuce and tomato on the burger,not on! Waiter brought out a plate with lots of lettuce ,one pickle size tomato, pickles, and onions. 5 to 7 mins later meal 3 is finally served when ordered asked for a side of French fries and a cup of honey mustard. Back to the kitchen he goes! 10 mins later he comes back with piping hot fries ,NO HONEY MUSTARD! By this time frustration set in and didn't ask for anything more. This is the first time in a very long time I have had to flag (press call server button) waiter down to get more napkins, and to go boxes ,paid for meal at the table and left the minimum 15 percent! Will not be returning to waste another hour plus of my life.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-oshkosh-3

Tim D.,"Johnston, IA",25,195,14,1.0,5/1/2012,"Didn't know the area and usually when in a new place we stick with the staple favorites like Applebee's. This time we should not have. The service was slow, with half hearted wait staff more interested in talking to each other than the paying customers. A couple near us upped and left due to the lack of service. Our meals were served after a LONG wait, quality was just OK, not what we are used to at Applebee's. Then their portion size was very small, no, we did not order a petite size or the lunch menu, this was off the dinner menu. Overall very disappointing for this food chain. Next time in the area we will just bypass this place and go elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-oshkosh-3
Bridget M.,"Chicago, IL",0,16,,2.0,12/18/2016,"while the server and manager were super friendly, everything else about the place was pretty bad.  the booth was grimy and the table was sticky.  the drinks tasted like kool-aid with alcohol.  the food was bland and completely joyless (how do you screw up a club sandwich?  more importantly, how do you screw up french fries?). i usually don't go to applebee's and this experience did not convince me to change my habits.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-oshkosh-3
Jeff E.,"Oshkosh, WI",4,82,32,4.0,1/30/2015,"Applebee's has always been a mixed bag for me depending on which one you go to with service and food.  The Oshkosh Applebee's in this experience was great!  The first thing noticed when we arrived at Applebee's is that they have a reserved parking spot for US Military veterans which is absolutely awesome & a great small way to thank our veterans every single day at Applebee's...a great thing to see.  Upon entering the restaurant we were seated immediately.  We were offered the drink of the day which was a new take on Mountain Dew with a tropical taste....pretty good tasting overall.  The only real issue with the experience occurred between the ordering of our food and it coming out.  Not a real excessive wait, but just a bit longer than expected since they were not super busy.  When the food came out though it was good and hot so it's possible that something in our order had to be remade or something like that.  I had a Mac & Cheese pasta with grilled chicken, fish & chips, Bourbon steak, and chicken strips.  The Mac & Cheese with grilled chicken was very good, the fish & chips was good as well, and the chicken strips followed suit.  The Bourbon steak was also prepared perfectly which rounded out the experience nicely.  The only star removed was for the wait which I will update should my next experience prove to not have the wait.  Overall highly recommended if you want some good food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-oshkosh-3
Jacob J.,"Oshkosh, WI",0,3,,2.0,3/3/2015,"Poor customer service. It took nearly an hour for us to get our food. Not reccommended if you plan on bringing more than one person.

Nolan R.,"Tampa, FL",110,295,94,4.0,2/18/2013,"I arrived late in Oshkosh and was afraid I'd be eating from a vending machine at the local Hampton Inn. Lucky for me there was an Applebee's within walking distance. I was starving and in need of a drink after driving from Duluth after a full day of work - yikes!  I sat at the bar with the other businessmen in town for the night. They were from D.C. and I was from Tampa. The service I got here was 2nd to none and I was at the bar. Usually when you sit at the bar, you give up on some food service - not here. The bartender was all over it. I had some blackened tilapia and it was great. Would I come back here if I was in Oshkosh? Heck yes! Also, they've got free wifi so you can ignore the people you came with or the chatty people at the bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-oshkosh-3?start=20

Nicole T.,"Cedarburg, WI",1,2,,2.0,11/19/2014,"Went here for half price apps at 10 pm with a few friends, and it was a terrible experience. We we seated quickly and ordered food without a problem. It then took a full hour for our food to come. When it did it looked and tasted like it had been sitting under the heat lamps for at least a half hour. One of my friends overheard a server saying how food was done but couldn't be brought out to certain tables until tables that had been waiting longer received their food so that was why our took so long. I ordered a nacho plate and had to send it back because it was inedible. The lettuce on top was burnt, actually burnt, from sitting under the heat lamp for so long and the sour cream was HOT. The manager did not apologize but offered to replace my nachos. I heard her complaining about me to an employee later in the night about me. The entire night took 2 hours after all the waiting, and the food quality was poor. No one in my group did more than pick at their plated.
