Billy H.,"Nashville, TN",168,644,2992,3.0,5/24/2015,"I've always been a sucker for AppleBee's appetizer sampler. Tonight I was in town & some friends decided on going to AppleBees. We arrive around 9pm on a Friday & sat at the bar. Our bartender was very friendly & only check my ID. I'm 30 but she said I looked 17 so that made me feel good. I ordered a bourbon and diet & she asked if Kentucky Tavern was okay and I said it was. I don't mind KT at all.  The others in my group ordered some appetizers, 4 to be exact. Some quesadillas, onion rigs, pretzels and something else I cannot remember. I tried the onion rings and they were pretty good. They come with a VERY sweet BBQ sauce of sorts.  AppleBees is an okay place to have a few drinks & some good food. They've got a random clientele, from country bumpkins to teenage kids. My KT & diet was $4.79 a glass, which isn't bad. I've had cheaper at other bars before, but I cannot complain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-owensboro-3
B B.,"Owensboro, KY",5,65,43,1.0,6/13/2015,"Poor service, and it's not due to being busy. The music was very over the top loud.  When our Green Goddess salad was brought to us it had old lettuce.   We won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-owensboro-3
Rho L.,"Cook, IL",33,40,49,1.0,7/23/2016,"What's the point of having curb side service IF YOU NEVER BRING THE FOOD OUT! I sat in the curb side parking space for 30 minutes after the time they told me to pick up my food and it never came out. I finally went inside to get my food and saw at least 10 servers sitting around doing nothing, oh wait they were doing something: they were standing around talking to each other. I was asked if the pickup for my now Luke warm food was for me and I just said yes and left. Then to top it all off, the order was wrong! Seriously!?!? I will never ever visit this place again and I will warn all of my friends to stay away!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-owensboro-3
K L.,"Mount Juliet, TN",0,3,,1.0,8/3/2016,"Not a good experience.  In town on business- tired and didn't want to search for food options so I looked this location up on Yelp, without looking at other reviews, placed a curbside order. After I sat for 15 minutes at curbside- I began to read other reviews for this location. Could have saved time if I had. What bothered me the most was 2 times an employee walked by, looked at me and ...nothing.  At 30 minutes, I left. This location was NOT busy and I just ordered a chicken roll-up.  I drove across the street and O' Charley's could not have been more friendly and helpful. It was unbelievable how quick they had my order completed and I was out the door.  Morale of story- read reviews first if your are from out of town!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-owensboro-3
Roger M.,"Owensboro, KY",18,28,24,2.0,1/2/2015,"Stopped in for lunch and ordered the Crispy Fried shrimp. It came with fries and cole slaw. I thought the shrimp was okay, however the cocktail sauce was a little different from what I am used to. There wasn't enough horseradish and a bit to vinegary for me. The fries was eh, not much to speak of and one taste of the slaw was all I wanted.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-owensboro-3
Travis W.,"Owensboro, KY",27,24,1,1.0,10/31/2012,"Paid quite a pretty penny just to get extremely sick to my stomach halfway through the meal. Slow service on a not-so busy night (and it looked like there were more than just a couple servers on hand) and subpar food. Let's talk about service. It took forever to order, get our drinks refilled, get our appetizer, get our salad, etc. These things COULD be blamed on the kitchen but it took a good 5+ minutes just to get some steak sauce for my mother's steak. The appetizer wasn't too bad, but not worth $6 for some fried potato slices and queso dip. Salad was okay, decently cold and stuff. But the steak and mashed potatoes, oh God. Just, no. The NY Strip seemed like it had no flavor other than the flavor of the beef itself. Where is the seasoning that makes a good steak a good steak? Not only that but the evening I went, I happened to be dining with my mother. She ordered her sirloin well done and got it medium well. I ordered my strip medium well and got it well done and rather tough compared to steaks i've had elsewhere. The mashed potatoes are not mashed. There are potato chunks and some ""mashed"" potatoes that kind of taste like potato mixed with a LOT of milk. The consistency is gross, like eating chunky vomit. Oh, and did I mention that not even a third of the way through the main course my stomach got extremely upset (and my face got really warm) and I had to make two trips to the restroom within 10 minutes? Cause that happened. I was completely fine before and a couple hours after I got home, it subsided. I don't think it's just a coincidence. I think something about those disgusting potatoes did it. Never again. I will never go here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-owensboro-3
Ryan A.,"Owensboro, KY",7,3,,5.0,9/18/2012,"I don't know about other places, but this Applebee's captures the ""neighborhood"" feel perfectly!  The atmosphere is great with great hospitality by the waiters and waitresses.  You can't beat half-priced appetizers or the trio! The only critique I have is the price of the average entree seems a bit high, but what place isn't now-a-days? Overall great restaurant, great food, great atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-owensboro-3
Fred W.,"Calhoun, KY",14,30,16,3.0,2/6/2012,"Waitress forgot to bring out the appetizer, then gave us the wrong check. Steak was good, but a little to salty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-owensboro-3
Connie W.,"Owensboro, KY",3,19,,1.0,2/7/2013,"Never again! My son and I went here for supper. He ordered the potato twists for an appetizer, and they looked and tasted burnt. The waitress was friendly but service was very slow, and she was not checking back with us about drink refills or steak sauce or if all was well, though it was not busy. We both had steak, i wanted mine well-done and he wanted med-well. I got my steak with blood running out, and it was too gross to eat. His was way too well-done. And the mashed potatoes were disgusting!!! I don't know what they are doing to their so-called mashed potatoes, but they are more like a tasteless, milky potato-salad, with big chunks of potatoes, and a lot of milk. I exchanged them for fries but by the time the fries finally arrived, we were too irritated to stay, and my son had started getting sick right after he started eating. I will never go here again! Wasted a lot of money on GARBAGE.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-owensboro-3
