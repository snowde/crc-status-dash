David K.,"Norway, ME",39,6,,5.0,12/4/2016,"I have never had a great opinion about this restaurant. I've been several time to various locations of Applebee's in Nh and MA but not this one. I went on me and my wife's 2nd month anniversary (yea we love to celebrate our milestones)  I know I was in a great mood already but I went in with no real expectations. The service was excellent! Our server kept up with our drinks levels and checked in just enough to show that she really cared. The food (a full rack of Baby back ribs and the bacon cheddar Mac) was Excellent too! I was for the first time in my life very impressed with this Applebee's. Fortunately, I live quite close and will definitely be back. Maybe the next time I'll save some room for desert even.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-oxford-6
Annie M.,"Bethel, ME",1,9,13,1.0,11/2/2017,"Eaten here numerous times because there is no choice for the area. There is no consistency in quality and the food is full of MSG. We've decided , sadly, McDonalds is a better choice to avoid getting violently sick from the Applebee's food.  On a brighter note, TINA, a waitress there, is amazing!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-oxford-6
Rene C.,"Portland, ME",349,183,569,4.0,11/11/2016,"First off I want to tell everyone that I am a big fan of Applebee's. With that said, I went after work with my friends on Thursday and I ordered their happy hour house margarita and together my friends and I, shared some Buffalo boneless chicken bites, mozzarella sticks and those cute little wonton tacos. The margarita was a bit to tart for my taste. In fact, one of my friends ordered the same drink and throughout our time there, she slowly added margarita to her glass of water. She seemed to enjoy her creative way to lessen the tart flavor and I was delighted when she offered the rest of her drink to me. It was much better than mine and perhaps melted ice diluted the drink and made for a less puckering experience. My other two friends ordered beer and one actually made her very own beer concoction with ice and lime. I tasted it and to be perfectly honest with you all, it tasted just like beer to me. I must reveal here that I am not one that enjoys the many different tastes associated with beer. They really all taste the same to me, sorry beer lovers! Although the margaritas were a bit tart, the food was delicious and all came with the happy hour 1/2 price!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-oxford-6

Christopher D.,"South Paris, ME",3,30,3,3.0,7/27/2016,"It's an Applebees - what more can I say? Tonight I had the Thai shrimp salad, which was delicious and a perfect dinner for a not-overly-hungry man. I was sad they didn't really have any pasta dishes to speak of, but I guess that's not their schtick. Shoutout to my greeter and my server, both of whom were extremely friendly and attentive. Will definitely eat here any time it seems convenient to do so.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-oxford-6

Edward L.,"Norway, ME",51,4,,1.0,9/6/2014,"Wish I could give it no stars....Horrible Car-Side-To-go service!! I have placed 10 different orders with this Applebee's and they have only gotten 2 of them barely right. Not once has any Applebee's employee ever come out to My car; I have ALWAYS had to go in. I order the same thing every time. I order the Oriental Chicken Salad with the fried chicken. Simple enough right ??? Nope ! They screw up the order EVERY TIME !!! I never get utensils or even a napkin. I have complained to management every time and they seem accommodating and usually replace the order or give me my money back but I wish they would just get it right the first time. There are many other better options in & around there so if I were you,..I would pass up this Applebee's and go directly across the street to The Ocean Pearl Chinese Restaurant; MUCH better food AND service !!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-oxford-6
Patrick J.,"Oxford, ME",0,3,1,1.0,6/7/2016,"This place doesnt even deserve 1 star the service is the worse I have ever seen.Went here with the family for my kids 8th grade graduation they never gave us our appitizer,then when they brought out our main dishes they forgot about my kids meal completely.The kid had to take the meal to go because we sat there another 30 minutes waiting on his dish.Im done with this half ass outfit this is the 4th time I have gone there and they screw up the order!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-oxford-6
Anne L.,"Middleton, MA",1,11,,5.0,10/4/2014,"I came here with my family for my nephew's 6th birthday. Their food was delicious, we all ordered different meals and everyone enjoyed theirs. Service was fast and great. The manager is phenomenal! He made my nephew feel so special, a group of waiters brought his cake out singing and clapping. He was so excited. Great food, great service. We will be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-oxford-6
