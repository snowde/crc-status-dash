The Critical J.,"Cresskill, NJ",65,97,,4.0,1/13/2018,"PROS: This is a very lifelike applebees. At night, this place is always jumping mainly with teenagers. Like other Applebees restaurants, the food is great and has a nice menu selection. The bathroom is spacious and very clean. Theres enough parking for everyone in their lot too.  CONS: The place is smaller than other Applebees restaurants! It's size makes it difficult to get a table sometimes. Also, I tried getting a long island ice tea but they rejected my card because it was vertical, even though its not expired and states that I'm 22. I have never been to a place that rejected my card. OVERALL: This place is a decent applebees. Don't expect to much from them but you will definitely enjoy it here. Especially if you're a teen",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-paramus

Our server was very nice and accommodating, albeit a little slow. The food was good. We ordered raspberry martinis because we don't mess around, and I truly hated it. I had to water it down because it was so syrupy. It tasted like a melted lollipop. Then, at the end of our meal, we overheard the server next to us offer his customers $1 long island iced teas. We had no idea that this promotion was going on, otherwise we would not have ordered $9 syrup drinks.

Emma R.,"Waldwick, NJ",67,9,2,1.0,1/4/2018,"Let me start of by saying the manager is terrible. My boyfriend and I went to dinner last night. We ordered the 2 appetizers for 10 something. Chicken wanton tacos and the beer pretzel pub. We got 6 pretzels delivered to our table. We start eating and the waiter comes over and tells us that the appetizer was only supposed to come with 4 pretzels, I'm going to have to bring 2 pretzels back. Let me just say who brings food to our table and then says they need to take it away. We then ask to speak to the manager. The manager made our server try to take the 2 pretzels away. She then comes over and tries to take the pretzels away and we argue and argue and then she charges us for three appetizers for 14 something instead of two appetizers for 10 something. She should of just gave the 2 pretzels to us for free. It was there mistake on there end. BAD SERVICE. THE MANAGER IS NOT IN ANY POSITION TO BE MANAGER. FIRE HER! Everyone doesn't like her.

I have been coming to this establishment since I was a young child and I have never heard such a ""policy"" in my life. Third of all, the plates were dirty when they were given to us and we had to send them back. After we sent our plates back it took about 30 minutes for us to receive our food again.

Came here with co-workers with big appetites on one of those busy highschool football game nights. (Friday or Saturday usually) it's quite the mess of juvenile obnoxious kids during these days BUT Applebee's was able to keep up with service, refilling our drinks and bringing out all our food which filled an entire table for 6- and quite promptly I might add.

My bf's plate came out cold, and he ordered a pint of beer but was served a bottle. I asked for extra sauce with one of our dishes, that never came. And my utensils that came wrapped in a napkin were missing a knife. To top it off the restaurant was freezing cold, and for me that's rare considering I'm always too warm.

G D.,"Paramus, NJ",0,2,,1.0,6/2/2017,"Unfortunately 0 stars is not an option, or else that is certainly the rating I would choose. I'm extremely disgusted and disappointed with the service that I experienced tonight during my Applebee's visit. As a frequent customer the past 4 years and having spent an obscene amount of money here during that time period, it is a shame that one of the managers (the tall fat one with the long slicked back greasy hair and glasses) felt the need to be one of the rudest human beings I've ever met. After eating normal dinner elsewhere, my friends and I came here because our friend wanted to get her favorite dessert for her birthday. We nicely asked our waiter to sing to her and when they didn't we asked the manager why. He said and I quote: ""Maybe if you guys actually ordered some food instead of sitting here and taking up space (note that there was nobody waiting to be seated at this time) then we could do that for you"". 1. Two of my friends ordered a dessert which they were paying for and 2. If singing was such a problem he could have put it in a gentler, nicer manner considering he is speaking to customers. Last time I checked that isn't the correct way to do so. Telling us that we're basically a waste of space is just a bit insulting, don't ya think???",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-paramus

I think when you go to this place your expectations are not too high to begin with. You know exactly what you get in theory! This place is located in shopping center which is really the only reason you would swing by this place. I am sure if I was 16 again I would think this place is great but sadly I am way past that age. To be this place is just not hitting the spot. Plus I always feel like everything is sticky (menus and tables) and needs a good cleaning. The food is just blah - you know they are heading it up in a microwave in the back. Strangely their wings are the only thing that actually seem to be good but then again you only need to heat those up. If you are in a pinch and just need some quick food - or are with kids - this place will probably work for you. However being on Route 17 were there are 100 other options, I would suggest another one. I will say the service is always nice and friendly!!

George C.,"East Orange, NJ",111,64,3,1.0,4/6/2015,"Went here on Friday night and you would have thought they were screening the new Fast and Furious movie by the amount of preteens at this place. I was expecting to see Chris Hansen pop up and bust a potential child predator. I'm a creature of habit so I order the same thing every time I go there (American Standard Burger). It's not too bad but I don't understand why they don't have Angry Orchard on tap like other Applebee's locations. It's close to my job and convenient for the late night hunger craving.  Pros:  - Food is okay when you're hungry, it's late, and you have nowhere else to go. - Location and Parking. Cons:  - They seem to give less fries than they use to give before. Another Visit:  Went there today 5/2/15 and ordered a Triple Bacon Burger w/ Sweet Potatoe Fries to go. I get to work and opened the bag to see they put my fries in this little bag (similar to what Starbucks uses for pastries). There must have been like 13 fries in the bag. I guess if I was a Hobbit or a triple bypass surgery patient this would be enough but 13 fries really? Yes, I counted them as I ate them. There were small tiny pieces in the bottom which were the burned ones I guess. I remember when they used to give you a sizable portion of fries.

When I was a mall rat I would walk here with all my other mall rat friends to make it for the half off appitizers at 10pm. I think it is safe to say I may as well been on the payroll I was there so much. Mind you this was when I was about 11-16 years old, after we stuffed our faces we'd wait for our parents to come pick us up and drive all of us home.  It was my friends suggestion to come here and I was very happy he made us come here. We were a little annoyed with how our waiter had an attitude but watever we didnt let his negativity rouin our experience. We started off by ordering our drinks and looking over the menu for our appitizers. We chose to order the spinach artichoke dip which is one of my favorites mmm along with the potatoe twisters that come with a cheese dipping sauce. We also ordered the build your own samplers with the pretzels and beer cheese dip, bonless buffalo wings and the tower things that sucked womp womp.  All of our food came out promptly for the appitizers at least. We ordered our meals I got the 9oz sirloin with mashed potatoes and a side salad it was very good. Two of my other friends got the 4 cheese mac and cheese with chicken fingers atop it.

Michael L.,"Waldwick, NJ",48,359,141,2.0,8/9/2012,"Egad, how can you mess up beer?!?

Everything else is Applebee's food.  If you expect anything else, then you're off your rocker. The service is okay, no one going the extra mile, and the occasional wrong order showing up at the table.  It's a good place to get hired if you're looking for a job to hold you over this economy.  The place already developed a reputation for mistakes, so new hires are just as competent as the veterans.

Maxine M.,"San Francisco, CA",4,10,,1.0,7/22/2013,"I wouldn't normally bother writing a review of a chain restaurant--you pretty much know what you're gonna get when you walk in--but I had an especially interesting experience here.  I came here with my boyfriend when we were visiting his family in New Jersey.  We saw the Onion headline (""New Ad Urges Hipsters To Go To Applebee's Ironically"") about Applebee's and started reminiscing about going to Applebee's in our high school days, when we visited much less ironically.  So we get here and get seated quickly.  Waitress seems nice, if a little slow.  I start browsing the ridiculous drink menu and order some cocktail that has a name like a city in the Spongebob universe. Nuclear Baja Azul Ginsplosiontini or something absurd. My boyfriend orders a beer.   This is when things get weird. The waitress takes our IDs, studies them for a good minute or so.  Not really sure why we had to help her find the dates of birth, that's the most prominent thing on the ID.  I'm from California and my boyfriend is from Washington state, neither of which are podunk states.  I imagine she's at least seen a California ID before.   So she goes off to get our drinks.  A few minutes later she returns and asks to see them again.  This is a little odd, I don't like giving anyone my ID and letting them run off with it, but whatever.  Also I'm 26 and my boyfriend is 29, so we're not exactly the spitting image of youth. Then five minutes later the manager, who looks younger than either of us, comes over and tells us he can't take them.  ""Why?"" I ask, as I'm sure you would have. He goes on to explain that some element of my ID was slightly wrong or off and my boyfriend's ID had some tiny discrepancy between how his book said it should look. ""They're real IDs,"" I say, as I'm sure you would have at this point.  ""Did you put them under the blacklight?"" ""Yes,"" he says, which was likely a lie.  ""Okay,"" I say, and then we argued for a minute about it.  We were only 15 miles from the most cosmopolitan city in the world, it seemed unusual that a Paraman would be incapable of recognizing an ID from CALIFORNIA, the largest state in our country population-wise.  At this point I didn't even want nor care about my Thermonuclear Gin-tanamo Torturetini™ anymore.  It was all about preserving pride. Anyway, he went on to insinuate that we were attempting to scam them, and said they'd call the police and have them confiscate our IDs.  As funny as it would have been to see the mental midget of a manager get his comeuppance, we didn't have the patience for that, so we bounced.  As an added pleasantry, the manager shouted ""good luck using your fake ID elsewhere!"" as we walked out. I'd be so curious to actually talk to the manager here and hear what the hell they were smoking.  While an apology might be nice, I'd settle for an explanation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-paramus?start=20
Adam J.,"Paramus, NJ",0,6,,1.0,3/4/2016,"Place has really declined. Went and ordered a 2 for $20 meal and an additional burger during happy hour sitting bye the bar. We got a $4.50 Long Island Iced tea, a house Merlot, and a Mountain Dew. Well the Long Island was absolutely disgusting, hardly a drop of alcohol, the Merlot was a given to us as a Chardonnay. That's just the beginning. When we asked the waitress for a Merlot, as we originally ordered, she got a nasty look on her face. We then ordered dinner, the 2 for $20. One being a small sirloin steak (Med Rare) which clearly says its $2 extra on the menu with loaded mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables. Well the small amount of cheese and bacon was also $2 extra and not mentioned bye the waitress or menu. The steak was completely raw. I sent it back while the waitress scooped the steak off my plate with the sides still on it leaving it for me while I waited a good 10 minutes to the manager bringing me a new plate with fresh sides on it. He asked me if I would like to cut into it while he was there, and I did, and it was even more rare then the first one. I mean who can't cook a medium rare steak, I do it every week and I'm not a chef or cook? I said I'm done I'll just take a burger to take home medium cooked. Well, when I went to eat it later it was also raw. I'd never order anything but an appetizer or sandwich at this location.

Carla L.,"New York, NY",120,240,22,1.0,1/15/2013,"The food here is disgusting. Considering that it's Applebee's and the majority of the food on the menu arrives in the kitchen pre-packaged, pre-cooked, pre-seasoned, etc., you have to be a really bad cook to screw things up. Yet they do.  Tonight, I ordered my favorite thing on the Applebee's menu - the chicken wonton tacos appetizer - and there were large chunks of burnt grizzle in the chicken, the cilantro and cabbage topping which should be on and in the tacos, was haphazardly tossed around the food. It's also supposed to come with fresh limes, but they gave me lemons. Major difference when it comes to Mexican, or pseudo-Mexican food. It was the kind of food experience where you question the cleanliness and safety of the food that you're eating which is never a good thing... I've eaten here a few other times before this and the food is always sub-par compared to other Applebee's. Tonight was most likely my last time coming here.

The food is great, the service is incredible no matter who serves you. They are terrific with kids and the manager always stops at the table to say hi. We know we will have a great experience when we go to the Paramus Fashion Center location ( we have not had good luck at the Hackensack location, poor customer service, no personalities, no management presence).

Aside from her, the wait staff is usually garbage. They'll take your order, bring you your food, and then disappear. You literally need to hunt them down. This has happened with multiple servers.

So while I can't speak for the evening service, I can talk about the day's! Very friendly greetings as you walk in, doesn't seem fake like other places. Sure it is their job, but still...credit where it's due! Bartender seems to be on top of things but the other day I ran into one that was always putting a napkin under my drink....it was a little weird.  I usually order a sandwich, my friend usually gets the boneless wings. Wings are always fantastic here! Again, it's a chain, I know! I had the chicken and bacon sandwich which was a first for me and it was spot on...except for one thing. When you say smothered in bacon...2 pieces is not adequate....besides, who doesn't like bacon?

Susan P.,"Fort Lee, NJ",0,14,,1.0,11/22/2012,"I am only doing a review for this Applebees. (I like the other ones). You CANNOT get a bottle of wine in this place!! Absolutely ridiculous. You ask them what they have in a bottle. When you order it, they tell you they don't carry it anymore. Then you ask them again what they do have. They come back and tell you they ""just ran out."" It's pointless. If you want wine, you have to order it by the glass, and then you're lucky if it's fresh. Yucch. Don't even get me started on the lack of service. I spoke to the regional manager, who was very nice and assured me that he would address this issue. I don't really think the store manager listened. I went back again and the same exact scenario played out. Never again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-paramus?start=40

Kate L.,"Hillsdale, NJ",48,214,,2.0,10/22/2009,"While I've never had a terrible experience here, I've never had a great one either.  I met my cousin for dinner and drinks tonight at her request and the place was packed.  We scooted into two bar stools and parked ourselves for an hour.... An hour. That was it. While fussing like teenage girls over the announcement of her engagement, the bartender barked at us ""What do you want for drinks!?!""  We paused, looked at each other and ordered. Then went back to fussing.  Not much later, ""Are you ready to order!?!?"" We had barely looked at the menus and asked her to come back.  ""Are you ready now!?!?""  And so the scene continued every 5-10 minutes for the next hour when we were hurried out the door at 8pm as the restaurant was beginning to empty. Had we been taking up a table or just sitting at the bar not eating/drinking, I could understand the bartender wanting to move us along. But we ordered drinks, apps, dinner and dessert in under an hour.  If she kept refilling us/spaced it out better, we would have been there much longer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-paramus?start=40
Jessica K.,"Hillsdale, NJ",21,349,53,3.0,2/22/2010,"The appetizers & bar are the best reasons to go to any Applebee's, but especially this one. In my experience, going on Sunday afternoons, the bartenders are usually friendly, quick to attend, and ensure ordered food comes out on time. If you chose to (and are able to) sit at the bar like I did, it really maximizes the relaxed, casual vibe I think the establishment is going for.  Of course, most of the main entrees are covered in sauces and unnecessary extras. If you can go without something, I suggest making that request when you order your main dish.  Again, anything fried is superb here. I can't get enough of their mozzarella sticks (10 individual sticks in one order!) and buffalo wings. I never fail to wash'em down with a pint of beer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-paramus?start=40
Linda M.,"Nanuet, NY",8,46,21,1.0,8/5/2010,"What an absolute nightmare.  I have never had such a bad experience at a chain restaurant.  This was the first time I was at this place, and I'm sure it will be my last.   We went on a Thursday night.  The place was busy but not packed.  We were seated immediately.  The waitress took our order.  And about 10 minutes later, she came with our drinks.  We were a party of 2... so 2 sodas....BUT only 1 straw.  So I waited, and waited.  Finally she came back and I asked for a straw.  Apparently she had dropped it on the floor.  So she took another out of her apron and handed it to me.  Then, she pick up the one off the floor and put it back in her apron.  YUCK!  20 minutes later, our appetizer came out.... but no plates.  So we just ate.  Then our entrees came out... but no utensils.  I was getting kind of frustrated.  So I asked the waitress for utensils.  It took her 15 minutes to get back to us, but on the way, she left utensils at the wrong table.  So we waited again.  It took her an additional 10 minutes to finally bring our utensils.  By this time, our food was cold.  Drinks were empty.  I asked for a container to take my food home.  What else is new, it took the waitress an additional 10 minutes to fetch a container... yet our check was brought to us immediately.
