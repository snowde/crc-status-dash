K M.,"Elburn, IL",0,8,,1.0,5/10/2015,"Came here for Mother's Day. Service was horrible. I don't think there were any managers there ""minding the store"". Food was ok.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pewaukee-3?start=20
Brad B.,"Pewaukee, WI",0,2,,1.0,12/27/2014,"The worse service I have ever experienced. I used the curbside takeout last week and it could have been any worse. After calling $90 worth of food the server brought me one bag. I immediately question the single bag and was told everything was in the bag and she went back inside. I looked through the bag and notice four entrees missing. I called inside, only to find that she forgot a bag. The bag came out with no apology, but an excuse that her manger messes up the order. After arriving home it became clear here was still an entree missing. I called and of course it was sitting safely at the restaurant. I returned to the restaurant to pick up the final entree and was once again told the manager is always messing up her orders and if I wanted to talk with him I would have to wait. I returned home to eat with my family only to find out the soup and 2 other entrees were incorrect. I will not be returning. Their are a lot of choices on Capital Dr. I would avoid this one!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pewaukee-3?start=20
Lori K.,"Sussex, WI",10,7,,4.0,7/12/2013,"After having a really bad evening at Applebees in Pewaukee and Menomonee Falls, I contacted their corporate headquarters online and left them a comment about my service. The next day, I was contacted by the manager of the Pewaukee location and asked about my service the day prior. I told him what happened, and unfortunately could not remember my servers name (it's important for them to have names, people, but me, like a dummy,  could not remember), and he apologized for giving us bad service. He also very generously offered us a voucher for 2 free entrees, and invited us back for another try. I received the voucher about a day later, and we went back last weekend. The food and service was excellent, even before I showed them the voucher, so I am honestly feeling much better about this place. It could have just been a bad night the first time, or bad employees, but the whole place seemed much more business-like and the food was even presented and made better than the time before. Hats off to Applebees in Pewaukee for making corrections - I will gladly be back in the future!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pewaukee-3?start=20
Connor T.,"Corona, CA",0,9,1,5.0,1/15/2015,"Josh T. was a great server, very friendly and polite, and looked like he enjoyed himself unlike the many servers out there that look like in that restaurant is the last place they want to be. He got both of me and my girlfriends orders correct and kept our drinks filled the duration of the meal. He did forget, however, to mention the drink of the day and we should have taken advantage of the free app that Applebee's offers if their servers forget to mention it but I couldn't care less. Great meal and great burger very satisfied with this experience! Great job Josh!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pewaukee-3
John G.,"Ixonia, WI",0,10,,1.0,11/26/2017,If I could leave A lower score I would!   This place is a joke!  We got seated and it took over 30 minutes to get our drinks!   And they only had 2 other tables in the whole place.  ( my wife had to go and grab them of the bar area).   Out of Mozzarella Sticks... Really!  / food at best was a 1 out of 10,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pewaukee-3
Aimee T.,"Sussex, WI",61,211,54,1.0,12/2/2016,Don't do it!!!  Crappy service.  Crappy food. I'm now going to start calling it Crapplebee's.  if you hate your job so much find a new one. Don't inflict the general population with your negative attitude. My Chinese chicken salad was basically cabbage and carrots. Where is the lettuce hiding?  My hubby's sandwich was soggy and gross.  There are a lot of other options in the area. We will be trying those instead of Crapplebee's again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pewaukee-3
Brian S.,"Pewaukee, WI",10,4,2,1.0,6/20/2017,"Barely anyone in restaurant. Waited over an hour and they tried to give me a totally different entree than I ordered. Families food was overcooked.  Staff hangs out at bar and socializes.  While waiting, bartender yells to manager ""come here I gotta pee"".   No apologies, concessions, understanding etc. for wrong order, wait etc.  manager hangs at bar and socializes also and failed to come to our table to say anything.  Waited  another 15 minutes for my corrected entree before I gave up, canceled and left.  Do yourself a favor, stay home and throw in a frozen pizza...it will be better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pewaukee-3
John H.,"Pewaukee, WI",2,11,2,3.0,11/29/2016,Stopped in for ordering something to go. The gal and Carside To Go was awesome. Very friendly and very helpful. Went out to the bar to grab a beer while they were making my food. The bartenders need a lesson in customer service. Not very friendly or sociable. The kind of things that make customers want to leave a nice tip. Hint hint. I left the tip for the gal at Carside To Go.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pewaukee-3
Ari V.,"Brookfield, WI",266,3,,5.0,2/15/2017,Mitch was our server on valentine's day and he did an amazing job. Made the experience for my friends and myself that much better!! He really vibed with our table and took great care of us. Having a server with his personality really makes a resteraunt better. You go mitch! Will be back for half priced apps only if he's working! :) ps. Told ya id write a review for ya!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pewaukee-3
Terese S.,"Eagle, WI",0,10,,2.0,11/29/2016,"This location seems to have difficulty with staff turnover and the service really suffers because of it.  I work close by and we use to come to this Applebee's often, but we have stopped doing so because of the slow service and long wait times to get a server.   We have left the restaurant 3 times without ordering after sitting for 15 to 30 mins with no one coming to take a drink order.  The food is similar to the same quality at any other Applebee's I have been to, but the service definitely is lacking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pewaukee-3
Cheryl M.,"Muskego, WI",0,3,,4.0,8/7/2016,Was there this past Friday. Husband had fish fry which he said was just ok. I had the crispy brewhouse chicken & was very good. On downside was after we ordered we noticed we were there earlier enough for 1/2 price appetizers that waitress never mentioned.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pewaukee-3
Jeff S.,"Roselle, IL",0,48,1,4.0,3/20/2016,"Okay the hostess was totally clueless, we had a party of 6 and her response was to giggle and say she couldn't tell us how long. After someone came to help her we were seated within minutes. The food was good and it was prepared just as we asked. I would definitely go back and it's a shame they closed all the Chicago locations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pewaukee-3
William T.,"Waukesha, WI",0,8,,1.0,6/28/2016,Sitting here 10 minutes and nobody has acknowledged our group yet. The place isn't busy.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pewaukee-3
Boyd R.,"Arlington, TX",23,8,,2.0,7/26/2015,Took the family yesterday. Very few patrons there when we went. Took 10 minutes to be acknowledged. Took over 20 minutes to get our food. We were not well attended at all. It's never pleasant to be ignored. This place is poorly managed and staff seems inexperienced. Manager was there but did not engage anyone. We will avoid this place from now on.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pewaukee-3
Sara S.,"New Berlin, WI",23,112,24,4.0,3/16/2015,Applebee's is Applebee's.  This review is on how this Applebee's compares to the other Applebee's.  Their staff is consistantly friendly and attentive.  Food comes out promptly and cooked well.  Restaurant is clean.  Done.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pewaukee-3
Merinah P.,"Waukesha, WI",9,36,10,3.0,8/21/2015,"They had a very nice environment there and it was family friendly. They offered the usual large menu for adults, my grandma was disappointed with the menu change because her usual order (oriental chicken salad) didn't taste the same. Also the server never asked how she wanted her chicken. My friend got the brunch burger which she loved! Also half a burger was plenty for her. And I ordered off the kids menu, the really really hungry menu (nice to see they had 2 kids menu), mine came with 5 fried shrimp, cocktail sauce and I got my side (plenty to choose from) of vanilla yogurt and strawberries. We enjoyed our food-minus my grandma, and had a decent enough server with technical difficulties. I would go again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pewaukee-3
Ziggy R.,"Sussex, WI",2,15,,1.0,2/7/2016,Worst kerb side on line experience - 20 minutes late - then no fries or coleslaw when i got home - and ribs were burnt to a crisp. Never again!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pewaukee-3
Jeff C.,"Copernicus Park, Milwaukee, WI",11,76,1,2.0,7/16/2013,Food (lemon shrimp fettuccine) 4 stars - 5 with just a few more shrimp added; theyre not that big. Having to go to bar to get my Pepsi refilled 0 stars. Pet peeve? Yes! Unreasonable when server has two tables? No! When I was at the bar I noticed my server and 3-4 others laughing it up in a booth. No apologies from her (Kelly) - totally ridiculous. Manager made it right with a phone call. Will revisit and hope changes are made!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pewaukee-3
Jin L.,"Pewaukee, WI",4,42,11,4.0,5/15/2014,Been coming here since 2002. Great for late night meals. Staff is always friendly. They try their best to be prompt with your food. The food it self is good and filling. Traditional American fair nothing to shout about but good enough. The food is cooked well and comes out hot.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pewaukee-3
Mike V.,"Pewaukee, WI",24,31,9,5.0,8/24/2012,Great service and friendly staff! Plus it was newly remodeled and looks amazing at night!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pewaukee-3
Mary H.,"Slinger, WI",1,12,12,3.0,2/1/2014,"Alright, I know it's not cool to go to big corporate chain restaurants -- but if we're being honest they serve their purpose.  And the Pewaukee Applebee's was not bad at all, actually it was just fine.  The place was chosen because of its location.  Halfway for both me and the friend I was meeting for a quick dinner.  Since neither of us lives in the area, Applebee's seemed like a safe choice.  This was more about having a chance to chat and catch up but we were both perfectly happy with our food.  I had a BLT with fries and my friend had some sort of crispy chicken bowl.  The atmosphere was good for a relatively quiet conversation.  Our waitress was very attentive and cheery.  And the price was reasonable (my bill came to ~$20 for my sandwich and fries--oh yeah and two beers).  I would go back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pewaukee-3
Kelly G.,"Jackson, WI",1,21,,2.0,2/11/2014,"Applebee's use to be such a treat. Not anymore. If you couldn't get a beer here I would go to a fast food restaurant. Fiesta lime chicken seems microwaved. Drenched in greasy cheese. Dried out horrible tasting rice. Staff pleasant enough when you can track them down even though there's about 10 tables with people and as many servers. Bartender and servers do nothing but socialize with each other in loud voices like they're at a party not a job. Guess what bartender I don't care that you ""didn't get to the straws yet.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pewaukee-3
Jean O.,"Waukesha, WI",8,2,,1.0,9/3/2015,My husband and I had lunch here yesterday. We have been to other Applebee's before and enjoyed the food. This was not the case yesterday. I had ordered soup and an entree. When my entrée came out I still hadn't seen my soup. When I asked our server about it she said that she thought I wanted it with my entree. Well then where was it? 5 to 7 minutes later she came out with my soup. Why didn't she just fess up that she forgot it? I was tempted to tell her to just keep it but didn't and I'm glad I didn't . . . it was the best thing I ordered. My steak was overcooked and had an old meat taste to it. The garlic mashed potatoes were gelatinous and only lukewarm. My raspberry iced tea was so weak you could hardly taste any raspberry. No manager in site even though a sign at the door said they were there. Totally disappointing experience. It's going to take a while to even think about ever going back here again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pewaukee-3
