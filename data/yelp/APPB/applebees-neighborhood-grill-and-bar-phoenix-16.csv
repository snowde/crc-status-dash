Jeremy R.,"Scottsdale, AZ",102,24,7,5.0,8/11/2017,"Came in real late , almost closing time. We were welcomed by Sam our waitress. She had a huge smile and an amazingly friendly personality. She never mentioned the time or made us feel rushed. Sam was spot on the food and drinks. Fast!     We also noticed the other employees where smiling and having pleasant exchanges.     This team works impressively well together!        Thank you Applebees team.    YOU MY BOY BLUE!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phoenix-16
Michael L.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,2,,5.0,11/30/2017,Location is closed. Looks like a leasing issue. Note on door says property has been takin over by landlord.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phoenix-16
Spencer E.,"Cave Creek, AZ",450,2,1,1.0,2/3/2017,"I only go out to eat once a month and I decided Applebees was it.  I only gave it a star because it require me to rate it but I feel it deserves a half stare. After eating here I don't think I'll be back anytime soon.  It started with a phone call. They said there was no wait. That should have been my first clue, for a Friday night rush. When we get there 3 mins later there is actually a 15 minuet wait. You cannot tell me that in 3 mins 4-5 tables came in all of a sudden.  Then came the ordering. The waitress messed up my drinks, also had to ask for water 3 times before I got some. We ordered appetizers when we ordered drinks.   Appetizers took an hour to get and 1:3 were cold and only a partial portion 3 tacos and not 4.  At that point my table asked for a manager. The manager said it was a coaching experience for the waitress. Did not apologize and blames the computer for the issue. And rudely said (eye role heard in her voice about the partial appetizer comment) ""let me go get that last taco for you.""  When our food was arriving the waitress said the potato would take about her 5 min. The person who got the potato said ""I don't want a potato microwaved"". I agree with her statement. If you go out you should not be getting a potato microwaved.   The steak was hard as a brick and the grilled veggies were solid half slabs not sliced and they were raw in the middle.  The waitress said there would be 4 grilled veggies and the woman only got two labs of squash and 3 red pepper slices.  So the ""manager"" said ""I'll go back and get you another side"" in the most Obnoxious tone I've ever heard. I have no idea how she can be a manager. I feel like our waitress was more a manager than the actual manager even though she was slow.  As soon as she realized our irritation  she became more attentive.  In the end we got one meal taken off which is the least they could do.  I will never be back to this one. I know a better one in central phx I will be glade to drive an extra 30 mins to go to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phoenix-16
Michelle B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",129,7,,1.0,10/21/2017,I'll give this one star because I have to but honestly they deserve not even half a star. My boyfriend and I just sat in this restaurant for almost 25minutes and didn't even have waters yet or have an order taken. Took10 minutes for someone to even greet us and I was amazed considering how many employees were standing around (including managers) and not one was providing any help or appearing to be a team atmosphere. Especially considering there was maybe 3 tables in there and over 7 staff members standing around talking. Coming from someone in this industry I can say that I am beyond disappointed with how poor this place is ran. 90% of a restaurants reputation is the service provided and in 25minutes I can say the lack of service speaks for itself. Step it up and look into new staff.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phoenix-16

Kim P.,"Phoenix, AZ",41,26,,1.0,10/28/2017,"We went here last night for dinner, and I have to say our waitress was horrific! She did not check on us once, had a very nasty personality and was very rude and snippy to our entire group of 5 and a infant. As we watched all the other servers make rounds and smile and be kind, our waitress had a stone face and her personality sucked! in fact, she did not even tell us her name. I personally had a burger, and  the bun was very burnt and hard. my daughter did not like her meal at all, it was tasteless and bland. We waited 20 minutes to ask about our bill and a box for take home for the dogs. Today, I wake up throwing up with severe stomach pain. Horrible food and service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phoenix-16
Mary H.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,19,3,1.0,7/24/2017,So I came here for dinner tonight and I just wanna say the service here is beyond ridiculous.  We got here at 9pm and the place was dead. Ordered our drinks right away and didn't get them until 930pm ONLY because I had to wave down our waitress (who spent most of the night talking to the bartender). She apologized and said she forgot. Yeah because she was so busy in a deserted restaurant.  Are you kidding me? Our food came out and looked like it had been sitting out for awhile. The manager looked like a moron just walking around with his thumb in his ass. All in all the place needs to get it together and get formal training in customer service. So disappointed. I'll never return to this location EVER. Stay away from this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phoenix-16
Chris B.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,8,,1.0,11/18/2017,Went there and was seated immediately. Waited 15 mins for the waitress to come just to take out drink order. The place was empty. Maybe 8 customers between two waitress. Food came out and part of it was cold. Would not go to this place again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phoenix-16
Jeff B.,"Phoenix, AZ",39,328,174,2.0,9/3/2015,"First time at this Applebee's and most likely, my last. I arrived at 11:45 on a Thursday for lunch and there were about 8 other guests.  I was greeted/seated right away and Jenn took care of me with all the proper etiquette. The food was the disappointment.  I ordered the Lunch Combo Signature Special: Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad plus French Onion Soup. It arrived in about five minutes. Hmm, a little too fast? The soup was decent: it had all the right components such as good broth, onions, big crouton and cheese. Thankfully it wasn't too salty like many places. The salad was awful. It arrived with a stale, tasteless breadstick and the dressing was so scant I actually thought the cook forgot it and had to look under the first layer of lettuce. The chicken was boring and all around, would never recommend the salad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phoenix-16

Daniel S.,"San Diego, CA",0,24,1,2.0,10/20/2016,"Third and last time I come here.  Walked in and was greeted immediately which is a first for here and I thought a good sign.  No, I was being escorted by the host and mentioned I was going to sit by the bar. Once he heard that he'd walked away without saying a word. Very rude, he could have said something simple like thank you and sit where you want. Every time I come here there is a funky smell in the building. I thought it was coming from the bar but last (2nd time I was here) I sat away and it smells throughout the building. I ordered the steak with parmigiana shrimp, it was tasty but very poorly presented. It looked nowhere like the picture in the menu let alone the garlic mashed potatoes were from a box.  Overall disappointing on many levels. Poor customer service, funky smell and ok food. Definitely avoid this place there are many other options locally that have better reviews.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phoenix-16
Ana P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,5.0,8/5/2017,The manager Ben greeted us when we walked in and at the end of our dinner he came to our table and introduced himself.

Krystal G.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,10,1,1.0,9/9/2016,"Probably the WORST restaurant experience my entire family has ever had. We waited for over 30min just for our appetizer, then 30mins later they brought out 1 plate of food to a table of 4. And the food was BURNT! So burnt they shouldn't have even brought it out. So we send it back to the kitchen. We wait ANOTHER 15min, finally decide to get up and head to the TGI's around the corner from this place. They offered to cover the appetizers and apologized but there was no excuse for such crappy service when the place was more than half empty. Will NEVER Come back!

Corey L.,"Pine Bush, NY",58,66,75,2.0,8/30/2016,"This was the first and last time I go to Applebee's. We wanted to go out for a decent dinner and figured a chain like Applebee's would be good. As we first walked into this place the smell was not so good. I could not recall the smell but it was not that of a restaurant.  We get our seat and look at the menu.  The waitress takes our order, and then goes on to explain we chose great meals. She wishes she could afford what we ordered. She also gave us a sense that she did not like her job. So I assume the pay at Applebee's is subpar, or her productivity is of the same level. As she walked away she looked to the hostess and said I need to smoke lets go. I'm sure the management does not have a clue of how bad you truly are.  I ordered a medium steak, to my surprise I get a rare steak. My wife orders a medium well steak and gets a medium. This lets me know the chef has no idea what he is doing in the back and the training program is below par. I would have sent it back but this place looked to like one of them that you would get more than you asked for.  As we go to pay, which now is a machine because the waitresses are so busy talking crap about everyone to take my payment. Anyway, they tried to charge me double on my drinks. The waitress went back to the manager 3 times before they finally took my credit card and manually ran it with the proper bill.  I am completely unimpressed with this Applebee's. I also assume that this chain has fallen off the caring list. There is a lot of work that needs to be done. If you are looking for a nice dinner and good atmosphere please look elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phoenix-16
Olivia R.,"Peoria, AZ",21,5,,1.0,3/15/2017,"I have visited this location on multiple occasions and every time the experience has been horrible. Last night was the final straw, this place is definitely in need of new management and a visit from corporate. Yesterday the place was an igloo absolutely freezing. The crew members were supervising the store with no manager in sight. The food took 50 minutes to be served to us, and came out ice cold. Overall, avoid this place at all cost.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phoenix-16

Rubbie S.,"Manor, TX",59,516,2074,1.0,11/1/2015,"Ok where do I start...  The table Looks clean but when you put your hands on it . It'sticky...Eww!! We were seated right away. Offered different places to sit. Not many people in restaurant. It was about 1145 am on Sunday morning. We placed our orders  person #1 French onion soup  & Ice Tea person #2 Bacon Cheese burger  ( No onions ) with Fries and Ice Tea Person #3  The Brunch Burger ( No Onions & No ketchup ) fries  & Pepsi Person #4 Burger  ( No Cheese ) fries and Ice Tea 20-30 minutes go bye. We watch people walk in after after us and be serve their food before us and we're still waited for our food.  When we were finally served we were not served all together. Person #1 had to wait for no reason Person #3 Fries were luke warm and egg shells in burger Person #4 Burger had cheese  ( Even though they specifically asked for no cheese) fries luke warm. Person #2 Burger was missing they were only given fries 7 minutes later the burger was brought out with NO Bacon. The waitress accepted responsibility in the delay in our food.  How ever between missing the  bacon on the bacon cheese burger. The waitress said she was going to send the manager over so we could speak with him.  The manager Never came over and spoke with us.... so much for Customer Service. The waitress (christine) is not sole blame for bad service or food. I felt  ignored and purposely over looked by the manager Chris. Who had no problem stopping at other tables but ignoring ours.  Instead the waitress gave us the bill for the food. Thankfully  minus the charge for person #2 burger.  How ever I still feel slighted or over looked because the manager never made an attempt to check on us or speak to us. The waitress apologized numerous times but her apologies didn't make the food come out any quicker, or stop the missing items. By the time she was attentive to our drink refills we were already upset and they took the path of ignoring us instead of facing the problem face on. I don't write negative reviews on a regular basis so this is probably the worst one I've ever written. I will never visit this restaurant ever again I do not recommend it to anybody else.  Unless your in to being ignored, over looked or food being served to you not the way you order it! So rather then throw a fit or demand to be seen and heard I brought my words and opinions here. I am not the type of person to not leave a tip. for $39.00 bill I left a $5.00 tip (Begrudgingly) But followed through by sharing my experience here on Yelp and Facebook.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phoenix-16?start=20
Tobi B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,13,,5.0,11/27/2016,My husband and I went in last night for half price appetizers. The food was good but what stood out most was the outstanding service we received.

Aj F.,"Orem, UT",0,4,,5.0,11/27/2016,"Applebee's is Applebee's right? I don't think that it happens often enough that the people doing well in their service roles get the credit they deserve. We love going to this location because of two employees in particular. Lessa and Spencer ALWAYS go above and beyond what would be expected of a server. They seem to have an innate sense of exactly how often to check in on a table. It never seems forced or over the top. They are always genuine and proactive about making sure everything is perfect. Doesn't matter what time it is or how many tables they are handling.

I ordered a shrimp stir fry dish but it came with steak. Our waitress apologized for the mistake and the manager also came over to the table and apologized.

You used to at least be able to count on them for a cheap happy hour booze & food wise. Not so much any more, there are barely any choices & it's mostly stuff people don't want to drink. Service was impeccably slow, 45 minutes to get our entrees. Margarita tasted like the kind that comes in those Capri Sun like pouches.  Everything tastes as unfresh as it is. The only saving grace was the French fries were fresh, even if only one sad, lone fry came seasoned.

Brad W.,"Scottsdale, AZ",203,1520,1960,4.0,6/14/2015,"This chain has about five menu's as well, but I was here for lunch, so you just simply head to the back side of the menu and start picking your combo. Your lunch will either be $7-$9 depending on what combination of items you pick. I think I nailed it with my selection of the chicken cheese penne bake and the chipotle chicken wrap. They are lunch portion sized, but it filled me up quite nicely. The pasta had nice strips of white chicken grilled on top and wasn't overly cheesy while the wrap had enough flavor on its own, but was helped by an orange dipping sauce (chipotle). You can get out of here under $10 for lunch, but the quality all depends on what you pick.

Thomas S.,"Phoenix, AZ",21,85,7,4.0,11/5/2015,"So this was a tough review to write. About 10 years ago, I got a very bad case of food poisoning from an Applebee's. I was violently ill for about 48 hrs.  Needless to say, every time I heard the name, I would think of the Asian chicken salad I had ordered, and how something didn't seem right with it.  Then, I think of the pain I was in, and the violent vomiting and bowel movements I had for 2 days. Again, it goes without saying, that I avoided Applebees for a very long time. My ex finally convinced me to try it again, as their menu had changed a lot, and had some new items on it. So I gave it a try. WOW.  I ordered the all day brunch burger.  Did I say wow?  That burger was the most flavorful, juiciest burer I have had in a long long time.  The hashbrowns on it, with the fried egg....YUM!  It comes with ketchup...but no one in their right mind puts ketchup on a burger.  Gross. I had them put their special signature grill sauce on it.   Perfect. Even the French fries were really long, hot and crisy.

I and my friend both ordered their new southwestern salad. Big mistake. The presentation of the salad on the plate was the worst I have ever seen.  simple iceberg lettuce with some slight additions and the lettuce was wet and no dressing.  I would've told them to take that back to the kitchen but didn't want to embarrass my friend who's plate looked just like mine.  The chef must have been hallucinating by putting that out.  Really bad !,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phoenix-16?start=20

Food took way longer than should have to come out. Waited for server to pay she was no where to be found. Had to ask a server that was sitting up front on their phone where the host should have been to get our server still didn't come for a while and when they did they smelt of cigarettes and said they thought they showed us to pay on the device left on the table.

Which whatever I don't care about that but my friends boyfriend ordered a burger and asked for guacamole and when she brought our food out she said thy ran out of it. Later did we find out they don't even have guacamole on there menu. I ordered fish and chips it was horrendous. My friend ordered the beef and potatoes the beef looked like dog food not even close to what beef should look like.

There were only a few other guests there, mostly sitting at the bar. We were sat quickly and the waitress took our drink orders, she came back quickly to take our meal orders. My husband got the Standard Burger, the waitress asked him ""Pink or No Pink"" to which my husband responded ""No Pink"" and even followed up with ""Well Done"". Personally, I would think that meant he wanted the burger cooked all the way through. We got our food out and my husband cuts his burger in half... Low and behold the burger is pink throughout.  We call the waitress over to the table, show her the burger and remind her that he asked for well done. She responds with, ""it's only a little pink, but I can put it back on the grill."" My husband verifies that she plans on putting a but in half burger back on the grill, with all of the sauce and cheese already on it...  She then says, ""oh, you want a new one... Okay.""  Meanwhile, my brother and I have our food and are done eating. The manager brings his new burger out to us and explains that we will not be charged for the burger, we ask for it to go and the manager has an attitude about it and walks away while my husband is APOLOGIZING to him for the extra task! (If the food was cooked the correct way in the first place this would have been a non-issue) We then get the food to go and tip the waitress (for what I am not sure) and are walking out, all the while the manager is glaring at us from the bar.

It appeared that our waitress was covering half of the tables by herself while the other 4 waitresses we saw shared the other half. This on top of having more than 1 table that didn't speak english, making it harder for her to take the orders, could have been alleviated with a better distribution of waitresses. It took us far to long to be served (not our waitresses fault) than it should have. Finding out that there were things on the menu that were no longer being sold was kind of a bummer but not the end of the world. We ordered an appetizer and the kitchen forgot to make it. My wife's salad looked like it had been sitting out waiting to be served since the morning and was missing a few of the normal components. My meal was fine but seemed to have been tossed together compared to usual. It seems like service and quality have gone down hill very quickly at this location and it should be addressed immediately.

He came back about 2 minutes later with our drinks..we were not ready to order a yet (group of 6) so he said he would come back soon and check with us again..it took him 15 minutes to come back and take our order..lucky my kids were playing with the tablet they had on the table and lost track of time.. He came and took our order and to my surprise he didn't write down one thing anyone said .. He just kept saying ""yes sir"" ""ok"" so at that moment I was a little worried if he was going to get everyone's order in correctly. We waited another 30 minutes for an order of Spanish dip and mozzarella sticks..which he never brought us any plates for. 25 minutes later half of us received our main dish. My grandfather ordered baked potato and was given fries.. He let him keep them and went and got him a potato. He said the kids meals and my husbands chicken and shrimp were coming.. We ask for another round of drinks.. He said he would be right back.. Another women came out with my husbands meal but didn't know about the kids orders.. We waited another 20 minutes for my kids food and our drinks to come. Everybody else was almost done with their food..They had chicken tenders and fries and a cheese pizza and fries. Of course it took another 15 minutes to flag him down for our check.. 75$ check I only left a 8$ tip.. Trust me I didn't want to leave that. But I will say the food we received was good.. We all did enjoy our food...just wish we could of enjoyed it together. This experience was a real big disappointment for my family..

Came here on a Thursday night with my boyfriend. The place is considerably small, but we were seated immediately. I ordered the Thai Shrimp Salad and he got the appetizer trio or something like that with buffalo wings, mozzarella sticks and pretzel sticks w/ beer cheese. It came out in a reasonable amount of time. Being on their under 500 calories menu, I figures that the Thai shrimp salad was going to be sub-par, however it came out with 14 (I counted) well-seasoned, perfectly cooked and de-veined mini shrimp on top, which in my opinion is a really good deal for $10.99. The dressing was good, and was a nice mixture of spicy and sweet. I felt that they put a little too many pieces of shredded carrots and edamame pieces in it compared to the lettuce, but it wasn't a big deal. My only complaint would be that some of the lettuce wasn't as fresh as it could be and there were a couple of wilted pieces. Overall bill came out to be around $32 which is a tad high in my opinion for an Applebee's but whatever. I can't complain.  The service is plainly average.

The refills were not flowing and the waitress visits were few and far between. So with the ice, it was $2.35 for half of a glass of iced tea.

Came here last nght with a large party of friends and I was not pleased and that opinion was shared by everybody at my table. We were crammed in their largest booth... not a problem.   But it is a problem when someone has to leave for a minute and so you don't want to make everybody move again, so you come back and sit on the end right?   Waiter didn't like that and had the cojones to ask us to not move seats. I understand that it's inconvenient for the waiter as far as the check out goes, but I'm sorry, it's not about them.  If you're paying my bill, you can call the shots on where I sit in my booth.  But since you're not, we will figure out who gets what bill especially when all of us have our own separate checks anyway.  We know who got what and we'll help the waiter figure it out because we aren't total assholes... so don't ask us to not move seats when we aren't in chairs.

Another 10 minutes later she brought the rest of the salads, by which time the others at our table had finished their first rounds. We all had beverages (one cold tea, 2 waters, and 2 coffees) which would have free refills but we had to keep asking for refills instead of being offered. The waitress forgot the lemon that my sister-in-law had requested. The waitress once cleared 4 of our plates but went and served another table before clearing the last of ours ten minutes later. The Santa Fe chicken salad was described in the menu as coming with pico de gallo. My husband had two tiny chopped pieces of tomato in his, I had none. We were there for a total of 65 minutes, to be served nothing but pre-made soups and salads. Strangely, my sister-in-law was served a salad after everyone had said we were ready for the check. I don't think the waitress smiled once. I couldn't help but feel a bit sorry for her, though, as she looked nine months pregnant, and sick with the flu. The food was tasty and a good value, which is the only reason I'm giving more than one star. ALL FIVE OF US had EXPLOSIVE DIARRHEA within 5 minutes of finishing our food, even though two of us had ordered completely different soups/salad combinations. Absolutely the WORST experience we've ever had in an Applebee's anywhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phoenix-16?start=60
Sarah C.,"Chandler, AZ",4,38,,3.0,10/5/2009,"It was ""ok."" We got the two for $20 deal. The artichoke dip was good, but not great. The ribs were surprisingly good. We ordered two (SMALL) apple margaritas, and I was stunned upon getting the bill to find that they were almost nine dollars each! A bit ridiculous to me. Our waitress was really not engaging, but the service was prompt.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phoenix-16?start=80
Andrea T.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,18,,3.0,3/28/2011,"I would rate this particular applebees a 3 only because of the good service. If it was based on my food that was placed infront of me it would definatly be rated a 1. My boyfriend and I went out to eat here last Saturday night, we got a table immediatly and our server was right there to get our drink order. He was very fast and very good. However our food was horrible. We each ordered a steak (at about $15.00 a piece) - I ordered mine medium rare and my boyfriend ordered his medium. I honestly think that those steaks were on the grill for not even five full minutes. My boyfriends steak was so so so very much rarer then mine and mine was what can you say almost raw. no where near medium or medium rare. My boyfriends mashed potatoes were eehhhh flavorless i guess you could say, and as for out mixed/seasonal vegetables- well it was just a big stalk of broccolli. I didnt really even eat and we did not dare to send our steaks back although we definatly should have, however I have worked ina restaurant and I know you do not send your steak back to be recooked. Very disappointing experience. Will not go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phoenix-16?start=80
