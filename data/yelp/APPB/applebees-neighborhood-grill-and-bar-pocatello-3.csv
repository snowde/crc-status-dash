Alex U.,"American Falls, ID",5,101,8,4.0,10/5/2017,"Gotta give bees one more star they have few items on their menu I like to order most of  the time like steak with Parmesan and shrimp etc.And 80 % of the time they get my order correct.Not everybody knows in the kitchen how to steam veggies properly,which normally  should not be an issue.But by Poky standards the restaurant itself is very decent.  Another thing I like Applebee's have a parking spot for picking up food.Compared to other Applebee's locations I would say the one in Boise is better and more attentive to customer's needs, but then again Poky is Poky.I miss few items on their menu they got rid off. Once I needed to keep the receipt, which our waiter Autumn threw in a trash without asking me first and she had to dig it out from the garbage.  Other than that most of the time their Pocatello location is much better  than Texas Roadhouse in the same city and their hours are much more accomodating . Normal food place stays open longer on week ends.And to say he least there are not many dining options available after 10 pm in Pocatello.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pocatello-3
Patricia C.,"Pocatello, ID",83,62,122,4.0,11/7/2017,Great service tonight. The fish and chips was delectable. Thick white fish like ya don't see too much anymore. Quesadilla burger great as usual! My mother tried the tacos with bbq brisket and they looked good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pocatello-3
Lyle R.,"Pocatello, ID",220,66,12,2.0,6/10/2017,"Dear Applebee's, we used to be great friends. I would even go so far as saying lovers. We loved each other,  cared for each other, everything was going great. Now, I feel like we are an old couple growing apart more and more each time we get together. We try to make it work...but it's not me, it's you.  I still give the same if not more then in the past. Yes, your disappointing experience has got even more costly then before. With more cost comes less joy and less delicious food.  I hate to say this but we are over. Thanks for the memories..most of which are terrible with some good ones many years ago.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pocatello-3
Iris T.,"Chubbuck, ID",8,4,6,4.0,8/25/2016,"Applebee's is a good place to eat if you're traveling, since you receive a 10% discount if you're staying in a nearby hotel. The portions are very generous; if you're a person who can't eat much, one or two appetizers could be too much to finish.  I spend around 50 bucks for a party of two, but bigger eaters may spend more. Service is extremely fast for a sit-down restaurant, even around dinner time. I didn't spend much more than an hour and a half to two hours in total.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pocatello-3
Alec W.,"Dublin, CA",1,3,1,2.0,6/3/2016,"Oh Applebee's... Why must you always disappoint? I just returned from the most horrendous experience of my life. First of all, we sit down and the table is set up with this tablet, equipped with a menu of games. I go to play a game and it wants to charge me two dollars for something I could do for no cost on my iPhone. Ridiculous. For my meal, I ordered chicken tenders, apple juice, and a shake. There are two types of milkshakes on the menu, but they are drastically different. Decadent shakes and Shorty shakes are the two options, and there are no pictures or explanations for either. The shorty shakes are more expensive and have what I could only describe as ""more deluxe"" flavors. Naturally, I order one, assuming it is a step up from your everyday shake. After receiving it... I think not. This is completely bogus! My chocolate nut brownie shorty shake is practically the size of a shot glass, and it has a bite size brownie on top. How can one charge more for less??? This is highway robbery! I think that it must taste pretty delicious to be this small and also more expensive. It doesn't. In fact, it is eerily similar to a normal Applebee's Oreo shake, which is really not good either. They both taste like someone poured milk and cream in a cup with Oreos and blended it up. Very unfortunate. To complete this review, I will touch on the actual meal. The chicken tenders weren't awful but were indeed overly breaded.  But hey, at least the service was consistently great and speedy. Thanks waitresses, and screw you, shorty shakes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pocatello-3
Bryce M.,"Ammon, ID",105,20,2,1.0,2/6/2016,"I will never return to this Applebee's location. EVER. We came in with a large group last night, and the hostess, Shelby, was the absolute worst. She was so rude and disrespectful. Now, they were understandably busy, but Shelby treated us like garbage. As we walked in, she refused to seat us because we didn't have an exact number of people, although we told her we had 6-8 people. As we were still waiting on one or two people, we didn't have an exact number, and so she refused to place us on her list. Eventually, the last two people arrived and we told her the exact number. She then said, ""We're not putting people's names down because the kitchen is so backed up."" She told us the wait would be 25 minutes, which we were okay with. Just then, two other couples walked in behind us, and she happily greeted them and put their names down, but refused to write ours down. When we asked her if we could get placed on the list, she again told us that we couldn't be seated until the kitchen wasn't so backed up, even though they had plenty of open tables and were seating other couples. The way she handled the situation was just poor. We decided to leave 5 minutes later.  Sorry, Applebees, but if you continue to employ hostesses like Shelby, who refuse to pull the stick out of their ass, I'll be taking my business elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pocatello-3
Lucy M.,"Pocatello, ID",0,1,,1.0,11/20/2016,"It pains me to give this restaurant one star but it deserves zero after the service we received tonight. We arrived around 7:30. Ordered, everything was great until our drinks sat empty for 20 minutes. Our server never checked on us. A different server refilled our drinks.  Now onto the food: Our server walked by and asked how our food was but she never served us any food. 15 minutes later, i received my mozzarella sticks but my boyfriend received his burger about 10 minutes after my food. The mozzarella sticks were mediocre, but the All Day Brunch Burger was delicious. After I took a bite of my mozzarella sticks, they were so greasy that I needed a napkin, but were we're not given silverware or napkins. I, then, located some unused, wrapped up silverware.  Overall service:  Absolutely terrible. Our server was only present to close our table because that section of the restaurant was closing. The funny thing is, she decided to close our table while we we're waiting on our food. She reached across the table while I was eating my mozzarella sticks. Not exactly okay in my book.  We're really not harsh or hard to please but this was unlike any service we've ever received. We will not be returning. UPDATE: My boyfriends burger wasn't cooked all the way through.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pocatello-3
John C.,"Greenville, SC",26,352,10,3.0,5/13/2015,"Tonight I realized Applebee's on the whole is an epic fail as a culture, not individually by location.   I'm a huge Happy Hour Honk.  Offer me cheap beer and food and I'll consume until my stomach is a fire hazard.  You know, like my stomach is at maximum occupancy.  The happy hour at Applebee's might as well be non-existent.  $3.25 for domestic pints and 1/2 price on some apps is just alright based on food quality.   The food quality is generally above par.....except for today.  My hot buffalo wings were mild at best.  Decent taste but not what I asked for.  I also ordered an Oriental Chicken Wrap to go that actually tasted accurate and amazing.  1 out of 2 ain't bad I reckon.   The service today was spot on.  The server was very friendly and very attentive.  It's because of her this location gets a 3 out of 5.   I learned a very important lesson today....Don't go to Applebee's anymore.  You will be disappointed in some way or another.  Can't say I'll be back next time I'm in Pocatello but I can say for sure Applebee's is off my visit list.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pocatello-3

DJ M.,"Pocatello, ID",1,13,3,3.0,7/10/2016,"Usually I love Applebee's. But Sunday night has the second string chef, too much jalapeno, too much non melted gelatinous cheese! This an unusual thing here. Maybe the jalapeños were just a really good batch this time around. But even though I didn't make a big deal about it, our server noticed the tears and flushed face and took it off our bill anyway! Thank you Applebees, we'll always come back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pocatello-3
Billy W.,"Kailua, HI",49,10,5,5.0,9/15/2015,"They have just remodeled this place and it looks even better than before. They have iPads you can use to order and pay or play games while you wait. Or you can watch any of the huge HD TV's they have.  I love the fiesta lime chicken and get it almost every time I go. But I gotta say, the new burgers they have now are very good and tempt me to try one every time.

Charlene G.,"Calgary, Canada",0,17,4,1.0,3/9/2016,"My goodness,  what has applebees come down to.  Hubby ordered a steak cooked medium. It came a grey colour and completely raw.  I ordered the enchiladas and they were cold in the middle, rice was crispy, sour cream was hot.  Found out from the server it was cooked in the morning and reheated under the salamander. If I wanted a boiled steak and some reheated Mexican food I could have bought a frozen dinner from the grocery store.  Two thumbs down Applebees!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pocatello-3
Joe A.,"Meridian, ID",0,6,,5.0,2/17/2016,"Walked in thinking it was going to be typical chain food and rushed atmosphere. Being from Boise, that's what I expected. Totally wrong. First impression of the modern revamped bar area is very impressive. Then comes a friendly server named Jamie. She made me feel welcome. Ordered steak and potato and both were perfectly prepared. Patrick the manager is a friendly guy I must say. We talked about his Utah upbringing and how he needs to come visit beautiful Boise. Thumbs up Applebee's. What a pleasant surprise. I'll  be back when staying overnight in Pocatello.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pocatello-3
Chuck M.,"Silverdale, WA",2922,434,5224,4.0,11/23/2012,"I have eaten at Applebee's in various cities and the food has always been good. This night I had my tastebuds wanting the fish and chips only to find they were out of that. I settled for the fried shrimp, and it was good. There was more food on my plate than I could eat. I also had the chicken tortilla soup...good but a bit spicy.  I sat in the bar at one of the round tables and savored my cold beer. The waitress was very attentive, the food was good, no complaints....I will come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pocatello-3

Jim P.,"Pocatello, ID",36,4,9,2.0,10/23/2011,"I have eaten at the local Applebee's numerous times over the past several years that I have lived in Pocatello, and no matter how many chances I give them, I personally prefer not to waste my money in their establishment anymore. The reason being, is that I can PROMISE you that will have 1 of 3 experiences:  1st: You will have an excellent server, but your food/drink order will be completely wrong, messed up, very unsatisfactory, etc. 2nd: Your server will be very unsatisfactory, and in fact, at times horrible, but your food/drink order will be satisfactory or decent. 3rd: Your server will be very unsatisfactory or horrible, AND your food/drink order will be completely wrong, messed up, very unsatisfactory, etc.  My advice is to take your business elsewhere. This is a constant thing that never changes with them and is EXTREMELY bad for business. Otherwise, dine at your own risk...

Jill J.,"West Jordan, UT",0,4,,1.0,8/24/2014,"The ONLY reason this review is getting even one star is that the Asst. mgr came to our table twice to apologize and comped our son a dessert. - service was so slow - our server forgot to put in our appetizer order. - our drinks were not refilled - they ""forgot"" to bring out my sons meal.  After I asked that they please take it off the ticket they ""remembered it"" and brought it out - the side dishes for my kids meal were not right.  The table behind us and the table to the side of us had dirty dishes on the tables that were not cleared the whole hour we were there.   Awful, awful, awful.  We will not be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pocatello-3?start=20
Jaylinne S.,"Pocatello, ID",0,8,,3.0,8/17/2014,"I normally Love Applebee's, my family use to go there about once a week after work. After my last experience though they can't plan on me being in for a long time. Me and my sister came in for lunch and after we were seated and given our menus. We then sat for about 10 minutes deciding our food. We then waited 10 more minutes with no waiter, even though numerous times we would see employees pass setting table or taking a hokey to the floor. They even helped every table around us. After about 25 minutes of sitting around we got up and left. No employee even spared us a second glance. Word of advice, if you go to Applebees go at night.
