Jeremy M.,"Fort Gratiot Township, MI",107,42,2,5.0,9/9/2017,Went here for dinner last night with my mom. The Artichoke Dip at Applebee's is very tasty. Had the Grilled Chicken Breast with the Bacon Beer Cheese Topper with Steamed Broccoli and the Fire Grilled Veggies. The beer cheese on the chicken breast tasted really good. The service at this location is very consistent and the prices are very reasonable for anyone that is on a budget especially the 2 for $20. Would come here again in the future.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-port-huron
Aysha F.,"Fort Gratiot Township, MI",13,9,13,3.0,4/3/2017,Saturday lunch. Pretty happening place. Place was good  food was great  we ordered the blazin Texas burger with onion rings. French onion soup and Thai shrimp salad. All good but yeah pricy. The FOS quantity was way less than what I got in raven coffee house but the same price. Visit this place when u don't see anything much happening around. Will be interesting. I'm not giving five stars for the less quantity of food and higher price.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-port-huron

Octavia Daenerys E.,"Tewksbury, MA",25,107,43,4.0,5/21/2016,"Ate here many times, love the won ton taco appetizers! It's a chain restaurant which isn't my favorite but the food is still decent, the drinks are delicious though vastly over priced and the service is good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-port-huron
T.J. G.,"Port Huron, MI",221,142,640,4.0,9/26/2015,"I have only one other issue - and it's more with the chain than this specific location. Applebee's has a very, IMHO, perplexing habit of repeatedly changing its menu - sometimes several times a year - and eliminating some of their dishes just as they are getting a following. While I'm all for variety, it seems like I just begin to enjoy a dish when the remove it from the menu. Just a few examples: I loved their veggie patch pizza, the various varieties of the fajita roll up, and the fajitas themselves. All have been eliminated, with only one variation of the fajita roll up has returned (chicken). I'm sure this is a corporate decision - but it is a very confusing one for the consumer, and one that means this particular patron doesn't eat here as much as he once did.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-port-huron
Jason G.,"Port Huron, MI",10,34,35,4.0,5/5/2016,"Relatively fast service considering to day was Cinco de Mayo. Delicious nachos and quesadillas. The food here on other days has always been good, but sometimes tasteless. Service also had not been kind. One time our waitress forgot we were there and we had to wait thirty minutes for the appetizer. Other than that experience, everything has been average.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-port-huron
Eli G.,"Sterling Heights, MI",0,4,1,5.0,9/2/2016,Was a great food And the waiter was nice as well;) I probably gonna come back for that happy hour:),https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-port-huron
Stephanie B.,"New Baltimore, MI",56,299,324,3.0,11/18/2014,Honestly this is probably one of the best Applebee's I have been to. Waitress made sure my friend and I had refills and enough napkins. Place was really busy for a Friday night but we were able to get a nice booth before the late dinner rush hit. Bar manager even walked around making sure everyone was taken care of. Prices are a little steep though. The Spinach and Artichoke hoovers around $9 and the portion is pretty tiny. We ran out of chips and still had dip left. The waitress told us if we wanted more chips we would have to buy another Spinach and Artichoke dip. We'll be back again but next time we'll just be cautious of what we order.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-port-huron
Joe H.,"Port Huron, MI",0,6,,5.0,8/18/2016,This is our goto on date night. The food is top notch as well as the service. Drinks are always perfect and the prices are excellent. Portions are just right. We always have a positive experience while dining at the Port Huron Applebee's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-port-huron
Heather M.,"Mount Clemens, MI",21,13,,2.0,6/6/2016,They make good lemonades and drinks..but every time I go there they overcook the meats everytime. Which is why i only order the fajita rollup and i did try the wonton tacos which were good too. But my sister in law ordered medium rare steak recently and got it well done which is what I sadly predicted. Now if you send it back they are usually good about correcting the problem or maybe offering another option... But you get tired of having  to do that since u either have to wait and watch your friend or SO eat or you don't eat at all.  I have had a chicken dish...dry and overcooked..had their steak dishes overcooked again..so just steer clear of their chicken and steaks and you'll be fine. They make really good mac n cheese and wings are decent too. Even this last visit they stuffed the rollup with so many onions so my husband said he would never order it again. Applebees is not what it used to be years ago..I will usually just keep to local restaurants knowing they have to actually try cooking their food right.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-port-huron
Heather T.,"Downtown Detroit, Detroit, MI",3,13,14,4.0,10/10/2015,Standard fare...yummy sandwiches & drinks! Waitress forgot out waters but the manager came by & helped us out.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-port-huron
Travis F.,"Port Huron, MI",29,72,,2.0,6/18/2015,"Overpriced mediocrity pummeled into your brain by a relentless advertising campaign. There's nothing special about it. I've never had a dish at any Applebee's that left me thinking, ""I should go back again just to have that."" If you do, then I suggest you learn how to cook... or take the time to examine other restaurants. They're not awful like they're not worth exploring.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-port-huron
Kim K.,"Port Huron, MI",15,1,,5.0,7/9/2015,Tina Marie is fabulous! Wings are great! Happy hour appetizers are a great deal! The new maple chicken padini was very good as well.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-port-huron
Scott S.,"Smiths Creek, MI",0,3,,4.0,8/28/2015,Food it always yummy. I like the dteak oin the 2 for 20 deal. Wife and i came fo a early dinner and extra lemon is no extra charge,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-port-huron
Keshiaann E.,"Port Huron, MI",27,3,,4.0,7/18/2015,"As far as the food goes, I've always had good food here. The one thing I noticed lately are the portion sizes have gotten smaller. With that being said, it is 2 for 20 so it's not a gourmet meal. It's way better then a fast food place and reasonably-priced. The service could use some improvement, especially the hostess who are not that friendly or welcoming.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-port-huron
Michaela S.,"St Thomas, Canada",0,23,,2.0,12/31/2012,"This was our 3rd visit to Applebee's in Port Huron in the past year.  The food is getting worse, and this time our server (Michael N.) just took the cake.  We were 5 people coming in for Lunch and he just did his best to ignore us, while socializing with the other servers. 2 of us had the SOUTHWEST SHRIMP FETTUCCINE and it had a good amount of shrimp on it, but was very greasy.   BOURBON STREET CHICKEN & SHRIMP was great. THREE-CHEESE CHICKEN PENNE was very greasy as well, and the  HAND-BATTERED FISH & CHIPS were okay. The food arrived fast, even though the restaurant was crowded. Considering what we paid for our food, we will look for friendlier alternatives next time we visit Port Huron.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-port-huron
Adam S.,"Fort Gratiot Township, MI",12,144,54,2.0,4/13/2013,"Food is okay. I did not like the service the one time I ate on Memorial Day Weekend. My group of people and I waited 40 minutes for our food to arrive, and then have to eat cold food. Things are going downhill for this restaurant. If they can't get their management in gear, then this will be another Blue Water business casualty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-port-huron
Daroki K.,"Austin, TX",15,139,33,3.0,11/19/2011,"Alright I have to temper this a bit, after being around the block a bit more and reviewing some other schlubs. This place is what i said it is,  BUT its better than several alternatives (Chilis for example), they have some decent drink specials, and if you go there later at night during the week the food is cheaper. So there are some things to entice you. I would think most Americans have eaten at one of these joints by now; if not, remember Applebees before Chilis, but if you want a real neighborhood place go downtown.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-port-huron
Rhiannon E.,"Port Huron, MI",0,1,,4.0,7/31/2014,Applebees is a good place to eat at and the service is great. And people need to stop complaining about a limited selection of vegetarian food. This is not a vegetarian restaurant so get over it. If you dont like it dont eat here. How hard is that?!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-port-huron
Jordie B.,"Port Huron, MI",0,1,,1.0,12/22/2012,"I always thought this applebees was alright but the last couple times i have been there the food has been awful, after i received cold food tonight i thought id write my first ever restaurant review.
