John S.,"Queensbury, NY",0,4,,3.0,1/10/2018,There was a long hair in my salad!   While it was comped it didn't make up for the shock.  A first time for everything.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-queensbury-3
Nichole L.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,52,27,5.0,10/10/2017,"I have been to a lot of Applebee's however this is the best one I have been to.  The service was excellent.  Food was fresh, hot and very good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-queensbury-3
Hannah A.,"Glens Falls, NY",14,2,,1.0,12/17/2017,If I could I'd give this place no stars. I used to love Applebee's until it gave me and my dad severe food poisoning and had to go to the ER because of how bad I felt. Never eating here again. Never has a places food gotten me this sick before I felt like I was going to die. Do not recommend.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-queensbury-3
Jim F.,"Queensbury, NY",5,12,,2.0,2/17/2017,Service was poor slow looks like the have new bartenders who can not figure out beer yet Slow taking orders food came out okay for a typical Applebee. The place was too dark to read the menu i dont know what p . They are attempting. Stick with basics dont confuse them,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-queensbury-3
Rafael F.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,19,,4.0,7/16/2017,One of the best Applebees I have ever been to. The staff was super courteous and accommodating. The food was exactly what we expected. The bathrooms were a little under-kept - bumping down the grade a bit.   But overall a wonderful experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-queensbury-3
Gary B.,"Queensbury, NY",60,66,9,3.0,4/30/2016,"There's only a few things on the menu I really like, and even then, consistency can really affect my experience.   I really enjoy the riblets, so that's practically the only thing I get.  The wings are very good too most nights.  There's a few other apps I like, so sometimes we will sample a few.  They have a few servers who are quite good, but some others, not so much.  It's one of the few places in town that I really find myself craving a visit to, but enough average to below average visits keeps us only going there every so often.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-queensbury-3
Brooke M.,"Vernon, CT",0,20,,1.0,10/22/2017,"Have found this Applebee's has certainly gone down in the service and food quality departments. Last night was particularly bad. Went to Applebee's because it didn't look busy (we had just tried to get into Texas Roadhouse, but the wait was too long) so this was our second choice. Got right in and seated, ordered food and drinks at the same time with no issues. 20 minutes pass and we haven't even got our drinks yet. The waitress comes over and asks how everything is! We were like well we haven't got our drinks, she said oh! I will go get those. Went and grabbed those, which took 10 minutes, brought them back and we asked how our food was doing because at this point it had been about a half hour AND THEN she goes on to say ""Did they not tell you it was going to be a 40-50 minute wait for all food?"" Ummm no, they did not. So we asked if we could at least get our appetizer and she brought that out and said it would be about 20 minutes for our food. Meanwhile we could see people that had been seated after us get their food almost immediately after ordering. Finally the food comes out 25 minutes later and is not good at all. Very cold, undercooked chicken, and overcooked steak. Had to ask multiple times for some barbecue sauce for the food that was edible. At that point the only reason we had stayed to eat was because we were all exhausted from traveling and it was getting to be almost 9:30 and none of us had eaten since lunch. Then she comes back over and says the manager will be with us shortly to talk about our bill. So we wait, and this guy walks by us only to stop and ask how we are doing - didn't introduce himself as the manager and just kept walking. She comes back and asks if the manager handled everything for us and we told her we didn't know the guy was the manager because he just kept walking. So she went back AGAIN to talk to him and finally brought us the check, which they took half off of for all the issues we had. Meanwhile the hostess at the front still wasn't telling people the wait time, and neither were any of the waitresses that we could hear. I think they need to reevaluate their communication skills between the hostess, waitresses, and manager because they were clearly lacking last night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-queensbury-3
Cody J.,"Fort Ann, NY",58,10,6,1.0,11/2/2016,"After several more times back it just keeps getting worse.  Have had 2 carside orders that when I come to get them, they state they never received but the app shows they were complete, which leaves me to believe the gave them to somebody else.  Staff seem like they don't care to be working and have better things to do.  Last visit inside we saw our waitress once when we sat down and then never again.  Different one brought our food then we had to ask another to refill our drinks. After waiting 20 mins after finishing our meal we went to bar to close out our check as she never returned with it.  I need of a serious overhaul!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-queensbury-3
Joshua F.,"Whitehall, NY",20,2,,1.0,6/23/2017,The service and food are usually really good but this experience is the total opposite first it took 15 minutes to even get our drinks then another 10 for our appetizer that was gross then finally got our food that is also gross,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-queensbury-3
Bethany S.,"Cambridge, NY",0,1,,2.0,10/1/2016,"As a child I always had a dislike for Applebee's, so I haven't gone to one in 5 to 7 years. I decided to give it another chance but overall was pretty disappointed. Service was good and had friendly people but the food really wasn't up to standards. I got the 4 cheese Mac and cheese with chicken and unfortunately it wasn't what I expected. The presentation was pretty okay overall but the eating experience wasn't. The chicken was on top of the Mac and had a sauce on it which ended up getting into the pasta and giving it an odd flavor and slimy texture. The chicken tasted just fine but in the end I was unable to finish the pasta without feeling uncomfortable. My brother had the Triple Hog Dare Ya and thought it was meh overall with the ""signature sauce"" being overwhelming. Not the worst food I've had but certainly not the best.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-queensbury-3
Casey M.,"Quincy, MA",75,4,1,1.0,3/18/2017,"The bartender at this location is extremely rude and terrible at making drinks. It always takes forever to get them, they are rarely correct, and she consistently has an attitude. I have never had an issue with any of the staff at this Applebees. Service has always been decent to good. But this female bartender makes any experience that involves drinks painful. My dad ordered a bud light and hadn't gotten it after waiting for 20 minutes so I kindly asked about it. Two seconds later the waitress also asked the bartender about it and the bartender flipped out and started yelling about how she was doing a to-go order and we could relax. She came over huffing and puffing, put the beer on the table and said ""I was busy pouring 3 bud lights before yours."" Funny thing is, she was chatting away at the bar with a guy - not pouring drinks. I'm sure she gets a tip from him so she is more likely to give customers at the bar faster service but I've had way too many negative experiences with her at this point for that to be an excuse. I don't know how she still has a job here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-queensbury-3
Anthony G.,"Glens Falls, NY",1,40,2,1.0,7/13/2015,"Oh where to start?  I'm not certain which was more dull and mundane: the service or the food and beverage.  The waitress was bored and uninterested.  It appeared that she may have been on Lithium, but without the weight gain and dry mouth.   So the on tap choices were equally boring. A variety of domestic swill with the most excitement coming from Blue Moon, or Sam's seasonal.  Call me a beer snob, but I wasn't excited.  I was offered the beer on special which was Corona Lite.  Why not?   Well, for around $6.50 and room temperature, it sure is special! On to the flavorless entrees.   Our junior in our threesome, read ten books and scored himself a free corn dog with cold, stale fries, and a juice box!  Boy was he excited! My brother and I thought we'd try the 2 for $20.  I, being a bit more hungry upgraded to the larger steak for $3 more.   So the only way to get flavor out of my steak was to add A1 and so much salt and pepper that I was forced to order another room temperature Corona.  I thought I was in Germany for a moment. My brother ordered some chicken fiesta treat.  Flavorless and room temp.  So, in closing, I've had better experiences in the hospital cafeteria at 3:30am before closing time.  Never to spoil good company, we vowed never to return even with the allure of a free corn dog.  Although I may sound like a pompous fool, the waitress did get 20%.  And I must add the gentleman who delivered the A1 was friendly and attentive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-queensbury-3
Laura B.,"Queensbury, NY",4,2,,4.0,11/12/2014,"My kids & husband surprised me yesterday and took me out to lunch to Applebee's . It's was extremely busy,  service was excellent , food was hot and fresh. My kids love the 2 for $ 20 !!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-queensbury-3
B T.,"Glens Falls, NY",2,69,,3.0,9/17/2015,"It's a chain so nothing amazing or awful. Their service is typically pretty good, at the bar and tables. Friendly and usually pretty efficient. Not a fan of their onion rings or boneless wings... the breading is too hard and overbearing. Less is more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-queensbury-3
Zack G.,"Hilton Head Island, SC",16,3,4,1.0,4/13/2014,TERRIBLE! Waitress gave me the wrong drink. Burger came out overcooked and fries were cold. And. Came during half off appetizers.  And then they charge just full price. Over all don't go to this Applebee's,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-queensbury-3
Jim M.,"Glens Falls, NY",40,25,,1.0,2/27/2015,Ordered a fiesta salad. Half the size of my wife's half size oriental salad .. Wouldn't have filled a side salad bowl. Manager argued it made perfect sense my full sized salad was half the size of my wife's half salad because it was chopped. Salad literally cost $2 an ounce.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-queensbury-3
Amanda D.,"Hudson Falls, NY",7,25,,5.0,9/13/2014,Good food. Have been going here for years. Have had a few minor problems but they are always good about fixing it and going beyond. Happy hour is a great deal.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-queensbury-3
Tammy W.,"Glens Falls, NY",0,1,,1.0,11/3/2014,Ordered to go. Staff was rude. Food was terrible. Hot foods put in same bag with a dessert topped with ice cream. Hostesses were polite.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-queensbury-3
Douglas S.,"Altamont, NY",0,4,5,3.0,11/10/2012,About as good as a chain of this sort of restaurant can be. The waitress was friendly and attentive. The hostess appeared annoyed when she suggested I sit at the bar and I requested a booth instead.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-queensbury-3
Jeffrey V.,"Queensbury, NY",0,46,4,1.0,5/11/2014,"We have been to this Applebees 6 times and have found that its usually hit or miss, more often its miss.  Either the service is lacking, or the food is terrible, sometimes both.  In the past we have enjoyed other Applebee's restaurants and had high hopes for this one as its right near where we reside.  But sadly the last 2 times the food was awful, the spinach dip appertizer was terrible.  It tasted like someone had left it out on the counter for a day or 2 and the chips were actually soggy. My wifes salad contained wilted and mushy vegetables, and my boneless Buffalo wings were cold and hard probably overcooked. Honestly the food felt as if it were just old. The service seem to be going downhill there as well, we barely saw our waitress, which was odd since the place was sparsly crowded, and she seemed to not been to enthusiastic about her job.  I have gotten the same feedback from friends who have gone there as well.  I realize that everyone has an off day, and we gave them a few chances, but for my money I'd rather go somewhere that I know will give me what I pay for, not a bellyache.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-queensbury-3
