Olivia T.,"Boston, MA",1,1,,5.0,10/5/2017,"Applebees... the dollar margarita one stop shop.  After a very busy night and one bartender quit during this shift in front of the entire bar, we met Lindsey. An awesome bartender/ server who really stepped up her game in the busiest month of the year. She was kind, honest and had a wonderful attitude throughout the the entire night. We really appreciated her service.  Also a nod to Kristen the other bartender who really put in the work to keep the service bar afloat. Thank you. We had a great time.  Barbera, You were wonderful. With the stress of three teams playing in one night and the short staff that you had, we commend you for your leadership and hospitality.  All in all, we as guests understand the industry and how challenging it can be. Thank you for a wonderful night!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-quincy-5
Einar H.,"Quincy, MA",3,31,4,1.0,9/14/2017,"My wife and I stopped in on a Saturday night around 6PM. We were seat in less then two minutes. Then we sat there for almost 20 minutes just starring at the menus. And no wait staff even came by at all to find out if we wanted anything to drink! Then another couple were seated right behind us. The waitress came right up to them took there drink orders and got them for them while we sat there with nothing at all!  So I said to my wife. We are out of here! Then on our way out the door the hostess asked if we enjoyed everything! And I said not here! Applebee's is now on our ""C"" list as in SEE YOU NEVER AGAIN!!!    This chain of places has never impressed me at all. I was a Chef for almost 30 years and I never have seen service this bad!!  Like I tell everyone when you find a good restaurant you tell your friends and family. And when find a bad restaurant you tell everybody!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-quincy-5
Jess M.,"Cambridge, MA",43,257,31,2.0,8/13/2017,"Service was great, but everything else was mostly disappointing. I got steak, green beans, ""shrimp topper,"" and mashed potatoes. We also got spinach and artichoke dip. Our dip was super late and the waitress told us that it was given to the wrong table. She handled it super well and got us chips and salsa and brought the dip out later plus didn't charge us for either. Salsa was really good, spinach and artichoke dip was okay. Most of my entree was cold, except for the mashed potatoes (which are fantastic!) I ordered my steak medium and got it very very well done. Inedible. I said something and our waitress offered to get me something else but since I already ate everything else and was full I asked for a chicken breast to go. She ended up throwing in sides to make it a full entree, so that was super thoughtful. Yeah and the ladies room was very very gross and I stepped in pee. Yum. Summary- go somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-quincy-5
Young P.,"Boston, MA",224,346,388,3.0,9/22/2017,"Your average Applebee's. Nothing fancy, just average in terms of food, service, and just overall experience. Monday - Burger Night ($6.99) Wed - Steak Dinner Night ($10.99)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-quincy-5
Anhthu M.,"Dorchester, MA",0,20,33,5.0,7/25/2017,"We come to this Applebee's location quite often, about twice a month on average. The food has been consistent although the service can be a hit or miss if you get any of the new waitresses (more often miss). However, Angela, the bartender is a gem. She is friendly, fun and quick and she knows us.  The bacon wedged iceberg lettuce, spinach artichoke dip, boned in chicken wings, and molten chocolate lava cake with ice cream are always among our top choices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-quincy-5

Dominique N.,"Rockland, MA",0,3,,1.0,10/3/2017,"My friends and I just went to this location because we saw that it was $1 margaritas for the month of October. We went to the bar and said ""three $1 margaritas"" the bartender replied ""okay 3 perfect margaritas"" and served us. She neglected to tell us that the perfect margaritas weren't $1 they were $9.50 each. Completely mislead us. Do not go here.

Jessica T.,"Norwell, MA",0,14,6,2.0,7/18/2017,"When people say, ""they don't make em' like they used to,"" I'm sure they are referring to Applebee's. We only came here for their old chicken finger baskets and they are now hard, crispy chicken crusts. Slow service, bizarre mix of food, and poor quality just about sums it up. The mozzarella sticks were basically cheese sticks rolled in salt, the steak was salty and soggy (not sure what that was about), and I was very confused by the gourmet/pub style plates. I almost died of dehydration on the drive home. On the bright side, you can pay the bill at the table with the least possible tip and run away within 3 minutes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-quincy-5
Kimberly A.,"Boston, MA",325,376,,5.0,1/18/2017,I usually come here later at night because I often work the late shift at work and this is one of the few places in the area that are actually open by the time I get off. The menu is pretty good sized and there's always something for everyone on it. The service is always quick and the waitstaff is very friendly. The food is very good for a chain restaurant. They offer select appetizers at half price after 9 PM so sometimes I will opt for some appetizers as a meal. Their mozzarella sticks are a good choice and the marinara sauce that comes with them is tasty. If you want dessert but don't have room for anything big they do offer brownie bites which are a mini version of a brownie sundae and it hits the spot. This is a nice family restaurant so if you are wanting to get out with family and are looking for a place to go this is a very good option.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-quincy-5
Deige A.,"Brockton, MA",28,124,380,2.0,7/29/2016,"Customer service itself was good but let's get to the food. Now usually when you see a lot of menu items, it's a good indicator that some of the food is frozen and simply reheated. That's fine, it's a chain restaurant what do you really expect?. I had the ordered the new menu item: Mac and cheese. This was honestly terrible, tastes straight frozen; you could taste that ice melt. My steak? Absolutely no flavor or juice even with it beginning cooked medium well. This is my third time all together trying Applebee's as a chain and probably my last time",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-quincy-5

Baldemar R.,"Beverly Hills, CA",102,151,127,4.0,5/18/2017,Came here for the first time ever..wow what a deal 2 for 20..salad was great and I got a chicken pasta dish that was also great..it's currently 93 outside and this location has great AC..will come back,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-quincy-5
Ashley A.,"Allston, MA",191,169,404,4.0,3/26/2016,"Bar food is predictable, maybe on the smaller side but for the price it's reasonable. I got the combo: a combination of honey pepper chicken fingers with onion soup and fries. Since it's the first time I had the soup, I was not crazy about the look of the bread, but if you make it through that layer the soup is ok. The sauce on the wings is definitely particular, if you have a sweet tooth and like fried chicken then this is the dish for you. The best part was the Perfect Margarita in strawberry flavor. Strong, and for two drinks I would say the $9 is definitely on the extremely cheap. I may go again just for the Perfect Margarita -and I don't even like regular margaritas like that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-quincy-5
Robert V.,"Hingham, MA",9,60,,5.0,8/7/2017,Ive ate some meals here and I must say the new menu is a big improvement.  The staff is very nice.  The chicken dish I had was packed with flavor and the wood fired grill is a nice change.  The beer is ice cold and delicious.  They have about 10 taps which is adequete.  They make a good cocktail.  I see a lot of negative reviews and I can see why.  Despite the improvements some of the customers are not the best.  In applebees defense these customers giving two star ratings wouldnt know good food if it hit them in the ass.  There idiots and people should know applebees is on the comeback trail.  I give it two thumbs up,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-quincy-5
Jeanie T.,"Quincy, MA",43,34,12,3.0,10/27/2015,"Applebees definitely got better after their renovation a few years ago. My girlfriends and I only come here because it's close by with a parking lot. They also sell pitchers of sangria for cheap. The only down side is that it's so watered down it just tastes like juice after. Applebees like to fill their pitcher up with ice first then add wine which is probably why it's only $15 dollars for it. As if that's not enough, they add ice to your glass as well.   Food is mediocre and nothing special but for a quick cheap meal during girl talk, I really don't mind it. I also didn't mind that time when the cops were called because a guy was doing crack on the men's toilet. That's the most exciting thing that's happened to me on a Friday night for a while.  Before you leave, remember to order a dessert! They have a pretty good selection and it's soooo good! Even if you're too full to have dessert, they offer brownie bites for $1.29 and it comes with a small scoop of ice cream. Trust me, you won't regret it. Oh yeah, they also have a new kiosk on each table where you can split the bill evenly with your group and pay with your credit card without having to wait for your server to hand you the bill during busy hours. So convenient. Oh, technology these days......",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-quincy-5

Jonathan B.,"Weymouth, MA",1,20,,1.0,11/13/2016,"I've been here a few times and the food was horrible on every visit.  On the last visit the food, my usual for coming here on Veteran's Day,  All American Bacon cheeseburger with fries,  gave me diarrhea from hell.  I ordered the burger well done and it was no where near well cooked.  It was very greasy, and it didn't get served by the waitress, but the cook, which I thought was strange.   You would think on Veteran's day the food would be better than usual, but it was the opposite.  I guess you really do get what you pay for, here anyway.    So in conclusion, three strikes and you're out.   I will never dine here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-quincy-5
Jill M.,"Quincy, MA",0,3,,4.0,9/1/2017,"I eat here a lot with my family. The key is to understand that this is a chain family restaurant and that you should not explect a gourmet dining experience.

Wendy H.,"Braintree, MA",0,12,,1.0,10/27/2017,"Not my idea to come here so here is the review. We got seated right away and it took about a long 5 minute for a waitress to come take our order. Came here with two other people so we got an order of boneless buffalo chicken and three entrees. I went to the bathroom  after putting our orders in and I see our waitress texting on her phone. A different waitress brought out our boneless chicken appetizer. The celery sticks had dirt on it. No one brought us plates to share the appetizer. Then two of our entree came and guess what? A different waitress brought it out. Then I saw our waitress came out of the bathroom. To remind you, it takes awhile out food to be cooked and that was how long she has been in there on her phone. She came over to our table and ask if all the food came and we told her one entree is missing. She went to check and said someone gave our entree to another table. Of course because you were in the bathroom for 15+ minutes. All in all, worst customer service ever, food is nasty, and this place smells awful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-quincy-5
Bill W.,"Quincy, MA",0,2,,1.0,6/16/2017,"If I could give zero stars, I would. I just left there at 9pm, June 16, 2017, and have to say you have the absolute rudest barmaid I've ever encountered. When she's not gossiping with the locals, she's bad-mouthing her fellow employees. I'm sure no one at this establishment cares enough to address me or her about her rotten attitude and general laziness. I never rate restaurants. I either like the food or I don't. If I don't, I just don't go back. I liked my burger, but given the hostile environment your barmaid wants to create in this particular restaurant, I will never return.

Clifford J.,"Manhattan, NY",296,37,42,3.0,8/10/2015,I have been to many Applebee's in my time on earth and this is just like the rest. There wasn't anything that stood out to me other than the new menus!  I think the only thing that stood out to me as better than the others was the waitress that I had serving me. She was cracking jokes and making me feel welcome. I came in an hour until closing so I was unsure about the response I'd have from the staff but it was definitely pleasant.  This Applebee's has half-priced appetizers (select kinds) after 9:00pm (if you order a beverage). We came for the apps! I ordered mozzarella sticks and boneless buffalo wings and a margarita and my check came to less than 20 dollars. The apps were less than $10 total! It is a great deal if you don't want to spend too much money on a full dinner at another restaurant. I loved my experience here and would definitely come back again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-quincy-5?start=20

She ended up making the mash for me, but I got home I ended up with diarrhea.

She was attentive about getting me what I wanted even when my first and second choices weren't available. She made sure to get EVERYTHING we ordered in complementary order so we really enjoyed our meal. It was quiet so noise level was none and her section was small and the party she had left and even with that she tried to make sure we were ALWAYS comfortable. Plus the management was gracious from door to floor and helped clean and do what was necessary. I used to be a waitress so yes these are things I look for but nonetheless expect as a regular paying guest and treating my server with the same respect I want to get.

Brooke W.,"Boulder, CO",2,34,10,2.0,8/8/2012,"I've been to this Apple Bees many a time for drinks... although the sangria is pretty weak it is delicious. The food is not appetizing. What is more I found a piece of plastic in my burnt fiesta lime chicken yesterday. This is one of their signature meals labeled with ""'you'll be back' taste"".... supposedly. The rice was dry, the pico de gallo was more like chopped unripened tomatos. I hate to say it but the tortilla strips were the best part of the meal! Also my friend who is vegetarian was with me and brought to my attention that there aren't any legitimate/hearty vegetarian options, even the salads are topped with meat. EDIT: Despite my unhappy review above, a friend of mine holds a special place in her heart for Applebees and got me to tag along for dinner recently. She and I both got an Asian crispy chicken salad.

They were very attentive to our concerns and courtesy to their customers. That will be our only reason to go back. Not too familiar with Applebee's menu(his mom gave him a certificate), we'll give it a try since its been sitting in his wallet. The food: appetiter sampler came with an array of faves...chix tender (wish we chose some other flavor besides bbq honey), mozzarella stix, Spinach dips, quesadilla...all not bad. We got the 20 for 2 meal deal. I got the 7oz steak (was craving for Steaktips for weeks, but didn't see it on the menu.) Medium rare came out well done.However, the mashed potato and steam veggies were good. The waitress gladly exchanged the steak to my liking. My guy's meal was the chicken penne, which he ate some of the pasta,which he liked, but then we noticed the translucent  redness on the sliced chicken strips. Yes, they were sliced! Didn't the cook or the sous chef paid any attention to the quality control of their cooking? The lady manager came by (I noticed she's been greeting and checking every table...Applebee's need to take notice, she deserves a bonus for her customer care!). She was so courtesy and concerned that she kindly exchanged a new one. We addressed our problems so the establishment can improve, that's what they need for their kitchen. We packed both meals to go since we both were full from the appetizer and Caesar salads.  When the bill came, they took off a portion of the bill, which was very nice of her.

Caroline F.,"Somerville, MA",2,8,1,1.0,7/4/2012,"The food, cleanliness, and service during the meal was okay. And yes - the amount of salt and butter doused on every item of food is enough to season an entire family of four's meal. But all this mediocrity I expected. What REALLY annoyed me however is the fact that the waiter (Matt) did not give us our change back for the bill and just ASSUMED that the remainder was his tip. He did not consult with us whether we wanted the change back, which is standard practice! Usually, the waiter usually just gives back the change and the guest then leaves a tip, unless the guest requests no change is necessary.

Joe B.,"Quincy, MA",16,26,,2.0,3/5/2013,"Even after reading a few reviews on here and other places we decided to give it a go.  Fail sauce.  The first impression pretty much set me off.  We walked in to an empty reception area and waited.  And waited.  My partner went to the restroom, I stood at the hostess stand and downloaded a few games onto my new phone..   Worth noting, the manager was in my eye sight having a personal conversation with someone not in uniform (I assume a friend) and I made eye contact with the bartender and a waiter 4 tables from the door...  And we waited....  After 7 minutes, I walked into the bar and waited.  And waited.  Finally after a full 10 minutes in the doors, we were acknowledged by an employee.  We were seated at a somewhat clean table and given menus.   Our server arrived, offered the mandated margarita (if they don't offer one, you get a free appetizer).  We placed our drink and app order.  Drinks came and we ordered food..  So far so good.  Our appetizer arrived and so began the decent of the meal.  We ordered the pretzels with craft beer cheese sauce.  This is an appetizer that T.G.I. Fridays made popular last year and since then, it's popped up on chain restaurant menus everywhere.  Once you've had the pretzels at Fridays, don't try them anywhere else.  They set the bar way too high.  Every other place I've tried them has missed the mark on the recipe... Think ""new coke"" vs ""classic coke"".   Anyways, the pretzel part was decent,  the vat of congealed cheese sauce on the other hand left much to be desired.  A little parsley or scallion or anything not urine yellow colored  would have gone a long way towards making it not look like a vat of mucus.   The food arrived in decent time.  Contrary to other reviews, other than our initial greeting, the timing of everything was going well for us.... At that point.... My ""Cajun Steak"" was insanely over cooked.  I ordered medium, it was pushing well.  There was also no discernible Cajun flavor on the plate.   I was going to ask for some Cajun seasoning but little did I know, we wouldn't see our waitress again for quite some time.   Once I'd eaten my potatoes and shrimp (oddly enough, the shrimp were cooked perfect, something I never expect from chain joints) I decide to eat my steak in its current form in hopes that even though the flavor was off, my body could still gain some nutrition from the animal.    My meal : shrimp perfect, steak way bland and way over temp.  Potatoes : think hospital cafeteria. My partner ordered a bacon n blue burger with fries, side of ranch.  His burger was cooked perfectly, fries hot, thumbs up on his side.   No ranch dressing  on the side though.. and as she never checked back, it remained the only downfall of his burger  As we were ""celebrating"" our first date some 2 years ago at an Applebee's in Cupertino CA (great meal), we decided to order dessert.  We looked over the menu and settled on a few small bite options..  We stacked our dinner plates and placed them on the edge of the table... And we waited... And waited.. And waited.    Finally we gave up on dessert in favor of going home and decided to ask for our check.   Our waitress was right in front of us the entire time we waited...  About 20 feet away at the front door hostess area WITH the same manager who had ignored us earlier.  They were engrossed in conversation for some 5-10 minutes as we finished our meal / wanted dessert.  We interrupted this seemingly personal conversation, got our check, paid and left.  I've spent over 10 years of my life as a waiter..  A damn good waiter. I've always been an over tipper but struggled with even leaving 15%.  The place wasn't busy which can bum a waitress out.  I always saw it as an opportunity to provide BETTER service to increase my tips from the few tables I had.   Certainly not the strategy in play this night.. In the end, we left full of regret and hungry for dessert. I've purposefully not named the guilty parties, but they know who they are.  My partner phoned and spoke with the manager about our concerns. She seemed annoyed.  Offered us a gift card which we declined.    In the present economy, going out to eat is a treat to many.  If the staff put forth some effort, then the patrons would have a more enjoyable meal and leave better tips = staff has a more enjoyable shift.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-quincy-5?start=40

Captain B.,"Weymouth, MA",6,65,21,1.0,1/30/2012,We ate here in January 2012 and found this place to be extremely dirty and dog eared. Bathrooms were filthy and had trash overflowing from the trash can. Bathroom smelled of old urine and needed to be mopped very badly. The toilet had not been cleaned in what looked like days and there was toilet paper on the floor and feces smeared across some of the wall. The womens room was also disgusting and both bathrooms had gang graffiti on the walls.      The restaurant has a smell to it quite probably from the filthy carpets that look like they have never been cleaned. Debris dropped by children including food and such is left under many of the tables. Our table was sticky with not thouroghly cleaned barbecue sauce from a previous customer.       The food was not of good quality and seemed to have been microwaved. Taste quality was bad and not worth the money. There is much better food two blocks away at The Ninety Nine Restaurant so dont waste your money here.      Service was slow and drinks were not refilled in a timely fashion. Management were unresponsive when these issues were brought to them. We do not recommend this restaurant for an enjoyable dining experience,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-quincy-5?start=40
Dan C.,"Abington, MA",0,18,1,1.0,10/8/2009,"Greetings, I have dined at this establishment for the last time. In both scenarios, the steak presented in the $2 for $20 menu could not be cooked to a ""medium"" temperature. In fact, it was served to me ""rare"", and then ""medium rare."" To add insult to injury, the manager never approached our table and the waiter told me directly that ""I hate our cook."" To top it off, the vegetables were saturated in enough butter to send a middle aged man to the ER!  This is yet another example of a corporate restaurant's maketing image failing miserably to match up with the local dining establishment. What is the use of spending millions on televisons ads if the customer suffers are the hands of the service staff (Yes, that includes the kitchen)? Adivice to others, ditch this place.

Richard Y.,"Boston, MA",60,2,,2.0,4/9/2014,"I went here recently for lunch. When we got there, the place was empty besides the staff (that should have been a sign of things to come). While I was not expecting a fully packed restaurant for lunch, I was expecting for there to be at least a few people going there to eat at that time. We were seated immediately to our table and the waitress took our drink order. It took over 10 mins before she came back with our drinks (quite a while when we are the only ones there). All we ordered for drinks was water and a soda. For the food we went with their 2 for $25 menu that includes an appetizer and 2 entrees. For the appetizer we split the Boneless Wings with Spicy Buffalo sauce. According to their menu, it was suppose to be lightly breaded. Not in the least. Every bite tasted more flour than chicken with a hint of buffalo sauce.  Once, our appetizer was finished and we ended up just sitting there, waiting for our entrees. During that whole time the waitress never came to check on us on anything, not even to check if we needed any drink refills or to clear the appetizer plates. The entrees appeared about 30 mins after our appetizer. We had ordered everything at the same time.  I ordered the 4-Cheese Mac & Cheese with Honey Pepper Chicken Tenders, which was decent for mac and cheese but the honey pepper sauce mixed in gave it a weird flavor. The order also came with a bread stick, which was clearly burnt and charred on top. I am surprised they sent it out like so. My friend ordered the Double Crunch Shrimp. I had tried one of the shrimps and that seem to be the only thing that turned out well throughout the whole time we were there. They do give you a lot of food. However, it seemed a hit or miss depending on what you order. While the food and price were decent, I can't get pass the slow and almost lack of service. We were there for almost a complete hour and more than half that time was of us waiting for our foods and drinks. I would understand if they were packed but to be one of the only few tables seated in a pretty much empty restaurant seems unreasonable.
