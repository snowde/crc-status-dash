Jennifer W.,"Columbus, OH",50,16,2,5.0,9/6/2017,"Our normal late night Monday is usually Roosters, due to the holiday it was closed. We went to Applebee's on Brice. I had the $6.99 Bacon Burger with a pile of fries. Fabulous!...it's the Monday special and they don't cut back the size or portion and it was great! Service was great as well. Will definitely be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-reynoldsburg-3
Cierra B.,"Reynoldsburg, OH",34,7,1,1.0,10/25/2017,"Welp! Came out for another family dinner. Oh boy was it a disaster! Applebee's has definitely gone down hill. We ordered 2 for $25 plus appetizer and another appetizer combo. Plus Kids melas our friend ordered the same entree as us.  Our meals meaning adult meals came out first after 25 mins, then our one appetizer. No kids meals no other appetizers. 15 minutes later our kids meals came out missing a hamburger.  No water refills, no Kids refills, and she brought me another $1 margarita without me asking. I did not want another watered down margarita.  45 mins later all three of our appetizer combo comes out. We told our server no, take that back.  We received the bill. Charging us for 4 margaritas. The appetizer combo and an extra Kids meal.   It took another 25 minutes for our server to fix her mistakes. Then after we paid our bill she brings our friend his receipt for his meal. Which we paid for!!! Then argued with us. We asked for a manager which never ever came.  Absolutely horrible service! Also, kitchen was terrible.  We do not recommend this Applebee's.  We will not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-reynoldsburg-3
Sheri S.,"Columbus, OH",54,122,425,4.0,1/3/2018,Half priced appetizers and drink specials for happy hour! Lots of great food and drink for much less!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-reynoldsburg-3
Kenny D.,"Reynoldsburg, OH",182,149,533,3.0,1/9/2017,"I'm having trouble, giving this location a good review.  Historically, we've always received great service here, but not this time. Our server had a great start, being very accommodating.  Unfortunately, that slid as there were large gaps between her follow-ups. My 20 oz steak took longer to prepare, which I expected, due to its size and my ""medium well"" request.  What upset me was the temperature of the remainder of the plate- less than warm.   (When the meat takes longer, wait before you put the food in...) I told her that the steak was delicious, but my other items were on the 'cool' side of warm.  She offered to take the plate up to be warmed, which I accepted.  When she returned, she dropped it off without offering any kind of apology. I also had to make multiple requests for water and we had to make two requests for a carry out container. When it was time to leave, she took our payment but didn't offer any apologies for the bad experience, nor did she say, ""Thank You"" or even goodbye.  Mind you, we were pleasant the entire time and gave no indication of frustration or dissatisfaction. The sad part is that it was my Birthday meal/coupon and she never once even wished me a ""Happy Birthday"".  Not that I needed it. I can say that the steak was fabulous, but that was undone by a shockingly bad service experience. I could have complained to the manager, but I leave that to future customers.  I tend to only summon the manager when I want to extend my praises.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-reynoldsburg-3
Jen J.,"Columbus, OH",0,17,4,5.0,3/5/2017,"I love this place. I'm a regular that frequents 1-2/wk. I usually sit up at the bar unless I bring company. I enjoy their weekday happy hrs and they offer a $6.99/all day everyday miller lite pitchers. Paul is their bartender who's a really cool dude, he makes good conversation with the regulars. The food is good at a decent price. Of course I'll be back, it's a nice place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-reynoldsburg-3
Wilhelm S.,"Omaha, NE",0,3,1,1.0,11/6/2016,"This location is now closed. It had been closed since October 30th, 2016. Sad times in Apple-land. Guess I need to find where there other stores are to get my Applebee's fix.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-reynoldsburg-3
Ruben M.,"Southfield, MI",77,2,1,2.0,7/2/2016,First: the place was half full and there was a 10 min wait. Secondly they host said they were short handed.... there were two workers standing by the bathroom having a long conversation. Lastly the salad I ordered was $12 and only filled half the plate. I asked the waiter who served it about the size and he said it was normal. Needless to say that I didn't come out satisfied. The only good part was our server Adrian.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-reynoldsburg-3
Al S.,"Columbus, OH",0,4,,5.0,5/30/2016,"Great service(Shannon)  Timely, friendly efficient, courteous Food was delicious  Atmosphere inviting",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-reynoldsburg-3
Sabrina H.,"Columbus, OH",115,16,16,4.0,1/20/2016,My daughter suggested it for our night out. The food was tasty and the service was excellent!! I was very impressed considering the location. I guess you can find a gem in the most unlikely places!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-reynoldsburg-3
Paul R.,"Brown Township, OH",156,308,9,4.0,8/18/2014,"Unlike a lot of the previous reviewers,  I had good service.  We came on a Monday evening and found out all their burgers with fries are $5.99 on Mondays.  Sign me up!  All three of our burgers were delicious,  the service was attentive, and our drinks were kept full. Makes me a happy camper. I also learned they have 45 cent wings on Mondays and Thursdays.  Happy hour which includes half price appetizers runs daily from 3pm to 7pm and then 9pm to close.   I will most definitely return when I'm in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-reynoldsburg-3
Bethany K.,"Reynoldsburg, OH",90,323,249,3.0,9/1/2013,"I really love the Oriental Chicken Salad and crispy green bean appetizer.  I haven't dine in the restaurant in quite awhile.  They offer a service of bringing your take out meal to your car, but that stops at dusk. I love a lot of their food, but their service isn't always awesome.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-reynoldsburg-3
Dave M.,"Columbus, OH",2,42,4,2.0,1/4/2016,"I've been an Applebee's fan for years but the food quality has declined. Also, service at this location is spotty at best.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-reynoldsburg-3
Tom R.,"Canal Winchester, OH",0,6,,1.0,1/14/2016,Horrible or non-existent car side service! If you eat here do NOT use car side service since there is NO ONE dedicated to handling cars outside. On phone when you order they ask you make and color of car....but when you get there you have to call them and tell them you are outside. When you do get your order you can plan on something missing.  Quite obviously this service is ordered from their corp. but they don't give a damn about it or customers who use it. First time this happened about 6 months I figured it was just a fluke. went back a week ago and same problems. Lack of mgmt. at this location and no one cares.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-reynoldsburg-3
Cassandra L.,"Reynoldsburg, OH",0,71,8,1.0,1/16/2015,"Used to go often but haven't in awhile. We saw the commercials for the new menu items so went by. The prices have went up and the portions were half or less. I had shrimp and brocolli pasta and my bowl was literally less than half filled. My boyfriend ordered a 9 ounce sirloin and it was maybe 5 ounces at most. $42 and we were not even close to full... I had to go make dinner at home anyway. I'm all for smaller portions, but at $15+ a plate I expect a full dish and to not cook again for second dinner. We love Applebees but we won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-reynoldsburg-3
Garett K.,"Reynoldsburg, OH",55,2,,3.0,6/20/2015,"This is near our house and we have been here a number of times. When the restaurant is not busy (less than half full), the service and food quality are pretty good. However, when most of the tables start filling up, the service and food quality is not very good at all. We've had trouble getting our bill and refills, and the food is often incorrect or cold.  If it's a slow night, I recommend this restaurant. If it's busy, I suggest you go somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-reynoldsburg-3
Kurt K.,"Lancaster, OH",1,57,6,1.0,9/12/2013,"I hate doing a one star review for service.... I really do. If you check my reviews, I will give some places a five star review even though there were issues.  I believe that the service of a place can be essential, true. However I do not like to cut the service staff short when they are not on top of their game because they must deal with all of us.... We came in, and the manager himself greeted my family and I. He seemed very committed in the fact he was happy have gone to the restaurant in his care. That was great, we sat down and it took at least five minutes before our server was there I know it was five minutes because my daughter has a game in her iPod that takes 5 min. Per round, and she completed a round.  Our server was a nice lady, she took our order and drink request. The appetizer showed up 5 minutes later (1 round) and we waited for our drinks.... 3 rounds to be exact.... 15 minutes, we had not seen our server nor almost anyone. Sure we had eaten most of our app.... But 3 drinks, non alcoholic???? 15 minutes and nothing?????? Really?????  Then we asked a server walking by for our server, and my wife demanded the manager..... 1 more round later... (20 minutes since our appetizers had shown) we still had no drinks or visit from anyone.  So we stood up, and walked out the door.  We have an Applebee's gift card that we had planned on using at this location , and chances are never will.  If our server is reading this, mamm you are a nice lady, serious mean that.... But you are as slow as Washington DC in getting things done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-reynoldsburg-3
Ryn M.,"Brewery District, Columbus, OH",0,5,1,1.0,5/16/2014,They literally have the worst service I have ever seen. It disappoints me too because I like their food alot. Everytime I go in there the servers are all standing around and doing nothing and no one is there to seat you. When you are finally seated you get sat at a dirty sticky table. That has happened 3 times to me. Not to mention their carside to go service is a joke. I called in to get food to go and they asked me to come inside and get it and when I did they didn't even get everything I asked for.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-reynoldsburg-3
