A M.,"Alexandria, VA",1,56,301,3.0,11/5/2017,"The waitress was very attentive to our requests and the wait for food was within a reasonable time frame.  The food was hot when served. There was only a few servers that I saw this evening and they all seemed to be working the floor. During our visit I had time to watch the female bartender and noticed some problems. She was friendly to the customer but failed in other ways as far as providing clean service.  I noticed her use the broom and sit it against the wall to prepare a few drinks. She NEVER WASHED her hands.  While preparing the drinks, I saw her put her bare hand deep in a container to retrieve cut fruit and drop in the drink. To top it off, she snapped all the paper off the straw and her hand was on the drinking stem as she put it in the cup.  I then watched her deliver the drinks and rub her hands on her clothes before going on to grab the broom and start the process over again.  I think there is a lot of room for improvement with the bartender knowing the steps to deliver a drink to a customer without bringing germs into the preparation process. (1) Wash your hands at the bar station between cleanup.  (2) Use utensils to retrieve the fruit and place in drink.  (3) Leave the top portion of the straw on the drink if you must add it to the drink.   The parking lot was large as it's connected to a small strip mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-17
Austin M.,"Richmond, VA",35,132,11,2.0,12/14/2017,"I came in here one Sunday to watch some football, have a drink and maybe some food.  When I walked in no one really paid any attention to me.  It was pretty empty so I walked up and had a seat at the bar.  I waited around noticing two gentlemen who worked there, looking at a phone at the end of the bar.  One looked up and noticed me, and another person seemed to notice me as well near the entrance to the kitchen.  I continued waiting and after 5 minutes of no one even saying hi, or acknowledging me I decided to leave.  I could understand if it was busy, or if at least half full, but I was the only one at the bar, and three-four tables with people at them.  So it was an easy decision to head out.  It is a shame because I used to love Applebees, but it seemed that no one was really interested in working.  I was going to give it 1 star, but I didn't have any food or drinks so I can't say anything, just that no one really paid attention or seemed to want to work.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-17
A'tasha C.,"Richmond, VA",82,9,1,1.0,12/7/2017,"At some point, we need to address that this location should not be in business. It closes at 11pm, although the website indicates midnight. Last call is not announced and the server did not share that it was last call. The manager was a bit apathetic to  my feedback. Just close down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-17
Nikki R.,"Severn, MD",1,21,,2.0,9/24/2017,"I'm being very generous giving this particular Applebees a 2 star. Service took forever despite the restaurant not being the least bit crowded. The server was just ok. Not overly attentive but I've had worse. She didnt come back to check if anyone needed drink refills... we had to locate her and ask... which we found that we pretty much had to do that for anything we needed. A ""better than ok"" server checks on their customers from time to time. The bar is extremely unaccommodating when I wanted to upgrade the liquor being used from 1800 to Patron, when I've done this plenty of times at other Applebee's.  This one wouldnt do it... SMH.  I just didnt get a great experience. It was just decent enough to get by. You may be satisfied going here if youre not looking for anything but a fairly decent restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-17
August E.,"Richmond, VA",5,216,1442,3.0,4/18/2017,"Food was not hot even though it was a weekday and not many people there. In fact it was so slow our server said they were sending her home after serving us. I probably won't be returning to this location. Food was mediocre, hostess was clueless about happy hour times.

Calvin G.,"Richmond, VA",1,17,,1.0,8/20/2017,"If I could give this Apple Bees near Willow lawn  a zero I would but yelp doesnt allow zero ,well all the Apple Bees restaurants in Richmond suck, I don't know why we chose to come eat here on Saturday when we knew it wasn't gonna be good, no specials at all my friend wanted to sample a drink before she bought it the bar tender wouldn't allow it ,she ended up hating the drink and had to give it back I'm so surprised this Apple Bees is still open, TGI FRIDAYS SUCKS TO but at least they have the endless apps, Apple Bees is over priced and the food is Garbage please close this restaurant down its a health hazard and a disgrace to the city of RVA we will not be back u couldn't give me the food at Apple Bees for free that's how bad it is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-17

They are so watered down. You literally would have to drink about 10 to even get tipsy. I ended up having to buy the regular priced drinks. I was celebrating my friends 30th Birthday.

Walter B.,"Richmond, VA",0,20,,1.0,7/7/2016,"Overpriced, lousy service, and crappy sized portions. Everything tastes like it was warmed up in a microwave.  I ordered a Caesar salad and the bowl was half empty, the lettuce was warm and the  chicken on top was cold. Terrible meal and this was my last one I will ever eat at there. There are a ton of better chain restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-17
Veronica H.,"Midlothian, VA",0,9,6,1.0,9/2/2016,This is the worst place ever. Slow service poor service and bad management. Will never ever no matter how hungry go here. They should close this place. A disgrace to the area.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-17
D M.,"Charlotte, NC",2,2,,1.0,11/8/2016,"The service and server, Jasmine C were great, however the food was not and the manager, John Ball was even less so. I had the spinach dip and wings, and while the dip was lujke warm and the cheese congealed I didn't complain. My WINGS though...that's a different story, I don't play with my wings and these were the nastiest wings I've ever had from Applebee's, they were cold and tasted like they'd been rewarmed and had soft soggy skin instead of fried hard like I asked and the sauce...OMG I can't!! When I told the server I didn't want the wings she said she would take it off of my bill. Then the manager shows up and tells me that although I didn't like them I still had to pay for them...I thought my head was going to spin around on my neck!! How in the world are you going to make me pay for something that was not to my satisfaction? And he called the police! I asked the officer if he'd ever been out to eat and paid for something he wasn't satisfied with and he his look said it all, John Ball was being a AHole and they knew it. Nevertheless we had to pay or go to the clinker. I called his district manager and corporate office. I have never had such poor customer service in my life not to mention having the police called...John Ball needs to take some customer service classes or find a new line of work. #WaitiingToSeeHowThisIsHandled",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-17
Keegan Z.,"Richmond, VA",88,225,672,4.0,9/25/2014,"I hadn't been to an Applebee's in a long time prior to this, so I was glad to have such an enjoyable experience on this particular visit. This location was very attractive inside and out, and I got a sense that they were really trying to rise above the somewhat negative association some diners attribute to their chain. Our service was friendly, and came back occasionally to ensure we were fine. The 2 for $25 deal was stellar, and we both picked the mac and cheese/bacon/chicken entree; it did not disappoint! Applebee's tends to not give out coupons, though if you look at the pricing, you can see why: it's pretty affordable all the time, and the mixed drinks are a good deal as well. I'd like to mention that I mistakenly believed later in the evening that I had misplaced my phone and left it at the restaurant. While that turned out not to be the case (I eventually found it elsewhere), the staff here were incredibly helpful and patient with me as I tried to retrace my steps to locate it. Thanks, Applebee's. This place may not be the pinnacle of dining, though they provided a good solid experience for me and I will definitely return. Overall: 4.0 stars -------------- Pros: - Food is great, and some of the options are quite different from other chains. - Pricing is reasonable. - Excellent service on this occasion. - Attractive interior/exterior, and easy parking. Cons: - Could have been more callbacks as my lady friend and I ran out of our drinks at one point, though this can happen anywhere. - Staff members did seem to be congregating in a booth near us, and as a former server, I can tell you that hanging out while on shift is frowned upon by managers everywhere. Wasn't really hurting anyone on this occasion, though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-17
Heather M.,"Henrico, VA",17,71,96,1.0,2/1/2016,"Saturday night we went to 3 different restaurants, we were starving and didn't want to wait the 40+ minutes everybody was quoting us. So in a last ditch effort to get some food into our hangry bellies, we decided to go to Applebee's.  There was no wait, but the dining area was pretty full.  I didn't have high hopes for the evening after it took almost 10 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us after sitting down. We ordered our drinks and then it was another 10+ minutes before our waiter ever came back! He was super nice, so I feel bad but he just seemed so awkward and just didn't seem to have a good flow. He took our orders, and after a few minutes we received only the mozzarella sticks of our build your own appetizer... He came back and verified we ordered mozzarella sticks (but didn't confirm the second option -- pretzels w/ beer cheese) so when he brought us the 4 mozz sticks on a plate and took off, we were confused if we were going to get the rest of our appetizer? Finally the pretzels and beer cheese did come. It seemed really awkward to me -- if I was a waiter and only delivering half of an order I feel like an acknowledgement such as ""the rest will be on it's way in a moment"" would be appropriate.  Then we got out entrees -- I ordered the triple bacon burger which was supposed to have bacon, cheese, and barbecue bacon ranch. When the burger came it didn't have the bacon ranch and seemed to be just a plain bacon burger. That wouldn't have been an issue except we were still charged for the triple bacon burger price! Also, the burger was REALLY dry. I ordered it with a little pink and it was close to well-done. My boyfriend said his jalapeno burger was just ""okay"". All in all, the food was sub-par. The poor waiter was just so awkward and clumsy the whole experience was just really awkward. I don't know if he was just really new at waiting tables or what. I did notice while we were waiting on our food that a lot of the tables seemed to be having similar issues. I overheard that one table just never received one of their entrees. It seemed like the waitstaff just wasn't making their rounds like one would expect. It's been years since I've been to an Applebee's and I don't think after this experience we'll be going back any time soon!

Yvonne M.,"Richmond, VA",224,629,786,4.0,5/16/2012,"car side to go. I had one of the most friendliest servers (Evan)come out to the car to bring my food. I had a huge order for 9 people. The server took the time to ask me how my day was going, joked with me about being the one sent to get lunch for the entire office and then asked which order was mine and then told me it was a good choice. I ordered blackened Tilapia, baked potato w/bacon & cheese and garden veggies. Everything was perfectly cooked.  It seems the trick to ccar side t go is to go early. I ordered at 11:30, food was ready and piping hot at 11:55 as promised.    Tipped Evan well for being so nice and handling my food quickly. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-17
Eris P.,"Richmond, VA",5,19,4,2.0,3/10/2015,"I will start out by saying I have never been a fan of Applebee's. However, I received a gift card and decided to give them another chance, after being away for several years. I looked online at the various menus and chose to go with brisket nachos. I couldn't believe someone thought to put two of my most favorite things together. I should have been a little more thoughtful of my choice, perhaps. Anyway, I go to pick up my order along with my sons order of chicken tenders with french fries, and I'm greeted by a very polite waitress. I get home and my husband is immediately taken aback by how large the container for my nachos is. However, when we opened it we were greeted by about 100 tortilla chips, 20 of which had cheese on them, and *maybe* 1 ounce of brisket meat. It was awful. My son enjoyed his chicken at least. I will not be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-17
Jahmelia C.,"Henrico, VA",0,6,2,1.0,10/18/2016,"A coworker and I decided to order Applebee's carside to go during on dinner break. I had never tried car side to go  but all my coworkers were raving about how awesome it is. I decided to give it a whirl. I placed my order online and was told it would be ready at 718pm. I arrived at 720pm and sat there for a moment unsure of what happens next.  As I still had not been greeted yet I gave the restaurant a call at 725. The woman who answered said she had no idea what I ordered so she needed me to repeat my order.  After giving her my order again she said she would be out in a few minutes.  At 740 pm, 15 minutes after I called her she finally came out with my food.  She disappeared with my corporate card and 5 minutes later her manager appeared my receipt.  He didn't apologize he just said ""hey were busy it's Saturday"" and ran off to help the next customer.  As I mentioned earlier I've never done carside to go before but I'm fairly certain it shouldn't take 25 minutes to get your food. My food was cold and the overall experience put a bad taste in my mouth. Myself and my company will never order food from here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-17

Dustin C.,"Henrico, VA",45,2,,1.0,10/4/2015,I'll start off by saying the roos there was great and the arrive was great also. The waitress Stephanie was awesome. The only thing I didn't like about resturant was the manger and how doesn't take care of his staff. Mostly when they complain about the drunk guts there grabbing or slapping there asses. I don't take kindly to that kind of shit. Ya'll need to get ya'll act together and take care of your staff. Instead all you do is tell staff to just deal with it. If they feel uncomfortable about that you should tell the drunks to leave. All ya'll are concerned about money and making sure everyone is having good time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-17
Dani N.,"Springfield, VA",98,24,,1.0,4/29/2012,"After 10pm, there aren't that many choices left in richmond. But if you're hungry, you get desperate. So the boyfriend and I figure that we haven't been to an Applebee's in years...and that night after trying to eat our meal, we found out why it's been so long. Everything in the appetizer sampler tasted like it was from the walmart frozen food section. I had the riblets, which were as thin as cardboard, but tasted more bland. I tried to fill myself up by eating the fries, but they had this weird artificial after taste to them. Lesson learned. The waitress was really nice though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-17
Jamie B.,"Henrico, VA",0,16,1,1.0,7/13/2013,"My boyfriend and I decided to go out to Applebee's tonight for a Saturday date night. We arrived there right at 7 and the place was as dead as can be...and now I know why. We walked in and the hostess who greeted us was very nice and friendly, but this seemed to be the best and only good part of the night. We were sat and waited on by Shane G., who only had 1 other table because it was so empty. We ordered the pretzels as an appetizer and then my bofriend ordered the Quesadilla Burger and I ordered the Margarita Queso Chicken & Shrimp. We've both had each at another location and thought they'd be a good and safe choice.  After waiting for over 30 mins our food finally arrives. Mychicken came out decent but my boyfriend's burger was mushy and not cooked all the way through. It was obvious to me that our dishes had been sitting out for awhile since the waiter somehow managed to forget about our food and that it was reheated in the microwave. Naturally, we got our food and Shane again forgets about us even though now we are his only table. Eventually he came back, smelling like an ash tray, when we were almost finished with our meals and our waters had both been empty for several minutes. He asked us how the food was as quickly as possible and left immediately before we could tell him we were planning to get dessert and wanted refills on our waters. The manager on duty was oblivious to what was going on in the restaurant. Our entire meal he was at the bar flirting with the bartender. He did not notice when our food was sitting out, that it had to be heated up in the microwave, that tables around us were dirty, or that there were tables unattended. I can tell why the service was so bad. This location will continue to be awful under his ""leadership"". Needless to say we will make the further trip to the other location near Pemberton to get better service the next time we crave for some food from Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-richmond-17
