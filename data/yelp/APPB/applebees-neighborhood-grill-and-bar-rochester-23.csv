Jason L.,"Stoddard, WI",13,13,,4.0,12/25/2017,Pros; friendly service and same type of food found any other Applebees. Cons;m usic was a bit loud and the mozzarella   sticks are not worth the money.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rochester-23
Cassandra T.,"Phoenix, AZ",26,5,14,5.0,6/13/2017,I was pleased with the service. The waiter was very friendly and attentive. Our food came out very fast. I ordered the spinach artichoke pasta dish and it was amazing. It tasted just like the spinach and artichoke dip Applebees has. It was very convenient to pay on a little tablet kiosk on our table. It figured out a tip for us. We could send the receipt to our email. Nice place to relax.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rochester-23
Yusef T.,"Phoenix, AZ",18,19,15,4.0,6/13/2017,So the  wife and I decided to go out to Applebees and get a little redemption from the last time we were here and had the most horrid experience......This time? Had a great experience! Our server Darryl was FANTASTIC! Explained menu items very well...and took care of us..... We love coming on Monday burger nights because the burgers are awesome for 1 and secondly they are $6 every Monday......So we decided to with something a little different tonight The entree I ordered was meh.....I ordered the 3 cheese Chicken pasta.....pretty bland....I usually order the burgers here...because they rock! But we decided to go with something different.... Wasn't impressed with my pasta...my wife's was awesome though... At least it was a great experience..just wish my pasta had more flavor....Till our next visit Applebees!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rochester-23
Cassie D.,"Rochester, MN",4,17,,3.0,6/13/2017,"Had to come in for a nice cold bloody mary and some nachos. Decent american style food, large helpings. We like to come in for their burgers too. Prices are about average, service is good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rochester-23
Angie T.,"Rochester, MN",0,5,,1.0,4/24/2016,"The service is very sub par. The ribs have no meat on them and pastas all taste like they are from a box. The manager is in a daze and has no clue where and how his servers are lacking,  but they Really are! Applebee's used to be a decent restaurant 10 years ago, now it just seems to be a food court restaurant with servers (a generous word for these employees ).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rochester-23
Debra S.,"Rochester, MN",0,7,2,1.0,9/7/2016,"They messed up my car side to go, so I had to go back to get my forgotten ideas.  The manager treated my like I was lying to him and that he didn't was to give me the food they had forgotten.  They kept talking about the chili I had ordered but that was not my order.  I did get the food they had forgotten but I'm not about to go back there if that's how management acts.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rochester-23
Jamie B.,"Minneapolis, MN",75,4,,2.0,1/15/2016,"I came in for late night dinner with my two girlfriends. There were two young hostess's working. A caucasian female with long brown hair in a pony tail, and an african american female with shorter hair. There was a bit of a crowd. They asked how many without greeting us first. I said the wrong number at first and the caucasian female mocked me and smirked. They also did not tell us an estimated wait time. I had to ask them and they seemed annoyed we were asking.  We had a nice server but she must have gotten our order wrong. My friend ordered pretzels and recieved mozzarella sticks. The blonde food runner who brought over her food rolled her eyes at my friend when she said that she did not order mozzerella sticks. Then, not even a minute later, another person brought over the mozzerella sticks again but this time just dropped it off and didnt give us time to say anything. So we waited for our server and said for the second time that we did not order that.  As we were walking out, the caucasian hostess with long brown hair smirked and rolled her eyes at us. No one said goodbye or thank you.  It was a very unprofessional atmosphere and we did not feel welcome. The employees need to be trained on what good customer service is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rochester-23
A M.,"Fairview Heights, IL",0,29,3,1.0,5/22/2016,"This location use to be our go to over the mall location any day but last night definitely made me question whether we should give the mall location another go. We were seated after a short wait as always because the host never seems to be at the door. When she finally sat us though she was very friendly and told us about the night specials. Then came more waiting. Our waitress passed our table at least 4 times and every time she told us she'd be right with us for 15 minutes. We all just ordered waters right away because we didn't want to commit to staying because the whole restaurant seemed in a tizzy. Dropped glasses by waitresses, STICKY TABLES (as usual), and hushed comments from surrounding tables. It took another 10 minutes for the waitress to bring us our waters. By that time we were ready to order and she couldn't take our orders fast enough. She barely let us finish as she rushed off. The restaurant wasn't too busy but there were a few large tables (that already had their food) so I naively expected ours to come out quickly. 20 minutes later our food arrived at our table, or so we thought. It turned out to belong to the table behind us after we questioned all the items she set in front of us. That table was sat at least 20 minutes after us too and they got their food before us! Same number of people in their party! When our correct food finally came out only part of it did. By the time the remaining sides came out our main dishes were practically done. I didn't get a single refill the entire 2 hours we were here and our waitress barely looked at our table as she continued to rush by. The manager seemed done with the night and didn't even stop by any of the tables to check on how the customers were- probably because she knew she'd get an earful. None of the staff looked happy to be there and the new waitress that walked by looked like she was reevaluating her decision to work there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rochester-23
Erika K.,"Grand Rapids, MN",29,2,,2.0,5/12/2015,Service was ok...ordered the Fiesta chicken salad had to send back because they forgot the main thing. The bean salsa with corn. Appetizers were cold. And nothing like I saint clouds Applebee's! !,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rochester-23
Lindsay W.,"Rochester, MN",0,2,,1.0,4/10/2016,"We decided to go here with our 4 kids today for lunch...bad idea! The server wasn't overly rude, but wasn't polite either.  Seemed as though she could care less about her job and customers. Even the host/hostess seemed kind of rude and lost/confused. We waited probably 45 minutes for our cold food to arrive...What a waste of an hour and a half. The manager could clean himself up a little bit as well...unkempt and water or grease stains all over his shirt. Very disappointing! Won't be returning anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rochester-23
Carrie D.,"Wilkes-Barre, PA",0,28,10,1.0,3/12/2016,Entered restaurant with a foul smell. The table was sticky to touch. My party couldn't decide what to order.  The waitress was impatient and rude. We decided to leave when drinks arrived. Manager tried to fix it but we didnt want to stay. He gave us free drinks.  The same rude waitress argued with us leaving. Worse experience ever!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rochester-23
Les S.,"Rochester, MN",0,29,1,3.0,2/27/2016,The food was good and price was decent. We got the 2 for $20 deal. But the service was LOUSY. We had to wait 20 minutes just to get the receipt.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rochester-23
Hosea H.,"Rochester, MN",0,3,,1.0,2/9/2016,"Awazing food, but the wait staff needs help. Management does not know how to fix this problem.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rochester-23
Julia Q.,"Bartlesville, OK",0,3,,1.0,11/18/2015,Very disappointing! My salmon was burned and over cooked. It was $14.49. Total waste of money. The chicken tenders tasted like they were warmed up in a microwave. I'm not sure what is happening with Applebee's food. I'm not going to be eating at one anymore.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rochester-23
Michael Y.,"Long Beach, CA",0,13,,1.0,3/4/2014,Ate here tonight.  Had the Cowboy Burger.  Asked for a salad also.  Asked for the salad first and got it.  It was good.  When the burger came it was missing the breaded onions.  When asked about it I was brought a plate with grilled onions no breading on it.  After I cut my burger in half it was PINK all the way from the outside to center.  Barely cooked. I had asked for it no pink but obviously that wasn't happening.  I brought this up to the waiter and he brought my bill with the salad removed.  From there I asked the manager to remove the burger and that I would pay for salad.   He told me I could pay nothing.   Not going back here.  Ever.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rochester-23
Yan N.,"Rochester, MN",10,10,28,3.0,2/22/2014,"I like happy hour there! It's very good deal there! And also I really like the meal for $20 , it's very good too! But only thing I don't like, It is about the steak! I know the price is good, but really need to improve the steak , when I order medium , it is always come well done! When I order medium rare , It came like rare or either cook too well! But most things was good!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rochester-23
Rasean S.,"Rochester, MN",1,1,,2.0,8/5/2014,Food was good. The hosting and service was horrible... We sat for 8 minutes for greeting and when we ordered drinks our waters took 5 minutes and our alcoholic beverages took 1 minute. Food is good as always but you really need to work on the communication and service part of your business.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rochester-23
Stan L.,"Humeston, IA",0,98,15,2.0,8/12/2013,"I have been pestering my wife to eat at an Appleby's. I have always like their food. This was our first visit to this one. We had the 2 for $24 special. I had the chicken and  Penne and my wife had shrimp and chicken. Our appetizer was the Nikon rings. The dip with the onion rings was a bar-b-que sauce. It was pasty and had an off flavor. Our main courses were just average at best. Very disappointed in the entire meal. The ice tea wasn't even good. Appeared to have a background flavor. Might have been instant. Service was fair, but the waitress seemed to be some what short with answers to our questions about the menu. Doubt that I will return",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rochester-23
chris b.,"Rochester, MN",4,99,10,2.0,12/25/2010,"Its an applebees, pretty much like every applebees I've ever eaten at but with better more attentive service.    Much of the food taste homogenized and ""food service"".   Bar service is always very attentive and they have good happy hour specials. How somebody can rate an applebees 5 stars is beyond me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rochester-23
Geno B.,"Minneapolis, MN",14,14,3,2.0,5/1/2013,Received cold food and a rock hard bread stick. Not a good first impression. Was offered a different meal. In the end received a little off on the price.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rochester-23
Dave A.,"Rochester, MN",50,217,63,5.0,12/16/2011,"I have to upgrade my review one more time, to 5 stars. The food at this restaurant seems better every time I eat there.

E. N.,"Rochester, MN",0,3,,5.0,3/19/2010,"There is simply not a better managed chain restaurant in the country, in my opinion. The General Manager here has received numerous accolades and/or nominations as the best GM in Minnesota, etc... They in fact have four managers that every restaurant would be lucky to have... Their staff is well trained and flexible to the needs of every guest. Late nights can get really crazy here with all the half-price appetizers, but if you have a little patience, you'll realize, there's no place that gives you more value and better service after 9PM than you get at Applebees Marketplace in Rochester.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rochester-23?start=20
Elena H.,"El Sobrante, CA",0,207,394,4.0,6/15/2010,We ate here and found the place reasonable though no difference than other Applebee restaurants you can find in other areas.   Service was good and food was excellent.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rochester-23?start=20
