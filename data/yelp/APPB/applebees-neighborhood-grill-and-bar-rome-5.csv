B L.,"Flagstaff, AZ",48,45,25,5.0,11/28/2017,It is Applebees. Good food. Good service. Good drinks. Ask for Jessica. She's a doll.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rome-5
David Y.,"Baltimore, MD",162,5,,4.0,2/28/2017,This is an Applebees. You know what you're getting for the most part. But I've been to three really bad Applebees recently (life) but this was one of the better ones in a long time! The breakfast burger was good and the usual staples were done better than the last few I have been to!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rome-5
Ciara M.,"Rome, NY",94,9,10,3.0,12/1/2016,Decent food. Can't mess up a beer! Drinks are always good. Fun to play trivia on the little tablet too!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rome-5
Amanda H.,"Utica, NY",0,11,,5.0,12/8/2015,"We've eaten here on occasion over the years, never was anything super fantastic, but it's chain food, so we knew what we were getting.  Tonight, I took my youngest 2 kids on a ""date"" and we decided on Applebee's.  I ordered my daughter's food for her (cheeseburgers off the kids menu, no buns, with fries. She can't have wheat, so this was an easy fix). I ordered the Stout Beer Chicken (one of my favorites), and my son ordered the kid's steak with fries.  Our server, Lester, came back out and asked if she had a gluten allergy, I said yes, and he apologized that they had put her burgers on buns accidentally and they would remake them. He also said that the fries could be cross-contaminated, to which I replied that was not an issue, her allergy isn't anaphylactic and cross contamination isn't an issue for fries, she just can't eat the bread etc. He was super cool and I thanked him for being so attentive to her needs.  When our food came out I helped the kids first, and then returned to my meal. My chicken was completely burned. I called my server back over and let him know that it was burned. He offered me a refund or new meal, I asked for another, but to go as the kids would be done before it came out, and at 5 and 7, I wouldn't expect them to sit for an extra 20-30 minutes. He apologized profusely, and the manager also came to the table and apologized and explained what had happened in the kitchen. She said that she would take care of it. I thanked her and the kids finished up.  Lester brought out my new meal, and asked me to verify that it was ok before he packaged it up, and got it ready to go for me. We got our check, and I was shocked to see that the manager had 100% comped my meal, I didn't expect that, and it was very kind. I expected dinner to be about $40, and even with tax it came to just less than $22. I was more than happy to leave the full $40 I planned to pay, and left a thank you (in kids crayon LOL) for Lester. He earned it. He is a fantastic server, and was so kind to the kids, coming to their level to let them order, and being attentive to us. Very pleased.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rome-5
Douglas G.,"Escondido, CA",62,3,5,1.0,7/10/2016,"Standing in line, 8 empty tables and 4 groups waiting to be seated, everyone is being told it's a 15-20 minute wait! Really?? Just watched two other people walk out. Standing here in the lobby because they won't sit us at the bar to watch the Eurocup with a child. Not to mention its 70 degrees outside and the AC is blasting... Walking away also.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rome-5
Victory G.,"Syracuse, NY",6,99,,4.0,4/25/2015,"We were out of options on a recent trip, and decided to stop here, despite my general ban on chains.  We've been to this location before, and it was usually ""meh.""  They've done a massive overhaul on the menu - I was shocked at how good my meal was.  Every table now has an iPad-style device, where you can play trivia and other games (for a buck added to your bill, presumably to pay for these things), summon the waitress, see your bill, order drinks, etc.  It's neat.   We started with the pretzel sticks, which come with a sweet and flavorful mustard, and a decent cheese sauce.  The pretzels were crispy on the outside, but soft and doughy on the inside.  Among the best pretzels I've tried.   I had this chicken maple bacon sandwich, which was served in a sort of charred (not overly) flatbread.  It was incredible - the chicken was grilled and flavorful, the maple flavor was sufficiently strong to stand out properly, and the bacon was delightfully crispy.  The menu has all sorts of great choices, and there's a focus on lower-calorie fare.   Very surprising - clearly they've done some homework.  I'll actually be excited to come back...to a chain!  Crazy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rome-5
Rufy S.,"Rome, NY",0,1,,1.0,10/30/2016,Went last Sunday during football game. Barmaid was great. Food was horrible. Best thing I can say about it is that I did not get food poisoning. Absolutely the worst Applebee's chain I have visited in the US.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rome-5
Tony R.,"Rome, NY",1,7,1,1.0,8/2/2014,"Went to Applebee's  a couple of nights ago. Never again, my steak was not cooked right the veggies were  not cooked and the mashed potatoes wee Luke warm . They gave me a whole new meal and it was not any better. The manager left so I had no recourse . So I paid for our meal left a modest. Tip and left. I will not return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rome-5
Sirinda S.,"Los Angeles, CA",125,558,52,4.0,7/31/2011,"3.5 stars  Yay, they serve fried haddock!  I'm always eager to get my fill of haddock whenever I visit the East Coast, as on the West Coast we tend to get cod instead of haddock.  The fried haddock was crispy, hearty, and hugely portioned and while the fries weren't anything extra special, they were really good.  Service was friendly and efficient.  I didn't find a lot of dining options in Rome, so surprisingly I found Applebees to be a good option.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rome-5
Julie S.,"Lee Center, NY",28,67,24,4.0,1/4/2014,You get what you order. Food is warm beer is cold and cosmopolitans are strong. Very busy. It looks like each meal has been cloned from one just like it. :-) I like it though. Easy fast and tasty.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rome-5
Christy P.,"Columbus, OH",29,28,12,2.0,11/18/2012,"The food has been a disappointment 9 of 10 times. Service is decent 80% of the time. Atmosphere can be a little noisy but a decent sports bar area. The specials after 9pm are great but would hope for more of a variety in their types of drink specials. Some of them are decent tasting and others aren't made properly. Beer specials are great, but I believe they all have specials.  All in all, we go to the Rome location for drinks and the new Hartford location for great food, excellent service and a great atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rome-5
CJ D.,"Dayton, OH",5,27,36,3.0,5/3/2006,"Category: Casual Dining The service here, for a franchise, is top notch.  I took some time to talk to the staff as well as the owner one day and came to the conclusion that this establishment is more than just another franchise - a lot of care and effort has gone into getting everything right. Meals are traditional American Fare with some Californian and Tex-Mex highlights in the way of rollups, creative burgers, and grilled fajitas.  Conveniently located as well. *All of CJ's reviews fall into three categories - Fine Dining, Casual Dining, or Takeout.  To give fair consideration to all types of restaurants one must not consider the same judging factors in any of these three categories.  For fine dining the ambiance is lent greater weight, while for takeout a majority of the weight is placed upon taste and convenience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rome-5
