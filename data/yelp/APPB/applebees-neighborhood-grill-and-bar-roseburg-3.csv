Denise M.,"Edmonds, WA",31,30,53,3.0,11/13/2017,"I haven't been to Applebee's in awhile. It is always a sure bet on the food scale. I love to get the Oriental chicken salad. So this is what I ordered cuz it sounded so good. Unfortunately it wasn't as good as I remembered it being. I'm not sure why, but it did have a lot more of the torn lettuce in it. I enjoyed it even so and will possible try it again someday. I think different locations are better than others and this was our first time at the one in Roseburg. My husband said the ribs were fair ( not as good as mine!). I spoil him.  Not a stand out meal so I have to give it a 3.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-roseburg-3
Craig J.,"Roseburg, OR",14,16,,2.0,8/22/2017,"We were pleasanty greeted by their hostess, who seated us quickly and made sure were comfortable with our location.  Once our waitress arrived however things went down hill. We ordered 2 peach margaritas on rocks, and our server Ashley took it upon herself to make them top shelf. We sent those back for the house margaritas and got peach Koolaid mixed with HFCS and a couple drops of tequila.  For our food we got salads and the 3 cheese chicken with cavatapi.  Hardly any cheese. High points of this visit, the salads had great croutons,  the pasta was cooked nicely, and the water was filtered. #nevergoingback",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-roseburg-3

The blackberry tea and blackberry lemonade was good...  couldnt get enough...  so...  thirsty...

Trena R.,"Oakland, OR",0,43,,2.0,1/9/2018,"A group of us went to Applebees for the endless bbq ribs which were delicioius. The reason for the low score is not the taste of the food but for two reasons.  The first batch of ribs we all got were cold. Yes, lukewarm in some places , refrigerator cold in other places on the ribs like mouth fulls of refrigerator cold ribs.  Second, the waitress kept wiping her nose from customer to customer she waited on she was constantly rubbing her nose on her sleeve. we were wondering if this was a habit of hers so much so she was not aware of doing this or what.  As we got batch after batch of ribs they got hoter to the last one which was really hot. We ordered the ice peach tea too. It was ice tea diluted in so much ice with chucks of canned peaches in the bottom and ones that were canned in water not syrup. i about got nauseated and did not drink mine. the cost was 4 bucks a person for the tea. so that is why the restaurant gets a two stars. Also the waitress flipped from customer to customer ignoring us at first we sat for 15 minutes before she even addressed us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-roseburg-3

I could have used a refill on my drink, my son wanted a to go box for the remainder of his meal, but you were no where to be found.

Saw this place on my GPS and after a great meal at another Applebee's thought I would stop for lunch and see if the meal consistency was the same as in my other visits to this chain establishment.   Bottom line:   It was a great meal.  The service was good from my young server.  Had the 4 cheese penna which was part of their 2 for $ 20. Both meals were excellent.  If your looking a nice place for a meal try an Applebee's and report the results.

Tracey L.,"Gervais, OR",20,41,3,2.0,7/14/2017,"Hesitant to go back to this Applebee's... having just moved to Roseburg, my husband and I were out on a late night date and wanted to get a little appetizer and dessert. We got some chips and some kind of chocolate dessert and my husband ordered a soda as well. The food was decent, and my husband enjoyed his soda. I took a few sips of his drink as well to try it (we don't buy soda at home) but mostly drank my own water. My husband asked for a refill and the waitress said ""Oh, I'll actually get in big trouble if my manager finds out I gave you a refill because we're not allowed to do that when people share drinks. I'll sneak you one though!"" Um, where's Big Brother of Applebees hiding cameras and caught me taking 2-3 sips?! And what does soda even cost a franchise like Applebees?! We thought that was really weird. We've never had a problem with ""sharing"" drinks at any restaurant even if we completely split meals and drinks. I will typically order my own beverage if I know I'll drink it all, but most of the time I can only take a few sips otherwise I get filled up on sugary drinks before even eating my food.

I have been so disappointed the last several times I have gone that I won't be back. I really enjoyed going there too since it is one of the better places in town. The last time we were there I had the bourbon steak and shrimp. I have had this dish many many times as I consider it one of the best in the menu. It was horrible. I'm not sure what they did but it was not flavored correctly and floating in a weird substance. My husbands shrimp were so fried that they barely had any flavor.

Art M.,"Castro Valley, CA",0,27,1,3.0,8/12/2014,"The food was tasty and our server was friendly. My wife and I each had the 3 cheese penne pasta with grilled chicken on the  2-for-$20 menu. The flavor was excellent. Unfortunately, it was plated haphazardly. Mine had 2 small strips of chicken and no visible Alfredo sauce. My wife's had several pieces of chicken and a generous amount of sauce. She was glad to share her excess chicken and the waitress brought extra sauce. We made an acceptable entree in this way, but it should have been done in the kitchen. The preparation time was a bit longer than I would have expected. The ceasar salad was served on a warm plate. Again, good recipe, poor execution The table seemed sticky so we asked the waitress to wipe it for us. She explained that there was some reaction between the urethane finish and the cleaning product they use, it couldn't be remedied. An offer for a free perk popped up on the free wifi. Apparently an appetizer or a dessert was available to those who completed the online form. Our server didn't know about it, she sent the manager over. He said perfunctorily that  he didn't think this restaurant participated in the offer, but he would honor it. Since he never returned, no perk was forthcoming. No big deal, just poor handling.

However when our food came out that honey pepper sauce was all over the chicken tenders so I pointed out how that was a mistake and I had ordered it on the side and then took it to the back well little did I know that they would not remake the entire dish instead they scraped off the chicken tenders and the sauce that they could see and recooked the chicken but gave me the same old pasta. Now if I was allergic I would have sued their ass. I can't believe the managers that would allow that and I can't believe the cook that would serve something like that.

The reason they only got a 2 star review was because of the waiters . What should of been a 20 min lunch turned into a hour and a half. Our food got to us on a decent time but we had to wait 30 min for are dessert. We had the blonde and it really saved this review. No joke our waiter was sitting at a table talking to one of her friends that came in for lunch. For to people it was 35 $ which seems pretty pricey. The horrible customer service is what knocked this review to a 1 and dessert saved it to a 2 .

However, over the last several months they seem to have developed some issues stemming from a general lack of organization/management.  Issues with the wait staff being uncoordinated with their service gaps resulting in some minor and sometimes major inconveniences.   In the kitchen, some dishes are occasionally, randomly unavailable.  Food preparation is at times slow and sometimes there's inconsistencies in dish preparation from one time to the next.   A dish that you enjoyed last time may therefore either not be available or not meet your expectations this time.   These issues do not seem to be related to the current business volume They occur when the restaurant is busy, or not busy. In general, we enjoy Applebee's menu and the staff, as individuals, do well.  These issues seem to reflect systemic organizational/management issues.

Connie L.,"Coos Bay, OR",206,331,62,4.0,12/3/2010,"Okay, so I've had locals ask why we'd be willing to drive well over an hour to eat at... an Applebee's. There are several good reasons! The most important is the happy employees. Never have been able to figure out what it is about the people working at the Roseburg Applebee's but they sure seem to like what they do!  Maybe it's the coastal rain that makes people so grumpy at times... but if I can't find a happy place to even have a meal locally, I don't mind driving! We actually met folks in a neighboring booth on our last visit, and developed fast friendship, exchanging information with promises to reunite one day! I can't say as I've ever had that happen with perfect strangers in my own home town. I have, however been scolded for humming Christmas Carols in a retail store; pushed out of the way and yelled at by a customer who obviously wanted to go down the isle I was perusing FIRST, and occasionally we find someone seemingly happy in their job.  Applebee's to me, is like the McDonald's Mercedes version. You know exactly what you're going to get when you order, and anticipate exactly how it will taste, no matter which Applebee's you visit. Not such a bad thing actually, if you find a menu item you particularly like. It's my opinion that the oriental chicken salad is good enough to buy extra and take home!  Locals can laugh at the gas they think we waste to go find happy people, but happiness is worth seeking out!

Amar M.,"San Ramon, CA",0,59,,1.0,7/23/2013,"To be fair, my review is closer to 1.5 stars. The food and drink was pretty typical for an Applebee's, meaning it was fine or even pretty good. The problem at this location is the slow service and at times the lack of service. Our server made numerous mistakes.  1) No silverware, napkins, condiments came out with our food. Had to wait for them. Just cause I'm brown doesn't mean I eat with my hands. This seems to be a familiar complaint from the other reviews I've read. 2) Empty glasses sitting on the table forever. I ordered a margarita which was decent, but then I waited for 20 minutes till my server reappeared with our food till I could order another beveraget. I proceeded to order a beer, thinking it would be ready quickly, but had to wait about 15 more minutes for it and didn't get it till I had almost finished my meal. Should have sat at the bar, but tough as I have young children! 3) Server didn't come by even once during dinner to see if we needed anything. 4) After waitress brought out the bill, waited for 15 minutes and nobody came to pick it up. We decided to pay cash and walked out of the restaurant. Not one applebees employee here could muster up a ""thank you"" or ""have a good evening"" to us on the way out. Guess eating good in the neighborhood isn't as friendly as it used to be! Final thing, the food here is super salty. My wife and I both felt swollen and dehydrated the next day, and she didn't have any alcoholic beverages. Pretty crummy feeling! Maybe we got bad service cause we weren't locals. The server asked if we were local or visiting and we told her we were just passing through. Maybe this is why we got such crappy service, but for every action there is a reaction, ergo this crappy review.  My advice would be to eat in Ashland or Eugene, where people are a lot friendlier and more interesting and there seem to be a lot better options than in Roseburg. The stretch from Ashland/Medford to Eugene is probably the most depressing stretch of America that I've visited and this Applebees is a microcosm of why it sucks so bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-roseburg-3?start=80

james c.,"Seaside, OR",8,624,1,4.0,5/6/2016,"This is a good place for late dining if you drive longer than you would like and need a late dinner. This chain is reliably good, not great. Our waitress was friendly and helpful. The wine list is short but there were several decent choices. I didn't want to try one of the interesting cocktails though some if those around us did. My wife had the oriental chicken salad: always a reliable choice.  I tried a chicken dish with lots of vegetables and rice which wasn't great but I didn't want a steak.  If we stay nearby again we will have dinner here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-roseburg-3?start=40

Cody M.,"Roseburg, OR",21,36,19,4.0,4/10/2014,"I'll start off with this, it's Applebee's, a major chain restaurant so not much to input. The food is good for what it is wife always gets three cheese chicken penne, I always get chicken strips cause I think there burgers are mediocre at best. The bar here is great they know drinks and don't gig you on the amount of liquor they give you. It's not a bad restaurant at all just not a big fan off major chain restaurants. Little man is where it's at.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-roseburg-3?start=40

Kevin T.,"Roseburg, OR",1,18,,1.0,4/24/2016,Every time we go here the service is terrible and the food is mediocre at best. The wait time for food has not been under an hour for the past couple of years now for a party of three. Last time we went my kids food didn't even come out until after we were done eating and then it wasn't what she had ordered. The manager reluctantly apologized and offered desert and still charged us for the food my daughter ordered to go at this point.  My suggestions are to work on speed and service as currently the only reason this place stays in business is they are a large chain.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-roseburg-3?start=40
