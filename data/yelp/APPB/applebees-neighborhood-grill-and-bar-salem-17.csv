Sarah K.,"Monmouth, OR",0,8,2,5.0,1/17/2016,"I was extremely impressed when my friends and family all went after church tonight. We descended on Applebee's with over 40 people and they had us all seated within 10 minutes.  The manager was very efficient and had us seated close enough to communicate, though they didn't have the resources to seat us all together. The food was better than I remembered, and despite the chaos we brought the wait staff did an excellent job and remained friendly and helpful. Kudos to you Applebees, we'll try to give you more warning next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-salem-17?start=20
Jill J.,"Salem, OR",0,2,,1.0,8/28/2016,"Started off being quickly seated however the first table suggested was dirty with leftover food still on the table despite the table being set up for a new group. We requested a different table.  Our water and lemonade were quickly delivered, order taken in time, appetizer in time and food also arrived in timely manner. Next came several problems.  We waited FIFTEEN MINUTES for a refill on my daughters lemonade (we had placed the empty glass in plain sight at edge of table) so she had nothing to drink with her food. We pushed the "" call server"" button then waited another 6 minutes before a woman who appeared to be a hostess who stated she had no idea where our server was but that she would let the manager know.  I informed her that we would like boxes to go as well as a lemonade to go since we had not gotten any refill after waiting. We gave the tip to this woman as she was the only one who took the time to check on us after 16 minutes of waiting.  A gentleman from the table seated close to us literally had to get up and walk over to the hostess station to request a glass of water for his wife because they also had been waiting a very long time. ( with their call server light as well on).  Our server just disappeared without even apparently the hostess knowing where he was. As far as the manager being told......we never spoke with a manager and they made no effort to come speak with us. We just got out boxes paid the bill and left.  Being served food then nothing to drink and ignoring customers for 16 minutes even after having the ""call server"" button pushed (on other tables as well) is absolute terrible service in my opinion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-salem-17?start=20

Allison G.,"Salem, OR",35,21,9,1.0,12/26/2013,"I hate coming to this location and now I will never go back.  One, it was freezing in there! I am always hot so the fact that I left my jacket on the whole time shows it must've been COLD.  Two, Our waitress, Deborah D, was horrible. She came to our table to bring us drinks and take our order, and that's pretty much it, someone else brought out our food and refilled our drinks because I told them our waitress vanished. Every, Single, Time, she walked by she made no eye contact whatsoever, had nothing in her hands, and pretty much just ran from one side of the restaurant to the other ignoring us completely. The two times she did actually come to our table she came dancing toward us ridiculously, and didn't even stay long enough to let us accomplish anything.  Three, My food was cold and I was never able to flag her down to tell her, I asked her for mustard and ranch which I never got. I didn't eat a single bite of my food which she didnt even ask about as she dropped the check and left before I could say anything again.  And lastly.... just to add even though its silly... we should've recieved 6cents change back, and she only brought 5cents. Like I said, silly... but the truth. She could've said ""I ran out of pennies or something"" but she didn't. She dropped the receipt and nickle and continued to run around doing NOTHING, but trying to look busy. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.. unless driving to the one off Parkway by Keizer is an option.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-salem-17?start=20
Shelley W.,"Monmouth, OR",32,26,1,4.0,5/26/2014,"Always pleased with this Applebees location. It is clean and service is great. I come to this location often with friends. Tonight I warned the hostess my order might be ""needy"", which I KNOW are words of death to servers and hosts and kitchen alike (I am on a restrictive diet). She let the server know and he promptly came over and took my order (7oz. steak but with extra veggies instead of potatoes, but instead of taking the potatoes out entirely I had them added to my boyfriends order to go). Kudos to Tyler, our server, he waited on us and was great, as well as clean cut. I was by myself and he sat down with me at my table to take my order. It made it feel very personable. My water has been filled three times promptly when it's been emptied, but he knows not to ask questions when our mouths are full. Drink prices are a little high. When we sit in the bar area, I can see the fridge containing the wine bottles and I pay 7.99 for a glass of wine I happen to know is 4.99 for a bottle on the bottom shelf of my grocery store. Price on food is fair. I think 11.99 for steak, potatoes and veggies is pretty good. I do feel the AC is a notch too high but I always feel like that in any Applebees.

First, it wasn't ready on time which is fine except it was SO COLD when I got home (I live about a mile from the restaurant). The cheese was definitely a Kraft single style, BARELY melted!

Normally when I sit in the bar my water never runs dry and I get served fast. I was on a 30min lunch break and got back after 40 mins.

The trio's are excellent as well. I actually don't remember a bad meal there. The service can be a little slow, but in their defense, it is busy most of the time.

Roger T.,"Salem, OR",106,45,129,2.0,8/20/2013,"Middle of the week 6:00pm. Decided that we were hungry enough to eat Applebees! Mistake. We did a togo order from the 2 for 20. I got the rib tips and fries.  Wife got chicken penne noodles. You get to choose a appetizer and a desert also. We went with bonless wings and cheese cake. The waitress was very nice. She made small talk with our kids in the truck. We waited around 30 mins and at first they brought out the wrong order to us. We paid the bill tipped 8bucks and drove off! When we got home found that the ribs were burnt and had very little sauce. My wife said hers was fine. Boneless wings were just soggy and flavorless. (Soggy maybe from togo box, understandable.) And dessert never made it into the bag. Been here several different times and been disapointed a lot. Fustrating. The waitress highlighted several things on our receipt to do a survey. I think before she takes the time to do that she should make sure that all the items have found there way into our bag. I will try my beat to stay clear of this chain.

Erin H.,"Salem, OR",39,934,65,1.0,7/4/2016,"You've got to be kidding me. I was dragged here by a work friend ""to try something new and closer to work"". What an effing joke.  First, the hostess looked miserable. She walked like she was just really tired of the being an executioner; and with what they try to pass off as food here, I feel for her.  Second, even though the place was dead at prime lunch time, it took 10 minutes for the waitress to greet us and bring waters. I looked around and I'm pretty sure I counted more waitstaff than customers. Still, our waitress was MIA the entire lunch and I even had to ""call waitress"" on the table top computer thing just to get our check.  And finally, the menu and food. Look, it's lunch time. Why has Applebee's not created a real lunch menu? Instead of this you have two options: Their full dinner menu at full dinner prices, or their crappy ""mix-n-match"" lunch, which is extremely limited. I had their version of the clubhouse, which came with super sweet BBQ sauce and--no bacon??? It was slapped together with a level of care only possible at Applebee's. I had to dissect and reassemble it. I ""matched"" it with a Caesar salad that came un-tossed and was about 1/2 a handful of lettuce, at best. This with a 1/2 sandwich for $9.

Erika R.,"Salem, OR",124,238,247,4.0,9/24/2015,"My mom and I went to Applebee's to celebrate National Cheeseburger Day and were fortunate to have a great server, Michael J. He was perfect; laid back yet attentive. What I ordered doesn't qualify as a cheeseburger but the photo in the menu was so good, I had to try it: Brew Pub Philly!! Thinly sliced steak with American and craft beer cheese, piled high with batter fried jalapenos, peppers, and onions, all on a ciabatta roll. I could only finish 3/4 of it and I have to say it tasted just as good when I ate the rest at home.  Mom got an All Day Brunch Burger which reminded us both of a back-home favorite in Hawaii, the Loco Moco. It was cheeseburger enough for National Cheeseburger day; a thick ground beef patty with American cheese but with the astonishingly good tastes of fried egg, bacon, onions, hashbrowns and just enough ketchup, it became our new favorite!

Applebee's.  At least that is where you go if you're not from Salem and hungry.  We have been to this particular location twice. The first time was the normal Applebee's experience. Unmemorable.  This time around was probably the best Applebee's experience that I have had in all my Applebee's dining experience, which is something I can count on one hand.  To begin with, it was clear when we arrived that our hostess and waiter seemed to have had a long night. The restaurant wasn't very full when we arrived so we probably just missed a big rush.  I imagine it was just one of those days for them. I get it. I've had those too. Despite this, they were nice and friendly.  The waiter was attentive and we even had the manager stopping by to say hello. That's the first time in my Applebee's dining experience that the manager stopped to do this.  The menu has a variety of food items for whatever you're feeling. Sandwiches. Steak. Chicken. Salad. Whatever. It's Applebee's.  If you expect more than that...well...

Being Summer (or at least that is what the calendar says) I opted for a frozen LEMONADOES drink.  Yes, that is NOT a misspelling...for some reason these chain restaurants try to spell words with cutesy twists.  My partner went tried and true with a Hefeweizen.

How hard is it to fully cook a hamburger that small? I asked for them to make me new ones but get them to go, they were nice and apologetic. When I got my to go bag we left and went home. I was starving so I sat down to eat at home and my little cheeseburger sliders were again, not thoroughly cook. I know I said this in my last review but I won't eat here again even if they pay me. No matter what, I will not be dragged into it again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-salem-17?start=40
Niik I.,"Tualatin, OR",2,35,,1.0,4/27/2012,Day after Halloween trick no treat!!!.9.49 for a plate on nachos with barely any meat or cheese.the only flavoring on these chips was the meat juice. BOO HISS!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-salem-17?start=40
Lily L.,"Salem, OR",41,180,12,2.0,9/15/2011,"SERVER  CASSANDRA was PMS-ING AT ASIANS... at least that's how I felt. Your server thanks a white family for coming in.. then hugs another white person.. helps another white family (while your request get IGNORED,1 refill and 1 shooter both asked at the SAME TIME) and then sees you and frown and has insincere apology. It is upsetting that a refill, just one, the only one we ever asked for comes after 15 minutes and it is wrong, and then 20 mins the shooter comes (half melted)... Those two things a server can prepare, it isnt even the kitchen's fault, if it is the food coming at different times I can understand.  Asians tip bad? If that was what the server thought, well she is stupid.  I am not uneducated nor uncivilized. After her bad treatment I left 10% instead of 18%. The worst part is she has been a server for 8 years! Let me repeat EIGHT (8) years but no customer service skills? Honestly the door holder/opener was a lot nicer. Honestly I go there for the food, but when a bad service affects the food it is an issue. I mean if she is being racist, that's even a bigger issue, and I feel that was it. We were dressed nice but not like in suits, our clothing had no stain or holes, and me and my mom carried a designer purse, its not like we LOOKED like hobos.  why 2 stars? The manager acknowledged the issue when I called him. He gave us a refund which I was surprised since I only called because I felt that treating someone that way was not okay.  ONLY CONCERN: since I will get a refund, I am afraid the waitress might have my address and go revenge on me or something. Remember: worst server: Cassandra best server: Jason",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-salem-17?start=40

Jando S.,"Queens, New York, NY",2562,3288,14346,3.0,2/22/2007,"Applebee's is all over the place in Salem, there are several locations, but none are more needed than this Lancaster location as restaurants are spread out far and apart. While the parking is cramped, it is likely to stay that way all throughout the afternoon all the way into dinner. From a food standpoint, this Applebee's has been fairly decent, although consistent with the rest of its sister chains. Service has always been your average teenager / young adult taking orders and maintaining the service. One should go here before 4PM to take advantage of their half-off appetizers special on weekdays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-salem-17?start=40
