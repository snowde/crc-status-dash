Ashleigh R.,"Queens, United States",64,57,23,3.0,17/10/2017,"It's Applebee's so what should I expect, right?  This location is extremely convenient for me so my husband and I dine here quite often.  We've never had any issues, food is always fine, service is eh, but like I said, it's Applebee's.  Saturday night was a different story.  Our server was new and we could tell he was a little overwhelmed at first, so we let a lot of things slide.  We made the mistake of ordering dessert.  Now it's Saturday night, we're seated in the bar area, we have all of our dirty dishes on our table (not a single one was cleared in the hour+ we were there), people are standing around staring at us because they're waiting for a table meanwhile we're sitting here clearly done with our meal for 30+ minutes.  AWKWARD.  At some point in this 30 minutes, another couple asked if they could sit at our six top table (when we got here, it wasn't AS crowded, but it was the only table available; we wouldn't have sat at a six top otherwise).  So here we are, sitting at our table covered with dirty dishes and now another couple!  You would think that would have gotten our waiter's attention or the fact that we were at a six top that you might want to hurry up and turn over on a busy Saturday night.  NOPE.  We had turned our ""call server"" button on about 15 minutes after ordering dessert, tried to motion for him to come to our table, even went as far as to shout his name.  He walked all around but not once even glanced at us!  We finally had to ask another server if she could please call our waiter over. He finally came over and we asked if he could check on the dessert as it had now been over 30 minutes.  No words, just nods and walks away.  A few minutes later he comes out with the dessert, we say thank you, he then goes off on an uncalled for tangent about some things being out of his control, the kitchen being out of that dessert and having to make it fresh, and loudly stated a few times that ""IT'S NOT MY FAULT, OK!? IT WASN'T MY FAULT.""  OK???  We hadn't even complained since we knew he was new, we just asked him to check on the food since 30 minutes seems like awhile for a dessert.  It wasn't your fault that it took 30+ minutes, we never blamed you for that.  It was however your fault that you didn't bother to come over to our table to see why we were sitting with dirty dishes on our table for 30 minutes after we finished our meal.  Maybe let us know the kitchen is out of what we ordered and there will be a long wait.  Give us some kind of acknowledgement. THAT is your fault.  There was just no need to come at us like we attacked you because we asked you to check on our food. NO. NEED.  If there is one thing I just cannot stand, it is a person who refuses to take responsibility for their actions.  Man up Kyle! Take the words ""it wasn't my fault"" out of your vocabulary. You sound like a crybaby.  But hey, it's Applebee's right? =\",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-san-jose-10?start=40
N K.,"Los Angeles, United States",107,18,1,1.0,9/11/2017,This was my 2nd time here. Host looked bored. Sat at the bar. There were empty plates everywhere and hardly anyone there. Bartender came over about 5 minutes into us being there. Our bartender Amber P. was very slow and a bit rude. She served us our drinks and opened the beer can and it sprayed all over us. She giggled and didn't offer to clean it up Just dropped off a napkin and went on her way. Food was ok. Chicken wonton tacos looked thrown together. I wouldn't come back here,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-san-jose-10?start=40
Victor K.,"San Jose, United States",0,23,6,2.0,27/7/2017,"Decided to visit Applebee's for dinner to try out the new location on Cottle.  We hadn't been to one in several years due to several issues with COLD food, an obvious sigh of pre-prepared/frozen food. I ordered an 8 -ounce sirloin (it looked like tri-tip) and two sides (green beans and Mac-n-cheese).  My wife tried the Mac before I did and said it was cold.  I put my finger in the middle of it and it was probably 40-50 degrees.  The outer portion was warm, a sign of microwaving. I complained on the little tablet they have on the table and my server came over and apologized and offered me a new one.  I refused and had her bring me fries, they were fine.  Not her fault at all. My issue with Applebees is that if they are going to microwave their food from frozen then they need to check the internal temp.  It's improper food prep and can cause illness.  Needs to reach 160 degrees.   See you in another 7 years if you are still in business.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-san-jose-10?start=40
Jo D.,"San Jose, United States",0,4,1,5.0,11/9/2017,"i went yesterday with my girlfriend, her cousin & her girlfriend for some beers and a quick bite. my waitress was ingrid, she was very friendly, funny, and attentive. always made sure to check on our table but not be too overbearing.  i came into this restaurant with an open mind considering all of the negative reviews but every employee i came in contact with were super friendly and helpful. food wait time was not bad either, the average 20-25 minutes. food was also really good, and hot. didn't taste like it had been sitting out. lol but overall i would definitely reccomend to give this location a try and to ignore all of these negative reviews.  big shout out to the employees (including ingrid) who sang happy birthday to me. you were all very enthusiastic. lol",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-san-jose-10?start=40
Damon R.,"San Jose, United States",98,3,,1.0,29/4/2017,"Well, where do I begin. This is the 3rd time visiting the restaurant, trying to give them a chance to work out their service, but I don't think there will be a fourth. Staff is confused, slow and inefficient.  I took my family to the restaurant this evening for dinner. After sitting at a high top table in the bar area, our server took the drink orders. 20 min later, only the water and strawberry lemonade was delivered out of 5 drinks. Two cocktails came back poorly made, while a mystery third cocktail was delivered completely wrong. After asking the server a few times to to get the correct cocktail, we walked to the overwhelmed bar directly to get the drinks remediated. The bartender brings the drinks over, and still tells us that he made them incorrectly. We ordered our entrees (5), however they were all brought out at different times. The first entree, was brought out before even the drinks  were completely. The food runner realized, and returned the food to the kitchen. Entree number 2 (bbq burger) was brought out, however without the sweet potato fries that it was ordered with. Entree 3, salmon, was brought without the sauce. Entree 4, steak, was overcooked and served with cold green beens. Entree 5, well, never appeared with the rest of the orders. After asking the server to bring the sweet potato fries, sauce for the salmon, and the whereabouts of the entree 5, he apologized and came back 5 min later with the sauce...... but it was ice cold.  I had to ask him again to heat the sauce. After the 4 of us finished, they finally bring entree 5. The manager comes by and offers 10% off the bill.....really? After telling her how poor the experience had been, her response was to tell the server more promptly. Really? I felt a bit insulted with the offer. If you decide to try this applebees, try a draft beer and chips, hard to screw that up.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-san-jose-10?start=40
Erica H.,"San Jose, United States",4,9,6,1.0,26/5/2017,"Came in late evening for dinner, and it clearly didn't go as anticipated! It was pretty busy but saw plenty waiters so thought ok, we'll be good!  Well no, the food really lagged on coming out, the grilled chicken looked like cardboard and tasted drier than that!! My daughters grilled chicken was burnt with the matching burnt as hell grill marks. My other daughters chicken tenders were fried to a crisp, like really they looked like chicharrones!! My chicken wrap fell apart upon picking it up. Oh and my salad arrived AFTER my main plate. Ordered a cocktail thinking that would make up for it all but NO! Was horrible and tasted like rubbing alcohol.  Needless to say, everything had juuuust enough wrong to make this meal less than mediocre. Sorry Applebee's, not the least bit impressed. Won't be coming back",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-san-jose-10?start=40
Amber G.,"San Jose, United States",28,13,5,3.0,20/5/2017,"Went to this location for the first time. I ordered off the Lighter side menu, it was good but definitely on the Lighter Side menu for a reason....actual portion size compared to the menu picture was a joke. The steak came in 4 tiny bite-size pieces. The waitress first asked how I wanted the steak done and I said medium, steak came with no pink color and charred on the outside. The waitress also asked how my husband wanted his burger done. He wanted medium, and the burger came showing no sign of pink in the middle :( Why even ask if they don't even get it right?! His fries portion was ridiculous too. Restaurants normally load you up with fries, but here he was able to eat them all and wanted more because he didn't get enough to begin with :( Anyway, Appetizers are awesome here. Love the pretzels and beer cheese dip. Staff is super friendly. Just wish we got the food ordered correctly and bigger quantity. The plates looked half bare before we even touched it.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-san-jose-10?start=40
Henry M.,"Salinas, United States",19,25,3,1.0,2/11/2017,"Me, my wife and my 2 yr son decided to eat here on Sunday. Then my Dad, 2 Sisters, Borther In Law and 4 Kids decide to join as well. We placed our Drinks and Food with the Server. 40 min go by and Food starts arriving. Everyone got there food. Then I notice he forgot my son's food, so I let him know. He didn't put in his order in. So we waited. 20 min later, nothing. So I called the manager and explained what happen and wanted our check cause we are leaving. As we were walking out the door, he comes up and says he was sorry and the our server was super busy. I told him he had to tell my son that and now I have to take my son to eat somewhere else.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-san-jose-10?start=40
Emily L.,"San Jose, United States",20,385,1186,1.0,17/4/2017,"You be the judge of this ""harsh"" review.  I understand that it is grand opening day but the service was terrible  3/14/17 Came in around 10:30 after a movies at oak ridge mall. My party wanted to go to Buffalo Wild Wings for wing Tuesday but I convinced them to come to apple bees for the grand opening  We get here and there's only 2 other parties at the bar. Note, it was pretty warm in the building.  We got seated promptly and was taken drink order. Started off well I would say! 15 mins in and beers start to show up... the wrong beers....  the waiter claims we ordered those beers but we did not. Moving on, we got our beers switched out and everything was good. Next we put in 4 appetizers  and the girls ordered dessert. Thank god we just got appetizers and not a meal. I knew the food was going to take a while, but 40 minutes?!? Considering there was only 3 parties in the entire restaurant.  One of the desserts came out before any of the foods.  Oh and I forgot to mention, by this time it was the 3rd time I asked for a round of iced waters  Everyone was done with their drinks and patiently waiting to get more and our food !!!  I flag down another waiter and politely ask for Ice water again. Nothing...  one last time and the ice water finally comes out!!!  Moving on... the food finally comes out, but with no sauces lol. (Ranch BBQ. You know the typical drill when you order things like mozzarella sticks and celery. ) We all try to just take a breathe and enjoy what we have.  Because it's already been 1 hour 1/2, we wanted to cancel the remaining dessert but apparently it was being made. Ok.... We get done around 1210 and everyone starts to pay. I notice there were things on the bill we didn't even order. Long story short, it took another 20 minutes to get everything sorted out and we finally left at 12:35....  what a night for just a drink and apps.  Will not becoming back for a few months until they get their s**t together.  Will stick to the plant for our weekly applebees trip.  Okay okay. Was I being to harsh? I know it's their first day , but they failed to check up on us. They kept bringing the wrong food to us. Missing things and most importantly, the water!!!!!!  Sorry for the long review, but this rant just had to happen.  4/16/17 Gave this place another try after a terrible experience. Terrible decision. Luckily I was not terribly hungry or angry in anyway. Brought my best friend and arrived around 715 to watch the sharks game. A girl opened the door for us and we were greeted right away. We walked to the bar and sat down. Looked at the menu and ordered both our drinks and food. Also we asked for ice waters. My friends happen to come and join our table so we decided to move to a bigger table. 20 mins passed and no water came out nor did anyone pass by our table to ask if my friends wanted to order anything. I asked our server about 3 times if we can get the sharks game on on the tv by us. 15 minutes the manager in assuming comes out with the remote. I flag her down and asked politely if we could get the sharks game on. Her response, ""what do you want"". She puts the game on and walks away. I flag Jonathan down , not our server but he seemed quick with everything. I asked politely where our stuff was again. He went to the bartender to get our drinks that have been sitting there..... unbelievable. Our food came out 20 minutes later and it wasn't even the right order. Arrrrggggg. I told them we substituted our rice for fries. Also my friend ordered an extra side of rice. It took them another 20 minutes for them to bring it out. 2nd round of drinks I didn't even bother calling our server over. I asked Jonathan directly and he got our drinks in a quickness. If it weren't for Jonathan last night, I would have walked out after my meal. We opted out on dessert because we didn't want to wait ! The portions are so small compared to ""the plant "" location. I left a good tip because Jonathan did his best to make up for the terrible service.  The service still is lacking. I noticed everyone in the restaurant was looking around because they weren't being attended.  The servers need to learn to check up on their tables and not have to wait for us to flag them down and ask for ketchup or a refill on water. Be attentive to the drinks and food that's coming out and not leave it there for it to get cold!  Thank you Jonathan for busting your tail off last night. Your efforts don't go unnoticed! Im forsure asking for you if we ever come back!   Giving this place another 1-2 months before coming back. Hopefully they get their s**t together",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-san-jose-10?start=40
Joshua R.,"San Jose, United States",203,9,6,5.0,22/10/2017,"Kyle was our fantastic server.

Beth E.,"San Jose, United States",8,30,6,5.0,29/4/2017,"We went to Applebees early this week. The waitress didn't come by for 20 minutes. When she finally stopped by to take our drink order, she apologize, saying she was really busy. There was hardly any customers there. Our food came before our drinks. My daughter said her Strawberry Margarita was too strong, so re-made it. She still didn't like it. We asked for it to be taken off our bill. It took 20 minutes for a manager to adjust our bill. We left a 10% tip, which we felt was generous.  A couple of days later, I sent an email in the evening. The very next morning (which was today), the manager, Luis, called to apologize and invited us back to give them one more try on the house. We agreed on tonight. What a different experience. Our waitress, Jasmine, was our waitress until Luis came back from break, and then, he took over. Everything was wonderful and Luis even packed up my leftovers. We gave Jazmine a $20 tip, and we will definitely return. How refreshing it was to find a manager who is passionate of providing good service and food to his customers. We are soon glad we gave this Applebees another chance!!!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-san-jose-10?start=40
Catherine C.,"San Jose, United States",55,21,,1.0,3/5/2017,"This is my second visit to this location and I've only ordered for pick up. NEVER FAILS that something is missing in my order. I had to drive all the way back to get the sauce (which obviously makes the dish) I ordered the salmon with the glaze sauce. The manager was apologetic and even have me a voucher for a free dinner. BUT... tonight it happened again. Sauce?! I'm starting to believe that these are not honest mistakes but the staff needs better training. There was another man in there tonight as I was picking up my order who had complaints about his milkshake being melted and watery. Again, the manager gave him another magical voucher for a free dinner. Why not correct the issue and stop putting a bandage over it.  I'm so done with this location. Unfortunately, we don't have much of a selection working the night shift. I will try and avoid ordering here if I can.

Lani C.,"San Jose, United States",2,4,2,1.0,24/3/2017,"Seemed promising at first based on the level of business tonight. Considering how busy it looked we were seated pretty promptly. Don't think they've worked out all the kinks just yet because we had three different people come and ask us for our order. They need to enforce a grooming policy especially with the servers that handle the food. One of the waitresses/servers seemed like she was high on something and her hands looked filthy, was hoping she was not going to be the person who brings us our food. Beverage order put in first but appetizers came out before drinks (maybe the bar was busy?). Ordered from the 2 for 25 menu.  Drinks: did I just order a virgin Long Island??? Should have just gotten water on the rocks and it would have had the same effect. Appetizer: spinach artichoke dip was lacking from what I've had in the past at other locations, yet was probably the highlight of the night. Don't they just heat this stuff up? Entrees: ordered firecracker shrimp cavatappi and the spinach artichoke chicken cavatappi. Where do I even begin...no flavor at all on either of the pastas! Cue in the burnt chicken, perhaps the most dominant flavor of my dish because I could not get past the taste of overbearing taste of charred. Needless to say we could not get in but a few bites.  Service: first we had three people trying to take our order. Then we had no one checking on us beyond the appetizer. Paid out tab with plates still full and left to fill our bellies up elsewhere.  To summarize, just disappointing all around.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-san-jose-10?start=40

I'm a server too so I understand y'all get busy what c'mon dude, really?  We ordered the salmon with specific instructions, and the server forgot to ring it in... a bigger huh??????  30 mins for an appetizer to come out... HUH????  50 mins for tasteless food(chicken mac n cheese and shrimp cavatappi I believe) was ..... AND the salmon came out raw.  Then I asked for a a manager. 4 times. Took her 15 mins to come out. At this point we really just wanted to leave cause we were just chilling in there for a good 2-3 hours now.

The first time  I visited, I ordered carry out for the boneless buffalo tenders and the lime chicken. The buffalo tenders turned out not to have any buffalo sauce on them, so basically I got chicken nuggets with blue cheese dressing and celery. Oops.  The lime chicken entrée was really tasty. The chicken was cooked correctly and in spite of it being carry out, the rice had good texture and the tortilla strips were all still crispy. I've also been there to dine in and had the crispy chicken and cornbread salad. Basically, it's a chicken salad with squares of cornbread instead of croutons. I really liked it. The cornbread squares were a much better matchup with the fried chicken pieces than croutons would be. It had a great balance of mouth textures and had just the right amount of dressing.  The staff is friendly and the place has a nice layout. In the bar area, there are TVs everywhere so I have a good feeling that you will find me here for Giants games on days I don't have a ticket for the park. #Win",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-san-jose-10?start=20

It's 6:30pm and finished my dinner. I ordered a lemon lime chicken plate that was pretty   but the portion was small for a guy. My daughter had mac and cheese and the wifey ordered Chinese chicken salad which she said was also delicious.

Glen N.,"San Jose, United States",522,1303,1555,4.0,11/3/2017,"Reportedly one of only two bars in a three mile radius, fitting because it feels more like a cool vegas sports bar with a restaurant than a restaurant with a bar, which is why  I gave this place four stars.  Upbeat background music, dimly lit, with bold but muted color lamps, digital menus on the wall, liquor on display, and a dozen huge flat screens TVs. And it is mullet free. The food is typical of any ""Thank Outback it's Chili's"" type of food.  The brunch burger was not as awesome as I imagined because the hash browns aren't crispy, but it's a hearty burger.  The french fries are seasoned, but very salty, so if you are salt-sensitive, ask for unsalted.  The thin chocolate shake is good, though my server kept think I said taco shake, which is probably not as good.  The chicken wonton tacos appetizer are yum, especially when you squeeze on the fresh lime.  I'd get them again, because I am wonton more.  Get it?",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-san-jose-10?start=20

Motakitty ..,"San Jose, United States",0,2,,1.0,5/12/2017,"This place is terrible. We've been here twice and the first time the waitress put her fingers in wife's drink and got her another one but still charged us for two drinks. Didn't notice that till I got hone and wondered my the bill was so much. The manager gave us a credit, fine. But the next two times we've gona the food takes forever to come out. There's like five or six different people serving us so we have no clue who to ask for things. None of them come back to refill our drinks( that's a big thing in my eyes). The food is just ok but not for the cost and the waste of my time. I get better service at McDonald's. I think I've learned my lesson and won't ever go back to this one.

The food was just ok.  Nothing special, nothing memorable.  The service was good and friendly.  The great service cannot not make up for the rest.  I was just happy to get out of there and have a normal tome of conversation.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-san-jose-10?start=20

Our food didn't come out at the same time so my brother was sitting there for almost 30 minutes with nothing to eat while the rest of us finished our meals. My grandma ordered off the 2 for $22 section and her chicken was completely burnt and half her plate was covered with potatoes. She then asked for something new and didn't get it until 25 minutes later after we reminded the waitress. When the waitress brought out her plate, the food was incorrect so the manager had to come out and help fix everything... Not once did our original waitress, Adrianna, apologize for the inconvenience or check up on us. She avoided our table everytime she walked by. My grandma had to go to the bar and refill up her own drink because no one bothered to ask us if we needed anything. She also had to find the manager to inform him that our bill was overcharged. Overall, I am very dissatisfied with this location and will not be back unless Johnathan is my waiter. He was extremely nice and made my entire family laugh so much.

On top of that, I asked for my steak to be medium rare and it was well done. I don't know who the chef is, but there food is unacceptable. I told the waiter to let the chef know that the meal was inadequate. I've never told a server to tell their chef that the food was horrible before.

Kevin B.,"San Jose, United States",218,1,,4.0,14/3/2017,"Today marks the Grand Opening of this Cottle/VIO location for Applebees which is located right at the corner across from Starbucks. Ive read they recently had a soft opening but doing research that they had finally opened to the public on 3/14/17 I decided to give it a try with my sister since it was close to home.  SERVICE: Being that it was the grand opening, service was great from opening the door for us, being greeted by the host and seated right away, everyone was on their A-game. Our host was kind enough to makes us feel welcomed about what to expect and who would be our server. Our server is named Shontelle, she did a great job overall not only taking our orders, but also having time to small talk as she eases the same time doing her job. There were a lot of servers going around, as I'm sure a lot of trainees, about 3 different servers checked up on us including the manager herself to give time to know about our reasons to visiting and assuring everything is going smoothly. FOOD: Me and my sister ordered the 2 for $25 Deal which included an appetizer and two entrees. -Crunchy Onion Rings (Appetizer) -Firecracker Shrimp Cavitti which was slightly smothered in Sriracha base. (Entree) -Spinach and Artichoke Chicken Cavitti pasta We were then reminded by the manager of a list of apps that were half off at the time being there. So we included  -Chicken Wonton Tacos *qty 4*  Everything tasted great and our food came out quick. For it being this great from the service and food, I can only hope they can be consistent as time goes on, so I'm glad to enjoy the grand opening to have a full service experience to be on top.

John G.,"San Jose, United States",2,38,,2.0,5/9/2017,"We recently ate here because it was not terribly busy, had air conditioning, and was good for kids. The food was, you know, Applebee's. HOWEVER, there were gigantic $6 craft beers on tap (happy hour, I guess), which is something that I wish I could get everywhere. Like at the post office, or at Target. The only thing that marred the experience was that apparently someone was having an off night. Out of the six or so surrounding tables in the short time we were there, two parties requested to talk to the manager and two different parties had items comped or removed from their bill (yes, we could overhear all this). That is pretty astonishing. I chalked it up to bad luck, but then I tried to pay my bill with the dumb table-tablet thingy, and it refused to process the charge because it insisted that water must first be added to my bill (maybe it thought we were dehydrated?). Being a more-or-less all-around dumbass, I had to go and try it twice before flagging down the waitress. So of course now I have three separate $60 charges on my debit card.  Two of them are in the process of being reversed, so that's going to work out eventually.  However, there is an item on my e-mailed receipt that I did not notice at the restaurant (the screen font is pretty small), and that's a $7 brownie that we neither wanted nor ordered nor received.

We were told that we could order food and appetizers from the kiosk on the table but it did not work. We had to wait another 15-20 minutes for our server to come back to take our order (the restaurant was not busy at all). When we finally got our order most of the items were wrong and when we told the person who brought us our food if we could get the ordered corrected she roller her eyes and walked away to get our waiter. Over all the experience at this Applebee's was less than satisfactory and extremely unprofessional.

Gracie L.,"San Jose, United States",33,1,,1.0,30/3/2017,"Our first visit to this location: My husband and I were seated after about 10 minutes of waiting in the reception area. Server #1 took our orders as soon as we were ready and was able to serve us our drinks after about 15 minutes. Said server informed us our appetizer would be ready in about 8 to 10 minutes. After about 30 minutes of waiting for our appetizer, server #2 informed us that server #1 went to his lunch break and that she would take care of our orders.  At this point, we were ok waiting because we were watching a basketball game. But after another 15 minutes and no updates whatsoever from any one of the servers, I began to wonder what's going on with our orders.  We were still sitting there without any food on our table when server #1 came back from his lunchbreak. I saw the look on his face when he saw us. He was surprised to see that we were still sitting there and haven't gotten any of our food! By this time I told him to just cancel all the orders and we'd rather leave.  But he apologized and talked to his manager and told us that the appetizer would be ready in 10 to 15 minutes at no charge. So we decided to wait since it's free! And told him that we want it in a to-go box since it's getting really late and I was starting to feel sleepy. As for my entree, I have ordered their Cedar Salmon.  Server #1 informed me that they ran out of salmon and that our orders were just sitting there in the back and somebody had forgotten to prepare any of them that's why there was a 1 hour and 30 minutes delay. I was given the option to change my order to something else but was told it's going to take another 30 minutes. Are you kidding me?!? I didn't even know at this point if I should trust the server or not, since he initially told us to wait 8-10 minutes for our appetizer that took 1 hour and 45 minutes to be ready. In addition to this, My husband's order never came out.  And then finally server #3 got our free appetizer ready but it was served in a plate. I specifically told server #1 that I want it in a to-go box. And so server #3 grabbed the plate and went back to the kitchen. Server #1 came up to our table and started apologizing again saying that they won't be able to provide our free appetizer anymore and that the manager did not allow it. My husband and I looked at each other really confused. We explained to server #1 that server#3 handed us the appetizer already, and that we just had her put it in a to-go box. And server #1 said, ""oh, then they did listen to me!""   Obviously, there seemed to be a lot of miscommunication going on and I think the employees need to be trained more.  They need to improve and work on A LOT of stuff! 3 servers were helping us and yet we had to wait that long to get our food ready. Not even all the orders. just the appetizer. Unacceptable. And I am not the most impatient person I know.  The two customers who came in a few minutes after us who were sitting right next to our table had the same issue with their orders and decided to leave the restaurant with nothing. Not even a complimentary gift card from the manager. I feel sorry for them. They waited almost the same time we did and only got their drinks. I give Applebee's one star for not charging for our appetizer.

Kristina N.,"Milpitas, United States",73,126,142,4.0,13/3/2017,"Got invited as part of their soft opening since I work in the neighborhood on Sunday. To be honest when I saw that they were building an Applebee, I was like ""why?"" I am not a fan of this chain restaurant, one being the service is just horrible & that goes for staffs & managers. Second the food is way below average, everytime I come to any of the Applebee's locations I never end up finishing my food. But hey since it was free and it's literally a 1 minute walk from my house I decided why not. The interior of the restaurant was super nice, new ofcourse, looks huge but since I didn't walk around i'm not quite sure of how big it is. It's nice to have a bar within the 10 mile radius though. Anyways the staffs were very welcoming & attentive. Its always like that in the beginning of course but I pray it won't change with this location. Our server was on top of her game, was a server at lots of high dining restaurant before so I know how it is. Anyways, lets go straight to the food. We ordered cheese sticks for appetizers and its so much better than Red Robin. My boyfriend ordered the new whisky bacon burger while I had the shrimp stir fry (not sure of the name) it came with white rice, wontop strips, broccoli and red pepper i believed. My son had the mac & chz with chicken & mashed potatoes. My boyfriend described his burger as ""super juicy"" he got it done ""pink."" He put bbq in it as well and said its actually the best thing he've ever tried at Applebees. The burger itself was quite big & my bf can easily eat a half pound burger with fries but he couldn't even finish this burger. Moving onto my food, I like it! It was different, but delicious. The only cons I have about it was I was debating whether to get that or the thai shrimp salad and i saw how the salad was a ""lighter fare"" so i went with this one cause I wanted a bigger portion but when the dish came out it was literally so little.. the rice were literally 1/4 of a cup, all spreaded out on the plate to make it look like it's a lot.  I was a little disappointed as to how small the portion is, I don't eat a lot and i was still hungry after finishing my plate. I didn't try my son's food but the portion for a kid's meal was pretty huge. All the plates' presentations was on point. The blue moon was super fresh & the strawberry shake was one of the best shakes I've ever had. So kudos for that. Overall the experience was surprisingly amazing.

Keesha is super friendly and takes care of you ensuring your order is correct. Jonathan has an awesome personality that's welcoming and warm. The only thing I'd suggest is to keep someone in the area since it's on the side of the place next to the kitchen and most of the staff are too busy to acknowledge your presence.

The grilled veges unfortunately we're not cooked and cold.  Darn it, but just had to laugh at the whole thing.   The manager and waitress were very friendly, helpful and apologetic about the whole thing and yes they took the error off the meal.  My son's meal he stated was good.  I think we will wait a few more months until they iron out the kinks and give em another try.

Our food server got things mixed up with his wording and my husband ate my dinner thinking it was his. Then the Manager had to come and straighten things out, but we felt like the server should have handled it.

I honestly don't expect much of these places, but I was still excited when they opened because there's not much in the way of sit-down restaurants in this area. First went here about a month after they opened. Food was mediocre, service was terrible, long wait for a table and the restaurant wasn't even half-full, and we couldn't even get water refills. Checked Yelp and noticed the horrible reviews, but I let it go because they were new.  Fast forward to this past Sunday. Decided to give them another shot, but this time I ordered online to avoid the crap service inside. Food-to-go is hard to f up. Right? Wrong! When I went there to pick up, I was informed that none of the entrees I ordered were available. And then they tried to give me somebody else's order! I asked them to cancel my order and the manager actually got snippy with me.   Avoid this place at all costs.

Audrey S.,"San Jose, United States",75,17,3,2.0,23/5/2017,"We took the family here tonight for dinner and we were sorely disappointed. I mean, it's Applebee's so we were not expecting a Michelin star experience. We were seated and given menus.....half of which were in Spanish. So we shared menus and didn't give it a second thought. I ordered a captain and Diet Coke. Hey, bathing suit season is here. The waiter seemed genuinely confused by my order. I told him I could see the captain Morgan's behind the bar and he seemed relieved. My husband ordered a margarita. We were ready to order our food and placed our orders along with our drinks. Then the wait begun. It was at least 20 minutes before the cocktails came out and we quickly realized my husband's drink order was wrong. We pointed it out to the girl who brought the drinks before the glass was on the table. Because his drink was obviously wrong, I asked if my drink was made with Diet Coke. This was the only special request that was made in our order for four people. She responded by saying that she didn't know because she was only bringing out the drinks. She seemed put out that my husband asked for his drink to be corrected. Our meals came out right after our drinks....before our appetizer which we never received. The food was good, tasty and filling. Another lady brought out the food and she was really nice and friendly.   We did a ""cheers"" with the kids and my youngest clinked her glass too hard and spilled a bit. Not a full tip over but more of a slosh over. 2 servers walked by our table and watched us try to clean this up with our cocktail napkins with no offer of additional napkins or assistance. I asked the third person for extra napkins.    All over the kids menus were notices that kids meals we $1 with paid adult meal on Tuesdays which was a nice surprise. We did not know that going in so were happy to learn that. But when the bill came, the kids meals were full price.    Overall, this place needs to get it together.

When we asked a manager why it took 45 minutes for a salad to come out, he responded that the servers made them! Seriously? How can they serve their tables and make salads? And honestly it's a little disgusting. The management is the back bone and obviously they need to restructure! It takes too long and the servers just hang around. Watch your bill also- they want you to pay from your table and when we checked the screen they had changed us for 2 meals we didn't order.

Aj S.,"Campbell, United States",30,1,,5.0,27/3/2017,"This Apple Bee's just opened up 2 weeks ago Walking in i was greeted with a warm welcoming from the door person ""Hi, Welcome to Apple Bee's"". I asked for a Bar seat, they said ""Theres no wait open seating at the Bar"" Awesome a local Bar i can just walk into with good food and a wide variety of drinks and food on the happy hour menu from mixed drinks, to beer, wine, and a nice selection of snacks and meals Upon entering the middle Dining room/Bar everything looks clean and brand new complete with a digital menu on the wall, game pads on the dining tables and numerous TV's. I took a seat at the Bar the very friendly staff immediately greeted me and got me a menu and some water. Having not been to Apple Bee's for my first time in years I asked for some ideas on popular appetizers and staff favorites. My Bartender/Server Hayden was incredibly helpful making a few suggestions of Customer Favorites and his own personal choices. I ended up ordering the Cedar Lemon Chicken and in only a matter of 10 mins or so i was served. The Chicken tasted savory and was nicely cooked with quinoa and rice on the side complimenting the sweet apple relish a top the juicy Lemon Chicken flavor for a Deliously tasty, chewy, sweet and savory combination. After finishing my meal i started engaging in a conversation with another person at the Bar introducing ourselves and making some small talk about the rain he offered me a Beer. Me not knowing what was on tap i asked my Bartender Hayden what they had he ran down the list I told him i prefer IPA's and he strongly recommended i give the Space Dust by Elysian a try. I couldn't be happier a strong hoppy taste and aroma with a smooth finish, Awesome Beer! Overall I enjoyed my experience at the Bar. It had a great Atmosphere, 6 or more Games on multiple TV's through out the room and other dining areasl, an all around awesome staff, comfortable seats, nicely priced happy hour menu, and friendly customers. I will definitely be coming back here soon.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-san-jose-10?start=140

Alejandra P.,"San Jose, United States",30,2,,1.0,21/3/2017,"I know it has been only a week, but I had to leave a review. I try not to leave reviews as I do work in customer service and know that working in the restaurant business is also difficult. But tonight I had some of the worst experience I have had at a restaurant in a very very long time. My boyfriend son and I went in to give it a try. We walked in around seven in the evening, excited to try our new neighborhood Applebee's. The hostess told us it was a 20 min wait to be seated. I was thinking alright it's not a wait at all. We got seated in less then 20 min and waitress came by. She came by asked us what we would like to drink and if we would like any appetizers. Unfortunately our waitress came back and told us that they were out of our drinks that we had ordered. Totally fine, we understood so my boyfriend ordered a frozen lemonade, and I ordered a raspberry iced tea.... seems pretty simple right?  So we thought..... we also ordered mozzarella sticks as an appetizer. The waitress came and told us, she working on getting our entrees out. First all we hadn't even ordered our food, she had just taken our drinks and appetizer. 15 min pass by and she brings my son's milk. Five min pass by and they bring out our appetizer. Still no drinks at this point, just the milk. We finish the appetizer still no drinks or even the waitress to come by to take our order for the entree.  She walked past us several times and we tried getting her attention and she just continued walking. At this point my five year old was getting restless, and my boyfriend was getting aggravated. Finally after waiting another 30 min..... NOTHING!  I finally got up and just asked for our tab, I didn't want to leave with out paying for our two items that we had received. Our waitress brings us our check, and wanted to charge us for items that we never even received, I told her I was only going to pay for the items we did receive.  Another 15 min later she comes back and says that  her manager voided the whole bill. Not that it was much. No more then 10$ but then she said out appetizer was ready and she could pack it to go, not even bothering to see that we had already received them.  We probably would have stayed if she would have communicated with us like she had with the drinks, and had even bothered to take the rest of our order. Would it have been faster for us if we ordered through the tablet on the table?? Needless to say we won't be going back unless someone we know goes and has a good experience. Communication is key, and will keep your customers coming back, wether you're busy or not. Worst experience in a very very long time. Thank god Mod Pizza was next door because we were very hungry by the time we had left!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-san-jose-10?start=140

She located my server and they were surprised my meal never came out. After looking into it, he discovered my meal was given to someone else. My family was all done eating so we told him to cancel my order and we left. The second time, the service was fine. The food was alright. We decided to give it another shot tonight. After being seated, we waited about 15 minutes and couldn't get anyone to acknowledge us. No drink order or even a simple hello. We decided to leave. When walking out, my wife let the host know that we couldn't get service so we choose to leave. After walking across the street, an Applebee's employee yelled out the door ""very class A**hole. We were confused and talked to two very nice ladies that had just walked out. They didn't appreciate the employee's remarks given they with with a young girl. One of them went into complain. They other explained their husbands were already in complaining about their very poor service at the time. I went in to speak to a manager and he said he would discipline the employee but I'm sure nothing will be done.

Christian B.,"Pacifica, United States",2,3,,1.0,23/3/2017,"Stop! Turn around!! I brought my wife and kids here for dinner and it was a nightmare!!! This was the worst Applebee's that I've ever experienced. If you get Sam the waitress, leave now!! We walked in around 6pm and got seated right away in her section. She came and took our drink and appetizer order (2 sodas and a child's milk, spinach artichoke dip). When she came back, she only brought 1 soda with her and took our entree order. About 20 minutes later, we finally got our other 2 beverages. Another person brought us our appetizers. Sam never came back to check on us. An hour passes and I notice that the 4 other tables around us (all who came and were seated after us) and all gotten their appetizers and entrees before us. We asked another worker to check on our food for us (since Sam was no where to be found) and eventually the manager came out to speak with us. The manager, Louis, was apologetic and asked us what we ordered. We told the manager what we ordered, and he went back to the kitchen to check on our order. He came back with my sons food (a grilled cheese sandwich and some fries). Then he told us that Sam NEVER ENTERED OUR ORDER INTO THE COMPUTER SYSTEM!!! Are you kidding me?? I have been sitting here for over an hour, waiting for our food and hoping to leave the restaurant before my kids go crazy and the waitress never even entered our order??!!?? Louis was apologetic but at that point I couldn't wait in the restaurant any longer. Although Louis tried to right the wrong, there is no way that I would bring my family back here.  They tried to fit in as many tables as they could to maximize their seating capacity...it became extremely uncomfortable when another family sat behind us. My wife (who is quite petite) was pressed against the table when another averaged sized person sat in the chair behind her.

My husband had to tell the person who was seating people that we were here first before the older couple and the other couple who came much later. I don't even think the guy read the paper which people wrote down who was next.

Anthony R.,"San Jose, United States",87,4,6,1.0,21/3/2017,"What happened Applebees?!! I stopped going to Applebee's a few years ago because I was very disappointed in the food and service. I gave it another chance a few years later when the one at the Plant opened up and I was very very impressed with the food and service and so went back a few times and they held true. Today we tried this one because we were local and hungry. Wow, what a disappointment! First off all, the side door had an ADA sticker, but didn't have the proper equipment to meet the requirements, strike 1. The waiting room was really tiny making it really uncomfortable for anyone with a wheelchair or a baby stroller, not to mention that the wait was about 30mins to get seated. But alright, I get it. It's a Tuesday night for dinner. So we get seated finally. We make our order. Here's where the stars fall. A waiter dropped something and started yelling some vulgarity. A lot of customers got quiet and became a bit uneasy but eventually shook it off. And then the wait. Although we ordered our spinach and chips to get there before our meal, it came with our meal. The dip was cold, the cheese was hardened, and some of the chips were stuck together, not to mention the ones that were not clumped were bland, over salty and had a bitter after taste. Did I mention it was cold? I ordered some sirloin over grains something, medium cooked. The flavor was mediocre, but the sirloin was closer to well done and cold and the grains had a good flavor but was cold. My wife ordered another well done steak with shrimp. Once again, the flavor was there but was cold and very tough, not what I'd expect from Applebee's. At least it was cooked to the right color. The kids' chicken strips and fries were warm. Even though my son ate most of his corn dog, but it was pretty plain. The chocolate milk was pathetic and not fully mixed. I mean, come on! Chocolate milk?! Really? We were pretty much discouraged to order dessert and that actually speaks a lot. Our waiter was nice, but was too distracted to give us the attention I'd usually expect. Not to say I'd want it, but it just didn't feel the friendliness. I also mentioned the cold food to our waitress and she said she'd talk to the manager about our dissatisfaction, but I don't think it ever happened.

At least we actually did all get what we ordered, but half of the entrees were cold, including my son's chicken nuggets and fries! My daughter's kid steak was supposed to be medium but instead it was very well done and quite chewy. My older son had their burger and fries. It was underwhelming and he didn't care for it. I had a chicken dish and while I didn't love all of it, the chicken itself was quite flavorful, juicy and the right temperature.

Probably the only experienced server there.  My whisky burger finally comes out wrong so I ask my server who then grabs my fork and digs around my burger right in front of me at the table I was looking pretty shocked at this moment as was my gf.  When she's done she says oh yea it doesn't have the onions so comes back in another 10 min with a little bit of fried onion strings.  Whatever this burger looked nothing like the picture and was so dry I was thinking about asking for water to dip it into.   Our server was sweet but generally inexperienced and overwhelmed.

Food is pathetic - does not taste fresh no matter what you order. It is served below the average temperature, i think that's what makes it even worse. Soda glass is filled with ice and and only 1/5 of the drink is actually soda. Plus they charge for refills. It sucks that the waitresses seem to be trying but still not getting it right. After 1st visit which was terrible (it took them 1.5 hrs to bring the order, plus they brought appetizer after dinner was served), we had decided to give them benefit of doubt since they had just opened, so i walked in with a friend for drinks for a 2nd visit. They did not seem to get the same drink she had ordered a day ago right, and took forever to take the order and the payment even from the bar. We thought if not for the food, we could go there for the bar. But they failed to live up to that as well. If they can at least have fresh appetizers and drinks, they could get my good reviews. Everyone i know in the neighborhood have had similar, poor experiences on different occasions. Lets just hope they live up to the expectations, because as of right now they are scrambling to get it together.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-san-jose-10?start=160
Mike P.,"San Ramon, United States",1,33,1,5.0,21/3/2017,"Hey it's brand new! Cool looking place, food is edible, staff are trying hard and they have nice TVs. Good choice of beers and liquor. Support your local bar! You don't have a lot of choice so let's patronage and make it better.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-san-jose-10?start=160
Davida R.,"San Jose, United States",0,6,,1.0,16/3/2017,If I could give zero stars I would. I understand they've only been open a couple of days but this was the absolutely worst experience. We arrive before 5:00 so not a rush hour. After we were seated it took at least 15 minutes for them to figure out who our server would be. Server wasn't familiar with the menu but OK just opened. Took our order. 15 minutes later we got our beverages. Our house salad did not come for another 20 minutes or so. Finally our meal comes. I take a bite of the mashed sweet potatoes and they are ice cold. I mean as just out of the refrigerator cold. On top is a ball of butter that hasn't melted. Because it just came out of the refrigerator. Everything else was luke warm. Including my husbands food. Called a server over and asked for the manager. Finally she comes over. NEVER in all of my 64 years have I walked out of a restaurant. But that's how bad this place is. And the topper is as I was walking out of the women's room in walks a male worker who says don't worry just checking the bathroom. Hello? Aren't you supposed to announce yourself. Skip going to the Applebee's on Cottle. Just horrible,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-san-jose-10?start=160
Nikki D.,"San Jose, United States",0,4,,1.0,15/5/2017,"Horrible costumer service! First things first my daughter needed a refill and I ask the women walking that so happened to be the manager (Angela)  if she could please get her a refill she rolled her eyes and said what is this. Second My burger was made incorrectly and didn't come with everything that was listed. I told my waiter and he informed me he'd get a side of the bacon etc that was missing which was okay after 30 minutes of waiting and still no bacon or the hash browns. I didn't even want the burger anymore, who would want a cold burger and hot bacon and hash browns gross!! I simply told the manager (Angela)I'd like to return it she asked ""Why"" Informed her what was going on her response was I was wrong and that it doesn't come with bacon when it clearly states on the menu it does, she then rolled her eyes and says okay very rudely take the plate and doesn't ask can I get you anything else or apologize. As a manger you have to be a people person she clearly doesn't want to be bothered and doesn't care about customer satisfaction. This Applebee's barely opened and horrible management team! Will not be coming back after this Experience.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-san-jose-10?start=180
Lorraine J.,"San Jose, United States",0,18,,1.0,5/7/2017,"Went to Applebee's tonight on Cottle Road, around 5:30 p.m.for dinner.  I was surprised to see it was not as crowded as it once was and I was very disappointed, so much so that we walked out. The music blasting out of their speakers was absolutely horrible and very loud. The loud beat with some screeching singer, over and over and over and over.  I asked to speak to the manager who never came, but they delivered my message to her. Waited and waited for the manager, Angela, to take care of it (so they said) .  All we had ordered so far, was our drinks which came but which we didn't touch.  I told them I was going to wait to order until they did something about the music.  Nothing ever happened, so we left our drinks and walked out.  One of the workers thanked me for saying something about the music (they didn't like it either) but where Angela went as she was eating some ice cream, who knows? Obviously, the workers there are either tone deaf, block it out, or are zombies. Left and went to Betto's in Morgan Hill, which is ALWAYS fabulous!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-san-jose-10?start=180
Zalinka H.,"San Jose, United States",0,9,,2.0,29/5/2017,"I really wanted this Applebees to work out because it's food and alcohol in a nice setting and it is open until midnight but every time I go here something is wrong. The first time I went there the drinks were great and the food took a while to come out and it was okay except I had ordered some ribs but they were so overcooked that I had a hard time taking the meat off of the bone, my friend said something and I got new ribs and they were awesome so I figured it was just a mistake. Next time I went there it was just my boyfriend and I and we ordered food and two drinks, both margaritas. The food come out pretty quickly but our drinks took more than 45 minutes and then my margarita tasted like just water, I would have said something but they took it off of the bill so I just shared my boyfriends drink. The next time I went there it was with a group of friends, we all mostly got appetizers, the drinks (nonalcoholic) took about ten minutes and the food took more than 50 minutes.. for some quesadillas! It makes me sad because you can see that the waiters are really sorry and they kept coming back to us to check up on us and trying to reassure us that the food was coming. I just hope that it can get a grip on how to manage traffic and not keep customers waiting.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-san-jose-10?start=180
Mathew C.,"San Jose, United States",0,5,,1.0,17/3/2017,"First of all, the appetizers were the most expensive appetizers I have ever seen. They were also not very good and were small for their incredibly huge prices. The meals I ordered were incredibly dry and flavorless. The sirloin and whole grains tasted like actual dirt. The bone in wings were way over cooked. The Nashville hot chicken sandwich is just a mess. It's extremely dry and hardly sauced. The sauce that is there is very bland. They were also way overstaffed. They had 15 employees standing in the back at one time, and those weren't all of them. The rest were walking around or hanging out at the front. There must have been at least 30 people working there, however service was still slow. They weren't on top of drinks somehow (30+ people were doing nothing) and it took 5 whole minutes for them to bring ketchup and ranch. No one ever gave us our check even 10 minutes after we were done eating. We finally decided to use the table side tablet to pay as our waitress stood in the back doing nothing. Overall it's extremely expensive and not good at all.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-san-jose-10?start=180
