Jaimie K.,"Des Moines, IA",11,55,170,5.0,11/26/2017,Was just passing through and saw a familiar restaurant to stop at. It's very clean and like all the usual Applebee's they have local pictures and decorations from the area. Service was amazing. The food came out almost as soon as it was ordered. The waitress Bailee was so very down to earth and nice. She was on everything. Never had to ask for anything. Clean bathrooms and clean dining area.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sedalia-3
Brenda D.,"Weston, MO",80,626,5,3.0,10/14/2016,"First of all, it was freezing in the restaurant!  Service was just ok.  Applebees has stepped up their food selection since I've been to one.  Food was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sedalia-3
Angela E.,"Norfolk, VA",74,35,15,2.0,4/22/2016,"Server was as nice as could be but slooooow. Slow to get a beer (had to ask twice), slow for food to come and never did get sour cream I asked for. Food was good. Server was nice but very, very slow. Over an hour for beer and appetizers is a little much!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sedalia-3
Joe W.,"Sedalia, MO",0,5,1,2.0,11/11/2015,"went to hometown Applebee's for the ""veterans day free meal"" wife and I both ordered the American burger, I had sweet potato fries, wife had onion rings  we both had flavored ice tea. they charged .99 cents more for my fries which were cold and hard, $1.79 more for onion rings and $2.69 each for the weak ice tea plus .59 cents each for flavored, that is over $6.50 for 2 ice teas with no refills. the bill come to almost $21.00 with my ""free meal"" all that was free was the burger. should have gone to Golden Corral for veterans day. will not be returning to this Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sedalia-3

Claudia S.,"Overland Park, KS",85,814,172,1.0,11/9/2012,"Me: ""Is there Happy Hour tonight?"" Him: ""I don't think that starts until November."" Me: ""It is November."" Him: ""Oh, I don't know. Do you want something to drink?"" Me: ""The drink menu doesn't have prices. How much are the drinks?"" Him: ""I don't know the prices, I have to put your order in before I see the prices. Which drink do you want?"" Me: ""I don't know what I want until I know the prices."" Him: ""Like I said, I'd have to look up the prices for you in the computer."" Me: ""Grunt and growl, bub. Otherwise, I gotta go."" Mom: ""It must be his first night."" Friend: ""Um, no, he was our waiter two weeks ago."" Lame, Applebees. So lame. And, your drinks are nasty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sedalia-3
Lacy H.,"Wellington, MO",52,3,3,4.0,7/6/2015,"My husband wanted to have dinner at Applebee's on the way down to the lake.  I'd read several bad reviews of this location so I was reluctant but I did see that they just recently got a new manager so I agreed.  Besides, I do love Applebee's Perfect Margarita...a couple of those and I don't care about the food!   Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised!  The waiter was attentive and polite.  They have several new appetizers so we tried the Beer Cheese Dip with Pretzels.  It was very good and the Sriracha Shrimp was awesome!   He had a steak with shrimp which he said was cooked very perfectly.   I had a chicken cheese penne pasta...it was a bit bland but it is a chain restaurant so that's fine.  The manager did come over and asked how everything was!  I've never seen that at any Applebee's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sedalia-3
Alicia B.,"Riverhead, NY",53,61,31,2.0,3/23/2015,"I really wanted to like it here that I came twice before I wrote a review. I normally love Applebee's. The waitress was grumpy and my food was wrong twice. They did discount my food and management and the hostess were very nice. I was just disappointed with the service and quality. The first time I visited I was over charged, but ignored it and left anyway.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sedalia-3
Nadia S.,"Richmond Heights, Saint Louis, MO",0,35,15,5.0,5/22/2015,They have a new manager and the service is sooo much better. I believe his name is Jeremiah (sorry if misspelled it). Loved the food and the services they provided.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sedalia-3
Chelsie F.,"Spanaway, WA",0,2,,1.0,5/1/2015,"The worst Apple Bee's I've ever been to! The manager was rude, it took apart ten minutes for someone to just get our drinks and overall just wasn't a welcoming atmosphere! Will not be coming back. I'd rather drive to Warrensburg's Apple Bee's. If I could rate this zero I would! Also it was a hot day 79 degrees and there was no AC it was extremely hot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sedalia-3
Jennifer C.,"Sedalia, MO",0,1,,1.0,12/4/2013,"Went in with my husband, the waitress didn't seem interested in our table, food wasn't that great either. We don't plan on returning again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sedalia-3
Lee S.,"Electric City, WA",34,141,15,1.0,7/6/2012,The food tasted reheated in the worst way and the service was poor. We waited forever for a server that gave disinterested service at best. Do not recommend.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sedalia-3
Shawn H.,"Kansas City, MO",64,290,32,2.0,4/24/2009,It's a chain restaurant with mostly microwaved food.  One time they actually forgot to remove my green beans from the plastic bag they were microwaved in.  The food is banal.  The environment loud.  I can get a beer anywhere.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sedalia-3
