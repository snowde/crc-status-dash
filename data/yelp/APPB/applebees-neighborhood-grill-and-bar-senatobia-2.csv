Jordan S.,"Senatobia, MS",52,38,9,3.0,12/10/2017,"It was good, not great - no bad. Having given this Applebee's a year or so, i feel that the issues that once plagued it are for the most part gone now. Will return again for the full experience and an updated review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-senatobia-2
Martha M.,"Coldwater, MS",0,29,,1.0,9/14/2017,"Don't  bother - you place an order but don't get to eat!  Two of us got our food but my daughter never got her dinner.  Our server never explained - it felt like she was hiding from us.  We only knew that there was a problem because we overheard another server tell someone they gave part of an order to the wrong table.  We finished our meal and waited 20 minutes for the missing entree to be recooked.  We finally just canceled the missing food and left with a hungry child.  We had to wait yet  another 10 minutes for the manager to figure out how to take the missing food off the ticket.   Seriously?   This is how NOT to run a restaurant!!   If you still want to go here, take your bug spray.  We kept swatting mosquitoes the whole time we were there.  At least some got to eat!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-senatobia-2
Rikki T.,"Norfolk, VA",2,81,14,1.0,1/30/2017,"Visited about 7pm for dinner and was kindly served by Whitney.  Sweet tea that we ordered was unsweetened, the chips for the spinach dip were so awful we couldn't even chew them up, my sizzlin sirloin was well done when I asked for medium, the potatoes were awful, the brunch burger was just okay (it doesn't need the ketchup on it). We ordered 2 desserts and one came out before we were informed they were out of the other.  We came here every time we went out to eat somewhere with our family and I'm glad we had gift cards this time! This is our final dinner here at Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-senatobia-2
PJ T.,"Germantown, TN",138,35,70,1.0,1/2/2017,"Service and food were both very bad. We stopped here after the polar express and I would not recommend this place at all. Every dish we had in our party of 9 was terrible, over seasoned, over cooked. There were several tables all around us that still had dirty dishes and the restaurant as a whole was dirty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-senatobia-2
Bluescity 1.,"Memphis, TN",1,19,39,4.0,4/23/2017,"This is typical chain style food, but with that being said. I was served a surprisingly good burger here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-senatobia-2
Jason B.,"Los Angeles, CA",94,22,22,5.0,7/16/2016,This is a Dry county which means they cannot sell alcohol! Prohibition still exist in the south. This city passed an ordinance legalizing it in the city and this is the first legitimate restaurant to come to town. I've been there twice. First thing you notice walking up to and entering is how immaculately clean it is. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and it did not disappoint. The bun was already big but the burger was bigger and there were nice little bites to enjoy it before getting to the Burger. It was so juicy that you could feel it squirt all over your mouth as you bite into it. The fries were delicious. For $10 I really got more than what I paid for. The service was incredible. Our waitress came by at just the right intervals. The manager came by about two-thirds of the way through our dining experience. I highly highly recommend this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-senatobia-2
C H.,"Senatobia, MS",9,5,,1.0,12/18/2016,Service sucks!  And drinks are horrible!  Too bad I have been to a lot of applebees before and they were good but this one is neve consistent with any food item or drink.   Nice bar area to spend time with friends. Too bad it's food is awful.  Order the beer or wine .. not mixed drinks.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-senatobia-2
Jim A.,"Ridgeland, MS",0,6,,1.0,9/8/2016,Couldn't make a comment without clicking at least 1 star.  Or else I would have clicked 0 stars.  Can't believe this place is still open.   Service was TERRIBLE.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-senatobia-2
Rustygirl M.,"Chicago, IL",0,147,2,1.0,12/25/2015,"It's Xmas today so I wish I could be nice. But I can't.  It started at the door as we waited and waited to be seated.  Then as we were escorted to our table we passed several tables that weren't clean, eve though they weren't busy. Next I order soup and a wedge salad. After several mins the waitress returns and says no salads are avbl. My soup comes out next but the bowl is only half full. I had to ask it to be filled. Had it been busy I would have understood but instead the waitstaff seemed to be handing out in the kitchen! Our dirty dishes sat in front of us the entire time! Nobody picked them up even tho we ordered dessert. Beverages were left sitting at the bar forever!  Just a mess here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-senatobia-2
Larry J.,"Senatobia, MS",5,17,1,1.0,10/3/2016,Filthy... Went here once and it was absolutely gross.... Tables covered with dirty dishes no one there just dirty dishes???? Covered with flies... The chips we got were stale and the cheese was still frozen on the inside. Why is this place still not shut down for health reasons is beyond me. Obviously management has no intentions of cleaning this mess up. Wouldn't dare use the bathrooms after seeing the conditions of the tables. Imagine what the kitchen looks like yuck.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-senatobia-2
Jason G.,"Germantown, TN",1,28,2,1.0,8/5/2016,It took at least 50 minutes to get our lunch. We were the first to arrive and there were only six other tables that came in after us. The food quality was ok but definitely not worth the wait.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-senatobia-2
Richard P.,"Coldwater, MS",6,6,1,1.0,2/23/2016,This place needs a new manager and all new employees. I've walked out of this Applebee's twice and won't be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-senatobia-2
Julie D.,"Southaven, MS",0,19,,1.0,7/31/2015,"Walked out! Seated us in the bar. Waited 15 minutes for a waitress, finally takes our drink order, leaves 1 straw, never saw her again.  In fact, rarely saw waiters/waitresses attending any tables.  Every Applebees has the same complaints, clearly the corporate office hasn't tried to get served at their own restaurants!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-senatobia-2
Kate D.,"Birmingham, AL",0,3,,1.0,11/16/2014,Service was SOO slow! We waited forever to be seated and didn't get our food for over an hour. The workers seen lazy and not in hurry and the place was packed. Don't know how they stay in business. Waste of time!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-senatobia-2
Alan P.,"Memphis, TN",7,37,1,1.0,10/17/2014,"Place is deserted, yet service is very slow. Ordered a large beer, had to send it back, because it was only half glass. Bartender argued that was the proper head on the beer I ordered. Second beer came back flat. I sent it back and ordered a tea. Food was average at best. Don't eat here, McDonalds has better food, and better service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-senatobia-2
Sharon P.,"Georgetown, TX",0,8,1,1.0,2/15/2015,Horrible!   Couldn't even get the waitress to bring me a spoon to eat my soup.   Manager didn't even care and gave some sob story about having to re wash dishes.  Finally gave me a plastic spoon.  Never once apologized and wanted me to feel bad for him!   You would have to be starving and the only place in the area to want to eat here!   Don't do it!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-senatobia-2
Jonathan B.,"Coldwater, MS",0,2,,1.0,4/8/2015,"I am surprised this page isn't flooded with bad reviews.  Every time I eat here they always under cook my food, the service is always slow, and the food is not very desirable.  I could name 40 people who have eaten here who have had terrible experiences.  How does this place even stay open?  This place is still relatively new in the community and yet it has been awful since their opening.  My friend ordered a salad and asked specifically that certain topping not come with the salad.  She gets the salad and guess what those toppings were on her salad.  She tells her waitress that she asked for a salad without certain toppings.  The waitress reaches into her bowl and pulls the toppings off WITH HER HAND!  They need to close this restaurant, tear it down, and rebuild something completely brand new with a restaurant staff that actually knows how to run a restaurant.  DO NOT EAT HERE!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-senatobia-2
Chris S.,"Senatobia, MS",0,3,,1.0,12/1/2015,"Pretty terrible place to eat! Came here with two friends we waited for about 30 minutes after we were told by the host to seat ourselves. That was the host exact words. Finally after getting our drinks in the waiter actually didn't give us menus. Now another 30 minutes go by, drinks finally get served, and our menus get to the table. We find what we want within 10 minutes but of course another 30 minutes must pass before seeing the waiter. I order endless honey bbq boneless wings which are lucky still half off at this time, parmesan shrimp steak well done, seasoned veggies, and loaded potatoes. The endless wings are suppose to be appetizers which come out 30 minutes later with the meal. The wings were fantastic loved them and recommend them only down side is they never come back to give you more. Beats the purpose of being endless right? I eat some of my veggies which were terrible they were seasoned with very strong lemon. Potatoes were fantastic also recommend those. They are loaded with garlic, cheese, and a little ranch. The steak was dreadful. Parmesan is salty I completely understand that but the amount on this steak made it bad. The steak with the Parmesan and shrimp the way it was meant to be eaten was too salty to eat. Therefore I removed the Parmesan and shrimp. The steak was actually good by itself very tender. It does seem like they only know how to cook well done though. One of friends ordered mid rare and actually came out well done. Not sure if this is the chef or the waiters fault. After that we waited on the check which took three minutes tops. We tipped and paid the bill never been back. Keep in mind the whole time we were there it might have been one person at the bar and three dining.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-senatobia-2
