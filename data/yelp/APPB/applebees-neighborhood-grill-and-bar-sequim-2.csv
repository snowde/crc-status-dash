Susan T.,"Chatsworth, CA",0,6,,1.0,12/5/2013,"After a day of hiking, my hubby and I stopped in Applebee's Sequim for a drink and whatever else we decided to eat/drink.  We were seated in the bar at one of those tall tables with stools.  We sat there for about 15 minutes before a waitress came to take our order.  We ordered a couple of beers.  Mind you, aside from the bartenders 3 buddies at the bar, we were the only customers in the bar, and the restaurant wasn't busy either.  I know the people seated at the bar were the bartenders buddies because he was engrossed in deep conversation with them, and referred to them multiple times as ""Bro"".  After the waitress took our order we waited about another 15 minutes and nada, nothing, zip....crickets.  My husband caught the eye of the bartender a couple times but he was too busy with his ""Bros"".  So we walked out - and you can be sure we won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sequim-2?start=40

They sure had a great food photographer.  We ordered for a Wonton , Prawn stir fry served in rice and veggies and a Chicken steak served with Prawns.  The food was so so.Nothing that deserves specificity from me in terms of how it tasted. The cutlery that was provided to me was soiled(had a few crumbs on it). The rice slightly hard and the sauce was the worst. The steak was however way better.  We paid a sum of 33$ .

My wife had the tortilla soup which also got 2 thumbs up. Service was nearly perfect (empty plates could have been cleared earlier). Dale was friendly and attentive. Interior was clean and had a good vibe. Was about 75% full (arrived around 5:30). Almost didn't come because of the bad reviews.

Everyone around us was complaining about the service, also. When the food came, my hubbys fries were cold and greasy, a burger with nothing on it.  My salad was sitting in a pool of water.  The plates came out 5 minutes apart, when we finally flagged down the waitress and asked for condiments for the burger and told her about the fries, she took 10 minutes to bring the mayo and fresh fries out.  By that time the burger was cold.  We were never checked on, never asked if we needed anything and sat with empty 'ice tea' glasses.  The ice tea was so weak that it was really just water with a bit of color.  We are done with Applebees!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sequim-2

Both times it was not good and you wouldn't even recognize it as the same awesome food we got in Nampa, Idaho. On our last visit the food looked like it was just dumped on the plate. The servings were very small and didn't taste anything like the Applebee's we knew. Part of the chips were stale and our artichoke dip was over cooked.

Joan V.,"Sequim, WA",50,3,,1.0,3/17/2017,"Gave Applebees a try last night.  Been there before, its always hit or miss.  Last night will my last though.  I must say, two times before food wasn't good but at least service made up for it. But last night was a total failure on their end.  We were sat, and my father watched the waitress visiting with her girlfriends one both down.  Totally ignoring her new table.  Then when she finally broke away, STILL did not approach us but went back to the kitchen for a tad. She finally came up to our table, we gave her our drink order, hot water for myself, beer on tap for my dad.  Took awhile to get the water, and possibly 15 minutes for the beer.  My dad could see the bar which was not busy at all, but the bartender was too busy chatting at the bar with someone to notice an order had been placed!  When my dad questioned the server her comment back was, ""I know, I will give her the stink eye"".  Five minutes later he had his beer.  Now for the dinner, I had a salad which was okay, dad had a 6oz steak which was cooked correctly at medium BUT, it was incredibly tough!  Dad took his first bite, and chewed, chewed and could not even get through it. (And he has great teeth by the way).  He had to remove it from his mouth and place it on the plate.  Next cut and bite, same thing!  I told my dad his 6oz steak will be a 4oz at looks like.  Our  waitress finally comes up to see how things are.  I'm half done with my salad.  Dad told her the problem and she left quickly to get her manager.  Over 10 minutes later, I had to get up and find the waitress to ask where the manager was?!  She states, ""oh, I told her, I will tell her again"".  The manager came to our table and noticed what my dad had not been even able to chew through. 90% of the steak was tougher than leather. Of course she apologized, asked if they could fire another or offer something different, but we were done.  Dad couldn't eat it.  She offered a free dessert.  That's when I had to ask the manager myself, ""you are going to comp this right?""   Oh certainly she stated.  Although I feel if we had taken a free dessert she would of been happier.  And so, as we walked out the door, I looked over my shoulder at my dad, and his words were, ""goodbye Applebees, never again"".  And those were EXACTLY my thoughts too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sequim-2
Donna S.,"Los Angeles, CA",234,443,537,5.0,1/6/2016,"Applebee's is comparable to TGI Friday, Chli's, and the like..right? I thought so too but this Applebee's might be the top of the line! I ordered a ""7oz grilled onion sirloin with stout gravy"" and it was cooked perfectly. I was really shocked! I also stole food from my other table mates. This is what happens when you don't eat your food fast enough. I will come in and swoop it from your plate because the food is that good. Everyone ordered a burger and fries.

ken w.,"Sequim, WA",19,65,,3.0,11/24/2016,"We had a coupon, let's go to Applebee's. One thing I like about Applebee's, the menu changes and I get something new or different. Plus I read that.  A 6 oz Sirloin sounds good. Mistake. Places like this MUST know you have a coupon when the chef goes to get that chunk of meat for the grill. ""He won't know this is an inferior cut. He just wants a deal"". Well I know a lesser quality cut and and certain amount of fat is Ok. Nuff said. Spit most of it out on my plate. The 4 cheese a Mac and cheese and broccoli and lettuce wedge was great. So was the perfect margaritas. Wife had a Thai Shrimp Salad that was not a full portion. She had a coupon so they gave her less, in my humble opinion.  Wouldn't it be great if a place shared their best when you had a coupon, and the encouraged you to comeback again to spend more?

We were told this 15 minutes after ordering. The replacement steak was over cooked and so tough the steak knife could not cut it. The separate salmon order was poorly done and the broccoli under cooked. Overall, three of the four of us had to eat at another place, because we could not eat the Applebee's food.

Sandy S.,"Port Angeles, WA",196,96,17,1.0,9/29/2016,"Wow. Just wow. Four of us stopped for dinner. We ordered our drinks. Lauren brought them to us, although she was not our server and was assigned a section across the restaurant from us. She proceeded to attack me verbally, using profanity and calling me vulgar names. I was speechless...I know her slightly and had no idea she had a problem with me. I certainly did not expect to be attacked by a Applebee's employee while dining in their restaurant. My companions were shocked. They began to call for the manager loudly. An Assistant Manager came, I was embarrassed and upset so he paid for our drinks and we left without eating. I called the Restaurant Manager the next day and discussed the situation with her. I was called back by the Regional Manager that afternoon. She assured me that it would never happen again, that everyone was very sorry and that what had occurred was absolutely not acceptabe behavior for an Applebee's employee. I was told Lauren would be severely punished...and led to believe that she would be let go. I was asked to return as a customer by the Regional Manager, who stated that my business was important to Applebees. I did return about a month later with the same friends, we ordered our drinks before our meal...and again Lauren delivered them to us! It was obvious she brought our drinks to intimidate me, she was curt and rude. We were all shocked and uncomfortable to see her at our table after our last experience. We again left without eating, determined to avoid another scene. Applebees has lost four customers over this fiasco. Whoever made the call to retain an employee like Lauren, who literally attacked a customer verbally without any provocation has lost our business for good. Lauren used her position as a Applebee's server to intimidate and embarrass a customer who she has a personal issue with, and Applebees has endorsed her unacceptable and unprofessional behavior by allowing her to do it.

Go Hawk S.,"Sequim, WA",47,98,38,3.0,10/6/2014,"Amazing service but food was mediocre at best.  Mom had to have a new plate of chicken made, the first was overcooked and dry. The manager came out shortly after receiving the second plate to ensure it was done right this time. He said he personally cooked it. My burger was dry and bland, not at all enjoyable but decided to choke it down since I knew it was typical for this chain. The Perfect Margy is a great deal at about $8, don't be afraid to order it. Again I have to say the service here is exceptional. Our waitress Shelly was very friendly, very attentive, and all in all a awesome person.

Not many choices in a rural area, so because we have eaten in plenty of Applebee's, we thought why not. I'm not sure what other choices we had or even if we could of found something better. Even in a chain like Applebee's from one to the next the people working there makes all the difference.   Our seating & server were fine. My biggest problem was the food.

I think her name is Jamie. shes tall funny with black hair and has a few kids. shes the best waitress I have ever had. so its really a 50/50 shot. there new lunch menu is amazing!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sequim-2?start=20
Ricardo S.,"Seattle, WA",0,7,,1.0,10/18/2013,"I visited Sequim to attend a birthday celebration and afterwards went to this restaurant for burgers and beer with a friend of mine. We got there around 0:00, the place closes at 1:00am. The restaurant was empty and after a 10-min wait the bartender came by apologizing for the delay since he was talking to his manager on the back of the restaurant... He made sure to let us know how annoyed he was of taking our orders (""I don't know whose burger is this...""). Very unprofessional and rude. The food was below the Applebee's average quality. I wonder if the employees of this restaurant are comfortable dealing with a small town competition  and think they can treat customers with this total disrespect.  Anyhow, my friends that live in Sequim won't go there anymore and neither do I.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sequim-2?start=20
Steve T.,"The Dalles, OR",0,26,9,5.0,8/16/2012,We really enjoyed our time. We have traveled this country and in all off our travels we have never had such a more wonderful waitress as we did today. Her name is Rachel and she not only has a wonderful attitude and personality but she is equally the type of professional every restaurant should have. Thank you Rachel for everything and making our dinning experience a wonderful one.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sequim-2?start=20
