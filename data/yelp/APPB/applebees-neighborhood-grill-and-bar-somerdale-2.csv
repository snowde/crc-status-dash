N A.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,94,60,3.0,10/18/2017,"I don't waste my money on the food here. It just isn't good, ever. However, the happy hour specials are great. They used to have more items for the 1/2 off appetizers option but took a couple of them off recently which is too bad. I always get the boneless wings. The quesadillas aren't bad either. The service is always good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-somerdale-2
Justin C.,"Evesham Township, NJ",33,189,251,4.0,9/7/2016,"Late night eatery at the ""Bee."" Been really stuck on massive salads the last few times I have dined out. This time  was no exception. Had the southwestern steak salad. It was on Fiyaaaaaa. Enjoyed everything about it. Dressing, steak cooked perfectly, seasoned, tortilas, everything bite was great. #ImBigonsalads",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-somerdale-2
Jadiey C.,"Voorhees Township, NJ",58,69,419,3.0,1/16/2017,"This review is getting 3 stars because the service saved the day. My family and I received a gift card for Xmas and we decided to use it for lunch. I can't begin to explain how horrible the food was.  The appetizers were truly disgusting. We had the cheeseburger egg rolls and the pretzels with beer cheese sauce. The egg rolls, were for my son but he didn't like them because they had pickles in them. The pretzels were extra salty along with the cheese sauce.  The truly disappointment was the meals. We ordered the cedar grilled salmon with 4 cheese mac and cheese and potatoes with cheddar and bacon. The salmon was ok, but the mac and cheese consisted of boiled noodles with a few strains of cheddar cheese sprinkled around and the potatoes were extremely cold with extra cold sour cream on them. The second meal was supposed to be an 8oz sirloin, medium with garlic mash and garlicky green beans. They ran out of 8oz steaks, so they substituted with two 4oz, well done, burnt steaks and crunchy garlic mash and cold green beans. Needless, to say this meal was truly the worst ever. I just couldn't accept this meal as my kids deserve so much more. I complained to my server, Gianna and the manager, Madison. Both were extremely apologetic, which made me feel much better. They offered me two new meals and a free dessert, while we waited. I decided to get the meals to go, because I just didn't want to be there anymore.  When I received the check, the manager had only charged for the drinks and appetizers. What a very nice gesture, as this totally made my dining experience a lot better. I'm not a fan of Applebee's, but because of the excellent service, I wouldn't mind coming back. Plus, I still have a nice amount of money, still on my gift card.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-somerdale-2
Lorraine H.,"Voorhees Township, NJ",173,33,16,5.0,5/24/2017,"I think her name is Kaitlyn, but she is amazing! Every time we come here I get a receipt so I can write a great review on her service, but always manage to forget to do it until Monday when it is expired. We sit at the bar every single time and get exceptional service. She remembered us the second time we went! The food is always what you expect it to be for being a chain restaurant. The buffalo boneless wings are my absolute go-to, I also really enjoy their French Onion Soup. Their appetizers are always great and you can get them half off during happy hour too. THANK YOU FOR AMAZING SERVICE!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-somerdale-2
Wilbur S.,"Oaklyn, NJ",52,3,2,2.0,3/7/2017,We frequent this location quite a bit but today my fiancé and I got our food and I had asked for my steak medium rare and it was beyond well done with absolutely no flavor. My fiancé got a chicken pasta dish and all the chicken was burnt. That's what I get for getting a steak at Applebee's on a tuesday night.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-somerdale-2
Nadaya W.,"Wenonah, NJ",17,9,1,1.0,3/26/2017,If I could choose to give no stars I would!!! I had the most awful dining experience for lunch when the restaurant isn't even packed! Kerri the waitress is a liar!!! She lied to my face twice about menu items and my food coming out lukewarm! The MOD was less than helpful! I expected for the wait and conditions of the food that she clearly admitted were less than stellar she would have compensated me on the bill! Never again Applebees better get it together because they are becoming less desirable for me and my family and many other patrons! I hate a liar for no reason! Just bad service all around the board and no amount of patronizing could make up for it! 12:45pm,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-somerdale-2
Rob C.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",17,65,127,4.0,1/11/2015,"If you're no longer looking to impress a new date, but you still want to be a bit fancier than a fast food or a bar - try Applebees!  We had plans to catch a movie at the Cinemark next door at 9:35, so we expected a long wait when we arrived at 8:00 on a Saturday night. The hostess told us it would be 10 minutes, but we were called in about two minutes. The server was friendly, quick, and came back the perfect amount of times so that we had every refill we needed. We got the 2 for $20 deal and ordered the boneless chicken wings appetizer and a pair of the new cedar grilled lemon chicken entrees.  Unlike most places where the picture and the actual meal differ with the meal looking like Chris Brown hit it a few times, the cedar grilled lemon chicken looked exactly like it did in the picture. The chicken was tender and sweet and was covered in chopped granny smith apples, cranberries, rice, and quinoa. We both enjoyed the meal very much and had more than enough time to catch the movie.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-somerdale-2
Lena T.,"Vincentown, NJ",24,10,12,5.0,2/15/2016,We sat at the bar for lunch!   Delicious!   Perfect Margaritas by Christine...Followed by an amazing mushroom burger and an incredible cedar salmon.  Matt the GM runs a tight ship.  Everyone was friendly and food & drinks were fast.  Great atmosphere and food for the money!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-somerdale-2
Kel L.,"Glendora, NJ",38,3,,5.0,4/6/2017,We ordered take out last night and they forgot to give us an order of fries with my sons meal. I called and the manager sincerely apologized.

M B.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",0,6,,1.0,9/25/2015,"This place is just sad. My steak was well overcooked. I ordered rare, it came out med-well. Mashed potatoes were cold in some spots and warm in others. But, hey, the french fries were good.  I rarely, if ever, send food back, but little to no pink on a RARE steak is unacceptable. After 3 visits from the waitress and manager stating my new meal would be out in ""just a few minutes,"" it seemed that it was not coming out at all. 20 minutes or so later, we canceled my order since everyone else at the table had finished with their meals.  Let me also state, that this place was NOT busy. There was absolutely no reason the new meal was not out in a timely manor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-somerdale-2
Timothy H.,"Broomall, PA",3,11,,1.0,1/21/2016,Don't wast your time.  They need new cook in the kitchen. 14$ for burger and fries.

Frank S.,"Cinnaminson, NJ",85,212,407,4.0,6/18/2015,"good old American food. Nice cold drinks, fair prices. Nothing to rave about just a food solid dinner",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-somerdale-2
Lena J H.,"Mantua, NJ",91,82,645,3.0,9/7/2013,"I've been here a few times. This is your typical Applebee's: mediocre in all respects.  It has a few kinds of seating, including small and large booths and bar seating. It has always appeared clean to me. It is decorated with a lot of local nostalgia - weird or awkward photos of local high school Sterling's sports teams.  The food is the same as any Applebee's. it's really nothing special or anything one craves, but if you're looking for an American food style restaurant for a few friends plus alcohol, then this fits the bill. Burgers, salads, pasta, and dessert. Things I've noticed about food I've gotten: the French fries are supremely overstated - inedibly so, the skin of the baked potatoes is encrusted with salt, they don't have Italian dressing, the veggie burger is not good, the chocolate mousse desert shooter is supper tasty, and the perfect margarita is a good cocktail choice. I've never had to wait for a table, but it is typically populated with diners. The wait for the food is unusually long though based upon how many fellow diners there are...don't come here if you're starving. I'm generally patient, so it wasn't too big of a deal. The service I've had has ranged from average to awesome. I had a waitress last night (Britney?) who went above and beyond to help me get something I liked (not easy here being a healthy eating vegetarian). It made the experience so much better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-somerdale-2
Jay W.,"Westville, NJ",173,789,47,1.0,3/11/2013,"A very busy Applebee's due to it's location right next to the movie theater.  Applebee's isn't my favorite to begin with, the food is standard american, but over time the portions have decreased in size and the prices have increased.  This is pretty pretty standard for huge chains like this, and not my real problem with this particular applebee's.   The biggest problem is that it is made clear that they don't need your business due to a steady stream of movie goers coming in and out.  Servers disappear for long periods of time, forget what you ordered, and even made faces and rolled their eyes at the simple request of asking for silverware that was left off of the table.  I was there for a post movie drink and appitzer, I can't wait until the dinner across the street opens so there will be better quick bite options close by after a movie. If the walmart served alcohol, I'd go there to eat instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-somerdale-2
Soku M.,"Willingboro, NJ",3,15,68,3.0,2/2/2016,As far as Apple bees go this one is pretty decent. I've never had to send food back and they have really good trivia nights on Tuesdays. The staff just works there they don't do anything special but for a chill time before or after a movie it's fine.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-somerdale-2
Shannon T.,"Middletown, DE",9,12,2,1.0,10/26/2015,"I never write reviews but I had such a bad experience that I had to. This location is awful. Went with friends for half priced apps and there were maybe 5 tables total in the restaurant. Food took FOREVER. Maybe 35 mins which makes no sense, considering there's no one at the restaurant. My plate was not hot but I didn't want to wait for a new plate to come out, so I just dealt with it. Every time I come here, I don't enjoy it. Deptford Applebee's will have my business from now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-somerdale-2
Daniel S.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",70,140,25,1.0,1/25/2014,Horrible service and horrible food. Caesar salad barely had dressing.

Jason P.,"Somerdale, NJ",36,166,,3.0,7/10/2013,"It's Applebees; if you expect anything more than substandard service and food...you need to not even bother.  I know what I was getting into when I walked in the door.  Went with a group of 8 on a Friday night.  We called ahead to make sure we could get a table.  They kindly held a table for us, which is much appreciated.  The waitress was extremely friendly and was constantly coming over to make sure we had enough drinks or if we needed anything in particular. The menu is standard, it very rarely changes drastically, though I did notice their portions have dipped a little.  That is probably a good thing in the end for customers that walk into this place.  The gf and I split the new pretzel appetizer with cheesie beer dip.  It was delicious.  The salty/butteriness of the pretzel and richness of the cheese was the highlight of the evening.  I had got the blue cheese burger, cooked medium.  It was about what you'd expect.  The fries were freshly cooked and seasoned well.  Everyone else at the table looked to at least enjoy their meal. All in all, it was a good time.  Set expectations low and just roll with it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-somerdale-2
Steven B.,"Mount Laurel, NJ",36,6,,1.0,10/18/2015,"I HAD A BUG IN MY DINNER PLATE! When my wife went to get the Manager, the Hostess asked: Do you know what kind of bug and was it in the plate when i began to eat my meal.

Alexandra F.,"Jersey, Jersey",60,3,8,1.0,10/12/2013,"First, our waitress never introduced herself. Then, our drinks took over 10 minutes to arrive, after that there wasn't a staff member to be found.

Ingrid W.,"Canal Winchester, OH",17,41,2,1.0,9/8/2012,"I would leave no stars if possible. The service WAS THE WORST I EVER HAD! We walked in and the place was EMPTY. There were like maybe 5 table seated. We were seated promptly. We had to wait at least 10 minutes before the waitress came over the first time. We weren't ready to order yet so we asked her to come back in five minutes. It took her another 10 minutes to get back over to us, meanwhile we saw her hanging out behind the bar talking to the bartender, and we were unable to get attention. After ordering she disappeared again, after waiting over 20 minutes for 2 appetizers to come out, another waitress (who we saw doing ALL the work for ALL the tables) came out, dropped our food on  the table in a huff and left. Our waitress came over before I could even take a bite and asked if everything was ok, but she walked away before I could even respond. About 2 minutes later I finished my water. I placed it at the edge of the table so she would be able to see it. After that point  I saw her talking to the manager, she knocked stuff to the floor and other waiters had to clean it up, she was behind the bar with the manager listening to one direction and talking about her opinions about the music. I tried to flag her down repeatedly ,and stare etc her etc, she purposely turned her head away. The MANAGER did the same. I NEVER GOT A REFILL ON WATER! I tried to get other waiters and waitresses, they all looked at my empty water glass before approaching and then as they walked by quickly averted their eyes ignoring me so I could not get a refill. When we finally asked for the check (after sitting for another 20 minutes without eating, as we could not get her attention as she was too busy flirting with the manager), she ran threw down our box and threw our check down and disappeared again. PS I KNOW {ART OF YOUR STANDARDS IS THE MANAGER COMING OVER TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS OK AND HE NEVER DID!!! You have been warned NEVER COME HERE THE SERVICE ALWAYS IS TERRIBLE!!! I will be sending out a mass e-mail to about 500 of my acquaintances in the area after this to warn them away from this Applebees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-somerdale-2?start=20
