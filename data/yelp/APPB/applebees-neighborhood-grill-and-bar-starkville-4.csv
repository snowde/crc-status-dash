Percella S.,"Pineville, LA",0,89,73,3.0,2/4/2016,"Service was superb; just wish I could say the same for the steak I ordered. It was tender but unseasoned, cooked medium well, but lacking the robust beef flavor you'd get at a steakhouse. Meh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-starkville-4
James L.,"Washington Ave./ Memorial Park, Houston, TX",0,22,,1.0,12/23/2017,"Applebee's has just gone DOWNHILL. MOST of the Mississippi locations have gone downhill. To start, the waitress was rude, and she was walking away as we were telling her our orders. She got our order wrong and it was served on dirty plates. She also charged us $20.00 for things we didn't even order!!! LIKE COME ON!!! We told the manager but he said ""Do it look like I give a crap man!?!"" He charged us $10.00 for complaining to him. Like how is that allowed!?! Won't be returning any time soon. If you're staying in Starkville and need a place to eat that isn't fast food, just go to Columbus to eat (they have better options).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-starkville-4
Doc S.,"Starkville, MS",0,5,,1.0,12/14/2017,"Cheese on the burger... Ordered soup.  Arrived with no spoon and no returning server so I went on a hunt and found my own.  My burger came, but hmm it's crunchy in side.  I access both my long term and short term memory and ask myself ""self, does a hamburger usually crunch""?  No I reply, inside my head.  So I open it up and the cheese is on the burger still in its wrapper.  I guess this is how they save time to meet the lunch time special timer.  I call over the server who has finally emerged from the kitchen and show her.  She calls over the manager who asks if I'd like another one.  No, I didn't have time for them to cook another (as this one had melted plastic on it). Most places would have apologized and eaten the cost of the soup.  Nope; not Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-starkville-4
J B.,"Charlotte, NC",0,2,,1.0,10/22/2016,"Once again, absolutely HORRIBLE service. The manager on duty apparently cares very little about service and more about chatting with her friends. Sat for 15 minutes with 7 different servers passing us by, including pressing the ""call server"" button, only to nobody come to our table. And for those wondering, they were full-staffed and Half-full.  This place is only open at this point because of their cheap food deals, otherwise this particular Applebee's would have been closed a long time ago. Their management has been a disaster over the years and continues that trend up to today. Do yourself a favor, go to Buffalo Wild Wings if you want a quick meal with good service *i have no affiliation with BWW*",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-starkville-4
Stephen F.,"Apopka, FL",116,647,692,3.0,1/6/2015,"Stopped in on our way into town for a late dinner (beer specials start again at 9:00 PM). Monday night and most of the burgers were $6.99, and mine actually resembled the picture on the menu. Sat in the bar and enjoyed playing Jenga as we waited for our food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-starkville-4
Siobhan G.,"Grapevine, TX",42,29,6,1.0,10/30/2016,"I came here with a few friends, the waitress was lovely, however they served us our meals on dirty plates. Would not recommend going.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-starkville-4
Beth E.,"Flora, MS",4,74,190,4.0,12/19/2015,"Recognizing this is not fine cuisine- my daughter and I had a most delightful meal here/ we started with these chicken wonton nachos that had a spicy coleslaw on top of crispy fried wonton! It really was good - and we ordered from this little pad thing at our table - so FUN! I had side Cesar salad that was fresh and good - very good value for what I paid- got a cup of French onion soup- don't bother with that NOT fresh!! My daughter had this triple hog dare you- which had little fried onion rings on top of pork (bacon, ham, pulled pork) and cheese - she likes pork- and she was happy !! Dessert was ordered from they pad thing success good!! Apple chimi cheese cake - had FUN and it's vey cost effective!! Wait staff so sweet and happy/pleasant!! Had water almost immediately !! Ordered unmentionable wine from pad !! Good experience!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-starkville-4
JeffandCheryl L.,"Kilmichael, MS",1,14,34,3.0,9/10/2014,An alright place to eat while in Starkville but don't get your hopes up to high for exceptional food an service. We ordered from the 2 for $25 menu. Steak for one and shrimp for another. Ordered medium steak was over done tough but had alright taste. Shrimp was cooked to long almost burnt. Service was ok but needs to learn more about menu and all items.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-starkville-4
Dan C.,"Starkville, MS",0,10,,2.0,4/4/2015,Can not expect much at 2 for$25. And that was true. The shrimp was very greasy but was served 15. Salad was very good.  DO NOT go men's rest room. It smell gross and was not clean.  Killed my appetite     Service was excellent,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-starkville-4
Skip R.,"Monticello, MS",2,69,56,3.0,9/24/2012,"I have never been blown away by the food at Applebee's. The service always seems to be good. The food is what I expect for the prices and setting. The maple blondie dessert is worth the visit though. Time after time I come back to this dessert. As long as they serve this, I can order a so so entree, because I know what awaits me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-starkville-4
