kelly r.,"Sturgis, MI",1,10,,4.0,8/24/2013,"I had previously left a bad review from a visit a year or so ago. We went again today and the difference was remarkable! Our server Jon was friendly and funny with just the right degree of attentiveness. My mother-in-law and I ordered the fish and chips and it was delicious. I especially liked my salad, the toppings were very good. My husband had the bourbon burger and onion rings. He said his burger was cooked just right and the onion rings were very good too. We will definitely go back now that they seem to have improved so much. Thanks Applebees for a pleasant lunch!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sturgis-2?start=20
Phil P.,"Schaumburg, IL",52,170,,4.0,1/11/2016,"I had the pleasure of dining here last night while in town on business.  Usually, when I travel, I prefer to eat at local joints, non-franchised...but if you've ever been to Sturgis, you quickly realize that this is about as ""fine dining"" as you can get.  Besides, I just wasn't feeling Mexican food or fast food, so Applebee's it was. My server was Tom, a very friendly and chatty guy who genuinely seemed to enjoy his job.  Check-in on Yelp got me free fried green beans (score!) which were delicious.  The main course was the grilled salmon with a side of fire roasted veggies.  Everything was phenominal!  The salmon was perfectly grilled, moist and flavorful.  But those veggies...WOW!  I'm very impartial to veggies in general, especially lately, but these were in a class of their own. All in all, great experience.  The next time I'm in town, Applebee's will be on the radar...unless I'm feeling like Mexican food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sturgis-2
Jen S.,"Cressona, PA",0,127,,2.0,9/25/2017,"Service was pretty slow.  Food was okay.  Not the best, not the worst.  I suggest striving to be better so people want to come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sturgis-2
Kathryn B.,"Millersburg, IN",22,1,3,2.0,10/23/2016,I would suggest checking your order before you leave if you get carry out. We ordered the same meal in the restaurant a few months earlier and loved it. I ordered 3 take outs and was disappointed. The one order was even missing the the shrimp on the chicken.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sturgis-2
Mike V.,"LaGrange, IN",25,27,20,4.0,6/6/2016,Always great service even if the food is your typical frozen chain restaurant food.  It's nothing fancy but overall it's worth 4 stars given the area and lack of competition.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sturgis-2
The M.,"Bronson, MI",61,7,,2.0,5/16/2016,"So so service. Wasn't super clean, table needed rewashed, walls next to table dirty...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sturgis-2
April T.,"Southwest, Las Vegas, NV",0,181,992,3.0,6/19/2015,"Applebee's is an ok place to eat at, like at home. The service was good Adam was r server. The only problem was that there was 7 of us and r food did not all come out at the same time.  This place is busy after 5pm. No waiting tho everyone got seated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sturgis-2
Kim D.,"Coldwater, MI",0,5,3,3.0,7/20/2016,slowwwwww 3rd visit 2nd crazy long wait for food.  1st time about 10pm unacceptable wait time. today it's 330 pm and not busy crazy long wait...got our food next table is pissed b/c our vfood is here and they ordered 15 minutes before us.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sturgis-2
Darian H.,"Sturgis, MI",0,21,3,1.0,3/3/2015,"After my decent review  previously,  me and my wife decided to get food to to.  WORST MISTAKE EVER!  I ordered a cowboy burger and it comes with fried onion straws on top of the burger and obviously whoever fried them overloaded the fryer basket because there was a a HUGE mound of soggy under cooked onions atop my burger.  The burger comes with bacon and there was none on my burger.  The worst offense was that the burger(s)  was actually two smaller burgers glued together by cheese in a horrible attempt to pass for a legit buger.  Horrible i called the manger and threw the burger away completely unedible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sturgis-2
Giovanni M.,"Yonkers, NY",1,4,,2.0,12/8/2015,Sucked ...just sucked. Its not hard to follow simple corporate microwave food standards. If you meet what you expect people will be happy. They did not meet already low expectations. Service was decent and timely however.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sturgis-2
Joshua R.,"Sturgis, MI",3,10,,1.0,8/20/2015,Car side togo was horrible all food was cold steak was raw  vegetables were not cooked this was just a horrible experience,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sturgis-2
Kelly H.,"Kalamazoo, MI",19,10,,2.0,1/12/2016,"This Applebee's is going downhill and it's going downhill fast. My parents and I used to come to this restaurant all the time for hot really good quality meals because it was the only place to go here in sturgis. However I don't think this place is going to last with all the new places going up. The food always sucks The past year I've gone here when I'm back in the area on lunch dates, dinners or half off apps with friends the food always sucks. It's cold, it doesn't look right (spinach dip looks like runny puke), it's over salted or they overcook it. Go an hour up to kalamazoo and the quality goes up. food is hot and the cook actually know how to cook. You would think being a chain hey would all be same? You're wrong. Better off going to wing ect. Or buffalo wild wings if you wanna burn 40$ on 2 people. probably will get a way better meal anyway. Even culvers offers WAY better quality food.  Done coming back to this place. I've hoped it would get better every visit but it seemingly gets worse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sturgis-2
Brian W.,"Sturgis, MI",1,1,,3.0,9/3/2015,Manger was super nice. Food needs a little work but over all pretty good. Need a better waitress she seems to have no time for her tables.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sturgis-2
Kristy H.,"Grand Rapids, MI",4,7,1,1.0,8/13/2014,"Just so everyone knows, everything you order from here is microwaved. I got this info directly from a Health Department employee. So, if you feel like spending $60 on a microwave TV dinner, knock yourself out! I choose to pass.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sturgis-2
Bobbie G.,"Howe, IN",0,1,,2.0,2/14/2015,My husband and i went there last night ordered a steak medium well and it came out bloody we sent it back and again came out bloody so they offered us to high ave a complete new steak and we said ok that steak also came out bloody twice finally the 3rd time they got it rite and they told us that they would take 50% off our bill for our trouble then when we got the bill they charged us for the second steak they offered and then took 50% off our bill so really we didnt get a deal and it took probably an hour to actually get to eat,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sturgis-2
Kolleen L.,"Sturgis, MI",21,2,,2.0,9/5/2015,They are always so slow here!  It would make a big difference if servers let you know they are running  behind on 3 tables in the house.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sturgis-2
Blossom K.,"Sturgis, MI",24,1,,4.0,7/24/2014,"Tonite I had a steak that tasted like a hot dog that was grilled over a campfire. I came to have steak and I pretty much had a hot dog that I could of made myself. On the other hand,I had an amazing artichoke dip filled  portabella mushroom that I highly recommend. It was cooked just right and I also ha some amazing red potatoes. They needed a little salt, but they were still the best part of my meal. Overall, I give this Applebee's 4 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sturgis-2

David H.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,7,,4.0,12/12/2012,"Very good! On Friday nights, the place can be packed... But we had great service nonetheless, and all of us in family have been happy with our food.
