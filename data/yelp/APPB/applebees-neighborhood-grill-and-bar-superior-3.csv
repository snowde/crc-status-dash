Jazmine D.,"Minneapolis, MN",957,348,765,4.0,8/30/2017,"Stopped in today for lunch. I must say that this was one of the better experiences that I've had from an Applebee's. We ordered off the two for twenty five menus which came with an appetizer.  I enjoyed the packers decor on the wall. The mozzarella sticks were hot and stretchy. The tomatoes and onions in my dish seemed a little over cooked, but it was still a really good lunch. We also got the mac and cheese which was super yummy.  Our server was super fast and friendly. She greeted us with a smile and got the order right which has been a rare occasion for most places that I've eaten at in the past few months.  I would definitely come back for lunch again and try other things at this location. Or I may come back to explore their happy hour menu. Looks like there are a lot of great things on there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-superior-3
Caroline L.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,7,,5.0,6/1/2017,"Crazy good Happy Hour. I couldn't believe it! Twice a day. LOTS of happy hour food options to go along with the drink specials. Also, they recently brought back Riblets so I am sooo happy!! Wednesday nights Riblets are all you can eat",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-superior-3
Robert B.,"Middletown, CT",0,18,,3.0,10/19/2015,"So I went back, the staff was a bit more attentive than last time.  I couldn't understand why the bartender was waiting tables.  It took some time before he could take my order for something to go as he paid more attention to the tables than the bar.  Got my order quickly and it was still warm when I got home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-superior-3
R S.,"Green Cove Springs, FL",0,115,,2.0,12/11/2015,"I generally am a fan of Applebee's, we have friend that works at one in the metro area and it always is good in food, drinks and service. This location however needs some work. Stopped in for lunch instead of a quick stop at McDonald's. I had a burger and fries, while my wife had some sort of Mac and cheese/sandwich combo. Both were below average. The fries were so heavily seasoned that I could hardly eat them and the burger was cooked properly, but just did not taste good. There was some sort of processed slop on top that had no taste and a bad texture. The lunch was well over 20 bucks and not worth half of that. Guess it will be McDonald's from now on. Oh, the server did a good job and I really liked their new wireless tabletop device, no waiting for the check and all that time consuming back and forth stuff. Nice feature.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-superior-3
Eric-Belle N.,"Shakopee, MN",63,3,,1.0,8/8/2015,"The service was friendly enough, but the food was bland. My coffee must have been brewed several hours before it was served. The table was sticky and we were anxious to get our bill and leave. Our server was pleasant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-superior-3
Matt B.,"South Range, WI",0,2,,1.0,10/31/2015,Had terrible service once we got our food the waitress never came back to see if we needed anything. We had to flag her down if we needed anything. i ordered one of there iced mocha drinks from the bar the bartender did not know how to make it. He had to look it up which was fine but in the mean time he waited on 3 other tables. By the time I got the drink I was done with my food. The manager delivered the drink and I asked her for a refill on my water. She took my glass and never came back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-superior-3
Ryan T.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,5,,1.0,2/20/2014,"On the plus side, the food at Applebee's is a good cleanse option (much like sugar-free gummy bears from Haribo).  On the negative side, I would rather not shit my pants after eating something.  Also, the service is usually fine at this location. Applebee's seems to be one of the most popular restaurants in Superior, and I still can't fathom as to why.  The food is absolutely atrocious and disgusting.  Pretty much the only thing that is worth eating at this place is the mozzarella sticks, and that's saying a lot. I would rather eat at the food court at Target next door than step food into this establishment again.  I suggest that you try one of the very limited local restaurants in Superior and give them some business instead of Applebee's, or at the very least go to Grizzly's. If you must eat at Applebee's, wear a diaper.  Or, eat before you go and just drink your dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-superior-3
Jeff K.,"Duluth, MN",0,1,,1.0,11/15/2014,"I was interested in having a nice dinner with my wife and son who we don't get to see all that often any more, he was real hungry and wanted to go to Applebee's  for dinner. We walked in and were seated right away, that was at 7pm. We got our drinks right away and ordered at the same time. After forty five min. the waiter finally came by and asked if we got our food yet, I could only just look dumb founded at this guy and wonder if you as my server have not brought me my food how would I've gotten it yet. At eight pm I had had enough of this bad service. My family was hungry so we just got up and went one block away to grizzley's and were served the same meal in twenty min. The things I found wrong with this place was that the server justin did not seam to know what was going on, the lady manager that walk by my table several times would not even make eye contact with me when I tried to get her attention. I have worked in the food service industry and if you're waiting more than twenty min for your food no matter how busy you are you are failing in the game of customer service. I feel that my family was just forgotten about and will never go to this place again even if it was completely free.

Chelsea C.,"Superior, WI",2,9,5,4.0,2/10/2012,"Waited a long time for food. Wasn't bothered by the wait however, our wait was acknowledged by our server who offered us free shooters for the wait. Very nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-superior-3
Jeff H.,"Duluth, MN",0,120,44,1.0,6/23/2014,"Seriously the last place you'd ever want to eat! Poor food. Poor service. Poor location. Overpriced. And to top it off, they pay their servers the federal minimum (for service industry workers) of $2.13/hr.  If you're going to insist on eating at an Applebee's, at least go to the Duluth location where servers are paid the standard minimum wage of at least $7.25/hour. But even that Applebee's rates maybe a 2 out of 5 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-superior-3
