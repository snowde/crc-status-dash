Evie D.,"Corona, CA",55,8,1,1.0,6/26/2015,"We walked in and they weren't too busy so we sat at a booth. The server was very quick to get our drink orders. When he came back with the drinks, he took our order. We had a very hungry 3-year-old and asked the waiter if they could rush his food. The waiter assured us that we would get it as soon as possible. Then the waiting began. We all had finished our drinks when the waiter finally came back to see if we needed more and he provided refills. He assured us that our food was coming out. We waited more. Finally the food arrived for two of the four people at our table. The child's meal was not one of them. We all waited to start eating until everyone had their food so the two that came out first were cold by the time the other food came out.  Boy, was it disappointing! The child's plate was $5 and came with a mini slider with a child's handful of fries. There was more empty space on the plate than food. Wendy's gives more food in their child's meal and it's only $4 ($2 after 4PM). My food tasted good but for $14, I expected a lot more than a lunch portion. I was missing my breadsticks and the server said they would be right out. We also asked for mustard for the slider. My son finished his slider and I was almost finished my meal when the server finally came back with the breadsticks and no mustard.  We then asked for an Iced Tea refill and the server left. The server took forever to come back with the refill. I was just about to get up when he came back with the refill but he didn't bring ice. I should've complained to the manager but we were done with this place. Expensive food, small portions and SLOOOOOOW service. We will not be back to this AppleBee's again. It's a shame because I've been to a lot of different locations and have always left happy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-temecula-2?start=40

SoCalRestaurantCritic ..,"Murrieta, CA",369,106,17,4.0,4/15/2015,"5 of us came in and thought we would perhaps get better service in the bar area. When we went in, there were six other full tables and a few at the bar, we were right. As soon as we sat, the bartender Keith came by and greeted us and took our drink order.  We got our drinks rather quickly and soon ordered our lunch. We ordered, two of the bacon, bacon hamburger with Blue cheese crumbles on top, oriental salad, Lemon chicken with rice and the pretzel sticks as an appetizer. All the food was good, hamburgers were over cooked and the balance of the meal was good. The lake of taste and overdone burgers were made up by the 5 star service we received.  Kieth came back many times checking in on us and making sure our visit was a great one. Refilled our drinks and stayed on top of our dining experience.  Five stars goes to Keith and staff for a wonderful experience. Be sure to sit in the bar area next time you visit Applebee's and ask for Keith!

I hope you learn a lesson and not make this your end all be all job. Because you sucked and management should have a talk with your aweful services I would have tipped way better.

Rhendi C.,"Temecula, CA",165,23,1,4.0,9/22/2014,"This review is specifically to highlight our amazing server Joseph.  Me and my boyfriend came here a few days ago. We sat in the bar area in a nice booth. TV's were big with a variety of sports to watch. Joseph greeted us and told us he would be taking over the table. He was immediately warm and friendly. I asked him questions about specific dishes and he seemed very knowledgeable about the menu items. Basically what happened was I ordered the Roma Steak medium rare which comes with potatoes and a mushroom cap filled with artichoke dip. The steak came out and it was over cooked to probably medium well to well done.  Joseph came back and asked if I was happy with my meal. I wasn't going to say anything because I was a server for three years and I know how difficult it can be. I've never sent food back ever, mainly because by that point I'm really hungry and I'll eat anything anyway. But Joseph could see that I wasn't completely satisfied so he asked me to really give him an honest answer. I told him that the steak was over cooked but that he didn't have to take it back, seeing as how I'd eaten almost half of it at that point. He INSISTED that I hand the steak over to him so that the kitchen could re-make it. Shortly after, I received my steak and it was cooked perfectly. He was also nice enough to give me another yummy mushroom cap. Joseph was great, he was funny, nice, and professional. A definite win for applebees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-temecula-2?start=40

It was good for what it is - casual dinning.  Greeted quickly at the door and had a prompt and mindful waiter, Kurt.

RJ S.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,62,23,1.0,4/23/2017,"Since when did it become unacceptable for a restaurant to ask a couple to quiet their screaming baby while sitting in the BAR area?  This was absurd. The baby was screaming when this couple came into the restaurant. They didn't sit in the restaurant.... They sat in the bar area because they wanted happy hour prices, which is fine because you can't get happy hour prices unless you were sitting in the bar area. But why is a baby even allowed in the bar area?  Maybe you should offer happy hour prices to families that are sitting in your ""restaurant"" area so adults that are sitting in your ""bar"" will actually come back. I felt like I was at Chuck-E-Cheese. I couldn't enjoy my food. Why a manager never came into this area is beyond me. You could hear this child scream from the freeway. I asked to have my entree removed. My husband took his sandwich in grief. The plastic box split open as we were walking into the parking lot, the food went everywhere they didn't even secure the lid. Everything but my margarita should have been comped. But I can't even say the $30 was a waste of money because I was expecting drive-thru quality food, and sugary pre-mixed drinks. I literally had to go downtown and get a proper drink because I couldn't handle my life after this experience. Forget your curbside to go and just hook a drive-thru on the back.

He called the cops and literally disappeared!!! Talked to the police then vanished. My two girlfriends were out there giving the police info while I stayed back inside at our booth. Not a single time did the waitress or manager, Vincent, come up to ask if we were ok or if we needed water or anything. Look, I'm not blaming Applebee's for the robbery. It's not the managers fault that someone broke into a customers car , but as a manager myself and working in customer service for over 5 years, I would NEVER not accommodate the customer to my best ability. We aren't looking for a free meal or a discount, all we wanted was someone to  ask if we were ok or needed any assistance. It was completely disrespectful and honestly horrible that a manager couldn't even show compassion for his customers. It's great that they are doing $1 margaritas for the month to remind people they are also a bar, but what they really need to re focus on is their customer service skills.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-temecula-2
Britney M.,"Big Bear Lake, CA",217,625,1057,3.0,11/30/2016,"Alright well I'm not a huge fan of Applebee's to begin with. But I'll do my best to provide an unbiased review just based on the food itself. I will say that anyone who is a vegetarian is going to have a hard time finding something on the menu. There isn't a lot of vegetarian options at Applebee's. Anyway they do have the 2 for $20 deal so that is a positive. Saving money is always a good thing. I did the 2fer deal with my mom; we went with Caesar salad for the appetizer, Mac n cheese with no chicken for the entree. Let's start with the Caesar salad. It was super basic. Minimal amount of croutons and grated cheese; and for me it hardly had any dressing at all. I had to ask for an extra saucer of dressing for both of the salads because they were dry. Next the pasta was decent. It tasted pretty good- I mean without the chicken it was basically noodles, sauce, and tomatoes. So it was a bit plan but there wasn't any other veggie options. The waitress brought out everyone's food but made the wrong dish for me. They mixed up my order with someone else's. So I munched on my salad while everyone started their entrees. Not a big deal but if I didn't have an appetizer salad that would have been uncomfortable to sit there with no food while everyone else was eating. Lastly the brownie dessert with hot fudge and ice cream was my favorite menu item at Applebee's. I might go back JUST for that dessert lol overall I most likely would not go back, or go to any Applebee's by choice lol But if I find myself here in the future- I will just get that fudge brownie as my meal!

It was about 7p.m. at night, and we were seated quickly. After we were shown our table, we wanted to wash our hands first. The bathroom was beyond pleasant, clean, and fully stocked. When we returned, Lyndsey R waited on us right away. She was very friendly to my son, and I appreciated her friendliness. I ordered the Sizzling Bourbon St. Chicken and Shrimp $13.75, and I split it with my son.  He said it was delicious, and I agreed with him. I initially thought this entree would be spicy, but Lyndsey assured me that it is not. And, it is the number 1 question she receives about this dish.

There are many good places to eat and this Applebee's is one of them. I really love their spinach and artichoke dip. It's super cheesy, flavorful and always comes out piping hot. Its served with house-made chips and salsa. They have the 2 for $20 or 2 for $25 specials for lunch. There are many dishes to choose from and with those specials, you get an appetizer to share and a meal for you and another person. Every appetizer and meal in the regular menu isn't available on the special ""2 for"" menu and they won't allow you to substitute.  I also like that their menu has Weight Watcher points for several different plates. I'm not on Weight Watchers, but seeing it in the menu makes me conscious of what I'm ordering and ""sometimes"" make better choices. Service has always been great!

We had the bourbon steak and the lime chicken with an iced tea and Shocktop on tap and a side Caesar salad to split. My steak was tasty and juicy, cooked just the way I asked. (Medium) The sauteed onions and mushrooms were a nice touch and the red potatoes rounded out the meal. My wife noticed immediately that the rice on her plate was crunchy dry, inedible really...Once we got the managers' attention and told him about it, we asked for some fries instead which he brought out. Our server came by in a bit and said he noticed we had a problem, explained the rice problem and he came back with another side of fries. My wife DID like the lime chicken! With the salad and fries she was a satisfied customer again. At the end of the meal our server then brought us a brownie bites dessert, no charge! We did not expect them to do so much to make sure we were happy and going to come back. My wife is very forgiving and rarely has any problems with her food when we go out. We told our server that we really didn't need a desert to get us to come back but it was still a nice gesture.

We went to sit in the bar, and we all kind of just looked at each other making weird faces at one another. This was the most AWKWARD Applebee's bar ever. All I know is during happy hour at the Applebee's back home, it's a little rowdy, football is playing in the background and it's just a fun atmosphere in general. Who in the heck plays 90's contemporary music at midnight at an applebee's? It was just weird. The service was weird too. We ordered a bunch of 1/2 off apps and the food was absolutely horrible. I ordered ranch AND blue cheese with the boneless buffalo wings(supposed to be super hot, no sauce at all), and only got ranch. My dad later ordered the sliders and those never came out. Our waitress left and was M.I.A for about ten or fifteen minutes and she was the only one in the bar at the time. So needless to say, we were waiting for our bill FOREVER.

Luis P.,"Temecula, CA",8,252,20,3.0,9/9/2013,"I can not remember a time when Applebee's was something special, and now even less so, I sadly spent money on this place. At one time they served a decent Onion Soup, but that positive is way in the past, their newer version another sad reminder that this eatery has very few good things to say about it. The Waitress that served us, Tracey g., was a true professional in her demeanor and was rewarded accordingly. Besides her fine service, the food ordered was:  Fish and Chips: at almost $14 a plate it was way overpriced and badly presented. The quality of the food left a lot to be desired, even though their Cole Slaw (of which they serve you such a small serving they must be counting calories in the back) was acceptable. Three pieces of fish, under par fish certainly, with a batter that is a failed formula as far as taste is concerned. Fries are nothing special, look elsewhere for good fish and chips. 2.5 Stars. Cowboy Burger: at $9.99 each, it also lacked the wow factor, and now with fierce competition all over, they did not step up to the plate, they basically keep serving the same bland, uneventful burger. Sizable enough to satisfy the average appetite, the waitress asked if we wanted to include onion rings for an additional $1.75. I do not know why, but it seems that these days the idea of adding fries, onion rings, etc., inside the burger is growing in popularity! As a matter of fact Burger King (possibly now a days one of the less quality burgers available in free America), is including their already highly unappetizing french fries inside a $1 burger. I figure is all about the volume, but little to do with quality taste. Topped with crispy onion strings, bacon and cheese, this one is eatable, but not memorable by any stretch of the imagination. Overprices, average tasting, In and Out down the street puts it to shame for far less $. 3 Stars. Bourbon Black and Bleu Burger, at almost $11 the only thing really attractive is the name. Came with  applewood smoked bacon, bourbon caramelized onions (I do not know exactly what that term is, because what arrived to the table was a gooey, overly cooked, mushy mess for such a fancy way of calling it), jack cheese, bleu cheese crumbles (this bleu cheese was at the bottom of the pecking order as far as Bleu Cheese is concerned) on a toasted bun with smoky mayo (so fancy the title, but so little taste that what is the difference?). A very clear reminder that Applebee's burgers are plain and expensive. 3 Stars at the most. Service was more than adequate, even though we surely waited over 25 minutes for our order to arrive, to the point that the lovely lady in our group suggested she might go to the kitchen to speed up things, she being such a bad cook herself. To be blunt but honest, most of these so called national franchises leave you feeling like you could have done much better spending the same amount at Costco, per say, and end up eating so much better for less money. Of course the old tradition of being served is attractive, but not one of the three in our party had enjoyment eating at Applebee's. This is officially the very last time. We already given this place way too many chances to no avail. 3 Stars barely.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-temecula-2?start=100

I am usually very patient so I did not mind how long it took as long as I get the food. I believed it took around 10-15 minutes to receive our Spinach Artichoke Dip (appetizer). The dip was steaming hot and smelled absolutely scrumptious. My friend and I did not hesitate to munch away and although there was some crispy, slightly burned cheese on top, we just pushed it off and continued to eat it. The cheese did not affect the flavor at all and probably one of the best appetizers on the menu. The two entrees ordered was Three-Cheese Chicken Penne and 7 oz. House Sirloin that came in about 10-15 mins after our appetizer (about 20-30 mins total). I was super excited to dig in as soon as the food arrived. The pasta and the steak were very well presented on the plate/bowl, but when I took my first bite of the chicken penne, it wasn't hot, it was lukewarm. I liked how it tasted either way regardless of the temperature, but not a lot of people would enjoy eating almost cold pasta. I asked my friend for a bite of his steak and it was nearly cold as well but it was really juicy and delicious either way especially when it's medium rare. The service was pretty nice and a server always came in to ask us how we were doing and if we need more water, to go boxes, etc. without us asking. The restaurant is generally great, but the food will need to heat up a lot more. I believe I will be going back again to try out the other entrees to recommend dishes because honestly, applebees is not the best but it's not that bad either :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-temecula-2?start=60

My wife and I are currently fighting getting sick so needless to say we will never ever give Applebees another chance as this was the last time we will allow them to destroy a meal.

Salad was ""forgotten"" and no apology or anything, instead just boxed it up in a to go box and brought it to us because we were done with our meals. Nothing better than day old salad the next day... The whole menu keeps changing and there is not as many options. It seems like all the good stuff has been removed. No more nachos, quesidillas..pasta options changed.

Our oldest got the Mini Cheeseburgers and said it was ""ok"". The potato twister appetizer was ok, nothing spectacular. We only got it cause the kids wanted it but they didn't care too much for the sauce. Not worth the $6 if you can buy a bag of potato chips for $3 The Spicy Pineapple Glazed Shrimp & Spinach wasn't too bad.

My meal was enough for me to share some with him as he was still hungry after he finished his, and he is only 6 so a kids meal should be enough to fill him.  They had very limited vegetarian options, just a vegi patty for the burgers..  The service was good and the host seating people was very friendly.

Jessica E.,"Temecula, CA",3,18,3,1.0,6/24/2015,"This Applebee's is a joke. We've been there about four times now hoping the last bad experience was just a fluke, just to be disappointed all over again. EVERY time we have walked in, we've had to either wait 10 minutes to just be seated, when absolutely no one else is waiting for a table, and the place is empty basically anyway. Or we've had to flag someone down to give us a seat. On several occasions I've even seen what looks to be the manager walking by us and not even saying a word as were clearly waiting for a hostess. The food is just awful. I've been to plenty of Applebee's and I've never been to one like this one before. It seems like everything is microwaved. My kids ordered the child's menu cheeseburger. And when we got it, the bun was completely hard as a rock, I mean we adults couldn't even bite into it, let alone a 3 or 5 year old. Now normally I'm not one to be quick to send food back, for the most part. But we had to send these burgers back because they clearly were not edible. They came back with more cheeseburgers which were again, hard as rocks, completely overcooked in the microwave. They did this FOUR times until finally offering us to choose new food. The kids got macaroni and cheese which turned out to be Kraft macaroni and cheese out of a box. We also haven't found one thing off the menu worth eating, and the waitress' could care less about their service. So we refuse to go back. I'd rather eat at iHop across the way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-temecula-2?start=60
Caster T.,"San Diego, CA",7,57,,4.0,12/7/2012,"So the Mrs. and I were up in Temecula last weekend with our kid to visit some friends out at Vail Lake and when we left, the wife was hungry.  She gets really grumpy when shes hungry so I knew I had to get some food in her ASAP.  Sure enough, we fought yet again about where we were going to eat.  Our typical ""go to"" isnt applebees, but in this occurance its what she wanted.   So we went to applebees which as a corporate chain has been notorious for giving me the runs.  I have IBS but I dont think its IBS related because I have numerous friends who dont have IBS and get the squirts from applebees too.   Anyways, I had a club sandwich (pretty bland to avoid diarrhea) and my wife had a bad attitude and a cobb salad.  Our son had a grilled cheese.  The staff was really nice at this Applebees and we were greeted and served in a timely manner. Our waitress who was a middle aged lady was extremely nice.  We also got to sit by a window on the north east side of the building which faces the intersection of Highway 79 south and a cross road and were entertained by all the people who would attack the applebees parking lot with their cars only to bottom out the front of the car..... that will help the resale value.   Decent food as with any applebees, but this one seemed a bit better.  They have a great staff at this location.  Cant comment on the drinks because we didnt drink.  I had to stop in Escondido on the drive back to use the AMPM bathroom but thats pretty typical.   As for applebees, this is a GREAT applebees.  I would give 5 stars if I didnt get diarrhea.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-temecula-2?start=60
