Kevin S.,"Modesto, CA",69,114,159,5.0,9/18/2017,What can I say... we were greeted at the door and seated fast . Our server Sabrina was awesome and cute as my daughter is. She make sure to get the orders right and they came out fast. Even tough my wife fries were kinda cold and she got another fries out fast. And what was great is the mgr came out greet us and he was great. A good restaurant is when the chef or the manager ( Mike)  comes out to see if all is ok. That's is why they got a five star! We will be back it's better that our Applebee's is modesto,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tracy-6
Karla D.,"Ceres, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/11/2017,"I usually do not like leaving negative reviews; however, I do hope that my review will help improve the experience of this place. I came here with my family for dinner, place was not busy. Took 30 minutes to get our drinks and over an hour to get our food. The first waitress first came and told us she was going on break and someone else would take over our table, she also mentioned that our food was ready to come out. Well the replacement waiter checked in with us after 15 minutes. I asked to please check on our food and it was finally brought out cold. (Most horrible ribs ever).  Overall it seemed like the place is not organized at all. The employees seem to be running around like chickens with their heads cut off. (More training and efficiency is definitely needed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tracy-6
Kattie W.,"Tracy, CA",41,3,,1.0,1/7/2018,"Pretty shit place. Takes forever to get your food. ""Something"" always happens when the food takes forever. Pretty sure they forget about people and if the waitresses actually wrote down the order and not just try to remember it, it would probably help.

Duh...of course you are if we didnt eat but half a bite before a spider tried to tell us to run for our lives!!!! Mike says ill make you a dessert.

I spent the whole visit with two flies flying around my head like a pest halo. The table across from us was bussed but never wiped our entire stay. Appetizers were 50%, however we only found that out after ordering because we were bored and reading table cards. Our server didn't mention it. We were offered lemon, but not sweetener for our iced tea.  The beef in the ""butchers meat and potatoes"" dish was gristle, very little meat. It said sirloin, I say stew meat that needed to be cooked for another two hours. My ""crispy brewhouse chicken"" tasted almost as good as a banquet frozen dinner.

The food was very plain. No seasoning at all. I got the grilled chicken combo with shrimp--ill never get it again. My husband got the garlicky green beans with his meal. Where was the garlic?

Karen P.,"Modesto, CA",133,2,,3.0,12/26/2016,"Day after Christmas, walk in for dinner at about 5:15. For a party of 6 the wait was a half an hour (took about 15). They didn't look too terribly busy. We sat down and waited 10 minutes for our server to come by and ask about drinks. He brought the drinks quickly which was nice, we asked for another minute so others could make sure they knew what they wanted. He had 7 tables and was rushing around we waited another 10 minutes to order. I over heard him say the ""day after Christmas rush"" was unexpected and they were under staffed all around. We finally got our order in, we ordered some appetizers as we figured our actual order would take awhile. We ordered boneless wings and crunchy wings.  THEY HAD NO SAUCE ON THEM, it was as off the took them out of the fryer used an old bowl with a tiny bit of sauce on them and that was it. Anything that could go wrong with the order did.  My son asked for a plain hamburger (no cheese, no nothing). Came smothered in cheese so we sent it back. My baby back ribs were burnt and covered in BBQ sauce to hide it.  The kitchen seemed way too busy (who was cooking back there)? THANKFULLY! Sam (the night manager) came by and I let him know about our food.  Sam comped a few of our meals and threw in desert. Mike our server was equally as great. They did everything in their power to make the situation right. As we walked out I did see Sam (apron and all) working with his team to make sure the packed restaurant had all the help they could get to make sure everyone left happy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tracy-6

Mary H.,"Tracy, CA",338,197,868,4.0,6/9/2017,"One of the few places open late in Tracy, till midnight or later they say. We left at 11:25 pm, and it was still full of people. We were hesitant with the negative reviews, but we were greeted and seated warmly by Natalie, then quickly greeted by our server, Samantha or Sam. She was an excellent server the whole time. Another young man named Sam also came and checked on us several times... We ordered off of the half price happy hour menu. Chicken wonton tacos were yummy. They are small, but there were 4 of them. Next we had the green goddess wedge salad, also really good. Once you chop it and toss it, there is a large plate of salad, with blue cheese and pecans. Really tasty. Finally we shared the boneless wings. These are why I only gave 4 stars. They were heavily breaded and really were just like chicken nuggets. I don't think I would order again. We had the sauce on the side, and ordered two sauces: honey bbq and spicy Asian. They charged extra for the additional sauce, but didn't let us know this. It was nominal, but still... All in all, we had great service and good food at half price, Happy Hour pricing. We will be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tracy-6

The nachos were great and only $5 after 9pm. The drinks were good and the service was good as well. Our food on the other hand was pretty gross. You would expect your $14 meal to be better or at least as good as your $5 appetizer but no, the pulled pork on my burger tasted microwaved and when they brought out my food my fries were completely cold. I asked for a side of ranch but I didn't use it because it tasted sour. My girls mac and cheese with chicken tenders wasn't even edible it was covered in a puddle of grease like it was soup. It showed it in the picture like a baked mac and cheese with pieces of chicken baked into it but it looked like they just threw 3 frozen chicken strips on top of some frozen mac and cheese.

We had to ask a different person to take the rest of our drink order.  We then had to ask someone else to take our food order as our original waitress never came back to our table. It took over 25 minutes to bring us our food and two of the meals were wrong.   I ordered the fish and chips and only ate a few bites as the fish was not cooked properly.  To top it off, the bill they presented us with was wrong and it included items we never ordered.  There are plenty of food options available in Tracy.

Rachel G.,"Fairfield, CA",45,24,11,4.0,9/15/2015,"The Good: Most Applebee's are the same. You've been to one, you've been to them all. The reason we keep the Tracy Applebee's in our date night rotation is the bartender, Krystal. She's friendly, fast and her service has never let us down. As long as she's tending the bar Sunday nights, we'll keep coming back. We also are a fan of their 'Sunday Fundays'. You can't go wrong with an all day happy hour. The rest of the staff here also seems incredibly friendly but we  only sit at the bar.  The Bad: We have a policy when we come here: never order the steaks, never order the ribs. It's actually an Applebee's wide rule for us. Thankfully their menus change often so we usually have plenty to choose from. The Ugly: No complaints on the decor here.

Daniel d.,"Tracy, CA",0,9,2,1.0,8/7/2016,I've been coming here for a while now. I started coming here mostly because of the bar service. The food has always been great. My one complaint is that the quality of service has dropped drastically. I only see 2 familiar faces and the host/service turnover ratio is crazy! Every time I come back it's different people. Employees seem complacent about what they are doing. Yes you get greeted at the door and the smiles are great but don't seem genuine. I recommend only sitting at the bar here. It's the only way you get your order correct and your drinks quickly. Service with a smile isn't really a trademark anymore. Maybe less turn over and more customer service training is needed here.

Over two months ago we visited the Milpitas location (check my review) I also sent this review onto the Corp. Office and in-turn got a call from Eric Schmitt who is the GM for numerous locations including Milpitas & this location is his ""home store"". We spoke over 9 weeks ago regarding our extremely disappointing experience at the Milpitas location. He claimed he would be visiting that area to discuss mine : as well as other patrons issue with the staff. He also claimed he would be sending me a GC to ""try them"" again for better results & extended his gesture: that if I was even in the area to stop by the Tracy location. I have never received anything in the mail, he never followed up! So disappointing and won't be back to  either of these locations @ Applebee's anytime soon.  Seems this GM's territories lack in good customer service and that stems from the corporate, to management, down to him & his staff.

Then my son ordered a corn dog and fries and it was cooked so long that it was hard as a rock. There was also a big piece of lent mixed in with the fries. We hadn't seen our waiter in awhile so I got up and asked the bartender if he could order another corn dog and fries and presented him with the old one.  About 15 minutes later our server comes by and hands my son his new plate of food. No apologies were offered. I asked for two place settings and he brought back two plates. So our table of 5 only had two forks and two napkins. We were offered refills after I had already paid the bill on the little table computer. Paid $50 for a disastrous lunch.

Marco G.,"Tracy, CA",0,4,1,1.0,5/31/2016,"Amy you suck. Lets start with that. We get there,waitress(amy) seems weird to start with,like she didnt want to be there. We order our drinks and appetizer first and then ask just for a minute to look over the wrest of the menu. She gave us 30mins. Literally by the time our drinks and appetizer was gone she came to ask if we had a chance to look over the menu,UM YES B#~%^?! Also adding;when she brought us our appetizer she said ""YOUR WELCOME"" but as if she was waiting to hear a thank you.(which we did say but she must of not herd us). Finally we order our food,a fair wait later they bring out the food and my plate was a totally different meal than i ordered. Some other lady had brought it out so i let her know i didnt think this was my plate and what i had ordered. And tryd telling it was fine tho cuz i didnt want to have to wait another 30mins for a steak to be cooked.  She quickly took it back before i can finish,okay Whatever. Then our waitress comes out and takes our drinks to get refills and apologizes for my order mix up stating she pressed the wrong button. Anyways i have to wait hella long for my correct food to come out,it comes out and she apologizes again but this time stating it was cuz she couldnt hear me.um no?! Cuz u reread my order outloud to me! Why u lien for girl?! Remind you we still havent gotten our refills back. Finaly after eating a little she comes back with my drink and my girl's drink to but...she gave her water...she originally had sprite. Now its time to pay,she cracks a small joke obviously to kiss a lil ass for that tip. Put my receipt on the table but i pull out my card and say she could go ahead and take it now,she quickly takes the reciept back,looks at it,and SWIPE goes my card on the lil tablet thing. Bypasses the amount im bouta pay and goes straight to the tip option and then hands it to me. Then takes off with my reciept. $62?!?!? Wtf was $62 at applebees?!? She walks by our table again so i ask to see the reciept. She had to go print another one cuz she through away the original(mind u this all happened within only 2minutes). As shes reprinting shes talking to her manager(she already knew she fucked up) and comes back with the incorrect charges already circled(i never said i was overcharged yet,i just asked for the receipt). She then says their gonna credit me back $8...she pulls out 8 wrinkly ass dollars and puts it on the table....dis biotch. The whole time she never once came to ask how we wer doing,start conversation or anything. Only the one time she got us our 15min wait beverage refill. Like tf?! I cought the manager eyeballing us acouple times, would have been more pleased if he had came up to personly apologize for the mulitple mix ups,but he hid in the back of the bar area most of the time. Literally not 1 employee had a smile on their face. Beside the super blonde young host,she smiled,she was nice. And then there was this black dude,i think i seen Michael on his name tag,he wasnt helping us but i saw his interactions with his tables,let me say this dudes service looked A1,this guy needs a different job simply cuz he deserves to work for a better company! You the Man Michael!  Anyways,Hoe got no tip ofcourse. And not cuz im some kinda broke ass but cuz her service sucked ass,im normaly a very generous  tipper. Realy chose apple bees to see what talent was there,im activly recruiting for positions at a high-end fashion retail store. Wonder if i got shitty service cuz i look younger or cuz amy had a stick up her ass. Ether way DONT GO HERE!

Anchor Steam is now a good addition to the draft lineup. Lunch entries are modestly sized but soups were hot and tasty. French onion and the tomato soups were both good.

Sara B.,"Tracy, CA",0,6,2,1.0,5/24/2015,"So when first walking in to applebees it was okay. We got seated fairly quickly. When the waiter came to take our order he made everything so confusing because he was trying to split the bill right then and there. At first I was okay with it because maybe it saves him time at the end. In total we ordered 13 items for our table. Our original waiter brought out 2 items and then WENT HOME, leaving us with a different waiter who had no idea about anything for our table. We waited 30 minutes for another 4 items to come out and this is when we began to get frustrated. We then waited another 30 minutes for the rest of the items after the waitress had to ask us what we ordered. When we ended up getting the food it was cold and soggy, but that's not the worst part. We ended up not receiving 1 item at all, we decided we had been there an hour and thirty minutes already so we cancelled the order. We honestly just wanted to go home and watch a movie like we had planned.  We really got mad when she brought out the bill and she had charged us for the item that was cancelled! Also, all that time we had put in the beginning to split the bill obviously didn't matter because it came all together! This was when everyone at the table wanted to run out.  When we told the waitress about our problems with waiting an hour and thirty minutes for food she said, ""it's not my fault"" and took off. Take in mind I am not a person to blame, I was not rude. I only wanted her to fix the problem but, all we got from her was attitude.  We also told her we needed to see a manager she said,""well, we need to know the problem before we can get him,"" really? Because I've never heard of that before. So we told her the bill isn't split, ""oh, i can fix that, you don't need the manager,"" okay... Well you charged us for the item we cancelled after it took an hour and thirty minutes, ""oh, I can fix that too,"" we finally told her her no we need the manager.  When the manager did come he was handed a different receipt that didn't have the item on it, the girl had given him a different receipt than what we were handed and we couldn't even show him because she took it! The manager was also rude though! He only came over blamed us and then took off to divide the bill. Basically he just came over to shove us out as fast as he could, he did not solve any of our problems.  I usually give a place a couple of times before I decide I'm never going back but, this was my last straw. I've already had four bad experiences there.  This place has really gone down hill since Ray left, all the waiters/waitresses that used to be good at their job, now are the ones I'm saying beware to! Our waitress's name was Jessyca Y., if you get her run out as fast as you can! The manager is the problem here though, bring Ray back! It'll be a few years before I try applebees again period, unless I hear Ray's back in town because that's the only way the service and food has ever been good.

Aside from the makeover on the exterior, there must have been a corporate makeover as well? The menu has been updated. This neighborhood Applebee's appears to have had a change in personnel, quality of food, taste and overall customer service. Our server was named Jennifer, as was very pleasant. Jennifer took our drink order. My wife decided on a Raspberry Lemonade, and I decided on the Mango Tea. After the first sip on the Mango Tea, it just wasn't hitting it. The Black Tea overwhelmed the Mango flavor. None the less, Jennifer changed out my drink for a Wild Berry Tea. It was more flavorful....thank goodness because I needed something that was really going to quench my thirst!

The House Sirloins tasted weird like they were about to expired and rubbery too. My Honey Pepper Sirloin was overly sweet like sugarcoated beef.  My cousin's Baby Back Ribs were dry and tough. The beefs weren't tender or even juicy like they said.   Our server was all over the place. He forgot to give us utensils. We waited for him but after 8 mins, we asked a different server to bring them. He also forgot to give us refills where we basically had to share drinks with each other until he can get us the refills. We didn't finish our meals since they were not tasty at all.

L A.,"Tracy, CA",3,14,1,3.0,10/26/2014,"So my comment is not going to be about my overall feelings of Applebees, but more of a complaint I had tonight with this one waiter in particular, DAVID: I've been a regular customer with Applebee's here in which I take advantage of happy hour with a friend. I always order drinks here and am always asked to show my ID, especially since I am well aware that I look younger than my actual age.  Tonight I was out with a good friend of mine and when I ordered my drink, our waiter DAVID asked ""are you even old enough to drink?"". I know he was probably just joking around, but I didn't hesitate to show him my ID. As I was opening my wallet he was there right next to me and looked at my cards in my wallet and made the comment ""Wow, you have like 4 ID's in there. Which one is your real one?"" At this point I got a little mad. First off, he does not know how to count, as I only had my driver's license and CA ID in my wallet... so that makes 2 ID's, not 4. Second of all, I thought his comment was really uncalled for, annoyingly sarcastic, and RUDE. I understand that they should check for ID's, but for him to have the nerve (whether he was joking or not) to criticize me (indirectly) of having fake ID's was unnecessary. And LASTLY, he did not even ask to see my friend's ID, who also ordered a drink, and is also 2 years younger than me. What the f*ck? David has been the first waiter at Applebee's that I have ever had for that only reason. Don't try to be a smart-a** and an a**hole. Overall, Applebee's is good; you get what you pay for. But I don't want David to be my waiter anymore because of his action towards me and also because I did not leave him a tip because of it. lol",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tracy-6?start=80

MC Ratio L.,"Tracy, CA",56,1,,3.0,8/8/2015,"Seating was fast, our waiter for the night Rudy got our drinks fast and had good customer service. I ordered a Spinach and Artichoke Dip for Appetizer and the Napa chicken and Portobellos, which is my go to choice. My appetizer came out fast and within 10 minutes my Chicken and Portobellos also came out, both items were hot and fresh out of the kitchen. Oh yes and I also ordered the Brownie Bite for $1.75( for that price I can never pass it up) Fast and friendly service. I was overall satisfied. The waiter did make our experience better than previous visits.  I gave an A-OK rating because of the following details. :D As many of you may know Applebee's has updated and improved their menu... Since these changes I feel that the portions of food given have changed as well. Yes this is what bothers me. I am BIG on ratios.  Our previous visit is when we encountered the new and improved menu, which to me wasn't that grand, but liking Applebee's enough, I  decided stay and order. I ordered my usual App of Spinach and Artichoke, I should add that it's Happy Hour so they are half price. I then receive my appetizer and  I am frustrated, because somehow it was not the size I remember it being. Plus my dip to chip ratio was way off. I had this mound of chips and a little bowl of dip. Not Cool. I only ordered the Spinach and Artichoke Appetizer, because I normally ONLY order that knowing that is fills me up. But they flipped the script on me when they came out with this half-sized and half-priced Appetizer. I was bummed. But I didn't say anything and just decided that I couldn't hang with the new and improved Applebee's. Then last night my husband and I decide to give them a try again. Like I stated above I had a good experience. This time around I asked the waiter before I ordered, since its half-priced will my appetizer be half-sized? He replied with an oh no it's regular size. This made me happy until it came out. Now it did come out fast and hot, which was good, but my chip to dip ratio was STILL no good. Plus the dip was filled about only half way, which left me feeling half satisfied. Then I anticipated my delicious Brownie Bite, but when it came (yes arrived fast), I was not happy with the size. I felt let down, because this too got smaller. My brownie was smaller and the ice cream scoop was super tiny. I am all about ratios and there was not enough ice cream to go along with my bite size brownie. BUMMER!!! I like having ice cream with every bite, but this didn't happen. When my main plate came out I had a BIG smile on my face. Why you ask, because the ratio was on point and this was the only thing I ordered that was the same as I remembered. I can never finish the whole thing, and I still couldn't. :D HAPPY ME. Applebee's wasn't really my go to place and probably still isn't, but with few options in Tracy, ya  gotta roll with the punches and take it. This Place is definitely a hit and miss in my book.

I mean I can overlook a mediocre meal if the staff really was there for me and not thinking about where they were going after their shift...but even if the food is good, a rotten attitude can ruin an evening. I don't know how other Applebee's staff respond in general, but if you feel the need to eat here, there's really nothing to be disappointed about. Only thing I have to gripe about is that there is a SONIC right across the parking lot.  Where the hell did that come from and what's it doing in California?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tracy-6?start=140

We ordered drinks, appetizer, and food all at once since we had plenty of time to decide. One set of silverware for a table of four and the silverware napkin was torn. We had to ask for more silverware so we could eat. Service was slow to non-existent. No salt & pepper on the table. Had to ask for steak sauce which our waiter completely forgot to bring. We had to ask someone else. Food was pretty good. I got the shrimp combo. Grilled shrimp was delicious but the breaded shrimp was overcooked. Husband got the steak. Also overcooked.

Misty J.,"Portland, OR",18,129,1,1.0,12/13/2009,"No. On the way home from the holiday farm in Lathrop, I saw a billboard for Applebee's. It sounded good at that moment, driving in the dark, being showered with pouring rain. I envisioned steaming hot, cheesy appetizers and a big, satisfying dinner. So I got on the cell horn and alerted the caravan, and we filed into the Applebee's parking lot. While everyone else was parking, my daughter and I went in to put our name in for a table. The hostess looked at me and smiled. I smiled back, prepared to give her my name and have a seat. Nope. A couple minutes pass. She looks at me and smiles again. She was in a conversation with another hostess, trying to figure out tables to seat some people that were in before us. The other hostess went to seat said people, and a group came in behind us. Just as the first hostess was preparing to ask the group BEHIND us for their name, I was preparing to open my mouth to ask WTF....and the second hostess came back and did it for me. The first hostess was like, ""Oh, I'm so sorry, I didn't see you,"" which struck me as a rather odd (and stupid) thing to say, given the fact that she smiled at me twice. Oh well, it's Christmastime, I decided to let it go, put in my name, and wait out the five-to-ten minute wait for our party of five. Once we were seated, a girl came and took our order. I asked for the Queso Blanco appetizer and the Steak and Portobellos. I placed my daughter's order, which needed to be done carefully since she's allergic to milk. 8 times out of 10, this is not a problem. The server was very accommodating, bringing me the ingredient list for the hamburger buns and assuring me that my daughter's meal would be milk-free. Everyone else placed their orders, and we all waited for our food to arrive. First out was the Queso Blanco. It looked DELICIOUS. I grabbed a chip and scooped up a nice amount of cheese and pico, blew on it a bit since I figured it would be HOT, then devoured it with glee. Almost. Um, why is the cheese COLD?! Hmmmm. We all ate it anyway, but still. Cold melted cheese product? What the shit? Then came our food. They put my plate in front of me, and I was very confused. When did DRIED portobello land on the menu? Because people, it's there. The portobellos looked DISGUSTING. I was glad I ordered the mushrooms and garlic topping on the side, cuz the portobellos were so unappetizing, I needed to hide them in my napkin so that I wouldn't have to look at them. Then, biting into my ""steamed"" broccoli, I heard a CRUNCH. What the shit again! Then, my daughter happened to lift the bun on her ""milk-free"" burgers, and found that they had been BUTTERED.  Oh. Hell. No. Do you have any idea how SICK that would have made her, had she not happened to notice that and eaten those sliders? Are you KIDDING me? We had told them, if there is any milk product on or in the buns, just bring out two patties. This is why I was UBER annoyed with another server informed us that the buns are buttered in the morning, before the restaurant even opens. Well WTF, we could have just gone with the patties in the first place, and my ten-year-old wouldn't have to sit there and watch everyone else with their food while she waited for the cooks to make her food correctly. I wanted to kick our server, I really did.  Then, after giving her our credit card, the server took 30 MINUTES to bring it back. WHAT THE SHIT?!?!?! Never. Again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tracy-6?start=140
Michele C.,"Tracy, CA",8,65,,2.0,8/13/2008,"I normally love Applebee's. I used to come here on a weekly basis back in high school. But I'm only doing this review based on last night. It was very strange.  I went here with my friend and her sister for dinnertime around 9pm. Normally I have no problems with this place. There was a significant amount of people, but it didn't seem too busy. Everyone was laid back, eating, drinking at the bar, watching the flat screen, etc.  I'm unsure if it was just the waitress, or maybe they were shortstaffed. But the service was really slow for some reason. It took like 10-15min. just to recieve a beverage. Around the same amount of time of waiting to take our order too. Me and my friends were looking around confused as to why it would take so long for any of that considering how slow it was.  Also, my drink was all weird. I ordered standard strawberry lemonade (one of my favs), and the first time it was light pink but it seemed they put way too much lemonade and pulp and only a little strawberry. When I asked for a refill, she came back with a bright red kool-aid looking beverage. I looked to my friends and then looked at the glass and started laughing.  Did the waitress not even notice the difference? Did the bartender not care? I was really confused. I order this drink everytime I'm here practically, and I have never seen it look like this. I guess I just find it strange bc it's never happened to me before. It was like water with red food coloring with a slight taste of strawberry.  Overall it was just a weird night.

The service was very good, again ""as usual"", and veterans were asked to sign a poster and leave a message and were presented with a hand-drawn ""thank-you"" by some very polite children from St. Bernard's Catholic School in Tracy.  So thank you Applebees for not only your excellence in putting out a consistently great meal with good service, but for also showing respect and appreciation for United States military veterans.  As a veteran, I appreciate it and I will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tracy-6?start=160
