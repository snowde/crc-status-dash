Alexandra C.,"Wilsonville, OR",0,8,,2.0,1/27/2015,"They have started a new computerized thing on the edge of the table that pretty much does the servers job. I went with two other people and the server came and got our order, she wasn't friendly, but not rude either. The gadget on the edge of the table did everything else. Asked you if you needed a refill, or there was a ""Call your server"" button. If I am tipping someone to wait on me I feel like I shouldn't have to use this thing.

Keith B.,"Portland, OR",10,89,3,2.0,6/10/2012,"im only comparing to other chain resturants otherwise it would be 1 star. their food is way over priced for the quality compared to other chains were at least you get more crappy food for your money and sometimes actually ok food. 13.99 for 7oz steak, part of a red potato, and a mushroom with spinach and a very little parm. their steak is premarinated bottom round not steak. it came out over cooked and the server and manager blamed it on the marinade. when it came out over cooked the second time the server said i need to order it rare to have it done medium and blamed the over cooking on the marinade. each time took over 20 minutes but they didn't over cook it...lol. here's a clue 20 minutes is too long to cook that small piece of bottom round they call steak.  the meal got comp'd. the saltiness is also a real problem. BUY REAL STEAK APPEBEE'S and you won't have to marinade,over salt,over cook.  the service was very blah but no worse than other chain's who hire people who just don't care.  their menu is a bit non sensical in that they have a lot of low calorie items but no low calorie drink options. for your own profit why would exclude all your calorie counters from buying a beverage from you??(save diet cola). i been here sevral times before as my cousin like them but never again. there are way too many place to eat where i can get better food for less money. @megan..if i waste my time and money somewhere i will definatley write about it..being a chain is no excuse to serve food that bad and misrepresnt bottom round as steak.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tualatin-2?start=40

I have never ordered food that I was unhappy with, but it is not the kind of food you rave about either.  Happy hour and specials change so frequently, that one could come in twice in a month on the same day of the week and not get the same deals. While most bartenders are great, one in particular tries to nickel and dime you at every single turn.  I do not mind attempts at being upsold, but I personally would never do it to regular customers, especially by offering the same upgrade on multiple dishes (if I didn't want to pay for sour cream on my quesodilla, why would I on my chili cheese dip?).

Rose E.,"Portland, OR",447,462,2334,3.0,9/14/2016,"Applebees is one of my husbands favorite chains. He always gets the same thing.  They seemed a bit rushed this time. There was no wait for us to be seated, but we must have arrived at just the right time, because some parties did have to wait a bit.  Since we always get the same thing, we were ready to order, and drink & food orders were taken quickly, but food orders weren't put in to the kitchen in the order in which they were taken compared to the guests around us that were seated later.  I liked our server a lot. He made conversation with us as though he had time to do so even though he was pretty busy. Much appreciated.  I'm not sure if it was a manager or just a greeter, but another party had left their cell phones and both phones were safely retrieved and held for them. In this day and age, so many people have such a ""finders keepers"" mentality, that I'm very impressed by this. The couple was so surprised and relieved to come back and find their phones waiting for them.  We both made special requests/substitutions in our meals, and these requests either did not make it to the kitchen or on to our plates, and could have been resolved in a more timely manner,  but were fixed eventually. They accidentally offered our dishes to another table, but fortunately this was resolved before the dinners were served so it did not cause much inconvenience or delay.  This issue was not a surprise because I've noticed that every Applebees appears to have quite a high staff turnover rate. I've rarely seen the same employees there on consecutive visits.  I really like how Applebees tries hard to fit into the neighborhood in which they do business. The menu is similar wherever you go, but the decor varies based on location.

I was pretty jealous of the great service they received. They have new software at the tables that assist in ordering food and making payment. I like the computer personally, but I do not expect to give a 20% tip to it. It helps you calculate the tip, and I felt odd leaving my server a large tip for very little customer service.  However, the server behind us definitely deserved one for friendliness.  We ordered the Pretzel Sticks with Beer Cheese Sauce, The All American Burger, a half rack of Chipotle Ribs, and the kids mac and cheese with mozzarella sticks. The pretzels were fried and the cheese sauce tasted just like Gustav's Restaurant fondue. I don't think I would order them again. The burger was not half bad. I liked the consistency of the meat with the bacon, onions and pickles mixed in. I was happy to see some pink in it. The rest of the burger was unremarkable. The ribs were standard for this type of restaurant. The kids mac and cheese was the common kraft clone variety.   I really wouldn't go out of my way for a Applebee's, but it happened to be there, and really is not the worst you can do.

james c.,"Seaside, OR",8,624,1,3.0,10/8/2016,We had not been to this store though we have been to several Applebee's over the years. Service was attentive. Management was visible which is nice. I ordered the Thai shrimp salad which I thought was good. My wife had the Asian chicken salad and was pleased.   The kids tried various drinks and different kinds of food depending on prejudice and past experience.  We had not been to this store before but know the brand is reliable. So did the Rotary exchange kids we were accompanying. It was a good lunch for a fair price.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tualatin-2
Cassie M.,"Sherwood, OR",1,6,,2.0,11/1/2015,"I think I've only been in an Applebee's twice in my life, and now I remember why. Service: decent. The hostess seemed pretty bored, but she was nice enough. Our service was on top of it; my water was always full, additional items asked for were delivered promptly, et centers. Our server was nice enough, but nothing to write home about. Food: the spinach and artichoke dip was alright, I've had better but I've also had worse. I ordered the Clubhouse Grille with no bacon or ham (just turkey and veggies) and sure enough, it was served to me with bacon (sigh). My boyfriend ordered the fish and chips and the fish was SO oily, the tarter sauce wouldn't even stick to the fish! I found a hair on my plate, too. Overall, nothing special. Atmosphere: typical restaurant on a Sunday; lots of football, pretty quiet.  We won't be going back to Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tualatin-2
Mychal M.,"Tualatin, OR",107,5,20,2.0,5/1/2016,"Love me some plain jane Applebee's from time to time. This particular time was not enjoyable though. Friendly service, pretty good food(only come for happy hour) but the soft drinks were totally flat!! I'm not much of a soda drinker but I know how it should taste and this was horrible. This is the place you go to if its the last resort",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tualatin-2
Tricia J.,"Portland, OR",9,34,17,4.0,2/10/2015,I love the new menu with so many More options especially for kids.  We have so many food limitations the new menu let's is order low carb and grain free for the kids.   Had the couple special 2 meals for $25.  Great food tastes good!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tualatin-2
Cheri L.,"Tualatin, OR",190,9,,2.0,7/16/2015,"The food was amazing but the service was not. Reasonable prices for the quality, however, the store was nearly empty and our waitress only checked in with us twice. Also, I had to ask for a refill on water over 40 minutes after I had finished, and we had to wait a half an hour to have her pick up our check. When we looked around, many waitresses and waiters were leaning around the bar chatting instead of doing their jobs. I love Applebee's but I just feel that the staff did a poor job doing their jobs and attending the customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tualatin-2
Casey D.,"Old Town - Chinatown, Portland, OR",13,4,3,1.0,9/28/2015,"Honestly, I didn't have the highest expectations, but me and my friends left assured we would never go back to this location.  Within the first 5 minutes of being there we were asked 3 times if we wanted to order- to which we obviously needed to say no because we didn't know a thing about the menu.. and after it took them probably 10-15 minutes to come back again.  When our server finally came, he seemed very in a rush to take our order- until someone mentioned the margaritas. Suddenly he was VERY talkative to tell us all about how he has sold the second most ""perfect margaritas"" in the district.. which is only because the bartender was first. End of friendliness.  About 5 seconds later of my friends deciding- he repeats their orders as if hurrying us along to leave, almost overlooking me ordering completely.  As it was late at night- happy hour was posted ALL over the building, we all of course ordered appetizers myself getting a couple clearly included in the half off deal.  About 10 minutes later we get our food and my friends who ordered exactly the same thing got twice as much food in their servings.  When we asked what was going on- he told me I clearly ordered the full price ""sampler combo"" which was absolutely not the case. Never was the word sampler used, never did I point that out somewhere, etc. He continued to argue that I had apparently pointed to something that made him think I wanted the option that would get me literally half as much food and pay a dollar more- and this NEVER made him think maybe he should point out the deal I could get or ask to clarify.  Instead of just clearing up the mistake, he continued to argue until my friend just simply asked him to bring the remaining food I wanted and was going to pay for.  Another 10 minutes later he brought the rest of the food, set it down without saying anything, walked away and never said anything to us again. We paid at the table side payment machine and never saw him again.  Again, I didn't have the highest expectations for an Applebees at the end of the night- but this server was unprofessional, rude and made us all feel uncomfortable. None of us are the types to complain in restaurants- but 4 of us could clearly see his argument for what he did was faulty and downright deceptive.  Server aside- it was also freezing to the point where we were all wearing coats and sitting close to each other to stay warm. They clearly didn't want people to stay around any longer, or deal with us any more than they absolutely had to.  I will absolutely not go back to this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tualatin-2
