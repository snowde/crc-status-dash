Gaby T.,"Tupelo, MS",0,13,7,4.0,10/26/2017,"This is one of my favorite restaurants because of the great food and atmosphere. The staff is usually okay, sometimes they're nice sometimes they're rude. When we entered we stood at the host station for a long time & almost left. Our server this past time was great. The only thing I would advise is to not use the restroom while you're there, it's disgusting!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tupelo-3
Preston W.,"City Center, CO",4,99,94,3.0,10/15/2017,"Eh, it was ok...not great, but not terrible. I haven't been to an Applebee's in years but one of my guys wanted to go after work. Service was lackluster. We got one of those 2 for $20 deals because we actually wanted things that were both on that menu. That is acutally a pretty good deal. The regular items were $14 a piece. Plus you get an appetizer. So basically we saved $8 then got a free appetizer. Not a bad deal. I got the Cajun Chicken and Shrimp which was actually pretty good. For an appetizer we got the chicken wings. They were honestly pretty mediocre. They tasted like they were microwaved in a bag. In the future I'd rather hit the local places instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tupelo-3
Richard S.,"Denton, TX",18,135,529,3.0,9/27/2016,"We dropped in here for lunch right after noon on a Tuesday. The place was decently crowded but there were a good amount of tables available.   The receptionist was not friendly at all and was very terse. He first attempted to sit us in the bar area even though we had a 10-year-old girl with us. I pointed out an empty booth and asked if we could sit there and he agreed but he was obviously annoyed.  However, our server was very friendly.  He was very personable and he made sure to understand our order.   The food was OK.  I ordered a 6oz sirlion cooked medium rare with broccoli and a side salad. The broccoli was good but a small portion. The side salad was also extremely small. The sirlion was cooked at least medium WELL even though I request medium rare. Table partners order the beer burger, sweet potato fries and a wedge salad. Sweet Potato fries were very good but typical. The wedge salad was good and had some really good dressing with blue cheese chunks but gosh it was drenched in the dressing. The burger was very good but it was very light on toppings compared to our expectation from  reading the menu description. Overall, this place was OK. The nice server is what tipped this review to the positive side. Otherwise, the food was just mediocre and the price was not a very good value for the portions.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tupelo-3
Alan M.,"Farmington, NH",4,14,2,5.0,5/20/2016,Wonderful service. We had about 10 family and friends show up after another restaurant wasn't open. The waitress handle our orders and drinks like she had only 2 customers. Clean restaurant with very nice host staff. I love that they reserve veterans parking space.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tupelo-3
Shanna L.,"Saltillo, MS",0,19,11,5.0,8/6/2015,"Hubby had the beer pub Philly cheese (and I had to have a bite) and it was awesome. I got the Classic-Classic lunch combo: Thai shrimp salad and tomato-basil soup. They were both great, but the soup was just amazing. Creamy and not too acidic. Our server was Jessica and I have to say, she worked behind the bar and was still very attentive and helpful to all of her tables. We will definitely sit near her in the future! We had two managers (maybe one was district?) check in on us several times. Overall, best ever visit to any Applebee's - including Oxford and several in Mobile, AL. Will DEFINITELY be returning!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tupelo-3
Tom J.,"Port Orange, FL",0,58,,2.0,12/22/2014,Great service but average food.  The girls serving and at the bar were always fooling with their hair then make a drink or serve food. Not good!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tupelo-3
Malcolm M.,"Saltillo, MS",1,18,4,4.0,4/25/2010,"Seated quickly, service good. I had new menu item, Grilled Dijon Chicken & Portobellos and it was very good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tupelo-3
Crystal P.,"Dennis, MS",0,6,,1.0,2/7/2011,"I had bad luck here once, but we gave it one more try.  The food was cold, fries were bad. We had a wait to be seated, which wasn't unexpected, but the fifteen minutes to be waited on and then the hour to get our food was ridiculous. Come on, Applebee's you can do better!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tupelo-3
