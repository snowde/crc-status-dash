Chris B.,"Brea, CA",54,110,33,4.0,12/5/2017,"Like others say, this is an Applebee's, not fine dining.  That all said, the family and I were on a vacation and stopped in town for the night.  We settled on this spot, stumbling distance from our hotel, and weren't disappointed.  Everything we ordered came as expected; what really set the place apart was the service.  They went above and beyond to make sure we had a pleasant dinner, and once one of the kids spilled something immediately remedied and replaced. Sure seems in reading recent reviews that our experience was an isolated incident, unfortunately, so here's a positive review to bring the average back up a bit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ukiah-2
Monique S.,"Ukiah, CA",2,37,2,1.0,10/19/2017,":(  Oh Applebees. We came here because we had a gift card and decided to try it out again. We ordered 2 appetizers and 2 meals. The appetizers were actually ok, especially the spinach/artichoke dip, but oh man - the rest of the food was just bad. The macaroni and cheese with chicken tenders sounded great, but the bottom of my bowl was covered in oil? It was all wet and just gross. I didn't eat more than three bites. My husband's food was cold and bland.  We are super disappointed, because we did have some great service and the place was nice and clean.  :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ukiah-2
Maxx M.,"Minneapolis, MN",17,413,2047,4.0,8/2/2017,"I have to bump these guys up to 4 stars. Okay, this is an Applebee's.  They're a national chain.  This isn't fine dining.  But I've been a guest here many times now and I have to admit that overall, they're remarkably consistent with good food and good customer service. My most recent experience was lunch with my daughter.  Again, the food was good.  It came out fast and hot.  And the customer service was very good. Applebee's is also one of your only options for late night dining that isn't some sort of fast food or a truck stop. -Daddy Maxx Retro",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ukiah-2

Marie B.,"Santa Rosa, CA",40,108,27,3.0,7/7/2017,"Apparently LILY that works here is pro animal abuse.  The food was fantastic - the hostess named Lily that works here and condones animal abuse could be done without.  Let's set the scene - 96 degrees outside in the lovely town of Ukiah. We pull into the parking lot and see a ratty Dodge truck parked in DIRECT sun with a long coat German Shepard god tied in the back. No shade. No water. Panting and lethargic.  Come inside, immediately tell the hostess Lily that there is a dog outside in distress. She says 'yeah some people have told us that'. We asked Lily what the restraint was going to do, had the police been called and she just gave us a blank stare and ignored us while taking the couple ahead of us to their seats.  We sat at the bar and I WATCHED Lily walk up to a table that appeared to be her friends and let them know that we had called animal control. The woman  who owned the dog seated at the table proceeded to confront my friend and I at the bar, stating 'my dog has 2 jugs of water with her'. Uummmm the jugs of water are sealed. Does your dog have thumbs?! If not, the dog most likely would struggle with pouring itself some water.  Once Lily alerted the couple with their infant that the police had been called the hurried out to beat the police. Lily made sure to hug them on their way out the door.  For the rest of our meal Lily proceeded to glare at us and gossip to other employees that we were concerned about the dog. My bad, animals shouldn't cook to death in the bed of some idiots truck.  If you were anything of a decent person Lily, you would have alerted your manager right away and animal control would have already been on the scene but heaven forbid you worry about animals instead of your idiot friends.

It was the usual Applebee chain and was quite empty probably due to it was just after Thanksgiving. We were promptly seated and were approached by a seemingly not interested waitress who took our drink orders and  upon returning took our orders. I had the sirloin steak ( asked for med. rare and it was medium) with red potatoes and my bride and I each had a house salad served on a warm plate.

It's Applebees so it's pretty much always the same. They've had worse cooks at this location.  Service was very sloooow. Our waitress was very absent. She was nice and pleasant though. Just very no where. I have to say that there was a young man named ""Austin"" who was basically taking care of everyone all night. Like he was doing this waitresses job x2.

Jennifer H.,"Folsom, CA",30,88,45,1.0,5/9/2016,"Super disappointed. I wanted something walking distance from my hotel. I tried the beef on potatoes, which said it was new. The onion rings on top weren't edible due to so much grease. The sauce covering most of the dish wasn't edible due to salt. So I gingerly picked out the meat (which was overlooked yet somehow cold, as were the tomatoes) and scooped off the gravy to get to the potatoes which much to surprise were nuclear hot and I burnt my mouth. The waitress didn't seem that it was strange that I didn't eat 80% of it. Aside from the food, the table was sticky and covered in grime. I don't think a thorough cleaning had been done recently.

Mike R.,"Sparks, NV",6,40,2,2.0,10/16/2016,Typical Applebees. I've never been to a good one. Came here because it was a rainy Sunday night and it was located across the street from my hotel. Chose it entirely on the convenient factor. I sat at the bar and decided not to order based on what I saw on people's plates sitting around me. Looked like TV dinners that had been reheated 4 or 5 times. Gross.

The ""beers on tap"" list is not up to date even though it's hand written. The hostess just keeps walking by looking confused, but I guess, at least she is finally on the floor. ... And hour and 15 minutes in since we got here, still no entrees.. the only reason this is even getting a second star is because the manager felt bad about making us wait  so long for our food and he comped the most expensive item.  And was trying to do everyone else's jobs when they couldn't be found.  The manager was the only person we were impressed with.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ukiah-2

J O.,"Ukiah, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/1/2016,"This place is the most disgusting excuse for a restaurant EVER!  Luckily we had a gift card and it didn't cost us anything. The waiter (maybe 15 yrs old) seated us in a booth and both seats were covered in dry dirt/mud. We had to move to another disgusting,  dirty as filth can be, booth. Sat there for literally 10 mins before anyone even looked at us. I asked another waiter (probably 16 yrs old) if we were ever going to get served sometime today? He apologized and said our waitress is learning how to do things. I didn't see anyone training her which leads me to believe she just had to fend for herself. My wife asked what kind of salad dressing they have and the waitress started explaining what a salad consists of. WHAT? ? ! Omg...it gets worse. The seats have a line of black greasy grime at the top of them due to never being cleaned, the windows had little kid hand prints all over them, the blinds were covered in dried spills and splashes and dust, the table was like fly paper it was so sticky! The utensils were very spotted and dirty looking, and the water glasses had greasy finger prints all around the rims. After our fine salad, which consisted of a thimble full of dressing (probably the most expense on a salad) we were served our lime chicken fiesta which consisted of about a 2 oz piece of chicken with about 1 cup of rice. Wow!.... Thank god it didn't cost us anything! Never give an Applebees gift card to anyone. I keep trying to give this place a chance but no more.

Abe F.,"Yolo, CA",0,9,,1.0,10/14/2010,"Oddly, I had never eaten at an Applebee's prior - I probably will refrain from ever doing so again (as harsh as that may sound). The atmosphere, ambiance, and environment, all equated to similar casual dining chain restaurants (i.e. Ruby Tuesday, T.G.I. Friday's, Outback Steakhouse, etc.). However, at this particular location, there were two very apparent differences that separated it from the aforementioned: 1. Food 2. Service I will begin with the food. I ordered a regular hamburger and fries, which were not appetizing at all and were both rather tasteless. In fact, it was probably the worst food (flavor-wise) that I have ever had at a restaurant that serves moderately priced food in a casual atmosphere. Now I will address the service (which coincides with number 1). The waitress (Hilary F.) was, well... to put it simply, rather rude. I did not see a ""regular"" hamburger anywhere on the menu (which is what I desired), and so I asked Hilary if one was available. Hilary's response: ""You mean like without cheese?"" Me: ""Yes."" Hilary: ""Yeah, if that's how you want it (followed by a weird look on her face - as if no one would ever order a hamburger without cheese). Would you like it pink?"" Me: Well, done please. Hilary: Is there anything else I can get you tonight? Me:  May I ask what else comes on the burger? Hilary: (Sarcastic tone) Well, you asked for no cheese so what else would be on it? (Sarcastic chuckle and eyes to the side) Me: (Taken aback by such a response and thinking to myself, ""What the? Is it just I, or was that rude? Hmmm."") Hilary: (Makes weird face) Well since you don't want cheese... Dinner Date: (Chiming in) What kind of sauce... ketchup, mustard, mayo? Me: (Clearing my throat and looking at Hilary) Ummm... do you realize who I am by chance? Recognize me at all? Hilary: You're Abe Froman? Me: That's right, I'm Abe Froman. Hilary: The Sausage King of Sacramento? Me: [caught off-guard]... Uh yeah, that's me. Hilary: Look, I'm very busy. Why don't you take the kids and go back to the clubhouse? Me: Are you suggesting that I'm not who I say I am? Hilary: I'm suggesting that you leave before I have to get snooty. Me: Snooty? Hilary: Snotty. Me: Snotty? (*Disclaimer: Okay, so that last part beginning with me clearing my throat was actually taken from the classic 80's film ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" and did not really happen... but hey, that is what it felt like being in Hilary's presence. Everything above that part did indeed play out exactly as conveyed) CONTINUED:  Hilary goes on to say that she could bring the abovementioned on the side - she never did. I ate the burger dry, as she would literally ask if everything was okay and if we needed anything only while hurriedly walking past - and she only did ask if we needed something once (possibly twice) during the entire course of our meal.  I am not certain what the problem was, but she seemed very confused, impolite, and unaccommodating. I could not figure it out, as I was just as kind and respectful as I always am to others. Though I had limited communication with the rest of the staff, the one or two that I did interact with seemed fine. Perhaps others may have a completely different experience than I did (I hope so), but I personally would not patronize this Applebee's location again and probably would not recommend it to anyone else. Its location is convenient; however there are plenty of other (i.e. better) options just a short drive away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ukiah-2?start=60
Matthew H.,"Eureka, CA",7,4,,1.0,4/18/2015,"If I could post a review with zero stars, that would be my choice. In general, we have had good luck with this chain restaurant, and have found it to be reliable at different locations. The Ukiah, Ca. location was the exception. We ordered items that we have eaten before: steaks, pasta, salad, quesadilla's, and were expecting that again. We ordered car side to go, which wasn't available for some reason at 8:43pm, so we had to wait inside the restaurant since they the server told us that wasn't available Saturday night, which seemed odd. When we got back to hotel, tired and hungry with kids after a very long drive, we were shocked. The food was horrible. Some of what we ordered was completely the wrong food, the steak that was supposed to be medium well was dripping blood inside the package, the pasta tasted like fake macaroni and cheese, salads were barely anything but iceberg lettuce, and the baked potato was just a warm potato tossed in for show. We barely ate anything, but were too tired to go complain to the manager.

Baylee C.,"Encinitas, CA",167,98,41,3.0,9/10/2010,"I just moved to Ukiah and was looking for dinner. This was honestly the only recognizable non ""fast food"" chain I found, even though I am not known to eat at such chains, it felt like a safe bet for a decent meal. So we pulled up, and it looked a little busy inside. My boyfriend went in to grab a curbside to go menu from the hostess. When he asked, she responded ""here, I don't even care,"" and handed him a sit down menu to take. So then from the parking lot, we called in our order. We got the pick your own 3 appetizer plate, an the 2 for 20 meal deal. The girl on the phone was very pleasant, making up for the lack of kindness the hostess had shown. We then returned 25 minutes later, which they were on time with our food, and unlike others experiences, ours was accurate. The only weird thing was the girl delivering curbside was not in any sort of proper uniform, but instead a ""play-dough"" t-shirt. Overall, the food was fine. The towering steak quesadillas get a thumbs down because they look nothing like the picture, and the boneless buffalo wings were honestly better the next day, but everything else was good, and my steak was actually medium rare as I had asked.

Monica S.,"Ukiah, CA",21,3,,1.0,4/23/2014,"ZERO STARS!! I will not eat at ANY Applebees after my horribly rushed lunch today. Within 3 MINUTES of sitting down, our server (toe-head blond with tattoo's covering her left arm) approached our table FIVE TIMES to say, 'not trying to rush you, but are you ready to order yet'. I hadn't even OPENED my menu the first time and was trying to enjoy a luncheon conversation with my husband. The last time she came to the table, I just pointed at something on the menu and said, 'Fine. I'll just take whatever this is' and she said OK and walked away. It was not what I wanted to order but she was OBVIOUSLY not going to let me look at my menu before deciding. The restaurant was not busy and there were several other employees working, so there was NO excuse to treat us like this. My husband and I frequently eat out and will definitely AVOID Applebees from here on out. She was so extremely rude that I hope she gets fired so no one else has to feel that rushed and forced to eat food they didn't even want. We paid over $50 to be treated like SHIT that was sitting in someone else's way and wasn't leaving fast enough. There were PLENTY of empty tables - was she just trying to make sure she pocketed the tip before her shift was over? NO, she SAID she was rushing us because she wanted to get our order in before another server got their 'big' (8 people I think) order in. I should have a CHOICE of when I order.

Clarke J.,"Vallejo, CA",47,114,1,1.0,12/31/2015,"Spotted silverware that's fairly ugly looking, perhpas the worst I've ever seen at a chain. Either the rinse isn't hot enough, or they're not running enough soap . . either way; one has to ponder things like sterilization, germs and you. Table-tops aren't much better, often sticky, food bits. But here's the new rub: Their nifty littke screen gizmo, which is supposed to be the new Point of Service for your mobile payment . . this thing asks you questions about classic cars and what not . . and then you get $1.99 added to your bill for playing games? There was NO screen indicating a charge or fee for service or product. Let me say that again: There was no accept/decline fee for use. I would say at this point that Applebees is raking significant extra $$ without customers not even feeling the three or four dollar padding that's being done. A good attorney could make legal hay against the chain for non-disclosure, I'd guess. We got our money back after complaining. No big deal if the food had been good! But it wasn't. Caesar salad was dry, pieces cut huge. (Grade C-)  What looked entertaining on the menu: Applebees ""Loaded Brisket Enchilada"" supposedly errupting with seasoned beef, covered in green sauce, garnished with sour cream and Jalapeno slices. Reality? Barely detectable meat portion. Miniscule comes to mind. Ended up being a glop of wet rolled flour tortillas, drenched in green sauce, sour cream as shown with hot pepper slices, and some pretty poor version of what should've been some tasty cheese . .  and a big 'ol pile of rice. (Grade D) $13.99 for a plate that no self-respecting Taquiera would EVER send out of the kitchen. Didn't even bother with a ""to-go"" bag. This location needs a management level shake-up. Can't imagine whoever is invested here being happy with the product, or their bottom line. I always thought that it was Chili's or TGIFriday's that might suffer on the national scene, but I could be wrong. With my wifes' Fiesta Lime chicken, two lemonades . . it came to $38+.

When I asked for more cheddar cheese our waitress brought me back a bowl of hot gooey spicy assortment of some form of rubber. My brother ordered the steak, 75% of it was fat and inedible.

Jeff R.,"Natomas, Sacramento, CA",47,134,59,1.0,4/7/2014,"I would absolutely give 0 stars if Yelp allowed it, I hate Applebee's to begin with and this location did nothing to try and change the perception of this poorly run restaurant chain.  I decided to eat here based solely on its proximity to my hotel (walking distance) and the fact I recognized the brand name and you can mostly count on getting average food pretty quickly.  I will give them credit for 1 thing; we were greeted promptly and seated immediately, it's all down hill from this point. First issue is that the bartender (Stephanie G) was not interested in delivering service and rudely signaled to the hostess to find out our drink order after she noticed us get seated at a high back table in the bar area.  Simple order of Diet soda and Blue Moon beer, soda was quick, beer took almost ten minutes.  Despite the restaurant being far from capacity, 10 minutes for a beer is pretty ridiculous.  By the time Stephanie came over to our table we were ready to order, again simple order of two sandwiches and fries.  Apparently too complicated for this place.  Received appetizer and salad after about 15 minutes and finished my beer waiting for entrees.  After more than 15 minutes with an empty glass, Stephanie took time away from her friends at the bar to inquire about a second beer, I asked about the food and was told it was on the way.  She brought a second round and we waited an additional 10 minutes before our food arrived.  Stephanie said she would wait until 9:00 to ring the beer so she could save me $3, how thoughtful...only problem is I would have paid more just to get service and prompt food delivery.  I would avoid this place like the plague, food is just average but the service is a complete joke!!  If you are a local with tattoos all over your neck and arms and know the bartender, you will be treated like royalty and get personalized service and great conversation.  If you are a businessman from out of town, forget it!  Ironically the businessman is going to tip significantly more for great service while the tattooed local is not!  It's pretty clear this location doesn't care and obviously doesn't read their Yelp reviews or things would change.  I will never return and will let all of my co-workers who travel here for business to stay away as well.  Maybe some day when I'm broke, covered in tattoos, and trying to get into the bartender's pants I will return since I'm guaranteed stellar service....and I won't have to tip!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ukiah-2?start=40

After washing his hands the automatic towel dispenser had the towel roll improperly installed so he had to come back with wet hands.  Thankfully our assigned wait person was busy cashing out a large party that wanted separate checks and asked Pristina to take us. Pristina was so professional & personable in the chaos inside. Once she had permission to help us, things began to happen. For drinks we ordered 1 coffee,  1 root beer & 2 beers. Pristina asked the bartender 3 separate times when our beers would be ready. By the time they arrived the one drinking coffee had almost finished his second cup.  When our meals arrived 1 over cooked steak, 1 side of cold fries, 1 burger sans bacon and jalapeño missing from the fourth.  The meals Pristina brought out she caught the obvious mistakes.  Her ""helpers"" just made more work for her to correct.

After our waitress took our drink order and we looked at the menu we decided on 2 appetizers and 2 entrees. The waitress brought back the drinks, forgetting the water. She mentions that she will be back with the water. She promptly forgets this, and serves two other tables water. I had to flag her down twice and ask her to refill the drinks. The appetizers came out and we ate them. The waitress came back to the table well after we were finished and asked if we wanted more chips with our spinach dip (which was gone.) We said no. At this point, three other tables that came in well after us have gotten their dinners. One has actually finished and LEFT ALREADY. The waitress took away the appetizer plates. We have now been at this establishment for an hour, and our entrees are nowhere to be seen. At this point two other tables are upset because one hasn't had their order taken after 20 minutes, and the other had some kind of issue with the food. Both tables requested the manager, and one left very angrily. The waitress ignores us for another 15 minutes. She finally comes back to the table, after we have been there for nearly an hour and a half and says that ""the kitchen messed up on your wrap, and the tag got 'bumped' so they are starting your food now."" I tell her that I want her to cancel the food, and bring us the check for the appetizers we have already eaten. This is not the first time the service in this establishment has been EXTREMELY SLOW. The waitress was also RUDE and inattentive. We live an hour and a half away, and could have been home in the time it took for us to NOT GET OUR FOOD.

Its actually a decent place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ukiah-2?start=20
Rebekah B.,"Pleasanton, CA",19,163,22,3.0,9/4/2013,"Oh, yikes!  I feel badly leaving this review because the waitress Yesica was so nice and very good. Actually the stars are her and the Hostess.  The manager stopped by after he heard that I was unhappy.  I do not complain about the service at all!  They were great.   But, the food?  Oh my. I had the weight watchers chicken breast with sautéed spinach (came raw) and Rice.   Rather lacking, flavor, presentation.  But the mashed potatoes I got on the side? We're awesome  Give them a try, but just be honest with staff, if your not happy. Even if your not happy tip your server appropriately.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ukiah-2?start=20
Andrew T.,"Ukiah, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/3/2016,"Yeaaaaa, pretty much the worst.  Bad service, and worse food.  Although to be fair you might get lucky going there, you never know.  I however won't be back, unless they make it free.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ukiah-2?start=20
Alyse L.,"Willits, CA",20,100,30,2.0,7/10/2015,"You would think ordering appetizers would mean you would get it before your meal... Sadly no! We were talked into an app and it did not even hit the table until AFTER our main dishes were sitting in front of us! Now if that was not enough it was a slow day, under 10 tables eating at the time and the food took over 45 minutes, and one of the plates was a salad. Cherry on top: it was even underdressed... Get your act together guys! With 'decent' food it could be an okay place to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ukiah-2?start=20
D T.,"Elko, NV",0,7,,1.0,9/11/2016,"Worst place I have experienced in a long time. Only a hand full of people eating, and took them over an hour to finally serve food. The food was horrible and we still received a $70.00 bill. I will never eat at the establishment again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ukiah-2?start=20
Fidelity W.,"Kelseyville, CA",0,32,,1.0,3/5/2017,"I've always enjoyed going to Applebee's until recently.  My husband and I took our baby daughters there today and I have to say, it will be the last time.  Our server spent most of his time hanging out at the bar, chit chatting it up with other patrons and servers.  We had to ask for napkins and silverware because he was too busy wandering around doing nothing to see to our needs.  We were his only customer in our section.  On top of that, my hash browns were burned, my husband's chicken was also and our fries were cold.  The hostess brought us a booster seat for our daughter that didn't have a strap to hold her in with, and the second one she brought us didn't strap to the chair.  We asked our server for a high chair but that never came.  My husband had to go get it himself.  It appeared that the manager was a very nice, pretty pregnant woman...she spent more time with us than our server.  I would have written a 4 star review if she had been assigned to us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ukiah-2?start=20
Freya M.,"Kelseyville, CA",0,4,,1.0,2/27/2016,Service is horrible!!!!!! Hire new waitresses! You have great food but seriously terrible service. We used to come there regularly but now you have to wait 25 min for someone to even take a drink order! Please please hire new waitresses and we will bring back our business along with many friends.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ukiah-2?start=20
Maricarmen E.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,4,,1.0,8/5/2016,"This was the WORST dinning experience I've ever had!!! It first took our waiter at least 25 minutes to ask us what we wanted to drink then brought us wrong drinks. THEN, when we finally order our food, it WASN'T EVEN COOKED well!!!!! Then a whole bunch of young men sat next to us (my mother and little sisters) and were so loud and cursing like sailors!! Received no service at all and terrible food and terrible ambiance!!! Will most certainly NOT be going back again!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ukiah-2?start=20
Stanley D.,"Sequim, WA",17,15,2,5.0,11/2/2015,Sitting at the bar Monday through Thursday with Donna as hostest. Is the best. Food is always good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ukiah-2?start=20
Jan S.,"San Francisco, CA",32,14,124,3.0,4/23/2013,"...this applebee is the first place that I found to be pretty quiet and peaceful specially coming from an applebee...most applebee I been to is pretty alive and loud cause there were many things going on, like questionnaire where servers ask you questions for a contest or just having music playing... I like the theme of the place cause it brings me back to high school since most of the decorations are from Ukiah high school, which I didn't know they had a high school...the place is not too busy which is a good thing so the food service is pretty fast...the waiter was really friendly, he even complimented how nice my phone was...food is alright nothing special i don't mind going to this place again since its pretty much the only sit-in restaurant that is open late around that place other than Denny's...overall if you like a peaceful night then this is the place to be...

Chuy E.,"Stockton, CA",21,192,30,1.0,7/28/2015,Never been to an Applebee's that was this slow. I learned my lesson and will never come here again. The staff seems to relax and will forget about you once you order.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ukiah-2?start=20
Joe S.,"San Francisco, CA",6,182,5,3.0,7/17/2015,"Applebee's is no gourmet restaurant, but this one is better than the ones in the Bay Area.  Generous portions and decent food.  Very American.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ukiah-2?start=20
Jessica W.,"Cloverdale, CA",58,6,,1.0,10/9/2015,"First, let me start by saying that I LOVE Applebee's. I have a great experience at every single one I go to however, this one was the exception. After walking in I immediately realize that it was close to 50 degrees in the dining room so I was shivering through my meal. But not only was the atmosphere cold, our appetizer and my pasta was as well. The manager/supervisor or whomever took the wings back to the kitchen after we let her know they were cold was pretty rude about it (didn't apologize) and just brought the wings back microwaved with an extra side of barbecue sauce. Then my pasta was cold with barely any sauce and it wasn't cooked all the way through. This restaurants only saving grace was the waitress who was very pleasant and sweet and gave us a $5 discount for our troubles.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ukiah-2?start=20
Carl G.,"Ukiah, CA",0,2,1,1.0,5/11/2014,"My fiance and I called ahead to see about their hours, and were told they would be open until 12. We walked in at 10:30, the door was unlocked, and people inside were being served. But the manager looked at us with a smile on her face and refused to serve us, saying they were closed.  I'm not sure if we were discriminated against for being an interracial couple or if they just decided to close early because business was closed, but this restaurant's service stinks so bad it would knock a buzzards off a shit wagon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ukiah-2?start=20
