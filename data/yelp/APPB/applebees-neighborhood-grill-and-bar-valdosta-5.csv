Patti K.,"Lakewood Ranch, FL",251,212,250,5.0,7/30/2014,This Apple Bees was just remodeled. It's beautiful! Our waitress was amazing and made sure we were taken care of. It's a clean and friendly atmosphere. I ordered the Three Cheese Chicken Penne Four Cheese Mac & Cheese. Glad we stopped in. The food was EXCELLENT! I could have used a wheel barrel to haul me out I ate so much!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-valdosta-5?start=20
Christopher C.,"Jacksonville, FL",13,21,1,1.0,12/19/2015,Where to start...15 minutes to get drinks....45 minutes to get food..... food was awful. I wasn't expecting gourmet as it is Applebee's but palatable would have been nice.  My sandwich was missing half of the menu toppings and was luke warm. my 4 y/O had cold mac n cheese. I guess I deserve it since I should know better than go to a shi××y chain restaurant. Fritos back in the hotel were tasty though,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-valdosta-5?start=20
Stephanie W.,"Homerville, GA",0,4,,2.0,12/30/2015,"As soon as we walked in, there was no one to greet or seat us. A waitresses that had no idea where to take us, had to do it. It took 15 minutes just to get drinks. Our waitress was also bartending. It was very unorganized. The food was bearable. I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-valdosta-5?start=20
Justin I.,"Valdosta, GA",0,62,,1.0,3/4/2016,"What a total shit show.  Having been forced to go to Applebee's by my SO who seems to like the joint, we first  attempted to go to the one on the other side of town. However after being told it would be a 30 minute wait even with half the restaurant empty I was forced to drive across town to this one because ""If Mama ain't happy...."".   So after dodging the Sunday Drivers, Fast and Bi-Curious, and small penis jacked up Daddy owns it trucks we get to the restaurant.  Walk in and no hostess..no greeting. Finally after 10 minutes she walks over and says she will clean a table for us (1/3rd of the place was empty). When she returned she was approached by some Mumford and Son's Hipster guy who we assumed was a manager. We overheard him tell the hostess to not seat us for another 20 minutes because the kitchen can't handle it. The Hostess made a loud guffaw and walked off from us, didn't even relay the message.  A few minutes later a large group of people passed us and told us they had been there an hour and a half with no service.  We decided to take our leave and in total I believe I counted 15 people leave in the span of 2 minutes.   Read all the other reviews folks, there is a reason this place has earned it's bad rep.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-valdosta-5?start=20
Shauna C.,"Valdosta, GA",0,4,,1.0,4/21/2015,"Even a one star review is hard to give for this location. We have a favorite waitress but that's about it. My friends and I occasionally go after work and if we don't get our favorite waitress we have HORRIBLE service. The hostesses seem to hate their jobs, as do most people at this location. The food isn't always horrible, but the bad service always outweighs the positives.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-valdosta-5?start=20
C G.,"Valdosta, GA",0,5,,5.0,5/26/2016,Ashley one of the waitresses there is absolutely the best service I've ever witnessed!

Andi A.,"Palm Bay, FL",22,29,2,1.0,12/28/2015,"Out of desperation to find a patio off of I75 I decide to roll the dice and go to Applebee's Bc the porch looked new and my baby is a holy terror inside. If I could give it two different reviews I would. One for the food which was excellent. Hot where it's supposed to be, cold where it's fresh and crispy, and flavored correctly. AND delivered in a timely fashion. So, 5 stars to the kitchen and if I hadn't been with a 6 month old baby I probably would have made time to tip the kitchen, since there was no way in hell I was tipping anyone else in that place. The second review-the 1 star is for the complete lack of service from start to finish at this sorry excuse for a restaurant. My husband and my 6 month baby get seated by a manager outside and the waiting begins. 3 people walk in and out past us, nothing. I go inside and stand back at the host stand for 5 minutes, not one person stops to speak to me, even the manager who sat us! I go to the bar and ask to order my food there. She says sure. So I order my food and drinks, serve them to myself, pay the full tab. Leave before anyone says another word to us. The manager walks right by the table and said nothing although she was 100%aware of the oversight. It was her who dropped the ball and didn't tell anyone they had a table and she didn't even make it right. So, 0 stars for 0 service",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-valdosta-5?start=20
Mike O.,"Tampa, FL",0,7,,2.0,4/11/2016,"Wow.  Took 15 minutes to order 3 beers and 4 waters.  One water still never showed up.  There is a full time host busy reading his txt messages while there is no bartender and servers are totally confused.   I don't know how they can still be in business.  When we ordered an appetizer, the plates showed after we finished.  They were completely out of 2 beers that are on the menu.  However they had Miller Lite but the keg was skunked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-valdosta-5?start=20
Lance B.,"South Park, Charlotte, NC",0,5,,2.0,11/7/2015,"Food was just ok chain restaurant style. A large group of loud ladies seemed to have the wait staff's attention.

Andrew S.,"Atlanta, GA",1,10,,3.0,5/19/2013,"Why would anyone come to Applebees in Valdosta?  An economist's answer: ""There are no better alternatives given the avaliable substitues."" A foodie's answer:  ""Man, this grilled jalapeño-lime shrimp is bland and oversauced. Who would ever come here? Excuse me, single-mother-of-two can I have my twelve bucks back?"" A Valdostan's (likely) answer: ""Cuz them wings is good and them Dawg's is 'awn y'all"" My answer: ""Because Shock Top is two for one, my friends are two hours behind on our trip to the Keys, San Antonio is in the playoffs, and I am not lecherous enough to watch the game at the Hooters across the street.""

So last weekend being back home, we ask decided to meet there, it had been remodeled so decided to give it another shot. Nope, nothing has changed. The server was lacking training, the food was terrible, plus a roach ran across our table. Fazolis down the road would have been a lot better and cheaper.

Matthew L.,"Smyrna, GA",10,368,26,3.0,11/13/2012,"Let's face it.  You don't go to Applebee's because you're craving an awesome meal.  Food is mediocre at best and when you add tax and tip, you're money is almost always better spent elsewhere. That being said, if you can take advantage of the specials, it may be worth a visit.  The deals vary depending on the location but you can expect there to be drink specials and deals on appetizers throughout the week.  Monday night was 39 cent wing night with $5.99 domestic 50 oz pitchers.  That's $1.50 a beer--hard to beat.  The traditional wings are a little dry but the boneless are pretty good.  The rest of the week features 1/2 price apps after 10p and a bunch of ladies night specials on Wednesdays.   Service was pretty slow.  Bartender seemed to know what he was doing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-valdosta-5?start=20
Lillian P.,"Anchorage, AK",29,14,49,1.0,5/1/2014,"When the waiter was asked how he was doing he said that the management was pissing him off. I was dinning with a child and found this extremely inappropriate. The plates were dirty that our food came out on, my sandwich the turkey bacon avocado had cold slimy old turkey on it. The kids chicken tenders were over cooked and almost burnt.  Not good.

Heath E.,"Valdosta, GA",7,2,1,1.0,5/8/2015,"Ok, to start with, I should only blame myself for going to an Applebee's in the first place. Now that's out of the way, HOLY HELL! So it's Friday night and I'm just leaving my job that crushes my soul on the daily. I'm also not 100% sure that I wasnt still hungover from the night before of drinking my self into oblivion whilst watching the ever increasing disappointment that was the UK General Election. But that another story for another site. So I walk into this ""resuraunt"" and find that, like Gremlins, you shouldnt fuck with them after midnight. This trying-so-hard-to-be-hip-and-relevent establishment seemingly turns into a f*cking night club after 10pm. So I shake off the dead eyed hostess and sit at the bar like any grown adult. This is where things get hairy. I have 2 d*cks to the left of my scream to each other how great the end of the new Avengers movie was. I was planning on seeing this movie on my day off tomorrow but now I can save the 20 f*cking bucks since these c*nts ruined the ending. I order a 6 dollar 2 for 1 12oz draft (some deal huh?) and a half priced appetizer. It was bland and not at all what was represented in the menu. I choke down that deep fried boot that was placed in front of me and finished my two beers as fast as possible. All the while this is going on, I have 2 slack-jawed mouth breathers to my right waxing poetic about their time touring with Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa. These two are probably about 25ish, white, and sound like the most hickish pecker woods you'd ever encounter in the deepest depths of of a Deliverance fever dream. Now it comes time to pay my tab and get the hell out of their and back to my home so I can drink in peace and quiet. The gruff (putting it nicely) bartender brings me my tab and the app is FULL GOD DAMN PRICE! She then proceeds to tell me that she put in a double order since they were half off anyway. There is one small problem with that... IT WASNT HER FUCKING CALL! She tries to argue the point but I wasnt drunk enough to care and threw down the 13 dollars I owed and got away from that hell hole of an establishment as fast as my chubby self could waddle. In closing, fuck this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-valdosta-5?start=20

Melissa H.,"Chicago, IL",58,63,2,3.0,11/23/2008,"WTF, right? A Yelp review of an Applebee's?   Bear with me!   I recently took a road trip from Chicago to Ft. Myers Beach, Florida and one of my overnight stops along the way was in Valdosta, Georgia.  I'd been eating crappy drive through food for the entire trip and really just wanted someplace that had a bar I could sit down at, order a few cocktails and eat something that didn't come out of a paper bag. Hence, Applebee's.  It was right across the street from my hotel :uberconvienant after sitting behind the wheel of a car for 10 hours: and they had an open bar. Score! Jeremy was my bartender.  Can't believe I remember his name? That's how awesome he was.  Friendly, but not overly so.  Heavy handed, but in a respectable corporate owned restaurant kind of way.  Generous, in a I'm gonna give you a second drink and not ring it on your check. I don't know if I'll ever go there again, but only because I probably won't ever be in Valdosta again...but if for some reason I ever had to go to Valdosta again, and needed a place to have a cocktail and chillax - well, I'd go visit Jeremy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-valdosta-5?start=20

Chips, stale. Wait, too long. Our server spent more time chatting with her friends than seeing how we were doing. We actually had to ask another table server to change out the stale chips.

Jamie S.,"Medford, OR",60,46,15,1.0,2/15/2017,"Guess I should've heeded the stars on this location, as my experience wasn't even decent. I sat at the bar because I went by myself as I'm here in Valdosta on business. Note: it was ten pm on a Wednesday night so not super crowded. I waited a few minutes and ordered a beer, no problem there. Got the menu at the same time. 25 minutes later... I finally got the attention of the bartender when she saw my card out to pay for my beer. Not one of the three people who walked into/ out of the bar area making drinks asked me what I wanted to order.  No one even acknowledged me except giving the beer and menu, and then paying. Needless to say there was no tip, a note on my tab, and I'm going to bed hungry tonight (everything else by my hotel is closed already). At least the guys across the bar from me had plenty of beers delivered.

Charlie R.,"Fountain Valley, CA",19,19,6,1.0,8/14/2016,"If I could give negative stars, I would. DO NOT GO HERE FOR SERVICE OR FOOD!! STAY AWAY!! Unfortunately they're the only bar open until 1am in Valdosta. This was my 2nd bad experience here but there was nowhere else to drink. Where should I start?  1) I ordered the 3 appetizer deal from the menu, 3 appetizers for $15. The problem here is that you get a smaller portion. I was fine with paying the regular price for the full portion. This wasn't cool.  2) I ordered garlic fries. These were delivered to me cold, Seriously, COLD. We sent these back to get a new batch made. When they came out, I asked for ketchup and water. Sitting at the bar, I could clearly see the bartender NEVER made an attempt to get either. I ended up going to another table and taking a bottle of ketchup. I was finally able to get a glass of water from another bartender.  3) A friend sat next to me at the bar and ordered buffalo wings. They came with no blue cheese, although it was ordered. He asked for blue cheese and it took at least 5 minutes and asking 2 different bartenders to bring it out. The wings are cold by now. With 3 wings left on the plate, the bartender comes and takes the plate, WITHOUT HIM BEING FINISHED!! He tried to tell her he wasn't finished, by this time she'd put dirty napkins on top of the wings. She then asked if he wanted the plate of wings back. Really? That was a slap in the face.  4) A guy came in just before last call and ordered the 2 for 1 beer. He got 1 beer and the bartender yelled last call. He paid his bill. He asked the bartender for the 2nd beer and she said, we had last call 15 minutes ago. He explained that he ordered on time and she never brought the 2nd beer THAT HE'D ALREADY PAID FOR. The bartender decided to go ahead and get him the beer but this was just unreal.  This night was like a scene from one of those fix my restaurant shows where everything went bad, with horrible service.  Unfortunately I may find myself here again because it's the only late night bar that's open. DAMN!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-valdosta-5

Wife ordered a Club sandwich -- and the cut in half and only filled on half. I ordered the 8 oz Sirlon - Medium. It was the typical frozen, packaged steak. Burnt on top, chewy, grisly, cold in the middle and wet on the bottom. To top things off, the tea was watered down and the mixed drinks were weak. Best thing about the meal -- the artichoke dip.

We had the ""taste"" of the pretzels and beer cheese (yum) , the app sampler , and the peppercorn crusted sirloin (lighter menu- not that great).
