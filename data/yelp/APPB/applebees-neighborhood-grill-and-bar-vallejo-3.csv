Kimberly B.,"San Jose, CA",4,69,10,4.0,9/25/2017,"I think I gave a review a while ago but I'm updating it now since my last visit with my boyfriend. Environment (5/5): Party-like with a welcoming and friendly feeling. Cleanliness (5/5): Didn't see the bathrooms this time but the rest of the place was clean Service (5/5): God seated in a good amount of time even with the crowd and waitress was super duper friendly Food (4/5): I got a roasted chicken w/ onions and shrimp on top, super good. My boyfriend's burger was a bit bland though.  Price worth (3/5): This time around the food was super duper good especially with the happy hour price for drinks and 2 for $20 deal but I've had times where the portion size and food taste were meh.  Overall (4.4/5): Good chain restaurant location overall",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-vallejo-3
Ricky B.,"Vallejo, CA",198,6,1,2.0,12/12/2017,"Recently, I came in to this Applebee's with a friend of mine and we were dissatisfied with our visit. Sunday evening, around 10 P.M, we ordered two macaroni and honey chicken entrees and a spinach artichoke dip appetizer from the 2 for $25 menu. I ordered a long island iced tea and handed my waitress my ID card when asked to. I'll admit, I do look young without makeup. However, my ID card says ""21 in 2017,"" my birthday says March 26, and it's the end of 2017. I don't think it was necessary for my waitress to hold the card extremely close to her face, squint at it, and begin counting out loud the math from my birth date until the current date. It was extremely embarrassing.  We didn't wait long for our food, but when it arrived, it was half the advertised size and it was unsatisfactory. The spinach artichoke dip appetizer and chips were heavily salted. Our macaroni and honey chicken was dry, tasteless, and slightly watery. We do not plan on eating here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-vallejo-3

Ended up calling the restaurant to inform them I was waiting in the suggested parking spot awaiting my order for 10mins and to go ahead and cancel the order.

Tried a ""healthy"" option of steak with ancient grains. A wet, weird. mess topped with fatty old smelling steak nubbins made me queasy. No food should be this watery...not even soup.

Besides that, they never brought the artichoke dip (listed on what is included). They finally brought and our bimbo server then charged me for it. When I told her it was listed on the menu as included, she said it was not, took it away, and reversed the charge for the dip. I should have disputed it with my credit card.

We were here on Labor Day and the wait time was less than 15 mins.; we came in at about 5:45pm for early dinner. Our young server, Terrence, was very attentive, friendly and accommodating. He was quick to serve our drinks to make the happy hour prices. Thank you. We ordered from the 2 for $20 menu, and we were satisfied.  The 3 cheese macaroni, chicken strips and lime chicken (I think) were all freshly cooked and tasted great. The portions were just right.

Sapphire B.,"Benicia, CA",0,21,7,1.0,1/5/2018,"The amount of people that complain about this store is undeniably reasonable. The decision Applebees has made to do nothing about it is incredibly unreasonable. Not only are their deals fake (dollar margaritas about 1/4 of the size of a normal 4$ margarita...), but their service is inconsistent and slow no matter who your server is. I had one incredible server and her name might have been Daphne or something but me and my friends all left her a nice not on the check. Anyways, every other server will basically forget what you ordered until you ask them about it. The food production has gotten slower and many times have had my food delivered cold because it was sitting on the counter and the server didn't think to pick it up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-vallejo-3
Nicole M.,"Vallejo, CA",63,12,,1.0,11/4/2017,"All day I was craving French onion soup, Applebee's has the best French onion soup.  I decided to take the whole family to Applebee's for dinner.  We got there at 5pm, not busy at all.  We were seated and sat there for over 10 minutes waiting for someone to acknowledge us.  Mind you 3 starving kids with no patience. I finally flagged someone down and asked if they could please send over a waiter.  A few minutes later a guy showed up and apologized for the wait.  Ok, we placed our order.  I asked if I could have French onion soup instead of salad, he said, sure no problem.  Another 10 minutes our waters finally arrived, and 2 salads.  I said, I ordered soup instead of salad, they took the salad away and the waiter came over and said, the salads are both yours, the soup will be out in a minute.  You told me I could have soup instead of the salad.  No, I never said that and walked away.  My husband got irritated and asked a hostess t9 see a manager.  The manager walked over we told her that our service was not so great, that we waited a long time to be acknowledged etc.  then told her about the soup.  Her response, there are no substitutions on the menu and the waiter knew that.  I responded, pretty angrily then the waiter should not have said no problem.  She then said, please do not raise your voice to me, I will not be talked to that way.  Are you kidding me! No apology, no how can I make it right, just total attitude.  I was a server and restaurant manager for over 20years. I also know some customers are really awful and difficult to deal with.  My husband and I were so appalled at how we were treated, we got up and left.  Went down the street to Black Bear diner and received excellent, friendly service and a good meal.  It's too bad, always liked Applebee's, was sad to hear a lot of them were closing down, but never again.  They have lost my business and the corporate office of Applebee's should be ashamed of the way their employees treat customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-vallejo-3
Renneth D.,"Berkeley, CA",5,117,45,3.0,4/3/2017,"Applebee's is a great way to have a economically-cheap and fun date night with your love, while also awkwardly having a high school reunion with those who never left after high school. The 2 for $20/$25 is my go-to, but it has its own problems. The ribs on there, for example, are a shame to ribs all over the globe. Their tough meat and lack of it make it more enjoyable for my dogs after I gnaw away the little bit of ""goodness"" that is on em.

Taste of food is just okay to me, I am not a fan but everything is just fine. My husband loved the food  The staffs are polite and always checking if we were okay or do we need anything else.

However our dinner Friday night was a total fail. We both had the plank fired salmon.  It was overcooked by a good margin, dry and tasteless. The veggies were also overcooked and mushy, having lost taste.  A waste of our money and the evening.   More irritating than bad food was the music. It was way too loud with plenty of screeching high notes and lack intelligible word. When the server was ask to turn it down, she tried and failed twice. The table  of 2 next to us got up and left before ordering. We were stuck.  Terrible!  I usually like to say something nice in a review.

Anna ..,"Vallejo, CA",12,1,,1.0,12/18/2017,"I can give you a detailed breakdown of my experience. If I can give 0 stars, I would. I came in at 1000pm, my order was taken and I paid for it at 1024pm. It's a good thing I asked for a receipt because 30 something minutes later at 1105, I went up to the host to ask about my order. She acted like I wasn't sitting right across her podium for the last half hour. I gave her my receipt, she went back to the kitchen, came out and gave me one of the most stupidest excuses. She told me that they ran out of chips and that they were preparing it in the kitchen. Basically my order was delayed for more than half an hour because of chips. Another ten minutes later at 1122, the server who took my order, came out, apologized and handed me my order and told me that since I paid for my meal, they cleared it in the kitchen. In other words, they completely forgot about my order. During that whole time I was sitting there, not one server or hostess ever came up to me to ask me what I was doing there sitting like an idiot, waiting for nothing. After this experience, I was already mad and just can't let it go. So I called the manager to complain, just outside the store because I didn't want to make a scene inside the restaurant which, knowing me, I probably would. She handled me nicely, I have to admit, because I was already beyond angry. I'd like to thank her for refunding my meal because of this bad experience. Unfortunately, when I got home, they messed up my order. I got brocolli instead of mashed potatoes, and I asked for medium rare and got well done instead. Truly not the experience I wanted especially after a long day at work.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-vallejo-3

Kristine M.,"Orland, CA",0,7,,1.0,11/18/2017,"I came in last night with my daughter on our way home from Stanford Medical.  Tired of dealing with traffic, we decided to stop for a decent meal at about our 1/2 way point.  When we arrived, we were told the wait would be about 15 minutes.  There seemed to be some confusion as to who came in first and folks were getting annoyed with parties of the same size being seated out of order. Once we were seated, I was surprised to notice at least 10 tables that were not being used.  This remained all through our dinner, even though folks were waiting in the lobby area.  Odd.   My daughter has food restrictions and asked for the nutritional menu with listed allergens.  As soon as this was out of my daughter's mouth, the server says, ""I don't know where that is, I'll get my manager.""  Then crickets.  We figure it out best we can and flag down our waitress to order.  We still have a drive and the wait to order is getting too drawn out. Our drink order was taken at the same time as the meal order. My daughter orders the Chicken with shrimp.  It's good, comes out as it should.  I ordered one of the new steak and potato dishes.  It's a 6 oz steak, choice of steak topper, fried onions, broccoli, and choice of special potato dish.  I order the horseradish topper and loaded potato tots.  What comes out is a naked steak, overcooked broccoli, and tots, without cheese topping.  No horseradish topper, no cheese on the potatoes, and no onion strings.  I inform the server of what's missing,  She isn't the same one that took the order, but she just stares at me like I'm speaking a foreign language.  Finally, she takes the plate back and I think they are going to fix it.  Should be a quick fix.  Nope.  Same plate comes back, onion has been added, still no topper, and now there is a crock of the potato casserole added.  I let the server know this still isn't right.  She then argues that the potato casserole  is the topper, so I taste it in front of her.  Only then does she believe me.  She leaves.  Now I'm sitting with a cold plate in front of me when the manager comes with the same potato casserole and says, ""I was told to bring this"".  I explain to her that I ordered the new special and what was missing. She leaves and returns about 5 or 6 minutes later with 3 small portions cups of refrigerator cold horseradish topping, stout gravy, and green onions.  At this point I give up.  My food is cold, it has gone back to the kitchen 3 times and still isn't even close to what was promised or pictured.   I eat cold over cooked broccoli, a few bits of tough steak (they did get the doneness right, but it was so tough, even my daughter commented on the way I had to cut it.)  and the potatoes.  This whole thing has taken twice the time it should and I need to get on the road The original waitress finally comes back by and asks if we want boxes.  I have to ask for the check.  After all the hassle with my meal, no one asked if it was ok, and there was no adjustment made to the tab.   We won't be back.  From what I see on the reviews here, this wasn't a fluke.  If you can't execute what is pictured, don't offer it.  My plate was handled by at least 3 different people front of house, including a manager and was still wrong.  I ordered what was offered, as it was offered.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-vallejo-3?start=20

She kept leaning towards us and slamming her phone and drink, when my boyfriend went to tell someone that she was disturbing us, the staff just looked at him and did nothing, and just kept watching her.

Frances V.,"Sacramento, CA",432,75,377,1.0,2/19/2016,"We came in on a Wednesday night and we were seated right away. We pretty much ordered everything on the happy hour menu which were: boneless buffalo wings, wonton tacos, spinach artichoke dip, chicken quesadilla, and mozzarella sticks. Only these appetizers are half off and you must purchase a drink in order to get the happy hour price. Don't get me wrong, our server was GREAT! she was very awesome and attentive to our needs, giving us enough time to decide on our choices. However, when are food was being delivered, the manager (I believe) who brought our spinach and artichoke dip (I guess he was holding too many plates) spilt the salsa ON MY PANTS and on the ground. Then while he was placing the dish on the table, spilled some chips on the table. I definitely did not over react. He apologized and my server handed me more napkins. Honestly, even if he apologized, it didn't seem like he cared very much. He didn't even come back to check up on me. This has never happened to me before.

The second time we went was during happy hour, we ordered the pitcher margarita and were basically given a pitcher of blue colored sprite. Tonight being the third and final time we'll ever go to this establishment. The waitress (I didn't get her name, mid-aged Caucasian lady) was extremely rude to my girlfriend and gave her dirty looks when she was ordering, then when she came back to our table she slammed my girlfriends water down and made it spill. She didn't apologize, all she did was have an attitude like it was our fault she was careless. We ended up just paying for soda and leaving, the service killed our appetite.

Also, a dish that we didn't order was delivered to our table so we sent it back. What was pretty terrible was three tables around us were also delivered wrong food to only be taken back.

The grilled chicken won ton tacos are an appetizer must! And the long island teas are stiff and only $3.69 (22oz)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-vallejo-3?start=80

Then about 20min later we asked for the remaining food and they told us they ran out of the 2 appetizers (green beans) we were waiting on and they had not made the other 2 plates we ordered  (rib basket and bourbon steak). After another 20min wait we finally got the steak and ribs. Then it took another 15min to get to go boxes and the checks.

Crystal B.,"San Jose, CA",0,7,,1.0,4/4/2015,"I don't normally leave bad reviews, but will preface this with the statement that the food was fine (when we finally got it) and the management seemed to be receptive to our complaints and apologetic.  About a month ago, my friends and I had spent the day at Discovery Kingdom and stopped off for dinner before the long drive home. The restaurant was busy so we were being patient, but as the time went on, we had not even had our drink order taken after an hour of being seated at the table. There were some electronic menus set out on the table that we kept trying to use, but they were broken. Kind of a tease...  We were really getting hungry and seeking for help. We found someone in an apron to talk to, but he ended up being from another restaurant on break to visit his friend! Even he was more helpful than the staff at Applebee's!!  When a waitress finally came over to take our drink orders (and dinner orders at the same time), she was incredibly rude and rolled her eyes at us when we commented on the long wait. I have worked in customer service for a long time and couldn't believe her attitude. When we finally got our food, it was fine and up to Applebee's standard quality, but the waitress never came back to our table to refill drinks or give us the bill. We had to find a manager to pay. Needless to say, we paid our bill, but left her no tip.

How I regret coming to the Applebee's in Vallejo.  To start things off, our waitress must have had a horrible day because she did not hide the fact that she was not happy.  We were greeted with such attitude we were blown away! We asked for a few extra slices of lemon... not too much to ask for right? .... wrong! Our waitress Leslie rolled her eyes almost as if she was completely annoyed..       Finally our dinner came..... The salsa was frozen!! Completely frozen!! We asked to speak to the manager  Alison and when she came her only response was, ""do you want a another serving of salsa?"" ""Do you want to me to remove the plate away from you"" .... wow!!!  Seeing as we hadn't eaten all day we were very hungry. We said we will eat it.      My mother and I had ordered the same meal ""Fiesta Lime Chicken"" my mother went to put sour cream on her chicken only to find a huge chunk of something and once again we had to call a manager Alison over. She picked it out of the sour cream and said  ""Oh it's a potatoe"" ...a potatoe?!? Mind you our meal had no potatoes at all.... So we asked how did something like that happen. As she shrugged her shoulders she said ""maybe a piece of potatoe  happened to fall in our jar of sour cream""     Ok ..... maybe. But then please explain how two huge chunks of potatoes ""happened"" to fall in both my plate of sour cream and my mother's sour cream. It was at that time that she (Alison the Manager)  looked at us and finally apologized.     Needless to say we will never ever come back here again. What a huge disappointment.  This place definitely needs a refresher course in customer service and maybe a reminder NOT to serve frozen salsa and also to keep the potatoes OUT of the sour cream.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-vallejo-3?start=80

Our waitress said she'll bring out some ranch and additional mushrooms. The ranch came about 5-8min later when we were half way finish with our burgers. The additional mushrooms came when my wife was almost finish with her burger.  Maybe service was bad because we were there for their burger and fries Monday special.

BellaLissa B.,"San Francisco, CA",8,99,20,3.0,4/24/2015,Hi y'alI'm here at Applebee's because they advertise that they have a great deal. I know appetizer and two entrées for 20 bucks. Plus Happy hour from 3 to 6 featuring margaritas which I'm in the mood for... BUT and that's a big butt Dottie.   The problem is that we got our appetizer and we started on it we were not finished with it and then our meal came so we had absolutely nothing in between the appetizer in the meal and that made me feel rushed. I do not like feeling rushed.  The drinks at happy hour or $3.59 if you order what's on the happy hour menu which happened to be margaritas which happens to be when I'm in the mood for BUT there is almost no alcohol in that drink. I ordered a shot which cost 10 bucks. Yes Dottie 10 bucks! So the bill was nearly $50 when we finished which is a piss her to say the least because I came here because they have happy hour and because they have a special which is two entrées and one appetizer for 20 bucks.

Ralph R.,"American Canyon, CA",396,16,1,3.0,9/21/2014,"I'm actually giving a higher rating now than I usually would. I will point out my reasons below but first let me say, I do not usually come here.  Service: the hostess was a total bitch.. She rolled her eyes when we came in and asked for a table for 3. Most of the waitresses here have attitudes but who could blame them? They get trashy uncivilized Vallejo people on a daily basis.  Restaurant layout: much cleaner than I've seen in the past but our lamp kept flickering... I was joking with my friends how I could probably get a seizure from the flashing lights. Manager/LOD: no where to be found.. There should be some interaction, presence or table touching. The Food: it was sloppy and my chicken was over cooked, I had a hard time trying to cut into it! It should be flakey and break easy. It's a hit or miss. I've been here in the past and had great meals! Since I grew up in Vallejo this was always the go to places with friends but honestly since Vallejo economically went down hill so did this establishment as well..  Timing: Our food took longer than is should of taken along with the traffic within the room, it was not that busy at all.  Our server: Her name was Angel M... I think. Because of her I gave a higher rating. This girl was working it! She immediately offered drinks as soon as we sat down. Other waitresses I've had took forever with any drinks at all. Angel was polite and she spoke with full knowledge of the menu. She consistently came by to check if everything was doing alright. She surprised me unlike her other coworkers. I decided to tip her more than 40%... I am from Vallejo and if you come here I advise you.. When you park your car in the parking lot make sure nothing is visible! It will get broken into. A lot of car break ins happen at Applebee's. Be aware of your surroundings, I see Kids who have kids that are unable to behave in public and ruin a good time or meal for everyone. For the restaurant? For a chain company... Applebee's is best as it gets! The 2 for $20 is my favorite pick and don't come here for happy hour. They are stingy with alcohol! Go to Chevys instead if you want to get turnt out!

Bernadette M.,"Hayward, CA",609,652,1036,3.0,10/21/2013,"I can't remember the last time I was at an Applebee's but I do remember that I enjoy their boneless buffalo wings. My ex actually used to work at this location many, many years ago so it was kind of strange being here. The place wasn't overly busy but it took the hostess a minute to try to figure out where to seat us. I guess she had to scan the restaurant to see if there was an open table instead of knowing from her podium as to what is or isn't available. So I thought I'd save her the headache and just offer to sit at the bar. So my friend and I grabbed two stools.  The bartender asked us what we wanted to drink before we saw a menu. I wish the counter wasn't so sticky. Underneath the bar could use a wipe down as well. I guess some people know what they want to drink but I'd like to see what they had to offer first. So I asked for menus and advised him that we were going to eat as well. Fruity and blended drinks weren't for me so I thought I'd make it easy on him too and order a 7&7, while my friend ordered a beer. Pretty straight forward, yeah? We went with an order of the boneless buffalo wings in their hottest sauce, onion rings and I had a wedge salad. All of it was pretty tasty. And the wings were exactly what I remember them to be. Glad to see that's consistent. Football was on the screen so that helped out the experience as well. Screaming children behind us, not so much.

For drinks my husband ordered a Long Island Iced Tea and I ordered a Bahama Mama but they were nearly all ice and tasted very watered down.  When we finished our drinks the glasses were still full to the top with ice.  We ordered a second round and I asked that the bartender not add so much ice.  The second round came with maybe 5 or 6 ice cubes each and they tasted so much better.   We haven't been to an Applebee's in years and the only reason we went this time was because we had a gift card and I was craving a good burger.  We noticed the decor has really changed, all the movie memorabilia is gone and they're going with more of a sports bar theme.  It might get loud in there on the weekends and during the dinner rush, but we came early so the place was pretty empty. All in all it was a very pleasant experience and I look forward to going again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-vallejo-3?start=120

Nothing over the top. But tell me why the family who was seated in the booth behind us....& AFTER us.... We're able to order a gang of chicken wings!? Bone in!? We were told it was sold out!

The mozzarella sticks had an old oil aftertaste. My pasta cream sauce was incredibly watery. And we were supposed to get late night happy hour pricing. But they didn't give it to us until we asked and then the beers were still almost $5 each. We had a gift certificate so I didn't make a big deal, but it was annoying.  And as we were half way through our meal two tables started fighting with each other. A man stood up and screamed at the lady across from his table, demanding to see the manager because someone needed to pay for his food - ""because of this belligerent drunk lady's behavior"" (she seemed quiet to me). The manager came out and tried to talk it out, and the two parties started yelling at each other more. The men stood up and stormed out and I assumed did not pay for the meal.

Ordered about $30+ worth of food and drinks and when we received our check, we put down a debit card and our $25 giftcard. When we received the receipt, they had put the whole $33.89 onto the card. I asked another employee to grab our waitress, Rachel F, and asked her about the giftcard. She left to go look for it. She came back and said she didn't find it, and left once more to look for the giftcard. Then, when she returned, she said, ""There wasn't a giftcard here"". I don't know what she went looking for those 2 other times, but now she was claiming there wasn't a thing. Asked to speak to the manager, Michael, who had said the waitress sworn she didn't have a giftcard. he asked what it looked like and we said it has an apple in the middle and $25 on the top right corner. He said those didn't exist (but I have seen them sold in Sam's club in triple packs). Then he said he would contact us about giving us a refund, but he would wait because with the holidays, a refund would take too long. We have not heard from the manager, nor have we received a refund. I don't know who took the card, but we were forced to pay the whole amount out of pocket, when the only reason we went there was because we had a giftcard to use.  This was a really frustrating issue, mostly because our $25 giftcard went missing and there was nothing the manager did to help us out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-vallejo-3?start=140

Their main dishes are a little more bland overall, but Applebee's is best for appetizers and drinks anyway.  I've probably been about 10 times, and the staff is a bit uneven.

Our salad came and the server clearly saw and mentioned no silverware was on our table and never came back with even a fork. Then our main server brought our coffee and set it down and never brought us spoons to stir so we sat there another 15 to 20 min. till our coffee was cold because no one ever came back to check on us. By this time we were ready to go. But was too hungry.  So I asked for the manager and guess where she was sitting on the other side of us at a table having her own party with a male companion. So once she got up she then proceeded to serve us, but then went back to her party. What ever happened to the manager going around to the customers to check on them and seeing how the food and service is. Start with her head and the rest will follow. The owner needs a meeting with the manager to get off her butt and take care of the customers and stop trying to have her own party and tell your servers to make sure the customer has what they need before they go on to the next customers. Have the host or hostess make sure there is silverware at the table when you are seated. Hopefully this helps. We'll be back to see.

A. V.,"Vallejo, CA",153,54,,3.0,4/6/2012,"Pro: For a chain restaurant, service has always been satisfactory to extraordinary.  Most recently, the service has met the latter end of the spectrum.  At most visits, I have noticed a very well trained and friendly staff. Special menus such as the ""Bourbon menu"" feature presents a descent mix of chicken or steak w. prawns.  My other customer perk about the restaurant chain in general is a good balance of ""lean"" and ""heavy"" items on the menu. My personal favorite ""heavy"" menu items is the ""Steak w. Parmesan and Shrimp."" As for my ""lean"" menu item, it has to be the ""Oriental Chicken Salad."" Dates and families, if you want cost-effective American comfort food, you can't go wrong with the ""2 for $20"" appetizer and 2 select entrees.  I have noticed the steady positive effect of this deal since its inception.  Con: Chain restaurants, nationally managed will present general guidelines for preparing and cooking food. So there's no reasonable expectation of an exquisite dish to satisfy food epicureans of the highest order.  Bottom Line:  While this is no great local American food landmark, it absolutely has a friendly atmosphere, is a descent place to get a a drink at the end of the week, a satisfactory meal or to show your date how much you care to save $ while putting into action these nine words, ""I cared enough to pay for a descent meal.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-vallejo-3?start=180

My dinner companions ordered cheeseburgers, which were the size of a happy meal hamburger. The fries were just thrown on the plate and there was no lettuce, tomato, or onion on the side. Needless to say, my companions and I all ate every single thing on our plate and did not leave the restaurant full. We are average sized people, so it's not as though we're used to buffet style portions. There was Black Bear Diner and Chevy's down the street, and it's so sad that we chose this place to throw are money away at. We informed the server that the portion size was small, and to his credit, he did deduct 10% from our bill and gave us a free dessert. However, I'm never coming back here.

Gill C.,"San Francisco, CA",358,379,1573,1.0,7/24/2009,"I usually don't have a problem with chain restaurants. I like Cheesecake Factory, Olive Garden, and even Red Lobster. I didn't have an issue with Applebee's until my latest experience. Now, I will never again go to an Applebee's. Did I mention never? If there's one thing you take away from this review, do not ever dine in or order to-go from this location! If only I could give this place a 0 star rating. I'm always honest with my reviews, and is rare that I give such a low rating. However, I feel with this experience, my patience had been tested to the max (and for anyone who really knows me, I'm an extremely patient person), and the service was absolutely horrendous.  I had a bad feeling about Applebee's, and my woman's intuition is usually right on the money. However, my friends (Candice and Ris) and I were starving and hoping to order to-go so we could take it to Ris's house. We rolled in around 8:30pm and placed our order within minutes. The gal in charge of the to-go orders was busy with other customers, so one of the hosts ended up taking our order (3 salads and an entree) and says the wait should be about 15 minutes. He didn't seem friendly and really took his sweet time seating the customers. Since there were no seats at the waiting area, we sat at the bar and proceeded to wait.  About 5 minutes later, the same host came over to confirm our order: Two Caesar Salads, a Steak/Portobello entree, and a Grilled Lime Chicken Salad (no onions) for me. Seems fairly easy to remember, no? I suspect he didn't place it or perhaps even lost the order. Hmmm, so much for taking 10-15 minutes, ROIGHT? SOUH Wrong! More waiting....another 10 and another 15.. At least we were able to talk and catch up with each other while waiting! Oh Mylanta!!! More waiting.....another 10 minutes passed. Candice inquired about our order, and the host replied that there was a back up in the kitchen. By this point, I was so hungry I was about ready to eat my arm, and thought that we should've just dined in instead as everyone who was sitting in the bar area had their food served to them and they arrived after we did!! ACK!!! It was close to 9:30pm and we decided to leave as the inefficiency and lack of customer service had become intolerable and absolutely ridonkulous (yes, you read correctly)! We were upset and regretted the decision to order food here. Of course, as soon as we made the decision, the food arrived. Charmaine (in charge of to-go orders) reviewed the food with us, and we asked for an explanation as to why it took almost an hour to prepare. An explanation/excuse was mumbled, and we asked if our bill could be reduced. She seemed confused, and obviously couldn't make that decision, so she got her manager. OMG, more waiting! What the hell!? Sigh.... The manager arrived, and explained the situation to him. He reviewed the bill and the time stamp on it wasn't exactly accurate as the host delayed in placing the order since he was waiting for Charmaine, etc.. So, I swear all 3 of us explained what happened. It was so aggravating and yes, asinine! He eventually agreed that the wait was far too long (umm yah!) and  said he'd take off the most expensive item off the bill. Oh geez, that's the LEAST he could've done. To make matters even worse, my salad had onions! By the time I ate, it was after 10pm and the chicken was lukewarm, spinach was skimpy, and the dressing was terrible! I could've made my own chicken salad for $5. It was the worst $10 ever spent for a salad. FTL!!

Once we had our table, we waited 10 minutes before anyone came over to even acknowledge us. I am a pretty patient guy, but 10 minutes without someone at least saying ""I'll be right with you"" is unacceptable. In fact, I had to go to the hostess stand and inform them that no one had come to our table. We saw the server 3 times. Once to take our order, then when our (awful) food was ready and then to deliver the check. Overall, you can find several other places to eat in that location.

Female friend had a weight watchers steak and portobello which was tiny, any guy would still be starving after that. Just because the portion size is cut in half it doesn't make it weight watchers. Atmosphere was a little on the offside. Asked the waitress what she recommended, but she said she was a vegetarian and so she doesn't eat  meat, which doesn't exist on the menu.

Jessica L.,"Vallejo, CA",0,3,,4.0,2/10/2010,"Review about an experience on Dec. 2009. I just now wrote a review b/c I went to another restaurant and made this restaurant just that much better. So. I usually come here for their new happy hour prices at night and have been glad b/c even a margarita would only be a few dollars. I'm glad that even in this economy, that they are still able to keep this restaurant in town.  I was just wondering though as to why they have a brand new staff and sort of miss the old ones. I come here often with my friends and have enjoyed the company of Remy (around Sept 2009) because her natural personality made us very comfortable and were not felt rushed at all. Oh and she was very professional about anything and if we did not like a certain dish, that she would immediately inform the manager, no questions asked. Another server, Charmaine, was always full of smiles which made the whole late-night dinner even better. She even knew what I was going to order before I even glanced at the menu! What a fantastic server. Of the servers that served me, I think she's the only one who did not stop by the computer  to talk to another server like others for even 10 mins! So that was a plus. And she even invited us back for another late-night dinner the next night. Although when I've asked to sit in her section, a host said that 'she just got cut'.

Miss C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,58,,1.0,9/4/2012,"If I could give zero stars, I would. Sadly, we chose to drop in here after a movie today, to grab a snack and a drink. We were seated quickly, but sat for 15 minutes with no service. Lots of wait staff looked right past us without caring.  I finally saw the manager (older red haired white lady) sitting and eating in the bar, and asked her if we had a server. She went and found one in the back, and the girl came out and took our order. The manager then brought us our drinks and went back to her lunch. The server brought us waters, and we noticed after a few minutes  one of the plastic cups was cracked and leaking all over our table. But our server had gone in the back, AGAIN. We waited about 10 minutes, and I was able to flag her down. I told her what happened, she took the cup and apologized, and went to get my husband another beer (then stood at the bar and texted for awhile on her Iphone), came back, set the beer down, and left, leaving us with the pool of water all over our table...and went back to god knows where. We waited and waited and waited, and finally I asked yet another server for our check, which she brought us. The we waited AGAIN for someone to pick it up. Our waitress came back out, picked it up, and disappeared AGAIN with the check and our cash. Needless to say, when she brought it back, she got the coins left from the bill as her tip. We ALWAYS tip well, and overtip, but not this time. We tried to find the manager again, but she had disappeared into the back after her lunch (her dirty dishes still sat at her table when we left) We will never come back to this place. Service has gone progressively downhill here, and its no wonder many local Applebees have closed their doors. It's time to close this one and start over too.
