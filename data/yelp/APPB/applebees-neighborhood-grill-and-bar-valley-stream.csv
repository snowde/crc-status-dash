Derrick J.,"Williamsburg - South Side, Brooklyn, NY",7,23,213,4.0,12/6/2017,"Well. After reading all the negative reviews, I still decided to have lunch here because it was the closest restaurant at the time.   Service: decent. I mean it's Applebee's.   Food:  decent .. it's Applebee's.  Didn't see rude servers, didn't see garbage or the floor, didn't see faces of patrons frowning from bad food.  Starting to think that expectations are way to high if you eating at a chain restaurant having a dollar Long Island ice tea and two for twenty bucks entrees!!  It's what to be expected.  It was pleasant",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-valley-stream
Robert D.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,2,2,1.0,12/20/2017,"I was not even greeted by the bartender. I only ordered an appetizer, which I cancelled after an hour wait!! No apology, nothing...so frustrating@",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-valley-stream
Candra S.,"SAINT ALBANS, NY",43,59,64,4.0,10/21/2017,Ive been to many different Applebee's over the years. It's good for an inexpensive meal. I'm a fan of their 2 for $20 deal. There's nothing special about this particular Applebee's except that it's connected to Green Acres Mall. I had their Whiskey Burger and it was scrumptious! This rating is mostly for that burger.  I hope it stays on the menu!! It was a fireball sauce that isn't overpowering and the onion rings on the Burger were the small kind making then easier to eat. Did I mention that it also had bacon? I recommend everyone try this burger. Lol,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-valley-stream
Farrah B.,"Brooklyn, NY",24,292,689,5.0,6/10/2017,"This Applebees is consistent when it comes to good, drinks and service.  The low rating surprised me quite a bit. We came here back during the restaurant anniversary and again a few weeks ago, and it was still really good.   I always sit at the bar, so I suppose my experience is different from those sitting at regular tables and booths.  Salads are fresh, boneless wings are fried crisp and juicy.  The star here would be the steaks.  They are cooked to perfection (medium, for me) and is full of flavor.  They even have happy hour after 10pm, everyday of the week with 1/2 price appetizers and drinks.  Take a chance, and sit at the bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-valley-stream
Kuwana L.,"Jamaica, NY",63,69,58,3.0,7/1/2017,"Honestly speaking, applebees is not and probably will never be a good restaurant to me. The food is always nasty. No matter the location. If you ask for steak or a burger medium, it always comes back well done and burnt. Ugggh ( the worst). Chicken quesadilla is always good I suppose from the appetizers except for yesterday. For some reason that quesadilla was disgusting. Flavorless with hardly any chicken in it. I did taste the overpowered flavor of the cheese though. . The three stars for this particular location goes to the staff. Very nice waitress. She kept asking was everything ok. She suggested some desserts for us. Everything came out prompt. Thanks for the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-valley-stream

Cierra C.,"East Flatbush, NY",383,1,1,2.0,10/12/2017,"I planned to come here with my best friend because I heard that there were $1.00 margaritas. I had a bartender named Patrick that served us. He didn't say hi, he just gave us menus and walked away. Then we asked him for two 1.00 margaritas and I specifically asked him to put salt on mine. He told me that it's was too much work for him to do because he makes a lot of margaritas within 5 hours. I checked my surroundings and noticed that there was only one guest at the bar and the restaurant wasn't busy at all. I kindly asked him and he said he'll do it for me. But as a guest who is excited to come to his restaurant, I shouldn't be told that it's too much work to do anything. Someone needs to be retrained on how to serve a guest and making their experience the best. Patrick obviously doesn't get the concept.

Samantha B.,"Queens, NY",95,15,10,1.0,5/7/2017,"So I recently visited this location on May 5th 2017 around 9pm . Me and my friends were having a girls night .. I came to this location hungry and left starving . Unfortunately that's not a great thing for a restaurant .  I ordered the new burger that the waiter recommended along with onion rings . The quality of the food was very poor . The onion rings tasted like card board and the burger was horrible , I couldn't force myself to eat the food. I explained to the waiter how frustrated and unsatisfied I was and he took my plate.  We also were never given napkins , forks, spoons at all and ketchup. We had to ask a waiter whom was passing by  The bill came and I assumed that because I didn't eat my food not even 10% of it , that he would of removed it from the bill but he didn't . I had to tell him and the manager never came out either to apologize about my food .  I came hungry and left starving , also left with the mindset of never returning . I would rather go to fridays that is next door then applebees again",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-valley-stream
Missy N.,"Jamaica, NY",0,31,6,1.0,6/18/2017,"My food tasted okay, simple appetizers we shared. They weren't great, and seemed like they had been sitting out. We came for happy hour.  We sat at the bar, my Long Island iced tea was a premixed bottle, not a fresh, shaken drink.  My husband had beers- he said they were a little less than cold. The bartender gave us a cup with ice?...  The bartender was not attentive at all and spent her time on her phone or with guys at the other end of the bar. We could not even get her attention.

Devon L.,"Far Rockaway, NY",16,9,16,1.0,5/4/2017,This was horrible experience so dirty did not clean the area. They say us here at this table. The worse experience and I love some Applebee's. I will never go back to this one or recommend it. I know people who worked there and told me do not ever go to this one and I was in a rush and wanted some wings and look at this smh.  As a business for you to sit people down in an area and think this is okay and normal we could've waited 10 more minutes for the area to have been swept.  Then the drinks was horrible manager was upset but still took them off the bill. I will never again go there or recommend this Applebee's to anyone they are not clean.

Marissa M.,"JAMAICA, NY",519,437,1152,3.0,7/14/2016,"Gotta give credit where it's due even though I'm no Applebee's fan. This location has improved despite previous reviews. My daughter likes to go because of the kiddie menu and Presto game kiosk so I had no choice for a late Wednesday night dinner.  The servers have stepped up their game and so has the kitchen staff. With new menu items and deals to stay,  A B'S may be making a come back sooner than we know. My daughter ordered mozzarella sticks that were crisp and hot, chicken tenders kids meal. I ordered the cedar grilled salmon that was charred perfectly. I love my salmon soft inside and char grilled outside. This was perfection. I paired my meal with green beans and mashed pecan candied sweet potatoes. I was really impressed by this location. In the past they were not up to par but this time I was blown away.

Rich R.,"Woodmere, NY",0,7,,1.0,5/1/2017,"My very first experience at this Applebee's was a very negative one. The wait for a table was not long but the service after that point was very unpleasant. Our drinks and silverware came a little after the food, which by the way had a wrong order for one of us in the group. Necessities like straws and napkins also came much later than expected. When the silverware did arrive, it was in a glass of cloudy water that did not seem very clean. The food itself was not at its optimal warmth and thus took away from the flavor. The Long Island Iced Tea that a friend of mine ordered tasted unlike any other LI Iced Tea for some reason. The taste was reminiscent of dishwater and ginger...an unlikely combination lol. Once these issues were brought to the manager, he properly apologized and gave us a free dessert. We vowed to never return.  Come here if you so desire. You might have a better experience than I did.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-valley-stream
Andy M.,"Brooklyn, NY",559,26,1,1.0,10/21/2016,"OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOK, let's get into this.  First off, I can't say anything bad about the food. It was usual Applebee's food. There was nothing wrong with it.  What I had a BIG problem with was the employees.  There were two of us. We sat at the bar and just had beer, wine, and some apps. Nothing too big or hard.  The two bartenders were named Kahl (male) and Franny (female).  Kahl ignored us when we sat down right in front of him. Franny eventually came over and took our drink orders. She was pleasant enough and seemed nice.  We got our drinks, ordered our food, and talked a bit.  This is where the issues started. There were two women ( I didn't get their names) sitting on opposite sides of the bar, talking to each other. Not sitting NEXT to each other, you understand, sitting literally on opposite sides, so that their conversation could be heard by the entire bar and the tables that were close. They even joked about how loud they were talking.  Soon, I realized why they were sitting like this. They work there. I only figured this out when Franny, Kahl, and the two other women all began complaining and talking shit about other employees that work there.  Now, I understand that employees complain about other employees and about their bosses. This is nothing new and it's as it should be.  What I CAN'T accept, is when the two employees sitting at the bar start saying at the top of their lungs... ""They all faggots! I don't like NO ONE here. They all faggots!"" All of this is happening loud and clear, with TWO young children sitting very close to them.  That...is NOT ok.  Soon, Kahl is trying to clock out of his shift, so he's ignoring us and complaining to the other employees about hurrying up so he can ""get the fuck out!"". We had to interrupt their homophobic conversation just to ask for our check.  This is a corporate, family restaurant. Not cool.  And ""faggots""? Seriously? What year is this?!?!?  Thumbs down. We will NEVER eat there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-valley-stream
Amanda S.,"Brooklyn, NY",75,4,,1.0,11/7/2016,"I came here with a table of 9. We made reservations, but still had to wait.  The service was horrible, we had two kids and they sat us in the bar section. REALLY ?  After asking for the booth, they insisted that this section would be comfortable and we would have to wait long for a booth. Being that we were starving, we just sat there.  The food was mediocre, nothing more than commercialized ready made meals.  I am now reminded why I haven't been to Applebees in so long. Even the two for $20 deals had menu choices that were NOT exciting.  Also, the service level here is below average. A bunch of just out of highschool kids, with attitudes. It's great that they are working, but the manager should know who to put in charge or not.  While leaving we walked through the lobby and smelled the horrible skunk like marijuana smell, which just turned my stomach. Seriously, are they smoking on the job. Just horrible.  Will never be returning!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-valley-stream
Roseann C.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,9,,1.0,2/24/2017,The worst Applebee's I have ever been to. The employees are extremely rude and obviously weren't taught the basic principles of customer service.

Mariah B.,"Rosedale, Queens, NY",589,238,3338,3.0,10/19/2015,"Don't we all love at least one thing from Applebee's? The sweet potato fries are off the chain ! I came in here with my friend to grab a quick bite to eat after walking all over Green Acres mall. We were not instantly greeted , but they finally noticed us standing in the waiting area, we were. There was no wait. We were seated within minutes. Our waitress was very nice. she was attentive, and gave great suggestions because I was picky. I had a Sangria, it was way too sweet, and tasted more like juice than wine. The sweet potato fries I had got as an appetizer came with four different sauces. and OH MAN they are good. I had to order some more. I made my friend order a burger because when you do, you get unlimited sweet potato fries. Amazing. For my meal I got the salmon which was exceptional. The plating could have been better. but eh, whatever, I had fries. I would come back, not to sit and eat, but to take out some sweet potato fries.

Then, as I walked in the hostess Antoniota said here he come back as I approach which I thought was rude. When I advise the steak was over cooked it was as if I was bothering them. So now the rest of the food is now getting cold. Just not a good customer experience and food experience.

Dani W.,"Malverne, NY",0,38,,2.0,12/20/2016,"After reading the poor reviews about Applebee's they need to get their act together. I have eaten here occasionally because the mall food court is always crowded. The last time the food had to go back because it was not hot.   I had lunch recently and the food was okay. But that is not the point this time. First, let me say Applebee's is not cheap. Lunch or a dinner will run you ten dollars plus.  What was shocking were the napkins! Yes, people the napkins. The napkins were the same texture and color as the brown paper towels that you find in public restrooms. What is going on here. The napkins were hard as a rock.   Applebee's is sliding down hill fast at this location.

Drinks were very watered down as well. I asked for a drink without ice. I received 1/4 of what would've been on ice - meaning the rest of the drink would've been water.

Leslie R.,"Inglewood, CA",91,20,,1.0,4/3/2017,My first time to apple bee's on vacation with my husband . We kept seeing apple bees every where so while in the mall we decided to give the a try. First thing our waiter Ryan was playing with his hair while taking our orders and having a little meeting with other employees two booths behind us talking about his hair? Really? My drink was water down and I asked was it a virgin drink the manger came to respond saying everything is measured. Can I offer another drink I took him up on the offer glad I did much better 2nd time around. I suppose my expectations we set too high the appetizer (spinach artichoke dip) yuck my husband's chicken was dry a s the desert he some how stomached his meal. Ryan recommendations for me was some taco  a newer item on the menu I should have order the dry chicken. One bite and I was done the manager comes  again asked me how was the food I told him I didn't care for the tacos and he asked would you like me to leave them? I said no he asked can I offer you something else. I'm over it NO thank you!! I will grab a slice a pizza on any NY street and be more satisfied. Ryan come back twirling his hair with the check I noted the price for the drink was wrong and brought it to his attention. He steps away for 4 minutes then makes his way back towards us to help someone seated behind us. Me and husband become very irritated and speak of our irration. He completes the order the pops his head in and says I'm waiting on my manager to make the adjustment. Then returns another 3-4 minutes with the correction. My husband gives him the money for the bill Ryan asks do you need change. We say yes he goes back to table two booths back with his co workers and says they want change back. WTF does he not realize we can hear you stupid little boy and owe you nothing. I WILL NEVER step into another apple bees EVER.

Stacey J.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,2,,1.0,3/14/2015,"Disgusting food and a waste of time. I usually love Applebees. This place is understaffed and managed horribly. My boyfriend, daughter and I came in last week Sunday 3/8/15 for dinner around 7:30pm, we were told it would be a 15/20 min wait. This was fine since every other place was an 1-1 1/2 wait but thinking about it now I should've left. After about 25 mins we were seated, while waiting we figured out everything we wanted from drinks to food so we can be in and out. The waiter came and we ordered everything we wanted. He bought out the appetizer and kids meal pretty quickly (8pm) which was fine since our daughter was really hungry. He then bought out the drinks and then it went down hill from there. We waited almost another 30/40 about 8:40/45 before our food arrived but that was only after our server finally passed by again and said ""wow they didn't bring out your food"" then ran to the back. I'm assuming they forgot about us and just tried to whip out the food as fast as they could. I ordered the 3 penne cheese i believe and it looked like they just threw everything on it, the cheese was cold and the penne wasn't cooked. My boyfriend got the steak the vegetables were horrible and wasnt offered steak sauce.

I kindly sent it back because it was under cooked. I received my second dish and the shrimp looked exactly the same . I was starving and didn't want to wait so I ate what I could.  3rd I asked to speak with the chef. I already paid so it wasn't to get free food just to let him know that the food wasnt full cooked. The chef told me "" it won't do anything to you to eat raw shrimp "" at that time all I could do was laugh and leave . I realized that this store doesn't care about service at all.

Things that made me want to pull my hair out: 1. Waiting an an hour and a half to get into the eye of the shit storm. For some reason the people who frequents Green Acres and this Applebee's love to consume steamy piles of excrement in form of crap service, crap interior, and OK food that doesn't make up for the manure. The last few times I was dragged  there I was welcomed by an army of people eagerly awaiting to be showered in cow pies.  2. Horrible service.  The people who work there seems to be more unhappy to be there than I was. They don't give a shit, they don't care about providing good service, and the majority of them are just plain rude unpleasant people. 3. Sticky seats, sticky tables, splotchy utensils. Just ick.  4. The kitschy stuff hanging on the walls was cool in the 90s. It would be tolerable if they change up once in a blue moon. Now it's just irritating. Things that didn't make me want to pull my hair out: 1. The food is OK.  Decent food with a lot of selection. It's your standard chain restaurant food available  inexpensively through various deals.

Me and my friend went to eat there today and our server was ok but the reason why I want to give negative stars is because they served me RAW CHICKEN!!!!!!!!!! I couldn't believe it. I ate one and noticed that it didn't taste like usual then I ate another one and I immediately spit it out because it was so slimy in my mouth! I asked for the manager and her name was Lindsey, I told her I was served raw chicken and that I ate a piece already and all she could tell me was sorry and that I can't get sick off of one piece of chicken and if I wanted another batch! So after she took my tray away my entrée and chicken came out at the same time... This time cooked thank God! When it was time to pay I see that I was still charged for the chicken...this was so crazy to me she should of made sure that that was at least taken care of! I had to request that be taken off the bill and she took off 5 DOLLARS!!! I then complained to another manager and he did nothing about the situation...I am very disappointed with the service I got today.

Scrumptious.  2 for 1 drinks. Can't beat that. Not strong. So you'll need both if you're trying to feel it.

Sonny G.,"Malba, Queens, NY",2244,415,1191,2.0,11/8/2011,"I decided I am going to start reviewing chain restaurants even though I usually dont unless the service is impeccable/terrible.  I feel as If these places need some loving too. After all they are restaurants, and they NEED to be reviewed.  Mainly I'm going to be comparing different chain restaurants based on pros and cons of food/service/atmosphere.   This particular Applebees just didn't cut it for me.  To start we ordered and appetizer and drinks.  Now happy hour drinks (or whatever deal they had going) were two for one.  You have to get both drinks at the same time, which is fine but  what got me is angry is this... as a person who has worked in a restaurant before, the drinks are the first thing you bring to the table.  I'm sorry but if the appetizer comes before the drink that's a problem because there are people like me who need a sip of somethig after each bite, that easily go through 3/4 drinks per seating (whatever kind of drink that may be).  Now in this case he brought our appetizer first and I just assumed that he obviously was waiting for the bartender to make my two Pina Coladas.   So we start eating our appetizers and of course I'm getting thirsty (he hadn't brought my Bf's soda either).  He's like no where to be found and I'm kind of trying to wait for my drink to come before i continue eating.  The appetizer (trio) was not hot.  It was between warm and room tempature.  We finally got another waitress who got our waiter, and he came with my Bf's soda.  I told him about our appetizer and he said he would have it warmed, but I figured by the time he came back our entrees  would be on there way.  I told him to let the chefs know so other people don't have the same problem.  I then asked about my drinks and he said the bartenders were making them so I asked for him to bring me a water...:...........:............:.......:......... ...........:........................... .                  ..........:........................ As were finishing our appetizer AND my bf's soda our food comes (from a different waiter).  I STILL DON'T HAVE A FUCKIN DRINK!!! NO WATER, SODA, OR PINA COLADAS!! Now we have NO MORE drinks left, we don't know where our waiter is, and at this point I'm pretty full from the appetizer/soda.  By this point at the restaurant me and my bf would be out in another 15 minutes because we usually bring 75% of our food home.  Once again I am trying to hold off on eating my entrée because I'm very thirsty....so as I'm stalling I see our waiter and call his attention again and gives me a look of oh yea your drinks"".  I start to eat with the intention of my drink finally being on its way.  Once again waiting-- after about 10 minutes I was really pissed and got up to talk to a manager because I wanted them to take the drinks off my bill, sure enough who comes over to the table...(it seemed as if every time I was at a boiling point he would pop up).  Now I have two huge Pina Coladas and a plate with 80% of the meal left on it. The moral of the story and point of my review is to say that this Applebee's has a bunch of scatterbrains working.  Applebee's are within a 5mile radius or so of one another.  Go to the new one Elmont.  Go anywhere, but here.  Save yourself frustration.

Steven V.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,91,6,1.0,7/3/2011,"So it was mid-afternoon, hadn't eaten yet, wanted to beat the traffic, driving past it on the way home, thought about the commercials and the deals.  That's how we came to go to Applebee's at the mall. Ugh!  Waste of money and time!  And they don't want to change because they are executing the corporate procedures so this place stinks from the top! They overcook and dry out everything, unless you order something where you control the temperature (my steak was rare).  Otherwise, the cheeseburger sliders were dry, tough, and better for hockey as a puck.  The tequila lime chicken was burned, tough, and dry untill we actually squeezed lime over it.  The worst, believe it or not, was the rice.  Yes, they make their rice dry, hard, and like rubber!  And the cooks are doing as directed!  I'm glad I have a dental plan! The topper to this story has to be the server.  Polite and corporate.  However, when she said that instead of the potatoes that come with my steak, I could have onion rings so I, of course, said 'yes.'  I got charged money for the onion rings!  She was also very attentive on my raspberry lemonade offering me refills.  She, again, charged me, for something and not tell me in advance or even during!  And we had four refills!  I really thought that practice is called 'petty larceny' but I could be wrong.

Ken -.,"Valley Stream, NY",0,11,,1.0,7/18/2013,"Never in my life have I experienced such a derogatory service and establishment. If I had known better, I would've skipped the wait time and saved my money to eat the higher quality food that my pet dog consumes on a daily basis. It is not an enjoyable experience sitting on dirty, sticky, and unsanitary seats while attempting to deal with the repugnant staff and unpleasant food. The amount of unprofessionalism radiating from this establishment is so appalling that I would rather have kindergarteners serve the food while paying them tenfold. If you do decide to go here, I hope you enjoy the zoo. I discovered a new level of abomination that I have never tasted from any type of food in my lifetime. The overcooked food and small portions along with the strong taste of your very own household refrigerator puts the restaurant industry to shame. The waiters would much rather be watching the basketball game simultaneously occurring on 10 different televisions than give the slightest bit of attention to the needs of a customer. If you do decide to go here, stop what you're doing, stand up, and sprint for the door as fast as you can. Don't look back, don't say a word. They must think straws serve no purpose to individuals who require fulfilling their thirst and diluting the strong taste of such horrendous food in their mouths. I also had no idea that a dine-in restaurant does not offer metal spoons. Instead, I was given black, plastic spoons that were still in the slimy plastic wrapper, which I had to manually remove myself.

Shaan N.,"Valley Stream, NY",0,2,,1.0,12/15/2013,"This is my first review. I am a fan of yelp, I read it a lot when I want advice on a nice place to go with my wife. Let me first start by saying that I am a man's man. I love sports and beer with wings etc...... while I'm watching a sports game. I also love to support local businesses in my area. I am also 33 years of age. After working a long week of work I decided to go to my local Applebee's at Green Acres Mall. My wife was home with our 1 year old. I wanted a quick beer, wings and some me time. I just moved to Valley Stream so I wanted something quick so I went here. It was a long wait, which I understand. I was happy that the host was able to get me a seat along the bar area, without a wait. The bar was crowded which is not a problem at all. I like a nice football crowd. I waited exactly 20 mins before my waitress came to greet me. While I was waiting I looked at the staff whom were all no older than at least 21. I have no problem with that. I love to see young people working. They were extremely loud and talking amongst themselves. One female who is West Indian was yelling across the bar and rudely yelling at the bartender. I am an African American; I have respect all races but I was still waiting for my waitress and observing this rude behavior. I finally placed a order for a blue moon beer which they did not have. O.k. no problem 2 for 1 I'll take a Long island ice tea. My drink came 15 mins later. It took me 25 mins to finish both drinks. My waitress never came back to take my food order. But I knew where to find her. She was standing next to the other 21 year old staff members with the bartender and the loud West Indian  waitress. I got her attention and called her over. I ordered burger sliders which were good and came quickly. I was done with the sliders in 15 mins. I was ready to order my entrée. Where is my waitress? Don't worry I knew where to find her. I got her attention and ordered 10 buffalo wings with the bones. My food came about 25 mins later boneless. Her assistant brought it to me. I told her assistant I ordered on the bone. Her assistant left with the wings and came back 5 mins later with the wings again boneless, SMH. Again I told her I want it on the bone. She left and my waitress came 10 mins later and asked me did I want it on the bones or not. OMG, How hard is it for a man to get a order of wings. The wings finally came about 10 mins later. I ate my wings and order nachos to go for my wife. While I was waiting for my nachos, an older caucasion family arrived next to me a waited 15 mins before someone took there order. I called the manager over and complained. Like I said I'm a man's man, but I expect good service. The manager looked like she was a heroin addict. She was nodding while I was talking to her. I could not wait to leave. I paid my bill and still left a %20 tip. I went home to give my pregnant wife her nachos which was extremely dry with no chili. I Then took a bite out of my wings, which had blood in it. Like I said this is my first and maybe last review. Don't go to this place. And for my men who think this is a nice outing to watch football think again. Don't go here. The food is awful, the staff is young and untrained and the manager is a heroin addict.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-valley-stream?start=40
