Victor K.,"Vancouver, WA",0,1,,3.0,2/8/2015,Service was slow. Had to wait for 5 min for the hostess to come. Maybe short staffed? Table very sticky.  They said it's because the finish is coming off. Wiped the table with a wet napkin and it was brown. They need to change tables or put glass ontop.

Mahsa K.,"Portland, OR",186,286,300,3.0,1/5/2014,"I came in, I knew what I wanted and I got it. No out of the way effort to rate on anything else, but complete satisfaction on following through with my expectations. I wanted 1-salmon, 2-asparagus, and 3-rice....... of the whole chain's average menu, like a beacon to my dietary delight, came exactly what I was looking for and on the under 550 calorie menu at that. One thing, it was supposed to come with potatoes, and I didn't see rice anywhere on the menu, but they must have had it because our waiter said I could sub rice for the potatoes and no extra charge. Exactly what I wanted, medium-rare perfectly pink center, sauce on the side for even less calories and only $14.99. Kudos for that and friendly service.

John L.,"Vancouver, WA",9,36,10,1.0,2/20/2010,"Applebee's serve some regular fair that is on par with any chain store.  Normally, service is what set things apart.  And here we have one where service sets things far on the wrong side. We frequented this Applebee's because my wife is enthralled with their Asian Salad.  But the service, as few others has pointed out, is hugely a hit and miss.   Here is my one and last visit. My wife, son, and I went there for an early dinner at around 4:30PM.  We were seated promptly in a booth at the end of the right side of the restaurant.  So far, so usual. Here is where it went all wrong.  From the local to the management level. We waited over 10 minutes.  3 wait persons came up and down the aisle and none acknowledged us.  No water, no ""I'll be with you in a second"", nothing.   We watched as people who came in much later than us get seated and served with drinks.   I went up to the bartender and asked for a manager.  Someone with an Applebee's shirt self identified and asked me what's going on.  I informed him that we have sat there over 10 minutes without service, and are wonder what's going on.  He tersely said ""well have a seat and we'll be with you."" I did.  And watched him go to another table in the bar area to chat up for over 5 minutes. We left.  We went across the parking lot to the McGrath's Fish House. You know what?  McGrath's Fish House gave us great service.  I also realized for the same food, McGrath's is less expensive, and, according to my wife, taste better. I did send an email to Applebee's and to their credit, a regional manager did call me.  He mentioned he will address the issue and have the store manager, Jennifer, sent an invite back to prove their service.   The only thing is, after a month, nothing but lip service.   So if you happen to be near, and want to know where to go, really - Sweet Tomato and McGrath are great options.  Across the street is a fine Pho place called Green Papaya.  All which I frequent.  They will take care of you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-vancouver-11?start=40

Warren C.,"Portland, OR",115,221,5,1.0,8/1/2011,Its probably been a couple years since I've been inside this Applebee's out here in Vancouver. Back in the days I literally knew the whole staff from the servers all the way to the kitchen staff and management. You would always think that places that have left you quite a bit of memories will always bring you comfort when you step in the door. The case is apparently different with this location of Applebee's.  I walked in here this evening after a meeting with a couple of my associates out here in Vancouver. Seeing that it was almost 10pm there wasn't a whole lot of options around the Mill Plain area so I decided to stop by Applebee's and get some HH food. I walked right in and sat at the bar because I was looking to just get something to eat and go on my way. It took quite a bit of time but finally the bartender was able to assist me after his lengthy conversation about nothing with another customer. I ordered my drink and made my order and spent my time waiting at the bar playing video poker and facebooking on my Blackberry. After quite some time I realized it seems a little longer then normal that my food has not come out yet. I decided to just visually look around and the bartender notices my restlessness and assures me my order was coming in soon. I go through my friends check ins on foursquare and realize it had been 22 minutes since I made my original order. All I ordered was Nachos and and an order of buffalo wings. Its pretty obvious how easy these two orders are but apparently I was wrong. I waited a few minutes more and notice these two guys that had came in 10 minutes after I did had just received their order so I was little irritated by it but willing to let it go. A few more minutes go by and my order finally goes through.  Total time it took to get an order of Nachos and Wings? 32 minutes altogether. I could easily understand the length of time if it was absolutely busy that night but at most there was maybe 10 tables all together that night and it was a Sunday night. I don't have to write this down but its a fairly easy order to fulfill. Other then the wings being fried the rest of this ordered would have been microwaved. I was not a happy camper and no apology was given as a result of the lateness of this order. No reason to sit here and gripe about it so I ate my food and went on my way. Even though I got bad service I will still tip the minimum 15% gratuity. I've worked in the service industry a number of years and feel they still deserve it just out of habit. Thanks for nothing guys... This is the last time you will ever see me here ever again.  This is not eating good in the neighborhood.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-vancouver-11?start=40
Georgette B.,"Vancouver, WA",0,3,,2.0,1/2/2012,"Had not been to Applebee in a while. Usually we would order the Bourbon Street steak with a glass of wine. So Sunday, New Year's day my husband and I decided to pay them another visit. A we entered there were two parties waiting to be seated. So three parties are waiting and there are three tables on the left unoccupied. Well after 20 minutes we were seated at one of those vacant tables. Did not make one bit of sense. Why the wait?  After we were seated we ordered 2 of the steak and shrimp which looked fabulous on the menu. With what appeared to be 2"" shrimps atop the steak, steamed vegies, parsleyed red potatoes. Yum. We ordered 2 Heineken which came promptly, were plunked on the tables without glasses. So we figured, yes we could drink from the bottle, although in my  culture that is not considered cool for a lady to do. Because we were quite hungry, by then it was 2:00pm we ordered a bowl of soup and that came quickly. And was decent. The entree, however, took a while to arrive, and when got it it was cold. I assume it had been sitting a while in some corner of the kitchen as the staff was quite busy tending to the table of 20 next to us. Oh yes they got great service. At our expense it seems. Anyway big disappointment. The order was a miniature version of the picture on the menu. The shrimps were about 1/2"" long, the potatoes had been sitting in water a while, they were cold, and worse the vegies that were supposed to be steamed were raw. And there was a huge clump of broccoli sitting there. Never mind that the steak was so tough that I could not finish it. Worse cut of meat I have ever had. Bye bye applebee. Wish we had gone to McGrath as we had first discussed. Will be wiser next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-vancouver-11?start=40

Okay, well actually the service was very attentive but there weren't that many people.  All the same, our table got something like four water refills in less than an hour.  Bravo waiter. I usually stay away from Applebee's all the same, exactly for the fact that the food is so regular and unimpressive/American (although tasty for what they offer).  But they do have some decent specials.  Talking happy hour here (3-6pm).  No, the drinks aren't real cheap here, but the appetizers are half of.  Which means a big basket of Boneless Buffalo wings or a plate full of chicken quesadilla.  Not a bad lunch during the summer.  (People always tend to want lighter meals when it's hot.) So not bad at all Applebee's.  You really hit the spot.  I will definitely consider returning when looking for a place to eat out.  Oh, and I love your Teriyaki burger.  I just don't love the $12 price tag.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-vancouver-11?start=40

Their cocktails were either taste like water down, flat coke or super sugary. I ordered a streak salad for take-out, I asked for medium rare and what I got was some kind of over cooked steak.

Wanted cup of soup - only had ""bowls.""  The waiter assured me the bowl was 5 oz., which actually cracked me up - I did research at home and a ""cup"" is generally 6-8 oz. and a bowl around 12 oz. Their BOWL is smaller than a normal CUP.  And it truly was small. Ordered corn chips to supplement - they never came. The place was quiet - but workers were scarce. When we saw them they were typically clustered together chatting. Worst thing was that the heat was blasting on us entire time - it was uncomfortably hot. Felt sorry for workers. After we asked, Manager told us they had adjusted it but that the furnace ""had mind of its own"" - and it just kept pumping out heat.

Sharon M.,"Vancouver, WA",2,24,,2.0,2/25/2015,"Had a gift card for Applebee's and last night we went for dinner about 6:40 pm.  Promptly greeted, seated, and asked if we had plans  Expecting a food or drink related question I stared blankly at the server.  Then with my endless wit replied, ""What?""  The full question was repeated a little hesitantly, Did we have plans?  Felt a bit like being in a Bullwinkle and Rocky episode that I didn't remember being cast in.  Yes, we did have plans - to eat.   Then on to drink selection, mine, water, MDS wanted flavored lemonade and asked what flavors there were.  The server said ""Lots""  The same server who was so interested in our ""plans"" wasn't so interested in providing information about the flavors or maybe a password was required.  After a few guesses of flavors that were not available he reluctantly provided us with a list.  We looked over the very wordy and complicated menu, hard to do when hungry and without the decoder key.  Decided on the $25 twofer with onion rings as an appetizer, and entrees of fried shrimp and grilled chicken breast.  Onion rings arrived, very brown, hot and with a cup of dipping sauce.  The onion rings tasted slightly scorched and the dipping sauce was a too sweet barbeque. Neither enhanced the flavor of the onion which is what I wanted to taste.  Burgerville does it better.  Between ordering and receiving our entrees at least three to four random servers asked us questions, only one of which had any purpose except in fulfilling their  version of providing good service.  Service which was totally unrelated to any action on our part.  It was annoying and guilt provoking - I mean, who wants to admit to being annoyed by people supposedly trying to please us?  Use your eyes and ears people!  If customers are engaged in talking to one another or eating, have full water glasses, aren't looking around to catch someone's eye - leave them alone.   Now for the food.  MDS was happy with his shrimp even though they were the same dark brown as the onion rings.  The breast of chicken I ordered was superbly tender and moist as well as plentiful.  The sautéed mushroom & onion were flavorful but were cooked in 1/4 cup oil when  a tablespoon could have done the job.  The red potatoes were a dark brown and very dry.  MDS gave me his cole slaw which was nicely dressed, seasoned, and fresh tasting.  The fresh parsley was a very nice addition. So, a 2 for service, only because no one was rude and we did get our food.  The food ranged from a 1, the onion rings and potatoes, to a 5 for the chicken and shrimp for an averages of 3.  Making the final score a 2.5 which Yelp doesn't support.   .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-vancouver-11?start=20

Thomas C.,"Vancouver, WA",5,1,,1.0,8/26/2013,"I used to love Applebee's however, it's just not the same anymore. This Applebee's, especially, was unremarkable in every way. The staff isn't all that bad, however the food was VERY mediocre and absolutely NOT worth the price. The grilled chicken was bland, there was absolutely no flavor in the meat of the chicken; it's just hidden with a rather tasteless glaze on top. My girlfriends onions weren't even caramelized (Which isn't a huge deal but when you're paying $15 and practically the entire topping was raw it's not very appealing to say the least). The sandwiches are a joke; there is NO way any of the sandwiches they make are worth even 1/2 of the price. Their fries are mediocre, the fish and chips aren't worth the price and rather bland. About the ONLY good thing they have are their deserts. They're tasty and aren't super spendy! Overall, If you want pretty small portions of overpriced mediocre food then definitely hit up this Applebee's! But I will be avoiding this place from now on sadly.

Anita F.,"Vancouver, WA",0,1,,1.0,11/2/2017,"I hadn't been to Applebees for awhile  and we thought we would come back.  The service was prompt, the appetizer was tasty and the restaurant wasn't very busy.  Unfortunately, the entree that I have enjoyed in the past was a huge disappointment.  The meat was cooked to the consistency of jerky and I didn't eat half of it.  I  won't be back for a long time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-vancouver-11
Leticia F.,"Vancouver, WA",4,17,6,2.0,3/1/2017,I went in with a group of 6 and had a funny and attentive male server.  The host were chit chatting work gossip loud enough we heard who was fu**ing who!  To top things off I had left my purse and realized when I got home. Called and spoke with a host who said no purse was left or there and even after I insisted it had to be there she told me no. I drove back and spoke to a manger and they had my purse... Drinks are always good at Applebee's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-vancouver-11
Brenda W.,"Vancouver, WA",37,2,,1.0,8/15/2017,"We still haven't stepped foot in Applebee's on 12717 SE 2nd Circle Vancouver Washington. The manager apologized on that day and promised a gift card via email. Never received an email. Oh well, we've spent lots of $ at nearby establishments. Applebee's loss continues.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-vancouver-11
Elyse M.,"Washougal, WA",194,121,130,1.0,10/16/2017,"I haven't been to an Applebees in a REALLY LONG time! Food was really poorly made and service was less than exceptional. We had a group of 5 with one child. It's pretty bad when you order a meal and it's so unappetizing that you cash out and go to another place. We did appetizers to start which admittingly were pretty good. We had the chicken wonton tacos... so good, the boneless wings... meh, and steak quesadilla...good. For dinner we did the 2 for $20. My better half and I both ordered buffalo chicken strips for our main course. They were so over cooked and had barely any sauce on them. It was awful. One of the people with us ordered the oriental salad and asked for the dressing on the side. They brought her a salad loaded with dressing plus an additional sauce on the side, not at all what she asked for. Our waitress was even less impressive than the food. We were all drinking beer but I really wanted a water (surprised we weren't given any when we sat down, not even the child got a water) Anyways, I think we asked 7 or 8 different times for 2 waters and didn't get them until we were basically leaving. when it came time for the bill, the tablet on our table didn't work. We asked several times for our check explaining to her it wasn't working. When she finally brought it over we went to hand her a card and she was already gone. We were so frustrated with the entire night, we gathered enough cash to pay our bill and leave. I used to like going here but man I don't know what happened in the year I hadn't been here but it is so awful now I wouldn't go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-vancouver-11
Brandi K.,"Vancouver, WA",144,489,759,4.0,6/21/2016,I've had a love/hate relationship with Applebees for years. Sometimes it's great and sometimes it's just plain awful. Most of the time I'm there for happy hour and you just can't beat the half-priced appetizers. You can get stuffed to the brim for under $20 for 2 people. Add in a couple of their happy hour drinks and you're good to go. Service is almost always top-notch. Our most recent server was a blast! Late night happy hour is the best to avoid children screeching in the restaurant portion.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-vancouver-11
Sandra B.,"Vancouver, WA",40,9,8,1.0,7/29/2017,Worse service I have ever had! Not even busy. Food was cold and tasteless. Had to wait 10 minutes just for a soda and then she brought it in a to go cup. I did not ask for a to go cup. She was short with myself and my husband. She brought our food and just threw it on the table and continued on her way. No napkins with our dessert. I am very dissatisfied.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-vancouver-11
Micah C.,"Vancouver, WA",4,26,,2.0,11/29/2016,"I've gone several times before, and been satisfied. The last time I went, however, it seems their entire menu had changed for the worse. Everything we ordered came in tiny, unsatisfying, and overpriced portions. My friend and I were mystified, as we'd eaten there three times a couple months ago, and always been very happy with the portion sizes. My enchiladas were the saddest, tiny little things, with a heap of rice. Everyone left still very hungry and disappointed, but looking at the portion sizes and the prices, we figured we'd have to pay double-to-triple a normal meal's cost in order to feel full. We couldn't even order dessert, because the only desserts they have on the new menu are different variations of ""brownie and ice cream"", which no one wanted. WTF. We decided to stop by Shari's to buy a couple pies to have at home, so we could actually end our night feeling full. I'll never hit Applebee's again, here or any other location (I assume it's probably the result of the recent company-wide menu change). Go next door to McGraff's, where you can actually fill up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-vancouver-11
Max I.,"Portland, OR",30,25,,3.0,5/30/2017,Just OK for me.  The staff were slow to recognize me.  In fact there was no bartender for about 5 minutes and then when she came out with no acknowledgement I thought about leaving.  The food is good.  The drinks are corporate to the max.  No worry about over pours here.  This particular Applebee's is a little too family friendly for me.  I mostly drive by it now but would go there in a pinch.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-vancouver-11
Mag M.,"Vancouver, WA",0,13,,1.0,9/25/2017,Always screwing up our order. Messy. Small portions. Last time I went they gave my twins a raw burger. Disgusted I was glad I checked it first before giving it to them!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-vancouver-11

Anna M.,"Portland, OR",15,11,1,3.0,3/16/2017,"Decent food, we order to go frequently but do check your order if you asked to not include onions or for a different sauce - they tend to ignore or forget about specific requests...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-vancouver-11
Matt C.,"Lindsay, CA",1,21,5,4.0,3/11/2017,Food was great. Service was kind. They did forget a salad for our table. But the drinks were filled as soon as they were empty. We were there just for the happy hour appetizers. I will be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-vancouver-11
Kayla L.,"Vancouver, WA",198,191,238,5.0,9/26/2015,"I went to this location last night and had a great experience! We went a few minutes before 6 to get happy hour. We were thinking it would be too busy to get a seat right away since it was a Friday night but we didn't have to wait. Our waiter (Tyler I think) had many tables he was waiting on but he made sure we were taken care of. I love Applebee's new burgers! Also, their happy hour menu has good choices for a good price. We will definitely be going back to this Applebee's soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-vancouver-11
John C.,"Greenville, SC",26,352,10,2.0,3/21/2015,"At the end of the experience, we were reminded exactly why we don't eat at Applebee's any longer.  The short version is because the food isn't that good.  We ordered a grilled chicken ceaser salad.  Additional dressing was requested because it felt lacking but even with additional dressing, the salad didn't taste great, The biggest fail was the service.  If you ask me if I want a drink and I say a Bud Lite pint and you say ok and disappear, don't you dare come back and ask my another question unless you bring me my simple draft beer.  If I have to ask twice for my beer, I'm done spending money here.  At $3.25 for a Bud Lite pint during Happy Hour, the service had damn well better be amazing! We agreed not to visit this Applebee's location again no matter what and realized that maybe Applebee's is not the place for us anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-vancouver-11
Wendy B.,"Vancouver, WA",3,2,,1.0,10/16/2016,We have been here many times.Usually it is good food.However we went there yesterday and it was awful.Our chips were stale so we sent them back and ordered onion rings which were raw on the inside.A female manager came and said she was going to give us bread but we ordered onion rings.She appeared intoxicated.She said she would not charge us for our app but she did.When we got our meal the rice was a day or so old.We were so hungry we are it!!it wasnt busy...we wasted 25 bucks!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-vancouver-11
David H.,"Sun Prairie, WI",19,481,270,2.0,4/19/2016,This is a decent Applebees with okservice and nice food.

Pam B.,"Vancouver, WA",0,34,3,2.0,12/3/2015,"We eat weekly at Applebee's.  Usually the salads, (trying to cut some lbs) Tried the fiesta chicken salad 11.99 wow was about 1-1/2 cups salad.  Looked like it had been placed under that heat lamp with hot food too.  Lettuce was all wilted, and it was about the size of a side salad?

Jennifer O.,"Battle Ground, WA",0,12,1,2.0,9/4/2016,Have always loved Applebee's and was disappointed in our food. Service was good. Got the fiesta chicken lime and the chicken and the rice was dry.
