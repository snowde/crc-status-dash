Michael H.,"Gatesville, TX",0,4,,3.0,1/8/2018,"Food is very good, management is professional, wait staff is lacking general abilities.

Paulette S.,"McGregor, TX",145,78,18,2.0,1/29/2017,"We have eaten at Applebees all across the US, have always enjoyed the food. We have noticed a decline in the qualty of food and portions. We realize that falls on coporate and say shame on them. Tonight it took almost 30 minutes for our meal to be served and they were salads! Mine was mostly white/yellow romaine and the portion was small, my husbands was served with his meat being over cooked and cold.  We did not notice a manger in house and the staff was gathered right by us and it's sad to hear them complain about the earlier shift. Just no management. Sad....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waco-3
Lu-Shien T.,"Portola, San Francisco, CA",707,299,2069,2.0,3/30/2016,"We were there as guests in a party of 4 adults and 2 teens. Our server was wonderful--hats off to her! We ordered 2 pairs from the 2 entrees and 1 Appetizer for $25: Appetizer 1: Mozzarella Sticks--so-so, I have had better Appetizer 2: Mild Boneless Wings. The breading was rubbery and the sauce really flat Entree 1: Mac n Cheese--my daughter really liked it Entree 2: Half Order of Ribs--they were dry and the glaze tasted painted on last minute Entree 3: Fried Shrimp--these tasted very flat and bland too Entree 4: Bourbon Steak. To all of our surprise, it came out as ordered, still medium cooked. And it was tender, juicy and tasted great. I had the Flaming Texan burger which also tasted great, but was a bit small. Maybe I will upsize it with another patty for just $3 in future. In all, I had mixed feelings about the visit--the food was either good, or really bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waco-3
Robert B.,"Harrisonburg, VA",0,13,3,2.0,8/6/2017,"We were in town for a meeting in Dallas, visitng Waco to see the Magnolia Market. We decided to eat hear on a Saturday evening the place is very grungy and the windows were so dirty you could barely see out of them, the waitress was very nice and she seated us at a booth, the table top was so sticky your arms would stick to it. We asked to be moved to another booth which she promptly did.........that one was just about as bad, the tables were so worn that they couldnt get them clean if they wanted to.

Ken L.,"Cleveland, TX",0,57,44,3.0,5/16/2017,Stopped in for lunch.  Food was great.  Service was also great. Had a wait person in training and she did a wonderful job.  Loved the spinach dip appetizer.  Seating was great. It was about 11:30ish so not a big crowd to contend with.  My only complaint is with Applebees decision to be ANTI GUN. They have chosen to not allow ANY licensed carry.  Because of this I will seriously consider not returning.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waco-3

Who does a shift change in the middle of dinner time??? Applebee's needs to hire new management who will bust ass, bring in business (instead of B.S. like this), and have the ability to not only lead, but assist their employees!

Kris R.,"Hewitt, TX",0,91,14,4.0,10/19/2016,Been here 4+ times in last year. Each experience has been met with average service or slightly better . They took away the great Queso and chips whole family loved. The same can be said on food taste. Most entrees have been middle of road. Although they have some new items Grilled entrees that were quite tasty. I recommend to Daughter who went and thought so as well. Mixed Drinks can be hit or miss quality. Little to no alcohol. One recent experience upset me in that I am fed up with their tabletops. They need to be refinished they are getting nasty. Otherwise it is usually a pleasant dining experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waco-3

She told them it would be 30 mins for a booth! We asked about ours and she said ""yeah for you also."" So we left. As the first person potential customers see you should have much better customer service, make the customers feel welcomed and excited to eat.

Carolyn G.,"Waco, TX",28,17,2,1.0,5/10/2016,"Hello FAMILY !! Mothers Day weekend is over and it was a beautiful day !! I had an incident this weekend , but because I didn't want it to weigh on my heart and mind .. I didn't share but now that I have had time to register this and I am no longer in a rage I shall share !! Now mind you this statement is not to sway you in any direction .. Just my experience and if you feel SOME TYPE OF WAY PLEASE SHARE  On Saturday May 7 , I had the most horrible experience at your establishment Valley Mills in Waco , Texas .. Upon enter Applebee's with my daughter 11, my two nieces ages 5 , 7 .. We were seated by a very nice hostess !! When our waitres came to table , I informed her that my kids had a coupon for a free Kids Meal .. ( Good grades ) she ok , she read card and an said my manager will have to come talk to you !  I said fine can they order there drinks , because my intent was to stay regardless of  free meal ticket .  the girls got a white milk a chocolate milk and a Sprite .. I had water .. We waited .. And waited for manager ... Who I felt didn't feel my concern was an issue because it took him 10- 12 minutes to even addres my table .. So when he does come , he explains it  2 per visit !!  Ok that mean that two of my kids can use the free card , he said yes , I then told him my other older niece was coming with her son so they along with the one child o had could use the other .. He said yes , but she can't sit with you ... I said she can't sit with us , he said that's right .. I said .. So she has to take up a completely different table .. I said that silly when she could just sit with us .. My niece entered at that time .. He then stated  well you can with either sit at another table or I'm not gonna serve you ... My niece than said I don't want to eat here , I said lets go cause he said I'm not gonna serve us anyway , this manager Jim Quechroeii , than said well y'all CAN PAY YOUR TAB AND GET YOUR ASS OUT !!! I told my niece to take the kids to car .. She exited the building with children .. I went to pay tab , I told him that was very disrespectful for you to speak that way in front of children , JIM SAID ... I can say what I want ,.. YALL PEOPLE MAD CAUSE I WONT GIVE YOU FREE FOOD .. Again ( racial ) . I told him nobody wanted food , my word were "" shit I got money "" ! He Jim said you will never eat in MY RESTURANT AGAIN! I said to him you dnt OWN APPLEBEES , he said YES I DO THIS IS MY RESTURANT ! He then began to yell at me and stated "" Why Don't you go back on the crack pipe your on "" ( insinuating I was a crack head) .. I told you are a sorry SOB.. He got in my face and said Didn't I tell you to shut your mouth , I waited for my change and yes the entire time we were both exchanging words , because at this time I had no respect for him. My change was 83 cents .. He took 95 cents out of his own pocket and said take this and there a there is little tip for you !! Again I am out raged , as he ushered me out of the building he continued to tell me I would never eat there in HIS RESTURANT AGAIN , I yelled back at him and said "" you would probably spit in "" he commented "" if it's your I will"" he proceeded to write our liscense plate down and said dnt leave the police will be hear .. Because he had one of his MINIONS INSIDE call them .. My niece and I waited in parking lot for around 6-7 min no police .. I left and went down street, my nice called and said "" Auntie he just came to my window beating on glass "" why are y'all leaving , running from police .. "" I came back .. When I returned , there were over 7 or 8 carloads of cops !! Jim  told the dispatch that someone said it was going to be another twin Peaks situation!!  Now number one , This Manager who said he was the owner was RUDE , disrespectful, made several racist remarks, using word like YALL, you people, making assumptions that I was on crack !!!! And then putting me my child and family in danger... Him saying there was terroristic threat .. Supposed we had a trigger happy cop !! Suppose someone wanted to be a hero , considering we have open carry law !! I will not rest until actions are taken against this manager (OWNER ) and if this is what APPLEBEES STAND FOR !! BUT I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO DISRESPECTED !!  Excuse langue !!   #gladJesusisinmylife",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waco-3
Greg F.,"Rancho Santa Fe, CA",10,13,,1.0,5/26/2016,"Ordered the Fiesta Chicken and it was cold. I told the waitress and she apologized and said she would have them make another one for me. 15 minutes later the food came back and it was the SAME piece of chicken only now it was burned on the bottom. They didn't even put new rice on the plate and it was the same cold rice from the beginning! When I told the waitress, she didn't even offer to take it off of the bill.

Marc K.,"Waco, TX",2,27,11,1.0,5/28/2015,"This could possibly be the worst restaurant in Waco I'm sorry to say this but I must warn anyone who thinks this might be a good place to eat that they would be better off going to the Salvation Army and asking for the scraps from the soup line. Our food tasted like it had been swimming in a freezer bag with brine or some other unknown liquid. It obviously was microwaved. It was soggy and tasteless.  I would have complained but fear the remedy would be a free meal and a gift card. Neither of which would change my experience. The restaurant feels dirty, overall the staff seems nice but thoroughly untrained.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waco-3
Mike L.,"Woodway, TX",0,1,,1.0,2/26/2016,"I don't really write reviews, but this was awful. I like Applebee's food, but hadn't been to this location yet. I walked in with my wife and 3 kids, and the employee acted like finding a table for five in a half-empty restaurant was going to be a chore. He said ""five, five, five... hmmmm"", and left for a few minutes before returning, and explaining this dilemma to his manager 'Jim'. The two proceeded to ignore my family while they talked to each other about another employee who wouldn't answer their phone and come in. Not the kind of chatter I'd expect them to have right in front of us... while we were waiting to just sit down. Eventually, manager 'Jim' waved at us (not bothering to otherwise acknowledge or greet us) and started walking us to our table. When we finally were seated, we placed our order. My wife and I were splitting a 2 for 20, which includes an appetizer and two entrees. The appetizer never came, and eventually the entrees showed up. We waited for a long time... drinks empty by now... to have a chance to tell the waitress we never received our appetizer. The waitress asked if we still wanted it, and we said yes. I also ordered another drink. Another long period of time passed... still no appetizer or drink. The waitress told us multiple times both were 'on their way'. Then, she told me the bartender had disappeared and she didn't know when I'd get my beer. I told her to cancel the order. She did, and promised the appetizer would be right up. Another 10 minutes or so, and waitress came back and asked if we still wanted the appetizer. I said, no please cancel it. She said she'd talk to her manager Jim to take it off the bill. She came back with the check, and the bill was HIGHER than it would have been with the appetizer. They had removed the '2 for 20' deal, charging for the two individual entrees, leading to a higher price. I explained that I wanted the price of the appetizer taken OFF the check, and that this actually added to the price. She promised Jim would get it fixed. This took 20 minutes. My family was miserable by this point, and went out to the car. Eventually, the waitress came back with the bill EXACTLY AS IT STARTED. They were charging me for the full '2 for 20' again. I tried to explain to the waitress that they should remove the cost of the individual appetizer from my bill. Manager Jim was 5 feet away in the corner by the register, clearly making a point not to make eye contact or acknowledge our table. I actually felt bad for our waitress. I think she was trying to help, and Jim was just refusing to let her. I ended up just paying the bill, rather than sending our poor waitress back to Jim again. Overall, a miserable experience. Sadly, I won't ever be returning to this location again until a big 'under new management' sign is hanging outside.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waco-3

Silvia W.,"Waco, TX",0,2,,1.0,11/6/2016,"Years ago this was one of our favorite restaurants until either they got bought out or something because their menu and taste went dramatically downhill . Last night we thought we would give it another go since it had been over a year and unfortunately discovered nothing has changed. My grilled chicken Caesar salad had no seasoning on the chicken. It was just plain grilled chicken over salad and croutons with a little Caesar dressing. Nothing special and certainly not worth the $10. My husband's nachos actually tasted sort of funny. When I took a bite of the ground beef by itself without any of the toppings I suspected it was actually spoiled. Another $10 wasted. Not to mention that the hostess seemed not to understand her job as she kept staring at us and not saying a word after welcoming us, until we suggested we might like to sit.  Won't be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waco-3
Jean S.,"Fountain Hills, AZ",26,124,34,2.0,10/29/2015,"So far there was no one at the station to seat us. Then it took almost what seemed like 10 minutes before someone was there with a few servers in a not so busy place dashing by. It seemed the server,though very pleasant kept forgetting us. We ordered an appetizer and a classic and two brunch burgers. All very good. However the appetizer was served with the entree. Asked for to go cups another 8 minutes it seemed. Then the check. Had to track him down by waving the bill and he smiled and said ""sorry they got me running here""   Let's see. About 10 or 12 people, an empty bar, lunch time and 3 servers. Stop and chat with two servers before coming for check. I would hate to see what it's like when really busy.

Heather M.,"Woodway, TX",12,19,1,1.0,5/9/2016,My husband and I went there for Mother's Day. It was later in the evening and was not very busy at all. Our waitress was rude and did not take care of us at all. She took our order but then had to come back to our table 10 minutes later to ask us what we ordered because she couldn't read her own handwriting. After 45 minutes we received our burgers but realized they were completely wrong. We had to flag her down so that she could correct our orders. When are Burgers came back to the table for the second time they still were not right. We didn't have time to place an order for the third time so we just ate what we had. The table next to us had been waiting for 2 hours to get their food and even by the time we finished our meals they still have not gotten theirs. The manager was wonderful he corrected our tickets and comp the burgers and did the same for the table next to us.

The bartender finally arrives to the area, promptly takes care of the guy that came in after us- he orders a water with lemon. I thought this was OK because he may know him. So the bartender did not acknowledge our presence when he first came in the area,  the next act was most shocking. After serving the water he leaned his butt against a cooler and started a conversation with the guy. Totally ignoring us. We left. Applebee's seems to have a culture of ""I don't care"".
