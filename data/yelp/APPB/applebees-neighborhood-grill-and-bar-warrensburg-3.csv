Randy T.,"Warrensburg, MO",0,4,,5.0,8/12/2017,It's no small wonder their closing over 100 locations. Although Warrensburg needs restaurants Applebee's is not one. Food is constantly served cold or just not eatable. Recently ordered a signature steak meal. Delivered cold and tougher than John Wayne. Took two bites and that was it. Server noticed I hadn't eaten and never once offered to replace or even ask what was wrong. Would rather buy fast food than eat at Applebee's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-warrensburg-3
David S.,"Fort Leonard Wood, MO",88,15,6,2.0,7/25/2017,"""If hell exists, it's an eternity of waiting in an Applebees"" - Me Okay, so maybe I'm being a little critical, but I have been to this Applebees on several occasions and usually order the same damn thing. Buffalo Chicken Tenders. I may not be the smartest individual, but I'm fairly confident that the ones at every Applebees serves is either frozen or prepped the day before, then super nuked in a super microwave when ordered. Why does every time I order it at this Applebees, the wait just seems to drag on forever? Granted, the servers are generally professional and the tenders don't taste terrible. I just feel that more than 45 minutes for chicken tenders not during the lunch rush hour is too much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-warrensburg-3
Matthew S.,"Warrensburg, MO",6,104,88,2.0,7/23/2017,"I love Applebee's but this location just seems to lack with everything. The staff seem dead inside, I usually order the same thing all the time and everything we ordered tasted funny like something was off. It's was hot inside the location and no shade blinds for the windows. I'll go back to my normal location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-warrensburg-3
Sean R.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,50,,2.0,12/12/2015,"Not the greatest experience, but it was good.  First off, I was seated at a table that wobbled and rocked back and forth. Didn't want to ask to move and be ""one of those people"" so I tried to enjoy my meal. Waitress was very friendly, helpful, and did an excellent job. Came for refills without me even needing to ask. I tried the Cowboy Burger and was happy with the taste of it but I couldn't believe how small of a burger it was for the price. Almost found myself thinking, is this some kind of child's meal that I was given by mistake? Bacon was crisp and onion strings were good, just not very flavorful. BBQ sauce was unique, but nothing spectacular. Beef was tender and tasted good, but again, much too small for the price. The French fries were crisp but not great, also a very small portion.  On the way out three employees had their backs to me and not even one went out of their way to acknowledge me or say a word or reach to open the door. At least someone could have said something.. any acknowledgement would be better than nothing.. Overall, I would eat here again, just not anytime soon..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-warrensburg-3
Daniel H.,"Warrensburg, MO",30,10,8,2.0,5/24/2015,"Applebee's rolls out a new menu....with it, they seem to be rolling out some type of - portion control? We have been Applebee's customers for over 17 years now. My wife has always loved the spinach/artichoke dip. We have always shared this in the past, but with the mew menu size, it really isn't meant for sharing any more. I mean, I truly get eating healthy, but portion control on appetizers? For real!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-warrensburg-3
Julie Simbro A.,"Warrensburg, MO",158,14,24,5.0,6/3/2014,"Overall, this Applebee's exceeded our expectations!  We ordered from the Weight Watchers approved items and were blown away by the flavor in these dishes!  Both the Lemon Parmesan Shrimp and the Strawberry Avocado salad were amazing! All throughout our meal, Ashley, our server was attentive.  She checked on us multiple times without being obtrusive.  At the end of our meal, she managed to talk us into dessert.  She suggested the brownie bites or the Blondie bites because they were small - totally cancelled out the weight watchers lunches but was definitely worth it!  She did an excellent job and exceeded both of our expectations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-warrensburg-3
Todd B.,"Higginsville, MO",0,19,11,4.0,8/28/2015,We usually tip really good because our food is hot all the time and the service we get is pretty good. Usually get the ribs but I will probably try the mac and  the honey pepper chicken this time but this place doesn't set big groups all to well. But still good service and good here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-warrensburg-3
John J.,"Holden, MO",14,53,,1.0,2/24/2015,"The sirloin tasted like processed meat...not at all like steak. The bloody mary was sub-par. And the onions rings were greasy. (My wife's baked potato had a good flavor, according to her).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-warrensburg-3
Richard C.,"Lawrence, KS",0,12,2,3.0,3/2/2015,"One star for cleanliness. One star for quality of service. One star for convenient location from 50 highway.  I ordered the cheeseburger.  I think that should be easy enough. Guess not. It was dripping with grease. When I mentioned this the response was ""it's juicy"".  Okay?  I'll not be stopping here again. If I do I'll stick with microwaved food. Commercial restaurants in my opinion needs to taste the same in every location,  every time.  I came to eat not look at the cute waitress.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-warrensburg-3
Brittany W.,"Higginsville, MO",8,35,,2.0,8/10/2014,I only eat here for half off appetizers. I would never pay full price for the food here. It's all frozen food. The drinks are ok but sometimes I think they forgot to add the alcohol. Service is usually friendly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-warrensburg-3
Christopher M.,"Whiteman AFB, MO",61,20,6,3.0,1/17/2015,"Been coming here for a while and pretty consistently seeing as it's really the only restaurant around that isn't fast food, but very inconsistent. One night the food will be great then the next it's terrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-warrensburg-3
James B.,"Warrensburg, MO",12,19,,2.0,1/2/2015,"Went here with my family today. I ordered a bowl of shrimp broccoli pasta. 13 dollars and the bowl was tiny. The sauce was boring and there was little broccoli. Way over priced for what you get. I have been to Applebee's before, and I guess maybe I expected too much. We will not be going there again. Ugh. Plus the table was too small for my family and though our waitress was nice she was over worked and busy. Oh well. Lesson learned.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-warrensburg-3
Jax W.,"Warrensburg, MO",0,27,5,4.0,12/24/2015,"Compared to other Applebee's this one has one of the best services. Although sometimes the food quality isn't the most consistent but if you let them know they are more than happy to swap it out or make it right for you. Speed of service is pretty good and you can always let them know you're in a hurry and they will speed up the process.  Overall in town,  one of the better restaurants to go to for an affordable meal and have a good time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-warrensburg-3
Rebecca S.,"Tampa, FL",117,357,4,3.0,6/22/2012,"Applebee's is Applebee's, no matter where you go.  Service was good, and the staff was polite. The food came out hot and as ordered, and they were great with my young nieces. There's not much choice in Warrensburg, MO, but it seems as though Applebee's isn't taking that for granted.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-warrensburg-3
