Linda C.,"Warwick, RI",6,70,3,3.0,1/8/2015,"My husband and I don't frequent chain restaurants on a regular basis, but decided to give Applebee's another try.  We came here on a Friday night around 7pm and we were seated after a couple minutes.  The place was packed as almost every table was filled.  Our waitress was friendly and good for the most part, with the exception of not refilling our drinks.  We decided to take order from their 2 for $25 menu which included 1 appetizer to share and 2 entrees from a selected menu.  We chose to get the Caesar salad which they actually gave us each our own plate.  It was perfectly dressed and the lettuce was fresh.  I ordered the half rack of ribs with the honey barbeque sauce and my husband ordered the sirloin with roasted potatoes.  The ribs were fall off the bone and really delicious.  It came with fries and a side of cole slaw.  The sirloin came out on a sizzling hot plate and was cooked to my husband's liking of medium rare.  Overall, the service was fast and friendly.  We wouldn't be opposed to coming here again when we are in the mood for a chain restaurant.  Ps:  We did see they have a burger special on Mondays -- $5.99 for all burgers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-warwick-3?start=20
Natalie S.,"Fernandina Beach, FL",23,191,10,4.0,5/16/2014,"Service was quick and pleasant. The food came out smoking hot, the plates were hot. It was very affordable. Easy quick dinner! Excellent!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-warwick-3?start=20
C G.,"Hope, RI",29,20,1,5.0,4/11/2014,"Gave these guys one more shot. I don't know if there is a difference in cooks between lunch and dinner but we ordered a ""2 for $20"" for lunch. I am diabetic and they had no problem making substitutions, except a house or Caesar salad was $1.29 more, no big deal, I've seen other places charge more for less. Steaks cooked to perfection, mozzarella sticks perfectly cooked and yummy (I am limited to only 2 so woohoo snack tomorrow). Check it out. They added stuff to their menu. My husband had the new steak. It's mildly spicy but was pretty darn good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-warwick-3?start=20
Andrea R.,"Providence, RI",241,162,95,3.0,11/15/2012,Food and Service was okay. Typical chain restaurant to grab a quick bite to eat or a drink!  Appetizers are 1/2 off after 9 which is cool but I never seem to remember this.  This location recently renovated/redecorated and I'm not a fan of the new decorations/lighting but I would go again.  Curious to see what the other Applebee's in RI look like.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-warwick-3?start=20
Meghan P.,"West Warwick, RI",2,4,,3.0,11/1/2014,"This Applebee's is always a hit or a miss - more often a miss. I come here at least once a month for take out, god knows why, and most of the time it comes out messy and disgusting. When you're sitting down and eating, it's another story. Possibly because they know they'll get remanded if it's this horrible. All in all, don't get the take out/car side.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-warwick-3?start=20
Stressed O.,"Woonsocket, RI",0,3,,1.0,9/16/2014,Slow slow service 15 min to get a soda Lana is not a good waitress at all or needs more more training .,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-warwick-3?start=20
Peter L.,"Warwick, RI",0,6,,3.0,3/23/2014,Food was just average. I had the ribs and there was little meat on them It was 20 degrees outside and they had the AC on. We were freezing and couldn't wait to get out of there. My food got cold in seconds.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-warwick-3?start=20
Jen C.,"Johnston, RI",0,6,,5.0,12/8/2017,"I stopped in around 8:00 pm this evening, to purchase gift cards for Christmas. I was very impressed by your server, Nick. He came right over, greeted me with, ""How are you this evening"", with a welcoming smile and fully explained to me about the program you have going on, purchasing so much in gift cards and receive 10.00 bonus cards. He was fantastic!! It is very hard to find great workers with a wonderful personality, and Nick was awesome!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-warwick-3
Tom W.,"Warwick, RI",22,57,28,1.0,10/14/2017,"Came here today because of the one dollar margaritas. After four, I came to the conclusion that there is no booze in these one dollar margaritas. If I wanted to get a Grand Marnier topper it would be an additional eight dollars. Nice bait and switch try but I understand now why they're  not very busy. Save your money",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-warwick-3
Joseph B.,"Beaumont, CA",97,79,6,1.0,10/7/2017,"In Warwick to run some errands so I decided to stop by Applebee's for some food. I sat at the bar and ordered and then waited a long time for my food. When my food finally came I opened my silverware and noticed that there was still food residue in the fork....  So I tried to get Maegan's attention and she either cannot hear or just ignored me. When I finally got her attention I asked for a new set of silverware and she says, ""would you like me to just lick it clean for you?"" lol wooooooow. Your neighborhood Applebee's, ladies and gentlemen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-warwick-3
Rainelle R.,"Warwick, RI",76,7,1,4.0,10/6/2017,"I tried Applebee's for the first time tonight, and was very satisfied leaving. Although there was a little wait, I think it was well worth it. Julie was our server and she was very friendly and fast. Definitely had some great drinks, food and service and I look forward to going again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-warwick-3

Jenn R.,"Coventry, RI",31,5,,1.0,1/23/2017,"If I could give no stars I would. Took my daughter there yesterday, I ordered a cheeseburger and she ordered the Mac and cheese. We waited like 45 min for our food, then, my burger looked like it fell apart so they used the cheese to put the pieces back together, not to mention it was so over cooked it was crunchy.  Then my daughter noticed her Mac and cheese looked like soup, there was so much sauce from the chicken.  Very disappointed, the manager apologized, but actually tried to tell me the Mac and cheese was supposed to look like that,  I just asked him if he was serious, she orders that all the time, usually it's just lacking cheese.  I emailed photos of the food to customer relations, still haven't heard back from them, let's see if we do.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-warwick-3
Mark F.,"East Greenwich, RI",0,1,,5.0,8/8/2017,Just had a great lunch. Bags is a great asset the the restaurant. Always a good value and great drinks,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-warwick-3
Jen W.,"Milan, Italy",55,345,1607,3.0,1/1/2016,"The Applebee's located on Rt 2, in the Stop & Shop plaza is a skip and a jump from my home so we will stop in here from time to time for a quick lunch or dinner.  The menu changed recently and there is lots more beef now, along with chicken, a bit of shrimp and couple of fish dishes.  The salads all seem to have some sort of meat in them, bacon or chicken, but I suppose you can ask them to leave the meat out if you are a vegetarian. The staff seems pleasant, the booths are clean and the food standard fare.  Nothing to rave or complain about, just what you'd expect from your chain restaurant.  During the day it's nice and sunny inside with large windows along either side of the restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-warwick-3
Josh C.,"Johnston, RI",3,13,1,4.0,6/22/2016,"I come here for lunch on occasion when I am in the area visiting my girlfriend at work. We will  hit up this Applebee's for some 1/2 price appetizers and a quick lunch. The place is usually pretty empty around 2pm, usually you see a couple booths and the bar occupied with the older retirement crowd. Pretty quiet for the most part. The waitresses are always friendly and laid back - not enough customers to get stressed over.  I'm a big fan of the spinach artichoke dip and they are very accommodating when I ask for lettuce wraps on my burgers (I don't eat bread).  One down side is that the service an be pretty slow, not sure if its due to the lack of pressure from an empty dining room or that's just the way they roll here. When my girlfriend only gets an hour for lunch we sometimes find ourselves rushing through our meals so she can make it back to work in time.  All in all I the experience here is usually very positive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-warwick-3
Rachel M.,"North Kingstown, RI",2,9,3,4.0,1/26/2016,I love this Applebee's I come here a lot with friends and my sister. We like the half priced apps after 9pm and the Long Island iced teas for 5.25!  Just recently tried a dish off their new pub diet. I had the cedar grilled lemon chicken it was very delicious.  The servers here are always friendly and they are well trained on the menus and drinks. I have never had any issues here at all!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-warwick-3
Christine D.,"Warwick, RI",43,191,9,5.0,4/15/2015,"Although not a big fan of Applebees in recent years, I was alerted to the great burger and fantastic deal offered only on Mondays from 4PM to Midnight.  The triple bacon burger with fries for a total of six dollars was a juicy, tasty treat. The burger was cooked as ordered and  service was excellent.  In looking at the entire menu, it seems that they have also added some healthy selections, but that's not in the same price range as that wonderful burger.  So  on a Monday evening when you are in the mood for an inexpensive meaty delight, Applebees is definitely the place to go!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-warwick-3
Brian B.,"East Greenwich, RI",0,9,,4.0,11/26/2016,"Usually go at least once per week, sometimes twice, for the 1/2-priced late night apps and the burger specials on Mondays.

Steven S.,"Pawtucket, RI",27,47,14,4.0,5/19/2015,"This place gets 4 stars due to how awesome their staff is. Best described as fiery, their staff isn't afraid of giving you some good natured sass. You feel like you are at a family member's house while you're here. Food comes out pretty quickly at lunch when I've been here. I recommend this place if for no other reason than a good laugh at the bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-warwick-3
Nicole G.,"Coventry, RI",8,23,34,4.0,5/11/2015,"Had a good time. Went out with some friends and sat at the bar. Let me just say, Katie is an awesome bar tender.

J R.,"Warwick, RI",0,27,1,4.0,11/3/2015,"I have to admit, I went to Applebee's three years ago at their Coventry, RI location. And at that time I was less than impressed with the food they served. But a relation suggested Applebee's to try. I said ok I'll give it a try. The food has done a 360 in my book. A lot better and more flavorful than previous. Staff was very friendly and attentive. It was a pleasure to dine here and would come back again. Sorry, I didn't give 5 stars.

Tina Z.,"Warwick, RI",51,214,2,4.0,1/20/2013,"The manager at this location is great.  He comes over to your table and asks how everything is going and if you have any reccommendations to make it better.  I had to write a review because when do you ever get that kind of service?    IMHO, the food is great.  I tend to order from the WW menu since I try to be concious of my food choices especially when dining out.  I love that i can see the nutritional information and I don't have to worry about hidden calories in my grilled chicken and vegetables.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-warwick-3
Michael D.,"West Warwick, RI",12,10,6,5.0,8/6/2014,"Baggs, the bartender at this Applebee's, treats me like a king.  She sees my car pull into the parking lot and my beer is poured and served when I walk in.  She sets a pleasant atmosphere in her bar and has countless regular customers.  The guest experience is her primary concern and it is quite evident that everyone is having a great time.  She also makes sure that the food is served piping hot and in accordance with the guests specifications.

Andelaine S.,"Warwick, RI",20,1,,3.0,3/19/2015,"Johnny  We were nothing but nice to you! Why did you have to rush us like that? We were getting together with our friend from new York and he rushed us out. One of us was still in the middle of eating our salad when you dropped the check we were at the table for only 45 min. Not camping out. He was nice in the beginning and at some point the tables turned. We wanted to like you. Please don't do this to another table. Coming from a fellow waiter, please don't rush your tables take time to get to know them and why they are there. If it's a situation like ours, let your table catch up. Be nice. Your tips will be higher I promise.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-warwick-3
