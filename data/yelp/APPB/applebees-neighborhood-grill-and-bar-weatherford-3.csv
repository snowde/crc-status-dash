Tamara C.,"Hamilton, TX",6,5,,1.0,8/17/2015,"I usually always look at yelp before we choose a place to eat, today I didn't and regret it. We have don't usually eat at Applebee's just because there are not any locations around where we live. I will say the food was really good, but sadly it was horribly overshadowed by the horrible service. Our waitress would disappear in to the back for 5-10 mins at a time, when she did come back she would look straight at us but never actually come over there. My husband's empty drink was sitting on the edge of the table, she look right at it but never asked if he needed a refill or even came our way. We finally asked another waiter to get him a refill. We finished our meal and placed our napkins on the plate and set them to the edge of the table and waited, she had disappeared in to the back again. When she finally came back out I just stared her down till she had little choice to come over there, and she didn't even come all the way to us, just spoke loudly from the register. She got our check and disappeared AGAIN, we waited for nearly 15 mins before finally asking another waiter who came by if he could cash it out for us. No amount of good food would make me want to put up with that sorry excuse for service again!!! Our waitress's name was Angie BTW.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-weatherford-3?start=20
Lyn A.,"Keller, TX",2,25,3,1.0,1/26/2015,My friend James Hardin went to weatherford Applebee's on Friday.  Server admitted to forging the tip amount and all they want to refund is the forced $10.  Refund entire check to James Hardin or you won't hear the end of it.  #bbb #forgery #theft #relentless.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-weatherford-3?start=20
Renee S.,"Aledo, TX",0,4,,1.0,1/11/2016,"NASTY!! Just keep driving and go to another Applebee's location!  This Weatherford location is filthy!   The lights on the outside of the building weren't even turned on - on a Thursday night (6:30pm)!  WE had to inform staff to turn them on and they laughed and said, ""Haha this happens all the time!"" Our waiter was poorly trained and awkward.  The mixed drinks were mediocre at best- the margarita on-the-rocks came with NO ICE??  The food was average quality. No wonder that only about 4-5 tables were seated when every other restaurant in town has a line out the door at this time!  If we hadn't had a gift card to use, we'd never have stopped in.  We will NOT return.  I'm sure it will be closing soon anyway unless their corporate offices step in PRONTO and hire competent management to save this place!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-weatherford-3?start=20
Mark W.,"Mineral Wells, TX",0,1,,1.0,6/7/2014,There where 2 people on the staff that was not getting along one of them was the mang I found out and she was very imperial and talk down to the other one  .

Abi J.,"Weatherford, TX",0,23,,1.0,12/28/2015,"This restaurant is by far the worst establishment I have ever been to. Was at the bar section with one friend last night 12.27.15 we were short $3 for the tab. Told my buddy to stay while I ran down the street to my house to get the change since I didn't have the change in my car unfortunately. The employee at the bar with the eyepatch was unprofessional and the most disrespectful employee I have ever came across. When I confronted him about his service when i returned he said and I quote ""screw you"". I said as i started walking away. ""I've never been so disrespect in my life"" what a joke, what a joke!!  They harassed my friend while i was gone telling him that i looked like that kind of person and telling my friend I seemed shady. Excuse me? Wow. Stating that my buddy needs to start washing dishes, I couldn't believe what was happening. Employees do need to take the necessary steps for a situation that may be a ticket walk out, but come on!!! Be respectful give the customer the benefit of the doubt do not ever come at a customer with foul language and disrespectful remarks. I came back payed the few bucks and will never return to this horrible establishment. The management was not helpful. The ""manager"" on duty that night was incompetent and should not have the title of a manager. I called him that night since he refused to speak with me at the time of the event and i was dumbfounded couldnt believe he was going to let an employee disrespect a customer that way. I've taken this to corporate because this is not a simple rude, Slow service, cold food type of issue. The employee turned it into a personal matter for unknown reasons to me and my friend, since neither of us knew either bar server or manager. Just unbelievable, unbelievable!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-weatherford-3?start=20
Heidi D.,"Plano, TX",12,31,2,1.0,10/31/2011,"Bad bad bad. Hard to get to, the food was bad--cold and flavorless, even for a chain restaurant--the table was sticky and the customers at the table next to us couldn't stop complaining about the fact that soccer was on the television, going so far as to ask the wait staff to ""Turn off that communist s***."" For awhile I decided to try to go to as many different places that the small town of Weatherford has to offer, but I've since decided it might be a better plan to just drive to Fort Worth. Or (egads!) cook at home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-weatherford-3?start=20
M L.,"Willow Park, TX",0,2,,1.0,8/17/2013,"I stopped in with a friend for lunch as we were passing through. The place reeked of cigarette smoke when we walked through the door. We were seated at a table, sat there for 10 minutes and our server never came by to get our drink orders. The restaurant was empty except for a couple seated next to us. We decided maybe we'd get service if we moved to the bar. We walked into a cloud of smoke when we enter the bar area. Needless to say we did not stay for lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-weatherford-3?start=20
JoyceAnn S.,"Abilene, TX",5,61,142,5.0,9/13/2017,"I would say that most of the time we go to the Metroplex, we stop at Applebee's in the way home. Today we intended to try another place.  But we left later than we wanted, and decided Applebee's is always worth going to.  Today was no exception! The greeter promptly walked out to help us with a big smile and nice attitude.  Led us to our table and took our drink order.  (Diet Pepsi if you must know. can't/don't drink alcohol.).  We had the 2 for $20.  (Plus 2.99 for an upgrade.) I wanted food on the 2 for $20 menu; he wanted the 8oz sirloin on the $25.  So that is what he got. We had 2side salads, I had the 3 Cheese Macaroni with Grilled Chicken.  Billy-the sirloin with broccoli and baked potato. Salads?  Delicious! The sirloin?  Was over cooked.  (He likes Medium Rare, it was Well done.) I (so sorry!) forgot to tell Sarah, our waitress, that I couldn't eat tomato  and had to send mine back.  So my husband sends his back. Actually, I just wanted mine redone, and my husband just wanted another steak.   What do they do?  Redo All of it!   The Manager brings it out, apologizes, and says ""we redo EVERYTHING here at Applebee's!  We want happy customers.""   This was AFTER my husband already ate his potato, and broccoli.  So he gets extra servings!  For no extra charge!  His eyes were as big as his appetite!  He loved it! I was even happier because my grilled Chicken, was grilled with more ""blackened "" pieces.  ( I love that flavor!!). Yes.  We were happy. Happy. Happy!  And our waitress? Sarah?  Wonderful!  Helpful! Friendly! Entertaining!  Hoping she will be there the next time we stop in.   If you go there, and you are lucky enough for Sarah to wait on you; give her a BIG tip!   Area Management, your Manager is great!  And your employees, pretty darn good people! ""We'll be back now.  Y'all hear?""   Good night! P.S.  I forgot taking photos!!  Again!  Too long of a day for my brain to continue functioning without food for so long.  Next time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-weatherford-3
Dustin S.,"Muskogee, OK",69,25,4,5.0,11/15/2017,Good service. Clean. Food was great. The 2 for $20 deal is the way to go. Beer was cold. Plenty of T.V.s. Lots of parking.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-weatherford-3
Perry A.,"Burleson, TX",0,8,,1.0,10/9/2017,This Applebee's is the worst one I've been to. Most locations have been good but this one needs new management.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-weatherford-3
Michael B.,"Weatherford, TX",0,1,,1.0,6/4/2017,We got there and got seated pretty quickly but with the first remake being oh there are no clean tables that literally only had three or four families in it kinda made me wary at the start we waited for 20 minutes to get drinks and then waited another 25 minutes with no one even checking on us. Truly the worst service I have ever had. We just got up and left didn't even say a word I shouldn't have to remind people how to do their jobs. We are now at McDonalds and got our food in a quarter of the time it took at Applebees.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-weatherford-3
Amy S.,"Cleburne, TX",2,11,8,2.0,5/6/2017,"The restaurant has a bad smell. We waited for a while to be sat at a table. Then after we were seated it took over 10 minutes for a server to come by to take our order. We were actually getting up to leave when someone came by to check on us. Kids liked their kids meals. My husband said the burger was ""OK."" I did not enjoy my steak quesadilla. The steak meat was tough. The condition of the bathrooms were gross, out of paper towels and soap.

Bonny K.,"Whitney, TX",19,4,,1.0,4/9/2017,"The latch on the handicapped stall was not only broken, but completely missing, which makes it hard for someone with disabilities like myself to use unless no privacy is something you want.  The service was really slow and pretty much with attitude, they acted like they were doing us a favor to wait on us.  When we first got there to an almost empty restaurant it took the hostess over 5 minutes to wander over. Then instead of seating us right away we had to hear about her medical issues.  Not a good place, don't even let me get started on the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-weatherford-3
Kaitlyn H.,"Daytona Beach, FL",30,1,,1.0,3/13/2017,"When your sitting a restaurant, the beginning words of every server in the restaurant shouldn't be ""I'm sorry, we have a new chef and are understaffed."" The adult beverage was very good, the food was lacking. My daughter ordered a burger well done, it came out raw, and I ordered a steak medium-well and it came out beef jerky. I asked for extra Parmesan sauce for my steak during our initial order. Asked for it 3 more times and finally received it after paying our bill and getting ready to walk out. The staff was severely undertrained and the restaurant was understaffed. Not to mention, our table was crumb-coated when we sat down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-weatherford-3
Pam L.,"Baton Rouge, LA",149,12,,5.0,5/19/2016,Not generally a fan of Applebee's - in fact have avoid this location for over a year - but while here on business finally broke down but happy to review . 1. Keep in mind it's an Applebee's so don't expect luxurious decor - think nice Shoney's at most 2. Super friendly service  3. Decent food for the price  4. ONLY SIT DOWN RESTAURANT IN WEATHERFORD WITH WIFI   May not be a big deal but when you're on the road sometimes is nice to relax/eat/work and this is the best.

Cody D.,"Weatherford, TX",0,27,1,1.0,6/18/2016,The food was worse than the service. It smelled like vomit and everyone there was more interested in playing than taking care of the customer.

Brittany B.,"Lacey, WA",7,46,5,1.0,11/24/2016,"The only reason I gave it a star is because it didn't give me an option to NOT give it one at all. We came here on thanksgiving. It took forever to get a drink order. The guy waiting on us was clueless. He had to come back to us and ask a million questions multiple times. Maybe he was new, maybe he wasn't, not really sure. The appetizer came out with our entrees when we specifically told him we wanted it before our meals. One of us didn't get the soup to our salads and they tried to charge us. He didn't know what salad dressings they had. There was a bar fight inside the bar... like seriously, I wish I was kidding. At Applebee's. A family restaurant. On thanksgiving day. The guys took their shirts off. And they didn't get kicked out, they let them stay. Yeah great idea, serve the idiots more alcohol. I'm certain that the only reason the place is in business is because of the bar regulars. We got a side of Mac n cheese... it was old as crap, out of a box Mac n cheese. We asked for plates for our appetizers and they were ALL dirty when they came, same with the silverware. It was disgusting. The water tasted like they got it out of the drain of dirty dishes. Seriously the worst place ever. The guy got a 10% tip only because it was thanksgiving. Had it not been thanksgiving he wouldn't have gotten crap out of me. He had to go ask if they did a military discount, I told him they did and he said they didn't, I said you best go ask your manager because I know ya'll do. Don't come here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-weatherford-3
Ematt M.,"Weatherford, TX",25,11,56,3.0,10/8/2015,"I just had the full rack of ribs. They were good and the meat fell off bone. I had it with Asian sauce to make it a little spicy. I had the choice to have it spicy mild or even a sweet sauce. Yea my tea was a little strong, but after the ice melted a little, it was better.

Crystal S.,"Weatherford, TX",21,15,,1.0,6/7/2016,"1 star is literally 1 star more than this location deserves. Absolutely the WORST service I have had in my life & not just once but every time. I really like Applebee's food so aftet a horrible experience we always end up going back after a couple months just for the same bad service. The last time I went we hadn't been in over a year & thought surely things would be better this time. Nope it was worse. We gave our orders to a friendly enough server who after taking orders never came back to offer refills or our appetizers. He finally came with food but my dish was completely different than what I ordered he said he would have it out for me & we canceled the appetizers. After waiting 35-45 more minutes without a word from anyone about my plate or to offer refills & the other 3 people at my table finish with their meals a girl came by & asked if we were doing ok. I told her actually no we're not & could she please find my server & send him over. She told me she couldn't find him anywhere & he was supposed to be training her, at this point I just felt sorry for this poor girl. So I asked to to get the manager since our waiter ""disappeared"" she came back after about another 7 minutes & said the manager said he was too busy to come speak to us but that she could just comp our meal. I looked around the empty restaurant & said to her so with 4 total tables counting mine your manager is too busy? She said sorry & again said my food was comped at this point I'm shocked & more then stunned & said your damn right It's comped I NEVER RECEIVED it. I then told her none of it was her fault & that if she was smart she would walk straight out the door & never look back just like I was going to do. This was new years day of this year & I will never forget it, I mean If it didn't happen to me personally I don't know if I would believe it really happened. I was there right over 2 hours total & never got food lol",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-weatherford-3

Yummy!!!   The crispy green beans were not healthy but crispy and hot.   We shared the Mac and cheese which we added broccoli to.  All warm although lacking a cheese jolt still pretty good.  Justin at the bar was engaging and the service was prompt.   The place needs some work.  But.  It was an afternoon out and the food was good and the conversation lively.   Of course I can't give it a 5 star because it had a slight smell and it seemed it needed a bit updating (the building) I will definitely eat there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-weatherford-3
