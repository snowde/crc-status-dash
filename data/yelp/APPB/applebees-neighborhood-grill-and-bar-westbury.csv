Cortney W.,"Brooklyn, NY",534,366,1044,4.0,1/5/2013,"My cousin and I went here after a 10 hour shopping mission in Roosevelt Field and I was pleasantly surprised. We only waited about 2 minutes for a table and we were promptly seated. The restaurant had the typical Applebee's decor.  Nothing special.  Basketball was on every screen.  We arrived just in time because right behind us was a rush of teenagers.   But let's get down to business here. The waitress was very attentive and quick. Definitely on top of her game.  We ordered a red apple sangria to share (buy 1, get 1) and 4 appetizers.  After 10 PM is half price!  That's right, half price!  We never see any need to set foot in an Applebee's before then.  So for the appetizers, the green beans were really good.  They came with a yummy dipping sauce.  They were crispy and hot.  We got the regular boneless buffalo wings.  Always a hit.  We also ordered mozzarella sticks and the beer battered pretzels which came with a cheesy sauce and spicy mustard. The pretzels were my least favorite.   The bill for the two of us came to about $25 which was fabulous. This is an okay location in my book.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-westbury?start=40
Lisa K.,"West Babylon, NY",0,3,,3.0,6/22/2016,This location is not bad. But the last time I visited I was very displeased with the bartender.

Luis P.,"Woodhaven, Queens, NY",150,7,1,5.0,5/5/2016,"It's very hard to believe that they're so many negative reviews at this location.  I had just got out of Cozymel's which is located 2 doors down pretty much in the same area. Being that it was Cinco DE Mayo "":Cozymel's were extremely overcrowded being that it is a Mexican food chain . I decided to check out the ""Applebee's "" which was also a little packed but not so bad . I was seated with my guests no more then 5 mins . The Hostess (Brittany) was one of the most Charmest & very professional girls , she was a total sweetheart . LISA was our server and she was just as amazing , very quick to take our order and very very attentive to us . Our drinks came out quicker then we thought and we're very outstanding.  Our starters came out quick as well as our entrees . Service was more then we expected it to be especially on Cinco DE Mayo . Our last drink for the night took a little longer being that it was getting more crowded . The Manager (Burch) came over quickly and apologized for taking long with the drinks . It was no biggy to us cause everything else nailed it. Manager comped us on the drinks which were ""Patron Margaritas "" Mucho size , and also comped us on Dessert . This was our first time at this Location.  I highly recommend this location and I will absolutely be returning again. Thanks , to a wonderful staff .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-westbury?start=40

Aside from the Long Island ones having a different menu then in queens, the food is totally different in portion. The people working are slow, all my servers I've ever had here were slow and forgot about me, and the portion of dipping sauce is crazy! I go for half off apps all the time and at this Applebee's they gave me just enough for half a pretzel mind you they give you 4. When I complained the server told me that's the portion. I highly doubt that. I'm pissed no manager came over but I did see him correcting a lot of people's late and wrong food.

Stan S.,"Island Park, NY",129,376,338,3.0,8/22/2013,"Typical Apple Bee's. So-so service. So-so food. 1/2 price appetizers -- specifically the quesadilla is always great on a late-night dinner/snack.

Megan M.,"Town of Hempstead, Long Island, NY",10,12,3,4.0,7/22/2015,"We stopped in for a quick dinner before our movie started at the theater down the block, little did I know we chose to go here on a night they were giving a free appetizer and dessert (July 21,2015) so the place was packed. When we were walking in one of the hostesses greeted us and held the door for us, we were sat immediately by the very friendly host. Our waiter (Ryan) was absolutely great. He was running all over the place trying to get everyone everything they needed. Our order came out 100% correct and he was quick to get us refills of our drinks. (I noticed he dealt with a table next to us very calmly, I wouldn't have been able to keep my cool like he did.) I ordered the quesadilla burger, very unique and delicious. My fiancé ordered the sweet Asian pineapple burger, he enjoyed his food as well. We noticed a little ad on the table for AMC movie tickets from them for $9 (you can buy one ticket with each adult entree purchased) it comes out to $2.50 cheaper than buying them at the theater, which worked out perfect because we were going to the movies after dinner.

Adrian C.,"East Meadow, NY",46,15,16,1.0,7/29/2015,"Great prices for average food and horrible horrible service. From the moment you walk in you are left waiting at an empty podium.. Left there as the ""servers"" screw around with each other, joking, laughing, talking doing everything BUT greeting guests at the door- we stood there long enough for me to watch most of the sports highlights on the tv. That being said we were finally sat at a table where... you guest it we waited and waited and waited for our server- once he came he began with his very well trained speech of specials and blah blah blah.... We asked for 2 waters with lemon and a few appetizers.  I eat in many places from lower end to very high end, I have been in/around the industry for many years- I am realistic and have real world expectations and I know this is ONLY an Applebee's BUT COME ON- a ridiculously long wait just to be seated?

Kathryn N.,"Glenolden, PA",35,42,4,2.0,2/20/2013,"While I have definitely had good and bad service at Applebee's before, this trip was pretty bad.  We were visiting my brother that goes to school in NY, and decided to go to Applebee's for lunch. Seemed like it would be a decent choice on a Monday afternoon. Not. While it was Presidents' day, and people were off, it should not have taken nearly as long as it did to get our food.   We got seated around 12:45 pm, and our food came out at about 2pm. Three out of the five of us got the soup and salad/entree lunch special. It's Applebee's, it's not like they are cooking the food fresh!  While we are assuming that our order was misplaced or something happened, because without having to be asked, the manager came to our table and comped the entire meal before the food FINALLY came out. While I applaud her handling of the situation, the waitstaff was barely ever seen, and they were pretty indifferent to the situation.  My favorite part of the whole ordeal was when the waitress was prompted with the question of the soup of the day, and she responded by reading all of the regular soup choices and chili.   I would suggest to not order the French onion soup, as it tasted pretty weird, and the Lemon Shrimp choice for the lunch was nothing to write home about. I will just stick with my usual after 9 trips to Applebee's for their Pomegranate Perfect Margarita and boneless wings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-westbury?start=40

Kristin H.,"East Rockaway, NY",0,3,,2.0,1/16/2016,"Went at approximately 11:30 pm, to partake in the half off appetizer and half off drinks deal. Our server did not come over after we sat down, so we ordered via the touch pad at the table, much to the waitresses' chagrin. Aside from ordering on the touchpad, we physically asked for refills which never happened, and every time we needed something, rather than the waitress checking on us we had to ""call her"" via the touchpad. When we finally got our refills the waitress threw down the straws in an aggressive manner. Every other restaurant I've been to, I've never had to use the touchpad because the waitstaff was attentive. Such was not the case last night. I will obviously come back to Applebees as a whole, but surely not the one in Westbury.

Derek M.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",384,156,255,3.0,3/28/2016,"I almost forgot about this Applebees because of their location being separate from the adjacent plaza of other restaurants. It was quite easy to find and I was able to find parking quite easily. Came here last night for dinner of 2 and we were told that the wait would be 20 mins to be seated. I found that strange because I saw that there were several seats at the bar open as well as five 2 people tables open. Regardless we sat down in the waiting room and looked at the menu. We were actually seated in about 10 minutes and were all ready to order by then. We went with the mozzarella sticks as an appetizer and got the 3-cheese Cavatappi and Bourbon street chicken & shrimp. The mozzarella sticks came out quite fast however their quality was not the best. The cheese inside the mozzarella was a bit chewy for my preference and was served at room temperature instead of hot. The bourbon street chicken and shrimp was also not the best. The chicken was tender a tid bit juicy, while the shrimp was lacking flavor for me. It also comes with a side of potatoes wedges on the side. Towards the end of our meal, we had to search for our waitress because we were in a crunch to catch a movie. However throughout the meal our waitress was not very present with us, we only saw her once in the beginning and once our food was delivered, but then nowhere to be found when we were done.  Overall - This isn't really the place I crave to eat because it's comparable to below average diner food and even their ""healthy"" selections are typically not fresh tasting. However it is a nice place to hang out with a group of people and share different appetizers and entrees with. I'd come here again with a group of people but not really on my own accord.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-westbury?start=20
A M.,"Smithtown, NY",47,11,3,1.0,6/21/2017,This Applebees is not the best place to go. Granted there have been several times that have been good it is really hit or miss as to the service and the food quality. Most recently I ordered an oriental chicken salad and it came out with chicken and those crunchy noodles and salad dressing but no lettuce!!! I told the others I was dining with to start eating and I would just get the waitress to replace it. Well they finished eating and we still waited before the waitress or anyone came over!! When I showed her the salad and asked her for the manager she gave me a snotty response. The manager apologized and offered to remake the salad however I told him the others had finished and I would just like the cost taken off the bill since it was not what I ordered. (I did eat chicken off it though). Anyway this is just one of the bad times we had.

The biggest thing I hate about corporate restaurants is the stupid upsell. I don't mean the, ""do you want to add a soup."" I mean the, ""hi, welcome to Applebee's, can I start you off with an Oreo shake or a beer."" It sounds so forced and demeaning. As if they don't have enough junk to fill up the table when you sit down, now they are forcing their servers to repeat what is already flashed in your face. This includes an obvious threat to the staff. I'm sure they wouldn't get in trouble if this happened. Right. Not to mention all the people in the world who don't care about other people and lie. The food was good. The server was nice, but the people who work in corporate are so out of touch with what the people who don't own restaurants really want.

Standard Applebee's, plenty of parking. Always presentable, nice and clean. Service is great most of the time, every now and then you get the lazy ""I don't want to be at work"" type waiter/waitress. We have waited a while for our food here. Sometimes the manager comes over to ask how our dinner was, that's very nice of you sir! Food: lets start with the apps, as most of us do. My fave classic app are the boneless bbq wings....bbq sauce on these bite sides pieces of white meat chicken is super good! New fave app, grilled chicken wonton tacos, chicken taco in a wonton shell topped with slaw and cilantro....yummalious! These are my faves, but they have lots of yummy stuff like spinach and artichoke dip, potato twisters, and steak quesadillas towers. Moving on to dinner, always good, I usually get the fiesta lime chicken, tangy chicken served with tortilla strips, pico de gallo, and rice, so fresh, so flavorful, so good! I also like the zesty roma chicken and shrimp and the napa chicken and portabellas, both are really good! My honey will get steak or a burger from them and he is never disappointed.  Dessert: 3 words for you....Triple Chocolate Meltdown, chocolate caked with fudge in the center, topped with hot fudge and a side of vanilla ice cream....back away folks...this could be dangerous!!!  I love that applebee's has a weight watchers menu and a under 550 calories menu, think that's a really cool option.  Price is reasonable, they have 2 for $20 menu that is great!!

It was downhill from there. I made the mistake of ordering the riblet platter, which was just shy of inedible. I substituted onion rings for fries and was disappointed with them. They looked and tasted like frozen. The riblets were not good. They were tiny little pieces of bone with the odd scrap of tasteless meat clinging every now and then. They were drowning in BBQ sauce, which I am still burping at bedtime. I ordered a simple coke to go with the meal and it was so bad I had to send it back. Our server, Quinson, explained that there was some problem with the soda fountain and the syrup but it almost wasn't drinkable.

As for the food they still make my favorite: the chicken oriental salad which has a great variety of textures and a good crunch while still being sweet yet savory. Other favorites are the fiesta salad and the bourbon street steak.

Asked 2 waiters what kind of meat we were eating but they were clueless...fries were white and fairly uncooked...thai chili sauce was overpowering, honey mustard sauce lackluster.

We are told by waiter after waiter that we can't do this after we had already spoken to the manager, explained our position that we are asking for a substitution that will save the company money yet achieive our dietary objective, and then got it cleared from the manager. (supposedly for all future visits). Tonight was no different. The waitress gave us the stock lines usually given and went back to check if this was ok and again got it approved. Then we placed a drink order. She returned with our drinks and then we didn't see her for a good while. When she finally returned, she took our order for dinner.   One of the staff members brought our our appetizer and we asked the waitress that brought the appetizers if we could have another drink (the drink ordered did not match what we asked for). My wife saw her tell our original waitress about our drink order and walk away. A good long time later (we had finished our meal), we finally got a drink from our original waitress which was AGAIN WRONG! It seems the staff is not well managed at this Applebee's. We overheard (and it wasn't hard) very inappropriate conversations being had by employees with customers right there. They were so focused on their conversations that service was not being given.

We usually give a good tip to our server, however this young lady was so inattentive that we decided to leave $1.00 and a note regarding her terrible service. I think this will be my last visit to Applebee's. I will know for sure after I write a letter to the Corporate Office. Avoid this one folks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-westbury?start=60
