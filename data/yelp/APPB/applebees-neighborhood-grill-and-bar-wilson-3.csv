Charlie F.,"Raleigh, NC",215,981,1222,3.0,10/14/2016,"Our work group went here on a Thursday night.  We were promptly seated, and the server quickly took our orders. I ordered the Smokin' Double Steak & Egg (Two hand-cut 4 oz. USDA Choice top sirloins, fried egg, stout gravy, bacon jam - description from their website) from their ""Chef's selection menu, and requested it be cooked medium. The two sirloins were not cooked the same.  One was indeed medium, and the other was tough and medium well to well.  Sides of mac n cheese and Crispy Cheddar Bacon Potatoes were good. Overall an average experience - not fantastic, not terrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wilson-3
Michelle P.,"Wilson, NC",0,4,,2.0,9/10/2017,My husband had a terrible experience. We will not be returning to this Applebees in the near future.  the manager was really nice and help,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wilson-3
Stacey W.,"Manchester, NH",2,14,4,2.0,6/10/2016,"Don't do it, don't ignore the reviews as I did. Overall experience terrible from the food to the staff. Manager I will say was good trying to do something but my entire experience was terrible. I travel for work and Applebee's one of the places I go to all the time. But this night I had a terrible experience the take out. When I got there to pick up my order it was not right. I had ordered the shrimp and parm sirloin and ended up with a petite sirloin, the wrong steak instead of redoing the whole thing they redid the steak. All I know is the rest of my meal was stone cold and terrible in my steak was close to raw, I ordered medium.  I think their servers need to be trained better to be more professional. I have worked in the restaurants in my younger years when you mess up in order to replace the whole thing not just the part that you messed up unless it can be done immediately. My order wasn't even close to being what I had ordered. I went back and doublecheck to make sure I didn't make a mistake, I did not make a mistake. I will never go to Applebee's again because of this experience. Take it from me go to Ruby Tuesday's whole different experience. I saw the bad reviews and like you I thought this is a franchise there's no way it could be that bad, it is that bad. I hate to leave bad reviews but I think I'm doing a disservice to others when I don't. Besides I think restaurants get their best info from the critiquing of customers, it helps improve service ect..,",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wilson-3
Terrell W.,"Greenville, NC",0,1,,5.0,10/20/2016,Had a great meal. Ordered the pork chop with crispy potatoes and sweet potato fries. Added some Hinez 57. It was a fantastic meal. The waiter was very attentive to our drinks. Which was water and tea,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wilson-3
Susan M.,"Tooele, UT",30,39,1,1.0,3/16/2016,"Strike 3 and yourrrrrrrr out! This particular Applebee's  has always had issues in the past and yesterday's service has proven my hypothesis through and through. This store is the worse excuse for a restaurant in Wilson, NC. Me and my husband ordered the 2 for $20.00 menu. The salads were awesome, I won't lie about it. They were fresh, crisp and delicious. I ordered the quasidilla burger and my husband ordered the Bourbon St. chicken meal. His food came out yummilicious, but mine, not so great. I ordered my burger plain. Meat, cheese, and bacon. When it got to the table it was covered in the mexi ranch sauce, so I asked the waiter to take it back and bring me another one. He assured me he would get me another one as quick as he could. When the burger came out, after 10 minutes and my husband was finished eating, it was burned to a crisp. Black as tar. I could not eat it, and I had to be at school so I did not have time to order something different. I was a little offset by this, and then I found out that the waiter himself had cooked the hamburger! What?? ""I wanted to make sure it was right for you"", ahhh how sweet. No. The manager did the right thing and did not charge us for any of our meal, but I can let you know that I will never go back to this Applebee's and I would recommend that you don't either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wilson-3
Rj B.,"Dalton, GA",125,521,456,2.0,4/14/2015,"Bad food, bad service.... Try somewhere else, you'll thank me later. Our highlight was leaving the place after we ate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wilson-3
Sally M.,"Greenville, NC",0,14,,1.0,11/5/2015,Horrible! !!! Our waiter jordan...was rude and more concerned with twerkin to drake hotlin bling than serving us lunch. We waited over an hour for some wings and 1 burger. Jordan offered no solution to my friends complaint about lack of bacon on her Bacon burger. He was rude and incompetent. Worst part the lazy manager knew what happened and did not even come over. She was too busy watching other employees shake their @$$. This place is ratchet and customer service is nonexistent at least from 12 to 2 when we went.  FYI is was dead in there maybe 12 tables why did it take an hour!?!?!?!?!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wilson-3
Terri M.,"Wilson, NC",2,15,,2.0,7/4/2013,"Unfortunately, this Applebee's needs some help.  We've been in the past and had the expected experience for this type of business OK food. OK service. But recently, it has gone downhill. When we went for dinner tonight, it was not very busy.  That appears to mean that the servers can have their own little party. They had set up a table in tha. Bar area and seemed to be having a very good time. Normally, this would not bother me. It was a slow night so why not? As long as you are taking care of business. But there's the problem. My family and the other customers appear to have interrupted the party with our business. Our waitress was nice enough but very slow to ate our orders and very anxious to get back to her friends.  My drink was watered down and topped with a half glass of whipped cream. Steak was overdone.  The staff definitely need some guidance",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wilson-3
Franceli B.,"Wilson, NC",0,5,,4.0,7/3/2015,Service has always been good every time we have gone there. Wait time is around 15 minutes. Good food and ok prices. It's nothing special but not bad. I like eating here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wilson-3
Lynn A.,"Washington, DC",2,21,3,1.0,9/4/2015,"Apparently NC is the place where good and great restaurants go to die and this isn't different. Ordered one of the ""new'  smash burger. The burger arrived and looked nothing like the menu. I sent it back and the backwater manager had the audacity to act like I should just accept whatever crap comes out of their kitchen from the less than accomplished cook-- no chance!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wilson-3
Brian Z.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",2,7,,1.0,8/31/2014,"This is probably the worst applebees I've ever seen. I don't ask for much, just a cheap meal. However, the wait staff are so slow. It took 10 minutes just to be seated and another 10 to get drinks. They spend most of their time consulting one another on who is doing what. Food was same applebees quality.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wilson-3
Leslie M.,"Goldsboro, NC",0,14,8,5.0,8/8/2015,"Been here a few times before today and it was always terrible. Customer service was not good, the place had duck taped booths and food wasn't that great. Walked in today and had a different experience! Customer service was wonderful, the place had been remodeled, and food was so good! New menus! Love it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wilson-3
Regina W.,"Lucama, NC",12,35,28,2.0,9/18/2013,I love Applebee's but not this location. I have given this place many chances but nothing ever seems to change really. The food is acceptable but the majority of the wait staff suck at their jobs. They hardly ever get the orders correct. I also hate receiving a glass or utensils that have remnants of left over food or lipstick on them.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wilson-3
Alex K.,"Center Valley, PA",34,17,5,2.0,8/4/2012,"Staff is friendly. This particular location is in desperate need of renovation. I have been to numerous Applebee's up North that have received the new redesign, and this place just feels dirty and decrepit.  The music is playing WAY to loud, to the point that the speakers are experiencing distortion, it's very aggravating to the ears. Applebee's seriously needs to renovate this place, it's just bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wilson-3

Awake W.,"Wilson, NC",1,45,,1.0,6/6/2012,"Applebees ....heard the menu had changed recently and for the better, so decided to have a dinner -  the place was not really busy - service was nice but super slow as the staff seemed to be having a staff party - someone walked in with a baby and the waitress decided to carry the baby around the restaurant - I support family time but do not want baby diaper on my waitress's hands  - everyone working at Applebees appeared like they wanted to leave - after a long time of watching the baby tour i just walked out and left the glass of stale tea on the table and the bad Musak.

James T.,"Alexandria, VA",22,35,6,1.0,5/9/2009,"I don't really ask for much from a chain restaurant like Applebee's.  It's not fine dining, it doesn't try to be, and I'm okay with that.  But somewhere, you just have to draw a line, and this particular Applebee's crossed that line. I went there for lunch a few weeks ago and ordered a quesadilla off of the healthy choice menu.  In retrospect, I probably should have noticed that virtually everyone else in the restaurant was eating something fried and gone with a more popular pick.  But I figured 'how badly can they possibly mess up a quesadilla?' Well, the answer is 'surprisingly badly.'  The trick to making a really terrible quesadilla is apparently letting the vegetables in it (this being the 'healthy' quesadilla, it had some sort of vegetables in it, mostly carrots) go spectacularly bad, just barely warming the thing up, then slathering it with sauce in order to disguise the bad veggies until the unsuspecting recipient is a few bites in.   My suspicion, admittedly unproven, is that the quesadilla had been made up in advance -- waaaay in advance -- improperly stored, and just dropped into a skillet and reheated when I ordered it. But that's really not the best part: when I pointed out, politely, to the waitress that they had just served me bad food, there wasn't any attempt made to do anything about it.  No offer to make another one (not that I would have taken them up on it), nor to take it off the check.  She just picked up the plate and wandered off, bringing me the check with the entree still on it a few minutes later.  That pretty much sealed the deal. Although I suspect you'd probably be safe eating there if you stuck to eating nothing but fried foods, you won't catch me there, ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wilson-3
