Mariam W.,"Dumfries, VA",51,58,18,1.0,5/29/2015,"Went there today for lunch. Short review: This place sucks, don't waste your money. Bad service, worse food. Go to Chilli's, it's only a mile down.  In-depth: Went in for a weekday lunch with the sister. Ordered a prime rib steak, wonton tacos, sriracha shrimp, and a plate of fries. The best item was the lowest in cost, the fries. Also...no endless fries like it's advertised on television. Anyways, the steak was OK. There was a considerable amount of fat on it, but it was cooked medium rare like I asked, with a tad bit too much seasoning but definitely edible. Now, I'd even say that it was delicious (because really I am not hard to please!) if the lentils, barley, and spinach hadn't been so terrible. It was seasonless with so much excess liquid...like gruel or slop even. I hated it, didn't even finish it.  The sister had srirache shrimp, which she loved. I tasted them and they were nice, like any good bang bang shrimp you'd have. Wonton tacos were atrocious. Coleslaw was watery and tasted off, chicken tasted like it'd been reheated, and the tacos were sad. Just an off...middle school cafeteria type of taste. Fries were on point! I'd give this place 2 stars had it not been for the horrible service. Waitress asked if we wanted our drinks refilled, came by literally 20 minutes later after we'd finished our meal. Incidentally, she was very quick in getting our bill and tip as we left. There was literally 2 parties in the entire restaurant, attention to detail please!! Horrible, horrible experience. I'm off Applebee's as a chain, but specifically this horrible franchise in Woodbridge, Virginia.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woodbridge?start=20
Meggan M.,"Woodbridge, VA",47,48,78,2.0,7/1/2015,"I am upping the stars for customer service response.  I received a call from the GM, Heather, at this location.  She explained that the day we dined was unusual because the management team was off-site for meetings, etc ...  She is sending me a gift card.  I told her that I appreciated her professionalism and courtesy and that my family and I will give it another shot. 8-3-15 I am taking the stars back down.  I never received a gift certificate from the GM as promised, so I won't be going back.  If you're going to correct a problem, then do it.    They lost my business now and I can spend my money at so many other worthy places.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woodbridge?start=20
Luce D.,"Quail Valley, CA",8,27,1,2.0,1/5/2016,"Im only providing the facts, so people can understand the situation. My rating is for the entire experience, including service, food, and appearance. It was New Years Day, around 6pm. My wife, son, and I entered. The restaurant was not busy at all, probably less than 50% full. A young [black] male waiter said ""hold on a minute"" and left. I kept an eye on him and he was hanging out by the back of the bar area. We waited 3-4 minutes in front, until another young [black] male passed us asking us if we've been helped. I said I don't think so? He was very respectful and sat us near the back of the restaurant where the first [black] male waiter was ""working."" We were seated for about 15 minutes, passed by 2 other young waiters [white male, hispanic female] without being acknowledged. The area around us was dirty with food and trash on the ground and crumbs on the tables. The seats were broken or torn. Everything was just an eye soar... Another family was seated directly diagonally to us and were acknowledged and serviced with drinks and orders taken by the hispanic female waitress. The 1st [black] waiter was in the back near us texting, pretending to work. He literally looked like he was waiting to clock out and looked miserable. At this point, we got up and left. I asked to speak to the manager. A older [hispanic] female manager spoke with me and asked what happened. I explained the situation, without using race to identify the waiters. She herself asked me if it was the young black waiter, with a kind of disappointment in her voice? I said it didn't matter, that no one acknowledged us. She asked us to stay stating she would take care of us. We agreed to stay. We were seated in a different [cleaner] area with an older [white] waitress, and actually provided with good service. The food was decent, not anything special.  Why I add the race of the waiters and waitresses in this review? Because I want people to know exactly what I experienced and with who... I am a dark skinned hispanic (California native] new to NoVA, and too me, the youth in this area are lazy, especially the young black youth. I never experienced such laziness and disrespect by anyone until I came here, and unfortunately, Im experiencing it with young blacks and hispanics in this area, both male and female. For lack of better words, it is disappointing and it sucks! I will not be returning to this restaurant. I hope my experiences around here change and wish no one else has these types of experiences.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woodbridge?start=20

Jack D.,"Dumfries, VA",385,31,3,1.0,10/5/2014,"This was definitely my worst dining experience I have gotten from any restaurant.  Buddy of mine and I came in for the all you can crosscut ribs that I've been hearing about; and we never even got a chancd to taste them. We got sat at a booth by friendly hostess, then waited for 10 minutes without beinh greeted before we got angry and walked out.  If they were packed and busy, I wouldn't even be upset and understand; but all the servers were standing around not doing a damn thing!  We even overheard a server complaining about how he doesn't have anything to do! Overall, taking over 10 minutes to even just acknowledge your customers or taking a drink order on an empty football Sunday around noon is unacceptable",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woodbridge?start=20
Megan H.,"Woodbridge, VA",27,1,,1.0,8/7/2015,"Placed a curbside to go order today. Apparently, the item I want is no longer made at this location and instead of calling me to change it before I got there, they just replaced it with another roll up and gave me the sauce that came with the item I wanted originally. So I have a fajita Rollup with oriental dressing now. I didn't realize that was what I had until I was already home also.

Anna V.,"Herndon, VA",0,1,,1.0,3/28/2016,"So... I usually go to the Centreville location (which is amazing!) but my family stopped by this one after we went to Potomac Mills. First off, It was a Saturday so we figured there were no happy hour specials, but we thought we'd ask anyways. To our surprise, our waiter said beer on tap was $3.50! So my husband and I ordered 2 beers. When we got our check, I saw that we were charged full price, which was $7 a glass.... Of course I said something to our waiter. A different lady came back and said that happy hour ended at 6 and I told her we got there at 5:30. She tried to ARGUE with me saying we ordered after 6 and said she would check the time sheet? Whatever that meant. After she left, another guy came up and apologized to us saying there's no specials on the weekends.... at this point I was irritated. He offered coupons, and said he can't take off the charges? I denied the coupons and he took 20% off my bill. Let's just say I never going back to this location :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woodbridge?start=20
Gautam S.,"Dale City, VA",0,22,,1.0,4/3/2015,"Ugh complete utter trash food.  I'm not picky but the portions were small for the amount of money they charge.  No seasoning at all.  I had some potatoes in my chicken/shrimp dish and they treated like cardboard.  The""blackened"" shrimp tasted like they had been microwaved. The chicken was a little dry.  The onions had a strange smell in them Kids Mac n cheese was literally the same box you get for 80 centre at the grocery store.  Mashed potatoes were instant potatoes.   The only good thing was the cake dessert.  Oh and the service was atrocious. Empty drink glasses and waiters ignoring me and the wife while were trying to flag them down.  And the piece of trash food/experience cost me $60. Never ever again",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woodbridge?start=20
Anne M.,"Woodbridge, VA",25,75,46,3.0,3/19/2015,"Okay, so time to update again... as of now, we'll go from a two to a three star-  Yelpers, know businesses read our reviews. Unfortunately not all of them are able to take in what they read and use it to better their business/service; some tend to take it personal as opposed to taking it for what it is... one person's perspective. And when you have many perspectives that are similar, then maybe it's time to consider what your consumers are telling you. Tonight I found out that I apparently have been labeled a difficult customer who is ""always writing bad reviews on Yelp"" - LOL  especially since this particular opinion has been formed from one particular person who has only ever spoken to me ONCE in the six or seven years I have been going there and, there is only ONE bad Yelp review on here for this Applebees.  Don't want a bad review, don't give me a reason to write one.  Apparently the last time I was in, she was like, ""Oh no... who should we give her to? Who can handle her best?""  Which cracks me up because if you knew me at all, after the SEVERAL years of loyal patronage, you would know that I am probably the LEAST difficult costumer you will ever have. Moreover, what you don't know when you don't know me, is that I have MASS respect for the hospitality profession and servers therein. I know it is one of the hardest professions to have. You are underpaid, overworked, and often have to deal with crazy mad people. Therefore, when you treat me well, I treat you well, and when you mess up, I call you out. When I get great service, you get great reviews and, I take 'care' of you. My last review was based on changes I witnessed over the years and how they have affected not only staff that I have come to know and love dearly, but, the atmosphere itself. Moreover, it is so palpable if you are a regular there as one of my friends pointed out a couple months ago when she came in to town.  After not having been there in a couple years, we went back for old times sake and she mentioned how different it felt... I won't even describe the horrible service we had that day because they apparently don't like such things to be revealed. Needless to say I filled her in on all the changes over the years and talked about how disappointing it was.  As I described to her all the changes and things that I had witnessed, and didn't like, a manager was sent over to confront, and I am sure silence me... I was asked for my opinions; my opinions were provided; yet with every opinion, the manager only tried to counter them in a very condescending way. Note: you don't counter opinions; everyone is entitled to them. But it wasn't really that I was being confronted more so than the way I was confronted... the manner in which this exchange took place was quite condescending and I could read every aspect of body language and micro expression of this person and knew she was far from concerned; more like pissed and wanting 'to show me and put me in my place.""  Nevertheless, I played nice but because of my forthright nature, have been labeled as difficult and it has been superimposed on me that I hate this person (whom I don't even know). So my last review was in November of 2014 wasn't very flattering... I was absolutely crushed by what was happening... for the record, my reviews here are based not only on my experiences over the past SIX OR SEVEN YEARS but, on what I see going on around me... If you read my reviews, you will see I do in fact tell it like it is. So if you fear my reviews, you must fear honesty (quite sad actually).  If you don't want a bad review, don't give me anything bad to write about and if you do, then accept it at face value, consider details and act accordingly and as appropriate, if appropriate. All aside and moving on, recently they got some new menu items so I started going back more frequently and although the LITs were no longer good, Jessica and Liz introduced me to Mango LITs with OSS Mango and Sprite instead of Pepsi! Genius! and Executed perfectly by Yitka the bartender. So that has become my new favorite. The Siracha Shrimp is fabulous! Meatball appetizer is really good too served with a fresh piece of warm french bread!  Unfortunately, they still can't cook a good steak to save their lives sadly but there are plenty of other things on the menu I suppose. The burgers are good and the fries with BBQ spice.. oh yea... and don't get me started on the Fiesta Chopped Chicken Salad! OMGOSH SO GOOD. Although my old crew has moved on, a new one has slowly been developing and I am going back more and more.  Jessica is fabulous and it is because of her that I started going back more. Kim, one of the managers there is a great manager and person; she was a server but has earned her way up the ranks; very happy for her. Julia is perhaps the most precious thing in the whole organization; she runs the To Go operation there on shift and is wonderful. And then of course, my Lizzy and Philip will always be my boos.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woodbridge?start=20
Linda D.,"Woodbridge, VA",1,25,,5.0,5/27/2015,"I had a classic burger with all the fixing, asked the waitress if they could make it just like the advertised picture and she said ok. Well, the burger came out and not only did it look just like the advertised picture it was so delicious. Maybe the best burger I have had in a long time. I mean the burger was excellent, and it was so good I had to tell the manager what a wonderful job the chef did and the waitress for requesting what I wanted. My lunch was really good and filling. Service was great and I will come again. So, if you want a nice big burger go to Applebee's in Woodbridge, you will not be disappointed.

Alanna B.,"Manassas, VA",54,23,4,3.0,9/18/2015,"I'd give this place average rating because the food was served a little cold. The French onion soup definitely hard to get through because of the cold cheese on top instead of melting easily and being something enticing it was kind of like a science project gone wrong. Plate presentation was sloppy, back of house needs to step up. The service was good. Me and my family-three of us-came in about 45 minutes before closing.

Fogell M.,"Woodbridge, VA",1,14,32,3.0,2/18/2015,"First off this is an okay place to dine at, not too fancy nor not to cheap. They have pretty decent service and the staff here is polite for the most part. All the times that I've come here I never had to wait more than five or 10 minutes to be seated. They recently just changed all their drink menus and in my opinion they are not all that good so I just stick to the regular beers now or I may have a Mojito every now and then. All the time that I have ordered food I have always been satisfied with my order. So I would deathly recommend this place for anyone to dine at when they want a quick dinner eating out. They have plenty of TVs to watch sports they also have a nice bar area and regular blue seatings for families or groups. I dislike how it is usually always usually cold every time I come in.

Jim Z.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,2,,2.0,3/8/2014,"My family and I have frequented this Applebees a lot in the past. On a Saturday night there was never much wait and the food and service were good. Not tonight. I was surprised as we were being led to our table how dirty the carpet was. Doesn't look like it had been vacuumed in a week. We sat for a while before a waitress showed up. It wasn't that busy for the 15 minute wait.  The food was just OK. I had a blue cheese burger, my wife had the fried chicken salad and my daughter had the sun dried tomato chicken pasta. My burger was fine, but when I used the ketchup, it did not taste like Heinz. Either the ketchup went bad in the bottle or they're putting non-Heinz in there. My wife commented that the fried chicken salad has shrunk. Otherwise the food was about on par with what we would expect from Applebees. Service was horrible. It took forever to get a refill of water and a second beer. The second beer didn't arrive until I was finished eating. For some reason, our waitress was not on any part of the floor for long periods of time. Also, we had three different servers in our small area. For a full restaurant, they should have assigned servers to sections so they could be present more. A gentleman came in and sat in our section and wasn't approached by any staff for almost 20 minutes. He started a conversation with the table next to him and I overheard him say he was going to leave just when the server came to their table and THEY had to tell him to take care of the customer. SAD.  There must have been a turnover of staff and/or management because this isn't the same restaurant we used to enjoy stopping in for a decent meal. I won't be coming back here any time soon.  3 stars for the food- 1 star for the service/environment",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woodbridge?start=20

Lai S.,"Orange Park, FL",31,78,777,1.0,4/11/2015,"Terrible service! Our waiter was incredibly rude.. I ordered a virgin mango strawberry daiquiri and asked if they have whole milk.. She came out with a piña colada and a really dirty sticky bottle of 2 % milk. I asked her if the drink was the daiquiri she looked at me and looked at the drink and said yes (I figured maybe it's a new thing for daiquiris to look like piña coladas) tasted it of course it was a piña colada she continued to tell me it was a daiquiri like I was crazy. Finally she took the drink back and the 2% percent milk (apparently 2% is considered whole milk to her too) a man brought me a slushy that was supposed to be the strawberry mango daiquiri-- to my disappointment it was not. After waiting about 45 mins to get our food we decided to just walk out, we were tired of the rude service and we still had not received our food and there were barely any ppl there!!!! If it were possible I would give this place negative stars everything was terrible! THIS WAS THEE WORST experience I have EVER had. The manager and owner waved us down then asked why we left then gave us back the money we left on the table for the awful drinks we did not drink; we let them know everything there was terrible, she offered us 50% off our next dining there-- we will never be back, they did not sound the least bit sincere nor did they sound like they really cared.

Katrina S.,"Woodbridge, VA",9,161,88,2.0,10/4/2014,"I could have sworn a wrote a review here but here it goes again. The food here is usually pretty decent. That is why I gave 2 stars. I also gave only 2 stars, because the service here is in my top 3 for the worst customer service ever. My family and I usually order food from the car side to go. They only ever get our order right 15% of the time. They are also inconsistent with orders. What I mean by this is we are fans of the apple dessert with the cream cheese filling and ice cream and side of apples. The inconsistency here is that sometimes they include the apples, other times they do not. Sometimes they include caramel sauce, sometimes they do not. Sometimes the ice cream is ice cream, sometimes it's a warm cream soup. And if you are thinking ""well maybe it just melted by the time you got home."" I live 3 minutes away. It was most likely melted because they don't care enough to separate an Ice cream dish from a hot entree, and they most likely took the ice cream out before getting everything else ready. Speaking of this dessert, I am not sure of the specific name, but when I attempted to order it over the phone for the carside to go, I was met with ""I have no idea what you're talking about."" Not "" not sure but here let me look it up for you"" or ""I'll just ask another employee what that dessert is called."" She didn't bother to look it up so I never got it. This type of service is typical for this location. Maybe you are wondering ""how come you never go inside to eat then."" Well that's because I don't want to sit through the eleventeen hour wait for the exact same service.

A waiter finally stood up from the bar and showed us to our table. Our waiter did arrive promptly, and took our drink orders. He brought back a coffee, but the mug was dirty. After bringing the second cup to our table, he did not leave any cream. We started looking at the table, and noticed rice had not been cleaned off the table from the meal before. I walked into the men's room, and was hit by this foul odor. The toilets looked as if they had not been cleaned in days, and there was toilet paper and paper towels on the floor. We complained to the manager, and left promptly. I had patronized this establishment once before quite a few years ago.  I had ordered cajun ribs that were a special at the time, and the ribs came out without the cajun seasoning.  The bar tender told me that was last order, and the kitchen was closed.  He could do nothing about it.

Seems as if they have a gnat infestation. Every 5-7 seconds we had to fan our food and try to swat the gnats away. After about 15 minutes of doing so I explained the situation to my waiter. I guess he hadn't noticed the fanning/swatting; but he said that he'd get the manager. Not that i was looking for a discount but seeing as though he knew of the said infestation, he'd grant one. Lets just say that w not the case. Not only did my table complain, but so did the table in front of us. The manager simply stated that the restaurant had undergone a treatment. If the case is that the gnats are back maybe they should rope off the area. I gave one star because at least they have free internet (which is allowing me to submit this review).

Jason K.,"Henderson, NV",0,13,1,2.0,6/12/2012,"I went my here with my wife last Saturday night after a ball game. It was also graduation night for several local high schools. It was about 10:50 pm when we walked in, (they are open till 12am) and there was a line of people. We were told by the ""Host"" it would be about a 20 min wait and when we said okay, he changed the wait time to maybe 30-40 min. I seen that there was an NBA game on about to end and decided to wait, knowing it would clear out soon. It kind of felt to me he was trying to scare us off with his inflated wait time. A few min later we over heard him telling the big group ahead of us that IHOP was open 24 hours, and explaining how long the process of cleaning up when the tables leave is going to take; again trying to scare off guests.  We were seated like I thought after about 15 min and were seated right next to the hostess desk upfront. The host didn't realize we could hear him or just didn't care, but we listened as he took cell-phone calls and talked with other staff about how irritated he was (using profanity)  that people kept coming in. He was supposed to be able to leave at 11 if they weren't busy and this was ruining his night. We watched as he told new customers that walked in that they would have to wait 30-45 min; and there wasn't even a line. I counted at least 8 people the scared away.  I've never felt more unwelcome at a restaurant and will not go back here anywhere near closing time again.

Gr8vette G.,"Lake Ridge, VA",2,242,1817,4.0,11/22/2017,"Believe it or not, I'm going to be a hypocrite today!  I have always said ""Safe gets you no where!"", but Applebee's has just proved me wrong! I was a little unsure at first and all signs were pointing in the wrong direction. The outside looked ok, but the inside looked poorly kept. It had mismatching chairs and bumpy booths. The waiter was slightly unenthusiastic and not really personable. My favorite quote from him was ""Do you want the meat (from the burger) pink or brown in the middle?"". I cracked up. I guess that's another way to deviate from the traditional cooking question. The food came out and was pretty basic looking. It didn't look bad and it didn't look special. It looked safe. The boneless wings looked like Tyson Nuggets dunked in buffalo sauce and the chicken from my pasta looked like Tyson Chicken Tenders with a honey glaze. I was worried, but after eating it, the food was actually pretty good for basic food. It was filling, as well. I was surprised. No one in my group hated their meal. Even with the price in consideration, the food didn't deduct from the stars. Neither did the portions deduct from the stars. It was really the mismatched decor inside and my waiter experience. For what this Applebee's was offering on food, I don't think this chain could get any better. For this reason, if you want good, safe food or one of the best this chain has to offer, this Applebee's is your restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woodbridge
Andrew P.,"Woodbridge, VA",51,250,60,2.0,10/21/2017,"Not best Applebee's in the world. Probably not the worst. I imagine the situation would be much more dire if they turned the lights on full blast because the carpet is in desperate need of a refresh.   The service could have been better. It seemed to take a while after drinks were delivered to have my food order taken.  Even then, my soda water was left empty after one glass, and it took even longer to clear my table. On a positive note, the server did ask me how I was doing when she walked by.  I would not want to be out on the road after a night here. I l'd like to think people at the bar are responsible drinkers, but the clientele were having too good of a time.  Then again, it ""is"" a bar & grille.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woodbridge

Chandler W.,"Manassas, VA",20,4,,4.0,12/6/2017,"Excellent and timely service.  A few loud customers, but I won't hold that against Applebees. They have a juke box and plenty of TVs. There is signs of wear within the restaurant like the carpet and outdoor loud speaker, but overall a nice place.

Sal B.,"Woodbridge, VA",21,47,14,1.0,7/2/2017,"I have been a repeat customer of this particular Applebee's since it open.  My wife is allergic to most foods and in the past, the staff was very accommodating and would season the steak and the vegetables using only salt.   Today I took her there like I do once a month to give her a break in the kitchen.  THE SERVICE SUCK SWAMP WATER.  NEVER EVER I HAVE SEEN A SERVER SO INCOMPETENT.  First, I ordered a Diet Coke and a Sprite.  A normal server would have told the customer they don't serve Coke products, but Pepsi.  If she had said something, I would have change my drinks, since my wife doesn't tolerate Mountain Dew.   After the debacle with the drinks, I started placing the order.  I asked for my wife steak and vegetables with salt only.  The server immediately told me they don't do that.  That the steaks are pre-season and they cannot do it.  I asked pre-season?  She responded, yes, they put them on grill and then they sprinkle the seasoning on them.  reminded me of the day I went to McDonalds and order 1/2 a dozen chicken nuggets and the cashier told me they only sell 4, 6, or 12 pieces.  Instead of arguing with this lady, I look at my wife and she knew.  I asked for the check for the two drinks, and since she was taking so long, I used the table terminal they are testing to replace the servers, look at my bill, 5.92 for two sodas, I call that highway robbery, left $6.00 and left.  WE ARE NOT COMING BACK. I believe the problems there are due to INCOMPETENT Management, and a lack of caring.  All you have to do is read the reviews, not a single comment from the manager, and even there is mention on how poorly the manager treats the customers when they complain.

Lyric P.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,22,6,1.0,10/24/2017,So October is $1 Magarita month. The drinks were very watered down and honestly what do you expect for $1. The food wasn't good either but if you get there from 3p-7p it's 1/2 price . Overall I'm disappointed with the drinks and the food. Now my waiter Jarvis was amazing and well worth the tip. He was very informative and promoted the products well. Excellent customer service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woodbridge
Keisha L.,"Woodbridge, VA",79,142,608,1.0,12/30/2016,"Disappointed is an understatement.  The best thing about this experience was the waitress Amanda. She was very nice and attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. The food on the other hand was less than desirable.  The spinach and artichoke dip was the only thing that was good. Our Bourbon Street Steak was a mess. We asked for medium well and the steak was one level pass rare.  Our waitress apologized and advised the manager. The kitchen manager came over and was less than empathetic.  She apologized but you have to look hard for the sincerity of the apology. She offered to get us whatever we wanted even if it's to go. But with the lack luster apology, would you want anything else? So we said we would just take dessert, a triple chocolate melt down and an apple chimi, keep in mind both are supposed to be hot, not room temp or one step from ice cold.  The ice cream and the dessert should not be the same temperature.  So at this point, the restaurant manager comes over an apologizes and offers to remake the desserts and ensure that they are hot. However, the hints of a freshly smoked Virginia Slim lingered long after her departure. Needless to say, they were hot the second time around. Disappointed is almost a compliment. But the most epic part of all this is as we are walking out to leave, the restaurant manager is walking towards us, looks up and sees us and immediately does a 180 to proceed in the opposite direction.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woodbridge

Bil G.,"Dale City, VA",5,325,,1.0,3/29/2017,"We went to Applebee's because my wife had a gift card.  For starters I ordered the cherry-limeade drink.  I knew from past experience that it is a glass packed full of ice, the lime rind and very little drink and since it cost $3.00 I told them little ice and no rind in the glass.  It took them 20 minutes to make my drink and when I got it the drink was made the usual way.  I sent it back and had to wait another 20 minutes for my drink.  This time what they did was leave out any lime juice so I got essentially a cherry drink.  I didn't discover that fact until I started drinking.  Since I did not want to wait another 20 minutes for yet a third drink I just gave up.  My wife and I ordered our food and I ordered the French onion soup but told them no cheese and croutons on the side.  20 minutes later a guy shows up with the French onion soup covered with cheese.  I had to send that back,  So then another 20 minutes and the soup, made correctly, shows up.  At this point I asked to speak to the manager as my wife is starving.  Apparently they are holding up her order while they screw around with my soup.  The manager shows up, finally.  She very obviously does not want to be there.  I get about half way through telling her about the problems when she abruptly turns, runs off yelling over her shoulder ""I'll check on that""?   Then finally my wife gets her Fish & Chips and they bring my steak, ordered cooked medium rare.  Of course the steak was cooked medium well.  So I told them to recook it.  After another 30 minutes they brought out the steak cooked medium.  I went ahead and ate the steak but asked for the manager again.  She reluctantly appeared again but quickly found an excuse to disappear.  She never returned after that.   Just a horrible experience.  The receipt had a name at the bottom, district manager, who said he loved feed back.  I sent him an e-mail and he never replied.  So then I called Corporate and they took down my complaint and promised me a follow-up but I never heard anything more.  A very sorry company.  Unfortunately we have to go back yet one more time to burn up the last gift card but I told my wife, no more Applebees gift cards.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woodbridge
Katrina K.,"Gaithersburg, MD",63,10,20,3.0,9/7/2016,"Mediocre. Fruit tea tasted like alcohol (mixed in an unrinsed tumbler I presume), my soda tasted flavorless but I finished it and got another drink,  Table was sticky, Salad did not comeout with the others soups, Food took a while for such an empty restaurant, however our waitress was polite, friendly and did not seem to get frustrated with our many changes and requests. steak very fatty, pecan mashed sweet potatoes were good, salmon was okay, streak cooked alright, nothing spectacular. Blackberry lemonade quencher was apparently not good but the strawberry one was fine, One of us was not offered a refill and felt left out/ thirsty.

Sabrina P.,"Stafford, VA",7,28,,5.0,3/28/2017,"While the food wasn't all that fabulous, my server was the absolute best server in the world. It wasn't BAD, but it just wasn't anything to go crazy for. My servers name was Sabine. We came in really late and she was clearly the only server working at that time. She had THREE tables get sat at the same time, plus having additional 3-5 other tables. Me being one of the third table, triple seating her. We were taken care of, and she was helpful about the menu. Nothing took a long time and everything came out just how we asked! She had an awesome personality and I would definitely request her and ask for her the next time I come in. She made our experience a 10/10 even though the food wasn't great just because she was able to keep us completely satisfied. Thanks Sabine!

Shanique W.,"Woodbridge, VA",22,24,178,3.0,3/18/2016,So I usually go to the location in Falls Church ... it's amazing the difference. Somehow for this location - the prices go up but the portions decrease (don't let the pic fool you - I zoomed lol). There's significant difference with the taste of the food also. It was soooo uncomfortably cold - I was ready to go as soon as I sat down. Our server Ashley was good & gave good service ... only reason I'm giving 3 stars. I rarely complain when I dine out - I work in the restaurant industry so I'm very understanding but I think I'm over this location now.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woodbridge
Ron L.,"Woodbridge, VA",22,49,,4.0,1/27/2016,"Visited here Jan.25, 2016 after my 2 sons cleared snow from my car....Since i live right across the parkway from Applebee's, this was a convenient outing.... I ordered the shrimp hot bacon vinagrette spinach salad which was excellent....I ate this particular salad for the first time about a month ago and fell in love with it...The amount of shrimp provided was adequate for the size of the salad and I did not feel cheated regarding the amount....... The shrimp were cooked perfectly with a great seasoning on them...the spinach was fresh and crispy and the dressing which was excellent is one item i would love to master preparing....It had a small amount of bacon bits, and the vinagrette had the perfect mix of vinegar and sweetness without being oily or over salted, which is a complaint in many restaurants... My only complaint which is minor probably, but should not even be a problem, is the long wait for coffee.....Our weather has been cold for the past week and it would seem places like this or any other restaurant chain would have coffee already prepared....Each time after a few minutes wait, the wait staff has informed us that a fresh pot is brewing....Really!!!!! I appreciate a fresh cup of coffee but shouldn't have to wait a minimum of 15 minutes unless the place is extremely busy, which it wasn't time or my previous visit to an Applebee's....Oh well!!!!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woodbridge

The beer was good, several good choices on draft - always a a great sign. Daughter and granddaughter had chicken tenders and french fries and said they were good, with mozzarella sticks as an appetizer.  Nothing spectacular, but after many years, still serving good food, still good waiter, and good value for money.  Can't complain!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woodbridge

Good was actually pretty good and the kids food came out quickly and was devoured by hungry boys who said it was yummy! Sweet tea was not sweet at all though and once the food was out we didn't see our waitress again until she asked if we wanted the check and then we got refills. Food was actually really delicious. Kids grilled chicken and applesauce, southwestern steak salad was amazing and my sirloin meat and potatoes was good, would have liked it better if some of the pieces weren't so tough and chewy. I loved my husbands salad though. Overall I was pleasantly surprised by you tonight Applebee's! Thanks!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woodbridge
