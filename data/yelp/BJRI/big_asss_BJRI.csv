It looks clean and the wait, with the exception of weekend nights, has never been very long.  The menu is pretty big and covers most food categories. On our latest visit, we began with fried cheese curds and spinach stuffed mushrooms. Both were quite good. I especially liked that the mushrooms contained artichokes as well as spinach. The cheese curds were soft and squeaky and very tasty. The drink I ordered was the Blood Orange Pom Sangria. The orange slice served on it was not a blood orange but it was still very good. The neat thing about this drink was it contained Fireball Cinnamon Whiskey which I had never had before. It was sweet with a bit of cinnamony heat and cooling citrus. I recommend this as a drink to try.  I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken. It's light but flavorful and is served with cheesy mashed potatoes, broccoli and a Chardonnay lemon butter sauce. Also ordered was the Spicy Pig Tavern Cut Pizza. It's like a thin flatbread and very crisp. This one has ham, applewood smoked bacon, pineapple and jalapeÌ±o. The other dish ordered was the Southern Comfort chicken sandwich which has crisp fried chicken breast, applewood smoked bacon, sliced ham, alfredo sauce and a Dijon mayonnaise.  My extreme sweet tooth kind of demands dessert so I got the chocolate chunk cookie Pizookie, a sizable chocolate chunk cookie served in a round pan like a deep dish pizza and topped with vanilla bean ice cream. Very enjoyable! The meal was good and we never felt rushed. We left quite full and satisfied.  If you don't want much of a wait make sure to get there from 5-5:30 PM or at least before 6PM on weekends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land1,Victoria M.,"Houston, TX",887,556,4025,3,12/12/17,"Setup: family dinner The better: large portions, lots of options, good chain restaurant food, family friendly The lesser: as with many chain restaurants, the food is really heavy.

My dad always gets a chicken salad. Their chips and dip are a little disappointing, mainly because the chips are sometimes stale. But the deep dish pizzas are pretty solid. Crunch crust with a chewy, bready middle with plenty of toppings and Parmesan/chili flakes on the side. Can't go wrong with that.  If I was just eating their pazookies, it'd be 5/5. Those things are fresh and melt in your mouth. Chocolate chunk is your classic, but I really really love their monkey bread as well. It's AMAZING!!! Service: 4/5 Today we had a really awesome waiter, who I'm sorry I can't for the life of me remember his name. He was an older gentleman who calls himself the biggest clown in the restaurant, but he cracked jokes, made us feel welcome, and we loved him. Had a great experience! I don't think I've ever been disappointed with service. They're timely and attentive. Atmosphere: 4/5 It's clean, it feels a little classier than your typical dining experience with your darker ambience and wood furniture. There's a bar with sports on the tvs scattered around. A little something for everyone. Bathrooms: 3.5/5 Gendered communal bathrooms. Not dirty! Pretty standard, and they match the aesthetic of the restaurant. Price: 3/5 It depends what you get. I'll admit, a lot of their main dishes cost upwards of $12, which is a bit much for me. But like I said before, I always get the pizzas for sharing so I end up paying around $8-10 per meal. What's great is they always have a lot of deals going around (check their social media). Today we used a BOGO entree coupon from their Facebook as well as the Father's Day VIP card that gives 20% off every visit from when you pick it up on Father's Day to July 9.

My server was Alexsandra B (that's the name on the receipt, she never actually introduced herself).  Let me start by saying my friends and I attend this restaurant often. The location is convenient for all of us and the pizookie is usually what gets us in, and the food is usually good too.  We went to the restaurant to catch up with each other. Our server was friendly but every time we wanted another drink or an appetizer we had to flag her down. She would constantly go to the tables on both sides of our booth and we would try to catch her when she dashed by. We finally caught her again when we were ready to order our meal.  We must have waited close to 40 minutes for our food. Please keep in mind that it was after 10 on a Wednesday night, so the place wasn't packed at all but somehow we continued to wait. Not once did the server come over to check on us, ask if anyone wanted another drink, or to give us an update on our food.  Finally one of the guys from the kitchen brings out our food. It was cold. Not cool, but actually cold. My friend ordered a pizza, she had to wait another 5 minutes for Alexsandra to bring her a plate. When my friend got the plate and grabbed a slice there was no gooey cheese coming up, her pizza was also cold. When the guy brought the pizza he brought it out with the pan carrier (that's used when the pizza is sizzling hot so they don't get burned) he could have just used his hands. This pan wasn't even warm. It seemed like the food was just sitting there in the back. If it's late night, and I assume you want to go home, wouldn't you get this food to the table asap? That's clearly not there logic.  Once again the server never came to check on how we were. We were annoyed by that point and my friend flagged her down for boxes and a pizookie. She paced around for a while, I believe at one point sitting at a booth on her phone. We got the check and soon left.  Fast forward to this morning, I woke up with diarrhea and vomiting everywhere. Haha! Guess who got food poisoning!  I'm beyond disappointed with my experience last night. Next time we good out I'll be sure to suggest a different restaurant.

There are a few things I really enjoy about this restaurant: 1) the deep dish pizza, 2) the Pizookies (OMG salted caramel), and 3) the fairly interesting selection of house beers. All three of those things happen to be their signature items. As an added bonus, 4) the menu is about 500 pages long, so it's group friendly as far as selection goes. They offer a selection of perhaps 10 different beer types, so you can generally find something that pairs well with your meal. Get a flight to sample your favs. My husband loves to start with the avocado egg rolls, which are basically avocado bites fried in egg roll wrapping and served up with a dipping sauce. (Personally, I prefer the potato skins.) The deep dish pizzas are unlike others I've tried - they're less pie-like and more pillowy, which I adore. My favorite is the Pepperoni Extreme, which has sliced, diced, & julienned pepperonis. A small (6 slice) can definitely feed two people; order a medium (8 slice) and you'll be taking home leftovers. And fiiiiinally...the Pizookies. Usually I don't order dessert, much less a cookie, but this....this is different. The warm, gooey, caramelized-on-the-outside Pizookie is to die for. The salted caramel flavor is my absolute favorite, but the triple chocolate and white chocolate Macadamia come in close behind. You can get a free mini on your birthday, too! I've had other items, like the burger and the deep dish ravioli (which is more like a lasagna baked in a pie-like pan), and they're solid. But they'll not why I keep returning.

I've already become friendly with some of the servers since I've become more of a regular here.

I prefer to know how much my item is going to cost and not be blind sided when my check comes. I ordered the Tickled Pink because of how tasty it looked on the menu. When I received my drink it looked nothing like the picture! There was no garnish and the fruit that was supposed to be in the drink was left out. When I tasted the drink it was disgusting as well so I sent it back and ordered the Strawberry Splash. The description described it to be a frozen Pina colada like drink with strawberry purÌ©e. Again disappointment, while the appearance this time was much better the texture was a let down. There were chunks of huge pieces of ice throughout my drink as if it was not mixed well in the machine to have that smooth frozen drink consistency. Plus I could not taste any alcohol, definite waste of $9. Definitely not worth the money I payed. Onto the food, I ordered the BJ's brewhouse burger with thin cut fries.

Last time I was at BJ's, I ordered their bison burger, fries and cheese sauce, and a chocolate chip Pizookie for dessert. Their bison burger was good (though I must say i've had better bison burgers at actual burger restaurants, but that is to be expected). Their fries and cheese sauce was also a nice side to share. The cheese on the fries also had some spice added to it, which was a plus. My favorite part of my visits to BJ's is the dessert! I absolutely enjoy their Pizookie--which is a ""hot, out of the oven, rich and delicious, gluten-free cookie topped with åÊvanilla bean ice cream and served in its own deep dish."" It sounds simple, but it's truly an amazing way to end the meal. I like how there are several cookies you can choose from.

Why let a customer order an entire pint, only to find they dislike it, then have to pour an entire serving down the drain??? Good marketing strategy IMO.  We also tried the Black & Blue Brewhouse Burger & also some of the corn & bacon fritters. The fritters were killer!!! The aioli sauce they come with has the perfect amount of spice. The burger was ok...but then again I'd just not too long ago had that burger from Stanton's so I may be giving an unfair comparison åÊ:-) All in all I had a good experience at this location.

Maybe Lawrence wasn't in a good mood, because he would continuously walk past our table and give us a quick glimpse and did not say a word to us. My friend had to get the manager twice because we were not getting any assistance. Once the manger came to our table apologizing for her employee behavior.

Nope. I've come here about five times over the past few months and each time has been SO disappointing. Horrible service and long waits for EVERYTHING. I understand that they're one of the more popular places in the Sugar Land area (especially since it's so close to Town Center and the mall), but goodness...if you're gonna make your guests wait so long for a table, at least give them good service. Servers always take around 10 minutes to come greet you and take your drink order. After that, it takes another 10-15 minutes just to get your drink (I ordered a water each time). The last time I went, I ordered a strawberry mojito and it took 20 minutes to come. I get that the bar can be a bit hectic but keep in mind that this was a Tuesday night and the place wasn't that packed. Then, as soon as our server drops our drinks off, they're gone. GONE. I always have to flag down my server just so I can put in my food order. So beware - it will take you approximately 20-30 minutes before you can actually order your food. Then after we were done eating and ready to go, the server was nowhere to be found. After about 10 minutes, she showed up and we asked her to split it since we were all paying separately. All we ordered were 3 waters, 3 drinks from the bar, and 2 desserts...yet it took forever for her to bring the checks to us, forever to pick up our checks after we put our cards/money in there, and forever for her to bring it back for us to sign. I don't suggest coming here if you're looking for a quick meal AT ALL. Now the food...their pizookies are absolutely DELICIOUS. I've tried almost every one and have loved them all! Their appetizers and main dishes are all pretty tasty too! Don't get the fried beignet though, it's not that great.

Thai wontons and Thai lettuce wraps were the business. A nice sweet sauce with just the right amount of spice. The wraps had shrimp that was cooked quite nicely. The flatbread wasn't anything to brag about and I wouldn't get it again. I think it needed more sauce. So next time maybe I'll try a deep dish or traditional pizza.

The pizza is really good too although the deep dish isn't real deep dish pizza (I went to school in Chicago haha) And of course, they are known for their pizookie desserts which are cookies baked in pans and topped with ice cream and whipped cream.

It's a great place to have lunch with coworkers, catch up with friends, dinner with the family, etc. (yes family, even though it's a brewhouse too). åÊIt's open til midnight so you have a place to go when most other restaurants close at like 9-10pm.

Even the manager (I presume) consistently came up to tables and asked how everyone's visit/food is. I really appreciate that.  The variety of things they have on their menu, from drinks to food to desserts, is great. The first few pages of their menu is nothing but beer, and I think BJ's has their own beer for their restaurant. They have lighter options, gluten free items and vegetarian items too! It's like there's a little something for everyone here. There's so many things I wanna try out here, but must do with future visits. As of right now, I've had the ahi poke (tuna, green onions, and avocado w/ wonton chips), spinach stuffed mushrooms, and angus beef sliders as appetizers, and the california burger (has avocado, green chilies, and pepper jack cheese on it) and parmesan crusted chicken (comes w/ mashed potatoes and broccoli) as entrees. I haven't found anything I haven't liked yet! Must try the flatbread pizzas, gourmet mac&cheese, and avocado egg rolls. And for dessert, it's soooo good it has to have its own section in my review. As I'm sure others have already mentioned: GET THE PIZOOKIE! The cookie itself comes in different flavors such as chocolate chunk, oatmeal raisin, white chocolate macadamia nut, cookies&creme, and red velvet. Yes I said it. A red velvet cookie with ice cream on top. During my last visit, I decided I had to try one of those, but my friends all wanted a different flavor. So we agreed on ordering the pizookie trio, which is a sampler of your choice of 3 pizookies. We chose red velvet, white macadamia nut, and chocolate chunk. Each one was so good, my mind was blown.

Everywhere I looked, the staff was briskly going from table to table trying to compliment guests and get orders out. However, going to the wrong table with an order defeats that gesture! Could it be that they got the order wrong because he or she doesn't use a notepad?! åÊAt least in my instance it was because I receive an incorrect order not once, but TWICE! åÊ The first order omitted my åÊrequest to add Blackened Shrimp to my Angel Hair Toscana, which looked like baby food. Poorly presented on plate with globs of angel hair and a few pieces of tomato sprawled onto the plate with dashes of olive oil. Not appetizing at all. Although the server apologized for the omission, I learned from one of my friend's mamas that you don't eat ugly food--and that Toscana was U-G-L-Y it had no alibi to be eaten for the price, so I sent it back and downgraded my purchase to a simple BJ Burger åÊwith Bacon that my friend had ordered. Her burger looked decent and the steak fries she allowed my eat to keep my stomach from growling had a nice crispy golden crust that I appreciated, but åÊonce my plate arrived, I was not impressed. Once again, the presentation was off for me: the meat patty was sliding to one side with a pillow rather than a bed of lettuce peeking out from the side. Other veggies looked smooshed under the bun. At this point, I wished I had convinced my friend to go to Smashburger across the street versus this massacre of fine ingredients that were being ill presented on this particular evening. Despite the sub par impression of my plate, my stomach had other desires--and that was to eat, so I decided to keep the burger and taste it. Nonetheless, my server had neglected to write down my request for mustard and burger sauce on the side. I received the ""burger sauce"" which was simply a BJ version of Big Mac sauce that was an epic failure. Secondly, I received mayonnaise instead of mustard, which further delayed me from eating my burger. By the time we flagged down our server, my burger was not hot, but at this point, I didn't care to send another entree back. I dealt with it and decided that my tip would demonstrate my dissatisfaction. åÊ Really was town on giving my server a tip with so many errors. I parted with one dollar for a near $12 purchase since the change from my transaction was not given back to me. Although I am finicky, I do tip when I dine out because I sympathize with server wages, BUT crappy and inconsistent wait service should not automatically receive a tip.

Sadly, there was also a piece of CHICKEN that my VEGETARIAN friend found in her pasta.  -The mahi-mahi tasted like old, microwaved fish, and the bed of rice it came over was excessively greasy.

Since burgers seemed like the only thing they could get right, she got a vegetarian burger instead. She said it was much better than her pasta.

Thirty minutes go by, still no food and absolutely no attention from the waiter or management. Forty-five minutes go by, still no food and still no one came by to give an update on our order. We finally have to flag down the waiter, Emory, and he says he just spoke to the manager and our food should be on our way.  Finally after an hour, we get our food by the manager Stephen and I ask what happened to our order. He says he had no idea and barely found out of the situation. Really? I thought the waiter had informed him of the situation. So we flag down yet another manager, Rene, and ask him what happened to our order. He has no clue as well but said he would come back to let us know.  So we have our food but empty waters and no condiments. So I literally have to walk up to Rene who was standing at the hostess stand to make the request because everyone just stopped coming by our table.  So at this point we had our food an hour delayed, no attention from managers or the waiter, no explanation, no water, & no condiments. We were very agitated so I flagged Rene down to get an explanation. Remind you, he was supposed to come back with an explanation but he was too busy playing hostess instead of being a manager. He rather chose to ignore us like everyone else until we confronted him. He finally admits the the ticket was lost in the kitchen and that's why our food was so late coming out. I get it, mistakes happen but it's the way that they are handled that rectifies the situation. The fact that we were practically ignored is where the dissatisfaction in service came from. If they had come to our table 20 minutes after us not receiving our food and explained the situation, I would not be writing such a negative review right now.

I felt like I was basically eating boiled pasta with some veggies thrown in. I used up half a jar of chili flakes to add flavor to the pasta if that's any indication of how bad it was. My aunt asked for two chicken tacos without any lettuce and she literally got two soft tortillas with just the chicken.

While crowded, the decibel level must have been the lowest I have ever heard in a room full of drunk people. BJ's brews their own beer and makes their own sodas, so maybe it's something in the beverages that keep people calm and sedate. The decor is equally weird--industrial corrugated metal accents and booths upholstered with fabric from tapestry vests circa 1990. Hurts my brain! The night of our visit we waited over ten minutes to be given menus or a greeting, even though we were seated right by the hostess stand. The waitress kept mixing up who ordered what and all of the food was obviously frozen and reheated as it came out at all different intervals. I was near the kitchen and could hear the chorus of microwave beepers going off. It's like the food you get at TGI Friday's or Chili's--corporate, processed ""product"" that was likely driven there in an 18 wheeler. Like, you could buy it boxed up at the store and make it yourself at home.  The prices for everything are pretty outrageous for mediocre-at-best food. $11 for avocado egg rolls (bland--needed salt), $5 for four tiny squares of bruschetta that equaled one breadstick, bland but well-fried mozzarella sticks for $8, and stuffed mushrooms for $8 that were really small button mushroom caps. Kind of disappointing. Equally disappointing was the beer itself. One of my dining companions ordered a beer that tasted like it had sat in a metal tank for days.

BJ's deep dish is like a thick fluffy, white bread crust with some toppings layered over it. The crust lacked the bite and chew you'd expect pizza crusts from pretty much every other pizza place in the world to have. The toppings were pretty generic and lukewarm; edible but nothing special.

While there are certain items that fall off the mark, there are certainly others that exceed expectations. Overall, an enjoyable option for dining if one were to decide on a restaurant that serves all manners of American bar food. I have recently just started frequenting the BJ's chain so I cannot vouch for all the food options that they offer. They do, however, have some outstanding items on the menu. They also offer locally-made in-house soda (root beer and cream soda) along with varieties of craft beer. A word of caution though - the menu is quite large and expansive. You will feel a little overwhelmed if you are not craving anything in particular. Of the items I have tried, I was thoroughly impressed with the gourmet mac and cheese. The subtle adjustments that they have made with the cheese composition along with the addition of the right amount of bacon and bread crumbs is sublime. The Chicken Fried Steak is also noteworthy. It is properly executed with the right amount of breading and seasoning and the sawmill gravy that is paired with the steak has just the right amount of salt and pepper. The deep dish pizzas are also worthy of a try. They have the right balance of airiness and crunch and the quality of the toppings is excellent. The dough also has a distinct sweetness to it that generally lends well to the flavors and saltiness in the toppings. The burgers do leave something to åÊbe desired. They are good but nothing exceptional. I wish they were better. I do appreciate the option of choosing either wedge-cut and frenched fries as I prefer my fries a little thicker. The in-house root beer and cream sodas are also worth a try. If you are a fan of either and can afford the extra calories, be sure to give it a go. Refills are also included. One thing that I do have an issue with is the pricing of some menu items. More often than not, I find myself questioning the value of the food that I have ordered. While the restaurant certainly isn't exorbitantly priced, I feel that some items are a lot more expensive than they should be. I also find the service in this specific location a little lacking.

What I remember about pizookies is that they come out the perfect amount of soft and gooey and this combination with the cold scoop of ice cream on top made a delicious rendezvous in your mouth.

My friend and I literally had to shove our spoons into them at a 90 degree angle just to be able to dig a little big of cookie each attempt.

Seeing it pop up in other areas around Houston is awesome too. BJ's opened when I wasn't of drinking age yet so I never got to experience their special beers till a few years later, but I pretty much fell in love with their crispy chicken sandwich and their pizookies. So much so that it became a favorite place of mine to eat around Sugar Land. When I would come home from college on the weekends, I'd always suggest to eat here with the family.  When I saw that one had opened in San Antonio just by randomly driving by, to say I was excited is an understatement. Friends at the time had never heard of the place or ever eaten there, so my enthusiasm for the restaurant was unfounded to them. But they found my loud vocal declaration, ""I love BJ's,"" in the middle of parking lot of a small Mexican restaurant amusing, while I realized a few seconds too late what else that implied. Yes, there were on-lookers, but you know what? I'm not ashamed!  Anyways, like I said I love the food here. Finally when I was of age I got to try one of their hand-crafted beers. The name of it escapes me, since I normally don't go there to drink but it was fruity, kind of like a berry taste and I do remember that it was good. Back to the food, my favorite thing to order here and which is always default is the crispy chicken sandwich. The combination of their fried chicken strips or tenderloins, honey mustard and the cheese garlic bread roll is pretty much what perfection tastes like. So good! Their potato wedges are also some of my favorite potato wedges I've ever had in life and that's not a sarcastic exaggeration at all, I genuinely really love those fries! I also love their deep dish pizza. One of my good friends and I come here often whenever we meet up since ironically there is also a BJ's in The Woodlands where she lives and our go-to order is always a medium pepperoni and sausage deep dish pizza. It's so good and never mind the fact that we are ALWAYS starving before we go here, but it's even better that the pizza is one of the most delicious things ever. Other items I've had here are exceptional also, I don't recall ever ordering something that I didn't like or was disappointed over except maybe their special or hand-crafted sodas. Their ""cream"" soda doesn't even really taste like a dreamsicle, but more like orange fanta with a slight ""cream"" after taste.

I tried a couple bites of my dad's entree and it was very good, although it could have benefited from less of the sauce (lemon chardonnary butter sauce) on top. He was happy with his meal and called it ""delicious!"" Anyway, I wish my schedule were such that I could go back to BJs for lunch because I really want to get their chicken tenders + fries lunch special again... it was a while ago but I still remember the succulent, tender meat, lightly breaded just the way I like it. And it was only $5.99! Talk about a deal.  Oh, and as for service, our waiter was very nice. Only thing was it took a long time to get our check and then to get our card swiped, so there were some moments where we strained our necks looking around for our waiter... the restaurant was very busy... *shrug* Anyway back to the pizza.

Let me start off by saying that I like BJ's (no, get your mind out of the gutter!) and have had ample experience eating in other locations. When I lived in Las Vegas, I would frequent the BJ's on W. Charleston Blvd more than several times a year. For me, It was a post climbing ritual where you could relax in the a/c while carb loading on their tasty barley pops and delicious deep dish pizzas. I was always impressed with the food quality and service I received there. In fact, I would easily give that particular chain location a solid 3.5 - 4 stars. Not so, here. On a recent visit to Houston, we agreed to meet some old friends at this particular location for a late Sunday lunch. We ordered the avocado app, a side salad and the mini spinach artichoke pizza. Again, I had much experience with these items before - they were usually the staple of my post-outdoors excursions out west. My friends ordered a couple of sandwiches with steak fries. We also had a few brews to go along with the meal - I've tried all of their brews and they're pretty decent. For some reason today, I just wanted their Piranha Pale Ale. The beer didn't disappoint. What got to me?? First off, the app came and it looked like a disaster had happened on the plate. Presentation shouldn't be a big deal, I know...but it literally looked like they just slapped the cut up pieces of avocado egg rolls on the plate. First impressions sometimes count. While the app didn't taste bad, it wasn't as crispy or well fried as I'd had at the other BJ's. Personally, I think it was under-fried (the prepared eggroll skins just looked pale and white). åÊI've ordered this dish many times in LV and never had it look so...well, unappetizing. Next the salad. Sure it's just a salad...but it came all chopped up in little cubes (I mean the letuce!) which was weird. To top it off, it looked old - there were bits of red tinges on the little lettuce cubes. Not good. Finally, the pizza. I usually order this knowing that I'll get something decent. Granted, for this meal, it was by far the best dish we tasted. However, I've had better at the other location. It just came out kind of cold and the cheese wasn't near as gooey as I've had in the past. Okay, granted...this is a chain. But as far as food quality control is concerned, this has got to be one of the worst BJ's I've been to. So 2 stars for the food which is weighted heavily for me. Considering it being a sports bar-type chain, I think service and ambiance were fine - easily, 3 - 3.5 stars. Beers deserve a decent 3- 3.5 star rating as well. About the same quality as or slightly less than Gordon-Biersch if you like that stuff. However, for the price of the some of the menu items (avocado eggrolls at $10, the mini pizza at $10, etc...), this was a HUGELY lackluster meal and was the most expensive meal we had that weekend as well as the worst quality (food) meal we experienced. The final bill was ~$80 (no tip) for 2 sandwiches + fries, our pizza, side salad, avocado eggroll app, and 3 beers. I think, for now, I'll pass on this place when I visit home again - there are so many better Houston restos out there for the price. This experience definitely showed me that all chain locations are not created equal. If you do crave this kind of food, I'd rather spend it on chains like Cheesecake factory which seem to offer up better QC on their food (across the nation).

That was where the pleasant dining experience ended. As a party of six, we expected that service would be slow, but what we experienced was ridiculous. After ordering our drinks, it took a long time for the server to bring out our two non-alcoholic drinks, and an even longer time for the alcoholic ones. He then took our order for our appetizer of mozzarella sticks, but left without asking whether we were ready to place our food order as well. He returned again, terse as before, barely muttering a word. While initially we assumed he was simply not talkative, we later noticed him animatedly chatting and explaining the menu to the table neighboring us. We grew increasingly impatient as our mozzarella still had not made an appearance and our waiter was no where in sight. One of our party members accidently knocked over a drink during animated conversation, and despite apologizing profusely and us helping clean up with our available napkins, it elicited no response from our waiter. He finally asked her what she was drinking, and said he would bring another. Furthermore, during this hour-long wait, I had nearly finished my root beer with no refill being offered either. Finally, they showed up with our main courses, sans napkins and silverware, but our appetizers had been apparently forgotten. Our waiter made a brief appearance during this time, and at least gave us silverware, but only stayed around long to here us request that our appetizer be taken off our bill since it never arrived before dashing off again before I could request a refill. He then showed up with that previously ordered replacement drink, which we then later saw on the tab that he had charged for it. We then finished our meal, and decided to at least get dessert and also take advantage of the free dessert we had been promised for our birthday girl. We ordered two pizookies, one being free, thinking that would be sufficient. However, our server failed to mention that the free dessert is apparently a personal size.

Veggies or herbs should not be included in a kid's dish. I'm pretty sure the veggies on my vegetarian pizza were rancid. It smelled and tasted off.

I knew nothing about the place and neither of us had dined here before. So my entire experience was all first impressions.  BJ's impresses when you first walk in. It's a very open and spacious bar look and it was pretty busy even for a rainy Monday. The first thing people may want to know about the place is that it isn't a romantic setting in any way. The ceiling is very high and it has a ""stadium"" like feel and there is a loud murmur from the crowd at all times. The only people you can hear are the people in front of you. If you're looking for a quiet dining, this isn't the place.  Our waiter was exceptional. He answered all our questions and was fast and courteous.  The first thing you will hear, (and will be a common theme) is ""hand crafted"". This buzzword is abused here. Hand crafted beer, soda, pizza, blah blah blah. Who cares? Does it taste good and is it a value? The brewed Beers are clearly listed on a giant blackboard so that there is no confusion. The ""hand crafted"" sodas are actually really nice as they add a great deal of variety from the common Coke, Sprite, Dr. Pepper (""Is Mr.Pib okay?) nonsense from every other restaurant... ever. åÊ  The food is where this place looses that fifth star. For what little I was exposed to on my first visit, it was delicious. My friend had a ""hand crafted"" pizza and I had a deep dish lasagna. We debated on the large selection appetizers. Ultimately we got a åÊpepperoni pizza dip that was creative and really tasty. But, the quality and the taste of the food was not the issue.  The price was.  Holy crap. $15- $17 for a personal size pizza? Really? I hate to be ""That guy"" but you can get a large specialty (everything) pizza at Dion's for $12. åÊDion's is the freaking place to beat in New Mexico and every New Mexican knows it. Pizza places just need to realize and accept that. This may be a chain restaurant, but please do some research! There's literally a Dion's Pizza connected to the SAME PARKING LOT. åÊ Aside from the pizzas, I perused the entire menu. There isn't a single adult entree under $13. When you realize what you are eating is pretty much glorified bar food, it puts that into perspective. It's hella tasty glorified bar food, but still glorified bar food.  One thing that I will mention, and this is either a positive or negative depending on your personal opinion; The menu is huge. When they hand it to you, you're like: ""Golly, that is a weighty tome!"".  All in all, I enjoyed my experience at BJ's and I have every intention of visiting again.

If you've never been to a BJ's, then you might not know that the menu is overwhelming and full of options. åÊWithout having counted, there are easily around 100 dishes to pick from. åÊSo far, I've tried burgers, fish and chips, Cajun pasta, and a few different chicken dishes. åÊThey offer sandwiches and pizzas, but I've yet to be in the mood to order that or a steak. åÊThe burgers were good- probably not what I'd normally order with so many other things that are so delightful on the menu. åÊThe Cajun pasta was seasoned nearly perfectly and had the right amount of spice. åÊThe fish and chips seem to be popular and for good reason! åÊThese are possibly the most delicious example of fried fish I've managed to have outside of the UK. åÊBut the absolute best dish I've had at BJ's Brewhouse is the Balsamic Chicken. åÊSounds like something that wouldn't be as amazing as it is, but this dish has consistently blown me away. åÊThe chicken is lean and tender, served on a bed of fresh greens with the most incredible balsamic glaze on top. åÊThis also comes with well-cooked onion straws, which work very well with the flavors. åÊWhite cheddar mashed potatoes finish off this delight and are the best mashed potatoes I've had (a side I usually don't even like). Of course, the biggest draw of this establishment is the beer. åÊBJ's Brewhouse has the most amazing beers. åÊI've tried about half by now and they've all been prime examples of perfection in brewing. åÊMy personal favorite is the Hefeweizen, which is on the lighter side. åÊIt has a very light taste that can take on different flavors, from refreshing and crisp to full and almost buttery. åÊAnother that I've tried which is a great example of a dark beer is the PM Porter, which offers a flavors like chocolate in a beer. åÊThe Irish Red is also very good, but I can't imagine picking it over the above two. åÊThe great thing is that if you aren't sure which one you will like, you can get a sample glass, which is more that enough to help you make up your mind.

Called them, I had to harass them to get any answers because I knew I hadn't just left it on the table but that the waiter had actually not returned it. Finally, a manger admitted to me that the waiter had taken my card home and wouldn't bring it back! What the heck?! So I cancelled it and ordered a new one.  The last time I went there I ordered my usual. The same thing I get EVERY time. But, guess what? Instead of my french dip being served with au jus (you know- like all French dips are) they served it with this gross balsamic, oil dip. Ew! I was so grossed out and disappointed. I complained to the waitress thinking they had given me the wrong thing only to be told that's what they serve it with now? Really? That's interesting because that's not a French dip.

We could tell our waitress was having an off night, we all do, so we were patient with the slower service, its a Saturday night after all. We got our pizza, about 45-1hour in and my friend originally was turned off by the tomatoes ... our bad, no big deal we can scrape them off ... then we start eating and find other random toppings in our pizza, stray toppings maybe? When our waitress came back my friend was just going to order something else but I asked why we had all of these extra topping on our pizza and at first she asks us ""did you read the menu and see what toppings came on what you picked?"" until she remembered we ordered a build your own and put our order in wrong. No big deal, just don't yell at us about reading the menu when it wasn't our bad. After that was when it got weird. We ended up having a manager come take our order again, then we waited another 45 mins for our pizza to come out. So much for shopping at this point ... then when it came out it was wrong again. We flagged our waitress down and said we're done, we'll pay but we've been here nearly two hours and our orders been taken wrong twice. She ran and got another manager instead of dealing with us, he offered to comp our meal, but at that point my friend who really needed to eat was just wanting to leave to & get a sub sandwich to get her blood sugars åÊinto check.  If we come back it will be after awhile, we understand bad nights ... its just tough with a person in tow who needs to eat in a timely manner ... and don't blame other people for mistakes that you made. :-/",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-hurst?start=10086,David S.,"Fort Worth, TX",1,28,6,4,5/13/2015,We eat here fairly often (among all the ones in the DFW area). åÊThey can be hit miss - but more times more favorable than not...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-hurst?start=10087,Zainah U.,"Fort Worth, TX",31,40,41,4,3/18/2014,"Came for the pizookie, stayed for the pizza.

The broccoli cheddar soup is thick and tasty and the fried calamari make for a delicious appetizer.  It gets pretty busy on weekend evenings but midafternoon Sundays are a great time to go. Plus the portions are pretty big so a 3 o'clock meal just may satisfy you for dinner! It does for me. The staff are pretty friendly and attentive and the music is good. It does tend to get a bit loud in there, though, and the ginormous televisions everywhere you look are distracting. I wish restaurants wouldn't use TVs because I like to converse during dinner.

I took about half the pizza to go for lunch the next day and after sprinkling a little Parmesan on it it was actually better tasting straight out of the fridge the next day than it was fresh.

On this Saturday (7/3), on our way to see Toy Story 3, I finally got my chance.  There was a bit of a wait (afternoonish), but we used that time to look over the very extensive menu. I do think BJ's would be a good choice for a group when nobody can agree on where to eat, as I think there truly is something for everyone here.  Also during the wait I notice this little stack of business cards that reads ""Call ahead for a table 817-595-3705"", which would have been a great idea for us since we had a show time to make. You can also call ahead for food, or even order on-line. When you get to BJ's, you don't even need to get out of your car. Just call the number on the sign marking in the reserved ""to go"" spaces, and they bring the order out to you for curb-side pickup.  So Thuy decides on the ""THAI SHRIMP LETTUCE WRAPS"" (Grilled shrimp glazed with spicy Thai sauce, served on a bed of Napa cabbage, cilantro, carrots and red onion, all tossed with a fresh, minty mango salsa and sprinkled with toasted coconut. Served in butter lettuce cups with a spicy Thai sauce for dipping.). Dad and I decide to split a SPINACH & ARTICHOKE pizza. Yeah, he wanted something with meat on it, but I talked him out it.  As soon as we meet our server, we let him know we have a show to catch and that we are ready to order. With help from our server, we ordered a medium size pizza. He also tells us the pizza will take 15 minutes, so props for that. We'll be cutting it close to showtime, but we should be OK.  For drinks Dad goes for a ""handcrafted"" (never did find out what that means) cream soda, Thuy gets a ""fresh-squeezed"" lemonade, and I go for a beer (obvious choice). Now I thought I saw a sign on the way in that said BJ's was brewing a Belgium-style white beer, so that's what I ordered. What arrived was a bottle of Hoegaarden. Turns out whatever sign I thought I saw, was not for an in-house white beer, or so I was told.* Oh well. It's still a good beer, which I drank down thinking how I'll be more careful with my next beer order. The lemonade and soda were also OK, if you like that sort of thing.  So the food arrives and all I can say is everything is fine. Thuy's shrimp wrap thing is tasty. Our pizza is very good. While billed as ""thick crust"" it's not what I consider a ""Chicago-style"" thick crust. Compared to Chicago, BJ's is more of a medium crust, which to me is a good thing, as I don't like thick pizza. I also take this opportunity to order an actual ""brewed on the premises"" beer. I went to the other end of the spectrum and went with the TATONKA STOUT. I'd compare it to a Guinness, which is to say, I enjoyed it.  Other than the beer snafu (see below), It was a good experience. Service was a tad slow, and we did not get out quite as fast as we wanted, but we still made it to the theater before the movie started (previews were still rolling), so it's all good. I'll definitely be back, even if it's just to sit at the bar and try a few more beers (and maybe a personal-size pizza).  * Looking at BJ's web-site ( ), I do see that they have a seasonal ""Belgian-style Witbier (or White Beer)"" called ""NIT WIT"", available at ALL BJ's from June 1 to July 31.

What happens is that you are suppose to call the number on the sign, in the curbside pick up spot. Then someone is suppose to answer and bring out your food. No one has ever answered, thus making me go inside to get it. Completely makes the curbside pick up offer USELESS.  I've also encountered that they do not handle a group of 10+ very well.

For those who don't know, egg rolls are not any type of traditional food. They were invented in America/for Americans. So to say they are good for something ""Americanized"" isn't completely correct, but you get where I'm going with it. They have a great amount of avocado in them. They come fried and with a sweet dipping sauce. The sweet dipping sauce is very good but you can tell how terrible it is for you. Not that the rest of it is much healthier either haha. They are categorized as a shareable appetizer, but for someone with a small appetite, it can definitely be a meal.  They have a decent lunch specials menu, beginning at $5.75. They have an unlimited salad and soup option, which is always good for variety. I don't particularly like their caprese salad but I can be a cheese snob. It's another option next to traditional salad options; cesar or house. They have a strong tomato bisque soup and their broccoli cheddar is VERY GOOD. They also have a one topping personal pizza option, which kind of sucks. It's ~$7.75 and then 50 cents extra per topping. For an already small option, it's not priced accordingly in my opinion. Their pizzas are VERY GREASY THOUGH and could use more pizza sauce. I normally DON'T ORDER THEIR PIZZAS. But I think their known for them? I've had some of their other entrees and their salads, so you can't really go wrong here as a quick, good lunch option. Dessert here is SO GOOD. Pazookis (is that how you spell it) which you get one for free on your bday. Is a type of cookie and a type of ice cream scooped on top. The cookie is warm so it melts the ice cream a bit. It's just the right PERFECTNESS you want and expect from BJ's. It's their twist on the traditional molten cakes a lot of ""American"" restaurants offer.  My normal chain restaurant disclaimer: I like to comment more about the service, cleanliness, and the process experience when it comes chain restaurants because these are the main factors that vary between them. They all have the same menu. Although I go into more details regarding the menu here because despite this being a large chain, I have known many people who haven't had it before.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-hurst?start=20119,Mary Elizabeth W.,"New Orleans, LA",109,119,39,5,12/16/2015,"After a looooooong drive from New Orleans to Hurst, TX, all we wanted was a warm meal and a cool beer and BJs delivered both!

Here were the hiccups:  1) I understand it was game five of the World Series in which the Dodgers were playing, but they did tell me they could tune one TV on the patio to the Steelers prime time game. Unfortunately, it took them 20-30 minutes to finally get the TV to which they directed us to the right channel. They originally set a different TV to that game to accommodate the other Steeler Nation party on the patio. I wouldn't have minded moving if it hadn't been for the fact that we were seated way before they even showed up. So once they finally tuned the correct TV, they had the other party move to our TV area. 2) We ordered an appetizer sampler platter that came out after our entrees.  3) My steak was raw. Not rare. Raw. And worse, this was a ribeye, so the fat hadn't rendered out. I hate sending food back but I had to in this case. My other gripe regarding this was then being asked if I wanted a new steak or my old one cooked longer. Ehhh I think a new steak should have been the default action. But I just asked for the latter because I'm a chickenshit and didn't want to seem fussy. I guess I deserved the charred piece of meat that was brought back out to me. Now, as I said, our server was a total sweetheart. He handled all of the above-referenced hiccups in a friendly and professional matter. Even when I was starting to get antsy about the football game still not being on.  I'm not sure if they were understaffed (but really, during a Dodgers World Series game??) or just disorganized but this isn't the slam dunk sports-watching joint I was hoping it'd be.

YAY!! It only seems right to review this BJ's location because the service we received last night was definitely five star worthy!  I usually go to BJ's because I love their pizza and pizookies. I've only been to this particular location once though and it was a few years ago. Yesterday I happened to be in the area because I wanted Porto's. Its literally right down the street from this restaurant and when deciding where to eat for dinner it came down to BJ's. Perfect! I put our party on the waiting list through the BJ's app and we set off in their direction.  One great thing about this restaurant is that there is a big parking garbage literally a few feet away from the entrance. You get two hours free WITH validation from the restaurant. So that makes it pretty convenient. You don't have to worry about circling around looking for parking since there is plenty of space in the parking garage.  So when we entered the restaurant I was actually shocked to see the waiting area empty! On a Saturday night?! It may have something to do with the fact that the Mayweather Vs McGregor fight was on this particular night and BJ's so happened to not be showing it so maybe people opted for the Buffalo wild wings down the street or maybe a bar in the area that was showing the fight. Nonetheless, there was hardly a wait for us. åÊWe did wait for maybe 5 minutes or less but they gave us a nice booth for a party of three so that was pleasant.  We sat down and started looking over the menu. Even though i already knew what I wanted. Our waitress came around and introduced herself, I feel bad I don't remember her name! But she was attentive during our entire visit. She gave a long intro on the restaurant's most popular and most recent additions to the menu.  This particular location offers a child's ""appetizer"" consisting of a side of fresh fruit and I believe it was a garlic knot. Super cute and I'm surprised to see that they are the only location doing this! I've gone to quite a few other locations scattered across SoCal and none of them did this for my son. So I am glad to say that this location definitely has an advantage for this with little ones! It's nice that they added this feature with the kids meals. Now on to our appetizer. We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip. The waitress put in the order quickly and we were pleasantly surprised to see it come out very VERY quickly. However, upon eating it we discovered it had a very liquid texture and the dip was COLD!! We flagged down one of the other waitresses walking around and let her know the situation. She quickly took it back and said they would make a new one for us.  A few minutes passed and our waitress showed up going asking about our appetizer. We confirmed with her it was cold and she apologized right away, mentioning that she brought it to her manager and the cooks were making us a fresh one. Imagine our surprise when the manager, Demetri, came by our table and PERSONALLY apologized for the mishap with our appetizer. He mentioned to us that he suspected there was a step in the cooking process that was skipped.  He was kind enough to take the item off our bill. And even brought the new dish to our table himself. He was very kind to us and made sure our visit was nothing less than five star. Definitely the main reason I think so highly of this location now!  The rest of the visit was great! Our food was good. The service was prompt and I definitely look forward to coming back in the future should we be in the area.

I figured I would let the anger subside so I might approach a review with objectivity over sheer animus and rage. The rage and animus persist. It was that bad.  My 12-year-old insisted on eating here for his birthday. The host assured us we would have heat lamps if we sat outside, or would have to wait an hour to sit inside, even though it was empty. He couldn't explain why.  It was a cold night. Wife, three small kids, and I kept pleading, but the heat lamps did not arrive as promised. Instead, they put one about 10 feet form out table with a dim flame that gave no heat. We were freezing.  To make matters worse, we had a horrible waiter. Neglected the table, got our order wrong four separate times, brought us cold food, and a plate of food that looked like it had fallen on the floor and molded back together by someone with filthy hands.  We decided to leave mid-way through the meal. But, our waiter disappeared. I roamed the restaurant in search of the waiter or manager. Eventually found a manager that was dressed like a slob and completely useless and unapologetic.  We should have just walked out, but waited patiently for the check. When it arrived, it had a series of items we ordered, but which never came. We reminded our waiter these items never arrived and he repeated over and over, ""I will check on it.""' We couldn't wait out in the cold any longer. Paid the full amount, including about $35 of food that never arrived.  There was not one redeeming thing about this place.

I havent had one, in literally DECADES. I dont know why but I was on a mission one recent Friday night and I just had to make my way to BJ's to have one. Good thing it closes late because we got there around 9/930pm. The place was busy as you would expect on a Friday night. We waited about 5 minutes before we were seated. We were given one of the elevated big booths which in retrospect didnt make sense, as we passed several open tables for 2 on the way to the booth. Oh well, we went with it.  Since we were on a mission for a pizookie we only ordered a couple of appetizers so we wouldnt get too full to enjoy dessert. We ordered the calamari appetizer that came with tartar sauce and cocktail sauce for dipping. I prefer cocktail sauce when eating calamari but sadly theirs was bland. It really lacked flavor. I didnt know why. The calamari was just ok. It wasnt the worst calamari I had but it certainly wasnt the best. I think the calamari could have been fresher. We also ordered the burger sliders app with crispy french fries. This was tasty as the sliders (2 with cheese; 2 without) were really good even though the burger patties were on the thin side. It was still real tasty though and the bread was good. The crispy french fries were great and went perfect with a little bit of ketchup. I would def order that again. The pizookie was GLORIOUS. It was better than I remembered it to be. We got the OG chocolate chunk with 2 scoops of vanilla bean ice cream on top. It was so good. The cookie still warm and soft went so well with a dollop of that delicious vanilla ice cream. Such a perfect dessert. Definitely needs to be shared by 2-3 people... Craving satisfied. Expectations exceeded. Service was ok. My empty water glass was sitting there for a while. I even put it at the end of the table which is usually the universal sign of ""fill me please"". We had to flag our waiter down to finally fill it. Another complaint I have was we used a Yelp check-in offer for a free pizookie with $10 spent on food. When we orginally got the check, the pizookie was on the bill. We had to remind our waiter about the supposed free pizookie and he made the adjustment to the bill and removed it. Glad he did but it should have been noted from the start that we had a free one that night. Anyway, those are the only things that come to mind service wise.

When we told her we were there before them, she had the nerve to ask the ladies behind us if that was true and they both agreed we were there before them. Instead of apologizing for her mistake, she grudgingly picked up the menus, told us to follow her, stopped at a table and said your waiter will be with you shorty and that was that.

I had people waiting for me. I arrived at the restaurant at 6:50. I spoke to the worker, Katherine. I showed her my order information on my cellphone. She stated that the kitchen was still working on my pizzas and they would be ready soon. I sat there in front of them and periodically asked if my order was ready. At least six people came and went with their take-out orders. People were going in-and-out of the dining areas.  Kathrine offered to have me pay while I waited, it took at least 20 minutes to get that correct. The manager, Armando Gonzalez, needed to come assist twice because it was done incorrectly (his fault). He came once and discounted only one pizza, then he needed to come back to discount the other. He should've got it correct the first time. The staff was running around like chickens with their heads cut off... disorganized, unprofessional, inappropriate, rude. The manager was just as bad as his staff, who he obviously does not supervise.  I waited in the restaurant for an entire hour (6:50pm to 7:50pm). There was one young male employee there, who looked at my husband and I (in the eye) and sang loudly... ""hit the road Jack, and don't come back here no more"". I should've got his name, not that it matters to me anymore... I will not be returning.

With no eye contact, she proceeds to tell each party that the wait would be five minutes.

I mean, it looked empty. åÊBut whatever. Now mind you, the couple behind me was a party of 2, but for some reason, whatever it may be, the young lady sat them before us. Why?

I mean he literally took our order and we never saw him again. Someone else brought our food and he never stopped by to check on our table. NOT ONCE. No water refills. No ""Is the food ok?"" Nothing. But again, for some reason, he made it a point to stop at the table behind us twice during their meal. Did I stink? Because I swore I was clean.  The ribeye was prepared properly. The broccoli looked like baby broccoli. The creamed corn was probably the best of the meal next to the one glass of strawberry lemonade that I had.  As I went to the bathroom, I overheard one guy at another table say ""he had been waiting over 10 mins and no service...WTF?"" But what was interesting was as I continued my walk to the bathroom, I saw 3 servers standing near a POS machine talking and laughing and another server in awe of the NBA highlights on the screen. yea...4 people, not doing their job.

We got seated by this guy at the front who kept mumbling- we could not understand what he was saying.  Our server was this girl who had a nervous giggle. Whenever we wanted to order something or ask for water she would giggle- it was odd (because really, nothing was that funny). My friend got the California Club lunch and I got the Unlimited soup and salad combo. I got the chili because I wanted something hearty and the mozzarella and tomato salad. In about 10 minutes my friend got his sandwich special first. I saw there and stared at him for a few minutes while he ate his fries, since he's a gentleman he was waiting for me to get my food so he can devour his. Several more minutes pass by and now we are wondering why ladling premade chili and a cold salad would take longer than a hot sandwich?  Finally several minutes later our server appears with my food. I was tempted to order my next round at the moment since it obviously takes forever for them to get it out but I resisted. She never returned to check up on us after we started eating. I finally caught her again and asked for the Caesar salad, they actually did give a decent portion of the chili so I didn't bother trying another soup.  My friend wanted to order dessert- he got the caramel and sea salt pizookie and I got my Caesar salad (which most of it was limp romaine by the way). We were on a bit of a time crunch because we were on our lunch break so we started getting worried when his cookie didn't come out. We also couldn't find our server anywhere and mind you the restaurant WAS STILL NOT BUSY. We had to flag down a different server so we could ask them to tell our server for our check- she finally brought it out and we immediately gave her our cards to pay.

I look through the pasta to see how much shrimp is in it and no lie there were literally 5 pieces of shrimp. I wish I took a picture. And not to mention, it tasted like Stouffers. I sent the pasta back and got a baked potato. Nothing else looked appealing on the menu except for the pizza. My husband ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken which it too tasted low quality, and had no flavor. The texture was just off and it was not fresh. The broccoli that came with it tasted like they opened a bag and threw it in a microwave. We also ordered calamari which was really good, thank God.

I could count on one hand the number of times I've sent food back to the kitchen). Once I finally got the server's attention, he carried the pizza back to the kitchen and ran it through the oven again. When he brought the pizza back, the edges and bottom were burned...and the pizza was only lukewarm.  He offered to have a new pizza made, but by this time the rest of my party had finished their entrees. I just ate what I could, and left. It wasn't fair to expect my date to sit there waiting for another pizza to cook.  I probably wouldn't be making a big deal about this if it was the first time it has happened to me there. People can, and do, screw up. Since I can remember at least four times something similar has happened in the last two years decided to say something about it.

The nice part about BJ's is that, much like every other big chain restaurant, the food is fairly consistent wherever you go. No matter where you are you know what to expect from the food at BJ's.  That isn't to say the food is amazing. The food is what you would also expect of a large chain. Good, but not as great. Their menu is too large to ensure that they can produce every meal at the highest quality. Still the quality isn't bad and you always know what you are going to get from them. In that sense I kind of love this place because when I am in doubt I know I can grab something decent here.  What I HATE about this place is the service. The service at this location is a joke, both for takeout and dine in. I've done many takeout orders from here because my work is right above here, so it is a favorite lunch meeting spot. Almost consistently I know that there won't be anyone at the to go counter to help me. I've waited 5+ minutes for someone to come out and help me. Other waiters and the host(ess) have seen me waiting and do not say anything. There is also a good chance that the food won't be ready or the order will be wrong somehow. It does not reflect well on me when I am late with the lunch because they couldn't get their service together.  When I have eaten here for lunch the service has been just as bad. This place is basically empty when I've come for lunch, yet the service moves as though they are slammed. This place is right below where I work, so it is quick to get here. Still it can take over an hour to eat and leave because the service is just that bad. Thankfully there is a way to pay with their app now, so you don't have to wait the 15 minutes for your server to get your check.  I know I'll keep coming back while I'm here because this place is convenient and the food is passable.

It was just a thick piece of dough with what seemed like a bit of cheese and absolutely no sauce. Thank god I asked for tomatos, mushrooms and olive or there would be nothing but dough. Truly crap. They should be embarrassed to put that out. I'm embarrassed for them. My husband picked it up curb side and had to talk to three different people just to get it. Also, when I ordered it over the phone, the girl repeated everything I asked to other people because she couldn't answer my questions, including asking a co-worker if she spelled tomatos right.. åÊyes, I could hear her ask. I asked if they have more cheese than sauce so I could know wether to ask for more sauce, she had no clue what I was asking of her. Omg.. never again. What a joke. End of my rant.

I tried turning them both off ( after I washed up of course) neither one would completely shut off. As I left the restroom, I approached one of the servers ( sitting on a bar stool @ the bar) & told her about the issue!  The restaurant didn't seem to busy, but our server Racheal; we noticed had quite a few tables in her area. However, ""all in all"" the restaurant during that time wasn't crowded by any means.

In looking at the receipt (after), it also stated that the soup was a main entree? Ok!! Anyway, the food took some time to arrive.  The salad was presented first, that was good. The soup arrived with the pizza & was less than luke warm & less than satisfactory! The serving size very disappointing for $6.75 ! No complaints on the pizza!  Our daughter had the kids meal & for the price /portion, the best deal of the day! $6.25 that was less than what they charged ($6.75) for that lousy soup..

In reality, this salad holds no nutrients. åÊMaybe there are some in the shredded carrots, but all this plate hold was lettuce and purple cabbage and ranch sauce...which is quite unhealthy, haha. åÊOh there are tomatoes, too. åÊYeah don't get a house salad. åÊCesar salad is probably no better.

I loved it! åÊI should have gotten 2 of these instead of that house salad.

The thick crust pizza was one with a bunch of toppings. Dough was also disappointing. The saving grace was the jambalaya and fries.

Her napkin was completely wet, and he doesn't offer to give her a new one. He did bring her a new drink, though. He never checked to see how we were doing (we were there for an hour and a half) when my brother's 1/4 left diet pepsi looked like iced tea because he needed a refill 25 minutes ago.

Their avocado eggrolls are good if you like your avocado eggrolls pure avocado (I uploaded a picture for you awesome yelpers and lurkers to see). They are a bit more avocado-y than the Cheesecake Factory avocado eggrolls, but they are nothing compared (not in a bad way; in fact, I do prefer the avocado to the non-avocado) to the CPK eggrolls because the CPK ones are filled with a bit of avocado and a bunch of non-avocado, such as bacon. But yes, the name avocado eggroll doesn't lie at BJs.  One buddy once ordered one of BJs burgers, but he had to send it back because apparently it was super gross and inedible, but I'm not to judge, since I didn't take a bite of his food.

We discovered the nachos had recently been canned from the menu so when we called to cancel, the guy said he will do the nachos. Fast forward $40: Nachos: Portion size was RIDICULOUSLY small. There was hardly any cheese, no sour cream or guacamole, just a few pieces of chicken, a few beans and chopped tomatoes, some weird sauce, and that's pretty much it folks. Now that I recall, I got better nachos at Taco Bell for god's sake.  Salad: Again portion size was RIDICULOUSLY small to the point that it looked like a $5 side salad. Straw that broke the camels back was that they used iceberg lettuce....WOW. Charging more than $12 for a side salad and you couldn't use Romaine.  Avocado Rolls: They were pretty good considering the other stuff hence the reason they get an extra star.  Overall, I hadn't been to BJ's since Cheesecake Factory opened in Glendale and now I know why.

Sadly, unlike the ""awesome BJs"" mentioned above, I can't say that I like BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse because every time I go to their chain restaurants I get the same shitty service. It appears that BJ's has a universal policy for ""suckage"" and it's obvious that they must not share tips because none of the waiting staff look out for one another. I mean why is it ""so hard"" to get some damn water? I really wish they had those buttons that Korean restaurants have because having to flag someone down for water while ""choking"" on pizza is not fun.  Also, I don't like how Happy Hour (HH) at BJ's only applies to the bar area and not the regular booths and tables. ""Deep inside"" I wished that we had gone to Yardhouse instead because at least at Yardhouse, HH extends to the entire restaurant and they have a much better beer selection with a more professional staff that actually knows what the hell the beer they are serving tastes like. For example, when we were seated at our booth I asked our server what the guest tap Magic Hat tasted like since there was no flavor profile summary on the menu. This was met by ummm let me just get you a sample instead of any attempt at a description. When I did taste the sample, Magic Hat reminded me of nasty ass cough syrup. Thank god I settled for Bear Republic's Racer 5 IPA ($6-something).  Food-wise the wife and I ended up ordering the avocado eggroll thing and a medium-sized chicken bacon pizza. The avocado egg roll ($10- something) was ""way too thick"" because it consisted of a blend of avocados and cream cheese that was so heavy that it felt like it was getting stuck ""deep in the back of my throat"". The chicken bacon ranch pizza ($20- something) consisted of chicken with bacon, cheese, red onions, diced tomatoes, and ""globs of white stuff"" that I believed to be ranch that looked nothing like the picture on the menu. Taste-wise it was okay, but it was nothing ""orgasmic"". In fact, I think that for the price, the new handmade pan pizzas at Domino's taste lightyears better for a fraction of the cost. I hate restaurants where plates are not washed properly like the plates that were brought to our table, since finding other people's particles (OPP) of food on plates is disgusting. Also, it's exasperating when I need to look specifically for my server to get a glass of water because other servers are not in charge of our booth. And lastly, I especially get irked when it becomes an ordeal just to pay and get the fuck out.  In the end it's obvious that the BJ in BJ's must stand for Bad Job because their food and service quite frankly ""blows"". That could be why there is always someone training someone because of the high turnover. And I guess I'm not down with ""OPP""! Oh yea, and despite the 2-hour free validated parking, the parking structure has blind turns and it doesn't help that it's filled with speeding assholes. åÊ -------------------- Pictures: Avocado Egg Roll Chicken Bacon Ranch Pizza -------------------- * There is a purpose to the words in ""quotations"" in my review, after all I am reviewing ""BJ's"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=220367,Bryan N.,"Arcadia, CA",247,419,94,2,11/29/2015,"The pizza wasn't good at all, prob one of the worst I've ever had.

Saturday- April 4th, 2015 around 7pm My waitress Elisa H. had the worst attitude for no apparent reason. The minute we took our seats she took a really nasty demeanor with us. When we sat down my friend was ready to order her salad, as an appetizer, and I wasn't ready to order, but I didn't care if her salad came out first, but to Elisa it was a big deal. I let her attitude slide thinking maybe I was making something out of nothing, but as our dinner proceeded I could no longer stand her attitude. I get that maybe she was having a bad day or maybe she was upset about having to work on a Saturday night, but there's no need to treat your customers poorly because of it. It's like she wanted us to leave the restaurant. My friend and I wanted dessert after dinner but she didn't even ask us and instead tossed the check on the table while we were still eating. Usually waiters ask if you want to see the dessert menu, good thing we both knew we wanted pizzokies so we let her know, but you could tell that she was annoyed because we weren't leaving. Isn't the staff supposed to want you to order more? That means you'll get a bigger tip!!  Sunday- April 12th around 12am So my friends and I came to get pizookies (yes, I love them), and we were glad that BJ's closes late. We ordered a trio and when we got our pizookies they were extremely undercooked. At first we thought it was because we had ordered one gluten free cookie, but nope all of our pizookies were grainy. It was like we were eating melted cookie dough (food poisoning alert!) We let our waitress Karla M. know about our issue and she didn't seem to like what we were telling her, so she went to get her manager. The manager (unfortunately, I didn't get his name) walks in and immediately takes an attitude with us saying that we're wrong and that pizookies are supposed to taste like that. We asked him if he wanted to take a bite but he declined as he is a diabetic. I repeatedly let him know that I'm a pizookie expert, and had just had one the week before, but he wasn't buying it. After going back and forth about our pizookie problem he reluctantly took them back and put in a new order for us. I really don't know why it was so hard for them to just take it back and bring us a new one without any rude questions or unnecessary remarks. It's like they thought we wanted a free pizookie or something. The thing cost around $9, and we only had one bite of each cookie, it's not like we had consumed the entire dessert! We called our waitress pretty quickly and addressed the problem, but they acted like we were thugs. I also don't know why we didn't get an apology. Aren't you supposed to make your customers happy, why make them feel like they're doing something wrong for speaking up.

I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants like Bj's, Cheesecake or those other ones. It's just my personal taste. Although the food is decent I'd never pick to go unless my friends insisted or I'm held hostage :) Paying for a salad that's over 1,000 calories or a sandwich that's more than 1,500 calories or so is not really ideal for me but hey that's just me. They are great though for happy hours and drinks. And of course...  drum rolls please... their PAZOOKIES! If you have not had this or know what it is you are missing out on life. A giant warm baked cookie with 2 scoops of ice cream. It's every fat person in ourselves dream along with the smokers with their munchies or anyone who loves dessert!! I recommend half chocolate chip and oreo or peanut butter! And you get a free one if it's your birthday (although I believe it's a smaller size). _Chicken åÊLettuce Wraps. This was good and somewhat on the healthier side. But nothing special. I just got this because it was one of the lightest on their menu and my friend said it was good so I tried it out. Pretty tasty and refreshing a nice appetizer to share. _Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms. This was pretty good. Comes in 6 bite sized mushrooms, filled with spinach, feta cheese, chopped mushrooms, herb bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese, then sprinkled with crispy bread crumbs and drizzled with lemon pesto sauce. The mushroom was moist and warm, a great appetizer to share! _California Club Flatbread. This was great! The flat bread was thin crusted, which I love. Grilled chicken, crisp Applewood smoked bacon, tomatoes and mozzarella cheese. Drizzled with roasted garlic aioli and topped with fresh diced avocado. Very light and not too cheesy or heavy. A little on the salty side. Great to share as well or have as your main dish.  _Barbecued Bison Burger. Lean, ground buffalo, topped with chipotle BBQ sauce, a seared green chili and pico de gallo and served on a toasted bun with Baja sauce, red onions and lettuce. Served with tangy slaw tossed with Baja vinaigrette and topped with green onions. This was just okay. Although Bison drew my attention the food was quite an opposite reaction. Was not a big fan of the bison patty seasoning. It was a bit bland. The slaw was boring and had barely any dressing.  Overall the food is decent and they offer a huge selection of pizzas, sandwiches, appetizers etc to fit anyone's need.

At the beginning we had to wait, not because they were busy, but because our buzzer was not working. Then we placed an order (only 1 pasta and 1 french fries) and it took an exact half an hour for them to bring only the fries. After waiting another 10 minutes they brought the wrong pasta. So we had to wait another 15 minutes to get the correct one. Luckily the waitress was nice and she apologized for taking too long, saying that they have a big order and they were working on it. I understand the wait because they had an unusual situation, but that wasn't the only problem. The thin fries, which I usually order and love, looked and tasted really bad as if they fried it twice using rancid oil. When I told the waitress, she looked at it and said ""that looks nasty"". It really did. So they replaced it. Also the dishes were dirty (see picture). Plus we already ordered a piazookie (which we are addicted to), but by the time we had the correct pasta and the normal fries we realized that we were there for more than 2 hours so we had to cancel the piazookie order. When we got the bill they didn't charge for the piazookie but then they brought one anyway. I asked them to take it back since I'm not charged for that. What a disorder. As if all this wasn't enough, at the end we ended up paying for the parking, even after validation, because we parked there for more than 2.5 hours. Such a disappointing experience.

They basically just baked some bread, put some tomato sauce in the center and tossed in about a quarter of a handful of olives, bell peppers and onions on top. I'm not joking.

I have taken this waitresses name off my review just to appease her, but I think it's lame that someone that I'm sure works at this BJs that knows this waitress to write someone regarding my review. Regardless if someone is a single mom or had a bad day, you need to leave your drama at home and work your hardest to get through it. Yelp is a public forum for people to write about their good and bad experiences. If I have to mention an employees name to steer consumers away from that person so they can have a better experience than I did, then I will do that. Here is my redone review: Would have given this place more stars had we had a better waitress. To all who dine here, stay away from _______(name withheld because someone was upset that a name was mentioned). She is the worst waitress alive, would disappear, lacked major communication skills and just flat out had the stink eye the entire time and her attitude sucked. Never saw one smile come to her face, she never wrote anything down and anytime we'd ask for something she wouldn't even acknowledge us. Asking for refills was the worst, we'd ask and she wouldn't even acknowledge that we asked, she'd just come back 10 minutes later and would just fill up our glasses, without even smiling, no your welcome, nothing.  I'm not a fan of the Burbank location and now I'm really not a fan of this place. The parking here sucks just as bad as Burbank too. Free 90 minutes. At the rate our waitress was going, we were just 15 minutes over 90 minutes. For some reason we owed $5.50 in parking for those extra 15 minutes. I'm done coming to this area in Glendale. ****I would also like to add that this review was not powered by the fact that I didn't get a smile with my refill like the angry complimenter had stated, it was because she was a rude person that day that didn't take the time to see if we needed anything else after she dumped the food on our table. Everything she did was done with attitude.

So, we walk in and it's not busy at all (except for the bar where a soccer game is on). Our waiter comes right over and asks if we are ready to order our drinks and food. Whoa buddy, although I appreciate the enthusiasm, we literally just sat down, can you give us a minute to view the menu? Here's where it all went downhill. FRY-GATE. We ordered our entrees, along with a side of thin fries. Impossible to screw that up right? Wrong. Their first attempt came out cold and NOTE TO BJ's: shoestring fries should be somewhat crispy, not like soggy actual shoe stings. Next attempt: Still not hot and still soggy as hell. So fed up, we ask to try the thick fries. Next attempt: As I type this I'm still waiting, because they never came. Our food arrives... Mine was the chicken quesadilla which was ok -- stingy on the chicken and cheese and was not really filling at all. We tell our waiter that the fries never came and he goes to check on them... Instead of coming back with the fries, he asks us if the manager came by... All 3 of us say in disgusted unison: ""No"". Off he goes to get the manager.... The manager never comes... Instead our waiter asks if we'd like a pizookie. Since we are still eating and since we are pissed and waiting on a manager who would never come, we assumed that the manager didn't want to deal with the situation, so he authorized this peace offering, which we accepted. Lo and behold when the bill comes, we are charged for the pizookie!! Wtf! We see the manager across the room and try to wave him down. He ignores us. Meanwhile, we just want our check so we can get the hell out of there, but now our waiter is M.I.A... Naturally!

Most of it was colorful and had zig zaggy sauce stripes across the plates of nachos or bruschetta. There was the resident cheese dip of some sort that almost tempted me, but knowing there was a Damon's cheeseburger in my future, I stood strong. The crowd seemed to be a nice bunch of after work folks. Some dressed in ties, some perhaps coworkers sneaking off for a date/drink after work and definitely a few first dates. I love people watching and am pretty good at it and definitely heard a few, ""soo, what kind of movies do you like!"" Aha, first date 101. There was also a nice pair of gentlemen sitting at a table with a number of free seats who kindly offered them up to us girls standing around the bar. And here I read that chivalry was dead!

I mean, who's going to complain about a BJ's experience? You can't complain about eating out... But when it came to this BJ experience, I have to say.. this one sort of sucked.  If you've read that paragraph in any way other than it was intended.. well then, you have a dirty mind my friend. And that's more than likely why I will call you friend. Besides, you can't blame me for making those easy jokes. The pizza place named BJ's will get mocked by me like the Costco like whole salers store chain in the South called BJ's Whole Sale which also sales BJ's Gas. Believe me, that's gas you'd want when you're getting serviced to fill you up with BJ's....  On to the review. First off, for as many times as I have been on Brand, I haven't ever really bothered coming tot his BJ's. I saw no need with a better one that felt more at home in Burbank. Not to mention that with Porto's just a stones throw away, I'd rather have myself some Porto's sandwich. So when I decided to come to this one it was a brand new BJ's experience...(I'm really not this immature.. I swear) There's something I love about BJ's (I'm not even going to try.. that one says it all itself) I love the beer. Their beer is really good and there's a variety of flavors that one can try.. So when I saw an ad for the 10th Anniversary ale, I just had to try it. So when I sat down It was the first thing I ordered. The waiter, in a rare BJ's situation let me completely down. Told me  ""Oh, sorry, we just ran out of that yesterday""  and to and insult to injury followed it up with  ""Oh it was really good.""  Dick move.. Dick move. Rub it in more how I'm not going to chug some delicious fluid down in this BJ outing.  Got to ordering pizza and the waiting game began. Now I know full well how long it normally will take for a Pizza order to get put out.. and I'm a pretty patient person, but it did feel like the pizzas took their sweet time to get out there. So when that happened we decided to order the pizookie at that point so that we can make sure we're not waiting too long after the pizza is done to get it... bad move. You could even say it was a bit of a... Boner (Ooooooooh!)  Most places would wait a while to put the order in, they were really quick to the punch and the pizookie came out while we were still working through the pizza. What the hell, timing should be a major sticking point. A good server doesn't bring out desert so quickly. It's sort of premature at that point. And really, the last thing you want is all your stuff to come out quickly.. åÊ Pizookie was good, but how could they not be considering what it's made out of.

The first strike was lunch one day: we were seated immediately (plus!) but then we were not visited by a wait staff for over 20 minutes. you might be thinking, hey, they were probably busy - well no, that's not the case. There were 6 tables full. We couldnt even get a wait staff to make eye contact. they have all mastered the look off into the distance without being available... Strike two: On another trip, that part of the visit went fine, we were seated and helped immediately, but our food took over 40 minutes to get to us. And by the time it finally made it to us, it was wrong. there were 6 of us and they got 2 orders mixed up, 2 orders were completely wrong and they forgot my boss' order completely - as in, they forgot to make it/place it for those 40 minutes. Strike three: Again, I am not a picky eater. However, the food I ordered was so bland and tasteless and wilted/sad looking that I barely picked at it. It was so unmemorable I cannot even remember what it was I ordered to report it here.  Like I said, other BJs are great - I love their beer and their ""buffalo style"" pizza is to die for! However, this one needs work on wait service and in food quality...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=660649,Brito M.,"Los Angeles, CA",188,60,26,2,8/26/2011,"ehhh don't waste your time. I went to BJs for my first time with some coworkers, and I wouldn't really recommend this place for any event... really. åÊ Firstly, I seriously dislike menu overload. With every cuisine option imaginable, BJ's has no focused speciality resulting in mediocre food. Too much quantity equals low quality. To help me select one of BJ's best items, I asked my waitress what is good, and she replied, ""I eat everything."" (Although it seems impossible with their 2000 items, she really did look like she ate everything).  She also appeared slightly disturbed that I wasn't completely ready to order, and that I was taking her time away from something else. I'm sorry maym, the reason you're employed over a computer is so you can adequately attend to patrons, so LIE TO ME and tell me any item on the menu! She might have had too many tables than she could handle. Throughout the dinner she rarely visited our table, and was very short when she was present.  Anyways, I decide to order the avocado roll for appetizer, caesar salad, bacon cheeseburger(highlighted on the menu) with shoe string fries, and the pizookie. Avocado Roll - surprisingly good, but not restaurant quality (I do believe I could have preheated that from a box, and it would have tasted the same) Casear Salad - Average Burger - Average Fries - Sad. Very Sad. They were just not vivacious or anything to enjoy. Plate fillers really.  Pizookie - REALLY delicious! We ordered a half peanut butter, half chocolate chip combination, and it was GONE in 3 seconds. This is remarkably similar to UNO's deep dish cookie.  The food was just too bland, and the food coming out of the kitchen was slow and sporadic! The appetizer took forever, and then our salads all arrived to the table individually. (This isn't that big of a deal, but why couldn't you just wait until the salads were prepared?) After finishing the food we had, we waited patiently for the main course. We were then told by the manager that one of the dishes was taken out and given to another table, so we were to wait longer for our entree. Fine. Things happen, but what REALLY turned me away was the 12 minute dessert! By this time, my stomach enzymes are telling me I'm full ! I strategically eat everything possible before I'll feel that I'm full so I can eat more! This was RUINED.

The rest of my party seemed to enjoy their food.  The server was very friendly and nice but the actual quality of the service was lacking.

Days of infamy. When BJs first came to Glendale, I was stoked. Not stroked. Stoked. Why? Because Glendale sucks. Glendale has very little in the way of variety when it comes to lunch fare. Glendale perpetually smells like garlic and onions, and not in the good way. Glendale's trash trucks drive around with signs saying ""Don't trash Glendale. Don't litter"" and you wonder ""What does it matter? This city kinda sucks anyway"". But BJs offered that brief ray of hope. Sure, it's a really similar concept to CPK which is just up the escalator from it, and there's an Olive Garden in the same building. Sure, I can't take advantage of the beer selection at lunch. But there was hope nonetheless, in the form of their salads, and their deep dish pizza, and their lunch specials. Hope that was in vain, it turns out. Why? Because the food just doesn't do it for me anymore. It's over priced for one, which was excusable when I liked it. But lately it just feels like eating anything from there is akin to trying to use Crisco as an exfoliant. It's greasy, it's over priced, it just doesn't cut it. It's hard to really attack the food of a chain restaurant. It's all the same, and BJs seems to be pretty consistent. Not bad, but not thrilling anymore. It is what it is.

I have to start by saying I am a fan of the type of food they serve--most of the time I will be happy choosing from a wide variety of plain, American-style food: salads, soups, big ole sandwiches with a pile of fries, pastas, and of course their deep dish pizza.  I usually order off the sandwich menu and have yet to find something I don't like. Their soups are hearty and the pizzas are rich, although I've had friends complain about the chunkiness of the sauce. Food always gets a solid 4 stars.  This particular location is actually quite a bit better than the others I frequent. It beats the Westwood location as far as wait times, layout (the Westwood one is impossible to navigate), more grown-up clientelle, and parking! The Burbank location seems a bit more family-oriented, and the fact that they have valet only sucks! Parking and crowdedness also knock off point for the Culver City and Belmont Shore/Long Beach locations. In relation, this BJ's has a lot more going for it than the other locations I frequent.  My only gripe with this chain is their beer--for ""hand-crafted, silver award winning"" brews, they are hit-or-miss and pretty mediocre.

There's been a major turnover in staff and things are improving. Updated 1/27/08 -It didn't take long for this BJs to loose two stars - and believe me, those are only for the beer, which is sometimes far from being spot-on. But the reason why I've reduced my rating from four stars to two is because, with the exception of my first visit there, there hasn't been ONE time that I have eaten here when there wasn't an issue with the quality of service received.  For example: during a recent visit on a Sunday afternoon. I wanted the fish sans chips - in other words, fish n chips w/o the chips.  Our waitress was polite and helpful, took our order quickly, repeated it back to us, and brought our drinks to us without much of a wait. However, things went from good to awful when a server came with our food, slammed it down on the table and walked away. Problem was, she brought fish and chips - exactly what I didn't want - and there was no sign of my salad.  After about five or so minutes, I managed to get her attention and explained to her that I'd ordered fish only, no chips and wanted a substitute salad instead.  Without a word, she stomped away, and came back a few minutes later and SHOVED - literally SHOVED - the salad across the table at me. I said - politely - ""Excuse me, but ...."" and before I could finish she said, ""You wanted a salad. Well there it is."" And she stomped away again. Rather than make a scene, I quietly asked another server for a manager. We explained the situation to her and she apologized profusely for the behavior of this person and gave us a complementary pizookie.  Other weird stuff has happened since then, including being brought our bill WITH our meal and being told that it was a company policy.  There were two occasions where our party had to wait 20 minutes for our drinks, and then had them served in plastic cups because they ran out of clean glasses. C'mon folks - it's a BREWERY with a full bar, for goodness sake! People WILL order drinks, and plenty of them! The food quality has gone down rapidly, as has the service, which is sad because when this place first opened, it wasn't unusual for me to come here two or three times a week. I work on the opposite end of Brand, and the place was a favorite among our sizable group. Sadly, we will have to find another place to frequent. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ There's a new BJ's Brewhouse in town, and from what I've experienced so far, it's good - really good!  I've been a long time frequenter of the Arcadia location, and have been to Burbank several times as well. The food in Arcadia is sub-par compared to what it used to be about 5 years ago, and we always get spotty, if not weird service in Burbank. I love the decor at this location, which is less sports-bar-esque and more restaurant trendy for the office crowd on North Brand. There are still a number of televisions scattered about, but this place seems to be more about enjoying a good session beer or two (of which they have a few), or a night out with a special someone, or just to hang with friends. But I don't go to BJ's for the decor, I go for the brews. And considering that this place is brand new (just over two weeks old at the time of this writing) - and given that a lot of things can go wrong with house brews, åÊthese guys mostly got it right the first time. My favorite BJ's brew, the Piranha Pale Ale, was a bit flat the first night I visited. Not quite enough CO2 in the mix for my taste, and not quite the level of signature hoppy bitterness I prefer. But the Nutty Brewnette (not me - the beer) was spot on, and was smooth like butta.  On subsequent visits - and there have been a few because I work just up the street - every beer I've had has been fresh and tasty, just like momma likes 'em. As for the food...I've found BJ's to be sorely lacking in the grub department as of late, but the folks in the Glendale kitchen have it goin' on. From pasta to fish and chips, the food I've sampled here has been well prepared, served hot, and is quite tasty. And last but not least - service. I know these folks are new, but on one occasion, we were seated at a table near the bar, and while nearly eight different servers passed us by, not one stopped to see if we'd been helped.  Finally, after having his back to us and serving the table immediately next to us, I caught the eye of one guy who rather reluctantly asked, ""Has anyone helped you?"" We said no, to which he replied, ""Well, I don't know where the guy is who is supposed to be here, but I guess I can help you. "" Gee, thanks? Other than that, I've been quite happy with my overall experience here, and I'll definitely be going back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=740745,Javier M.,"Los Angeles, CA",63,9,,1,11/25/2012,"Bad service.

There was a 30-45 minute wait, but I couldn't blame them because there was a football game on and no one was leaving. When we were finally seated, we started off with the avocado egg rolls which I found to be surprisingly good. It had a sweet dip on the side that complemented the avocado really well. As for drinks, I had a Pomegranate Sunset, which I liked. It wasn't strong, I didn't get a buzz, but it was refreshing. My friend got the Raspberry Lemon Drop, and it was way too sweet. In fact it tasted like liquid candy. Between the two of us, we couldn't even finish it, but I could say that it was stronger than the one I had. åÊFor the main course, I had the fish tacos. I did not enjoy them AT ALL. I don't even know what possessed me and made me think that a place like this would have good fish tacos. They were super dry, even with the dips and chips on the side. I finished one and had to force-feed myself the other one. That definitely killed my experience there. Then we both had Strawberry Splashes, which turned out to be an all-time favorite. It had the consistency of a smoothie and had a slight pineapple aftertaste. Again, it didn't give me a buzz, but oh well, we both enjoyed it. Service was a little slow. We started off with a female server who went MIA on us. Then about half an hour later, a male server approached us and said that our previous server had gotten cut and was sent home and that he would be our server for the rest of the night. I thought that because we had a new server that we would get better service, but it took forever to flag the dude down. Whatever. So its minus a star for the slow service, and minus a star for the waste of 9.75 fish tacos. Oh and for dessert, my friend and I shared a White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Pizookie.

I spoke to the manager, a nice man - and he apologized and explained to us that it was a miscommunication due to our original waitress going on break. He offered to buy us a dessert to go, on the house but we declined. He also asked if there was anything he could do to make it better, but I said no. I simply just wanted to let him know that we were unhappy with the service. I did explain to him though, that everything else was fine as far as food went. Probably won't come here for a while again.

I come back for the GF pizza and GF beer, but when I do, I expect nothing less than HORRIBLE service every single time.....at least I'm never disappointed! The first experience I had was with their takeout. They have a little door to the left of the main entrance to go through in order to get to the takeout/pickup area. I didn't see it and walked through the main entrance. I walked passed the two hostesses, they pointed out the pickup area and I walked over to an empty area....no one there to help me. I continued to stand there for what seemed like 5 minutes. I tried to stop two people who happened to be walking by and I know they heard me, but didn't even acknowledge me. My friend and her boyfriend came in after me wondering what was taking so long. They both tried to get someone to even look at us and nope. Finally someone walked out from the kitchen and assisted us in paying. My most recent experience was two weeks ago. I went there with a couple of friends who were in the area visiting. I prepared them by making sure they knew this was going to be a very long meal. It was 9pm when we arrived on a Sunday evening. There were no other customers in our seating area and the server confirmed we were her only table. We ordered alcohol and it was served 20 minutes later. One of my friends couldn't decide what she wanted so the server left and didn't come back until 20 more minutes later. By this time, we are ordering more alcohol, appetizers, and our meals. 25 minutes later, food finally comes out - but it's all the food; our appetizers and our meals at the same time. We ordered drinks one more time before the end of the meal. We have now been in the restaurant for about an hour and 20-25 minutes. No check brought to the table. I ended up getting up and walking all the way to the hostess stand in order to pay the bill. Needless to say, that bill was around $125. I tip nicely and would have easily given her at least $30, but I don't tip nicely with horrible service. The thing that worries me the most is that corporations come into small cities like Brentwood, don't do anything about their service, and when people no longer wish to settle for that service, instead of changing, they close the store and leave the city in financial peril.

The wait before and after seating is agonizing if you go with an appetite; this last time despite trying to be ahead of the curve and ordering in advance online, apparently their online system was not working properly at their end, the order was lost and there were all kinds of problems straightening it out - it took 45 minutes for the first sight of food, another 20 minutes to get the main course. Our salads were served without utensils - it took three requests to finally get a fork, the hostess at the front desk was not at all helpful, the server seemed overwhelmed and his backup person ditto. This was mid afternoon, intentionally planned to avoid dinner (or lunch) rush and there were many tables and booths vacant - maybe less than 50% capacity. Because of the apparent disorganization I think perhaps there is a management problem. The servers were trying hard to do their job... with a smile, however, the good service mark was seriously missed. This is a fun place to go but you decide if you can endure the wait and possible service problems before finally getting a meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brentwood?start=180163,Sam S.,"Oakley, CA",0,13,1,5,7/01/16,As anyone reading this would know best pouzouki's ever.

I've been here several times and the food is always good, and tonight was no exception! We ordered two appetizers, the fried artichokes served with a chipotle aioli, which my wife loved, and the corn fritters which I loved. The fritters were perfectly textured! My wife ordered the California chicken flatbread pizza, and enjoyed it's delicious simplicity. I had the jalapeÌ±o burger. The jalapeÌ±os were crispy fried, which gave it a nice crunchy texture, inside that juicy burger. Very good..!! That was the ""center"" of our experience tonight. The ""beginning"" and the ""end"" is where the two stars came from. After being seated, no one approached our table for some time. In fact, it wasn't even our server who finally took our drink order, it was some other server filling in for our station's server, who was too busy to even notice us. When she did come to take our drink order, we already knew which appetizers and entrÌ©e's we wanted to order, which can be challenging at BJ's, because of their extensive menu!  I ordered my favorite beer there, the Nutty Brunette, and my wife ordered her standard lemonade. My beer wasn't very cold when it arrived, which in my opinion is just wrong! It's a brewhouse for crying out loud, and beer should be served icy cold!  When our entrÌ©e's arrived, no one came back to ask if we needed anything, at all, until it was too late that is. I like mayo on my burger and it was not served with mayo. After waiting a few minutes, trying to flag someone down for mayo, I ended up using the chipotle aioli that came with the fried artichokes, on my burger, and it made the burger even more outstanding, so when someone finally came by to see if we needed anything, we didn't.  When our server came to ask if we wanted dessert, we said no thanks, but did ask for an ice water for me and a refill on my wife's lemonade. It didn't come. I thought she forgot about us. We didn't see her anywhere! Seriously, 15 minutes later we finally flagged down another server and asked if she could find our server, and tell her we would like to get our check.  A few minutes later, here comes our server with a huge tray of drinks, which included ours that we no longer wanted. After dropping off our drinks, she gave us our check, just as I handed it back with my credit card in it. Obviously, we were ready to leave! Rather than running my credit card immediately after emptying the rest of her drink tray, she stops at a table of 8 to take their dinner order first. Big mistake!  At this point, her tip has been compromised. No matter how good the food is, when the service is this bad, there's no excuse. Yes, it was 6pm on a Saturday night, but a person shouldn't have to wait for a Wednesday to go out to dinner just to get good service, in my opinion.

The food leaves something to be desired, if its even made correctly. I have never once had my food come back the way that I ordered it. I am NOT a difficult person, & I do not ask for a lot of things to be excluded or added to my meal. Generally I try to find things that I am able to eat without doing any substitutions. I am allergic to a few items that can cause a serious reaction. I try to stay away from those types of foods because I do know that sometimes accidents happen. With that being said, I had ordered some sort of chicken sandwich that avocado on it. I requested that the avocado be left off. When the food was delivered my sandwich ended up having avocado on it. I sent it back and requested that the avocado and the top bun be removed As I am highly allergic to avocados. 10 minutes later my sandwich returned without avocado. When I lifted the bun I noticed that all they did with take the avocado off and left the bun that was saturated with creamy avocado paste. I tried to flag our server down several times and was not successful until the end of the meal. I ended up not eating and placing the sandwich into a to go container which I inevitably threw away. The other thing that really bothers me about this place is the fact that there's a different person that approaches your table for every stage of your meal.

The food is excellent and they charge only half for virgin drinks, which is why my friends and I continue to go back there, but there have been some problems with the staff. First of all, the server was really inattentive. She didn't take our drink order for like, 20 minutes. I was about to call the manager when she finally showed up. After she finally brought the food out we never heard from her again. The other servers were at least polite and filled our drinks for us on request. One of my friends is a vegetarian and usually gets a soup and salad. This was the first time we brought her with us, and they served her before everybody else and she finished before we all got our food. That's backwards. Her meal only took a minute to prepare and should have been served at the same time as the rest of us. Now I have to explicitly ask them to prepare hers last. Last time I went, it was Valentine's Day and my boyfriend and I had dinner there. I ordered a personal pizza with pepperoni and artichoke. It was expensive for being mostly bread, but the kicker was that among the artichunks there was one, single, solitary pepperoni. The server rushed off before I could stop him. I must have stared at it for a good minute wondering why somebody would make a pizza that way and consider it acceptable to serve and why the server wouldn't take one look at it and ask what was up before carrying it to my table and skittering off. I had to flag down a different server to get it replaced, and when I got the second one it had tomato chunks all over it which I had requested to be left out. The manager himself gave it to me and at that point I was more amused than I was mad. I opted to pick off the tomatoes rather than have it remade a third time because I was starving, but they threw in a free dessert and gave me a coupon for a free dessert on a subsequent visit.

It takes, at the least, 30-40 minutes for the food to actually make it to your table - and in most circumstances, that's just for your appetizer. Then when (and if) your entree gets to you, literally anything that gets put onto the grill/stovetop is slathered in oil and, ultimately, unappetizing (which should be expected, as the presentation of their food is also usually very unappealing).

Everyone was served except myself; called over the waiter, and mentioned that I hadn't gotten my order yet. The waiter checked into the kitchen and apparently the chef had either overlooked, hadn't gotten, or had forgotten about my order and it was only THEN had he started on it. Basically, was already 40-45 minutes in, and no food. The only good thing I suppose about that was that a manager who was checking in on all the tables came over and we told her about it. She apologized, and took the charge of it off our bill and a free Pizookie.

If you ask to get seated in her section and there's any problems, she'll more than make it up for you. I'd gotten her a few times last year and saw her again last night and she's still super accommodating.  One more tip: The BEST time to eat here is when they're doing they're two for $20 deal. I like their FB page so I could see when it's going on. You and another person both get soup or salad, a medium pizza, and a pizookie for the price of just the pizza itself. That's the best time to try this place out and basically the only time I come. Oh, ok, one more tip: You can customize your selections... a lot. If you're torn between two pizzas, you can order half of one and half of the other. If you get a nice waitress, they will often let you switch out one of their gourmet sodas so you can try multiple ones for the same price. You can even do half a pizookie of one flavor and half of another, change the ice cream, and apparently even add hot fudge underneath for no charge.  The service is really hit and miss, but the food is pretty good. Unfortunately, they don't have my favorite pizza anymore (the Balsamic Portabello Pizza... omg), but they still have a few good things to get.  Tried the chicken bacon ranch yesterday and I really liked it - my husband and I both don't get a lot of ranch anything, but it was really well balanced. The Mediterranean pizza is good if you like those flavors. The buffalo chicken can be really good or just meh depending on how much sauce they put on. You can ask for light or heavy sauce and they will comply. I actually love the Cheeseburger pizza which is weird, because I was so resistant to try it. I get it with no pickles. The only pizzas I don't like are their more traditional fare - you can get a better meat and combination pizza somewhere else, for sure.  The specialty pizzas are the way to go. BUT, some days they are better than others. This place has a lot of inconsistencies in cooks. Tried the new raspberry nut pizookie - yum! I love the red velvet and the chocolate pizookie, and this now goes in my top three. Weirdly tastes a bit like raspberry muffins, but in a good way.  If you like broccoli cheddar soup, I think they have the best in town. Go Sunday-Tuesday and try it. SO good. That's my favorite thing on the menu. The apps are a bit expensive for the portions (although I love the avacado egg rolls, I never get them), but the small bites are really good money-savers. You can get a pretty big, yummy bowl of fancy mac and cheese for a few bucks. If you're on the cheap, it's not a bad bet.

Well, should I say until they built the Brentwood location in my neck of the woods. The place is always hopping and there is always a wait. Their call-ahead service makes that more tolerable though. Their food is all very tasty and tastes consistent from location to location. I can say the same for their libations as well. What is lacking in this location is the service. On the fourvisits I have made there, they have done the following: Visit #1: Forgot one of the entrees. (no, I really didn't need to eat. I just came to stare at others hungrily whilst they dined). My dish came after everyone else at the table finished and they in turn had to sit there and watch me eat. Visit #2: (it's the avocado issue again) The item I wanted clearly came with avocado. So I told the perfectly communicating server that I was allergic to avocado but that I wanted the dish with no avocado. She said no problem. The dish came with avocado, I sent it back to be redone. It came back a little too quickly. I come to find that they simply took it off and there was still a green smear on the food where it once was. Visit #3: Told the server upon arrival that it was my Brother's birthday, so that they would do their birthday thing and give him a birthday pazookie. She agreed. That never happened, no apology, nada. Visit #4: We ordered an appetizer and two entrees. The entrees came out quite quickly and we thought they had just beat the appetizer. Waited, waited, no appetizer. When we questioned the server she stated that she would have it removed from the bill and that it appeared we had enough to eat on the table presently. No complaints about the food, drinks or anything else. Nor about any other location except this one. The servers in this location have been consistently bad.

That means more than 3 tablespoons should be a requirement for this dish. Every single time, this is a battle to get this right. By the way, marinara sauce is NOT spicy tomato sauce. Again, I do believe it's all dependent who the server is, kitchen staff and how busy but remember we are the paying customer.

Having visited five times since my initial review, the verdict is in: BJs is a just another mass-produced culinary disappointment with a penchant for exploiting poor customer service and average corporate food. Customer Service: With the exception of one visit we made to the bar, in which our playful bartender gladly allowed us to re-name him to suite our sensibilities, each visit resulted in the return of lukewarm food, and a server who was either too busy to check on us or too green to answer questions or provide adequate service. Since my great fall on the freshly waxed floor (a Three Stooges moment that resulted in purse contents scattering and feet leaving the floor), I've spoken with the managers and staff about how staff walked over me without a second glance as I lay there. The response? ""Did you ask for help?"" My bad! I wasn't updated on accident protocol at BJs. Note to self: if ever visiting BJs again, bring Life Alert necklace in the event of another fall; that or a microphone and portable amp for announcement to staff to stop on by on their way through. Food: Got salt? The food is fair at best. Think Chilis with more seafood options. At these prices, I'd prefer to visit a local joint that's privately owned where I'm going to get real food rather than the seemingly microwave heated options with pre-packaged sauces offered here.  Beer: Still a good beer menu no matter how you slice it. My recommendation for those with a beer hankering is to sit in the bar area where the better servers seem to work. You'll probably get a better deal at Bev Mo for a lot of these, but let's face it, you don't always want to stay home. While it may not be enough of a reason for me to patronize BJs, beer lovers are not likely to be disappointed by the hoppy options available.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brentwood?start=360396,Stephanie S.,"Brentwood, CA",457,251,279,4,9/27/2011,"Let's start off by stating the obvious... BJ's is a chain restaurant. Being that it's a chain, one would assume all the negatives a typical chain restaurant would bring. Come on now, we all know what they say about assuming things.

I do recommend the Cherry Throwback Cola. It was superb! However, it took about 30 minutes to get our food and it wasn't even busy that night.

While the rest of the shopping center struggles, BJ's packs them in because they offer something for everybody. The food selection is impressive - not quite as expansive as The Cheesecake Factory, but it still covers a lot of ground. BJ's has dishes for the pizza/calzone crowd, lighter eaters (""EnLIGHTened Dishes""), traditional food lovers, Asian fusion fans, New England Clam Chowder aficionados, the list goes on. We had the deep dish pizza for our visit. The crust was pretty good, it reminded me of the crust at Pizza Hut. The toppings a little bit scant for the price. The cheese was decent quality and the sauce was too light. We also asked for the whole wheat crust and received the regular...not cool.  The iced tea was just so so. I really couldn't taste it...no tannins at all to give it the punch I was hoping for. BJ's could learn something from Chipotle in how to make iced tea. While the minestrone was just okay, BJ's gets points for effort by offering to put it in the sourdough bread bowl and by making the top of the bowl garlic bread. Much like the Americana interpretation for all of their dishes, BJ's interior decor has a very Americana sensibility. The artwork and somewhat rustic design elements make me think of America's heartland. Maybe it has something to do with the farm murals on the outside and inside of the building. The Brentwood BJ's, which is an example of their latest model. is split into three areas - the bar, traditional booths, and the more open social area for larger groups. Each section has three completely ceiling designs - the bar has a modern mesh look, the booths a basket weave, and the more open area's ceiling is a Nordic looking upside down boat look like something from Denmark. The ceilings are framed in high quality cherrywood crown molding.  The music and overall ambiance inside the BJ's at Brentwood is very upbeat, friendly, and somewhat eclectic - again, something for nearly everybody. The restaurant is very clean and well taken care of...which it should be after being open less than two months. If I go back to the Brentwood BJ's and order something else, I might be able to give it a 4 star rating...but at this point, with an average pizza and so-so iced tea, I can only give it a solid 3 star rating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brentwood?start=360400,Bob M.,"Discovery Bay, CA",1,61,,3,11/04/11,"I guess my expectations were too high after reading all of the reviews before we tried this place.  My wife and I went to BJ's in Brentwood on a Thursday about 6 pm or so. Though there were many groups of people in line, we got right in. The staff was very friendly and informative. Our first and very obvious observation is that it's an extremely LOUD atmosphere. My wife and I had a booth for two and we literally had to shout at each other in order to communicate. My wife ordered their fish & chips, and I tried their chicken fried steak, as that's one of my most favorite ""homestyle"" types of meals. My wife said the batter they used on the fish was very good, but that the fish itself had no flavor whatsoever. åÊ The chicken fried steak just wasn't memorable for me at all, but was memorable enough to know that I'll never order it again there. åÊ There were mashed potatoes covered by two nice portions of meat, which was fine, but there was no gravy on the potatoes, and there couldn't have been much more than 2 tablespoons of gravy on the meat itself. What there was of the gravy, was very watery and didn't go very far on taste; actually the gravy had little-to-no taste at all. åÊI asked our server for more gravy, and she brought me probably not much more than a shot glass full of additional tasteless watery gravy. One of the managers came by to ask us how our meal was, and I explained my concern about my chicken fried steak, and he was the first to admit that the Black Bear Diner in Oakley does a much better job in their preparation. I told him that I'd eaten their chicken fried steak there dozens of times in the past and was very pleased. Now if you read between the lines on what this guy said, he simply stated ""Yea...some of our food sucks so you might want to go elsewhere else, depending on what you're in the mood for!""

We called and got on the call-ahead list. Arrived at the restaurant and then waited 45 minutes to be seated. There were lots of empty tables around the restaurant. Our waiter showed up about 10 minutes later to take our drink and app orders. Then, we waited 45 minutes for the drinks to arrive and the drinks were wrong. One person ordered a Pepsi with no ice. The person who ordered a black cherry soda received their drink with no ice, as did the person who ordered the Pepsi. Another person in our party ordered regular lemonade but received a strawberry lemonade that she described as ""chunky"". I personally ordered a Diet Pepsi, which I normally drink on a regular basis. It was flat and tasted like expired Diet Coke. We didn't see our waiter again until our dinners arrived, about half an our later, with our appetizers. Appetizers should come out before any main course is served. Everything came out together. There are RAVE reviews about the avocado rolls but ours were super bland and were literally avocados inside a roll. No sun-dried tomatoes, no pine nuts, no cilantro (except the pinch that was dribbled on the plate). Blech! I ordered the chicken wontons buffalo style (which comes with celery sticks and bleu cheese) and it didn't come with celery sticks or bleu cheese. We also ordered the mushrooms and the reason I gave two stars was for the mushrooms. They were phenomenal. They were the only thing that was phenomenal or had any taste at all. For my entree, I ordered the Santa Fe Salad with Cajun shrimp. I've never tasted a more bland salad in my life. I was sitting there looking right at the shrimp, half of which seemed to be slathered in seasoning and the other half completely void of seasoning. Despite the apparent over seasoning of some of the shrimp, there was no kick, spice or taste to any of it. If you're going to name something ""Cajun"" it better have some spice to it! My daughter had the Reuben which she did like...but she is also a french fry addict and after a handful said they were the worst fries ever and didn't eat anymore. We ordered pizookies for dessert and again, the waiter got our orders wrong. The pizookies were good...you can't really go wrong with ice-cream on top of a cookie...but we all ordered different ones and the wrong ones were brought out. Every time he got something wrong (I lost count) I didn't say anything because it had taken so long to get anything to begin with, I could only imagine if he'd had to correct something. We'd probably still be sitting there. The kicker was that I told our waiter it was my daughter's birthday and I don't know if they don't do anything for birthdays there, but he brought out her pizookie with a candle on it and that was it. Big freaking whoop. All that aside, and the waiter screwing up our orders, etc. the reason I won't go here again is because the food is total crap. Boring, cold, bland, unseasoned, and just all together tasteless. I am actually writing this review the next afternoon because I took most of my salad home to have for lunch today. I honestly thought that maybe I was just having a bad taste bud night (LOL) and gave the salad another shot this afternoon. Nope. Nothing. I honestly feel like I just ate soggy cardboard. I will say though, in comparison to most other places, they give you a TON of shrimp...which would be completely awesome if it had tasted like anything.

Even the ahi poke dish was a disappointment with it's portion size. The pizzas, both that we ordered-tasted like it had no tomato/marinara sauce underneath the cheesy texture. The pasta was downright bland and had no flavor, possibly needed more seasoning. The clam chowder in the bread bowl? Nope. When it came out the bread seemed cold and every part of it was soggy. If it had just came out of the oven to be set out to eat, it's reasonable to say at least some parts of the bread would not come out soggy... it literally tasted like the entire bread bowl was soaked in water for an hour.

That's about it, really. I was excited when this place opened up, but was quite disappointed to discover that they do not brew their beer in the store, it is shipped from California or wherever. There's just something cool about a REAL brewhouse. This isn't really a brewhouse. It's a brewhouse's restaurant 1300 miles from the actual brewery. The house beers are alright, though. I like their heffewiezen. They also have a pretty good selection of the usual. I can get regular domestic or imported tap elsewhere though, so when I come here I get their house beers. I don't like the actual restaurant itself. It is entirely OPEN. No little nooks or crannies for you to lean back against and chill out in private. The store is all open and lots of completely empty space. It lacks ambiance. It lacks style and comfort. Maybe people out west like that. A bunch of non-offensive nothingness. The openness of the building is very uninviting to people who like to sit down to a nice cozy meal and a brew. Their menu LOOKS very appealing, but I've only ever had the fish and chips here because it is rather expensive. Out of the 3 times I've had their fish and chips, I was rather disappointed every time. The first time, the fish was just right, good portions and all that, but I was very turned off about those thin boring fries. Man.... screw those fries. You'd have to grab half a dozen of those dumb fries just to get a taste of potato. I was so turned off that I even left a complaint on their website. They called back and I spoke to a manager who said he was sorry that I didn't like their skinny fries, but they ""tested well"" across the country and he hoped I can get used to them. No. I won't get used to your skinny crap fries. They suck. Serve REAL fries. The other two times I got the fish and chips, the fish came out overcooked and barely any flavor. I probably won't go back there again for that. I might try something else like their cajun lasagna, though. That looked good. Their peperonni flatbread, however, is very on point, and leads me to believe that their pizza might be rockin. Speaking of rockin, you'll be rockin and rolling and slipping and sliding on those floors when you try to walk anywhere. They keep those floors so slick, it's almost as though they don't want anyone walking anywhere but to their table when they arrive and back out the door when they leave. WHAT IS THE DEAL WITH THOSE FLOORS?!? I wear two types of footwear, sandals and boots, and I SHIT YOU NOT, I COULD SLIDE ALL THE WAY TO THE BATHROOM. I swear to you, that I have done that, just to prove a point. You could have your friend literally PULL you without lifting your feet if you wanted. I don't think I'll go here very much in the future. Like I said, there is NO ambiance to this place. It's all very open and impersonal. The food I and others have had was mediocre at best. This place gets 2 stars instead of 1 ONLY because they serve their house beers that I can't get anywhere else and they're pretty good and to be honest, the service here is above average; at the bar and on the floor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-slidell?start=4089,Paul W.,"Memphis, TN",52,292,21,4,10/20/2015,"Good food and good service. åÊTasted my friend's fried artichokes -- they were simply OK. åÊMy fish and chips entree was excellent, although the fries were lukewarm. åÊNice atmosphere. åÊWill be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-slidell?start=4090,Kim V.,"Slidell, LA",0,10,,1,8/07/16,"Was in the start of Lunch , when we wanted to take my in-laws , ordered lunch and was the worse , Pizza app was very gross and service was very slow !!

Halfway through the burger, and my husband spit out a goopy pink shrimp. It was inside one of the jalapeÌ±o bites. Shrimp makes us both completely sick to our stomach, so meal ruined right there. That's not the big problem though. The problem is in their food prep; I cannot fathom how that shrimp got inside the jalapeÌ±o popper in the first place. Either they are storing their food terribly or just not paying attention at all during prep.

Tonight, four of us were dining. As usual, the greeters and all the staff are very nice and friendly. They're just sort of. . . scattered. Two of our party had arrived early and already had drinks. We remaining two ordered beers -- and the wait began. It really can't take 15 minutes to draw a beer, can it? Still, it was okay, because we were enjoying the conversation. Server came back with the beers and asked if we were ready to order. One lady in the party ordered and he then turned to the gentleman opposite here (we were at a 4-top) to take his order. He politely indicated that the server should take my order next (ladies first still applies in restaurant service, folks!). All apps and main courses ordered, we enjoyed our drinks and conversation -- for a long time. Oh, and when he left after taking our order, he did not pick up the menus. I know that's a small thing, but really, those menus are BIG and take up a lot of room. It was awkward to have them there. He came back at one point to bring us waters (we had to ask for those twice) and still didn't take the menus. We finally flagged down another server and asked him to take them away, which he did. Finally another server appeared with one salad. The other three apps were nowhere in sight. She set it down in front of the gentleman and left. We proceeded to wait some more. Had to have been at least five minutes before the other three apps arrived. Is it really that hard? Make the three hot apps and THEN make the salad and take it all out together. Hmmm... Apps happily consumed, we waited some more. Someone came by and took two of the four app plates away -- and disappeared. The other two were left on the table until our meals came out. Awkward #2. When our meals did arrive, one in our party discovered that her Thai Chicken Salad was missing the chicken. Hmm... Server came back to ask if all was well, and she pointed it out. To his credit, he immediately went to the kitchen and returned fairly promptly with a nice plate of sliced chicken for her salad. Seems whoever is doing quality control in the kitchen messed up on that one! At the end of the meal, two of us decided to share a Pizookie as we had never had one. The guys were too stuffed, so we got to enjoy it on our own. When the server took the order, he again took two plates away and left the remaining two, which weren't whisked off the table until the dessert arrived. BTW, the Pizookie is good, but splitting it was absolutely the right thing to do. Very rich! All in all, the food is very good -- probably no Michelin stars or anything, but better than most pub food. I perused the menu online so that helped -- the thing is huge! It could take a long time to decide what to order if you'd never seen it before.  Service and expediting and quality control have issues. Everyone is nice, which makes up for a lot, but the inconsistencies are glaring. There are lots of servers running around -- there were four clustered around a computer terminal for quite a while -- but they just don't seem very organized in how they do things. Does the main server bus tables, too? I don't know. If there are designated bus persons, they need to do a better job. If the server is supposed to do that, then some further training needs to happen. And timing and quality checks in the kitchen need to be addressed, too. It's just awkward to have one person get a salad and then stare at it and the other three dinner companions for five minutes or more before the rest of the appetizers arrive.

I went in for dinner with my boyfriend as we had done a few times there, customer service hasn't always been the best but this time it really ticked me off..after waiting forever during a slow mid week late evening we finally got out VERY weak margaritas (literally tasted like a virgin margarita..ick) I ordered the bacon cheese burger with fries and my boyfriend got the same. They didn't ask how I wanted it cooked like most places do and I didn't think to make sure to say well done (never had to before anywhere else) when I got my burger it was very very pink. Now if it was just a little pink I would have been fine but this was REALLY pink, his was not. So I had to send it back and get it cooked again. They didnt make a new burger or fries, they threw my cut in half burger on the grill and brought me back a soggy bun, cold fries, greasy plate. By this time my boyfriend was done eating as it had been around 20 min before I got my good back. So instead of sending it back AGAIN I ate some of it because I was frustrated, hungry and ready to go. I didn't ask for my money back (which I should have that night) but like I said, I was flustered and just wanted to go. So they next day I called to speak with a manager and tell him about my experience and ask for a compensated burger on my next visit. He basically made me feel like a liar and complainer, and told me I should have done something about it that night. I explained how I felt that night and how I just wanted to leave out of frustration. He still did nothing.

Trip number 2 was for appetizers, dinner, and beer (more on the beer later) while we watched the USC football game. åÊAs a hot wing fanatic I was immediately drawn to their EXXXXXXXXtra Hot wings. åÊWhen I asked the server about them he went on to say that they were pretty hot and if I didn't like spicy food I should stick to the traditional or BBQ style. åÊRight On!! åÊChallenge accepted! åÊ They must have gotten the order wrong because the wings I ate I would have had no problem serving to my 6 year old daughter. åÊOf all the adjectives I could use to describe them, ""hot"" isn't one of them. åÊThe wings themselves were fairly poor quality pieces and I think I left roughly half of them uneaten. åÊComing from a guy that has no problem packing away 20 plus wings during a football game, that's saying something. åÊOh yeah. åÊFootball. åÊThey didn't have the game on. åÊIn fact, they were unable to get ANY PAC-12 football games that weren't shown on national TV. åÊ An Oregon sports bar that doesn't get PAC-12 football. åÊGood thinking.

Also, despite this chain's propensity to receive innuendo filled comments, I will hold back for the time being.

Now, this shop purports to be a brewhouse and they easily stand up to the test with about a dozen and half of their own brews on tap. They also feature a respectable list of 'guest beers', so you'll have an easy time finding something that you like. I tried the Jeremiah Red and I'd get it again on my next visit if I weren't so intrigued about their other flavors. Three drinks in particular caught my eye: the Berry Burst Cider (not a brew), P.M. Porter (nitro), and the Tatonka Imperial Stout.  We also tried one of their famed Pizookies, a warm cookie topped with ice cream.

I have never been soooo disappointed in a restaurant in a great while, but BJ's Hillsboro takes the cake! We were there last night and I can honestly say it was THE WORST dining experience I've had in recent history. My husband and I arrived there at 6:55 and only had to wait to be seated for a couple of minutes. We were still waiting for 3 people so we didn't mind the wait. A waiter appeared appeared after 5 minutes and asked us for drinks and appetizers so we ordered a diet coke and the house brewed root beer with the lettuce wraps and calamari. This was around 7:05, the rest of our party came at around 7:20, none of our drinks nor the appetizers have made an appearance yet. We waited for the waiter to appear to take our friend's drink orders but he didn't approach our table until it was 7:30- 7:35 with mine and my husband's drinks, by that time we all knew what we wanted so we made our orders. My husband ordered the 12 oz. rib eye medium rare, I ordered the grilled pork chops, our friends ordered miso salmon, chicken salad and the BJ cheeseburger without pickles and tomatoes. The waiter took our order and then began the longest wait EVER!!! Our friends drinks came at around 8:00, but still no sign of our appetizers. The glass that the orange cream soda came in was filthy, we had to ask for another. Oh and the cutlery had sooo much spots that I was tempted to ask for replacement but we just wiped them with our serviettes. By 8:15 the appetizers finally came. By this time, the whole table were pretty much pissed off. It took an hour for the appetizers to come, I mean seriously did they have to catch the squid themselves??? By 830 our orders still have not come and when we asked the waiter what was taking so long he responded by saying that he too, was wondering why our table was still empty! Really??? We wanted to walk out already. My friend ordered a salad, how long does it take to make it? He came back a few minutes later with our orders, the 12 oz rib eye was supposed to be medium rare but it looked like it had been sitting on the warmer for too long as the steam veggies and rice looked like they've seen better days and the steak was definitely NOT medium rare, the mashed potato on my grilled pork chops was so dry and the knife was so hot like it was placed on a warmer. The chicken salad's lettuce were all WILTED like it was made first and then just left sitting out. The cheese burger had 5 pieces of pickles when it was specifically requested to be taken out. The miso salmon was still not there and the waiter said it was delivered to the wrong table. it was already 9pm at this time. We were seriously annoyed already and we were about to cancel his miso salmon when the manager came and said there had been a mix-up in the back and that the order will be comped because of the delay. Like it would cover up the fact that we have been there for two hours already! WORST service EVER!!!

We were seated by 7:15 amongst a row of small ""for two"" tables with one long communal booth seat and chairs on the aisle side. åÊOur first impression: We feel crammed in like sardines, and man, is it loud in here. åÊMy elbows on each side were perhaps eighteen inches from neighbors. åÊBeing not-terribly-into close crowds, we ALMOST left without eating but decided to stick it out. åÊ Thankfully, the ambient noise level was so loud that with the exception of a highly curious 10 year old just off my left shoulder most of our conversation remained private. åÊBut I could still easily make out most of the conversations of the two neighboring guests. åÊEventually the 10 year old and her family vacated, only to be replaced with a 6 year old who insisted on bouncing on the (one very long) booth seat while playing his pocket-sized video game console. Wife N. started with a salad wedge, a quarter head of iceberg lettuce with a substantial helping of blue cheese dressing and crumbles, bacon, and (normally) åÊtomatoes and onions which she opted against. åÊFrankly it was pretty good--I mean good for an otherwise nondescript wedge of iceberg. åÊThe bacon was mapl-y sweet and married quite well with the tang of the bleu cheese and dressing. åÊHonestly, really good as far as wedge salads go. I ordered the Chicken Marsala and Wife N. ordered the French Dip. åÊAlong with the meal, we ordered an 8-beer sampler (eight 5-oz pours). åÊYou can pick from a selection of about 11 brews and a berry-apple cider. About 15 minutes later, the meal arrived. åÊBeer was nowhere in sight. åÊIt arrived about 5 minutes after the food. åÊOkay, no big deal. åÊ The food was quite good. åÊThe chicken was ""food safety police"" done (which I maintain is about 10-15 degrees more cooked than necessary) but it still was tender, flavorful and relatively juicy. åÊThe sauce was as good as we make at home. åÊThe chicken was accompanied by mushrooms, steamed green beans and served atop fettuccini pasta. åÊThe veggies were hot, but still crisp. åÊNicely done. åÊThe French Dip was very flavorful--the beef was tasty and the garlicky bread it was served on gave it a lovely kick. åÊOn the side was creamy horseradish which Wife N doesn't eat but I gladly applied to the bite or two I consumed. The beers were honestly a nice surprise. åÊI realize BJ's is a pretty big ""chain"", but for a chain, their beers were pretty good. åÊTheir ruby-tinged cider had a berry twist to it and for those that like lighter-alcohol fizzy drinks on the sweeter side, this one was VERY nice. åÊTheir hefeweizen had an oddly-floral nose to it that initially was a bit weird but we wound up liking it by the second sip. åÊOther beers we tried included their Porter, their Stout, a Red, and a Nut Brown. åÊAll were pretty good--some were better than competitors'. åÊ This restaurant has been open around a month. åÊSo it's understandable that the service is still a little scattered. åÊOn the whole, I'd say ""A-Ok"". åÊIf it was just about the food and price/value, I'd be saying 4*s. åÊBut the service was 3*s, and with getting crammed in like a sardine, 2*s, we have an averaged 3*'s rating, good enough to return in perhaps a month or two once they get the kinks ironed out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-hillsboro?start=220248,Dan Karen D.,"Hillsboro, OR",1,36,12,3,3/31/2013,"I have been to BJs twice now.

The reason I couldn't give 5 stars is because of the slow service every time I've been there. It hasn't been a problem as I've always been stating over close by and when on the road and having dinner I'm not usually in a hurry but if I were under a time constraint the slow service could definitely be a problem.

The cheese pizza and chicken wraps were phenomenal. Way better than we were expecting (then again we're not hard to please). The steak on the other hand was bad. No seasoning, no flavor. It seems they just unwrapped the meat and cooked it plain, and the same goes for the veggies that came with it. Not a big deal, but if you're going to charge $15 I would hope you do something a little bit beyond letting it sit on the grill for a few minutes. Maybe some salt? I dunno. You're better off getting an awesome pizza for the price. The prices are actually pretty good for a place like this. $30 for the steak, chicken wraps, and a meal for the kid.

And for many reasons. The main, of which as far as I can tell is there is a HUGE issue with the local restaurant management as far as:  1: There is just not enough servers and WAY too many hosts during lunch and dinner hour.  And for the love of all that is Holy, HIRE SOME DAMN BUSSERS!  Seriously; as it is I can see your servers sweat, pant, and hustle trying to serve a half full house with only less than a third if the amount of employees on floor needed to efficiently serve all of them, before every one walking in is waiting on not only to be seated, but also waiting 25-30 minutes for a drink because your server is trying to clean up the table and has not even had the time to write down your order yet!  Stop being a bunch of cheap asshole capitalists and take responsibility, HIRE BUSSERS!  2: Morale in general with every employee is so low you can drag your tits on it. ( I wish I were joking ) EVERYONE, is working so damn hard and clearly no one gets recognized for shit. I have been there, I can see it. I would never work for your company. It is clear that pure profit is the only thing that matters. Service to your patrons and proper management to your employees is a clear waste of time.  3: The Chefs in the back give zero fucks about their jobs. All the food is either overcooked, raw in the middle, or they mess up the entire ticket. No matter what something is always wrong! And it will take 25-30 minutes to get it fixed, only to have it overcooked and dry as hell, or bland and still raw.  This is a HUGE SLAP IN THE FACE OF THE CUSTOMER. Is BJs supposed to be a restaurant and brew house superior to most here in Fresno? Is it not supposed to have at least an inkling of decent standards? Maybe even, supposed to be considered swank, high quality, and an experience to remember?  Your cuisine ( if it can even be called that because your cooks and Chefs can't even cook on a DENNYS scale.) is priced at anywhere from $9.99 to $25.00 per entre! Why would my husband $15.99  bison burger come out burnt!? McDonalds would have been better!  So WHY, pray tell; would I rate you even a 2 stars?  Well, because not only do I submit my review and experiences here on YELP. But lucky for you guys, my husband happens to know the management running the regional BJs. And in response to our last submission we spoke at length with Dustin from the BJs corporate office and in deep regret with the awful experiences we have been receiving from our ONLY local BJs brewery we received a $25.00 gift card and a Free Pizookie coupon as an apology.

It's a chain restaurant, but as we all know...some are better than others and some others, well they plain suck, so it's always good to know which ones to avoid, right? Right. This was a visit to the Fresno location near Fashion Fair Mall. We usually avoid the location like the plague only due to the crowds and well...we're not really fans of people, in general so we try to avoid them at all costs.  We came on a weekday around 2pm, pretty steady inside, not a ghostown and that was all good - BUT....my god, the fact that they seat full-grown-full-size adults into those tiny little wall tables for two(when there were PLENTY of regular-sized tables available) - pretty much will fit a 95lb girl-child and her millenial bf who pretty much counts on his beard to make up for his barely 160lb frame while wearing skinny jeans and flaunting a man-bun. Yeah THAT ain't my Hubs. He pretty much gets called ""Stone Cold"" and mistaken for Steve Austin almost every day, which cracks me up, but it is uncanny - THAT being said...he's a big dude and likes his elbow space. I'm 5'10"" and every time set us in these tiny little seating areas...Hubs needs his elbow room and there just AIN'T any of that in those tiny little 2-person booths. We usually have to request to be seated elsewhere due to that, but Hubs was just annoyed already (yeah, I was too, hell yeah - HATE IT but get tired of having to f@#$ing ask every single damn time!). So we sit in the magical tiny seating booth and start to look at the menu - it was mid-day so I was going for lite (and I had to keep my purse on my lop as there was NO where to put it - and I don't put my bags on the floor, no thank you) - I ended up just getting an order a fries as I LOVE LOVE LOVE those skinny tiny crispy little shoestring fries and love they give you a big basket of them...and Hubs had the chopped bbq chicken salad (whch is ALWAYS good) - everything came quickly and the salad was beautiful and Hubs was stoked.  And then.....I saw the fries. Wha????? Wait....The fries were NO LONGER......the tiny skinny crispy fries - they've changed them up. Oh yay - the ONE thing I wanted and they managed to screw that up. Plus, they brought about a handful in an order. Needless to say....completely disheartened and irritated beyond explanation - those fries were the cornerstone of many a sandwich. And those fries MADE the perfect companion to those sliders. These were frozen (despite the effort to seem not frozen) and barely fried. Delivered lukewarm (odd since there wasn't any wait for the food, really, as it wasn't busy or crowded). There was a complete lack of crispness to them...so yeah, I didn't even finish them as it was just lukewarm pasty-blech. I did let our server know how disappointing it was...but she said it was a change they made recently - not really with a reason, that she was aware of anyway. Horrible decision and honestly - one of the things I say to Hubs on a fairly regular basis ""babe, I'm in the mood for some GOOD fries...where should we go?"" - yeah BJ's is now permanently OFF that list. I won't even bother ordering fries there at this point. They were awful - and exactly like just about every chain restaurant.

The lighting makes it easy to read the menus without having to strain while also maintaining a level of dimness that makes it seem more cozy than it really is.  The service at Bjs is in-line with the ambiance. Although I have never had a bad experience, I have never really had an amazing one either. Aside from the fact that some of the waiters are really easy on the eyes, most of them seem like they are working their way through college. Obviously that is perfectly acceptable, but sometimes it can be problematic when they seem a bit distracted while ordering. As I said, no one has been too bad, just never that exceptional service that you hope for. The menu itself is a mishmash of Asian-fusion, Italian, American, and a few other things. I can honestly say that most of the entrees and appetizers are ok. They don't blow me away, but they also aren't bad. I never find myself ordering the same thing twice because of how good it was. Except perhaps the broccoli cheese soup. They only serve it certain days, and it is worth ordering.  Two items that they are known for are their pizzas, and their burgers. The burgers are, again, ok. They have big patties, and lots of different topping options. I have not had one in awhile due to being a vegetarian, but I can't remember ever feeling disappointed with a burger. The pizza, on the other hand, is very hit or miss. Served deep-dish style, the pizzas are offered in a variety of overwhelming flavors. BBQ chicken, the Great White... the list is long, but overall is entirely underwhelming. I can say that I haven't really had a pizza I liked at Bjs. They don't provide that ump you expect of good pizza, which leaves me craving some nice cheesy sauce pizza from some other local pizza shop.  Finally, the reason I keep going back to Bjs, they have desserts. The Pizookie (pizza cookie) is perhaps the most famous item on their menu. A fresh, hot, thick, gooey cookie topped with some creamy vanilla ice cream, how could that be bad? I would suggest sticking with the classic flavors. Chocolate chip, peanut butter, or white chocolate macadamia are all winners. I have also had the Oreo, the Red Velvet, and the Ghirardelli double chocolate, all of which left me wishing I had ordered one of the originals.  All in all Bjs is a great little chain. Before I gave up drinking I could always rely on their bartenders to provide a tasty cocktail, they have entrees that are worthy of your 12 bucks, and the desserts are all bomb. If they weren't so much like every other chain they would be worth four stars, but there's just nothing unique about Bjs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fresno?start=8052,Jovana A.,"El Paso, TX",67,4,,4,4/23/2016,Went there last night around 8ish the atmosphere was nice..

Pizzas is what draws me to BJ's, åÊtheir pizza is delicious and satisfactory if you fancy the thick (but not Chicago style thick) åÊfluffy soft dough pizza category with generous toppings.The pizza is not cheap for $24++ (LARGE), but come here for quality because they have it - their Spicy Hawaiian is my favorite and I highly recommend it if its your first time here. Their large sized pizza is great to be shared among 3-4 people through my experience, because its thick and fluffy, and generously pilled with chicken, pineapple, bacon, jalapeÌ±o, and tomatoes. I normally like to order online and I would highly suggest it because it is really easy, you can schedule a time and you pay as you pick it up. They have a curbside parking, and all I had to do it give them a call which is posted on their curbside sign and they will be there to get payments and also deliver the food. Plus you don't have to tip so that cuts the cost for students like me.  Their pizza is luscious. Let me start with the dough, the texture of the dough is very thick and yet soft and springy as you bite in, almost like a pillow texture.The taste of the crust reminds me of the once upon a time when pizza hut use to be good, it has a very addictive and palatable taste to it, and its very stable that you pizza slice does not fall apart as you hold it. Alongside, the topping were very generous, and i carefully use the word generous, because this place had piles of its promised toppings on my pizza. So you could imagine the grilled chicken, jalapeÌ±o, tomatoes, bacon and pineapple for my Spicy Hawaiian pizza was so much that I was satisfied. To add to that, they use real and fresh ingredients, no fake meat or fake canned vegas were detected, the roasted chicken looked and tasted like one.  My sister also ordered the angel hair Classico pasta, and I must say it was pretty spot on, the pasta was al dente and the flavors was very delightful and had a lot of depth for something so simple.

The Positives: The food here is great and if its not a busy night than go here and get a table. They brew there own Root Beer which tastes Great! The pizza is fantastic. The 2 person booths are a nice size not to small or to big.  The reason for the 1 star and not more is simply because I don't like restaurants that will not tell me how long I will have to wait once I get there. Also Not taking reservations on Valentines Day. I can see not taking them on regular days, but when you don't take them on valentines day your only going to piss off a lot of people who are waiting in the cold outside for over a hour, eventually they might leave for another place.

We came in and had a bit of a wait, 25 minutes was quoted but I'm sure we didn't wait that long. While we were waiting large groups of Cal Fire battalions were coming in and out, I'm positive they fed over 100 fire fighters this evening. We were seated and waited on promptly.

Our service was impeccable! Our server was attentive, sweet to my child, and had an overall positive demeanor. Just Excellent!  The food. I've always liked the food here but I think the good service made it taste that much better. We started with a calamari appetizer that was crisp, hot and included two delicious dipping sauces. My husband ordered a tavern pizza, he said it was flavorful, cooked well, and the meats were good quality. The presentation was nice, it is served on a pizza skid/plank and looks great. I ordered a mini chicken bacon ranch pizza. It was the perfect size just for me. The deep dish is irresistible savory, crisp crust and chewy center cooked through. The chicken and bacon were the real deal, I could actually taste lean white meat chicken and real bacon, no bacon bits. The red onion was sliced thin, well distributed, and complimentary. The ranch drizzle was tangy and delicious. The pizza was great! My daughter had Mac and Cheese with a fruit cup. I am so thankful that the food came out on a cool plate, at a temperature appropriate for a child. She was able to eat right away and was a happy camper. A happy toddler makes a happy mommy!

We walked in and was greeted by the hostess. We asked for a table. She said there was about a 10 minute wait. I seen that there was 2 open chairs at the bar, so I told her we would be sitting at the bar. She said OK. I did notice there was those little pagers on the hostess stand, but she didn't offer us one. So we sat at the bar and ordered a few cocktails and enjoyed the very large flat screen while we waited. I enjoyed a Abbey Ale beer on the very friendly bartenders recommendation. Great beer and only 4 bucks. After about 15 minutes, i figured I would go to the hostess station and see what was happening. She says and I quote "" Oh, there you are Mike. I have been calling ur name for a few minutes. I gave your table away, I will have one for you shortly."" I said, "" you knew I was at the bar!"" She said she was sorry and would seat me as soon as possible. So, back to the bar for another great beer. After another 15 minutes, I returned to the hostess station. A different gal was there, and she said, ""I don't see you name on the list"". I started to explain what happened and then the other gal returned and seated us right away.

Just sayin!!! After we were seated our waitress came and greeted us. She was very friendly and answered our questions about the menu items we were interested in. So we decided to order the- Calamari App BBQ full rack  Double deluxe burger The calamari came, and some pieces were cruncy and tasty and some of the pieces were soggy and terrible. How does that happen. Did they fry two batches and give it to us???? WTF?? The two dippin sauces were just average. Our salads came and they were fresh and tasty. I really like the croutons. They were great! Our dinner came, and I must say the burger and fries were VERY GOOD!! The patty's were cooked to med rare as I asked. They had a nice char on the outside and some pink in the middle. Very tasty burger!!! Now to the ribs. I must say that my better half is spoiled when it comes to BBQ. Not to blow my own horn, but I've been smoking meat for a long time and I can put out some awful good BBQ. The ribs were tender and juicy, but lacked a good spice rub. So the meat was somewhat bland. I can swear that I've tasted their BBQ sauce before and I've never eatin here before. So it kind of reminds me of one of those sauces in a bottle. But I could be wrong.

We asked for a few minutes, and she was generous to give us a few more than that. åÊNo worries though--especially since we were not in a rush. We ordered the pot stickers as an appetizer... It's been a while since I've been here...looks like they've gone through another menu pricing increase. I was surprised to find that six pot stickers now cost just shy of $10. åÊOh well, a sign of the times, right? åÊI ordered soup and salad for my meal, and my hot date ordered a pizza. A few minutes later, two servers came out with my soup and salad.. When I informed them this was my entree and we were still waiting for our appetizer, they were a bit confused and seemed to want me to take my meal while my husband waited for his. åÊAfter an awkward pause, they agreed to take the meal back to the kitchen and bring it out after the appetizer and when my husband's meal was also ready. åÊBecause I had made a few special requests for the salad, I asked them to just keep my salad chilled--no reason to toss a perfectly good salad due to timing issues. The rest of the meal was flawless. The pot stickers were nicely browned on one side, and very flavorful, my chicken tortilla soup was delicious with just the right amount of spice, and my salad was exactly how I had asked for it. åÊOur waitress was prompt in refilling beverages, and overall, it was a very nice meal. By the time we left, the place was busy with the standard Saturday lunch rush...and our quality of service did not suffer even with the busier dining room. In all, I don't mind if there are mistakes made at a restaurant--we're all human. What matters to me is how they are handled. The servers did not make me feel bad for requesting my appetizer first, and they were more than courteous and prompt...and of course--it helped that the food was quite delicious!

Though I think most people will let it slide. Food Quantity/Quality: The food quality is very good. One of my most important criteria is that I don't get sick because of the food. I haven't gotten sick! I ordered a deep dish pizza with Italian meats, and it was pretty good. My one complaint is that it was poorly sliced and hard to get out of the pan, but given how busy they were, it was Fresno States Graduation night, it's not that big of a problem. I enjoyed every single bite, and I liked how the pizza was more toppings than sauce. I hate my pizza to be 60% tomato sauce, and this pizza avoided that pitfall.  Service: When I got there the place was PACKED. It was Fresno States Graduation night, and was logically going to be full given that Fresno State isn't that far away. It also happens that their location puts them right across from Mall, so they're usually busy anyway. I was told that it would be a 25 minute wait for a table for two, but ended up being more like 10. I was taken to the table, which was just being cleared off and cleaned, but given the sheer number of people I'm more than willing to let it go. The drink orders were taken immediately, and arrived much faster than I had anticipated. Our main orders were taken, and the food arrived within 25 minutes. That's really good considering that every table in the building was full. Our waiter was attentive, even though he was waiting at least 10 different tables, and apologized profusely if he thought he was neglecting my table. Seriously though the only time was when I waited a hot minute for a water refill, but he handled it.  I've never had a bad experience at BJ's, and it certainly doesn't look like I ever will.

They were promoting watching the game there, though, and everyone knows that's a 3 hour ordeal so we decided to give it another try. Bad idea!! This visit was even worse than the last! I got off work late so my hubby sat in the bar, ordered an appetizer and politely waited for me. He later placed our pizza order with a comment that I wasn't there yet but I should be there before the food comes out. Not 2 minutes later, a server drops the salads off to my bewildered husband. 15 minutes later, the pizza comes out to a table with 2 untouched salads on it! How utterly and completely rude! At least the server noticed that faux pas and had the pizza immediately taken back (but they later delivered the exact same pizza to us). So I show up after a stressful day at work ready to relax and watch the game but am immediately greeted by a salad that is in the way of me enjoying the half of the appetizer that my hubby kindly left for me. So I move the salad, eat the appetizer, eat the salad and then they bring out the exact same pizza which is now lukewarm and dry. Why they didn't just re-make the pizza baffles me. It had been waiting at least 30 minutes - don't they have health rules about how long cooked food can sit? So after one slice of this lukewarm nonsense I push my plate away in disgust. The server immediately comes over to pick up my plate, get our pazookie order (which I refuse to give her) and leaves with ""I'll bring you a box"". A BOX!?! My husband is still eating! So she brings us the box and asks about the pazookie choice AGAIN and my husband and I say ""No we haven't decided yet!"" in perfect irritated unison. BTW, it's not even halftime yet...  So we continue to refuse to give our pazookie order until the 4th quarter starts and then we don't receive it until the 2 minute warning and it's barely warm.

BJs is food, but it's not great. I keep going back, so they must be doing something right. I think the problem and the reason are one in the same: they make a lot of mistakes, but the managers are very willing to make the necessary corrections to make the customer somewhat happy. My problem is there's always a mistake. And the biggest mistake they make is serving you cold, inconsistent food. I always order the same two dishes and it's almost exact when I say, every other visit, my food is good. Just like the other day when I ordered the Ahi Poke appetizer. They forgot to marinade the Ahi in their poke sauce. They basically served me raw, bland tuna. I finally realized what the problem was and the waitress brought me some poke sauce, but never offered an apology or an option of getting another Ahi Poke made correctly. Nope.

I want to be able to digest for a second between courses. Also, besides this one waiter I've had there (dirty blonde, wavy-ish hair?), the servers I've had have been so.. forgettable. Not that they're terrible servers or anything, but they're just not going out of their way to be good servers. Very technical--take the order, walk away, bring food, walk away.. no personality. And I've even had one waitress who was borderline RUDE the entire time she was taking our party. Yes, we had 20 people in our party, and yes, we all were in our early 20's, but HELLO, we have a large party, which means you're getting gratuity.

She had patience with everyone as we ordered, asked for additional condiments during the meal, and she frequently checked-in on us - all during a very busy night. The most impressive thing was this: I asked her for a group picture and I have never seen anyone go above and beyond to make this happen. She was a fairly small girl and needed a boost to fit everyone in the frame. A co-worker of hers brought her a small stool and she made it happen!

After scouring the huge menu, I decided on the shrimp and asparagus penne and my hubby ordered a mini pizza. Our server mentioned that large pizzas were half off on Monday, so we went with a large. Mike's rewards card was acting up and so the waitress said a manager was coming to talk to us about it. The food came. The pizza was huge, cheesy and delicious! However, my pasta was VERY Al Dente.

The Hickory Brisket Burger was my entree of choice tonite, it comes with a lean burger cooked to order smothered with sweet and tangy barbecue sauce, hickory smoked bacon, red onion, amd chedder-jack cheese.

I have a really bad habit of going to restaurants and ordering the same thing every single time but when it comes to BJ's, the entire menu looks delicious so it's one of the only places I venture out of my comfort zone and I'm never disappointed.  My parents and I go here every time they're in town, we always pick BJ's to have dinner. We typically start out with the calamari or the avocado egg rolls. (My mom does their rewards program and we got our appetizer for free on our last visit!!) My parents normally go for steak or fish and I normally try something different every other visit. Especially now that they expanded their menu! After going multiple times my top pick for the appetizer is the avocado egg rolls hands down. The dipping sauce they provide is amazing and its a good portion to share between the three of us. My top three choices for entrees is the California Club Flatbread Pizza, Seared Ahi Salad and the Roasted Salmon Quinoa Bowl. åÊ Lastly, one of the best parts about going to Bj's...their famous pizookie. A delicious warm cookie topped with ice cream. I believe they have a mini size (free on birthdays), a regular size, or the option to do a pizookie ""pizza"" with a couple different flavors. I'm almost positive I've tried all the flavors over the years and once again, never disappointed. The triple chocolate is amazing as well as the red velvet and the pumpkin flavor (might be seasonal). åÊ  When it comes to the staff, I've always had very polite waiters/waitresses, the employees up front lack professionalism but regardless, I come for the food and with more choices on the menu than ever, I'm excited to continue going back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sparks?start=100112,Jessica R.,"Sparks, NV",253,381,401,5,1/22/2015,"I must say the couple of times I went I really enjoyed my food.

It was like baked cookies with ice cream on top. We were able to choose our own flavor. I highly recommend getting the Pizookie.  As for the children's food, my son ordered mac & cheese. It wasn't that great; of course, it's stated it was from the kraft mac & cheese box. When trying it it tasted like it's been sitting for a while and has been warmed up. He did receive :-) potatoes to go with his meal. They were not like a usual potato (wedge).  As for the service, our waiter was very nice and respectful.

I can say a few years ago BJ's, it seemed, had given up and were definitely in a full on downhill coast to monotony. More recently they have made drastic improvements and it is a welcome change.  The beer has always been very good so if you are into the microbrews, enjoy; now you can also return for the food. On this occasion, for my first time, I had one of the deep dish pizzas. Ermergersh! It was really really good. The Mediterranean Pizza had most of what you'd expect: chicken, basil pesto, feta cheese, and obviously a crust. What wasn't so obvious was the sliced pepperoncinis, the kalamata olives, and the roasted garlic. I must admit the garlic had the more subtle note but likely because I've fried my taste buds years ago with garlic: I mean to say I never met a garlic anything I didn't like, and moreover have literally spent days being told how badly I stink because of the garlic [fill in the blank] that I ate somewhere. The nice twist for me was that, as is the norm in pizza, they didn't make a point of leaving a huge crusty edge, but instead monopolized on every inch of real estate available and topped all of it with ingredients. Don't get me wrong the crust was really good and I do like my pizza crusts but it's also about the toppings and this was a delicious blend of ingredients.  I nearly forgot to mention this but even some of the appetizers are fun and a nice tweak. Who doesn't love a Frito boat? Well they've revamped the Frito boat with Frito nachos and it is appealing and yummy on that sophomoric (I'd like the captain crunch, please) level. I could only gripe slightly about consistency, as location seems to play a significant role in how the appetizer turns out; they're still pretty derned good.

The deep dish lasagna wasn't very good last time I had it. It was cold in the middle and had a weird taste.  The last time I had ribs... I think those were the meatless ribs I've ever had.  The only reason I come here is because it's close home, their drinks are great! My favorite is the famous watermelon mojito. That drink is a bomb!! I love it!! I also come here a lot because of their pizzokie.

I've been to other BJs locations, but never this one. Honestly, I'm usually not a fan of chains like this, but I've never had a bad experience at any location I've been to and I've never had a bad meal. It's not my first choice, but in situations like this, I don't have any problem eating there. One thing I didn't know that they did was offer guest brews on their taps. So, there happened to be a beer brewed by Great Basin on tap, in addition to some California brewers, along with BJs beers. I thought that was pretty cool.  On this most recent visit, I decided to stay a little healthy and not order a gigantic hamburger. The Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos called my name, and even the side of grain salad sounded great too. Of course we ruined any health benefits of that by ordering the southwest egg rolls (seriously, I love these things and I love the chipotle dip that comes with them - such a guilty pleasure). The tacos were nicely stuffed, they didn't really skimp on anything and there was plenty of sauce to add to both of them. I loved all of the flavors and would definitely get it again. The disappointing part was the side salad. Kind of lacking in flavor and majorly lacking in portion. I think they gave me *maybe* a å_ cup. I could see the bottom of the dish, like it was kind of just smeared around to appear like I had more? I don't know. I made up for lack of grain salad by stealing the addicting shoe string fries off my boyfriend's plate. Service was quick and were didn't feel rushed out of there.

So a bad salad is like gas station coffee.  -That's also cold.  -That also has chunks of the grind floatin' around in there.  -That's also had a throat lozenge dissolve in the carafe.  So yeah, my salad was like that.  And it wasn't so much that the Cobb salad I ordered came with soggy ham. It's not so much that I care to think about how ham becomes soggy (not moist, mind you. Soggy. Picture Wonderbread in a puddle). åÊIt's not even the fact that the tomatoes may as well have been red-colored tasteless jello bits. Or that they must've ran down to the just-closing Port of Subs for their bottom-of-the-pan lettuce trimmings/emptied shredder tray. Or that on top of all this tasteless wonderment, they drizzled a nice little wisp of still-tasteless dressing; enough to cover the one bite that I should've just stuck with. Or that this entire bowl of ""meh"" was hacked with a weed wacker til it resembled a rice pilaf. No, none of this is what really set me over the edge, my friends. It's the fact that I was already so hungry, and we were already running late for a movie, that I just ate the damn thing.

My other problem(s) is, now correct me if I am wrong here, but when you think happy hour you think select appetizers at a reasonable discount, right? The thing that bothers me most is their so called ""Happy Hour prices"", they are completely deceptive as it's not any cheaper because they make their Happy Hour appetizers half the size(not in their menu anywhere does it say half the normal order) of what they would normally be, hence your still paying full price, see for yourself the next time you are there. Chicken wings for example; you get ten wings off happy hour and five (which in itself is slightly insulting) during their so called ""Happy Hour"", Pot Stickers aren't quite half the order but still slightly insulting when you see the quantity (4), and lastly, their craft beers are a dollar off putting them at four dollars each, not that great of a ""Happy Hour"" price either in my opinion. I'm not looking to get anything for free and as I said their food is good, but when you order five wings for five dollars, four pot stickers for five dollars, two beers at four dollars each, and my wife had some fancy drink that was $9.75 (Strawberry Splash I believe it was) granted it tasted good, but come on! $10 for a drink is a bit expensive/out of line! Our bill came to $28 and change for everything not including the tip, that didn't feel like Happy Hour at all to me, or my wallet. So if you're looking for ""Happy Hour"" prices at BJ's Brewhouse, you'll have to look elsewhere because you won't find it there. Again, the food is good, but 5 wings, 4 pot stickers, and 3 drinks for $28 (tip not included) is really hard to swallow. I would only give them 2 1/2 stars if possible and only completely because of their pricing, look, wings and pot stickers are/is some of the cheapest bar foods you can buy, and honestly, the don't differ very much from place to place.

Which I think is such an incredible deal. You get to choose a soup or salad to start, a medium pizza and a pizookie to share!  åÊ I started out with the Chicken Tortilla soup which I love. The flavors of the tortilla strips, huge slices of avocado, cheeses, chicken, and a slice of lime all blend so well together. I just wish that tonight the soup had a little more chicken then what it came with tonight. However, still very yummy. The deep dish pizzas we had were outstanding as always. My two favorite are the Mediterranean and the Buffalo Chicken! BJ's never fails to stuff so many flavorful toppings on their pizzas! The Mediterranean was so fresh tasted so incredible with the grilled chicken, basil pesto, roasted garlic, Kalamata olives, sun-dried tomatoes, feta cheese and sliced peperoncinis. Oh my goodness so good! The Buffalo Chicken had diced celery, red onions and grilled chicken breast marinated in a spicy buffalo sauce drizzled with ranch dressing and buffalo sauce.

Let be begin by saying that I overall I love BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse. I have eaten at BJ's all over the west coast and I normally leave very happy after drinking good beer, eating good food, and receiving excellent customer service. The review that I am writing today is in no way is reflective of BJ's as a whole; this review is only for its location in Sparks Nevada. On Saturday September 22, 2012 I decided to meet family for dinner. We chose to go to BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse at the Legends in Sparks Nevada. We arrived shortly before 4pm and sat down at a dirty table in the bar area. It took several minutes for a waitress to notice us and come to collect the check and dirty glasses from the previous patrons. At 4:04pm we ordered an appetizer, nachos and beer, we asked our waitress ""Dee"" about happy hour. She replied that ""we don't have happy hour on Saturday."" I pointed to the sign on the table that stated happy hour during all college and professional football games and motioned to the two games that were currently displayed on the huge TV above the bar. Our waitress replied with ""I have no idea what's going on"" and left to put our order in. At 4:07pm I could see our beers had been poured by the bartender and were sitting on the bar waiting for our waitress to come run them. There we sat until 4:21pm when our waitress brought water out to our table told us that is was in fact happy hour and asked if we were ready to order, we asked about the beer we ordered that we could see sitting on the counter getting flat for the last 14 minutes and our appetizer. She replied ""I can't run them right now; I was hoping someone else would have."" She walked around for a minute and then went to get our beer. At 4:24pm our beer was finally delivered to the table and she took our order for dinner. Someone from the kitchen came out with our nachos at 4:27pm, there was not silverware on the table and we were hungry so we just went and got them ourselves to avoid any further problems. At 4:30pm our waitress came to check on us, I ordered a second beer. I could see my beer get poured and was sitting on the bar at 4:33pm once again it just sat there until another server decided to bring it to the table at 4:46pm. The food finally arrived at 4:51pm, the food was good however my sandwich was served with far fewer fries than are normally served with meals and the plates were lacking the normal presentation I have come to expect from BJ's. It took over 20 minutes from the time we sat down to get a beer, at a Brewhouse I find highly unacceptable. The restaurant and bar had a typical Saturday crowd, it was by no means busy, and the restaurant looked adequately staffed. I would have voiced my complaints to a manager but there was no manager in sight most of the time we were there. As a frequent BJ's customer I have become accustomed to having a manager come by at least once during the meal to check on me. This did not occur, the only time I saw a manager during our visit was when two people who appeared to be managers came out from the back to stand behind the registers chatting with employees and divvying out tips in with the other staff in front of customers (See attached photos). I find 5 people standing behind a register while my beer is sitting on the bar getting warm and flat appalling. I would not write a review after one bad experience but a situation similar to this occurred about a month before when I had lunch at this location. I feel this location is lacking sound management and the restaurant as a whole is suffering. Poor employee education, training and the lack of management support and oversight lead to poor customer service and upset customers as a result. Luckily for BJ's I have had the pleasure of eating at other locations where I have become accustomed to enjoying great beer food and customer service at other locations.

I am so sad to have to leave this review as I have prided myself in only praising incredible acts of service.. But..Here it goes.. We have tried this location for date nights before and were not impressed due to like warm or overly salty food.. But as a fan we decided to try it a fourth time.. Today our åÊparty called at 4:00 to reserve a table of 16 people (4 of which were toddlers) for 5:30. My 25 month old and I arrived at 5:20 to which I was told ""we are preparing your table, as soon as 8 of your party members Arrive we will seat you."" The rest of our party arrived at 5:30-5:35. Our party host went to check us in and they said they would seat us shortly. By 6:00 we check in and are told it would be roughly 20 minutes...which would mean an hour after our reservation. At this point all of our toddlers had run laps outside of their facility several times, and were an hour past their meal times. We decided to call a near by restaurant and they were able to get us in right away. Right when we handed in our pager around 6:10 we were told ""half of our table is ready if you'd like to sit down"".Which needless to say made us feel incredibly under valued. This was our first time ever leaving a Bjs, and as a result we spent over 400 dollars at a neighboring restaurant. Half of our party lives in sparks which caused us give this location a try, unfortunately/or fortunately our weekly gatherings will have to be held back at the south reno location. Bottom line: There is a near by Bjs that prides themselves with impeccable customer service 20 minutes away. They often offer samples to those waiting, etc.. Look up ""Reno Bjs"".

Apparently, the favorite for the local medical group for entertaining guests because of the GIANT SELECTION. Honestly, this menu was twice as large as any other BJ's I've been to. Setting: Situated in the Sparks shopping mall, this restaurant is ideally located for the hungry shopper. There is bountiful parking with multiple entrances and exits. The general feel of the restaurant is similar to that of other BJ breweries. The main difference is the abundance of televisions plastered along every wall. The only drawback is that every single one was showing the same game. What if you didn't like football? Stinks for you cause that's what you're watching. Tables are appropriately spaced such that traffic is never impeded, even at full capacity. We went on a Monday night, very low traffic. Waiter: Energetic and friendly with a generally happy disposition. I'm not sure all waiters do this but he was very systematic regarding taking orders. A refreshing change from the several occasions where I've had to repeat my order several times. He was quick with our refills. Given that we had a relatively large party, I appreciated the fact that he updated us with the status on our food several times. Definitely one of the pluses of this particular outing. Food: Ordered the BBQ chicken pizza. As always, cooked to perfection. The crust was slightly buttered and crispy, the perfect combination for pizza. The deep dish pizza was indeed, thick, possibly measuring about 1 inch in depth. BBQ roasted to the point where it was slightly spicy. They may have skimped on the tomatoes a little bit. Lucky for me, they compensated with chicken. PROTEIN!!! Didn't get the desert but the pizooky is highly recommended. Drinks: Diet coke. 3 refills in 1 hour. Not sure if I got my money's worth.

I'd give this restaurant 10 stars if I could! They have excellent food at very reasonable prices, with A+ service. Some MUST TRY menu items are: Avacado Egg Rolls, Balsamic Chicken, Glazed Salmon, Berry Delicious (an alcoholic beverage), and of course their famous warm Pizookie (personally, I like Oreo the best). You really can't beat their prices for the quality of food. Everything is fresh, hot, and comes in large portions. I've visited their Sparks Legend's location 5 times, and their original Summit Location in Reno more than 15 times. Both locations have equally great food and service. One thing I refuse to deal with at restaurants is rude or snobby staff members - and I've never met one at either BJs. They go above and beyond, making sure you're satisfied with your order & that your drinks are full. Their full bar is quite impressive! It reaches the ceiling and is stocked to the max with just about every alcohol imaginable.  I saw that one person complained about their billing system - and yes, if there was one tiny thing I'd complain about, it is that. A couple of times, we've been given the bill before our meal was even finished. We would then need to add dessert ... and the waiter would re-tally the bill. Then we ordered some drinks.. the bill had to be done again. It seems kind of strange to go to all this work before a table is even done ordering! In another instance, we were given the bill ($60). The waiter took my card and came back saying it was denied. I looked at the new receipt, with a total of ($80). I told him that our bill stated $60, and the card had $70 available. åÊHe had forgotten to add on our last round of drinks, which changed the total. But yet he neglected to inform us before running the card. That was a little irritating, but not a big deal. He apologized, and everything was fine. åÊI think they've made some positive changes to the billing issues. åÊWhen we were there 2 weeks ago, the waiter asked if we needed anything else before bringing the final bill, and even when we decided to add on 1 drink afterwards, he brought a new bill with the new total before charging the card.

I have mixed feelings about my visit there so I will write this blog and let you be the judge.   The dÌ©cor in BJ's is a mix of American Pub dÌ©cor and modern styles. The atmosphere is really nice and the light fixtures are very modern. The restaurant is full of red upholstered booth seats with a few pub style tables in the bar area. When I walked into the restaurant I was greeted very promptly by the hostess and I was seated right away. I was given water right away and the waitress (whose name was Lindsey and you will understand why I'm naming names this time as you read on) came by to get our drink orders. It didn't take me long to make up my mind because I have had the pizza at the location in Reno before and knew it to be some of the best pizza in town. The waitress took quite a while to get back to our table but it was REALLY busy so I expected that my dinner might take a bit. When she came back with our drinks I placed my order. I ordered the chicken wontons appetizer served Thai style for $2.95, a side salad with balsamic vinaigrette for $2.95, and a medium Spicy Meatball deep dish pizza that I requested no onions on and I wanted bacon added; the pizza was $22.75 (Sorry there is no pizza pic... got a little distracted due to the events that unfolded).   The salad arrived within minutes and was delivered to us by another waitress; it was amazing how fast the salad came out! The pizza on the other hand took forever and we also never received our appetizers; I told Lindsey when she delivered the pizza. She wasn't very friendly or apologetic about forgetting the appetizers, in fact she acted like we were an annoyance to her so I told her to just forget the appetizers. I also asked the waitress for some ranch to go with the pizza and we each wanted a new drink (we had empty glasses for quite awhile now). It only took us each a bite to realize that our pizza was wrong and when we finally were able to waive the waitress down and tell her so she literally made a disgusted gasping noise and started walking away; as she walked away she said that she would have the manager over and before she had her back turned to us I literally saw her roll her eyes at us and shake her head.... now the experience had made a turn for the worse and I was fuming; I have never been treated so horribly by a server in my entire life! (And she still hadn't brought me the ranch I requested). The manager whose name was Eric came over to find out what was going on with our order. Eric was very courteous and explained that he would have our appetizers out and our pizza remade. He also expressed that he wanted to make things right and asked up what he could do for the inconvenience. I suggested maybe comping a drink or two and he said his manager didn't like him to comp alcohol so he would come up with something else. The waitress came by a few minutes after the manager left and asked us what had happened and we told her he was remaking our pizza so she took the pizza we had in front of us away (still no ranch). Our appetizers were delivered to us by another waitress again and it was a good thing they came because I was starving... I think at this point we had been there an hour or a little over that.   The pizza still took another 20 minutes to get to us and this time it was done right. I still had not received the ranch I requested and after trying to get the waitresses attention when she passed us by two times (she was most definitely ignoring us on purpose at this point) I almost had to shout to get her to come over to our table at which point I asked her for the ranch again. She came back with the ranch about 5 minutes later. The manager came back over to our table towards the end of our meal and told us he had comped the pizza and asked if there was anything else he could do... I told him no and that he was really excellent and that I appreciated his efforts. I didn't say one word to him about how rude and atrocious our waitress was and how bad she was at being a server. I literally considered giving her no tip which I have NEVER done in my life. Even thought her service was the worst I have ever received I still gave her an $8.00 tip which is far more than she deserved.   I can honestly say that I will probably never go back to BJ's in Sparks which is too bad because they have great food and a great manager. But, if BJ's is hiring this kind of low caliber server I can't say I want to visit them again; I don't go out to eat and spend my hard earned money so I can get treated like shit by a server.. excuse my french.   It's really too bad that horror stories like this happen; do you have a restaurant horror story, because I'd love to hear it... tell me where I don't want to go eat this time!

You are the first ever restaurant to get a 1 star..... whaaat! A BJ's, just keep reading and I'll explain.  First of all I like this franchise as a whole, pizza is good and I've had good times with friends at other locations.... but this one just plain out sucks. If you follow me I review pretty fairly, I give credit where credit is due, and owning a restaurant I know can be difficult. So I don't like giving negative reviews cause it brings the hard work of the owner down... but this was just plain out sad. We didn't even eat. Ok so here's what happened, my parents had to catch a flight so any restaurant with a 20+ minute wait we couldn't go to. So when we came here, we actually got seated immediately, so plus on them.... sadly that only plus isn't enough to even give it a 2 star. When we got seated, which this part was a minor gripe, my jacket got dirty from some sauce left on the table. Ok so I get it, if a waiter/waitress misses a spot on a table. For a place like this, it happens, I'll let that slide. If it were a higher end place then it's a bigger deal, but here it's not.  So we waited....and waited...and waited. Remember that whole ""cause my parents had a flight thing"" so anything past 20 minutes we couldn't go too! We waited for over 25 minutes. To our frustration, we asked a waiter if someone could help us. He looked confused so he said he'll get someone.... 10 minutes later still no one. So that was a 35 minute wait and still no one, not even to ask how we're doing. So we left. We were gonna be late.  I can see someone in the comment saying ""if you were in a hurry you shouldn't have gone there in the first place."" Well yeah you are right.... that's why we ask the hostess in the front how long the wait is. If we get seated immediately, then that means all is good and you shouldn't have to wait an additional 35 minutes for someone to come and assist you. Even if we weren't in a hurry, that's just sad. So we didn't eat and had to get something quick instead somewhere else. We just stormed out, they didn't try to stop us, which shows they didn't give a damn. So why should I?

Understanding this was a business decision, it thwarted the local brewers ability to make many great ""one-off"" offerings. åÊI remember getting a beer that may only be brewed in Covina for example. åÊ Local brewers would experiment with different concoctions which is no longer the case. åÊ Chino Hills (which did not brew) may be the closest location to me, but it was the unique offerings that led me to go out to Covina and other locations. åÊI actually enjoyed visiting multiple BJ's within the region. åÊ 2. åÊBJ's KILLED their happy hour menu about a year ago. åÊ  One thing that my family enjoyed about Happy Hour was they had a solid happy hour menu with great offerings, portions, and price. åÊ This is not longer the case with a menu change last year with many items we've enjoyed scratched! åÊAlso portions were cut down to size with price increases. 3. åÊAbout a year ago, BJ's took away my NUMBER ONE ITEM I LOVED ON THE MAIN MENU; the Open Face Chili Burger with wedge cut fries! If not visiting BJ's for Happy Hour and resorting to the main menu, I always got the open face Chili Burger. åÊThe Piranha Ale made Chili was ""BOMB.COM!"" åÊThe only time I can get chili now is during lunch with the Giant Stuffed Potato or in a Sourdough bowl. åÊBoth very good, but it's not the same as having that open faced chili burger I loved so much. All these changed happened right when the Chino Hills location got up and running. åÊI recall the server in Chino Hills stating that Chino Hills was a test place for the so called ""CRAPPY"" new and more healthier menu. åÊBJ's wanted to change their image ... personally I don't know why? åÊ Maybe they wanted more of a wine crowd.

When your guest comes up and asks for the door to be closed because he and his family are uncomfortable you can do these things. 1. Politely explain the situation, that the party has many older guests who have trouble with the stairs and that he will do his best to close it ASAP. 2. Offer to move us to another table. 3. Have one of your employees stand at the door and open it for the part as they come, this way the door doesn't have to be open for 20 minutes. 4. When your guests come up to you ask for anything, Try not to be such a smug jerk, remember that we are spending money at your restaurant also. You are in the service industry, try and remember that.

Our waiter was ""Don"" (Donald was the server name on the bill). I will refer to him as Mr. Smug.  When Mr. Smug approached us to take our drink orders, I asked him if there were any shareable salads.  ""You can share anything on the menu,"" was Mr. Smug's reply. Really? I did not know that. Thank you for enlightening me.  For those of you who don't know, BJ's menu is as thick as a user manual for an electronic device. I figured that the waiter would be more knowledgeable and would save us time with a recommendation since I only saw small side salads while there were ""shareable appetizers."" He finally directed me to an area in the menu that served salads as an entree which would be bigger than the other salads that I was looking at. See, it wasn't that difficult. åÊRight, Mr. Smug?  When he brought our drinks over, he proceeded to throw the coasters on the table like he was dealing a deck of cards minus the accuracy and finesse. When one person from my party started to move her coaster closer toward herself, Mr. Smug started ""Hey, hey why are you moving the coaster farther away from me? I have to reach over now!"" I thought he was joking because we were a party of four in a booth (Yeah, I know. LARGE party). And Mr. Smug appeared to be at least as tall, if not taller than me at 6'2"". Long reach. If he was trying to be a comedian, then he needs to keep his day job. Wait, this IS his day job. Hmmm... After we finished our mains, the table was clear and we were ready for dessert. Mr. Smug comes by and places the check at our table. I didn't ask for the check. And the dessert did not come with him. I then mentioned to him that we still have dessert on the way.  ""I know."" He said. Awkward pause.  I then mentioned that I didn't ask for the check and since he ""knew"" we weren't finished eating, then why bring the check?  ""So you don't feel comfortable with the check at your table right now?"" Mr. Smug asked.  Another awkward pause as I am still holding the check up in the air for him to take it, ""Ah, I would like the check when we are finished eating. Thanks."" He then proceeded to mention that during lunch, they tend to bring the check earlier because some people are in a rush because it is their business lunch hour etc. We were wearing shorts, t-shirts and flip-flops. I guess that screamed ""We are in a rush to get back to work!""  ""Do you bring the check even before all courses have been served?"" I asked.  ""Yeah, for lunch it's policy."" Mr. Smug replied. ""Wait, so during lunch, bringing the check before are all courses are served is policy?"" I verified. ""Yeah."" Mr. Smug said.  That seemed strange.  After our meal and our check, I spoke to the manager asked about this ""policy."" To credit her management skills, she was lovely and not defensive at all and somewhat apologetic. She mentioned that the wait staff can opt to bring the check earlier if they ""read"" the customers might be in a rush.  ""The check can be brought either with or after the last course."" (paraphrasing what she said).  I asked, is it ""policy"" to bring the check before all courses are served?"" ""No. It is not policy. There is no policy for that. The servers need to 'read' their customers."" She replied.  I told her that Mr. Smug's tone towards me and my family was somewhat disprespectful. And he could have answered all of my questions in a different way, but he chose the snarky path instead. She wanted to offer me coupons, but I don't see how that could correct the situation, so I kindly declined. What she failed to do was to mention what she would do about my concerns with Mr. Smug's service. I don't want him out of a job. That's not my goal especially in this economy.

I prefer though when they kept the pizookie in one tin and not splitting it into two smaller tins though when you want to split the flavor. You have to dig and everything gets crusty at the bottom of the smaller tin and it becomes harder to get the rest of the cookie =(. They give a lot of ice cream with the cookie which is awesome.

Our waitress was between rude and slightly nice? She was not excited at all and her demeanor was as if she had better things to be doing instead of being a polite server. We also noticed there were cliques of employees and lots of standing around doing nothing, this isn't optimal behavior at a restaurant. Now on to the food, the root beer wings were really good. The deep dish pizza was not- tasteless and no sauce to speak of, crust was buttery and greasy and the waitress wasn't surprised I said something about the lack of sauce she just brought out a cup of marinara sauce... I'm sad to say that we didn't even order dessert because I didn't want to be disappointed with that. Also I'd like to add I was disappointed by the response to the no sauce on the pizza, she didn't even inquire if we wanted a new pizza made, she just brought the sauce which was tacky in my opinion.

The food is pretty much what you would expect if you're looking for pub-type fare but I couldn't believe the options. It wasn't just burgers and wings, there were so many interesting things on the menu. I ordered the Lemon Thyme Chicken which was delicious. I love that they have an ""EnLIGHTened"" portion of their menu.  The food was good but the staff was incredible. We ordered a pitcher of beer and realized pretty soon that the waitress brought us the wrong beer. We let her know and she apologized and told us to just finish the pitcher we had and that she would bring a new one with the beer that we ordered at no extra cost to us. That was pretty much all my boyfriend needed to hear. It was a simple gesture but it goes a long way in terms of customer service. She was quick, attentive but not TOO attentive, friendly and very knowledgeable of the menu. It wasn't just her though, the hostess was great and every single staff member that we encountered was friendly and just GOOD at their job. We even called the manager over to let her know how impressed we were. We were there once before but just had drinks at the bar and the bartender was SO friendly and engaging. She overheard us talking about movies and ended up talking movies with us for the next ten minutes which was so fun. Oh and I would be remiss if I didn't mention the incredible beer selection.  Often times when you go out to eat, if a waiter or waitress isn't assigned to a table then they don't want to help that table and I get that. They work on tips and every second counts so I wouldn't hold that against anyone. But it seems like the staff at BJ's is trained to treat every single customer well regardless of whether or not they'll be tipped by that customer. It's rare and it's truly impressive.

BJ's has a good beer list, including their own, which is the real center of attention, I guess. Their actual menu is quite bloated and far too large, much like a lot of other chains (looking at you, CCF, especially). You have options here, but because there are so many things it means some of the things aren't going to be as great as the others - no restaurant staff can learn all of these items and prepare them perfectly each time. They have flatbread pizzas, burgers, tacos, ribs, sandwiches, wraps, salads, fish...far too many options. As for what we had? Two people ordered burgers, both MW. One was a bit dry with one side closer to well-done and a little black, but the other burger was perfect MW. The flatbread pizza appetizer was actually pretty good - I liked the sauce a lot.  I had the fish and chips, and the fish was cooked well with a nice breading but maybe a little greasier than expected or wanted.  All meals came with fries and the fries were actually good restaurant fries! Waitress was very nice and came back with an extra drink when I asked for a refill, so that's cool.

So I ended up going safe instead of trying something new. Next, I ordered from their åÊ$10 menu, and it was to be expected that it wouldn't be much to write home about. I was satisfied with my meal, but my girlfriend didnt care for hers. At the end, I got dessert and that was really good and on discount.

On the first visit, they put in the wrong pizza size for D, and brought out the erroneous one AND the right one, at different times, even though we told them to just go with the wrong one (and they're the ones that pointed out the error).

I went to BJs on 11/18/16, a Friday night, for dinner with my cousins. Right from the get-go, our service from our waitress was unacceptable. There were no smiles as she greeted us and sat us down in our booth. We began by ordering our drinks.I requested a water with lemon. Our drinks were brought out and I noticed there were no lemon, so I reminded the waitress that I had requested it. She said ok, she would bring it out. I ordered the garlic shrimp and asparagus pasta, an entree I order regularly and have grown to love. I specified I would not like any bread crumbs in my pasta, as well. After waiting for about 30 minutes, our food was brought out to us. This was the SECOND time we were seeing our waitress. She did not come check in on us while we were waiting to see if we needed anything. Yet again, she forgot to bring the lemons, although at this point, I was beginning to feel it was deliberate.  At this point, I tried pushing my frustrations aside and focusing on my meal, which I order regularly and am very familiar with. Unfortunately, my entree was on par with the customer service we were receiving... highly disappointing. There were barely 4 pieces of shrimp thrown into my pasta and of course, there were breadcrumbs.  I began looking for my waitress to let her know my food was not acceptable, however she was NO WHERE to be found. Yet again, she was not checking on us AT ALL. As I sat there and waited, everyone else at my table was eating their food. This was supposed to be my first real meal of the day, considering I worked all day, and I had really been looking forward to it. By the time our waitress finally showed up, I had eaten most of my meal. This was the third time we were seeing our waitress that night. She did not come check on us while we were waiting for our food, and she did not come check on us while we were eating our food. It was obvious she was not committed to providing us the customer service we usually receive at this restaurant. Nonetheless, I went ahead and informed her of my dissatisfaction. Instead of trying to alleviate my concerns, all she said was ""let me go get a manager.""  At this point, I had enough. This situation would not have escalated if our waitress had taken responsibility for her mistakes and offered us a sincere apology. The first manager that came out, a Caucasian woman, made the situation even worse. She didn't even bother to listen as I recounted our horrible experience and the nasty attitude of our waitress. All she could focus on was the fact that I had eaten a majority of the entree. I told her that I order this entree regularly, and there was significantly less shrimp than normal. After a few minutes of going back and forth with her, I really thought I was going to lose my mind. Even the manager was talking to us in such a rude manner, instead of apologizing for our ruined meal. Eventually she cut the conversation short and asked ""So, what is it that you want me to do?"" It was obvious that my concerns meant NOTHING to her and that she just wanted to shut me up at this point. I WAS HOLDING BACK TEARS AT THIS POINT because never have I, ever, been spoken to this way, at a place I chose to give my business to. At this point, I wanted this meal from hell to be over, so I told the manager there was nothing she could do for me at this point and to please just bring our check. She did not offer any ways she could alleviate my distress or come to a solution, she just said ok and left. A few minutes later, our waitress dropped our check off at our table without saying A WORD to us. There was no ""thank you for choosing to dine with us"" or ""im sorry your meal did not turn out the way you expected"" or even ""i hope you have a great night"". SHE. DID. NOT. SAY. A. WORD. This is what sent me over the edge. They were not treating us like humans at this point, much less paying customers. I took a look at the check and saw my entree on the bill, full price. When the waitress came back, I let her know I refused to pay for my meal, so she went to get the manager again. This time another manager came out, an African American male. He was much kinder than the others.He went ahead and apologized for and took the entree off our check. As we were waiting for him to bring our new check out, our waitress stood at the bar with two other waitresses. She was loudly and profanely telling them about how I ate my food and then didn't want to pay for it. I could hardly believe it. I was being accused of being a cheap liar right in front of my face. I was literally being attacked for speaking up about the unacceptable service she gave us. When the male manager returned. I informed him of what I had just witnessed. He said he did not see it, so there wasn't much he could do. On our way out, one of the waitresses called after me ""don't go out if you can't afford it.""

I would just 1st like to start by mentioning that BJs offers "" curbside delivery "" when you are placing a carry out order.  I placed my order around 8:30pm. I was told it would be about 15-20min for my delivery. When I called and requested the curbside, no one asked for a number to reach me on, no one asked for what make and model I would be in and no one mentioned where to park for this "" curbside "" that is offered.  I ordered a medium size pepperoni and cheese åÊCHICAGO deep dish pizza. I called BJs back to let them know I was in the front of the restaurant parked in a valet spot, because there are no designated "" curbside "" delivery spots. When I called again, no one asked what car I would be in, I had to mention it.  Around 9pm I got irritated and walked in and asked for my pizza. It was just sitting the heated area where pizzas are dropped off. I payed my bill, walked to car and checked the pizza ( they did not open the box to check the pizza). I noticed it was a chicken and bbq pizza... Not what I ordered. So I walked back in and ask to speak with the manager because I was simply irritated at this point.

He only said that he would walk it out. Didn't really answer anything about curbside for me at all.  15more min later and after everything I got my pizza around 9:30... Not cool.  Got home and tried eating the pizza, but it was way too doughy... It looked done on the outside but the cooked part of the pizza peeled right off and there was the base of the pizza... Doughy.

You can see into the kitchen from the dinning room, so watching 6 or more wait staff in there shooting the bull while your food gets cold is more than a little irritating. We could hear the other tables also complaining so it was not just us. I should add we were there at 11:30am on a Saturday, so not at all busy. This was our first time here, and it will be a bit before we return. Hope they get better, and I get a chance to improve this review!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=100134,Jerry C.,"Baltimore, MD",2,122,54,1,11/06/15,"Not a fan of this place. This was my third time here. Food taste like any commercial franchise place--some fresh and a lot of processed. Sitting at the bar the service was great. Once we moved to tables, it was mediocre. Management had too few servers to handle a Friday night. We rarely saw our server. Had to ask the bartender to åÊcheck on our drinks. One runner who brought our friends' pizza was too lazy to walk around the table and hand it to him. She just stuck it out for someone to grab so we could pass it around to the right person. The look on the runners face was ""really you gonna make me walk over 4ft?"" åÊFinally, at the end of the night, had to ask the bartender to take our checks because our server couldn't be found.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=100135,Charles Peter D.,"Towson, MD",0,21,,1,10/29/2015,Nothing special here.

I'm glad we did! We sat at the bar and were immediately greeted and introduced to both bartenders working. The lady that served us was engaging, made great suggestions and truly made the experience great. I ordered the Hickory Brisket and Bacon Burger, as suggested by the server. Although the burger was overcooked, it still tasted good. I also enjoyed their house drafts on tap, I would suggest the Hopstorm IPA. I would definitely return again just based on the service alone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=100138,Chase S.,"Baltimore, MD",0,21,16,3,11/23/2015,"The food is great! åÊThere is not a doubt about that, but tonight's service was terrible. åÊThe wait for the food was long (and there is not a lot of patrons in the restaurant).

I had read good things regarding this place on their facebook page but we wanted to be the judges for ourselves. Service was awesome, atmosphere and dining experience was awesome. I LOVE the wide variety of selections they have to choose from. Their beer and desert selection is awesome. We had a bacon cheeseburger and the ravioli. The burger had a wonderful flavor and cooked perfect for a well done burger. The ravioli was sooooo good. It had the perfect amount of meat and cheese. The only thing I will mention to the server if it happens again is that the food could have been slightly warmer when served.

Great location, but unless you know the area, parking stinks. The food was really good and I would give more stars, but the first time they were out of root beer. The second visit, the root beer was extremely flat and I couldn't drink it. The avocado rolls are fantastic. Very unique and the dipping sauce is excellent. The service was great both times as well. Although the second time, the waiter seemed to disappear at the end. I would go back because I enjoyed the food.

The first time our Bartender forgot to put in our food order and since we had a movie to catch, we weren't able to get it. Second time wings took 25+ minutes to arrive to the table and the ribs were extremely tough. We said something to the server and she didn't even acknowledge the complaint. The third and worst time we sat in the cocktail area and we stared at our drinks for 10 minutes before we had to flag our server down to get them. Again wings took extremely long and had to cancel them. åÊZero stars. Terrible service for just OK food. Avoid at all costs in my opinion.
