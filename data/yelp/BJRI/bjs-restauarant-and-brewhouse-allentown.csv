Anne J.,"New York, NY",29,8,5,5.0,12/9/2017,"We were here when the manager refused to serve alcohol to the party group with the ugly sweaters and blinking lights! No racism was shown' first of all when we walked in a mixed gay couple were seated enjoying drinks! Another family of Hispanics also came in! 1) the girl said at the bar ""I'm here to party"" 2) we were enjoying beers and sandwiches.  Highly recommend both food and the service was bar none the best we have had.  3)the manager offered to let them order food and have non alcoholic beverages!!!        -- thank you management for keeping us safe as we head back to New Jersey with 5 less drunks on the road.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-allentown
Jessica P.,"Phoenixville, PA",0,3,,4.0,11/18/2017,"Love, love, love this place. Boneless wings are addicting and the pizzookies are absolutely, positively one of the best food inventions ever. The atmosphere and decor are perfect. However, it's the friendly service and peach berry tea that keeps me coming back time and time again.  My one and only complaint at this time is the floor.  I have almost fallen on my behind probably every single time I've been there. No matter what kind of shoes I wear - sneakers, boots, flats - I feel like I'm ice skating my way to my table or the bathroom.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-allentown

Tyler Z.,"Whitehall, PA",31,22,,3.0,1/13/2018,"Not worth all the hype. It's not a bad restaurant by any means, they usually just have a long wait and it defiantly isn't worth it. I came here a couple times but ended up at a different place because of the long wait.  But i finally came for lunch one day. Took a little to get served, not sure why the place was pretty empty. I ordered the lunch special of margarita pizza and broccoli cheddar soup. The pizza was average, the soup was much better than Panera's which i enjoy very much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-allentown
Steve I.,"Wynnewood, PA",55,244,1473,4.0,7/1/2017,"Enjoyed my lunch with friends here today. Place was packed but we were promptly seated and our order was quickly taken. Our drinks were promptly delivered. I liked the taste of the beers in my flight, each beer clearly identified.            Everyone enjoyed the food that they ordered. I had the ribeye steak which was cooked perfectly medium and the great sides that I picked from a huge selection, the golden roasted beets with feta and the couscous Mac and cheese made with large Israeli couscous were absolutely delicious. My wife had the chicken blt with avocado with came with crispy French fries. She cleaned her plate which is an excellent indicator that it was good.                My friend really liked his huge pulled pork sandwich which came with a side of slaw and more of those delicious fries. The server was friendly, knowledgeable and quick. Will stop back for sure when in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-allentown
Becky D.,"Reading, PA",131,244,370,3.0,8/30/2017,"My husband and I stopped here after coming home from NY. We've driven by it before and decided we should try it out. It was fairly busy when we stopped on a Saturday during lunch. However, we just took a seat at the bar.  The menu.. is huge. Actually I find it to be a little extensive and all over the place with what they're trying to be. However, our food was good. I ordered tacos but they literally kept falling apart.  The beer... is awesome! I did a flight of their beers which was excellent. However, my husband ordered a beer that wound up kicking 3/4 of the way. If it weren't for the manager, I think the girl would have charged us. No joke.  The staff... I've had better. There were two bartenders on at the time. The girl was literally on her phone the entire time. She barely refilled drinks or checked on us. He guy never once came over for anything. I'm not sure if they work together or take turns having guests. We felt as if we were inconveniencing them, especially the girl. When she did wait on us she was nice but kind of felt forced. The manager was nice however and seemed very hands on. It's always good to see that in a restaurant.  I'll definitely give it another whirl but maybe just grab a table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-allentown

I had the Thursday rib special, which included a half rack of ribs, a salad, two sides, and a mini pizookie, all for $15! The food was delicious, as well as the atmosphere.

Waitress is snorting up her snot while we're trying to order. Grossing me out. We order our drinks I get a beer and my wife a water, it take 25 mins to get my wife's water. And then my beer came 30mins later.  Our food was undercooked. Both our burgers were undercooked. Our bacon was raw.  Just very unhappy, and I feel sick. If I get sick because the food was so undercooked, you'll be hearing from me!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-allentown
Bianca M.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,2,,5.0,10/12/2017,"Went to dorney park and decided to come to BJs to eat after. Went with a big party (about 10 of us). The wait time wasn't long and our server was Michacelia (not sure if I spelt her name right). She was so nice and helpful with everything. She was very attentive to our table, accommodated all of our needs and created conversation with us and just made the experience very very enjoyable. Exceptional service on her part!  Bjs had an extensive menu so there's a lot to chose from and the food was great. For appetizers I got the queso dip and others got the boneless wings. They were really good. For dinner I got an avocado burger which was very good while others at my table got the deep dish pizza (which was a decent size), soup, pasta, and more. Everyone was pretty happy with their dish. Only complaint was the jambalaya which was way too salty.  Bjs is known for their poozkie, which I ended up taking to go because I was so full but it was great! So overall I had a great experience at BJs but mainly because of our server Michacelia! She was so great. Therefore If you happen to pass by this BJs restaurant location in Allentown, ask for her!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-allentown

Dan A.,"Grand Bay, AL",9,10,15,2.0,2/3/2017,"Parking and layout of restaurant is very nice, lots of tv's, but music was a bit to loud, i couldn't talk across the table without raising my voice pretty much. Food, expensive... Thier large pizza is 14"", and while the deep dish tasted pretty good, at $25 it wasn't a good deal.. Bone in wings... can you say small? Now say it again while imagining the wings even smaller.. and at $10.50 for 10 wings. Way to expensive, i can't think of anywhere else around here that doesn't sell bigger wings for less,  maybe if they were normal size.. naa thier sauce choice wasn't impressive either. Dessert was good though! Had the smores ice cream thingy, $6 something, had a free coupon. But i can see paying for that. Didn't try the beers, so ill let those reviews to others... I probably won't be back, unless they run a 50% groupon or something... and ill have to think about it then. Didnt have a wait problem like others, was pretty fast, waitress was nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-allentown
Teresa H.,"Lansdale, PA",28,239,32,3.0,7/16/2017,"Bj's, a place where a pizza cookie is a piz-zoo-ky not a piz-ookie. At least that's how they say it. Last evening we chose to have an early dinner here to try it out. We had a coupon, which pulled us in despite the lowish reviews. We both ordered beer samplers (4 samples for almost $7). We also had avocado egg rolls, cauliflower tacos with Brussel sprouts, a quinoa shrimp bowl, and a salted caramel pizookie. For me, the avocado egg rolls were the highlight of the meal. As a vegetarian, it can be hard to find dishes that are complex and delicious when dining out. These were perfect, 5 stars! I would return just to eat these. The beers were hit and miss. I enjoyed the hefeweizen and seasonal nit wit. The red was lacking and the blonde was bland. I tasted my partner's stout which was decent. I enjoyed that it was on nitro. The hopstorm lacked depth. Neither of us enjoyed that or the red. I'd rate the beer 3 stars. As for entrees, both left something to be desired. I felt that the cauliflower tacos sounded awesome, but they were lacking. The pita was strangely spongey. The cauliflower was bland and the entire dish underseasoned. I wasn't interested in the grain side, so I paid an upcharge for siracha Brussel sprouts. These were not very good either. My partner, who is less picky than me tasted my dish and said he thought it was pretty awful. I'd rate this dish a 2. He got the quinoa with shrimp. He said he was surprised he got as many shrimp as he did, but the flavor was just okay. 3 stars.  Lastly, we split a salted caramel piz-zoo-ky. This was the second best part of the meal. Warm and gooey. 4stars. The service was strange. The hostess was not very friendly and kind of just sent us the the bar area without actually asking us if we wanted to sit there. We waited a while for menus. Drinks came fast enough and our server was friendly. Our appetizer also came out pretty quickly. My partner's entree came out a while before mine and the guy who delivered it acted like he didn't know I ordered an entree. It was strange. Our bill was also brought before we had a chance to give our coupon or ordered dessert, also strange. One other annoyance is that we were dining around 420-430ish. My partner wanted a pork chop which stated after 4. He was told he couldn't have it because it wasn't late enough (despite being after 4). Before we even got dessert a pork chop was delivered to a patron behind us. Kind of annoying. Overall, service is 3 stars. The actual restaurant is nice and clean, but they missed an opportunity to offer outside seating and strangely sat a family with kids in the bar area. The menu could do a better job for vegetarians. Why do we need to pay the same price for a dish with meat as the vegetarian option? Overall I might return, but I'm not running back...except maybe for those egg rolls.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-allentown
Thomas K.,"Reading, PA",11,191,640,4.0,2/23/2017,Service was fabulous. We stopped in before a concert and were not disappointed. The beer was decent and the food was good. We ordered the potato skins as an app and there was a lot for the price. I had the ribs which were good with a little spice at the end. She had the steak which was cooked perfectly. The pizza we ordered was stacked with ingredients. I'd definitely go here again and based off the Tuesday crowd I'd make reservations ahead of the weekend,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-allentown
Kathy T.,"Saylorsburg, PA",7,189,247,5.0,1/26/2017,"My husband and I have been to this restaurant/brewery quite a few times, we wanted to visit this establishment a few times due to there large menu (135 items on the menu) before writing up a review. First we recommend calling ahead, and also downloading there BJ's app, you can view your check and pay on your app. Which we think is a great feature. If you arrive before 6:00 pm they have happy hour, which is $2.00 off any shareable appetizers.  We have tried the the avocado spring rolls and the chicken dumplings as appetizers. The avocado spring rolls are amazing with the sauce it comes with.  For dinner, we have tried the flat bread pizza, the deep dish pizza , spaghetti & meatballs, full rack of ribs, brisket sandwich, there burgers, all great and full of flavor. Our favorite is there fall off the bone ribs.  Can't forget there dessert, warm cookie with scoop of ice cream on top.  Only draw back is the food comes out to fast, you need to slow them down. And would recommend during busy hours that they have employees checking there stock in the restrooms.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-allentown

G T.,"Staten Island, NY",0,6,,1.0,10/21/2017,I must say I am very upset about my recent experience at this establishment... The food was semi decent overall but when your overwhelmed by fruit flies that are all over your food...and the napkins from the previous people who sat where you are currently sitting are all over the floor .. and they forget the two things you order plus your waiter/bartender ignore you... it can be more than frustrating... My wife got French fries with the remnants of whatever was in the fryer before her order...and mind you she ordered sweet potato fries which made there way over to us when we were finished with our meal I still tipped because that's just me... but there are plenty  of restaurants in the Lehigh valley worth checking out before you waste your money here ...before I left I spoke with the manager on duty Mike who did nothing at all about the situation and basically was useless... I will not be back...p.s. don't sit at the bar maybe you will have better luck...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-allentown

We also ordered pizza with meatballs on the whole pizza. Meat balls were only on half, we pointed it out and waitress returned after 10 minutes with additional meatballs that looked like puppy chow.

Only once out of a dozen times was the food missing items, dressings etc. takeout is very unreliable which is why they lost a star in this review.  The bar has great drinks, the craft brewed soda is really good. Food is good, menu changes seasonally and desserts are good.  Salads and pizza are favorites for the vegetarian side of the family.

Karma S.,"Macungie, PA",80,34,4,2.0,8/1/2017,"This is our second time eating here, we had a terrible experience the first time, when they just opened, I waited to review the place until I gave them some time to adjust to the crowds, train the wait staff etc... well six months later, we went back. Nothing has changed as far as their service.  My husband and I went in yesterday for dinner, the restaurant was not busy we got a table right away.  We both ordered a drink, and started with appetizers. Our Brussels sprouts came out, and wings... we each had a one wing, then my husbands salad came out one minute later, then low and behold our main entrees. That was upsetting, can't we just sit and eat our appetizers? Who eats that fast, why was everything was brought out on the table at once? Not to mention our food would get cold, and clearly there was no more room. We didn't even have the plates for our appetizers yet. I can't review the food because we complained to the manager and said we were leaving. One of the responses from the wait staff, was we will just put the food under the heater until you're ready. This happened to us both times, we went in to eat. The waitstaff wants to turn those tables quickly. There are lots of other pubs around where you can sit, eat and relax. Stay away from this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-allentown?start=20

Nathan W.,"Allentown, PA",33,2,1,3.0,8/20/2016,"It's going to take a little time.  The staff was very friendly except one frustrated sounding young man excusing himself as he was trying to do something with the floor mats near the entrance when I arrived to the very busy location around 5:45 on a Saturday. This is the stores first week open to the public so it's understandable that things will need to get sorted. I sat at the bar and the bar staff was excellent, friendly but hard at work turning out a considerable number of their specialty cocktails and glasses of their full line of house brand beers. The bartender in my immediate vicinity took a few moments to suggest their taster flights, four tasters around 5oz. each. He was right, it's a good and affordable way to familiarize yourself with their line. I found all of the eight I tasted to be very palatable, the hopstorm IPA was pretty impressive.  I ordered the 14oz. ribeye medium well with their signature white cheddar mashed potatoes and roasted brussel sprouts. Here's where the learning curve was a little off. The first steak came out medium well and I politely asked if I could get it with a little red or pink left in the center. The manager brought out my re-fired steak and was very kind about the situation, however this steak was a much less marbled cut and noticeably tougher as I cut into it. This time it was very rare, sporting a cool red center. The manager took it back to the kitchen for one more go around. When it came back medium well with a good size chunk missing I didn't have the heart to say anything but thank you. It's going to take some time for the kitchen to get the hang of things, but this place is loaded with potential. Several guests near me had the ribs and jambalaya and were very satisfied with their selections. I should add that during one of the do over waits a bartender offered me a bowl of soup and the calm chowder is spectacular. Also the cheddar mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts were very good.  I was a little surprised that after all of the back and forth with my entree, the soup at no charge was the only consideration they made for my inconvenience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-allentown?start=20
Jay R.,"Waikiki, Honolulu, HI",0,3,,5.0,11/11/2017,Ever since they opened near us we have liked the place and have visited many times. The food has always been good but you need to remember that it can get really busy here and the wait time to get a seat can be long. They also have some great programs like free food for veterans on Veterans Day weekend. What encouraged me to write this review is the really special thing they did today. It's a super busy day and wait times are crazy. They are giving free pizza to people waiting in line. Seriously which restaurant feeds people for free before they actually eat at that restaurant. Just shows they are committed to great service. That extraordinary gesture and consistently good food whenever we have been here deserves the 5* rating they got from me today.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-allentown?start=20
Sarah R.,"Erie, PA",189,96,437,4.0,12/23/2016,"Yesterday was my first visit and I really enjoyed it! We went during lunch and it was packed but the wait was only about ten minutes. However, if you plan to go during lunch be aware that wait times can be very long.  The menu is about 20 pages long and has something for everyone! There is also a mm extensive lunch menu. I opted for unlimited soup and salad for $7.95 and you can change your soup and salad each time. Salad options were house, Caesar, wedge or tomato and mozzarella. Soup options were lentil, tomato, chicken tortilla, clam chowder and cheddar broccoli. Everything was fresh and delicious. We also ordered avocado egg rolls for an app, which is a must! They are creamy and a little bit spicy.  There are SO many beers on tap. I'd say between 25-30, maybe more. They also have their own brand of beers and offer about ten different ones. For dessert we had a pazookie (sp?) which is a warm baked cookie topped with ice cream. I had a mini triple chocolate which was to die for! They have about 8 different flavors. Service was a little hit or miss. Our server forgot my beer and made mistakes on the checks, but overall was pleasant.

Drew W.,"Bethlehem, PA",6,54,2,3.0,1/17/2017,"Went to BJ's the other night with a group of 7. ALthough it was packed when we got there, our table was ready a solid 15 minutes before our 7:00pm reservation. I was looking forward to trying BJ's out because word on the streets was that it is a good spot. This place has an upscale PJ's or Buffalo Wild Wings feel to it. Service was great, and there were enough TV's that you could watch the Sunday night football game anywhere you looked.  The food however was underwhelming.  I ordered the brisket burger which I ordered to be medium. It was served well done. There was one part of my burger that was medium but the rest of it, overdone. One of the most average things I've ever eaten. One of the members of the dinner party got the pulled pork, which she said was ok but not the best she's had.  Another got one of their salads which received the same reaction as the pulled pork. The menu is the size of a textbook which is fine, but this place is having some serious identity problems with the extensive variety of food that they have. I think they would be better off with a smaller menu and figuring out how to hit those items out of the park, but thats just me.   Their house beer was solid. I had their IPA which I think was called the hopstorm IPA? and the pale ale was palatable as well. Overall, this place is average. I don't know if they're a chain but it definitely has that feel.

The bowl of soup looks big until you put your spoon in and it's like one inch deep. The shrimp taco was bad, the 3 shrimp in the large stale left over tortilla were cold and grilled yesterday.

She was extremely knowledgable about the menu, and recommended the perfect beer for my meal. The food was super tasty. I've gotten the BJ's favorite pizza, which came out in this deep dish pan, making the crust so crispy (all about that crust). Toppings were loaded, and the sauce was plentiful. Definitely would recommend again. I also had the avocado egg rolls (mmm so much gauc yummm) and the crispy jalapeno burger, which was cooked perfect medium rare, and was simply delicious. The restaurant itself has a great modern atmosphere, bathrooms are tidy and clean, and the tables are comfy (important for me since I have back issues). The location of the restaurant itself is also pretty awesome since it's smack dab in the middle of the new Hamilton Crossings. I had a 45 min wait for dinner the one time, but we just went shopping nearby, so it was no big deal. Anyway, It seems like a lot of the reviewers here have had a less than stellar dining experience, but for me, I was really impressed, especially with the service. Hands down, if you come here, request Crystal, she'll take care of you for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-allentown?start=20
Kealii G.,"Allentown, PA",70,55,178,3.0,10/22/2016,"I've been to this restaurant two times so far but I'm still not ready to write a full review. Unfortunately I ordered the same thing both times.  I had the Guacamole Burger with a side of mixed vegetables. I really liked the burger and the vegetables were excellent. I also had one of their house beers which was also very good. Overall thoughts are that this menu is way too big, the service is great, and food quality is good. I wanted to give this place four stars but friends I dined with were less impressed. Tip: download their app. I did and got buy one get one free entrée!

James M.,"Langhorne, PA",55,2,,5.0,7/26/2017,"Last Monday, my wife and I found ourself out in Emmaus looking for a nice spot to grab a beer and some pub food. Despite there being a few cool spots nearby, we soon realized that most non chain restaurants in the area are closed on Mondays, so after searching around online, we decided on BJ's. Walking in, the first thing I noticed was how open it is inside, and how cool of an atmosphere they had. It's somewhere in between a sports bar, and a hipster gastropub. They have a few TVs with sports playing around the restaurant, but nothing too loud and distracting, and they have a giant chalkboard listing all the different beers they had on tap (including the ones they brew themselves), categorized by style. Very convenient and a cool idea. They have a huge menu. It's almost overwhelming but in a good way. Plenty of bar food, from deep dish pizzas that they're known for, to burgers, tacos, wraps etc. and a bunch of unique twists. They also have plenty of healthier or vegetarian options, and they list the calories beneath each item on their menu, which I appreciate. We both enjoyed our food, especially the Mediterranean Tacos, and finished by sharing a pizzookie, which was also amazing! The service was great too. I can't think of a single thing that I'd change. We'll definitely be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-allentown?start=40
Drew R.,"Allentown, PA",0,7,,1.0,10/29/2016,"This is SUPPOSED to be a ""brewhouse"", so when they bring you a bad beer, demand a new one! When your beer comes out with bubbles clinging to the glass or no head, your beer is not in a beer-clean glass. When it comes out completely flat, either gas is not getting to the barrel, the barrel is damaged, the wrong tap is being used for that type of beer, or they just washed the glass and it was still warm. These factors affect the taste of the beer and, yes, they WILL serve these to you.  There is obviously no training here, either for the bartenders pouring these beers or the servers bringing them to the table.  If it's not right, it should have never left the bar. And make sure they take the bad beer off your bill.  There is no concern for taking care of that either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-allentown?start=40

OR, maybe you could check in via the app on arrival...  if other corps notice when you arrive, I'm sure they BJ's could work this out.  Hope this changes soon...

Samantha S.,"Allentown, PA",2,12,,2.0,11/3/2016,"I've been here twice, giving all places the benefit of the doubt, as every place and everyone has bad days. However, the food cannot be saved. Ordered the calamari appetizer (actually both times, before I realized why the dish sounded familiar) - very greasy and oily and burnt, which is usually indicative of deep frying at too low of a temp but leaving it in the oil too long to make up for it. Main dishes were the deep dish pizza (taste was fine, nothing spectacular, but toppings were just a thin layer across the top, with a very doughy crust), a bread bowl clam chowder (bread to soup ratio was probably 2.5 to 1, taste wasn't terrible, just not memorable), a fried jalapeno topped burger (it's a burger, probably the best dish at our table), and the kale/brussel sprout salad (this dish made me cry, it was that bad, and I love both kale and brussel sprouts - there was no cohesion of flavor, just baby kale straight from the bag tossed with less than a handful of brussel sprouts, and I honestly couldn't tell you what flavor the dressing was - it was that bland). Wait time is long, since it's new and everyone wants to try the new place. Definitely not worth coming for the food. Hang out with friends at the bar? Sure, hard to mess up beer on tap.

Dee M.,"Allentown, PA",3,60,37,2.0,4/8/2017,"The hype around this restaurant coming to the area was profound. My family and I constantly talked about checking it out and just couldn't find the time, until now. What a disappointment!! First off, I really enjoyed the convenience of the app which allowed us to put our names on the waitlist ahead of arrival and the text message to alert us when our table was ready. The atmosphere of the restaurant was cool and crowded with a relaxed pub feel. Our waitress was very pleasant and good at promoting the menu. My son ordered a root beer, which we were told was made in house. He raved that it was delicious and couldn't get enough. That's where the compliments pretty much end. Right off the bat, the silverware and dishes were filthy. Filthy!! Our waitress apologized profusely and swapped them out for what she claimed came ""straight out the dishwasher"".  This should have been a warning. We ordered the root beer glazed ribs for the appetizer and the flavors kind of fell flat. There was no explosion in my mouth which totally contradicted the ribs' appearance. The cole slaw that came with it was better. The peach iced tea, which I was told was sweetened, of course wasn't. Then came the deep dish pizza, that we were told BJ's is famous for. Really it's the reason we were dying to try this place. Well what can I say? The pizza is in no way shape or form ""deep dish"". And it took us a minute to realize, but the pizza looked and tasted exactly like DiGiorno's frozen pizza. We paid $24 for what I could have bought in my grocer's frozen section for about 7 bucks. Don't get me wrong, it was pretty good. It was just DiGiorno good. After this pizza debacle, our great waitress suggested a dessert that sounded too good to pass up. Her description of it's twice fried beignet covered in cinnamon and powdered sugar and topped with ice cream, fresh strawberries, strawberry sauce and whipped cream sounded simply divine. What we received was anything but. The beignet was so hard that cutting into it, much less chewing it, was a chore. It just tasted like a stale donut. No cinnamon. No powdered sugar. The tiny dollop of ice cream and strawberries couldn't save this disastrous end to a completely lackluster meal. I've come to the conclusion that maybe this place is strictly for the craft beers and drinks (which I did not try). Maybe I'll try this place again but just for a drink and an app if I'm too drunk to notice the lack of flavor. Maybe....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-allentown?start=40

Tara C.,"Tampa, FL",45,132,62,4.0,8/21/2016,"This is a 3.5...rounded up. First, this location is SMALL. The bar area is small and the dining area is small. Wait time was 1.5 hrs for a table. I can't imagine anyone would wait that long. However this is the Lehigh Valley and there isn't much else out there. I am a fan of BJ's. Having lived out west in Las Vegas and Los Angeles, I've been to a few BJ's. This location is the smallest of all. BJ's is a solid chain restaurant. Decent food, nice beer selection. One of the reasons I liked BJ's out west was because of the size of the bar area. You could always get a seat...not so here. This is opening week so you would expect things to not go as planned. My biggest concern is that I watched the west coast trainers BUSTING their butts, while the local team wasn't as engaged. That's concerning because the trainers will be gone in a few weeks...and the locals will be left on their own. Management team was engaged, trainers engaged, tons of employees...time will tell once it's left to the local crew.

Let me state for the record, my wife hasn't had as many bad experiences as I have.  Our first time there was about 3 weeks after opening. We sat ourselves in the bar area because there was over an hour wait...on a Sunday night at 830. My wife order a flatbread pizza and I ordered the beef dip. I ordered mine without the aoli sauce. We waited about 45 minutes for the food to arrive. My sandwich was cut in half. I ate the first half and it was pretty good. The second half was slathered with sauce. It's like they realized mid stroke that the sandwich wasn't supposed to have sauce on it and said ""oh well"". Cut it in half and sent it out. That's lazy. My wife's flatbread was burnt. I sent my sandwich back and got another one.  Second visit we sat at the bar again because of a long wait. I ordered wings as an appetizer and the ribs as a meal. We waited about 30 minutes for the food. The main meal came first and the server asked if there was anything else she could get me. I said ""yes. How about the appetizer?""  It was there a few seconds later. It was a bit annoying. Wings were good. Ribs were ok.  Last night we went a third time. Brussels sprouts for appetizer. They came out fairly quickly and they were good.  Then the food came out. Here's were it went wrong. When I ordered my food, I asked the server if he recommended the fish and chips or the sirloin. He said definitely the sirloin. He said he had it the other day and it was great. When it came it was small, thin and dry as a bone. But here's what really bothers me. Their menu claims ""house made sides"". I ordered the mashed potatoes. When I pay $18 for a meal, I expect real mashed. Not instant mashed. I guess adding powder to boiling water is technically house made. Really sad. My wife wanted me to return my meal. I don't want to be comped for my meal. I want a good meal.

They were ok, came out a bit cold and could use more sauce - a bit dry. Went with my girl and we both ordered burgers. Very nicely done, served in an aluminum tray with thinly crispy fries. Nice touch! Fries are great but they weren't steaming hot which means you have to gobble them down quick!! To accompany the burgers we ordered some salad. Mozzarella and tomato salad was good. The menu is a bit way too big for my taste. Salads, pasta, pizza, fish, chicken, steak, veggie dishes. A bit overwhelming when you are hungry and really want to eat. It's like they combined the menu from Friday's, Apple Bees, Red Robbin and Joes Crabshack.  With so many options it's not possible to make everything perfect.  My chef always told me - simplicity is the success in any kitchen. I would recommend it - if you want a new place.

We unfortunately did not make any reservations or call ahead, but figured since it was brand new, there wouldn't be much of a wait. We were very wrong on our part. However, they must have close to 0 tables for more than 6 people. We were told it would be about an hour. So we waited. Then it turned into an hour and half. We were told a table was just sitting around. It took nearly 2 hours and 10 minutes for us to be seated. When we were seated, the service was great, we had quite a few servers for our table and they were very efficient. A few of our orders got messed up, but besides that the food was pretty good. Went a few other times just for drinks at night and it's been hit or miss. Sometimes the service is good, other times you can have a  miserable server and it's very slow. I was there as recent as Friday in which a guest in our party did call ahead seating. However, when we arrived, she was told by the hostess that they had ""no idea"" what position we were in for the wait. We ended up getting seats at the bar but all in all, we probably would have waited roughly an hour for a table. Food is good. Drinks are good. Wait times on weekends anytime from 6PM-8PM are usually pretty lengthy. App does not work. Don't bother with call ahead seating, it doesn't do anything.

Stay away, should have known better ordering a Hawaiian  dish from a chain restaurant located in landlocked Pennsylvania. Lastly we ordered a deep dish hawaiin pizza.

Rick O.,"Macungie, PA",0,2,,3.0,9/22/2016,"I've been to BJs twice for dinner now since it opened. I thought it was a nice place to grab a quick meal overall. I would've probably given it 2.5 stars if given the option.  Wait: I usually wouldn't put the wait time as a separate topic but my experiences here warranted it. The first time for two people walking in it took us about 45 minutes to be seated. Not bad, especially for being relatively new. Second time had a party of four. We used their app to check-in ahead of time. It told us to wait an hour, which was fine in the comfort of our own home. We got there and were told we would be seated next (my wife was nine months pregnant at the time). Unfortunately we had to wait for an additional hour and twenty minutes before being seated, with many parties who walked in being seated before we were.  There didn't seem to be a method to the madness. Why do the online check in to begin with? Maybe it was just ironing out some of the kinks. I think they underestimated demand. Definitely needs improvement regardless.  This was extremely frustrating and will make me hesitate before going back.  Service: Both times out servers were very friendly and knowledgeable. It seemed like they were spread thin but were never short with us or made us feel hurried. It did take them a good amount of time to refill drinks/waters. They were understaffed both times and it showed. The servers themselves were great though given the circumstances.  Ambiance: The restaurant is on the smaller side square footage-wise, but the high ceilings made it feel more open.  I was a fan of the decor. Exactly what I would want in a brewhouse environment. I realize it is new but everything was nice and clean! Noise level was about what I expected. A little on the loud side but didn't prevent you from carrying a conversation.  Food: I was pleasantly surprised with the food quality and their selection is very expansive. I had the chicken pita tacos with quinoa and thought it was great. I've also had the bison burger and thought it was good, not great. Generous portions. You can eat fairly nicely (steaks, salmon platter) or go simple (pizza/burgers).  It was tough for me to make a decision on what to order based on the menu size. Drinks:   I'm a beer drinker so I can't speak for their mixed drinks, though I was very satisfied with their beer selection. Lots of sections on draft. I sampled the beers they brewed, most of which were above average, and a few (including a seasonal collaboration beer with Green Flash Brewing) were great. They had a good mix of craft beers both local and west coast. I'm fairly certain they had your usual bar beers (lights and lagers) contrary to what another review said. The menu highlights their house-brewed beers and shows the other draft beers as a separate list. The craft beer selection is showcased on a big chalkboard at the back of the restaurant and seems to be updated regularly. You can get flights of any of the beers they have on draft, they do not limit them to only BJs beers. Though you can certainly find better/more expansive beer menus in the Lehigh Valley, theirs isn't one to scoff at.  Value: I thought the prices were very reasonable and if you look online (I think even on Yelp) you can find coupons for $$$ off or a free dessert.  For what they offer I would even say many of the prices were cheaper than expected. I definitely felt like I got more than I paid for. No complaints here! Bottom Line:   Good food at a fair price. Great beer selection. Be ready to wait for a table around dinner time regardless of calling ahead. Still need to improve the seating process. I probably won't go back until it gets a little less hectic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-allentown?start=100

There is also a full bar that offers mixed drinks and wines. I did notice 4 garage doors hanging, with tracks to be pulled down. So guessing one side could be semi-closed off for larger groups. I do suggest you down load their App, so that you can place your name on the seating list ahead of time.

Michael B.,"New York, NY",0,8,,1.0,8/28/2016,"So I have been to the location several times since the opening. On my past visits everything has been great. Our server Hanna was fantastic. She was very helpful and was there for all of our needs. We started out with the calamari as an appetizer. It was ok a little bland but good. My wife tried the piadia and I ordered the rib eye ""medium rare"" as the main course. When the food arrived my wife's dish was great. I was asked to cut in to my stake to verify that it was cooked correctly and it was over cooked. At this point it's no problem I understand that the kitchen can be busy and to be honest things happen. So as most know to get a medium rare steak its 9 mins top on a hot grill. After waiting 15 mins and my wife almost finish with her meal I ask Hanna if she could please check on my meal. She comes back with the steak and when I cut in it once again it is over cooked. At this point my irritation it at MAX. I tell Hanna just to take it back and not to worry. This is where matters get WORST! The manager Jodi comes to the table to let me know that he is sorry that this happened and if I would like him to make it again. I stated that is not necessary I have lost my appetite. He proceeded to tell me that he doesn't want me to leave hungry that he can bring a menu and he will make sure that it comes out right. I told him that my wife has finished her meal and I just want to leave. He said please it will not take long to get the food out and it will be his treat. So I agreed to order something else. I ordered a sandwich due to it being fast and easy. Little did I know that not only did it take about 18 mins for it to come out and in a Togo box!!!! Now I have lost all patience. I tell Hanna just to take my card and charge me for the meal that all I want is to leave. Lets also add that they charged me for the sandwich. She goes to Jodi to let him know of the mishap and he seems not to care. Just rolled his eye and removed the sandwich from my bill and charged my card of the rest of the meal. When we go out we never expect to get anything for free even if there is a mishap with our orders but never have I had a careless manager handle my problem with my meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-allentown?start=100

Pizza is ok. Brussels sprout app not so good. Salad good, but hey, it's a salad.  Went here last night at 5:10 pm on a Monday. Not busy at all, no wait. However, my daughter & I waited 15 minutes for the server to even greet us. She took our drink order and talked with her friends.  We waited another 15 minutes for our beverages.  It was almost 30 minutes b 4 we had our drinks. I ordered a water and a house Cabernet Sauvignon. She didn't write it down, she brought me no water and a Savignon Blanc. Sent it back. We only ordered two burgers to eat in and a chicken club to go. She didn't write that down either.  It seemed like forever for the burgers. My daughters burger had no cheese but we didn't want to wait for that too so she just ate it. The server was hanging out at the hostess station and talking with co-workers the entire time instead of bringing us our ketchup and water. The ONE time she finally asked if we needed anything else, I asked if I could finally have my water. We waited again for the ""to go"" chicken club I ordered while eating the burger. We left around 6:35. We only ordered 2 burgers and a chicken club & were there an hour and a half on a very slow night. The people behind us sat  after us, ate and left while we were still waiting and waiting, & they had appetizers as well!  Bill was 45$ only gave her a 5$ tip. I was frustrated.

We ordered drinks at the bar, which were good, but as soon as we waited over the 30 minute mark we went up to the group of hostesses and they basically started arguing with us while stating we'd have to wait another 30 minutes. Well, why didn't you tell us an hour so we wouldn't have spent our money on beer and wasted our time? Also, we called ahead so 30 minutes should have been around 30 minutes. We could have been served elsewhere by then. The one hostess even said we were being""unappreciative"" due to the rush and that even she was bussing tables. Ok, but that is your job? Honestly, you shouldn't be speaking to a customer like that anyways. I wish I could have provided a review on the food that I've been wanting to try, but the hostesses were so unprofessional that it turned me off of the place completely.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-allentown?start=100
Missy J.,"Macungie, PA",14,85,14,3.0,11/3/2016,"we have eaten here twice.  The first time, we had burgers, sandwiches, and a calamari appetizer. All were average.  The service was great both times. Food came slow,  but  don't blame that on the kitchen. Second visit, hostesses. sit us right by the door, even though it was the middle of the afternoon and there were plenty of better tables available.  My husband asked one of them if we could have another one, and he was told that we could just move ourselves wherever we wanted.  Really? There were 4 of them standing around chatting about school at the hostess stand, they couldn't be bothered to move us? Anyway, we picked out a good table for ourselves.  Kayla was our server, very bubbly and perky. She was on top of it. Our food took a long time, but it was good. Two sandwiches, Parmesan crusted chicken, and a large pizza. Overall, an average experience food wise, service from Kayla was better than average.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-allentown?start=100
Shelly P.,"Allentown, PA",0,2,,1.0,12/7/2016,"I had the most horrible experience that I've ever had at a restaurant.  I ordered the Caprese Piadina from the lunch menu.  It was delivered to the table and I took a bite only to realize that it was meat-based.  Maybe this wouldn't be a problem except that I am a vegetarian.  I felt sick to my stomach when I realized that there was meat in my sandwich.  While the manager was was very apologetic and offered to make sure I was served what I ordered, and comped both my meal and my companion's meal, this didn't make up for the mistake.  This also could have been a big problem if I didn't receive what I ordered and what I was served contained something I was allergic to.  I'm not sure how such a mistake was made, but more needs to be done to ensure this doesn't happen to anyone else.  While I was talking to the manager, my server, Emily, came to the table and was made aware of what happened.  She said, ""Oh, ok.""  I told her it isn't ok because I don't eat meat.  She said, ""I understand, I don't always eat chicken.""  She obviously didn't get it.  Then she stopped back at the table and asked if everything was ok.  Really?!  Of course everything wasn't ok.  She was so clueless and not sympathetic at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-allentown?start=100
