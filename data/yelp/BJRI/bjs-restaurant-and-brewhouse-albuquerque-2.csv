Lizz W.,"Rio Rancho, NM",0,12,10,2.0,7/5/2017,"Worst turkey burger ever! Service was super slow and the waiter didn't clear the plates when we were done, so there was a pile of dirty dishes during dessert.  Did I mention they weren't even busy?!

Ann Marie A.,"Albuquerque, NM",64,26,4,2.0,7/13/2017,Bleeeck.....worst food.  The prime rib dip had bones in it.  It looked nothing like the pretty picture on the menu.   Way too greasy....,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-2?start=20
J.E. V.,"Jacksonville, NC",39,36,31,4.0,5/7/2017,"All I can say is YES! The lunch specials rock... we had pizza and salad, the pizza crust was amazing! The jambalaya was something to rave about! The atmosphere was great and the service was great as well. We've been here twice in the past week it was just that good! The only issue I had was they brought my toddler out a cup of fruit and it looked really old and possibly the strawberries had mold... they quickly replaced it and all was well!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-2?start=20
Sandra C.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,4,,1.0,11/18/2017,"Third time I've  had horrible service and unacceptable wait times at BJ's.  Got there at 5:00 and we were told it would be a 15-20 minute wait.  Didn't get seated until 40 minutes later and then waited another hour for our food.  All five food orders and one of the drink orders were not what we ordered.  Got couscous instead of rice, mashed potatoes (which were cold) instead of baked, tomatoes on the kids' pizza (we specifically said no tomatoes), Pepsi instead of Dr. Pepper, etc.  The waiter got flustered when we brought it up and ended up sending the manager over who gave some lame excuse and ended up taking $10 off our bill.  Will never go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-2?start=20

Orlando C.,"Midtown/University, Albuquerque, NM",38,10,1,2.0,8/30/2017,"We got to the restaurant and was seated really fast. Our drinks came with in minutes of ordering. I had put in an order for cheese sticks, way over priced for what they serve. When we got them they were just cold like they were just sitting on a table. Our food was out in a good time however same issue cold food, I got a burger and fries and the hubby got a pizza. The burger was same but kinda thick and room temperature with cold fries. The pizza was cold also the only part that was hot was the center. At the end of the meal I order a new batch for of fries and they were the only thing that were hot when it came to the table.

This most recent time, I even made a ""reservation"" which turned out to be just call ahead and took 45+ minutes to get a table. Then the waitress was in way over her head and our food took a long time, as well. If you have a choice, go somewhere else.

Tosha B.,"Falls Church, VA",165,388,417,3.0,3/8/2016,"BJ's is a chain restaurant that is a step above a TGI Fridays, in a good way. My favorite things at BJ's are the beer and their dessert. I know this is a restaurant, but the food gets third place for me.  They brew their own beer which is a major plus and have a great variety of beers to choose from. I went with their IPA and really enjoyed the taste. It was hoppy, but not too hoppy and had a great finish. For dessert I went for the chocolate chip pizookie and was in heaven. It's a fresh baked chocolate chip cookie mini cake topped with vanilla ice cream. It comes out warm and it's delicious. You definitely want to save room for dessert and since the food isn't the best here, that's not a hard thing to do. Finally to the food.....I like that that have a large menu with many choices and even have gluten free options and light options. But the quality of the food isn't superb. It appears that a lot of their food is frozen. The food is ok, but don't fool yourself to think you're dining at a Michelin star restaurant. For a chain restaurant, this is a step above the rest and a great place to get good beer and dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-2?start=20
Jim C.,"Santa Fe, NM",16,165,,3.0,12/17/2016,"Meh. I ordered a s pellegrino and the server put the bottle on the table unopened- they require a bottle opener- and with no glass and hurried away.  The ribeye was tough but kind of ok. Not much taste to it for a Texan. Caesar Salad was just barely average.  I also had an asparagus salad but it was almost all greens with a few cranberries. I think it had a few sliced mushrooms, not sure what they were. No identifiable asparagus, though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-2?start=20

Anita H.,"Ojai, CA",0,1,,1.0,9/29/2017,We ordered food from here through grub hub. It was terrible.  My wife ordered the nachos and paid to have chicken added to them.  The chicken was missing.  You could tell they had been sitting for awhile they were not hot and also soggy.   Our drinks had melted ice in them and were sort of flat.  Again had obviously not been delivered promptly.  They forgot to add the ice cream to our monkey bread pazzoki.  We called Grubhub and they called the restaurant and they refused to refund our order or at least what we had paid for that was not delivered.  Grubhub however refunded it from their end so 5 stars to them.  Will never eat here again.  Either take out or in person,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-2?start=20

Every server I have encountered appears to have an attitude. The service is slow. Always sit at the bar if you want friendly and prompt service. Ive sat in a booth and wait for 20 minutes before a server even said hello.

Pretty much in the past 2 years since I've moved here, it's been bad lol But this review is based off tonight's service and food.  I came in with some friends and we were sat quickly. I ordered a margarita and it was one of the best I've had. I played it safe tonight and ordered the mozzarella cheese sticks and a soup and salad. Their wedge salad is the BEST! Our server was amazing. Really wish I could remember her name. Food and drinks came out very quickly. We ordered one of the cookies  to share for desert. It was yummy as always.

Sean D.,"Albuquerque, NM",61,19,5,2.0,9/18/2017,"This is my second time here. I went when they first opened and I really wasn't impressed enough to go back. I ended up getting a gift card for my birthday and figured the wife and I would use it for a date. Unfortunately our waiter I'm pretty sure was new. I won't hold it against him, I know it takes time to learn, it did however contribute to the overall experience.  We both ordered the prime rib special. My wife usually likes prime rib, it's not something I generally order. Salads came out first. Both salads tasted funny. I think the lettuce wasn't fresh. She ordered with ranch on the side and her salad was drenched in ranch. My Caesar was also drenched in dressing, it kind of hid the bad taste of the lettuce, so I guess that's a bonus.   Our plates came out, she noticed the prime rib was really rare looking. I kind of thought it did too, but I don't know what it's supposed to look like. We both got green beans and she got asparagus. The garlic green beans were almost inedible. I like spicy foods, but these were so spicy it was gross, not something I expected from green beans. Her asparagus was rubbery and no flavor. She didn't eat much of either.  I scarfed down the prime rib. I'll eat anything meat. My wife was struggling with hers. It was really chewy , probably was too rare, and she was frustrated. She ended up choking on a piece and I had to give her the heimlich in her seat. Out came a chunk of meat and saliva/water that she choked on, all over her meal. She was super embarrassed and that pretty much ruined her eating dinner. The waiter collected the plates and noted if she didn't like her meal. We both said yeah, but didn't really want to make issue of it since he seemed new.  He brought desserts. That was about the only thing keeping this from a 1 star review. I got the peanut butter s'mores pizookie and it was super good. After the wife calmed down from her panic and choking, she had a little also and at least got to enjoy something.  Overall I hope no one ever gives me another gift card here. Fool me three times won't happen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-2

Nick S.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,127,103,2.0,1/11/2018,"Probably the worst restaurant I've been to in the city. We were seated quickly but no one came over for over five minutes; the hostess just looked at us in a bored manner until we got up and addressed not being served. The manager seemed to care but, actions are louder than words. No discount or anything off the bill; which was fine whatever.

Diana H.,"Albuquerque, NM",141,76,136,4.0,6/18/2017,"UPDATE 6/17/17 - I returned here because the senior manager reached out to me regarding my previous review. I was offered 2 courtesy cards to return and dine at the establishment. Upon returning, Miguel made sure to greet us warmly, apologize for the mishap, and ensure that we would not run into further issues dining there. I ordered the ahi tuna poke this time, which was good, but more reminiscent of chopped tuna, and not so much like the real poke joints around town (doused in sauce, etc).  My boyfriend had the hickory BBQ brisket burger. This was really good and huge, so it was super filling.  For our free dessert, we opted with the monkey bread pizookie. By far, my absolute FAVORITE dessert at any chain restaurant. I'd come to to eat that alone if I didn't care so much about the calories! We even received a free pint glass and 20% VIP card for Father's Day during our visit. I'm impressed by how much BJ's actually cares about their customers, and whether or not they choose to return.

Rachel R.,"Dallas, TX",723,938,2737,3.0,12/29/2016,BJ's is a run of the mill chain eatery. They have standard food and above average beer. What they lack in originality they make up for with their pizookies.  Their lunches are reasonably priced and well portioned. They were under $10 and were extremely filling.  The pizookies are what is stand out. I tried the smores pizookie this time and loved the chocolate peanut butter and marshmallow combination.

Ashley G.,"Albuquerque, NM",207,183,2404,1.0,6/23/2017,"What the hell did I just eat? I ordered the Classic burger medium rare with sweet potato fries. It was the simplest dish in our entire to go order. I mean, the word CLASSIC is in the name, right? According to the menu, it should have mayonnaise as the sauce. Well, I'm pretty sure they used my buns to wipe up whatever sauce was spilled on the counter. Either that or they made my burger wrong and just kept remaking the same thing until it resembled the original thing. There was a small pat of Mayo with a large serving of some spicy orange tinged sauce and a spoonful of barbecue sauce on the other side. How does that even happen? I wiped it all off as much as possible because my father in law swears by their burgers and I didn't want to be the only one not eating. I tried to be a trooper but there was a reason I didn't order a cheeseburger. I HATE cheese and it really messes with my stomach. Halfway through my Frankenstein version of the classic burger, I bit into rolled up cheddar cheese. Seriously? And, of course, they made it medium well instead of medium rare despite my confirming it three separate times. They even wrote medium well on the container after all those confirmations.  I also ordered the sweet potato fries with it. These were actually worse than the burger! Each fry was burnt to a crisp and was hard to bite through. There was one fry that wasn't burnt and it actually tasted pretty good. Too bad the rest weren't edible. My recommendation? Red Robin just built a location next door. Or eat your shoe. It might have more flavor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-2

Steph R.,"Las Vegas, NV",21,60,23,2.0,3/12/2017,"This does not reflect the FIVE STAR service we received from Miguel, the manager. He really went out of his way to rectify the issue but unfortunately, his kindness and prompt service doesn't carry the whole restaurant.  It's my first review in Albuquerque, NM & unfortunately, it's not a positive one. We love BJ's & we come for the pizookies but we do enjoy all the other food as well!  We sat down around 7:15pm & waited for our server. We ordered our drinks & food all at once. The waters came out & our server never brought silverware. I'm not sure if people don't use their silverware for calamari, but we do. We also like to use the napkin that wraps silverware. We waited about 20-30 minutes to get our food. This is uncharacteristic for BJ's. Nobody filled up our waters while we waited or informed us that the kitchen was running behind or something. When we got our food, the calamari was cold & the ""guacamole"" we ordered had large chunks of avocado & was not mixed together adequately. The pizookie was delicious! Overall, It was a very disappointing experience. We tipped the waitress anyways. She's working for her money.

Morgan O.,"Albuquerque, NM",63,39,25,1.0,6/11/2017,"I don't even know where to begin with this review... literally... LITERALLY the worst dinner of my life with my family. So much so, that it started a fight between my family!  It's Sunday night about 7:30pm, and we were sat promptly by our hostess after about 5-8 minutes. The restaurant was really open, so they were just setting up a few tables for our group. We were waiting on my dad and my brother to show up, but we preceded to order drinks and an appetizer (an appetizer that never showed up).  Our waitress, Ariana, was prompt--at first-- but then proceeded to get slower and slower. She wasn't anymore busy than when we walked in, but was definitely giving more attention to the table behind us. They received drinks quicker from the bar and she checked on them more frequently. Then my mom's appetizer never arrived? I wasn't even aware of this until the end of our meal, but I'll return to that cluster-nightmare in a minute. Our medium sized group's order came out in sections. Large, separated sections of time between each delivery (not great for the food runners). Our waitress was no where to be found in the delivery of our food, so our orders lacked everything we asked for towards the meals. She never picked up plates promptly. In fact, still in the middle-end of dinner she began asking about dessert. We asked for a box and then three Pizookies for the table. I'm HIGHLY allergic to milk (specially that in ice cream and heavy creams) so I asked her if I could please get the ice cream on the side so I could give it to my husband or my brother instead. She said sure and then asked us how we'd all be paying (split check/single). I told her how to break it up and she walked away with an attitude. Didn't pick up empty plates, didn't ask for refills. She came back with our receipts instead, BEFORE dessert even came to the table. We weren't ready to pay yet, considering we were in the middle of everything and set them aside at least until the rest of our food arrived. Before she walked away again, I asked her for a box again--never received one, BUT I did see her walk all the way to the bar to grab a beer and bring it to the table behind us. Dessert arrived quickly, aaaand with ice cream on top. She, again, was no where to be found. The other waitress, who worked a separate section, delivered our desserts, so I asked her, ""I know this isn't your section, but would it be alright if I could ask for a box from you?"" She said a pleasant okay...and then never came back.... [internal thought: You gotta be kidding me at this point!] Finally, Ariana comes back and asks to pick up payment (again I asked for a box) and ask how the Pizookies were (in that order). We reply good and then my mom was so irritated at this point she began asking what's going on in the restaurant? [side note: my mom has worked in the service industry opening restaurants and training servers and staff around the US for over 20 years.] Just to receive some sort of explanation for her lack of initiative and overall wanting to be there and do her job, and whatever happened to the appetizer. She blamed the food runners and the kitchen staff, and then finally owned up to the error and apologized. So my mom gave her tips and let her know that if it's her staff then she's the one that's being affected and if she doesn't communicate that with her table it's then seen as solely her fault. She then made a finger gun and told me mom, ""Ya. I'll be sure to work on that."" I'm at a point where I'm so dumbfounded by her horrible behavior that I told my mom that she just needs to speak to a manager instead of telling someone who clearly doesn't want to work there. This is where the argument started within the family because my mom continue to tell me how there wasn't a manager that walked the floor once. I realized she was right.  Ariana was rude, defensive (although she had nothing to defend), and just wasn't pleasant to have as a waitress. She wouldn't refill anyone's drinks without us asking, she wouldn't pick up plates, she forgot food and extras, she never did anything with a smile or pleasant demeanor. I've never tipped below 20-30% EVER--even when we've had mediocre service in the past at places. I was a server once, I understand what tips mean, BUT that means I know what needs to go into earning a tip, Ariana overall didn't care.  So to sum up this incredibly awful night: 1. Terrible service 2. Food tasted good 3. No manager walking the floor 4. Don't expect refills 5. ...Or communication for that matter 6. To pay before your food arrives 7. Receive passive aggressive finger gun action Dear BJs, you're better than this.

I liked the dining area set up and how the bar is. All he staff seemed really nice. Our waiter checked on us way too much.. haha. However everything seemed clean and well kept.

This time I had one of the flatbread pizzas. Very light and satisfying. The desserts are also very good. They have many different options and they are good for sharing.  The only negative right now is there is a lot of construction going on around the restaurant so it can be a bit difficult to get in to the parking lot off of certain roads.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-2?start=40

Maria G.,"Charlotte, NC",232,200,567,3.0,11/5/2015,"BJ's is a box box chain restaurant. It is average. You wont leave hungry but you might leave with indigestion. I have been here twice and I've found the service average since there seem to be too many tables per waitress/waiter. If you aren't ordering beer you seem to get worse service. The bar area is seat yourself and the last time I was there it took 10 minutes from someone to clear the ONLY table that was open.  The food is pretty good but is completely predictable. Yes, the pictures look almost exactly like the food. How does that happen? Well, it goes back to the ultra chain restaurant theme. If you look up the calorie counts on this one, be ready to lace up your running shoes.  I do really like the interior. It doesn't match the ""bar"" theme at all but it does make the joint feel a bit up-classed. The ladies room has some really nice finishes that I'd borrow if I owned a modern style house.  Overall, if you are looking for a spot to watch a game, this one is okay.

Had to wait about 10-15 minutes before asking again for a table. Our waitress took our order and then promptly disappeared and paid more attention to a larger party she had. We waited about 35-40 minutes for the food and she said it would be right out. She brought two other plates of food except mine and said she had forgotten to put the order for the pizza in. A manager was called over to put the order in and came back with a complimentary salad. Again, more waiting. The pizza then arrived. As the waitress was refilling our drinks, she knocked over a glass of water and flooded the table. Then we had a coupon for a free pizookie, but we said with the ice cream on the side because one member of our party is severely lactose intolerant (to the point of having to visit a hospital).

Moved into the food and both my wife and i got the soup and salad and there is nothing interesting about it. Broccoli and chedder soup should have those little chunks of broccoli however it tasted like melted cheese with broccoli seasoning.

The service is much better in there but I think because it's a smaller area. Drinks were good and I decided on ribs. They were okay but nothing fabulous. The BBQ sauce leaves a lot to be desired.  The third visit was with a bunch of friends for a birthday party. There was about 30 of us. Service was actually better with 30 people than the service we had with just two of us on our first visit. There were two servers for our table and they did great. We all ordered food and drinks. I decided to try the flatbread pizza. Wow, that was a disappointment. It reminded me of a frozen pizza rolled flat. It didn't taste fresh or that good.  So the old adage ""three strikes you're out"" holds true here. We gave it a go three times and that's it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-2?start=80

Howie K.,"Albuquerque, NM",3293,1194,3461,2.0,4/3/2014,"It's difficult to dog this franchise on craft passion. Most likely the numero uno quality I look for in any brew operation is commitment to craft, and judging from the tableside promotional materials I peeked, BJ's is all about educating the masses on the art of microbrews, they offer classes and presentations to prove it. Nationwide, this crafty thang is definitely catching fire, many smallish operations are attempting to claim the mantle of hybrid national/local beer wizardry. In ABQ, our first introduction to this movement is BJ's. And the beer speaks volumes: major corporate takeover.  The varietals ain't altogether bad, per se, but they sip like the set-up for a really bad joke: ""So this Anheuser-Busch rep walks into a micro-brewery..."" You know the punchline, it has something to do with firing the brewmaster. I didn't mess around, I went straight for some challenging pours, the Abbey Normal and Grand Cru. The color and ABV levels matched my expectations, but the flavors were barely discernible. Same went for the wife's porter and nut brown. And way too carbonated. These people should not be educating the public on this art. And when that Anheuser-Busch rep from my little joke scoured the menu of the little brew pub, he/she also decided to scrap anything remotely flavorful. Thus, the eats here are a snore. Such a shame. Like the suds, these plates (the few we tried: pizza, mahi-mahi, ahi tuna salad) were really flat, closely resembling some of America's champion franchise outfits (think Applebees, TGIF). So you're getting fizzy, empty beer and flavorless plates and probably waiting 20 minutes for a table on a Sunday night (we did). Sound like fun? By all means, avoid our stellar local breweries and dull your tongue at BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-2?start=80

Craig E.,"Corrales, NM",27,35,7,1.0,3/31/2015,"I ate lunch here with my wife and youngest son.  BJ's is the worst kind of chain restaurant:  A big impressive design that lures in customers only to empty their wallets on thoughtless food and slow, indifferent service.  We experienced hour of wait time and a very un-attentive waiter that got our order wrong.  The food was totally disappointing - its not worth my time to describe, but the recipes are just wrong.  Yuck.  We won't be back.  I hate to give negative reviews, and I do't do it lightly, but judging from how inconsistent the other reviews are, I think its safe to conclude that providing customers with excellent food and service is not the corporate mission at BJ's.  Even it is, it isn't.  The beer may be good, but its good at other places too. So why go here?  Albuquerque has a bunch of excellent local tap rooms now.   For example: Nexus - great southern food and fine beer. Il Vicino tap room - good sandwiches, beer, and a fun industrial decor. Others include Turtle Mountain, Marble tap room, Boxing Bear, Tractor Brewing, Bosque Brewing tap room. If you must do chain restaurants, a better alternative is Rock & Brews - good food and a fun environment for friends and kids (play structure!).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-2?start=80

Callista W.,"Albuquerque, NM",21,37,28,4.0,4/20/2016,"My favorite dish to get at BJ's, for some reason, is the spaghetti and meatballs. I find their recipe for it delicious! It seems like a weird thing to enjoy the most at a brewhouse for reasons unknown to me, but that's my go-to food there now. I've also enjoyed their fish and chips. I would advise against getting the chicken fried steak--unless they have vastly changed the meat they use and how they cook it, I'd say it was one of the worst chicken fried steaks I've had. It was so chewy that it hurt my jaw a little to work on that! And it didn't taste amazing. But, this being said, I cannot get enough of the spaghetti! The meatballs are really tasty...it's one of the few entrees where, if I'm hungry enough when I go, I'll eat all of it (totally did this the other night!). Also, I adore their stout. I love the nitro feel it has--so smooth, it almost seems creamy. It's a nice dessert beer--goes well with their also-delicious pizookies. Their brown ale is also delightful. Easy to drink and has a nice flavor. The service has been hit-or-miss here. One night, I went with my hubby and we ended up waiting for service for about 20 minutes--the girl who was supposed to be serving us...forgot us or something? It was weird, since we were sitting the middle of the room, so it's not like we were hidden in a corner somewhere! And there was another time when we had a server who seemed to forget us. But there have been other times when the service has been fine. Last time we went, we had a perfectly nice server with helpful menu suggestions.  I like the atmosphere. It's a big restaurant--lots of space, but the tables are private enough that no one interferes with anyone else's time there. In summary, I'd definitely come here again.

The pizza was thin and good, but nothing extraordinary. The Sampler Platter offers all the fried foods, southwest eggroll wraps, mozarella sticks, avocado egg rolls, and spinach cheese dip. The only thing that stood out was the Avocado egg rolls, they were really good. Everything else was pretty standard.  For the price...maybe I expected better.

I am not a fan of chains in the first place, but some folks we know had enjoyed their visit here, and my husband's employee chose this place for their monthly beer night out.  So, I joined them with an open mind. Right off the bat, parking sucked.  There are about ten spots right next to the restaurant, and the rest are set back in a mall lot, and you have to walk across an internal lot road to get there.  It was light when I went, but at night that could be really dangerous.   The staff who greeted me were clueless about my group, so I found them on my own.  The place is huge, but it was only about half full so it was fine. I sat with my husband and his folks (on a VERY wobbly chair) and had a beer and some appetizers.  The beer is not bad - the group pretty much agreed on that.  The Red, I think, was the general favorite, and I think on a second trip I had the amber.  (Not my choice - we saw a movie as a group and that's where everyone wanted to go...) The food was pretentious, not great, and expensive.  Haven't had a full meal there, but I won't bother.  They seem to have decided that if the beer is worth drinking, they don't need to put much effort into the food, preferring instead to just slide out the same corporate dreck everyone else does. There are so many great restaurants in Albuquerque, I really don't understand how places like this survive.  I guess there has to be a place for people who just want to eat and don't care about the food, but I prefer to enjoy the food I eat.

Tony M.,"Albuquerque, NM",624,506,94,1.0,5/4/2013,I had seen the restaurant for some time and thought I would finally try it out.  I will say that it was a mistake.  The server was condescending and walked away to get water before I could order.  When he finally came back to the table I gave him the order and he wrote half of it down.   When the salad arrived it had dressing all over it and I had asked for dressing on the side.  It was delivered by someone else.  When the sandwich arrived it was all wrong.  I asked to speak to the manager and it took him a while to come to the table.  When I explained what had gone wrong the manger said I had two options he would take it off the ticket or remake it.  I told him I needed dinner so he remade the sandwich and the second time it was correct. Through all this issue the server avoided our table and only came by after I had finished the sandwich never refilled drinks.  I never got an apology from either the server or the manager for the poor service or the mistake.  I did mention to him that it was the first time in the restaurant and didn't care.  I personally would not recommend going here and will only go back if someone else is paying for it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-2?start=100

I am a dessert connoisseur, and it's no French trained creation, but for a restaurant such as this they're damn good. Other than that they don't really stand out from other chains. If you like beer they have a great selection, if you like craft beer, you're better off somewhere local. Their own brews are mediocre at best, however they do carry an assortment of some pretty decent beer from other parts of the country/world. I can't say anything about the entrees, haven't ever eaten a meal here.  I can however say the service isn't terrible. We had a table of about 30 and they did well given it was already a very busy Saturday night. With that being said I know from others experience they're great for groups in general.

Scott M.,"Albuquerque, NM",32,181,136,5.0,6/28/2014,"Reading the reviews of this place I conclude that local YELP-ers find it hip to trash franchises.  Let me tell you why you shouldn't jump to such a conclusion with BJ's.  First, they have a huge selection if beer ... Yes, BEER! ... 23 on tap, 23 bottles and 11 varieties the franchise brews themselves. If beer is not your thing they have plenty of wine and cocktails that'll meet your needs.  Second, BJ's has a wide variety of food (appetizers, entrees, desserts) and the food is very good ... good portions, great flavors, nice presentation.  In their 16-page menu you'll find Pizzas, Wings, Burgers, Salads, Sandwiches, Streaks, Pasta dishes, and Soups.  Third, there are those extras that make the experience worthwhile: Ample and very comfortable seating (booths, tables, bar tables and bar seating), high ceilings, cool murals, Vegas-inspired lounge lighting, cloth napkins, industrial designs and 80s music.  They also have a spectacular bar with a visually appealing backdrop of backlit liquor bottles and a super-sized central TV (1 large and 3 sub screens).  There are also at least 3 other large flat screen high definition TVs that play sports.  BJ's has friendly servers (I've been here three times with no problems whatsoever).  There is also lots of parking.  They are close to the new Regal Cinema theaters and close to shopping (ABQ uptown, Target, Winrock. Mall - soon to be ABQ's newest outdoor mall).  Check it out and tell me if I'm wrong.  P.S.

Jason O.,"Albuquerque, NM",2,5,,1.0,5/30/2014,"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me three  times shame on me!  For some reason we keep going back to this location hoping that service and food have been improved upon.  Nope.   So we went tonight after watching a movie because at 10:30pm there aren't a lot of options for dining.  We were starving, dizzy with food pangs. Right away I knew it wasn't going to go well because the hostess didn't feel like greeting with words: as if we were led to our table by a girl that tragically lost her parents in a plane crash and became mute ever since.  No need to make us feel welcome because we're only there to eat and contribute to your paycheck.   We sat for a little while waiting for our server.  He came by and dropped off water.  No introduction, no name, no time.  Just ready to take our order.  And here's what we got: Avocado egg-rolls CHICKEN potstickers Balsamic glazed chicken Chicken Thai Mango Salad Avocado egg-rolls - definitely came frozen.  You can tell when a frozen egg-roll is immediately deep fried then served its rubbery inside...plus the sever from a previous visit told us it was frozen.  Also I saw no actual avocado, it was more like guacamole. Rubbery nasty guacamole rolls. CHICKEN potstickers - Chicken is in all caps because when I took a bite it tasted more like ground beef.  My wife made the mistake of eating a whole potsticker and was queazy the rest of the night.  These were also from frozen.  Most definitely the worst potsticker I have ever tried in the history of my life.  I've bought frozen potstickers from the store that were better than this.  Also, we found it funny that there was an unnecessary little mound of shredded carrot in the center of the plate...like the chef thought that would look fancy.   Balsamic glazed chicken - there was no glazing done here.  They took a squeeze bottle and tried to be fancy with some kind of balsamic syrup (looked like chocolate syrup) passing it over chicken and mashed potatoes alike. The chicken...most likely from frozen.  The mashed potatoes tasted like they came from Furr's Cafeteria. Whats really weird about the presentation is that there were fried onions over top of the mashed potatoes but then there was a pile of sautéed onions near the chicken. Pick one!  No need for two versions of onion on one plate.   Chicken Thai Mango Salad - this wasn't bad.  I actually ate the whole thing.  The only issue I would have with this is that there isn't anything Thai about it.  It had a dry rub of a Cajun/asian fusion blend of spices generously sprinkled over the lettuce.  At least it had fresh avocado slices on top! Hmm,  I remember coming in with my son before asking for sliced avocado for him and they told me they don't have avocado except in the egg-rolls...liars.   Overall it was just a bad experience all around.  The only reason I gave it one star was because of the avocado slices.   I don't blame the staff, I blame the management for not checking quality and hiring incompetent employees (especially in the kitchen).  I've been to other Bj's and the chain is actually pretty good. Its just this location that sucks.  Corporate needs to go in and clean house.   Seriously.  My wife and I have been to this location three times over a period of three years and the only thing consistent is the terrible food and crappy service.  I've never sent food back, EVER, until this place.  How can you mess up cooking salmon three times in a row!!?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-2?start=100

Chris C.,"Albuquerque, NM",29,8,9,2.0,5/28/2014,"For a chain this one had so much promise. After a long day in the office that killed what little desire I had to cook, we needed something nearby that would please the whole family. I'm not one for chains to begin with, but I had never been to BJ's and I had heard some good feedback on the place so we gave it a go.  It was beautiful night, so we hit up the patio. The place had great ambiance and the patio was comfy and inviting. The service however was slow and indifferent. Seemed to be one server on the patio,  so I cut him some slack.  I love craft beer, so I wasn't expecting to much out of the house brews (they did have some locals and regionals on tap and I give them credit for that).  I had the hoppy scotsman and my wife the blonde. Nothing to write home about but solid drinkable beers. Unfortunately, my glass wasn't quite clean. We'll pretend it's residue from the head. It took me long enough to get the beer, and I wasn't about to part with it for a clean glass.  On to dinner. The food took a while, but we were enjoying the patio. When our plates arrived however, my Mahi tacos were shrimp tacos (the server had even asked if I wanted my Mahi grilled or fried).  I'm pretty easygoing, so shrimp tacos it is. Then the last straw, whether the shrimp was cooked through was suspect. While I like my steak and my fish medium, I don't think it's a safe way to eat your shellfish. My Mahi taco turned shrimp taco quickly became a slaw taco.  Maybe it was a bad night in the restaurant, but subpar service, dirty glassware, an incorrect order, and undercooked food leaves me without a compelling reason to return.

Ania A.,"Greenville, SC",204,100,77,4.0,3/4/2013,"BJ's is a chain. That being said, some people will cringe as soon as they walk in and run right out, and some will have faith that since this place IS a chain, there must be something good about it for it to remain successful. The good: The menu is MASSIVE. This is a place to go when you're with a bunch of picky people--mom wants pasta and dad wants steak and kid brother wants nothing but mac and cheese... BJ's will set you up. They've also got a whole slew of specialty pizzas (personal sizes, too), and they're quite tasty. BJ's is also a brewpub, so they have their own line of beers. If you're into sampling microbrews, you'll be happy doing it here.  The ordinary: A chain is a chain is a chain. This place is nice inside, but you'd be hard pressed to say it has charm. It's popular, so the wait can be long, and the service is pretty much what you'd expect at a Chili's or a TGIFriday's or those sorts of spots--not fantastic, but typical of a big, busy joint.  Overall, we like BJ's simply because they have so much selection, and we're fans of choice. And the Ahi Poke appetizer is fantastic. If you're in the neighborhood, check it out.

Dustin M.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,5,,1.0,4/2/2013,"Let's start off with the fact the I created this account just to review BJ's after my experience last night with my gf.  I had been here once before with my parents to celebrate their birthdays.  I had never been to a BJ's prior and had never heard of them.   My experience can be summed up in one word: Bland.  The food is just horribly bland. I had the fish and chips and my gf had spaghetti and meat balls with meat sauce.  First the fish and chips.  The fish was extremely bland.  It seemed like I was eating some mushy white meat with no flavor at all.  Also, the batter they use is pretty nasty.   Whatever they are using comes out like a lava rock; great for storing all the frier oil.  Seriously, the fish was so oily my stomach was really upset at me after we left.  The fries I ordered were thin cut.  They were so thin they would snap right in two when dipping them into ketchup or even just trying to lift them to your mouth.   If you want good fish and chips try O'Neills.  They are basically my benchmark now for fish and chips.  BJ's comes no where close on this dish. Next the spaghetti.  It wasn't actually spaghetti but one of the thinner types of noodles.  Again, very very bland.  The sauce was okay, but  I could tell that it had not been cooked with wine.  Maybe this is just a personal preference. On the way home my gf and I joked about throwing up the food we just ate to go home and cook a proper dinner.  Seriously.  Root beer was ok but nothing at all compared to Il Vicino. In fact all of their handcrafted soda's are nothing worth writing home about.  The cherry soda was so sweet is was practically undrinkable.  In fact the same would have to be said about their beers; nothing special and nothing worth going out of your way over.

The menu is enormous--something (*mediocre*) for everyone. It's as if they took the ""jack of all trades, master of none"" approach.

We didn't even stay long enough to try the food, much less the beer. My husband and I wanted to try this place out on a Saturday night. When we arrived, the waiting area was packed, which is understandable since it was a Saturday evening, AND a brand new restaurant. We had a movie to catch, so we decided not to dine there, since we were told it would be about a 40 minute wait. We decided to go on Sunday afternoon for lunch, and possibly watch some football. Again, there was a 20 minute wait, which was fine with us. They gave us our pager, and we sat in the waiting area... Waiting, waiting, and waiting. After our twenty minutes was up, I asked the hostess how much longer the wait would be. She took my pager and pressed some buttons on her computer screen, and told me there was a party of 2 ahead of us.  I sat back down and noticed a couple that had come in way after us, had their pager blinking! I was about to say something but then our pager began to go off, so I figured I would just let it go. We finally got seated after a 40 minute wait... There was a family next to us who I had noticed in the waiting room (I am very observant I guess). They probably were seated 15 minutes before us, and they had no drinks or anything on their table. My husband and I waited for a out 10 minutes when he flagged down the manager who was the least bit concerned about these 2 tables that haven't been helped yet. My husband asked where our server was, and the manager came back telling us she was getting our drinks, then walked off. Uh, excuse me but we hadn't ordered any drinks because our server was nowhere to be found! Anyway, after another 10 minutes, we decided to leave. As we were leaving, the manager passed by us again and my husband said, ""you have another free table."" The manager told us he would give us a gift card, we said no, and I proceeded to tell the manager about our 1 hour long wait, and what a complete waste of time this experience was. We started walking out again, then the manager GRABBED my husband's arm, and told him he would give us a free appetizer. My husband looked at me, and I said, ""Hell NO.""

Clayton A.,"Albuquerque, NM",146,667,450,3.0,1/7/2013,"BJ's is one of the highly capitalistic enterprises that saw a growing movement and devised a way to cheapen it and dumb it down for the clueless American masses. As smaller breweries have slowly chipped away at the stronghold that Bud, Coors and Miller have on the American beer market, many a drinker has shunned the Big 3 (oh, the ruff life). BJ's clearly recognized this and swooped in to steal as much of a share that the big guys are losing as is possible. While this may be good from a business standpoint and has brought them obvious success, it's certainly not good for creating a great atmosphere or something they've done for the love of beer.  First off, when I walked in on a Saturday hoping to catch the NFL playoffs and sip a beer at the bar, I wasn't prepared for the mayhem I'd find inside. The place was packed beyond belief and people were scurrying every direction like a Bronx crackhouse. Miraculously, I found a seat at the bar and received some attention after about 5 minutes of scrutinizing the novel-length menu (always a major pet peeve of mine). The waiters were friendly enough and allowed me to sample a few beers, but they were too busy for their own good and not the type of servers you'd want in a place calling itself a brewhouse since they had neither the time nor the knowledge to speak on the beers they were serving. This bothered me but I got over it.  I must concede that the beer selection wasn't horrible and the one BJ's brew I tried, the Imperial Stout, surpassed my very low expectations and turned out to be good. Also, a happy hour was in effect so my two pints cost me $9. Not bad. Plus, I'd probably come back to try the pizzas that apparently are what BJ's originally became famed for and on Saturday evenings sell at half-price.

Drinks took a long time to get to us. We started with ""traditional buffalo wings."" They're not really traditional AT ALL. They are breaded and deep friend served dry with a bowl of buffalo sauce to dip them in on the side. Traditional buffalo wings are served tossed in butter and buffalo hot sauce. The bowl of sauce had no butter so it tasted weird.  I was still hungry so we ordered a small deep dish pepperoni pizza. Well, I wasn't expecting it, but their pizza doesn't have sauce on it! None! It was basically glorified cheese bread with chopped tomatoes on top and a few pepperoni thrown on for appearances. *sigh* So disappointing.

They failed.  Okay, now on to the beer... What can I say?

Susan G.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,8,,2.0,6/23/2016,"We've had a couple of great meals at the Cottonwood Mall location and stopped in at this one expecting it to be the same. I'm not sure if we just hit on a bad night or if there is drastically different management at the two locations, but it really wasn't a good experience. It started with a server who made it perfectly clear that she would rather be doing anything else than waiting tables. She had no personality whatsoever, didn't smile once the entire evening, and did the bare minimum. She was also painfully slow--like 10 minutes between asking for something and actually getting it--and she didn't appear to be particularly busy. We aren't demanding customers and are typically good tippers (absolute minimum 15% and 20-25% if the service is good), but this gal was one of those extremely rare 10% recipients. We've previously ordered burgers, salads, and calamari and all were excellent. My husband had a burger and it was comparable to the previous ones. I ordered the Chicken/Bacon/Sriracha Mac and Cheese thinking ""how could I go wrong with that combo?"" After a few minutes, a manager came over and informed us that they had run out and were having to make a new batch from scratch so it was going to take awhile. No problem. We finally got our meals, a LONG time later, delivered by another server. The one time our waitress was prompt, she came over to see how we liked it before we had even gotten a good taste (my husband hadn't even finished dressing his burger). After a few bites, I noticed that the chicken, bacon, broccoli, and pasta were all cooked perfectly (kudos, that's not easy), but the sauce that someone took forever to whip up from scratch tasted remarkably like it came from a Velveeta Shells 'n Cheese box with not even a hint of Sriracha flavor.  I picked around at it for awhile and decided to save it for lunch the next day--adding some of my own Sriracha definitely helped, but it still had an overpowering fake cheese flavor. We had wanted to try the Pizzookie on previous visits but had always been too full. Since I hadn't eaten most of my dinner, it seemed like a good time to go for it. We got the chocolate chunk and it was pretty good. No complaints, but I wouldn't order it again because for that much money and calories, it should be awesome. We will go back to the Cottonwood Mall location and probably stick to the menu items that we know are good. However, I don't think we'll chance this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-2?start=180

This place was really busy right at 11am, but then this is the opening week. They have a large menu (not Cheesecake Factory big, but approaching that kind of size!) and so there are lots to choose from (pizza, salads, seafood, pork, steak, sando's) and we were told about the lunch menu (which has smaller plates). I had the Mahi Mahi (from the regular menu - as that is available all day) and it comes with a stir fried rice with pineapple and peppers.  My friend had the lunch pizza and salad. I liked my dish (it is only about 575 calories - which was nice) the fish may have been a tad overcooked, but the rice was very tasty indeed, I this dish would be greatly improved if they gave you a side of teriyaki sauce or just something to help moisten the fish. The salad and pizza didn't look as great (the lettuce looked like something from a grocery store ""pre-bagged"" salad) an then a tiny sprinkle of shredded carrot - it just really didn't look that appetizing. The personal pizza was about 5"" across and was their ""Chicago style"" which seems to mean here that is massive dough and little toppings - I really like Chicago Deep Dish pizza and to me that is like a pie crust with a whole lot of toppings (and I have eaten this twice in Chicago to be kind of sure!) - both Pizza 9 and now BJ's seem to go with ""deep crust"" and as I am not a huge crust fan I am just a little disappointed.

Laura H.,"Rio Rancho, NM",3,4,,1.0,1/31/2015,My best friend brought me here the first time to try a dessert called a beignet I was so excited to try it . When we got there we didn't have to wait to be seated so that was good ! We got seated and the hostess told us our waiter would be with us shortly we waited for about 15 minutes and no one came by to take our drink order so we finally decided to wave down a waiter and by that time we were ready to place our order but he took our drink order first the guy never came back so we decided it was time to leave and give another establishment our money ! Hint hint waiters!!! We asked to speak with the manager and he was very apologetic and said they want us to give them another chance he gave us a gift card and we left  My second visit was again with my bestie ! Again we didn't wait to be seated and again we went after having a delicious meal somewhere else we went to bjs for that dessert ! Again it took a long time to get our drinks I ordered coffee and when the waitress took our order just to come back and tell us they had run out of the beignet so we had to pick something else even though my heart was set on having that French donut ! Service wasn't that good the waitress was nice but she took forever to check on us that might of affected what we ended up tipping her BYW we would see a cluster of waiters and waitresses hanging out by the register pretending not to see us when we wanted to get their attention and our waitress was who knows where ! We didn't complain this time  Third visit  I was treating my bestie out to dinner her choice to go to this place ! It was her day we were excited and celebrating her promotion ! Same type of service ! Waited forever for drinks waitress looked friendly but ended not being so kind we ordered a large tomato and cheese pizza  When we got our pizza it looked like something was missing it was the tomatoes so we told our waitress the pizza was missing the tomatoes and she says oh I know and took the pizza back and ten minutes  later our pizza was ready ok good !! We had to ask for Parmesan she didn't offer it and when she brought it she slammed it on the table like we weren't as important as her other tables she didn't ask if we needed anything else my friend and I looked at each other in disbelief  We decided to ignore it until we saw a manager walking the floor asking customers how everything was and he totally by passed our table WHat the heck!! I even opened my yelp app on my phone so maybe he can see that this experience was going on yelp ! Nope didn't work!!! my plan to get good quality service failed !! On the flip side I finally had the soo anticipated dessert it was delicious but not delicious enough to go back again! We asked our waitress to get the manager so we can have a word with him! He was apologetic and said he appreciated us and they need feedback from us to make things better unfortunately I will not dine there again manager took care of our bill which was not needed it was nice of him the food was good service bad !!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-2?start=160

Lisa R.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,4,,1.0,8/9/2015,"Ugh, My boyfriend and I went in late Tuesday eve and he waited 25 minutes for his first beer on tap with no explanation or offer within that time to change his beer order. Waitress only avoided our table during that time. Then, when said beer came out her explanation was something about the hoses, I don't know or care I'm not a bartender but with no acknowledgment it was unacceptable, she just avoided our table during the 25 minute wait. I then asked to speak to the manager who was just as unprofessional in his mannerisms and speaking skills and went through the same explanation with no acknowledgment that waiting 25 minutes wasn't cool ""lemme buy you a beer "" at the very least. Then once our soggy avocado eggrolls came out I had to ask the waitress for a napkin and was given two cocktail napkins, really wow ?? I then called her back, thinking she would've brought set ups earlier, and asked her for two BIG napkins and two forks, feeling like I was making a request to my boyfriends four-year-old son...what a mistake will not go back. When leaving I needed to use the ladies room, thank goodness or I would've lost my appetite as two toilets were backed up, icky stuff on the counter tops with both trashes overflowing. In Albuquerque I will stick with Applebee's who at least takes care of the customer when they do screw up so that you keep coming back. And the waitresses know that when you have food you need a napkin and a fork. I have eaten at this chain in California and know  it's good but this location needs to get it together, hopefully it was just a bad night but after reading the other comments probably need a new manager.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-2?start=200

There were multiple other waitresses standing around but did not seem too interesting in helping. The manager (my assumption based on his dress and mannerisms with the employees) never made an attempt to help or visit with his customers even after witnessing our dissatisfaction with our meals. In the time we were there, we noticed another customer get up and ask the bartender for plates so he and his wife could eat their appetizer. Another family requested to be moved to the regular seating because service seemed quicker. Over the worst experience at a restaurant. The worse part is that the waitress didn't seem to care!

I ordered a mini deep dish pizza with pepperoni.  I thought it was nice.  Perfect temperature, right amount of sauce (some may call it dry, but I love half sauce on my pizzas and I didn't have to order it that way).  Other people who had more toppings on their pizzas stated they were good as well. I will be going back if I need a standard restaurant for groups of people.  Nothing special, but just a place to hang out, get a bite to eat and chat.
