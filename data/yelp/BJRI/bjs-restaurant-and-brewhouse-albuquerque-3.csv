Veronica S.,"Albuquerque, NM",24,23,22,5.0,10/11/2017,"The food at BJ's is great. We had been to BJ's in Oxnard, CA years ago and didn't know what to expect as far as food and service in this location. The service was great. The food was delicious.  I took my 4 kids out for lunch and they were all quite pleased with their food. The Kids menu is thoughtful of kids' preferences. Many kids' menus do not offer anything but chicken fingers and fries. I appreciate establishment that take kids into consideration. My 9-year-old could not finish his chicken alfredo with broccoli, so he took the rest home. The kids meals are a pretty good size. We topped off our full tummies with a Churro Pizzookie.  The Churros were terrible, but the ice cream was great. We'll try a different pizzookie next time. We will definitely be back. Thanks for a great experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-3
Miranda M.,"Los Angeles, CA",62,7,,1.0,7/26/2017,"My husband and I just escaped from this BJ's, he ordered a beer which took an unreasonable amount of time to pour. When he received it, it was ~80% full. After complaining, the second beer came 85% full.  It seemed like there was only one server working the whole restaurant.  We had to listen to a bus boy flirt with the table next to us for several minutes, as several other (maybe?) servers and helpers walked by completely blind to customers who had had payments waiting for 10+ minutes. My husband's burger was cooked into a hockey puck.  They didn't get either of our orders correct. We even had a camaraderie with the table next to us about how bad the service was.  We had to wait so long for the check we were on the fence about a fine and dash.  Worst restaurant experience in recent memory, never going again. If I could give it 0 stars I would.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-3
Adam B.,"Albuquerque, NM",9,69,8,3.0,1/5/2018,This place is hit and miss. Both in terms of customer service and food quality.  I stayed from burgers once and won't do it again.  Good kid's meals.  Excellent root beer.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-3
Trish R.,"Albuquerque, NM",33,4,1,2.0,1/6/2018,While I enjoyed the environment & servers I can't say the same for the food. I've been there twice & both times received under cooked (raw) chicken.

Bruce H.,"Albuquerque, NM",4,28,,4.0,12/21/2017,"Really good food at a reasonable price. I had the quinoa shrimp and it was fabulous. Lots of shrimp and tasty quinoa, arugula and tomato in a light garlic sauce. My companion had spaghetti and meatballs (something I would not have thought to order here) and she said it was very good, although way too much for one sitting. (She took at least half home.) They also have a very good selection of craft beers on tap at very reasonable prices. I had the Lightswitch Lager - excellent. The waiter was attentive but not intrusive. I hadn't been here in quite a while and I had forgotten how good it is. Now I'd like to return again soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-3
Barbara E.,"Roseville, CA",0,28,16,2.0,10/9/2017,I was so hungry after starting the day super early ballooning at the International Hot Air Balloon Festival. Stopped by to pick up dinner on the way home and ordered small pizza and roasted Brussels sprouts which I e had before at a number of Bj's and we're absolutely delicious. This was what I found when I opened my to go box at the hotel. Major bummer. Will definitely think twice next time I need to grab dinner somewhere. :-(,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-3
Iara M.,"Rio Rancho, NM",6,21,53,4.0,11/13/2016,"Went to BJ's on Veterans Day (Friday) with husband for a late lunch.  The place was packed and even though it was a holiday, the service was friendly and fast.  Husband had the Late Night burger and I had Bacon Cheeseburger. Both were delicious and very juicy.  We also ordered beers. Husband had Blonde and I had PM Porter. And that's the reason I am not going to give 5 stars to this place.  My husband's beer was ok but mine, OMG, it was completely flat, like it was the left over from the keg. I couldn't drink it. I told our waitress about the problem with the beer and she promptly solved the problem, asking me what kind of beer I would like and chose the same as my husband. And they didn't charge the ""bad"" beer. I would definitely return there and recommend to my friends and family.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-3
Steph R.,"Las Vegas, NV",21,60,23,5.0,3/13/2017,"My my my..... BJ's, DONE RIGHT!  We decided to have BJ's tonight again, because we really wanted it & was it the worst decision of my life??? I THINK NOT! It was a wonderful experience!!  As soon as we sat down, Vince (our server) greeted us with coasters AND silverware roll ups. We ordered calamari, it came out swift & fresh. Vince let us know about the Monday night pizza special, we got the chicken bacon ranch deep dish. We got our deep dish faster tonight than we did last night when we ordered chips/guacamole & Calamari. The pizza was excellent. Lastly, the pizooki did not disappoint! (It never does) :-)  We sat in the bar. It was getting fairly busy. About halfway full & Vince seemed to be the only server in the bar area yet he did not miss a thing.  Food and service was phenomenal tonight, in true BJ's fashion.

Jordan F.,"Albuquerque, NM",195,53,38,5.0,4/9/2017,"We had to wait about an hour for our table, but the food, dessert, and service definitely made up for it. As we were waiting for our table, the manager gave us sample of pizza in the lobby which was a nice gesture. Our server was very attentive and suggested a dessert that forever changed our lives. It was a super sized pizzookie that had all of our favorite things. This item is not on the menu, but man is it worth every penny.

Tania S.,"Albuquerque, NM",218,624,1495,3.0,3/28/2017,"(3.5) BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse is pricey chain food, but delicious eats! Was here on St. Patty's Day for green beer! Daniel at the bar was very kind and prompt with service. Made sure we were taken care of and made some recommendations through dinner this night.  If you frequent, their app is a fun add for rewards and the like. I recall eating for far less in my high school days, but isn't that the case everywhere else now? I wish they had more local beers on tap, but my most favorite is their house Tatonka Stout. Give them a try if you haven't.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-3
Sammie L.,"Albuquerque, NM",5,95,2,2.0,1/8/2017,"I am a fan of BJs, and we normally go to the uptown location, but we decided to come here for dinner with friends. I was so disappointed. The snobby hostess should have been our first warning that the place was going to be a disappointment. I guess she believes that smiling will give her crow's feet, so she opts for the stick-up-her-ass look instead. The guy who sat us shared her same demeanor. Our server was pleasant, although, he was very forgetful numerous times.  The food was equally disappointing. Our friends ordered spaghetti for their three-year-old, and it came drenched with basil. Who the heck decided that putting tiny pieces of herbs in a kid's dish would be a good idea? So, our poor friend was picking them out one by one. Veggies or herbs should not be included in a kid's dish. I'm pretty sure the veggies on my vegetarian pizza were rancid. It smelled and tasted off. I ate anyway because I was starving, but I kept picking things off because it just tasted funky. I just warmed up my leftovers, and took about two bites and threw the rest away because I couldn't stomach it.  So, overall, this place was not what I was hoping it would be. I would highly suggest that if you're in the mood for BJs to go to the uptown one where the staff is more friendly and the food is a lot better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-3
Mariah V.,"San Clemente, CA",2,8,2,2.0,7/6/2017,"Let me start by saying I've been to this location multiple times and have enjoyed the food and service. Last week I went for my birthday dinner with a large group. One person in my party did not receive his food so the waiter offered a soup while he waited for his meal.. nice gesture-all is forgiven. When his meal came out it was not correct so the waiter had to correct the kitchen's mistake. We figured that was just due to us having a large party so we didn't mind it too much.  The time comes to collect our ticket. This is where mass confusion hits.. another table's entire ticket was on our tab. You would imagine this would take maybe 10 minutes to sort out- boy was I wrong. 45 minutes later I still had not received my dessert I ordered, the manager couldn't figure out how to fix the multiple mistakes on our tab, and we hadn't received refills on our drinks. When all was sorted out we received a discount on our entire ticket. My biggest complaint is that BJs has moved to a paperless program. The waiter was unable to fix his original mistake of accidentally placing another tables order on our ticket due to the program. The next complaint I have is that we made reservations a day in advance but they still gave us only one waiter who happened to have the least experience with large parties. And finally, Management should have stepped in quicker.. 45 minutes of waiting after meals are done is unacceptable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-3

I also get their hand crafter root beer which is off the chains!  Their down fall is their customer service of certain employees they have had a hostess who has a lil attitude which can throw your mood off right away.  Also, I had experienced a time where I was soo excited to try their avocado egg rolls but when I got it the avocado was not good which threw off the whole appetizer.

Karen M.,"Albuquerque, NM",36,208,123,2.0,7/18/2017,After taking a Yelp break and thinking about writing this review  - I am finally sitting down to do it.  Why do you do this to me BJ's? Why do you taunt with my emotions so?  I have such a love hate relationship with them.   The two star rating has nothing to do with our server because he was absolutely fine.....but the food - bleck.  Part of the dough on my daughter's pizza was still raw. It was basically dough with a ton of sauce. And  I would have really liked some burger to go with my bun. The food just wasn't good at all. I never feel comfortable sending food back so we went to the mall and got a pretzel.  It's unfortunate.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-3

Jan C.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,2,,5.0,10/14/2017,"This is the first time I have ordered from BJ's and will definitely order from them again. I have not been in the restaurant so I can't  comment about the service, decor, cleanliness etc. I sure can tell you about the yummy  good eats so here goes... We ordered enough food to feed 5 people and planned for leftovers. The servings were generous, and we were able to sample a bit of each other's orders.  I was pleased with the flavor and quality of everything I tasted. The Clam Chowder and Broccoli Cheddar soups were thick, delicious  and filling. Salads were fresh and crunchy. Burgers tasted as good as their aroma. The only thing that could be improved were the chicken wings. In all fairness I need to remember I'm not in Buffalo, and give the wings a ""7"".

Tricia C.,"Rio Rancho, NM",66,27,57,1.0,12/28/2016,"I've dined here multiple times and the biggest issue I have with BJs Cottonwood is their consistently bad service.  Tonight was borderline ok. Ordered a salad and a club sandwich and it took 40 minutes for our food to arrive.  Which finally came after multiple promises of our food being ""almost ready""!? I've been a server for years and that means that the server forgot to submit the order.   The other issue i have is with the last time we were here, we were going to the adjacent movie theater. The MANAGER actually suggested we order our movie tix from BJs because they were $3 less per ticket.  So i agreed, tipped on the total, arrived at the theater and was told that I had to upgrade to the regular price of $11??? That stinks of an upsell scam.  So, in summary; the food is decent but the service is never good.  Even from the manager.  Ugh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-3

Corina D.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,4,,1.0,11/3/2017,"I use to love this place.   I don't know what happened, but the last 3 visits where undesirable. I am patient when it comes to the food industry. I always give them more than one chance at a bad experience before I decide not to do business with them. I figure maybe server had a bad day, maybe they were short staffed......  These were my last experience on three separate occasions  1. They did not acknowledge us for at least 15 minutes after we were seated.  It wasn't until my husband got up and asked the hostess if our server was aware that we were there. Our food traveled at snail pace and we had to wait 20 minutes to get our check. 2. This time they brought me the wrong plate and by the time I got the right plate my husband was done with his dinner.  Since I figured it would take a while before I got my food. My husband and I shared his dinner. When my dinner finally came around, we asked for a box. 3. Last and final time. We had out of town coworkers that we invited to dinner. Our server got our drinks wrong and Once our server brought us our food, he never checked on us again. We had to ask the other servers for extra napkins, water, flatware.  He did finally show up, but only to drop and collect the check.   It's too bad, I really wanted to love this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-3
Tracy E.,"Lufkin, TX",22,6,10,5.0,7/7/2017,"Dear baby Jesus why have I not been here before?! This place is amazing! It being a brew house I figured it would have a large selection of beer and brew and a skimpy selection for food. Since I don't drink, i was extremely happy to see the amazing food selection. The restaurant was packed and we only had to wait 2-3 minutes for a table. Despite how busy they were, the atmosphere was really relaxed and the service was GREAT! As an appetizer we ordered the calamari. It was a little overcooked but the great dipping sauces made up for it. I ordered the Southern Comfort which is the chicken sandwich of all chicken sandwiches! Crispy, juicy, fried chicken breast, bacon, ham and Swiss cheese! No veggies needed for this bad boy! Delicious! My boyfriend ordered the two bone pork chop and MY GOODNESS! IT WAS HUGE! It takes a while to cook this monster but well worth the wait. It was so tender and so juicy and seasoned perfectly. For dessert we got the beignet. This was the true test since we are both lovers of the Cajun cuisine. It was a nice light take on a beignet. The strawberry and ice cream topping set it off. A little different since it had sugar and cinnamon instead of powdered sugar, but a delicious twist none the less. I would definitely make this a go to spot for the future!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-3

I booked a reservation for party of 9 people and when we got there we were framed into two small tables that fit four people each. It was very uncomfortable having to sit elbow to elbow with the other people at the table. We also had two high chairs that were also crammed with us. The children literally had no table space at all. We asked the manager if we could a larger table and we got told that as soon as a bigger table opened up they would mice us. Nonetheless we were never moved to bigger table and no one followed up with us on that situation, not even our server. I feel like customer service is definitely not their priority at this place. Whenever we would ask our server for any additional item such as napkins she would just ignore us and walk away. Very bad experience.

However unfortunately they still haven't got the service aspect locked down at this location yet I would wait a few more months before visiting this location. Stood at the door with no line and yet no one greeted us for a while so after making eye contact with 3-4 employees we asked if it was seat yourself reluctantly a waiter in the bar section said yes so we sat in a booth and then did not receive any service apparently he told no one we had sat down and again after making eye contact with every employee possible in clouding the manager and yet still not even a menu or a glass of water or anyone to even let us know they knew we were there we decided to leave and go to Buffalo Wild Wings now obviously the food isn't on the same level but I will say surprisingly their service was ten times better. BJ's is a decent place but like I said give them a few more months before you check them out because if not you will end up not wanting to return.

I told him what I wanted and then he proceeded to fill drinks for other people.Then he passed me off to the other bartender. The drink didn't arrive for at least 5 minutes. If I hadn't been traveling all day and hungry, I would have left. The guy shouldn't be a bartender if that's how he treats customers.

It took about 30 minutes for a soup and a sandwich.  When they finally came out, they brought my husband a BBQ platter not a sandwich and my bowl of soup was about a half of cup!  We didn't care at this point to say anything, we were so hungry. The bill was messed up twice, the server assumed that my husband was the only military person, eventhough, we clearly stated we both were.  I showed him my paperwork and he was able to fix it.  This process took 30 minutes since requesting the check.

As for drinks, I have really been enjoying their Temple of Stone IPA lately, and let me tell you- I am not one to like hoppy beers.

Has a good flavor and two dipping sauces.  We both had the roast beef dip, it came out pretty fast. However the presentation of the food was not pretty at all. It came with two sauces one au jus and other horse radish. The sandwich was not packed right all the meat was falling out from the middle because it was all packed there.

No, just pick that hair out and I'll dig right in!  What the heck did she think?!  When the 'fresh salad came out, the plate had a large chip in the edge...quality control anyone?  My burger was ""charred"" not 'flame broiled' but I was hungry so choked down about half.  Our friend's salmon salad lacked salmon.  The server brought it five minutes after the meal was served and it had clearly been microwaved too long, crusty and dry.  Saw the manager grab-assing with the waitresses but never once saw him approach ANY table to engage with customers.  At the end of the meal we asked to see the manager but after 15 minutes waiting decided to bag it and leave.  The hostess told us ""Quite a few tables have asked to see him so he's busy making the rounds""  Of course in the hour we sat there, he never 'made a round' and I could see the entire restaurant.  Haven't had this kind of problem before so was pretty surprised and embarrassed that this happened in front of our out of town guests.  Learned my lesson though.  No more chances for BJ's.  Too bad because I like the beer and the atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-3?start=100

Service slow at all points (getting started checking on drinks delivering food and especially getting the check) on both visits.

Some menu items better than others as far as taste value presentation.  My girlfriend liked her fish tacos, my Caesar salad with chicken was blah.   A large menu of items and drinks to choose from. I will say if you can't find something you like you should quit. maybe part of the issue that I see and read about the slow service on the food.

The food is solid chain-type food and has always been cooked correctly. It is easy to take the kids here because the environment is a little loud and distracting. I really appreciate that servers (other than the one assigned to your table) will run the food out, stop and check on you and refill drinks.

The fish and chips were swimming in the lake of oil...and served that way!  There literally was a puddle on my plate !  We had those removed from our bill, without argument.  They seemed understaffed or perhaps not trained properly.  There were busboys training servers, servers clearing large parties and arranging tables when the place was packed, and servers hanging out by the computers texting on their phones and, again, the place was packed!  Our poor server was incredibly nice but didn't seem to know what was going on, or maybe overwhelmed.  They had him serving tables at one end of the restaurant and serving tables clear at the other end of the restaurant.  Lack of management I guess.  The only positive...the beer was pretty good.  I think I might give them a shot again, maybe just for a pint and an appetizer.  This occurrence was when they first opened by about a month.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-3?start=80
Andrea R.,"Rio Rancho, NM",15,26,3,3.0,5/14/2015,"Meh!  Our server was awesome, she was very attentive carefully took our order, read it back to us twice.   But the kitchen still managed to mess it up.  No mayo tomatoes is what I asked for, my burger came with both.  My husband was plain with grilled onions his didn't come with onions.  Hubby ordered a salad and fries and I just had fries.  My burger didn't have fries his did, the food runner said ""well can you just take them off his plate?""  Thank goodness I looked at my burger before I ate it.  Sent it back, all they did was change the bun, which could cause a problem with a person who has allergies!!!!!   The manager did come over and asked what happened, wasn't at all concerned about it.  Didn't comp anything from our ticket, could have at least bought my $4 beer, or our app.   Disappointing because I KNOW our server did everything she was supposed to do.   It will be a while before we go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-3?start=80

Robert J.,"Rio Rancho, NM",2,5,,4.0,4/28/2015,"My friend and I went to this restaurant on a rainy Monday evening. I knew nothing about the place and neither of us had dined here before. So my entire experience was all first impressions.  BJ's impresses when you first walk in. It's a very open and spacious bar look and it was pretty busy even for a rainy Monday. The first thing people may want to know about the place is that it isn't a romantic setting in any way. The ceiling is very high and it has a ""stadium"" like feel and there is a loud murmur from the crowd at all times. The only people you can hear are the people in front of you. If you're looking for a quiet dining, this isn't the place.  Our waiter was exceptional. He answered all our questions and was fast and courteous.  The first thing you will hear, (and will be a common theme) is ""hand crafted"". This buzzword is abused here. Hand crafted beer, soda, pizza, blah blah blah. Who cares? Does it taste good and is it a value? The brewed Beers are clearly listed on a giant blackboard so that there is no confusion. The ""hand crafted"" sodas are actually really nice as they add a great deal of variety from the common Coke, Sprite, Dr. Pepper (""Is Mr.Pib okay?) nonsense from every other restaurant... ever.    The food is where this place looses that fifth star. For what little I was exposed to on my first visit, it was delicious. My friend had a ""hand crafted"" pizza and I had a deep dish lasagna. We debated on the large selection appetizers. Ultimately we got a  pepperoni pizza dip that was creative and really tasty. But, the quality and the taste of the food was not the issue.  The price was.  Holy crap. $15- $17 for a personal size pizza? Really? I hate to be ""That guy"" but you can get a large specialty (everything) pizza at Dion's for $12.  Dion's is the freaking place to beat in New Mexico and every New Mexican knows it. Pizza places just need to realize and accept that. This may be a chain restaurant, but please do some research! There's literally a Dion's Pizza connected to the SAME PARKING LOT.   Aside from the pizzas, I perused the entire menu. There isn't a single adult entree under $13. When you realize what you are eating is pretty much glorified bar food, it puts that into perspective. It's hella tasty glorified bar food, but still glorified bar food.  One thing that I will mention, and this is either a positive or negative depending on your personal opinion; The menu is huge. When they hand it to you, you're like: ""Golly, that is a weighty tome!"".  All in all, I enjoyed my experience at BJ's and I have every intention of visiting again. I will be weary of the prices when I go in next time and I will probably get a steak if I'm gonna pay that much. The steaks looked pretty good. We'll see.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-3?start=60
Terrance E.,"Corrales, NM",37,67,28,4.0,6/15/2015,"BJ brewhouse has always been good for us, whether it's in Phoenix, abq or this new one on abq westside. The menu is huge kinda like Cheesecake Factory where they have something for everyone. And the microbrews here are very good too! As for tonight it was busy Saturday and walked in at 830. Service was fairly good for our waitress being overworked. Food came out on time and was just as we have come to expect, good.  I was impressed that all BJs new locations import waiters from out of state to help train the new staff.  We had a guy who was from California that he been there for couple weeks training others.  So that right there tells me this place puts a lot into making sure all locations are keeping up there great service.   So like I said, this place is good as all other BJs we've been too and will definitely be back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-3?start=60
Michelle P.,"Albuquerque, NM",25,103,211,3.0,6/7/2015,"This location is still new, so they are still working out all the problems. I will update as time goes by that they can find their flow to run smoothly. The food is good, same as the Coronado location. Service is bumpy, and the food runners are still learning tables so you get them coming by with food and not knowing where to takeit so they tend to just ask every table down the row. I been there, I have done the restaurant biz before. I feel bad for giving only 3 stars, as I know once they get runing right It's going to be a great place. But however I do have to review everything honestly. Definitely try their brews. I particularly love the red WITH their cider added, yummy! Extra spicy wings and their burgers are my favorite",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-3?start=60
Reva W.,"Albuquerque, NM",13,2,,3.0,6/30/2016,"Love the variety of brews, and the food is decent.  the service is fair but the prices are a bit high for a chain.

Ashley E.,"Albuquerque, NM",226,339,106,1.0,11/30/2015,"Yeah....methinks not. Awful service, bad food, long wait time. I really don't think this place will last unless there are some major changes. The food is not prepared with love and care, it is very obviously pre-packaged frozen stuff that's just thrown into an oven, fryer, etc. Save yourself some money, time, and exasperation and go elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-3?start=60

Cassidy Z.,"Corrales, NM",42,174,24,2.0,9/13/2015,"Let me just start by saying that I cannot stand having a book for a menu, which is exactly what is given to you when you are seated at this restaurant. Actually, you get two books--one for drinks, one for food. To me, its about quality over quantity. I want food made-to-order and made well. If a restaurant only has fifteen options, so be it, if it meets these standards. BJ's for all obvious intents and purchases does not. Its a chain restaurant so expect chain food. Not a fan.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-3?start=60
Lena L.,"Albuquerque, NM",1,94,,4.0,2/26/2016,"I think I love this place just because it's completely random. The menu has something for everyone. They don't stick to any type of food. I like that. Burgers, chicken, fish, pasta, pizza, Cajun, Southern style....anything from cherry glazed salmon to jambalaya to tacos.  My first stop, I was pretty skeptical. It's just a big chain and I felt kinda meh about it. I ordered the BBQ bison burger with the Asian slaw, and I am now really sorry for being skeptical. That burger was really, really good. The BBQ flavor wasn't overpowering and I could still taste the meat. The slaw was nicely seasoned. I ate the entire thing, and I usually have leftovers. Not this time. The entire table shared the cookie trio with ice cream and everyone was  very, very happy.  I ordered their brand of berry cider and I was happy with it. Their beer isn't life changing, but it's decent beer. I tried the stout and was pleasantly surprised.  My second visit, I had the Ahi Tuna salad and again was happy. Tuna tasted good, and the salad had good flavor.  I took some family there who had flown in for vacation (they used to live here, so they have already been to all the New Mexican places). One of my relatives had the lasagna, served in a little cast iron pot, and it was really good. Just a nice, solid pasta dish.  I'm happy with this place. Chain or not, it's pretty good. Good beer, good cocktails, good food, and good service on the times I have visited.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-3?start=60
Robert P.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",56,100,22,3.0,10/30/2015,"I have two very conflicting experiences here. One I would rate a 1-star, and the other I would rate a 5-star. Both experiences were with the same two people, at 10pm at night (after we got off work). Let's start with the 5. 5-stars:  The three of us sat at the bar and received great service. The bartender was extremely social and tended to our every need. He was on top of everything, recommended us great drinks, and joked around with us. The food came out great, albeit a tad slow, but it was a fine experience non-the-less.  For the one-star: We were sat down at a table this time by Amber (I believe, says she has a husband that works in the kitchen). She smelled like cigarettes, must have been after a break. She was alright in the beginning, served us our drinks and took our order fine. Now the kitchen was slow as heck this night, I don't know why. There weren't that many tables, either that or we all ordered at the same time. The food that came out was good though, no complaints on that. Where it fell apart was our waters were empty, and I was waiting to order another drink. When she came around we ordered drinks and ordered pizookies. We ordered the pizookies at around 10:50, and we didn't receive them until around 11:30. The worst part was, after we ordered our pizookies, without even receiving them yet, she brought us out our check. Dessert wasn't even ready, and you brought out our check? Not to mention we paid at 11:15, and she kept reassuring us that the pizookies would be out soon. At 11:20 she said, ""Don't worry I have a girl in the back that's going to bang them out in 2 minutes!"". Still, nothing until 11:30. To give us the kicker she gave us a coupon for $5 off $25 our next meal. What the f? Honestly, just an overall bad experience and no manager to be found. Very disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-3?start=60
Lisa R.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,4,,1.0,8/9/2015,"My friend and I went in Tuesday 8/4/15 night what a disappointment. Waited literally 25 mins for first beer on tap with a half assed ""I'm sorry"" from the waitress. I finished my drink and waited with my friend until she finally brought his beer out, hallelujah!! She Said they had trouble with the hoses or something I don't know I'm not a bartender and really didn't care and At that point something should have been offered to my friend to offset the wait. Or while we were waiting an explanation with an offer of ""can I get you another kind of beer it's going to be awhile?"" ""Our manager can't seem to get his head out of his @&$"" is how I felt by then... But instead she avoided our table until said beer came out, weird.. Then, when I asked to speak to the manager he was unprofessional in his mannerisms and speaking skills stating quickly same scenario as waitress not acknowledging that waiting 25 mins is unacceptable and ""let me at least buy it for you.""  We Then had to ask for napkins from waitress to eat appetizers AND  she brought cocktail napkins no forks?? I thought when we asked she'd bring set ups? Maybe a fork for the avocado egg rolls but nope SO I had to ask for ""big napkins and forks,"" feeling like I was making a request from my friends 4 year old son. Was a mistake will not go back. As we were leaving I used ladies room thankfully or I would have lost my appetite as two toilets were backed up, the trashes both overflowing and icky stuff on the bathroom counters. Yuck!! I'll stick with Applebee's where if they screw up they make it right for the customer, and the waitress know if you're eating you need napkins and forks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-3?start=60

Am I crazy for not being offered a replace the drink??? Not my fault homie knocked it over! No water refills for my friend on her water either.
