Melinda S.,"Plano, TX",91,136,547,4.0,12/4/2017,How do you know when a restaurant cares? They read the Yelp reviews and respond. My last review got the attention of General Manager and Business Owner.  I received a professional phone call that offered a sympathetic ear. They returned the reward points that I believed were gone. And forward an E-Courtesy card to come back and try them again. We sincerely appreciate the acknowledgement and we will go back.  I will update this review at that time :),https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-allen
Rafaela D.,"Allen, TX",23,37,41,2.0,12/23/2017,"My friends and I came on a Saturday night expecting a good time, but was let down by their service. When I go out with my friends, I already expect cheeky employees to look down on us because I understand we look young for our age (18) but I have never been so annoyed.  First thing our waiter, sir Mike, says with a smile as he hands us the menu, ""So I'm guessing you guys will be ordering cookies tonight? And I'm assuming ya'll will just be getting water"". I don't know if he meant that as a joke or not but most definitely we felt slightly irked and insulted; obviously he was trying to imply something (And he wasn't completely wrong, most of our group came just for their Pizookies). I quickly respond firmly but respectfully with a no, actually I'll be getting a Coke and a regular bowl of clam chowder. My friends were still kind enough to tip him because he still did serve us and occasionally check up on us.  Joke or not, whatever cheekiness he had shown was all completely unnecessary because a PAYING customer is a customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-allen
Jeff N.,"Allen, TX",5,49,34,2.0,12/18/2017,"First off, where did our server go?  Someone else serves the food so I know she's not busy doing that, how come we only see her every ten minutes or so?  soup served warm (not hot).  Ordered salmon, served us chicken.  Steaks tasted awful.  Tender, but somehow medium rare and still dry, weird texture, way over peppered.  So they adjusted the bill, which I appreciate, but this was a pretty poor meal.  Tried again since my wife likes a certain salad here.  She just said, ""remind me to NEVER eat here again.""  Slow slow slow slow slow.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-allen
Dwayne W.,"Frisco, TX",9,170,86,4.0,1/3/2018,We seem to eat here about once a quarter.  The food is good and potions are big with prices being acceptable.  I would like to food to wow me but it never really does but we keep going back.  I love their beer and variety.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-allen
Laura W.,"Dallas, TX",542,207,584,3.0,4/21/2017,"BJ's is ok. If you don't know what to get for dinner or the person you're going to be eating with wants something completely different from you, BJ's has the biggest freaking menu ever. This location is as ok as the rest of them I guess. I've been here several times and I don't think they've ever surpassed ""just ok"".  Our server tonight took our drink order and like 10 minutes later he walks by and says he'll have the drinks out to us in just a minute. Then like 10 minutes later he walks by again and my bf says ""hey can we get those drinks?"" and the guy says ""oh you want to order some drinks?.... *pause*...oh yeah, that's right! I remember."" And then he left to go get our drinks. We literally talked about it 3 times.... really? A half hour later we went through that all over again when my bf ordered another blue moon. Except this time the server actually offered it. So he forgot what HE offered. **face palm** The BJ's favorite pizza was great but the Mediterranean chicken pita was disgusting. It was soggy and smelled stale. I couldn't eat it. Overall, we've been here several times and we'll be back. There are tons of options and it's usually ok. Just don't expect much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-allen
Amanda R.,"Plano, TX",50,232,778,2.0,2/19/2017,"First time ever eating at BJ's. Started off on the wrong foot with the hostess.  The table was dirty and still had the previous guests payment on the table.  I told her this was a dirty table and needed a wipe down. She said it was clean. Returned with a dry napkin and wiped the table sending crumbs to my lap. What a bitch move. Seriously.  Our waiter moved us to another table. Hard to move on to greater things after being treated as non-worthy customers.  Internally, I was fuming. I'm angry and ready to just leave. My friend says ""I'm hungry up to you"". Girl talk translation means enough/feed me.  My friends salad must've been really good. She would have licked the plate on that Asian salad had it not been over board. I had the blackened shrimp tacos. The sides were awful. Chipotle sauce, greasy chips, and some green tinged mayo avocado sauce. The tacos were good. They also offer flavored teas. Which are good if you can get them to bring you a refill. States unlimited. I got one refill. (Fail) The menu is like reading  ""War and Peace.""  It is overwhelming, way too many options. Doesn't appear that they have one speciality food that makes them shine.  They do offer a large variety of beers. Our waiter without a name tag provided ok service.  Never been here and you guessed right, don't think I will be returning. Absolutely nothing here grabbed my attention as wanting to be a repeat. I perused the web site and found this  ""We are an award winning company with an ""of service"" culture, anchored by solid hospitality and guided by our compass of quality"".  That is so laughable!  2017/23",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-allen
Terri J.,"McKinney, TX",130,344,579,1.0,2/26/2017,"Update: visited on 2/24 around 6 pm. Was not acknowledged for over ten minutes. Ordered a steak medium rare. Steak came out medium well instead. Tried to get a waiter to take it back but gave up after 20 minutes. Partner also got a steak medium and his was also medium well. We decided to get a pazookie and it took over 25 minutes to come and ice cream was completely melted. Such a disappointment. Wanted to use mobile app to pay and it doesn't work. Downgrading to a one star as the food and service have completely gone downhill apparently.  ***************** Ok. So I'm updating my review as promised. Chris, the GM actually reads Yelp, and sort of cares about what we think, which I find pretty freaking refreshing. So thanks to him reaching out to me, I took my Manchild and our two kids, who weren't with us last time, back to BJ's.  I signed up for the online app which gets you lots of perks. Through there you can check to see if there's a wait, and tonight at 5:30, there was none. When we got there three minutes later, there was a ten minute wait. So I'd say that wait list thing needs improving, but we were seated by 5:40, so it wasn't a big deal.  Service was excellent this time around except for the very beginning. We didn't get silverware until after the salads came and after asking twice. Other than that, it was a flawless performance. Victoria was a doll and she smiled the entire time.  I got a wedge salad and it was great. My hubs got a sirloin that he said was better than Texas Roadhouse, and for him that's like the highest praise ever. It was cooked PERFECTLY. The pic makes it look small, but it's a thick cut and he got a salad (not pictured). We both had cheddar mashed potatoes but you couldn't really taste the cheddar, which bummed me out. I got the Parmesan crusted chicken, which, in all honesty was not great. I'd seen pictures of this crispy chicken dish and what I got was drowned in lemon sauce and soggy. It still tasted fine, but wasn't my favorite.  So here's the real update: I originally stated in my review that this place is basically just Cheesecake Factory. I stand by that, but here's the deal: unlike at the Cheesecake Factory, I didn't have to wait an hour. I didn't pay $18 for that chicken...I paid $13. This place is far more kid friendly, something we didn't notice when we came here the first time. It's not as fancy as the CF, and that's good for our 4 person family. The kids menu here is pretty fantastic. Plus, the cookie pazookie is just something everyone has to experience.  I can't give it five stars. It needs tweaking still, but I can say that before the GM reached out if written it off. We just left and we are already coming back to watch the game later this week without the odd and try out the happy hour specials. It's progress that wouldn't have been made had the GM not reached out. So thank you. Get the salted caramel pazookie and thank me later.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-allen
Ralph D.,"Grand Prairie, TX",2,30,23,2.0,12/28/2017,"So in my mind going to a restaurant involves the three A's....Attentive-Accurate-Added Value. The BJ's brand and product speaks volumes in terms of menu options and dining experience.  Not the first visit yet first time at this location and missed the mark. Attentive a C-. Personable server, meatball appetizer (delicious) comes out promptly alas no silverware so looked good for what felt like 5 minutes.  Would have enjoyed more if not luke warm by first bite. Accurate a D. Order of the Best Beginnings came out wrong unbeknownst to us until the correct order was served. An apology was given yet the dinning rythem was off. Wondering Who's order we picked on.  Added-value a F. Apology aside no attempt to make the oversight right or presence of a manager to advocate this is not the BJ's product.  Clearly the taste is great yet for this first impression no interest in returning. Just saying.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-allen
Brixton P.,"Dallas, TX",23,263,182,3.0,3/20/2017,"BJ's is one of the few places in the area that serves food late into the evenings which is a plus in my book.  A lot of restaurants nearby close by 9 pm which makes this place very busy on the weekends.  We opted for healthy-lighter meals like the Roasted Chicken Peruvian Quinoa Bowl and Super Salad which were both good.  Service was decent for a large chain restaurant but can be spotty at times. If you sign up for their email promotions, you can get great deals which makes you want to visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-allen
Tim L.,"Richardson, TX",0,26,,2.0,12/22/2017,"Front staff , not the friendliest....it took 10 minutes until wait staff addressed our table...ordered tea , it was so watered down I sent it back.  We ordered flat bread CA club, decent...ordered lentil soup, decent taste, But luke warm,  no crackers...also individual pizza, aka dough ball, so much dough I just gave up.

Dennis S.,"Dallas, TX",510,854,21,3.0,10/11/2017,"My wife and I went here for lunch. We have lived in the area for three years and have never been here. It is very nicely decorated and inviting. Our server did not find us for several minutes to check on drinks. When she did, they were slow to come. The food we ordered was pretty good, but again, the delivery time was unreasonably slow. Our server apologized for the delay but we did not understand why. It was not busy or crowded. Anyway, the food was not exceptional enough to cause us to return. Check it out, you may have better luck.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-allen
Lokesh P.,"Frisco, TX",5,23,11,3.0,4/16/2017,"This was our second time here.. again for a special occasion...  First positive points: 1. BJ's Brewhouse Blonde Beer:  very nice, light flavor.. 2. Raspberry Lemonade: Fresh and not too sweet.. my kid loved it.. 3.crispy flatbread nachos (appetizer): Really good, they made light on cheese as suggested and it came out nice.. they should cut the pieces better.. we struggled with it for few minutes 4. Veg Burger: I didn't try it but it was finished so assuming that it must have been good... last time the soya patty was not cooked well... but this time it was good 5. Vegetarian Deep Dish Pizza: Yummy, loved it... light of cheese and very finely made.. can go anytime for that Low point: - Service: It took 20-25 minutes for the first server to come after we took seats... about 45 minutes for order to come.. and got our silver after food was served.. - Rest Rooms: Horrible (Both Men and Women).. stinky, wet, slippery... Yuks!!! Basic hygiene missing!!! I was thinking of complaining to manager... but then did not do it... Good food... make sure you don't drink too much to go to restroom ... cut one star for hygiene and service..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-allen
Jack M.,"Celina, TX",1,86,1,1.0,8/14/2017,"WOW, Shame on me for not reading the reviews before going here. My wife and I went here for lunch on Sunday, since it was early in the day we did not have any of the good beers they offer. Our waiter Christopher F came to our table in introduced himself, he asked what we wanted to drink. We both asked for Ice Tea and I also asked him if he could bring me a packet of sugar since I only wanted a small bit in my Tea. A couple of minutes later he brought us some Ice water and took our order. Someone else brought our meals to us. Christopher came by a few minutes later during our meal to ask how they were and asked if we would like refills on our drinks. I told him we would love refills on the Ice Teas he never brought. He said he was sorry and walked away and came back and filled our glasses. Mind you I was polite when I said this to him. When our meal was done the bus boy came and cleared our plates. Christopher came by and dropped the check at our table and said thanks and walked away. And yes the Ice Teas were on the bill. I had to find him and ask him if he had any clue what good service was because the Ice Teas were still on the bill. He took it and walked away and came back and dropped off a corrected one. Never one word of apology. The meal was very good and I can get good meals at lots of restaurants, but the service is what makes us go back to a lot of places. When people ask why so many restaurants close down I tell them there's a good chance they had poor service. Also when done we could not find a manager to talk with. You need to fix your service if you want to stay in business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-allen

Gloria C.,"Allen, TX",159,214,633,4.0,8/8/2016,Came for a late night dessert after a concert at the Allen event center. This was one of the few places that were open past 10. All my husband and I wanted was the pizookie but it's been a while since we've been here so I forgot all of the different kinds they had. I was craving salty and sweet so salted caramel it was going to be. It comes in a mini pan so it's right out of the oven. The cookie is so warm and gooey plus the added vanilla ice cream makes this dessert so sought after when it's late or after a good dinner.  We had already ate dinner so we weren't going to get any food. The restaurant is big and there's a ton of seating available. There's a bunch of tv's so it's a great place to go when you're in need of food and also some sports action. Will def come back for the food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-allen
Tara K.,"Dallas, TX",0,32,4,5.0,9/16/2017,"I'm a fan of BJ's and decided to give this location a shot while visiting from out of state. Excellent decision. I honestly have zero complaints! My husband and I went during lunch Friday, we were kindly greeted, and seated right away. The menu has loads of variety and their lunch prices are hard to beat. I ended up ordering the chicken tenders while he ordered wings and we weren't disappointed. Everything came out quickly, fresh, and tasted amazing. He'd recommend the rootbeer glaze if you get wings. Amazing! The atmosphere here was great too. Like I said, we were visiting from another state, but this location seemed to have a bit of a charm to it that was nice. Everyone was super friendly, our waiter was incredibly nice and on-point with checking in to make sure our drinks were always filled and our food was all right.

Said hello to him and the dude stared me up and down with a cocky  smirk and walked away with no response. I just wanted some Mac and Cheese, not compete in a dominant stand-off as if I'm some threat to the woman he's courting. Won't describe how he looked or mention names because I'm no tattle tale, guy probably works hard. Maybe the managers should reiterate basic hospitality.

Settled for veggie penne pasta plus a garden salad. Both were prepared in reasonable time and pasta was cooked really well. Big servings so bring some good appetite.

Desmond S.,"Allen, TX",303,252,346,3.0,10/12/2016,"I'm not sure why, but I never really look forward to coming to BJ's for food or drinking.  I've never had a bad experience here. I think the reason is because it's pretty normal.  Nothing really stands out to me.  Don't get me wrong, I'll probably be back, but I won't jump through hoops to do so. The service here has never really caught my attention, it varies.  It's not horrible service, but not outstanding service.  And I mean never.  The food is good.  I've never had a bad meal here.  Just not a great meal either. On my latest trip with the wife and kids, I was greeted at the revolving door and seated a few minutes later.  We waited quite some time for service even though it wasn't too packed, but the game was on.  Our waiter was OK, not great, just OK and seemed rushed even though it was not packed. Our food came and it was good.  The food was warm and prepared well. Refilling the drinks was not part of the deal I guess, since the waiter didn't really come back too often to check on us. The place is clean, the bathrooms are clean, the staff is clean.  There's nothing bad about this place to me, just a bit underwhelming.  The beer variety is pretty good, so if the guys want to get together and have a few brews and watch the game, this place works.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-allen?start=20

The food was delicious!  I am a huge fan of bread bowls and coming from New England I know bread bowls and BJ's has one of the best I've ever had!  It was huge, it wasn't so hollowed out that there was no bread to scoop with the soup, and the bread was so crispy that I ate the whole thing.  I LOVE CARBS.  And that is why I also finished the pizza I ordered.  It was a lot of food for 2 people to order and eat, but we did.  What can I say?  My hubby and I love to eat.  Our server was very attentive and we had a good eating experience.  The only down side was the long wait.  Maybe will try to go for lunch instead next time to see if the wait time improves.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-allen?start=20

First of all we walk in get sat outside and never get greeted by anyone for over ten minutes. We finally get ahold of a person to take our order and it ended up being the manager. (Thank you) because I felt like we basically didn't even have a server. The guy who apparently had our section finally decided to come by, no apology, not even a name. But whatever~ the food came out fairly quick and just how we wanted it. The stuffed mushroom is by far my favorite appetizer here ever! A must get if you love spinach & mushrooms!  I tend to try a lot of different things here every time I come, the pizza is good, the pastas are good, and the burgers are good. I specially had a shroom burger that day which was very satisfying. I wish we had room for their famous pizookie (giant cookie in a pan with ice cream on top) but I was stuffed.  Overall, thanks to the manager that made up for the lack of service we got.

I understand it's a Saturday and it's busy, but part of our party had to go to the bar to get drinks, most of our drinks arrived the same time as our entrees, and our food looked like it was slopped on our plates like cafeteria food. I  asked for the blue burger medium rare, came out well done, thin patty (which wouldn't have bothered me but my bf got a burger as well and the patty was 4x as big as mine), burnt cheddar on the bun...my burger didn't come with cheddar, almost like they tried to scrape it off and reuse it.. I replaced my fries with Brussels sprouts... let me just say they looked like something a garbage disposal vomited up... I LOVE Brussel sprouts... I didn't touch them and they're usually so good here! I have a freezer bag of Brussel sprouts i can pop in the microwave at home at all times...those would have been a million times better, I am shocked they were plated in the first place, even more shocked they were brought to the table... nobody's food was cooked correctly. Idk if management changed recently, but something is no longer right here and quality has gone down the drain, it shows with servers, and cooks, customer service and quality no longer mean anything, sad to see.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-allen?start=20
Leigh C.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,1,1.0,10/14/2017,"Let me first start by saying our waitress Isabel was amazing last night. She was attentive and on top of it. I ordered a BBQ pork sandwich and fries. The Pulled pork was burnt, chunky, and cold. The bun was burnt so badly that if you had of threw it at a wall it wouldn't have broke. It almost seemed like because we were there at 10pm that they weren't cooking fresh food anymore. The fries were cold and burnt. I let our waitress know that my pulled pork sandwich was cold. She was super amazing and took it back. When it was brought back out it was the same burnt pork but heated super hot. I took one bite, paid our tab, and left. I did not want to give our waitress a hard time  because she was amazing. Note to BJ's , please manager your kitchen during later hours to make sure they are cooking fresh food for customers.

Martin M.,"Plano, TX",0,2,,1.0,10/8/2017,"This is my personal experience this afternoon and you should take this review as such.  Running errands I stopped in for a bacon cheese burger and fries. Ordered and was asked if I was okay with the burger done Medium Well (defined by the food network as 145 degrees with 3 minutes rest or between 140 to 150 degrees). I took one bite and then looked at the burger and found it dark on the outside and red throughout. Not pink in the middle, but from the layer of black on the outsides to red and uncooked inside throughout; it was raw! After I pushed the entire meal away and asked for my check I was offered to speak to a manager?!? Why would I debate uncooked food with someone is beyond me. So I said no, give me my bill and left a 15% tip over full price for a burger that had 1 bite, that I describe as a perfect home for a parasite. This is my personal experience today. If you enjoy this place I say good for you and please don't let me stop you from enjoying but as a local who has visited this restaurant as part of his weekend ritual before running errands this place has gone down hill.  Oh, the triangle napkin placed on the bar prior to my plate being served was filled with crumbs, so clearly I received an unwashed napkin used by who knows how many previous customers. I should have left then.  I am not returning there and want nothing from them in way of apology or free anything.

They were out of the pazookie we wanted. That coupled with the well-done prime rib should have resulted in some sort of discount or compensation. However, the table next to us received comped appetizers and desserts because they wanted to speak to the manager to thank him for already donating pizzas to their fundraiser the next day and he never made it out to their table.

There is a separate spirits menu that is repeated for the first 6.5 pages of the main menu before you get to the food menu. Too much.  2) ""We don't serve that anymore"". Well, if you don't, reprint your menu. Although when your menu is larger and more difficult to read than a Gutenberg bible, it's an intimidating task.

Anywho, I came on a Friday night with a couple of friends. It took 20 minutes just for our waiter to finally approach our table. Then it took another 10 minutes to actually get our drinks to us. She didn't even bother taking our order... After waving her down, we  give her our orders. I don't think it takes close to an hour to get our food?  I must say, the food was great . However, our waitress barely came to check on us throughout the whole time we were there. She never even apologized or notified us of the long wait. We then asked her for dessert when we flagged her down again, and after 30 minutes of waiting again, she got our orders wrong. Whatever. She even seemed to have an attitude.  We spent more than 2 hours here, and we had terrible service, so we didn't bother giving her a tip since she was so bad. We walked outside the restaurant to chat a bit before we left, and before you know it the waitress chased us out to the parking lot to yell at us for not giving her a tip.. Really? How unprofessional . I understand that tips are a huge deal for waitresses as I used to waitress at 2 restaurants myself, but when you can't even serve us yourself ( I saw other servers come to us for help more than she did ) , you don't deserve a tip.. I always hesitate to come back because I never want to see her again",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-allen?start=80

We (party of 4) ordered as soon as our drinks arrived. One tomato salad, Ahi Poke, and 2 flatbreads. And then we waited..  The tomato salad arrived... we watched her eat almost all of it. I had to ask for a refill, it was taking that long. I was really surprised. Now, if you have ever had Ahi Poke, it is served raw. No cooking needed. It took 25 minutes to receive it. That arrived with the 2 flatbread pizzas. Had to ask for plates.

Myia B.,"Dallas, TX",502,698,850,3.0,5/20/2014,"Came here on Sunday and decided to dine on the patio. There was a decent crowd but it quickly dwindled around 8:30pm.  David was our server and did an okay job of being friendly. I was hoping they'd have some type of reverse happy hour (even though I promise I don't drink ;p) but they didn't.  Tried the calamari (around $10) and it was nothing spectacular. It needed salt. The wind (which we miscalculated to be much calmer than it was) quickly chilled us and our appetizer which didn't help the fairly bland flavor of the dish. It was served with a pretty ""mayo-y"" aioli and a marinara sauce.  Tried the Mediterranean pan pizza (around $16) after being steered in the pizza direction by David upon contemplating between a pie and a burger. I ordered it with extra pesto. The dough was good. The toppings were ehhh. The peperoncinis could be replaced by onions or something else with bite on this pie. The Kalamata olives and the peppers were competing for flavor punch. The dough would have been even better had it not been so dry - even though I asked for a little extra pesto, I barely got any. I ended up requesting some on the side (it was brought out ice cold but was tasty and did the trick at wetting the thick dough). Tried a slice of the chicken bacon ranch pie and also filed it as ""okay."" The menu offers up a decent selection of different food items (wings, pasta, steak, ribs, burgers, salads, sandwiches, seafood dishes, pizzas, etc). I've tried the grilled chicken pasta before but wasn't impressed. The next time I venture in I'll try something else - their double burger.

So not impressed. I should warn you that any time I eat a Mexican-style-western-style egg rolls, it's pretty weak in general. Egg rolls are an Asian thing, not a white-man thing (usually). It's like buying a Pitt bull but getting a rat terrier in strength.Yeah, both are loveable dogs but that's about it in similarity. The  fried calamari appetizer was pretty decent. I mean, its a fried food. Just b/c you are in the south doesn't make you an expert, but the batter was decent and the calamari was pretty fresh. However, it is a franchise so how good can you really make it?  Then we ordered the Mediterranean pizza (deep dish, large). Decent pizza; crust similar to that of Pizza Hut's (PH) pan pizza. Although PH is cheap, it's so much more delish...b/c it's cheap. But if I'm paying $25 for a large, i rather take my money and go to Whole Foods. They have some legit pizza, and it's a Grocery store.  So if you care about ambiance and a bar, they make strong drinks and it does look nice.

The club was ok, not great.  The chicken had no flavor and the sandwich was dry.  I asked for a side of mayo, hoping it would have been the roasted garlic mayo that came in the sandwich (which if it did, I did not taste it) and here comes regular mayo (dang IT). It did little to add any flavor.  The avocado was real soft and I thought it was guacamole (I even looked).  The skinny fries are a nice touch, but next time, wedge cut fries.  The club that I am used to has three slices of bread.  This sucker had two thick pieces which added to the blandness and dryness of the sandwich.

She ordered the new top sirloin with white cheddar mash and asparagus.  First attempt came out burnt, way over medium and clearly blackened.  The seasoning was overpowering and carbon flavored as well.  The second attempt was delayed because they were busy, I can only assume we weren't made a priority and had to wait in queue with the rest of the food orders.  I was finished and had a box for my leftovers before she got her second attempt.   Round Two: Second steak not as badly burned, but they decided to leave the side that was burned on top as the presentation side like a big fuck you.  Had to scrape off the over powering seasoning again because they apparently felt the need to choke the steak out with seasoning.  Mash was average, asparagus came out half cooked and some was raw.

Christopher W.,"Plano, TX",0,1,,1.0,3/15/2014,"I generally enjoy BJs but I think last night's experience has effectively removed them from my list of options in the future. My wife and I arrived to find the restaurant somewhat crowded, not unusual for a Friday night. We were told that inside seating would be 10-15 minutes, but if we were willing to side outside (in deteriorating weather) that we could be sat immediately.  Not expecting a long stay, we opted to sit outside. Apparently saying ""outside is fine"" is BJs-speak for ""I have influenza"" as we were sat in the farthest corner from all other patrons and were completely ignored at that point, without a single member of the staff inquiring as to whether or not we had been helped despite food delivery and clean up going on at multiple tables in the area. Thankfully I was amused more than upset.  After about 20 minutes, I called the restaurant's carry-out ordering number and asked to speak to the Manager. After waiting for a few minutes, I finally reached him, explained that we were already seated and asked if he could help us get some service.  He said someone would be out there right away. About 2 minutes later (way too long, given the circumstances, unless I caught him on the toilet?), he and a waitress came out, and finally we had our orders taken, ordering much smaller items than usually as we had little faith in the rest of the experience going well.  The manager also offered a free appetizer. I thought I had seen Dorothy and Toto fly by in the wind just a minute prior, and would have preferred an offer of an indoor seat instead, but the gesture was appreciated.  My wife was ready to leave but the experience was like a train wreck so far, and it couldn't pull myself away from it in case they messed up again. I wasn't disappointed. After waiting about the usual amount of time for our food, our entrees arrived, yet the appetizer never came. Refraining from laughing, I asked about the status of that particular item, and the server said he would check. A few minutes later, the appetizer finally arrived (potato skins) but they were overdone and very dry - oh well, they were free, we can deal. The rest of our food was good (burger and a sandwich) and at least one thing went right - the appetizer was indeed removed from the bill. The waitress was also friendly, but seemed a bit nervous - perhaps she was new? We still gave her a healthy % for what I hope was a unique experience. Overall, a terrible yet amusing experience that marked the end of my trips to this particular chain.  For those visiting this location, I recommend you get a drink at the bar before being seated to help you mellow out before your ""dining experience"" begins!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-allen?start=100

I took my family to B.J's for my son's graduation dinner on June 1st.   We had a party of 10 and had called ahead for seating (what I was told to do when I called earlier in the week for reservations).   It made no difference, as they wouldn't seat us until our party was all there.   Apparently the group behind us had parties showing up to their empty seats after we were seated.  How is that?  I frikkin called ahead and had to wait, looking at my empty and already set up table, until all of us showed up.  I decided to go with the flow and not get upset.   The service and atmosphere were very good.  The waitress was very nice, though she disappeared once in a while for a few minutes too long. We ordered a variety of things:   My wife ordered the ""pot stickers"" appetizer (6 chicken pot stickers w/ dipping sauce).   Looked good and was tasty.  For what it was, the price was a bit out of bounds, being $6.95.   She also ordered the lettuce wraps, and she ate about half of it, and boxed the rest to go. The Mom in Law  ordered a ""Crispy Chicken sandwich"".  It looked good, but she only ate half of it and picked at the second piece of chicken in it.   The chicken looked like the ready made breaded tenders you get frozen at Walmart.  She said the wedge fries were good.   The burger had heat wilted (from the chicken) shredded ice berg lettuce on it which made it look cheap.  She didn't box any leftovers. The three boys with us ordered medium (12inch) deep dish pizza's for a whopping $17.25 each.  Ouch!   They eat like horses, and neither had eaten more than a couple of slices before we left.  These got boxed, as I know they will eat them later.   The youngest ate the rest of his later that evening. I ordered the T.v. advertised ""Crispy Jalapeno Burger"".   It was nearly cold when I got it, the same issue as the Mom in Law, wilted crappy ice berg lettuce.   The patty was not hot, not seasoned well, overdone, dry, and not good tasting.   I would have been happier with a Big Mac.   This two-part dinner set me back $10.25 cents.   The fries were good!    The beers and drinks are tasty.  I usually won't spend $5.50 for a beer, or $6.95 for a glass of wine.   Did it this once to please the ladies.   Dang! This  place needs a new name!  Change it from ""B.J's"" to ""Screwed""!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-allen?start=120

Chris W.,"McKinney, TX",2665,646,963,3.0,3/25/2014,"This was my first time at a BJs.  I arrived on a busy Saturday night.  There was a 30 minute wait for a table of two. It was crowded at the bar so we had to wait at the front.  When we were seated my husband and I started with fried cheese sticks.  My husband picked them since they don't serve queso.  I really get overwhelmed when a menu is a book or when a restaurant is American fare and serves everything.  I asked the server what they liked to eat,  so I took his recommendation of the chicken lettuce wraps.  They were good, were light, but filling.  My husband ordered a burger and said it was OK.  There was nothing outstanding about this place to make us go back, unless a friend wanted to meet there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-allen?start=120

Bill B.,"Dallas, TX",102,580,1772,5.0,8/5/2015,"We had a very simple lunch, salad and soup. I opted for the Caesar salad along with tortilla soup and my spouse opted for the garden salad along with clam chowder. My salad was excellent. I would prefer the tortilla soup not have the added thickner which it did. Not a lot of chicken in the chicken tortilla soup. The spices were about right for me but too spice for my spouse. Her clam chowder also had the thickner in it which was also a little too much. The garden salad was fresh and the Italian dressing was on the side so she could add as much or little as she desired. The menu is extensive. Just about like a Cheesecake Factory menu. A lot of different items which seems to mean that they must stock a lot of food and the cooks must now about a lot of the times being cooked by them. The first part of the menu is all about the various drinks available. The interior of the restaurant is very nice and done up in mirrors, dark woods and good lighting.

After we got our food our waitress only came back twice in a 45 minute time period. Once she did come back she brought drinks, while putting our drinks on the table she spilt two drinks on my friends and I.

Allison E.,"Fort Myers, FL",299,328,242,4.0,6/5/2013,"This place is just what you expect it to be - large restaurant with loads of tables, decent sized bar area, extensive menu choices (salads, sandwiches, pizza, pasta, etc..), casual atmosphere and decent service.   BJ's offers quite a few beers to choose from, including their own in-house brewed.    I am not a huge beer drinker, but I do appreciate a restaurant that brews in house!    I've been to BJ's a few times now (different locations) and each visit has included sitting at the bar and sharing apps.   My last visit was no different...  we shared the appetizer platter and it's a perfect size for a few people to share; the portion sizes are really generous and not skimpy.  The best of the bunch was the Avocado Spring Rolls - - perfectly crispy on the outside, creamy avocado on the inside.   Seriously outrageous. This is a good place to enjoy a casual meal, watch the game with some friends or even just grab a beer after all that Outlet Mall shopping!  Maybe during my next visit, I'll try a meal or even that Pizookie that everyone seems to rave about!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-allen?start=120

Travis B.,"Allen, TX",133,65,28,3.0,1/15/2014,"We went on a Tuesday night around 7pm.  Typically we do call ahead, as we did this night and went with a group of 8 to have dinner, and celebrate Codymans 20th Birthday who is in Heaven.  We waited I think a bit long since the place was not busy at all, but I am a pretty patient person, just hungry.  After we got seated our server was stellar and provided TOP notch service.  However, we waited so long for our food, and some came out warm at best, and the pizza our friends got, was not even hot.  We waited mind you over 30 minutes for our food, and on a not so busy night seems not right, and not once did management ask if we were ok.  Our server did continue to bring fresh drinks, and tell us our food would be out, but nothing else.  I feel we have had better service before, and it would be sad if this whole chain is having a lack of service infection.  This is also my 2nd review for BJ's, the other one was in Lewisville.

From there, I had maui fish tacos and my wife had a vegetarian pizza.  I also had a small side salad with the fish tacos.  There were only two fish tacos so I would not necessarily say that I left full. Because I did not leave full, we were talked into a dessert that was a heated berry affair with two scoops of vanilla ice cream that was unreal.  It was very very good.  It has been so long since I have had any hot dessert ice creams.

Shari J.,"Irving, TX",0,4,,1.0,9/1/2015,"Went to the Allen location yesterday with a co-worker for happy hour.  We have a few happy hour items, drinks and then get the bill. My co-worker has the mobile app that allows payment etc.. So after the bill is split between food on one tab and drinks on the other ($12.99 food and $16.99 drinks), I give my card to pay the food tab which I agreed to pay. The server swipes my card and brings back the slips for me to complete the sale. She takes the competed bill I've tipped and signed for and my co-worker stated that they've already paid their check on the mobile app. The server stated that she had to look for the mobile app transaction because she could not see it as competed on her end. She goes back to the computer and brings ME back the check I'VE already had my card swiped for and says that the check paid on the mobile app HAD PAID THE CHECK MY CARD WAS SWIPED FOR and closed the ticket..... So the higher bill was unpaid. Huh? I was  confused as to how another payment was allowed to be processed and closed out on the same ticket whilst another payment was still processing. I also did not understand how she couldn't find the payment from my co-worker but all of a sudden it was closed out and off of her computer. The server said she wasn't sure because of visibility on the mobile app being private. So I was assured that the payment swiped on my card would not process so I paid the $16.99 tab. The manager came over and gave about just as poor of an explanation as the server did of why the mobile app allowed two payments to process on one check but allowed the mobile app to pay and close out the wrong ticket completely. How do you not have any knowledge of the app related to services within your establishment works? Well after the server hands me back the original ticket I thought I was paying for and says that it won't go through because she didn't close the ticket out I am a little peeved because that is not the case. Both transactions were processed on my card... Even though supposedly one check had already been closed out on the app. So I do a little research on the app and see that it allows the person to split the check, pay for whatever they want or NOT pay whatever they want. My co-worker stated that they paid the balance that was left after my card was swiped..Interesting....that would mean the balance would've been $16.99.  So there's a red flag. Where is the disconnect between the mobile app and the restaurant's financial / reimbursement process? How does the app allow a patron to control the closing out of payments? Isn't that the servers job?  BJ's in Allen  Tx owes me an explanation because I'm furious. It's not the difference in bill totals that is my issue; it's the principle and lack of accountability by the staff. Not to mention the mobile app allowing the account holder to divide the check between anyone ordering on the same ticket to their liking/advantage  and giving them the ability to give the illusion that they've divided fairly but actually allows manipulation of the system that has now created a bad taste in my mouth with the restaurant and a suspicion of dishonest behavior from my co-worker. I'm going to contact the technical support for that mobile app and see if I can get my questions answered. I'm sure they have visibilty to transactions that are linked to table or ticket numbers especially when a 20% discount from the app was applied to the sale. What if a stolen credit card was used under a fake profile to pay for a check on their app? I'm going to also write a formal complaint to their corporate office for the lack of training and inability to correct the situation or truly show that they understood their app process in the first place. No app should allow the closing of sale by a patron until all payments have processed accordingly or allow another method of payment to be allowed to process on the same tab simultaneously when there is already a payment still in pending status that has not been cancelled by the MOD. I just want a true explanation and accountability; from all involved if the arrows point in my co-workers direction as well. I am EXTREMELY angry with this situation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-allen?start=140

We had a friend who had flown in from out of town, and we wanted to get some decent eats if possible at this late hour.  It was quickly obvious that they served a limited menu after midnight, and we were very apprehensive to the point of almost leaving, but there aren't that many alternatives in this area, so we stuck it out. They were still serving their always outstanding pizzas plus ""anything fried"", so we chose some buffalo wings and pizzas; all were delicious and cooked to perfection. The pizza had a crisp crust and fresh ingredients, and while the wings could have used some more heat, they did have a good flavor. My Blue Moon beer went down nice and cold, and all in all, we did have a decent experience here despite the limited menu.  I know some will complain about the prices, but I'd rather pay more for good food than less for crappy food.

We lost track of time so i asked the hostess how long was left and this was her reply ""We quoted you 1 hour and its ONLY been EXACTLY 53 minutes so hopefully within 10 minutes."" I asked nicely so I did NOT need attitude. A few minutes later they tell us our table is ready but we would have to site at two different tables. This was a female manager tell us that our group could sit at 2 half circle booths next two each other. Why would we go out as a group to sit separate? This was annoying! Finally we got a table! Server: I do not remember his name sadly but he was great with our group. Drinks: All the drinks we had were great! Our favorites were the Irish Root beer, Strawberry Patch, A Drink Like That (yes that's the name), Throw Back Cherry Cola, house Margarita. Food: Great! Large portions and yummy. I had BBQ pulled pork Sanchez and most of the people had burgers. I also had dessert. The baked bengiet. Almost as good as in New Orleans.

Alex S.,"Frisco, TX",302,293,,4.0,8/25/2011,"If you've never been through the shopping center this location rests in, do yourself a favor and give yourself 15 minutes more time than you think you need to find the place.  You can see it with no trouble from 75 and you'll probably be able to get to it easily... you'll more than likely be stuck behind other drivers not sure of where they're going or what they're looking for since literally every business that has ever existed is within a two-mile radius of this shopping center and you can be sure you'll be stuck behind the guy doing a whopping 5 mph looking for the antique lamp store.  But once you get there, then you have to find parking since this BJ's does a phenomenal amount of business after 6:00 p.m. You'll come in through a revolving door and be in a small waiting room for the crowds that are usually generated - they have benches outside for overflow but if it's a typical day of Texas-style heat, you may be better off finding any standing room you can inside.  The front desk staff has always been attentive and quick to meet your requests if you ask ahead of time (read: if you want to sit in a booth, ask when you put your name in, not when they take you to a table and then you blame them for your own lack of planning).  Speaking of which, one thing you may want to take advantage of is their wait list phone-ahead offer - I believe if you call them before driving out there in the evening, they'll add your name to the wait list upon receiving your call so when you arrive, the wait time is minimal.  And even if it is long, another waiter/waitress can be seen walking through the waiting area with free samples of pizza for customers who have not yet been seated.  Bonus! The place is packed on a regular basis, usually with Allen families, visiting shoppers or folks getting together for whatever random occasion they feel like celebrating then and there.  I always make a beeline for the bar area because not only is it self-seating, but it's elevated above the rest of the place, giving you a great view of two other dining rooms that look like controlled chaos.  There's a number of booths up there and some high-top tables, along with a fairly expansive bar that seats more than you'd initially think when you first see it. A number of ex-Cheesecake Factory executives have made the transition to BJ's in recent years and the food selection shows.  The menu is vast to the point where if you can't find something you want to eat across its many pages, either you were reading it upside down or you decided to declare war on food.  And because it's a brewery, you can be sure they take special pride in their handcrafted beers, which you will hear about when you sit down through the pre-programmed delivery of the host/hostess.  Stick with the Jeremiah Red if you want one of their own, otherwise browse the pages and enjoy some lesser-seen selections (Ugly Pug!). Back to the food, though: it's easy to get overwhelmed by the selections.  Come for lunch and enjoy their special lunch deals (that lunch chicken parmesan is an essential meal).  Split a large pizza with your group (just stay away from the bacon cheeseburger pizza - in the ""mini"" size, I'm pretty sure it's lethal; in a ""large"" size, I'm sure it's illegal to serve).  Chow down on a number of teriyaki dishes, munch on their sandwiches (French dip for the win) and then save room for their famous Pizookie desserts, which sounds like a crime against humanity a la Dr. Frankenstein (what with the blending of ""pizza"" and ""cookie"" into one very holy union) but in reality is a gift from heaven above.  Just be sure and avoid the overly chocolate one and go off the beaten path with a peanut butter cookie in your selection. There's televisions lined throughout the place but if you're expecting to really get engrained in a game, stick to the bar.  The other dining rooms get too crowded for their own good and you don't always have the best view of the TV you're looking for. Plan ahead, get their early, sit in the bar and repeat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-allen?start=160

Unfortunately, the girl that served our food took some plates without asking if we were done. Which had my toddlers muffin on it. This was disappointing and rude if you want to call it serving. Always ask first! Like last time we came we waited 25+ mins for our food. This was VERY crappy, considering we had movie tickets. Which we had to trade for another day and time, while waiting. Mind you this is still my father bday, so we asked about a bday dessert. He ordered one, then the server said they were out of that kind. So he ordered another kind and then we waited another 20 mins. Really??? What crap! As we were leaving, after paying over an $90 dollar bill with tip. I mentioned to the server we never got the damn bday dessert. She said hold while she gets it Togo. Then she came back and said unfortunately it went to another table. If we waited another 2 mins she could get it to go. That was it! 2 mins to get it after 20 mins of waiting and 90$ later? This place and service is a joke. My dad was so let down. I spoke to the manager and all he could say was he was sorry. Really? If you were truly sorry, you would comp our meal or offer something for our second terrible experience.

We were seated quickly & immediately started chugging water.  Poor waitress probably didn't see that craziness coming.  She probably should have just left us a pitcher & saved herself all the trips.  We jumped on order food & started off with an order of the avocado egg rolls, which are great for sharing.  They certainly don't skimp on the avocado & the dipping sauce adds a nice kick to the dish.   For my meal, I went with another appetizer that I hadn't seen before - Thai Lettuce Wraps.  These came with plenty of veggies, a light dipping sauce, and yummy little shrimp.  The lettuce was fresh & large enough to actually hold everything inside.  I hate lettuce wraps that bust apart from the get-go & leave you scooping everything up with your fork.  Honestly, they could stand to give you a few more shrimp on each one, especially since they were the highlight of the dish.  They were smooth, tender, & spicy *yum*  My friend enjoyed his sandwich, too, but I didn't dare try to steal any away from him lest I lose a finger or two in the process. Our waitress was pretty good, too.  She was polite & refilled our drinks with decent speed, though they went dry a few times.  No biggie - we weren't in a rush & she was nice, so it all worked out.   Overall, this place is alright given that they have a big menu, great drink selections, and plenty of space to accomodate a big crowd.  Price wise, it's so-so, really.  An appetizer, two lunches & a soft drink ran us about $40+ after tip.  Don't get me wrong, it's perfectly decent food, though the prices suggest that they are a little proud of it if you ask me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-allen?start=180

Unfortunately we were seated directly under an A/C vent.  It was running full blast (even though it was not that hot out that day) and literally my wife was shaking from the cold.  I swapped places with her and couldn't believe how much air was blowing.  My hair was blowing all around and I have generally short hair.  This had an impact on our food as just a minute or two after it was delivered the food was cold from the A/C vent.  Why they don't have a diffuser is beyond me. My wife had a pizza and I had one of their burgers.  The pizza was bland and had very little sauce.  It can best be described as basically cheese bread.  (My wife has had the pizza many times on 75 and this is a case of night and day--the pizza on 75 is far, far superior.)  My burger was nothing special and I've had better. The service was average, nothing stood out with our waiter and nothing was deficient either.  The bar seemed to be full, but it's hard to say if that was from people waiting for seats or just bar flies hanging out.

The staff was very nice and always brought us everything when we needed it. My glass of root beer was never empty! Speaking of Root Beer, you have to try their homemade version.....it's delicious. I had the fish tacos and they were wonderful! The fish was fried and not too greasy and the seasoning was perfect. The menu is huge with a wide variety of home brewed beers, cocktails, and lots of food.

Michael G.,"McKinney, TX",5,3,2,1.0,6/30/2013,"1pm on a Sunday afternoon. We were given a pager to let us know when our table would be ready. When our pager went off, I handed it to the hostess who wasn't too interested with us. In fact, she took our pager and didn't say ONE WORD  or even make eye contact with me while we stood there waiting for another person to seat us.. Long hard day-I just dismissed it as stress. The waitress was pleasant for the most part. She took our drink and appetizer order and simply told her we would order our food when our appetizer came out as we were waiting for one more person to arrive. Drinks came and she told us our appetizer would be ""right out"". Few minutes later, a server brought it out. As we were enjoying our appetizer our waitress did not come by to take our order. In fact, as she was taking another table's order, we HAD to flag her down to come back and take our order. 2 people in our party ordered a pizza. I ordered ""Fish & Chips"". As I gave her my order, right away she asked me if I wanted ""wedge fries, thin fries, or regular fries"". Told her I wanted ""wedge fries"" along with a side salad. She then asked me if I wanted my salad before or during my meal. I stated that I'd like my salad before. Few minutes passed as we were finishing up our appetizer. She came to refill our drinks at one point. She prepared our table for the arrival of the pizza, and dropped off some ketchup and malt vinegar. Then another time she came to take our appetizer plate away. As she took it away, I asked if my salad was on it's way. She told me it would be right out. How long does it take to make a salad? It took about 10 minutes and me asking before my salad came out... Again, I dismissed it as a stressful, busy day. Couple minutes later, my salad finally came out. At which time she said our food would be right out. 2 bites into my salad my entree arrived. Since I was the only one with an entree (the other's shared a pizza) and I was trying to enjoy my salad, the server asked who the platter was for. With my mouth full of salad, I raised my hand and said it was for me. Just as fast as he set our food out on the table, he was gone. HOWEVER, he brought me ""Shrimp & chips"". Who eats shrimp & chips with malt vinegar?? When I saw our waitress, I flagged her down and told her I was brought shrimp & chips instead of fish & chips. She then reached down and grabbed the plate and told me she would bring it back with no apology or anything. At this point, I'm thinking this establishment needs a serious ""customer service"" adjustment. She came right back and finally apologized and told me my food would be right out. She brought my food out and everything seemed fine and dandy. HOWEVER, I expected a simple explanation or another apology about the mishap. but it never came.  When this happened (unfortunately) before at the Alliance location we've had a manager come out and apologize for the error. We were even offered a free pizookie. The Allen location didn't seem to care. In fact, after signing the receipt she said thanks for coming, and mumbled her way away from the table. We didn't know exactly what she said because she wasn't focused on us but focused more on the next table.And Not ONCE did she acknowledge her mistake again, or tryto make up for it. Granted she did come out (eventually) with the correct plate, she made us think we we're in the way or were bothersome.  Lack of customer service and courtesy is the reason why we tipped only 10%. My rating would've been 5 stars because of the food, but the lack of ""CUSTOMER SERVICE"" deserves minus 4 stars as we we're NOT happy I'll come back to this location, but I seriously hope to get better customer service and never get that awful waitress again. On this visit, CUSTOMER SERVICE was severely lacking. I hope to never experience that again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-allen?start=180
Barb N.,"McKinney, TX",32,219,97,4.0,1/22/2012,"Today, I was in the mood for something light.  Ahi poke sounded good and it was...Delicious!  We started the meal with a couple of beers.  I really enjoyed the franzar... hefeweisse dunkel.  It was so good with everything we ordered.  We shared the fried artichokes.  They are very very good!  The batter was very tastey with tartness of the artichoke.  Ahi poke is diced sushi grade tuna with avocado on a liitle julianned cabbage and the soy based poke sauce served with fried won ton triangles.  I love it!  My husband ordered a little salad with blue cheese dressing...kinda disappointing...iceberg lettuce, bleh.  Next came his ribeye with mashed potatoes.  Holy cow, that was wonderful!  Mm mm good.  The steak was a wonderful beefy smokey flavor and texture.  Steak is not usually my thing but I like to take a bite each time he gets one!  This was one of my favorites.  The steak and mashed potatoes were a perfect pair.  There was a hint of horseradish in the potatoes and they were so thick and creamy.  It was so good he gave me several bites of both.  YUM! This was by far the best meal I have had at BJs.  SO GOOD!  I can't wait to go back.  We may order the exact same thing again. Normally I would order the avocado eggrolls and possibly share a little pizza.  Although you can't go wrong with those, I'm glad I strayed from the norm today. Our server was named Kyle.  Good guy, great server.   The little salad brought my rating down.  If it weren't for that, this visit would have gotten 5 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-allen?start=200

Katsya A.,"Lubbock, TX",0,8,,5.0,5/3/2012,"Food is the exact same at both Allen and Frisco location. We originally had went to the Frisco location since it is closer to my boyfriend's place, but we had some seriously rude service there... stiff body language, curt short answers, eye rolling, deep sighing while I looked over the menu one more time after my boyfriend had ordered...after my appetizers were dropped off, my boyfriend suggested that we call a different server over and have him get us our check for the drinks and small plates that I had ordered and to cancel his entree. Yeah. It was that bad. I really enjoyed my chicken wontons, but that waiter really put a damper on our evening. So I finished them quickly, we got our check, paid, we left. I really like BJ's food, so we decided to drive over to Allen. We were seated immediately, and our waiter Brandon more than made up for our crappy waiter in Frisco. He kept saying ""my pleasure"", which I thought was kinda endearing/a mark of a new waiter, but that's neither here nor there. He was so adorable and prompt. I had ordered a few small plates for my meal (more thai chicken wontons!), and a few minutes later, he came back to ""regretfully inform [me]"" that the kitchen was out of chicken wontons and ""would [I] like a menu to see if [I] wanted something else"".  I've worked in restaurants, I understand that things run out. The way he handled it was so very professional and empathetic--he didn't roll his eyes or sigh once while I looked over the menu some more to pick out a different dish. No tapping of his feet, no deep sighing, nothing to indicate that he had ""better things to do"" than wait on me. I finally decided to go with some stuffed mushrooms instead of wontons, to which he said ""my pleasure"" and he hurried away to go put that order in.  Stuffed mushrooms were delicious, my other small plates were tasty (the meatballs have a liiiiiiiiiittle too much pepper in their marinara sauce), but that was easy to overlook with such a fabulous waiter. I'll be back and request you, Brandon. Please make sure ya'll have chicken wontons in stock! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-allen?start=200

victoria j.,"Gaithersburg, MD",24,84,163,3.0,5/31/2010,"In general, BJ's has the best food and brewed-on-site beer, but I have to say I was a little disappointed with the Mediterranean pizza I had this time around. It was way too salty for my taste and it must've had a lot of msg b/c my body was dehydrated after that meal. As always, I had the Jeremiah red. This is a very strong red beer, a little on the bitter side, so watch out if you're the driver. If you haven't tried their beers, you may want to get the sampler and try 4 miniature beers. I tried the oreo pizookie for dessert (oven baked brownie topped with ice cream), but it was way too sweet. I should've stuck to my normal oatmeal pizookie.

It started of not out of the norm for a Friday night we were told the wait would be 45 mins.  Well an hour later I asked how much longer and was told we were next on the list. 20 more mins and we were finally seated. We thought finally we are so hungry now we can order. Well another 20 mins we finally saw our waiter placed our drink order and I guess should have placed food order then too. It took 15 mins to get sodas and waters and he didn't stop to take the order then either. It was anoted 10 mins before he came back to take the order.  The food actually came pretty quick not surprising since half the place was empty now. I had wedge salad and a pizza.  The wedge salad was tiny to say the least but the pizza was ok.  It will be a long time before I come back to visit this location.  So all in all it took an hour and half to get a table, 40 mins to even place the food order an about 15 mind for it to arrive.
