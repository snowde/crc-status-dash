Jeanne T.,"Porterville, CA",4,145,468,4.0,12/23/2017,"I have not been in for a long time. Just always trying ""locals spots lately"". Decided,  to give it a go. I'm glad I did. The food was great, atmosphere was happening, and service was good. Beer selection was good. They have decent craft beer, but I prefer the craft brewery scene. The only down is the price, not cheap eats here. But all in all worth our money. I got lunch for next day!  Good visit, I will definitely come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bakersfield
Ezra A.,"Ridgecrest, CA",4,17,6,5.0,11/22/2017,"came here with friends tonight & got the best service ever by ANDREW. he made wonderful recommendations about the prime rib & sides dishes. i almost thought he was too good to be true because of how friendly & quick-paced he is, but he deserves a standout in this review because of his genuine passion for his work! give this man a raise!  & as always, the pizookie is to die for! i'm one happy girl right now.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bakersfield
Jeff N.,"Nakaniikawa District, Japan",96,5,1,2.0,8/30/2017,The only reason they're getting two stars is because they have beer. That's it. Service was horribly slow and unfriendly. Items that my wife and I loved are off the menu (chicken nachos) replaced by cheap imitations.  Everything has gone down since we first came here. I AINT NEVA GOIN BACK. Fuck outta my face.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bakersfield
Chandi M.,"Kern County, CA",31,66,258,4.0,8/7/2017,What can I say the food is just so so and if your going to order any kind of seafood it's going to be overcooked. The Ahi Poke is good but the portion of fish vs avocado is not equal. Overall it's an ok place but it is a brewery so just enjoy the drinks.  Update: I have returned a few more times sense this review and the service and food has improved a lot. The Pita Chicken tacos are amazing and the clam chowder I tried today was delicious.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bakersfield

The service was good and the food came fast, that was great since we were on a schedule. The food was great also, although I wouldn't order the blistered shishitos  again since they lacked seasoning.

Came in on Saturday late  afternoon and was seated promptly. We split a flight and I ordered Belching Beaver Peanut Butter milk stout.  Hubby got the a hickory brisket bacon burger with wedge fries. He liked it very much. I tried the late night burger served  open face with wedge fries. It had patty, chile verde sauce, fried egg,  bacon, and cheddar. Delicious! Nice kick to it.

Frank B.,"Hawthorne, CA",1,15,2,1.0,12/24/2017,"1st and last time I will ever eat at this BJs location. Where to begin? 1st, we were delayed being seated because they hadn't placed menus on the table. This was complete b.s. The reason we weren't seated is because they didn't have enough chairs for our table. Which we reserved. 2nd, they botched the salads that were ordered. One never came at all. 3rd, there was no rhythm to the food being delivered, so a few received their food, while others did not. Of the 7 entrees ordered, 4 were wrong. They comped 2 of the four then promised coupons for free desserts. They gave us 2.  Service was crap, food was cold, manager completely inept.  We turned away 7 items that were not ordered by our table. It was the worst dinner experience I've had in years.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bakersfield

I went with the derby Cobb salad, it was huge. It was probably the best Cobb salad I've ever had. But I couldn't finish it, because it was so big. I brought the rest of it home for my husband and he loved it as well. Service was good and so was the atmosphere!

A C.,"Bakersfield, CA",2,57,31,1.0,12/1/2017,"Went here last night with a friend.  All I wanted was soup.  Friend got the zitti pasta thing.   Service:  horrible.  It seems like around 7:15pm the place was so packed the wait staff were overwhelmed and couldn't handle the tables.  Wasn't sure who our waiter was as we got 5 different people come and drop stuff off and walk away without even stopping to ask if we needed anything.  YES I NEEDED A PLACE SETTING!! YES I NEEDED A NAPKIN!!!! YES I WANTED MY WATER GLASS REFILLED.  NONE OF THAT HAPPENED!!  waiter was very stand-offish and short as if he was in a rush to go somewhere when he came to take our order.   I got the soup.  When ordering I asked that it be hot.  Nope.  Came to the table barely Luke warm and thick as porridge.  Whatever.  I asked for tobacco from the dude doing the drop and dash and never got it.   Soup was mush like.  Edible but hey it was late and I just wanted out at that point.  I mean it's cold outside.  Why bring over barely like warm soup that's as thick as porridge when I asked for hot soup when ordering.  Horrible service.  Shit I'm lucky it came with a damn spoon at least.   I'd never recommend this joint to anyone.  It's packed, loud and service is horrible!!!

I was ready to order when she came back with our drinks.  She did a great job of keeping drinks full and making sure everything was perfect through out the dining experience.   I only gave 4 stars because food took a little over 20 minutes to arrive. I tried a new item tonight from their ""enlightened"" section; the Mediterranean chicken pita tacos with a side of their quinoa vegetable medley and it is now my favorite item!  The chicken tacos came with red onions, feta cheese and cilantro tossed in red wine vinaigrette, I'm not a fan of Greek yogurt creme so I got that on the side.  This would be a perfect lunch, they also have a couple vegetarian option which also looked really good.  It was overall a great visit and I only spent $21 for two entrees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bakersfield
Dan M.,"Bakersfield, CA",10,95,16,4.0,5/10/2017,"Been here many many times. My family usually come here for special occasions. I have quite a few pint glasses from Fathers Day visits. Came here for a pre birthday dinner with the family since i could not celebrate it on the actual day. My daughter gets her usual, a brew house burger, wife gets a chicken club and my son gets a extreme pepperoni pizza. But i like to explore the vast menu. I have had the jambalaya, bison burgers, fish and chips. But i decided to try the enlightened barbacoa chicken. Its chicken over brown rice and black beans. It was pretty good, would do again. We also had the Pizookies, they are $3.00 on Tuesdays. Always good, we tried the white chocolate macadamia. The only thing I don't really like is that they charge $3.00+ per drink. I mean soda and tea, not alcohol of any kind. No tea or soft drink should be over $3.00.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bakersfield?start=20

Larry H.,"Los Angeles, CA",119,352,32,1.0,2/20/2017,"I have frequented many BJ's up and down the coast and I can honestly say that our experience at this establishment was by far the worst. First off we order our appetizers, the stuffed mushrooms, and the queso/chips.  When they arrived, everything was cold.  The Queso was gritty like it had sand in it and tasted like Velveeta cheese, cold Velveeta cheese.  Gross!!!!!! I brought this to the attention of our waitress and it was ' an oh well attitude' and walked away.  Nothing was done about this.  Very poor customer service! I asked for a side salad with no croutons and extra tomatoes and cucumbers.  I was brought out a regular salad with everything just the opposite of what I asked for.  Again, no attention to detail.   The tortilla soup was the poorest excuse for tortilla soup I have ever seen.  There was not one tortilla and it was mainly a broth.  Again, terrible QC! The ribs tasted like day old re-fried ribs and far from fresh!  Poor presentation and even worse, it was like eating a dry old dog bone! When you go out to eat, I understand mistakes happen, however on our visit, all the marks were missed completely by the staff.  Poor customer service and poor QC/quality/freshness of the food.  Ugg!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bakersfield?start=20

I went to the restroom prior to sitting down at the table.  The toilet paper dispensers were all empty. Why aren't these being refilled at the end of the night? I literally walked to each stall and no toilet paper in sight. Not good.  I washed my hands, didn't use the toilet and proceeded on to my table.  I ordered the unlimited soup and salad. I got the wedge salad and tomato bisque soup. Both were really good, and this is the experience I remember.  Our server was attentive we were in and out in a decent amount of time and satisfied from the meal.   I hope the bathroom issue was only a one off, such a bummer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bakersfield?start=20

Eric E.,"Bakersfield, CA",10,70,125,2.0,7/14/2017,"This place embodies all that's wrong with big chain restaurants. Warmed over food from a frozen bag. No theme to the menu. Just everything.

Jesus O.,"Bakersfield, CA",25,5,5,3.0,11/18/2017,This was my first time here since it opened. Let me start by saying  great food nice atmosphere. The only thing that killed my veterans day celebration was my waiter Martin seemed kind of a snob. No mattered how much I tried to be nice or joke with him all he would give me is a courtesy smile.

Clarinda D.,"Bakersfield, CA",118,2,,5.0,10/14/2017,Awesome beer and appetizers. My boyfriend and i wanted to grab a snack and beer so we went to The Firehouse. We walked in and it felt so weird and unfriendly. Being a server myself i knew that easnt a good feeling but hey you never know so we tried asking if we seat ourselves could barley get anyone to acknowledge us so we sat down waited ablut 5 mins and yep we walked out and not one person said one word to us. Thank you to our server/bartender at BJ's for making us feel like we were welcomed. Jake was awesome and helped us with everything. Again. Amazing food and amazing service. Thank you Jake!

Johnny Q.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,2,1,1.0,12/25/2017,"We went for my Dad's 76th Birthday. About 2:00 or so. My sister Beverly called ahead, however when we showed up they had no record of her calling. Surprise, not!! The waitress was changed almost immediately and they sent another person to serve us. Me and my Dad ordered the bison burger with fries. Medium well. My sister ordered the Mediterranean Chicken Tacos. The burgers arrived and they were absolutely RARE! I had about half the fries as my Dad. My sisters chicken tacos were fish tasting. Yuk! We showed the waitress our raw burgers and my sister explained her discontent with the fishy tasting chicken tacos. The waitress said she would show her manager and they would remake the burgers for me and my Dad. My sister ordered s chicken sandwich meal instead. The food finally came and now the burgers were well done and burnt . My burger was partially well done and raw in some parts. My Dad's burger was extremely overcooked to the point it was so much smaller than before! The salsa was basically obsolete and missing for his, just one plop of salsa and almost a half onion on his burger? Wow I mean Wow! My sisters chicken sandwich was fine. We informed the waitress and they comped our burgers and the chips and guacamole. The Manager did apologize the first time but no apology for the second time. We ended up paying for my sisters chicken sandwich and the drinks only. I will needless to say that I definitely will not never return here for anything involving food! Absolutely the worst experience ever. The cook is not a cook at all. I myself haven't been a chef for sometime, but I could still do much better than what we received that day. Please tell all your friends to never set foot in this restaurant. You will do yourself a big favor. If I could give negative stars I would. One star for service only. I can't express enough that this was absolutely just horrible. I say no thank you very very much if I ever am invited to go again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bakersfield?start=20
Mrs. P.,"Bakersfield, CA",16,64,5,1.0,6/22/2017,"I've had pleasant dining experiences while dining in the restaurant. My review is solely for take-out. Never have I arrived to pick up my order and had it handed to me without waiting at least another 10 mins. Not once. Never. Ever. Doesn't matter what day it was or what time it was. It was never ready.  My kids love the kids meals, so we order take-out often. Specifically, once a week for the past 6 weeks, and several times before that. After the first few times that I arrive and had to wait, I started stretching the pick up time out longer. It was a game I was playing with myself. Order, wait 15 mins. Go. Order. Wait 20 mins. Go. Order wait 25 mins. Go. It didn't matter how long I waited, my order was never ready.  The last straw was this past Saturday. I ordered my food, showed up 30 mins later and still had to wait another 7-8 mins. I get home (3 mins later) and the food was awful! Cold, salty and my daughter's cheese pizza had no cheese on it. It was just sauce and bread. She took two bites and left it.  I will never order take out of BJ's again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bakersfield?start=20
Garrett G.,"Bakersfield, CA",52,20,18,4.0,8/3/2017,Wife and I are always a fan of their chicken tortilla soup. The flavor is incredible. Sometimes I do wish it comes out hotter but that is okay.

Hansel B.,"Bakersfield, CA",1,3,,4.0,6/23/2017,"BJ's is by far one of my top, if not the top restaurant in Bakersfield. I have been here several times and i can't say that i have ever had a bad experience. The staff for the most part is very attentive and the waiters really do their absolute best to cater to their customers. The only reason that this review is not a 5 star is for (2) reasons.  1) No shock top beer. For being a brewery id assume they'd have a variety of all types of beer.  2) It wouldn't hurt for their hostesses to be more welcoming as customers are walking in. Typically if their backs are against the front door, you have to get their attention to be seated. Other than that this place is great and i overall recommend it to anyone who is looking for good food and a good environment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bakersfield?start=20
Cheyenne C.,"Bakersfield, CA",14,38,31,3.0,11/11/2016,Come here last night. We wanted to sit at the bar area but there were no tables the ones that were available were not cleaned.  The host said he would recommend us standing by the table so that a busser knows we want the table cleaned off. Which instantly annoyed me. I don't want to stand by a dirty table it would be nice if you could go tell the busser to clean the table .  As we were standing in the waiting area a server as if we had been helped I said yes we are waiting for a table to be clean in the bar. She said the same thing she would recommend a standing by the table until a busser comes.  After about 15 minutes of standing there I asked what looks like a manager if he could get a busser to clean a table off for us.  He apologized and cleaned the table off for us. Which I appreciated.  I got a personal $4(happy hour) panned pizza. Soo yummy & filling for only $4!!!

And the pizza is ridiculously salty and I love salt but this was too much. They have almost no sauce on the pizza. And they used to have big chunks of tomatoes in their sauce and now they don't and they don't have the option to add tomatoes on their website. This will be the last time I get a bjs pizza.

The service was deplorable! Slow. We had to flag her down constantly. Asked for more chips 5 times by the time we finally got them our spinach artichoke dip was completely cold and coagulated. The waitress was awful from the very beginning and she even came to take orders and we were on different tickets and she took one order and left we had to scream after her to come back to us and take more orders because other people wanted order besides just two of us.  Everything was painfully slow we had to fight for every single thing we got and the food was greasy and nasty. To top off what was an awful experience she told us we could not use the coupons that we had presented before the meal even though she had told us that we could. So she lied to us at the very beginning of the meal and waited till we were completely done and told us she was going to charge us anyway.  If it had not been for the fact that I did not want to ruin my son's graduation lunch and any more than it already had been I would have thrown a fit! Then to top it all off she was so frustrated with her little handheld electronic device that she was using to swipe our cards that she literally punched it over and over again before storming off.

The bbq chicken pizza is unique, quite a nice pizza.  First time we ordered soft drinks, when the bill came we were charged like six bucks or more. They only got us once on that. Can we afford three dollar soft drinks? Probably so, we both work 50 plus hours each week. But if we want to spend three dollars on soft drinks we will buy a 12 pack. So we just drink water.

Jennifer B.,"Bakersfield, CA",49,70,182,4.0,3/31/2016,"So I just want to start off by saying I frequent Bjs quite often and I always get the ahi salad. I have noticed that each time it's different! It is still really good, however I swap out the dressing it comes with to the sweet tamarind sauce that comes with the avocado egg rolls. Each time something is different, more or less avocado, smaller or larger cuts of tomatoes, some times there is red bell pepper and some times there isn't, and the seasoning and sear of the tuna is always different!!!! Also take out portion is substantially smaller then what you receive if you dine in.  Not cool !! But I still love it. I just wish the consistency could be improved upon. The drinks and beer selection are awesome! The times I have tried bits of other peoples food have been really good too! The atmosphere is really cool I love the mirrors they have above some of the booths super retro looking in my opinion and the servers really seem to love their jobs and are always attentive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bakersfield?start=40

Our appetizer order was taken and our drinks brought out quickly, then our orders taken. From here it went downhill.....  Our salads were brought out wrong but immediately corrected by Lupe with an apology. Our food was brought out - mine with the wrong side, which again was corrected by Lupe pretty quickly, but the kitchen mustve been kinda pissy cuz it came out scorched. She again brought me another side of sprouts, this time not burned. As my date ate his meal, he said it tasted weird - he turned over the piece of chicken to find it also burned....as was our friends ( both had the parmesean crusted chicken ) it looked as if it had been coated in coffee grounds?? They scraped it off and assured our server it was okay - but I know its not the way it should be. About this time I noticed that my Calif chicken club sandwich had no avacado ....again, we had to bother Lupe. She brought it immediately. As she was doing so, our waters were refilled, and my friends Sprite was filled with water....an innocent mistake but on top of the other issues, just a bad experience.

This time it was anything but amazing.  The rice was so undercooked....I took 3 bites and all 3 bites contained grains of rice crunching and breaking on my mouth. I brought it to the waitresses attention and asked her to take it back.  What I got instead was an empty plate they told me I could keep my chicken on since it was fine and they would bring me replacements for the rest. I was brought a small cup of rice and a small cup of black beans to put under the chicken on the new plate. The rice was cooked this time and that's all well and good....however in doing so the new plate had no feta cheese, no cilantro, and no salsa. It was just a piece of chicken with rice and beans. That isn't the dish I ordered and I was really disappointed with the staffs' resolution to the problem, I would have been fine keeping the original chicken if they had prepared a new plate for me with the rice, beans, cheese, cilantro, and salsa so I got the dish I ordered.

Peter P.,"Bakersfield, CA",407,257,2142,3.0,4/8/2016,"BJ's is one of those restaurants for me that sits right in the middle of my mind when thinking of where to eat.  The middle and the reason is that it is not bad nor exciting so I almost want to say it gets forgotten.  One of the odd things is that BJ's apparently has some good craft beers, I drink beer but for some odd reason I have yet to try one here.       The food is good, some better than others and it only goes from what I have tried of course.  I never order the pizzas but my wife and kids like them and when they have ordered them I've tried and liked them as well but not enough to order for myself.  One of the things I really liked but they do not offer in the same manner is their baked potatoes.  It has been a while, but before they would be gigantic baked potatoes and that would be my meal.  However a few visits ago I ordered this and it was a regular sized potato, not something that would be a meal, at least for me.        My most recent visit was for lunch with my wife and I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken with mashed potatoes.  The chicken was a boneless breast that was cooked really well and had great flavor, but the mashed potatoes just fell short for me.  My wife ordered a pizza and I grabbed a slice, it was good but yet again, not something I'd order for me.      The service can be inconsistent from each visit I've had here, the last one not so well.  Our waiter took our drink order, then our food order but then went missing for a good 20 minutes.  Other people who were seated after us received their food, some waited on by the same person, some were not.  My question is, if some of the other people ordered what I ordered (chicken), how do they get their food before me?  That is a question that irks me, especially on a lunch time limit since we both were needing to return to work.  I can't for sure what happened, so I chalk it up to a one-time occurrence but it still is annoying.      BJ's is a nice place to eat whether lunch, dinner or just a snack with a beer.  There are times that it can get really packed and wait times are long, but it is nothing different than other restaurants of the same style.  They do have a mobile app that will let you order your food so when you arrive, it will be almost done if not waiting for you.  I think you get a discount for the first order you place and I think you can reserve on it too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bakersfield?start=60

Warm it up, put it in a bowl, throw on some toppings to make it pretty, done. I was wrong, so wrong. I thought I ordered soup, but I guess I ordered broccoli cheddar pudding and a tomato mozzarella salad instead. I requested to change my soup to tomato bisque (or whateva) and it came out suspiciously quick. The oil was separating the soup making it look like liquid cellulite *yum* I barely even took 2 bites of that. What. A. Waste. I'm giving 2 stars because our waiter was a trooper. Super nice and he didn't question my request to change soups (but he should've questioned that pudding).

Our waitress was super nice to begin with but you can tell the busy-ness was wearing her down.  Our food took a while to come out and we could tell because it tasted like it had been sitting there a while.  We ordered the Chicken Parmesan, avocado egg rolls, chicken wings, the fried artichokes & the kid's mini corn dogs. The avocado rolls I love so much disappointed me tonight. They tasted extra oily, I only had one. Everything else tasted luke-warm.

My mother in law asks for sweetener for the iced tea...and #2 waiter never brings it.

This means a 25 minute delay in food and the tea never gets sweet. Bob reappears, apologizes and leaves  the wrong tab.

I always receive exceptional service from the servers there and most of them know my order because I order the same thing everytime which is pasta and a salad. On Saturday, September 24th, I went to BJ's a little after 4 pm for dinner and my server (I believe her name is Gina,) asked me what I would like to order. I told her Fetuccini Alfredo with Penne pasta, blackened chicken on it, no broccoli and a side salad with only spinach leaves. During my giving her my order, she gets out her pad to start writing the order down and said to me ""Wow, that's a lot of food for 1 person.   Upon her seeing the look of anger and frustration, she tried to backtrack by telling me that is not what she meant. I told her I did not want to hear it, told her to get away from me and requested another server. I was humiliated by her comment as there were a lot of people in the original section I was in. I asked to be seated away from other people, spoke to the manager and got another server Merlin who was very kind. My review is not from a personal standpoint, but rather a customer service standpoint. I am beyond tired of crap customer service and in this instance, Gina was on the job serving customers, so that negates her being able to voice her personal opinion on how much or how little food a paying customer orders. While Merlin was very nice and gracious, the above scenario ruined my overall experience this time. And because of all of this unnecessary crap, they failed to add my reward points for this meal as I had asked them to originally. Update: My concerns were graciously addressed by BJ's management, reward points added  and I am extremely appreciative of their efforts to right a wrong. I will remain a customer of BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bakersfield?start=80

Penny L.,"Bakersfield, CA",210,188,471,3.0,12/25/2014,"BJ's has consistently decent food for a chain restaurant. They've got a great variety and a decent selection at the bar.  A vodka tonic will set you back $8.50 though, which I feel is SUPER overpriced.  Tomato, mozzarella, balsamic, red onion salad is the BEST. It's tossed with fresh basil and is excellent. This is big enough to be a meal, tbh.  Balsamic glazed chicken is great. Comes with garlic mashed potatoes, shoestring onion rings, and some greens.  Tomato basil bisque is pretty good. Clam chowder is okay, but I'm not a big clam chowder fan anyway.  Any pizza you put together is gonna be excellent. Their sauce is a little too sweet for my liking, but alas.  I've always liked all of their fish I've had, too. Good pasta selection.  Everything here is very, very heavy on sodium, fyi. I know a lot of you try to watch it.  However, our service was so crappy I'm tempted to just give it three stars. 35 minutes to take our order. They weren't busy. When I asked for a lime wedge for my vodka tonic (they usually come standard, why did I even have to ask??) it took nearly ten minutes to get them. By that time, most of the ice had melted.  She took our menus away without taking our order. In the ten minutes between that and when she finally came back to get our order, we had forgotten what we wanted and what they were called. When we expressed we weren't sure we were ordering the right thing, she didn't want to walk over and get us menus again! She played the guessing game instead for a few minutes. Super, SUPER annoying.  It took her nearly 20 minutes to get our bill. Another 10 for her to come and take our card.  Now that I am remembering my frustration, I'm taking them down to three stars.

The server we had was good to start. We got our food and then he disappeared. When he returned it was only to ask if we wanted dessert. He then brought us the check. We waited for him for about 20-25 minutes to come and get the check along with the gift card.

My wife order the Rib Eye which was cooked the way she preferred Medium Rare. It had a great char on the outside and nice m/r juicy color on the inside.

For a chain I really like this place and it's large offerings on their menu. They offer a large selection of appetizers and small bites with my favorites being the cheese sticks, avocado egg rolls, or artichokes. There broccoli cheddar soup is very good and the extra cheese on top makes it even better. My favorite dish is the Parmesan crusted chicken and I get it almost every time I go. Plus who can resist a Pazookie??? They have this heavenly one with chocolate, peanut butter, marshmallow, and ice cream. Sooo good! They have a wide selection of beer although I'm not much of drinker but I will say their craft soda selection is pretty good. I usually go for the classic root beer but the others are tasty too. My kids love it here too with the wide selection of kids meals as well which makes dining with them easier. I have always had friendly wait staff and the one time something was wrong it was fixed promptly and a discount was given. One major plus that this restaurant offers is call ahead seating and reservations for larger parties!!!!

Listening skills not the best. Ordered a lemon drop. Seriously watery. Hubby said beer sampler was good and cold. Decent selection of beer.  Not sure how much of an actual 'brewpub' this is. Ordered a deep dish pizza. Was honestly overwhelmed at how large the menu is. Too much stuff. A novel read. So, we went with what they started out with thinking that would be good. First off the pizza was cold. The tomatoes were canned. There was no sauce on the spicy Hawaiian chicken. I did like the chicken chunks and the crust but would order differently next time. NOT spicy. Had to ask for cutlery, napkins and no seasonings accompanied the pizza. Maybe sitting at a regular table would have worked out better with a server.

I noticed that they have added a few more ""healthier"" options, which is great given how caloric their signature items can be.  I ordered their bison burger, that comes with a small side salad, and an iced tea (no beer for me this afternoon!) I 86'd the bun bc I knew Id be having a carb-loaded dinner later that evening.  She asked if I wanted it lettuce wrapped, and I love that more places are doing this.  My burger was cooked to order, always a good thing.   My dad had the bacon burger and subbed a wedge salad for the fries; there is a charge to do this.  He enjoyed his meal.

James D.,"Bakersfield, CA",21,108,,2.0,9/28/2015,"""Watch your step."" BJ's reminds me that customer service is dead.  We live in an era where, in the cost vs. benefit equation, it's more profitable for a restaurant to invest in moving units/product than establishing relationships between companies and customers. And that makes sense because why should a company invest in competent employees when they can procure more profit by hiring quick and selling fast. The truth is that BJ's would rather have ten unhappy customers than two regular customers because on either side of the analysis, they still got paid.  To that effect, employees here don't go above and beyond. They aren't paid to do that. They exhume their motivation: Good performance means doing just enough not to get fired. And should we blame them? In Post Recession America, where men and women who devoted decades of their lives to companies only to get terminated or laid off, loyalty is dead. And loyalty always means that employees will do their best for the customers because value between an employee and a company are mutual.  I have been to BJ's many times. Food is cheap (relatively) and satisfying. But service is deplorable. And that's okay because I don't expect much out of anyone anymore and I mean that about all companies across the board. I can't remember the last time I walked into a restaurant or store and encountered an employee and thought, ""Wow they treated me with respect and work hard."" Instead I can't even get yogurt without some asinine late teens high schooler giving me attitude because she has to actually work on a Friday night instead of getting hyphy with her friends.

Contrary to the reviews, the service was good.   The food on the other hand was typical chain food (think Applebees).  I figured having never been to BJ's before, I'd try one of their famous pizzas.   A 9"" ""The Works"" sounded like it would suffice.   Oven-baked meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, black olives, white onions and seasoned tomatoes.  The pizza tasted not far off from Stouffers frozen pizza you can pick up at aisle 5 at your local supermarket.  To make things worse, BJ's has all of the caloric values of the food they serve listed on the menu.  You can now see why America is bursting at the seams!  Make no mistake, this place is a haven for high calorie food.   Nearly everything on the menu is loaded with calories.   Interested in their famous ""pizookie"" -- that'll set you back 1088 calories and 115% of your daily saturated fat intake , fat boy.  That's  over 50% of the recommended caloric intake for the average American.   Oink oink America!   If you're looking for the ""Applebee's of pizza places"" - you'll find it at BJ's Restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bakersfield?start=160

And fast servings except on weekend.  Their appetizers are very delicious and my favorite one is the avocado egg roll. I have to order this every time I go in there.  I recommend this restaurant to everyone I know. Updated 3/5/2015 Their food is getting so bad. I used to love their avocado egg rolls. Last time I ordered it. It has no seasoning plus it wasn't cooked right.  I also ordered the Santa Fe salad and the garden vegetable baked potato. The salad had way too much seasoning and salty which it's odd. And the veggie potato was empty except of some great beans. so it was a garden vegetables potato without vegetables.  It was really my favorite restaurant in town I used to come three to four times a month.  but why is that big change in the food quality.  Please be careful to your cooker bcz you will loose more customers.  Updated  4/3/2016 I can't stop coming here. And the service is back to 5 stars.

The parm chicken was bitter and leathery so I switched my mom and gave her my burger I just didn't want to change the happy birthday mood. Still I couldn't even get to the second piece of the chicken and left it in the plate. To top it off I had actually told the waiter to tell the chef that the parm chicken is for the birthday lady over here so he can take care of her order extra special. I guess he did the other way. The late night burger was soggy and had a ton of chille verde sauce in it which we didn't appreciate, also wasn't finished ... I ordered a drink twice and ended up getting it right before we left! We were told that they were short handed and so they were courteous about taking it back. So didn't really eat much and didn't get a drink to begin with. They also took out one of two appetizers were ordered from our tab, hence, the 1 star. Ended up with a $70 bill and didn't enjoy anything from what we ordered.

Oddly, the problem is the size and seating capacity. Every single time I have been here, it was packed, and due to the high number of people, and low number of staff on duty at any given time, problems usually arise. Twice my table was given an order that was totally wrong, and one of those times our order was burned, only to be replaced with another wrongly ordered pizza. The staff IS very accommodating though, and like I mentioned the food is delicious, regardless of what you order. Both times this occurred we were totally reimbursed and both the incorrect and replaced order were covered by the restaurant, which is nice. For night such as Friday or Saturday, this place would probably be best in terms of quality, but low on the list in terms of ease. The establishment itself is pretty stressful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bakersfield?start=200

Figuring we can sit there for hours we will simply be ignored, we walked out and on the way out we told the hostess we are leaving since no waitress came to the table after sitting there for over half an hour. She apologized and went to get the manager. Waited a few more minutes for the manager to come out. She offered to seat us again.... really? for sure?

Balon N.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,107,441,1.0,8/26/2015,"Disappointed. This is usually a great chain. Beer was good as usual (well, it comes from a very consistent brewry in Reno. So not really a brew pub). Avocado rolls were just OK. Not crispy, a bit oily - my guess the oil wasn't hot enough. Chicken Lemon Thyme - while sounded healthy was totally inedible. The dish tasted liked burnt rubber, was soaked in sauce and the chicken was so weired it felt like a squid or what I'd imagine a dense flip flop soaked in lemon would taste like.

That would have been alright if the waitress hadn't just thrown everything on the table and took off every time. I mean come on I may need something this one time you have talked to us. I guess someone ran out of the bar without paying their bill so we got to wait another 30 minutes while the whole staff talked about it. Mind you my bill is $85 and I can't even get service.

Gwenyth F.,"Bakersfield, CA",55,41,16,4.0,6/27/2014,"BJ's is probably one of my favorite chain restaurants. I love the food, the service (usually), and the atmosphere. But the wait time can be atrocious.  As for the food, for the appetizer I like the Santa Fe Rolls and the mozzarella sticks, but I recommend the appetizer platter too.  I will say that the mozzarella sticks aren't as good as they used to be. For the entrees, the best ones are the pastas, the Southwest chicken salad, and the pizzas. My favorite deep dish is the classic, pepperoni, but the pizza is expensive. My sister, who has celiac disease, can't eat wheat, so this is one of the few places that serves pizza she can eat. For dessert, order a Pizzookie. The best ones are the salted caramel, white chocolate chunk, and the best one: chocolate chip. I went to BJ's last night with my friend and her mom. Her birthday is tomorrow, so we asked if we could get a Pizzookie. Our waitress was very nice and brought out one. Turns out, they were out of the mini they usually give, so we got a bigger one for free. We looked behind us, and the table behind us had an ENORMOUS Pizzookie. It was the biggest Pizzookie on the menu. It was the size of a extra large pizza with four different sections of different flavors and 8 scoops of ice cream. It cost $20, but it would've been worth it for a group. It's officially on my bucket list.

Christopher P.,"San Francisco, CA",0,11,,2.0,1/17/2015,"TL:DR Decent food, mixed drinks, poor service Visited Here for my sister's birthday dinner. I hadn't been for about 2 years but remember loving the place back in my high school and college years.  The Wait was kind of long due to school formals, but my sister scheduled ahead of time so we were seated almost immediately.  For beverages, I ordered BJ's root beer, which is something I always look forward to when coming. My sister and my dad both ordered beers, but my sister's Porter arrived warm, despite being served in a cold glass. The waiter took it away and came back with beer that was slightly colder but still not ideal. My little sister and I both ordered BJ's deep dish pizza, which is always great thanks to a unique, if slightly polarizing crust and generous seasoned tomatoes. Dad ordered a deep dish lasagna, and while he thought it was good, he said that it was not better than grocery store lasagna. Not a ringing endorsement. My mom ordered salmon, which was pretty good. My sister ordered a bacon cheeseburger, but was dismayed by the lack of condiments both on the burger and the table, as well as the slightly soggy bread. Just before the meal, we had asked for water refills. However, our replacement waiter did not return with our drinks promptly. It wasn't until the middle of the meal when we got the water. At one point, we attempted to flag down another waiter, but to little avail. Of course, when visiting BJ's you just gotta order their famous Pizookies. They're Always a five-star dessert in my book, and they did help save the meal. However, the bill came in with an extra Porter and Pizookies, even though my sister supposedly got a free Pizookie and used a coupon for another one. These mistakes were corrected, but should not have been made. We also discovered a used napkin user the tables which was an unclean end to the visit.

This last time was just ridiculous. Waitress seemed very absent-minded and didn't have the greatest attitude. We ordered the 2 for $25 deal which comes with 2 salads, a pizza, and a pizookie. First, she forgot to ask what salads we wanted, and when she came back to ask, ten minutes later, she also had to double check what pizza we wanted.... meaning that whole time had passed without her putting in our order.... we had a group join us for drinks and immediately asked for separate checks which she said she couldn't do until the end because the system didn't let her.... what? There was only six of us...? Anyway, we finally got our pizza which didn't seem like too long of a wait. We drank for a few hours and the waitress was semi attentive but seemed to care more about talking to her friends. She was reallllllly laggy on getting our drinks towards the end. Then the best part, out of nowhere brings our check out. Ummm???? Who said we were done? We were waiting for another round? And when I asked her about our pizookie that comes with the dinner she says ""oh... yeah... what kind.."" in a super annoyed tone like she was seriously hoping I'd forget and just get out of her hair. Um yeah no.... I get Friday nights are hectic but if you can't slap a smile on your face for a few hours and provide halfway decent service, waitressing isn't the place for you.

I believe they are famous for their deep dish pizza, and my boyfriend raves about the bbq chicken pizza. I'm just not amazed. Their pizza seems like just a jazzed up version of the pizza you order. If you want real gourmet pizza, try Pizza Antica (it costs about the same).  What I do like is the ahi poke and tomato bisque soup. Service is also good.

Mimi J.,"Bakersfield, CA",774,1295,3576,3.0,9/4/2011,"If I were to review BJ's strictly on the avocado egg rolls, deep dish pizza, and Pizookie, it would rate 4 1/2 stars.   Unfortunately, this review is for their entire menu, and while I've never had anything here that tasted bad there just isn't anything special about the rest of the entrees that would deserve the 4th star. I have found the hostesses, waiters, and bartenders to be very enjoyable. They have smiled, joked with us, and generally had a good attitude and pleasant demeanor. No complaints here. The decor and atmosphere is that of an overgrown sports bar, but it is clean and well-lit so no complaints here, either. I have sampled the Jambalaya, the Lettuce Wraps,  and the Santa Fe Chicken Salad and there was absolutely nothing WRONG with them. They just did not measure up to the level I have come to expect from the pizza. They are standard bar fare and nothing more. But the pizza - oh the pizza. Deep dish crust - crispy on the outside but substantial and not overly starchy... served tableside right in the pan to keep it at the perfect temperature right up until you are ready to eat it.... Perfection. The sauce to crust ratio maintains the perfect balance and the toppings add to the experience rather than detract from it.   If this place were called ""BJ's Pizza"" I'd seriously be considering giving it that 4th and 5th star.  But - alas - it's not. The Avocado Egg Rolls have been consistently good (as I have been consistent in ordering them). The outside crust/wrapping is crisp and flaky and the insides creamy avocado-y goodness.  I could take or leave the dipping sauce. I'll dip about half of my egg rolls in them and eat half without. I think it is the combination of the creaminess of the centers and the flakiness of the crust that makes these things so good. They earn 5 STARS on their own. I am a big Pizooki fan. The Pizookie earn 4 stars as an after dinner dessert (I'm usually too full from the rest of the meal to truly enjoy them). If eaten by itself, it could rise to a 4 1/2 to a 5. So, in conclusion, for a 4-5 star experience, come to BJ's for the Avocado Egg Roll, Deep Dish Pizza, and Pizookie. You'll be so wrapped up in the food experience you won't even notice that most of the other customers are the overgrown Community College version of Frat Boys and Sorority Girls dressed to ""hook up"".

I call 20 minutes advance with that I was able to get my table as soon as I walk in so points to you BJ. Our waiter came and took drinks as well as our dishes, very limit menu and nothing amazing standing out. Once the waiter gave us our drink, she totally disappeared on us for the rest of the night. The worst part of this my friend was got a drink with no ice at all. Sitting there we waited for a the waiter to come back so we can have it fixed, but like I said disappeared just vanish. Lucky while another waiter came to refilled my drink, she was able to replace my friends drink as well. Situation was solved, and I was pleased until I notice how long our food was taking. Me thinking it was just a busy day because it seemed pack was fine with it until I notice 3 table to the left side of us came in after us and got there meal before us. There I stopped a waiter and explained our waiter vanish without giving us our food. More time pass by were the 3 tables all left and were placed with new people. Shortly after that it looked like a chef actually come out and gave us our food. My friends finishing all of her drink asked for another one with a rude manner, which I apologize for her actions for we were all hungry and frustrated. While the drink was getting replaced, I notice my burger I order adding pulled pork was missing the patty! The entire patty was gone! The chef came back out with a not so pleasant face, and I felt bad to ask for him to fix it right after my friend gave him attitude. Sucking it up and eating the burger I then notice that the pulled pork was dry and had no sauce, yet after sitting there for about 2 hours I was to hungry to even complain. I got the closest waiter to bring me my bill and payed and left a five dollar tip. Who ever got that tipped got to much for the awful experience. Those 4 waiters that help us each about once or twice can spilt it up for all I care.

I was told over the phone it would be a 1hr wait but when i showed up it got bumped up to a 2 hour wait. After about 30 mins there were a lot of free tables and still no buzz so we decided to sit ourselves. 15 mins later we get a waiter saying he'll sit us in a bigger table shortly. So we finally get seated and this is about 1 hour after we arrive. A hostess comes up to our table, doesn't say a word and starts handing each of us a menu. Finally she says ""your waitress will be with you shortly"" as she walks away...  We then meet our waitress who has permanent BITCH FACE. She takes our drink order and 1 dinner order. She disappears for about 30 mins. I even suggested to just skip out on our bill and leave because of the crappy service but we decided to stay. My friend decides to tell a waiter that she hasn't came back. That waiter comes back with our drinks. BITCH face finally decides to come back and take the rest of our dinner orders. 45 mins later we start to get our food. We all got our food except my friend who ordered her dinner WAY back when we ordered our first round of drinks. She tells the waitress that she didn't receive her food  and the waitress calls out the wrong order. My friend had to remind her of what she ordered. She doesn't admit to not punching in her order but we all knew she did. At this point we're pissed. She comes back with a super hot plate which mostly likely means it got either A. Microwaved or B. thrown in the oven to reheat it. The noodles where as good as a 25 cent pack of Ramon noodles. Completely tasteless. My friend had to ask a random waiter for a bottle of Tapatillo sauce because our ""waitress"" had gone on break. He doesn't come back w/tapatillo but he did have a chalula bottle. Everyone leaves more than half of their dinner because it was downright shitty. I didn't even want desert because the whole experience was just plain SHIT.

LJ M.,"Bakersfield, CA",322,172,439,4.0,11/5/2007,"Ellie G hits the nail on the head: ""half barflies and half family."" BJ's is loud and crowded with the groups of sports fans, young couples sporting formal attire, and large families eating without regard to price (which is up there).  The beer choices, cider, and wine list is amazing- I've never seen anything like it, even at Gordon Biersch in San Jose. When my husband and I went, the place was PACKED.  The front hostesses, although they happened to be long-lost friends, were relatively ditzy and took awhile to give us our ""little vibrating thingie"" (you know what I'm talking about, don't you?).  Once again, an old high school buddy took us to our table, which was a private, nice booth.  I admired the nine huge televisions blaring different channels in front of us, as well as two more to the side.  Behind us was a bigger room with families at tables, and in front of us, men and women milling about a bar. Our waitress was quick and exact.  She didn't have a very friendly demeanour, but I suppose that's because it was so jam-packed of customers that she couldn't spend time being personable.  I had a veggie burger with a wedge salad (no bacon, thanks).  It was definitely good, but I wished desparately for some good sourdough bread to sop the bleu cheese dressing up (yeah, I'm a bit European ""trash"" like that).  My husband had the grilled chicken tortellini (and damn it was good) with garlic bread (which was worse than Denny's garlic toast), with a glass of DELICIOUS limited-time pumpkin ale.  Oh my god, kids, this was the best beer I've ever tasted.  Clean, with an aftertaste of pumpkin spice...yum.  It wasn't sweet like I was expected, so that was a good thing, as well. The waitress was only excited and perky when she gave us the check, which was surprisingly only about five bucks more than what we pay when we go out to Denny's on weekdays.  So yeah, BJ's is a pretty good price for a couple going out on a weekend.  Especially for that awesome beer, and exciting atmosphere. Overall: I would say BJ's is the place to go for all-kinds, and it's a deliciously great way to spend a weekend night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bakersfield?start=320

They were perfectly filled with just the right amount of everything in them. I just wish they would come with more in one order for about ten dollars you only get 3 egg rolls, they are cut up in halves so it looks like more but it's not. I ordered the chicken fettuccine Alfredo. You have the choice of grilled chicken or blackened chicken. I chose to go for the blackened one.....bad idea. The chicken just tasted like it was seasoned with chili powder and paprika, it was not charred more as I was expecting. Overall it just didn't go with Alfredo and pasta, I recommend going with just the grilled chicken. We also ordered steak and a huge baked potato both were just as tasty, but that potato was reallllly good. And lastly we ordered a small Mediterranean pizza, super loaded with a bunch of toppings I may not know the names of but it was good.

So when we do receive our appetizer we got what it seemed to be the crumbs at the bottom of the bag of chips!! Okay so let's go on to our actual meals. My California burger, wasn't cooked all the way. I had asked for the chipotle mayonnaise on the side & they didn't bring it out.

Bryan D.,"Bakersfield, CA",48,128,209,2.0,10/3/2011,"The trendy atmosphere here makes me want to puke.  The beer is okay.  The food is very inconsistent.  The service is consistently horrible.  Seriously, I have been here 5-10 times and never had good service.  One time I went and got the fish tacos.  I thought they were pretty good so then next time I went, I ordered them again.  The second time they were horrible!  What the??  Same thing happened with the pizza.  So I decided that going to BJ's is a gamble that I will probably avoid. I have to share the worst and most unbelieveable story from BJ's.  This was the last time I was there.  I was eating dinner there with the family.  I had to take the kids to the bathroom.  When we walk in the bathroom, my kids almost step on a turd that is on the floor.  I'm not kidding, there was a freakin adult sized turd, sitting in the middle of the bathroom floor, not even in a stall!  It was obviously a prank by an immature kid or adult.  To say it was disgusting was an understatement.  We exited the bathroom and went back to out table.  I quickly flagged down an employee and told her what we just saw.  She looked as if she was holding back a smirk and said it would be taken care of.  Okay, in a way, I understand her reaction.  The most unbelieveable thing was that we sat there for another 8 minutes or so before leaving, watching the restroom door, and no employee went into the bathroom!  The whole time we saw several customers go in and out.  Sounds unbelieveable, but it was true.  GROSS!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bakersfield?start=320

All in all the food for the most part was decent. The problem was with the customer service. First, the waitress took about 10 minutes to serve lemonades and a water. The appetizer came a little later and the steaks took about 30 minutes. When we asked for ranch, the waitress served us a teaspoon of ranch and said that is the last ranch in the entire restaurant. This was the main problem because we eat ranch with the potato wedges and mashed potatoes. After asking to speak to the manager, we were told that there's tons of ranch in the back. He approached us like we were nothing, asking ""hey what's the problem guys?""  This is not good customer service and I don't know how a waitress doesn't know where the ranch is.

Jacob V.,"Santa Clarita, CA",160,47,28,4.0,1/26/2009,"A friend of mine is a Sheriff in Bakersfield who was injured in the line of duty in December 2009, so I do what I can to come up and visit him while he's on his time off. For some reason whenever I travel to Bakersfield, I feel the need to drink. It might be something in the air, or I might be an alcoholic. I haven't quite decided yet... So we decided to go to BJ's, as it was very close to his house, and we needed some beers and a solid meal. I had eaten at this BJ's the week before, and have eaten at the BJ's near my house, so I knew it was a safe bet. There were 3 of us that strolled in, and immediately sat ourselves down at a table near the bar. We were quickly greeted by our server and ordered our drinks. I prefer the ""Blonde"" beer, which was so delicious I eventually ordered 2 more. As for the server, he was excellent with his timing, and as my beer got critically low, he brought me a replacement. Impeccable timing. As for the food, I was borderline starving, so I ordered a small Blackened Chicken Pizza (an off-menu item FYI), which arrived shortly after my first beer was replaced. The temperature was perfect, and it was quite tasty. I inhaled the entire pizza, and almost started licking the pan it came in, but realized I was in public and that would look a little weird. But the pizza was definitely worth mentioning. Bottom Line: This trip to BJ's was one of the best I've had at any BJ's, the food was pan-licking-good, the beers were tasty, and the service was excellent. So why 4 stars Jacob? I'm glad you asked... I had come to this BJ's a week ago and ordered the Calzone... I am used to calzones filling my plate. The calzone I received was the size of a hot pocket. No joke. I am the kind of guy, where if I'm hungry, I'll scarf down an entire pizza and lick the pan when I'm done. However, when I spend $9 on a calzone, I expect more than a hot pocket.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bakersfield?start=320

D R.,"Lake Forest, CA",120,17,,5.0,5/1/2009,"This place is SO good that I wouldn't care even if I had bad service (as many of you have had). I  mean, come on, you're saying a deep dish, Chicago style pizza and pizookie can't soothe your wounds? Maybe I'm much too easily won over.  But, in any event, I grew up with parents who once lived in Chicago and they could never stop telling my bro and I how amazing pizza there was. So when I finally got the chance to take them to BJs, I was quite pleased with myself. They actually really liked it, but WORD OF ADVICE, if you have impatient friends/family members, dont go on Fri or Sat night. Try an early dinner or lunch instead. Also, DONT DO TAKEOUT. The pizza just doesn't taste as good cold or reheated. It gets soggy and loses the yumminess that comes with the crisp, deep crust. Also, be prepared to only eat 2 slices, max--remember, deep-dish=filling! My favorites/recommendations 1. BJs Favorite 2. Vegetarian 3. Great White Also, I'm not a beer fan so I always get a crisp, refreshing Pear Cider. YUM. Lastly, don't even think about ending your meal without a pizookie!

Nikki M.,"Bakersfield, CA",51,297,278,1.0,5/22/2013,"Came here on Sunday for my grandfather's birthday. We got here around 11am so it wasn't very busy at all. At first the waitress seemed on the ball, but that quickly faded. We had to ask for all of our refills. My brother ordered a pan pizza and they brought out one that clearly was not pan crust. He asked about it and inquired as to whether or not they simply changed their recipe. He was told that the oven wasn't working so they didn't have pan pizzas. Clearly this is something he should have been told when he ordered. He kept the pizza since he was hungry. After biting into it he realized there was no pizza sauce. Seriously, no sauce on a pizza??? I had the creole tilapia. The fish and rice were good. My only complaint was that my salad had no dressing. The menu said it had a vinegarette and the waitress also mentioned this, yet there was none. Overall it was a bad experience. Honestly I can't think of a good experience I've really had here.

As soon as we sat down, the waiter came by and told us that the table will be cleaned. The table was cleaned couple mins after. The waiter came by again and asked us what we wanted to drinkFor happy hour, their craft beer is 5.25 for regular price, but for happy hour is 4.00. The pitcher price was 15.00. I ended up getting 2 pitchers and few appetizers. Some of the appetizers we got were California Club Flatbread pizza, Thai Shrimp lettuce wraps, and Avocado Egg roll. The California Club flatbread pizza was ok, it was not that great.  Not to much flavor and the taste was kind of bland. The Thai Shrimp lettuce wraps was actually delicious.  It had cajun style shrimp and it was kind of spicy.  The lettuce makes it even more great with the sauce on top.  The Avocado Egg roll was not bad at all too.  The avocado and egg together wrapped made it great.  The sauce that compliments the avocado egg roll is the best.

Quite simply, we've never had a less than stellar meal here. My complaint lies with the service for this review. Most of the time, it's great and we usually have just one server. This last week it was downright confusing. Our server took our order and we never saw or heard from her again. Didn't tell us she was heading to a break (possibly lunch?), just disappeared. A runner delivered our food and  after awhile, I think the busboy, or maybe even dishwasher, took over. He refilled our drinks, pulled our empty dishes, asked if we wanted dessert, and printed our check. I asked if he would be getting the tip since he took over for our server, and was sad to learn that he would not. I'm always a very generous tipper, but I had to draw the line here.

Glad that was an option, (because after being served a muddy salad last visit I was reluctant to even return) but then They served the potato and though it was enough to fill the gullet it's presentation was strange to me.

I spoke with our Waitress, she didn't know why I spoke to the server who was Rude and brought just one persons meal and said I don't know where the rest of your order is and promptly walked off. I ask to speak to the Manager who said I will promptly see that you get your meals. We were brought the meals which had been sitting in the Kitchen for 30 minutes. I again asked to speak to the Manager she assured me we would be getting Freshly cooked meals if we would wait and she would cover the cost of the meals. We waited for 15 more minutes No Food ! BJ's truly has lost its ability to care if one group of Four people are served as long as 50% maybe 60% are served.

Ellie S.,"Bakersfield, CA",234,71,9,4.0,8/5/2007,"What a glorious town Bakersfield is. Just when I think there is nowhere to go for good entertainment, I stumble upon this little jewel. Apparently the Bakersfield club scene has taken to beginning their long night of partying at BJ's. Now this may seem a little troubling. You may ask yourself, ""Hey, but isn't BJ's a pretty well known chain that serves moderately priced American food to huge families?"" Indeed, BJ's reserves this demographic but in Bakersfield, BJ's also lends itself to haggard 30-somethings looking for happiness in the next meaningless hook-up. In fact, the restaurant is perfectly split in half: Half for the families, half for the bar-flies. This is especially convenient for me as I have found it to be much like dinner theatre. My booth on the family side is set up perfectly for people-watching. In the last episode of  Days of Our BJ's, a new character was introduced. A quite desperate-looking female waltzed in with that air of ""look at me please before my tits sag and I lose this waist"" which, to be honest, wouldn't have been that different but she was. She had a little extra flair in the form of a pageant sash and a tiara. I wish I could tell you what the sash said but all I could catch was ""Miss Outta..."" I guess I will have to fill in the blank with the art of using context clues. Perhaps it was ""Miss Outta of Her Twenties"" or ""Miss Outta Wedlock"". But enough with my catty-ness. She isn't what struck me as especially entertaining that night. In fact, it was the second woman in pageant regalia that struck me as weird, as it seemed that they did not come together. Does this mean that two separate women came up with the idea to wear sashes to dinner that night? I hope so. I also spent most of the night hoping some sort of fight would start between them. Dueling tiaras, if you will. I was severely let down. Oh and the pizookie is amazing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bakersfield?start=340

I remember when this place was built, I had just moved away from Fakersfield, and everyone was soooo hyped on it. Call me crazy, but I just don't get that excited over restaurants that I can eat at 74 different locations. But, in the spirit of being out of town and hanging out with my brother and his girl, I decided to be a good sport. Right when we were seated, I ordered a Berry Burst Cider... SO GOOD! Its like Wyder's cider, but more bubbly and tart. My brother and Manfriend ordered a pitcher of the BJ's hef, and that was pretty good as well. This is where (most of) the goodness ends.  Our server... sigh. She was terrible. Besides being awful, she had a shitty attitude. Honestly, if you're not the most skilled server and you forget things and spill stuff, I'm really not going to care if you have a smile on your face. But once you start throwin your crappy attitude at me, my compassion halts.  Their menu is pretty big, and I start getting overwhelmed when I have too many choices, food-wise. So when this happens, I usually just order whatever was the first thing to catch my eye. Can't go wrong with gut instinct, right? Wrong. I ordered the ""New"" Italian Market salad, which was described as ""A new twist to the original italian chopped salad. Fresh Mozzarella, chunks of Fontina cheese and salami, artichokes, Kalamata olives, roasted red peppers, peperoncinis, garbanzo beans, red onions, cucumbers, tomatoes, romaine and iceberg lettuce all topped with fresh parmesan and basil then tossed with Italian herb vinaigrette."" Sounds delish, right? It was a total disappointment. I ordered sans cucumbers, but I'm thinking she may think I said, ""with no cucumbers, olives, basil, red peppers, or parmesan."" And another thing, my salad was about 1/2 the size of Manfriend's chopped BBQ chicken salad. WTF.  His salad was pretty good, standard BBQ chicken salad. Manfriend ordered the onion straw thingys on the side for me... and we also ordered a bowl of broccoli cheese soup... which she forgot to even put in, so we ended up unknowingly eating my brother's girlfriend's cup of soup she ordered with her sandwich. The soup was good, but barely even warm. Brother ordered the roast beef dip, which he wasn't super pleased with. We didn't send anything back, because judging by how slow our server was, it would have turned into a 3 hour excursion.  So heres the lesson- Stick with pizza at BJ's, and don't set the bar too high for service. You'll be disappointed. Next time, I will get my Basque food, damn it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bakersfield?start=340
Megan H.,"Baltimore, MD",10,53,74,2.0,2/25/2007,"Bland, boring American food in big portions- and not particularly cheap- it's just not my thing. I can forgive bad service at a cheap hole-in-the-wall joint, but there's no excuse at a resto like this with real prices. There were problems with all the special requests, but the worst is that they almost overcharged us by $60! A couple left early and paid their portion of the bill. When I asked why their items were still listed on the bill the rest of us got, the waitstaff said although the items still appeared on the bill, they weren't calculated into the total. We asked her to recalculate the bill just in case, and of course she was incorrect. She mumbled an apology, but didn't offer anything else. Lame.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bakersfield?start=340
Theresa L.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,6,7,1.0,1/24/2013,"I've been to several other BJ's in CA and I really enjoy their food. However, the Bakersfield location has the worst customer service. I myself have horror stories and have heard some from many others as well. I will not go back anymore. I've drawn the line. I'll just have to wait to go out of town to have that great deep dish again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bakersfield?start=340
Debbie C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",188,769,294,4.0,12/4/2007,It was my first time going to a BJ's and oh my goodness BJ's Famous Pizookie is one crazy dessert!!!! We got half chocolate chip cookie and half white chocolate chip cookie. I really liked this place. A bunch of coworkers and I sat at the bar and got some good bar food and beer.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bakersfield?start=340
Unscrewed P.,"Bakersfield, CA",1,2,,2.0,1/2/2013,"First impression: Revolving door needs to be oiled. The place is dim, but clear and just loud enough to not be be able to hear the person your with. Service is poor at best, takes forever and servers could care less if your order is taken correctly or if your drink is filled. My associate ordered the veggie burger only to be informed that they are no longer serving it. After what had to have been 30 minutes we were served  mozzarella sticks which were essentially lightly breaded sticks of string cheese. They were OK. Ended up ordering a Hand tossed pizza which was undercooked (cheese not melted all the way) and missing one of the toppings. My associate ordered the calzone which seemed decent enough although it contained canned pineapples. Overall the food was edible but staff and service needs improvement. Bill came to $33.31",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bakersfield?start=340
Amber B.,"Bakersfield, CA",18,93,3,4.0,1/15/2012,"So my husband and I have been here twice now.  So far we like it!  The food has been consistant both times.  The atmosphere is great.  It has a pretty big bar area. You can dress up a bit if you really wanted or show up in a hoodie and still fit in.  We went about 5pm and had to wait about 15 minutes for a table.  soon after we were seated, the place filled up fast.  Service was pretty good on our first trip.  The waitress gave us some recommendations, which my father in law followed, and he wasn't dissapointed.  He ordered the fish and chips.  I ordered the fish tacos.  I thought that they were awesome! They came with guac and salsa (which were good) and maybe 5 chips.  I do wish that they came with more chips. My husband ordered the crispy jalapeno burger.  It was huge!  He loved it. It had deep fired jalapenos on it which he said added a wonderful touch.  We all ordered their beers and we were all happy with them.  I ordered the brunette, which so far is my fave ( I do like darker beers the most).  My husbands fave is the pale ale.  The second trip , I ordered the angel hair pasta. It was very yummy.  The serving size was huge.  pasta was cooked perfectly.  The flavors were very subtle.  My husband ordered the cajun pasta with shrimp.  he really liked it, but thought it could be spicier.  he thought the burger was better. service wasn't as great this trip.  We sat at the table for a few minutes and then another family was seated later.  The waitress saw them first even though we had already been waiting.  It was apparent that she forgot about us a few times.  She would wait on her other tables, walk away, then literally do an about face and come to our table, like ""Oh yeah I forgot about these two"".  We waited for awhie to get our check and then awhile longer for her to come back for the credit card.   My only reason for not giving them a 5 star is because on the first trip i asked for my tacos without onions, and they still put the onions on, and the second trip I ordered chicken in my pasta and they forgot to put it in, so I had to wait for it.  The food was good though, regardless.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bakersfield?start=340
Kay S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",17,58,4,1.0,2/26/2010,Let me just start by saying that I've been to several other BJ's locations but this one? This ones makes me so ANGRY. I love the food at BJ's and I especially love the beer. But the service here is so absolutely horrible that I can't even enjoy eating here. That's really sad and I wish they'd do something about it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bakersfield?start=340
Adrian C.,"Visalia, CA",8,4,,2.0,6/26/2012,"Food was good... But our waitress was lazy, had to keep asking for refills. Then she just dropped the bill on our table as if we were at a Denny's, and we were still eating. Our waitress name was Cynthia.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bakersfield?start=340
