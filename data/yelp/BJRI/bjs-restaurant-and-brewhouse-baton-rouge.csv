Razaa A.,"New Orleans, LA",7,65,43,1.0,8/6/2017,"Horrific service. Waiter's name was Nicholas. Ordered a pizza with no meat, they brought out PORK. Manager hand delivered the new one to my table and didn't even apologize. They didn't comp the pizza on the bill, and they also subbed in shrimp on the pizza for the pepperoni and sausage, AND still up-charged!

Keith W.,"Lanesville, IN",0,1,,4.0,8/12/2017,"I was amazed at the gourmet designed options, delivery, display, and quite frankly the delectable taste of the food I received at prices of big chain ""Bar Food"" vendors.   Just reading the menu makes you feel like you're on an episode of MasterChef.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-baton-rouge?start=20
Quay L.,"Hallsville, TX",5,12,27,5.0,12/21/2016,My experience was delightful. Learned about the different portions. You can get lunch portions for dinner for lower calories.

Quynh D.,"New Orleans, LA",228,151,322,4.0,6/24/2015,"Yay! Good bar food. Back in the day, chili's was the only restaurant I knew growing up. Then I was exposed to the world of delicious, natural, inventive good food throughout the southern Louisiana I-10 line. Naturally, chili's became my worst nightmare. However, sometimes you crave that original place that has Americas favorites. (hamburgers, sandwiches, pizza and beer) Bj's has slowly become my go to spot for whenever I need to satisfy the appetites of a variety of people. You can't please everyone at an oyster bar or a sushi joint, but you can at Bj's. The only reason why I'm giving four stars instead of five is because the service isn't the greatest.  The sample appetizer plate comes with mozzarella sticks, spinach and artichoke dip, avocado rolls, and Sante de rolls. Sub avocado for more Sante Fe egg rolls.  Lightly fried Mahi Mahi tacos delicious. Chicken dish also delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-baton-rouge?start=20
Andrew A.,"Columbus, OH",105,7,1,2.0,12/26/2016,"The reviews for BJ's Brewhouse all seem to share a common there: Hit or Miss Quality. Tonight was our third visit to this location.  Our first two visits (a slow summer afternoon and a recent Friday night) we're fine; good service and decent food at a price we expected. Tonight was different.  Tonight was a miss. We arrived at 6:30 ton full restaurant.  The hostess took our phone number and told us the wait was 10-15 minutes.  We had hoped to grab a few happy hour drinks anyway, so we checked the bar area for a bar table/space.  There were 4 ""open"" tables that were piled with dirty dishes.  We decided to wait for one of those and took our seat when the first one was cleaned 20 MINUTES LATER (6:50 - still happy hour).  Someone came to take our drink 15 later and our drinks came 15 minutes after that.  If you're following along at home, you'll notice that we had been at the brewhouse for 50 minutes before w received our first drink.   The server took our food order when our drinks arrived.  We did not see him again until the food came out.  The food (a pizza and a dinner salad) was fine.  We ordered a second round of drinks upon the arrival of the food and those did not come until we had almost finished eating.   And then the wait for the check...    zzz...   zzz...   zzz... Check arrived.  Happy Hour discount for one of the first drinks ($1.50 off a beer - thank you) but did not do it for the other drink (1/2 off wine - WTF?).  We left feeling ripped off. It was a cruddy enough experience that we won't be back. PRO TIP:  If you intend to drink while at BJ's Brewhouse, bring a flask and few bottles of water from home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-baton-rouge?start=20

Rebecca W.,"Baton Rouge, LA",1970,931,7784,5.0,9/21/2016,"I have been here a bunch of times that I can't believe I've never written a review for this place! Honestly, I can't ever say I've ever had a bad experience here. Some may think I am being overly generous with my stars and I say, ""why not""? It's consistent every time. I have come here with me and my small family and have been here with a large party as well. Servers have always been courteous, food has always come the way I requested for it to be prepared and there have been plenty of times that they have gone over and above my expectations. So, I am a foodie and always love receiving food that looks similar to the photo or sometimes better than the photo. Their pizzas here are pretty fabulous. I enjoy thin, crispy crust pizzas and enjoy Chicago-style deep dish pizza with that bubbly, cheesy crust. BJ's has that deep dish, bubbly, cheesy style crust that I can't get enough of. Don't come here just to get a salad (even though they are pretty good), come here to get a large, deep dish pizza and have at it! Don't come here if you're on a diet, go somewhere else for that. I am pretty crazy about the pizza here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-baton-rouge?start=20
Matthew D.,"Baton Rouge, LA",0,1,,1.0,4/5/2017,HORRIBLE customer service. Food came out 15 minutes before we got silverware. We had to ask for a refill during our 1.5 hour dine in at the restaurant.

Evelyn F.,"Raleigh, NC",141,8,4,5.0,8/31/2016,After being stuck in traffic my children and I decided to get off the next exit. We stumbled upon this gem of a place. A wonderful children's menu and wonderful adult menu and a full bar. They make their own wonderful craft brews. My kids ate everything on their plates.. And some of mine too LOL. It's my new favorite place in Baton Rouge.  The whole experience was nice. The hostess was friendly and welcoming as if we were guests at her home. We had a sweet server named Ty who made sure we were aware of all the specials and gave good recommendations on food choices.  Whether you are a health nut or want some yummy barfood. This is the place to go. Be sure to check out their happy hour specials both on food and drinks.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-baton-rouge?start=20
Swatee G.,"Fairfax, VA",515,637,1157,3.0,12/30/2014,"I have only ended up coming here late at night multiple times with people from work in parties of 4 or more. Service can be spotty depending on the traffic in this place. Also, do not expect to get any choice seating unless you are willing to wait  awhile - and that annoys me, because the place NEVER looks like it is more than half full. Now as far as food goes, I think the place does a decent job. I have tried various things here and a few stand out. I had this watermelon salad which was very tasty actually! I have also tried their blackened fish entree which was pretty decent. The tomato mozzarella flatbread was also great. Can't say all their food is great though. Some folks on our table did not enjoy all their food. All in all, I think it's an ok place to come to, just be prepared for a long wait and spotty service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-baton-rouge?start=20

Bobby G.,"Baton Rouge, LA",279,78,71,2.0,11/8/2015,Not the best food but definitely not the worst. It's kinda a hit and miss kinda thing..

Chantel V.,"Baton Rouge, LA",314,114,344,4.0,9/11/2014,"I received OUTSTANDING service. I have to say that first. However.....I may have just had the worst bj's pizza I've ever had in my life. I have been an avid fan of their deep dish pizza for over TEN YEARS. My pizza today looked like all the cheese had oozed out from the center of the crust and slid down the sides. It tasted awful. My side Caesar salad was DRENCHED in dressing. Granted im accustomed to bjs in California,  but still. I expect much more from this restaurant. So.....***Review Update*** I frequent this place. Usually to catch a game, or for a late night outing. Service has REMAINED STELLAR and dare I say it, food has also improved. In fact, they have a salad that I have absolutely fallen in love with.

Our sampler appetizer was wrong, but we didn't say anything. Then our so called BBQ chicken salad with NO CHICKEN in it ...& nasty BBQ mixed with more nasty dressing. Then the waitress going to tell us ""ohh, that ain't my fault, that's the kitchen"". The young manager came & brought the small plate of chopped up chicken & said he'll discount something on the salad. And at this point, my husband blood is boiling already. And when he got the bill, nothing was changed on it.

Han K.,"Houston, TX",85,31,63,4.0,7/28/2016,"Came in for dinner on a Thursday night and was seated promptly for 2 at a 4 top table by the host. The service started with a confused waitress not knowing if we were greeted already or not so that was a bit embarrassing. After 3 minutes our waitress arrives to get our drink orders but she was not aware of the beer sampler details which made me opt out of it. I ended up getting a pint of Stella and Alabama sunset. The new Alabama sunset was a great cocktail with a nice pineapple orange juice flavor and a slight hint of alcohol present.  The calamari- very delicious! Lightly breaded with jalapeños fried bits which was very complimentary.  Jalapeño burger- delicious tasting burger with a bit of spice. Could have used a tad bit more salt and some kind of a sauce to the burger but still delicious on that amazing bun. The skinny fried complimented it amazingly.  The ahi tuna salad- amazing salad with a nice blend of flavored with the daikon, salad, fish, and sauce. A great choice for a nice and healthy entree.  However during our dining we were interrupted several times with confused servers bringing another tables food to our table. They might need to step up their memorization on their table charts a bit better.  Our server Elizabeth tonight did a great job tonight. We could clearly tell she was new to being a server but she made no mistakes and did a wonderful job.  Overall I gave this place 4 stars tonight due to the lack of communication with the employees at bjs tonight.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-baton-rouge?start=20

She reminded us to download the app get free mini pizookie!! She also split our check perfectly without us asking.  Food; I loved my BJ's favorite pizza I can still smell and taste it after hours LOL. It's so delicious and my first time trying deep dish pie pizza. The sausage and pepperoni  green pepper and white onion was a pretty dope blend and it was crispy but soft at the same time!! I'm lactose but yolo. I got the mini which was 4 slice (plenty for me) I was full after 2.5 :) I ordered the grilled cheese to go with fries for my cousin! Emily ordered the pasta dish also deep dish in cheese and it was pretty tasty!!! The mini pizookie was insane I def liked the chocolate chip one WAY more. Would have gotten the avo egg rolls if that wasn't like 1k calories... Cost: this was crazy my total was 14.50$ for pizza, pizookie (free cus of the app), and grilled cheese w/ fries. Apparently my pizza was half off from 12$ to 6 cus it was happy hour. We went around 2:30pm:)! I LOVED this meal and would totally come back.

Ping K.,"Lake Oswego, OR",125,64,274,5.0,1/12/2018,"I didn't think I was going to be happy with a restaurant franchise but the young dude who referred me this place sweared by it. The decor is cool with bling bling mirrors, photographs, chandeliers and very good selection of beers. I was impressed. So I ordered their famous New Orleans Jambalaya and paired with red ale. The food came out fast and boy, the shrimps and chicken were very fresh.  A huge portion too!! Not as spicy as the waiter claimed to be though. O, well I am at 4 to 5 star spicy level, this dish is probably hot enough for many but only 1 star in my opinion. Still very good.  The server Taylor was super nice. They also have a nice bar area.

I never have been fond of the food, but I feel like a lot has changed in a good way from quicker service to food.  We ordered the dark beer flight, but that just reinforced how much I hate the taste of beer so that was a no go for me. I also ordered pumpkin ale beer and didn't like that too much either and our waitress kindly changed the drink for me to a strawberry splash, which was very delicious! I got my braces tightened that day and the macaroni and cheese and clam chowder was perfect for me to eat! My boyfriend got the weekend special prime rib and it came with 3 sides and a pazooki for $26! The service was quick and the waitress was friendly.

Our appetizer arrived which was good and our meal came and it was terrific but no mixed drink. The server became MIA. We got no refills on the drink and requested condiments never arrived. After we finished she came back and I told her I was not happy cause my drink never came, she was speechless and told her I never got condiments or refills she gave me a blank look and said nada.her service I thought was going to be 100% but it was 30% wow.

Nikki F.,"Addis, LA",8,59,281,4.0,11/25/2017,"I like going here for the atmosphere and nice decor! My little one loves the pizookies! My two favorite dishes are the root beer glazed ribs and the root beer glazed wings. Both items are listed under appetizers but I order them as a entree and add a house salad. On our last visit my husband decided to get the double bone pork chop and a bake potato. This pork chop is very thick! He said the seasoning was phenomenal. He also enjoyed the bake potato. My little ones had the personal pan pizza and it was delicious as well. It's similar to Pizza Hut but better. On this visit our waitress, Natasha was super nice!! We had three little girls with us and she made them feel very special. I don't know if it was a Black Friday special or not but she brought out a complimentary appetizer to the kids. It was a garlic buttered croissant and a small cup of grapes and blackberries. When it came time for the desserts she delivered the pizookies with a candle so the girls could make a wish and blow them out. Natasha displayed excellent customer service.

Our frustrated waiter apologized and went back to get them. We ordered a cocktail from the bar..... it took about 30 minutes to get it. The waiter kept going back asking for it and the bartender kept shoeing him away, and telling him we would have to wait ( we witnessed this from our table). The manager was called to the table, he was very apologetic and offered to comp the meal, but we declined and only accepted a comp for the drink. Our food was ok, nothing to be wowed by.

They have a good variety of beers so you will surely find something you enjoy Cons: service is slow during happy hour. The wait staff is nice, but it does take a while to get your food.

All together it was about $30. A dinner for 4 for under $40 is ok in my book. My caprese was very delicious at about 900 calories including the fries. The meat lovers calorie count was 1160.

I expect way better service and quality for the price.   Unlikely we'll return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-baton-rouge
Katie S.,"Baton Rouge, LA",0,12,1,4.0,1/14/2017,"BJs is a nice place to go for a place to meet with friends to sit back, share some appetizers, and watch a sporting event. At least to me, not too many crazy sports fan screaming, a relaxed way to enjoy. The menu is large, and anyone can find anything on it. I used to love to get the fried artichokes in lemon aioli. It was a small bites dish, so wish there was more. I sometimes shared their chili nachos with others, decent version. I'd prefer typical nacho ingredients to go on it, not just chili like we had. Going there many times though I've had many different types of service. Some amazing and some lack luster. I understand that comes with going to any restaurant though. I gave BJs a 4 out of 5 though because everything I had was good, but not necessarily something I feel the need to get again and again.

Surprisingly the sides were better than the entrees! Fries were crisp and delicious. Clam chowder was flavorful and hot.

Well, when our waiter gave our meals to us the grilled chicken was missing. I waited for a minute or two to find our waiter because he's nowhere to be found. Then he gave us the chicken.

And the review isn't going to help them change or make the restaurant better.  Anyway- down to business.... I visited this BJ's multiple times- lunch, dinner, late night drinks. Each time was different. I've previously had a terrible experience at a BJ's in another state, so my expectations were pretty low to begin.  First time, was awesome! The waiter was knowledgeable about the menu, clear with the specials, and even recommended a few dishes. My fiance even asked to speak with the manager to tell him how great the server did!! (it takes alot to impress the fiance with the food industry!) So we returned... This time for dinner and late night drinks.. This time was mediocre. The waitress wasnt ANYTHING like the first waiter we had. She was pushy- wanted us to get food, but we wanted to sit and drink a little. She had her friends come in at the bar, and it was a large party. She wanted to take care of them which is understandable, but remember.. there are still other tables!! She completely forgot about us when her friends walked in. The table to loud, obnoxious, crowded! So we had to track her down once we were ready to order food.  After we had eaten, my fiance got SICK later that night!! He ordered some chicken dish with mashed potatoes and ate some of my pasta also!!!!  Third time, a friend invited us out and with the last experiences we thought maybe we'll get another good one. Well the waitstaff was again struggling to keep up with his tables. He didnt check up on us often and we normally had to yell at him from across the room so we can ask him questions. The fiance's burger was BURNT TO A CRISP!!! WORST Burger ever!!!!!!! It was like a crispy patty that sat too long under the heat lamps. I think I got a chicken dish and I wasnt all that impressed with it.   With this BJ's its hit or miss.... My expectations are still low.

The food - basic but solid pub fare.  Good burgers, decent fish & chips - nothing fancy but it all does go quite well with the beer!

We have a hard time goin out to eat especially at corporate chains because we both have been in the food biz for 20+yrs. we chose BJs today because they have the gluten free crusts and in the past at other locations I was able to order a burger and they use the crust for a bun. Which for anyone GF u know it's just not the same to always have to eat a burger on a lettuce bun .. So that was always a plus but here at this location they first told us No, so I settled for a pizza, when our pizza hit the table they looked like hell.. Center loaded and my topping wasn't correct . And our draft root beers were nasty and flat..so we were very unhappy. The floor mgr Steve came and talked to us and we could tell he really cared. He went to the kitchen to make sure our order came out. They made the burger for me and hooked it up and he even sent us some soups to tide us over while we waited.

Michael F.,"Baton Rouge, LA",1,46,,4.0,11/1/2014,"We had written this place off after our last visit.  Came back to give it a try, glad we did.  We were greeted by a friendly smile, seated promptly, and they were kind towards our child, unlike last visit.  Our waitress was very swift, getting our ordered and the food came out in a timely fashion.  I really enjoyed the pepperoni pizza dip!  You can always find the run of the mill spinach and artichoke dip for an appetizer, this was different and delicious.  My 2 year old agreed! . I also ordered a black and blue house burger.  It was cooked properly, seasoned well, and the toppings complimented the burger.  I loved the thin cut fries.  I always go for thin fries but these are really thin, crispy, and seasoned well.  My wife had a tomato bisque bread bowl and really enjoyed it.  Our child did also.  He ate some of everything!  Overall, I think they redeemed themselves from our last visit and I will try this again just to have the pizza dip and try a different entree.  Oh, I almost forgot my wife's favorite part, the peanut butter s'mores dessert.  She and my son shared it, I don't eat desserts often, but she coaxed me into trying it and I had to confiscate the dish!

Lisa J.,"Seattle, WA",29,214,32,1.0,5/9/2012,"I am so, so done with you, BJ's.  My last review praised you for decent food, but every time I have gone back since (both with groups and to pick up to-go orders) I've had a bad experience.  The hosts and hostesses are all surly and rude, and if you bring in a party that requires a few tables to be put together, they will piss and moan and make you stand around for half an hour.  I'm fine waiting for a bit when coming in with a group of 8, especially if the restaurant is bustling and full, but when four out of eight of us come in at 6:30 on a Tuesday and less than 25% of your tables are filled?  Don't make us stand there for half an hour and insist that we have at least five people arrive before you seat us.  We would have happily sat down and started filling your coffers by ordering drinks and appetizers, but clearly you didn't want the extra $80 on our tab. If you absolutely have to have BJ's because you're craving their pot roast, do yourself a favor and order it to go.  If you're very very lucky someone will actually be tending the curbside phones, and you'll only have to walk in to get your food about half the time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-baton-rouge?start=80

While waiting I noticed this place looked like every TGIFridays/Chili's/Applebees....except they make their own beer.   When we were finally seated, it took another 20 for out waiter to take our drink order.    Ithen had to flag him down to take out food order.  He was friendly but more interested in the young ladies at the tables next to me and 2 kids.  That I don't blame him for but the numb nuts should know men in their 30's tip better than college age girls.   We finally get our food and low and behold the appetizer and entrees all come out at the same time.  I asked the waiter what's the point in ordering an appetizer if you are just going to bring everything at the same time.  He looked confused.  Anyway the nachos were cold, the cheese was a big clump,  the rest of the food was ok at best. The service here sucks. When i say it sucks, I promise it sucks as I am pretty laid back when it comes to this stuff.  They are very unorganized.  No silverwear when the food came out, then they didn't have enough clean to give us.  I shared my daughters fork.

My Parmesan crusted chicken was to die for but was served with rotted broccoli--how hard is it to LOOK at the veggies before you throw them in the steamer? Sad kitchen fail on that one, your prep cook needs to step up his game and either make sure the veggies are fresh every day and throw away the rotting ones. The chicken was another story though.  It was crispy on the outsite and the lemon sauce with the sundried tomato bits and fresh basil were a great counter point but it needed a bit of salt which was so WET in the shaker I couldn't get it out.  Here's a tip: put about a quarter of a teaspoon of raw rice in your salt shakers to keep it dry and flowing freely--how can you NOT know this??  My dining companions seemed pleased with their choices, a Tomato cream soup that looked very good, the fish tacos which were also good according to my other friend.

A few minutes later he sat 2 young ladies.  I expected the server to stop by soon so I decided what i wanted to drink and eat.  I searched for hotels in Shreveport LA and booked a room; and then I noticed the two ladies had drinks and no menus.  I asked if they ordered and they said yes. I checked... 15 -17 minutes had flown by and not one of the three servers who walked by offered me a glass of water, let alone acknowledge I was there.  So I asked for the manager. Gary, a nice enough guy but, I was so angry I didn't need him to appease me.  I left fully engulfed in anger and frustration.  Then I heard some one call, I took a deep breath, and I turned.   Thank you Roger (executive chef) for taking the extra minute to calm me down and remind me that I just needed to eat- and have a beer.

The only time I do it is if it is extremely good or extremely bad.  Unfortunately this post is regarding the latter. I ordered a Signature Deep Dish Pizza and what I got was a cheap imitation of a deep dish pizza that had no sauce. Well let me rephrase, I think they substitute grease for pizza sauce.  On top of that, the pizza was not true deep dish...It was only about be an inch thick and the crust was way to airy to be true deep dish...Please do not be fooled by the delicious looking pictures of real deep dish pizza on their website. You will not receive that if you order. I don't mind paying for good food, but please heed my warnings, before you order this, take your 25 dollars, crumple it up and throw it in the toilet. Then take another 25 dollars find you're other favorite pizza joint and order.  You will get the same experience (i.e. throwing away good money) without the inconvenience of going to the s*$t hole.

The lines in the food court were insane, clearly understaffed and then I saw a little blue arrow in the mall that said ""restaurants"", and hobbled my way under a few too many shopping bags (oops!) to BJ's, where I'm sure I wouldn't be able to get anything more than a sad salad without croutons.  LO AND BEHOLD, gluten free thin crust pizza. And it is a good pizza, y'all.  My server also asked if I was allergic, which made me at least feel like they are aware and might take care not to cross contaminate. But seriously, best gluten free pizza I've had to date, and that actually is saying something. I also got the peach sangria which is almost inedibly sweet; but I think that's my fault.

Sarah B.,"Covington, LA",0,1,,1.0,5/1/2016,"My friends and I have always loved going to BJ's. It has a super laid back atmosphere with a huge menu so everyone can find something they like. However, last night (Saturday, April 30th) was a much different experience than normal. When our group of six arrived at 7:30pm we were greeted with who was perhaps the rudest hostess I have ever encountered. Not only was she very snappy, but she ignored all of our attempts to get her attention after we waited fifteen minutes over our estimated wait time and all other parties who arrived AFTER us had been seated. When she finally did seat us, she all but threw our menus and silverware settings onto the small, square table better suited for four people and stormed off. There were two large, uncleaned booths right next to our table so my friend walked over to the hostess stand to ask her if one of the booths could be cleaned and we could move. The hostess told us we could move to whichever table was cleaned first. Over the next five or so minutes we watched her (seemingly deliberately) clean every other table in our vicinity except for the two that would actually fit our party. When our waitress came by, we mentioned to her that the hostess told us we could move to either of the two tables and she informed us that one of the two tables was bigger than the other. When she attempted to find someone to clean that particular table, the hostess stormed over and actually raised her voice, nearly shouting, at our group and our waitress claiming that we were LYING and she never told us we could move to the larger table. Luckily, while this was happening the other table was being cleaned so we decided rather than cause a scene and possibly get our waitress in trouble, we would move to that table even though it wasn't quite suited for the size of our group. Once we were at the new table we made sure to apologize profusely to our waitress because it was absolutely not her fault. I've never written a Yelp review before, but this hostess' seemingly unwarranted behavior towards customers and a coworker in the middle of a busy restaurant was completely unacceptable and quite jarring in my opinion. I wish I had gotten her name, but that was the last thing on my mind during the commotion. I want to be clear, the one star is not for our waitress or the food (we still love BJ's), but I do not believe the hostess' behavior should be ignored.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-baton-rouge?start=60

Evan B.,"Seattle, WA",19,20,1,1.0,6/13/2012,"Ah, BJs. We meet again. After visiting this restaurant twice in 2009 and finding the place to be lackluster, I decided to give it another try yesterday with my girlfriend.  I beat my girlfriend to the restaurant, so I take a seat at the bar while I waited for her. I ask what the happy hour specials are- they weren't especially impressive. I decided not to order a ridiculously priced $6.00 pint of beer and had water instead.  My girlfriend arrives, we are seated. Our server, Veronica, meekly greets us. She was timid and made us both a bit uncomfortable. After she fetched our water my girlfriend asked what a gin and tonic would cost. ""Umm, I'm not really sure, let me go check"" she replied.. A few minutes later she came back with an estimate. We order the cocktail and begin looking over the menus. What colossal menus BJs has! There are pages and pages of different appetizers, entrees, sandwiches, steaks, seafood, etc. Veronica checks to see if we've made a decision on what to eat. I ask a question about the pizza special for the day and, again, she must go off and find out from someone else. She comes back with a pseudo-answer that doesn't much help me, and not wanting to risk pressing her on the question and making her walk across the place again for clarification, I drop it.  I order the 8 ounce house sirloin, my girlfriend gets the lettuce wrap appetizer with cheese and broccoli soup. The broccoli in her soup was mushy and the soup was disappointing. My salad was good enough.  Our entrees come. My steak is cooked as I asked and is about as good as one can expect a sirloin to be. The baked potato is large and came with everything you'd expect. It was good. The lettuce wraps were also quite good.  I remembered from my previous BJs experiences that the ""pizookie"" was the saving grace of the restaurant. It is a hot chocolate chip cookie served with two scoops of vanilla ice cream that really is just fantastic. I was really looking forward to ordering this. As I'm finishing up my meal Veronica asks if we'd like dessert. I wasn't done with my potato, so I said for now I'd just like more butter and sour cream. She obliges. Once I've finished my potato she brings the checks without asking if we want dessert. Realizing its taken an act of congress for us to get Veronica to do anything efficiently, I decide to not ask for dessert. Veronica picks up our bills a few minutes after dropping them off to us, but we hadn't paid yet. She nervously brought them back to us and apologized. We paid and were on our way, disappointed with the experience as a whole.  BJ's is an overpriced restaurant with too large of a menu. No wonder poor Veronica had no idea what was going on- that menu would take a great deal of time and effort to fully understand. For the product and service we received, I would much rather have gone somewhere else. The food was...pretty good. The service was poor. The prices are high- for what they charge the food (and service) should be excellent. But hey, if you have the money to blow and don't mind sub-standard restaurants, stop on by!

Nick X.,"Baton Rouge, LA",0,11,5,4.0,6/13/2012,"Nice selection of food and great selection of beer. My first trip to BJ's was on a gift card from a relative, I had never heard of the place.  I went not knowing what to expect.  I decided to try the pizza, since it was in their name.  I ordered their signature pizza, which is a deep dish ""supreme"" type pizza. I wasn't too impressed with the pizza, but I've had worse.  The toppings are corse cut, which I found odd.  Large chunks of tomato, onions, etc.  I had vowed to not return because I wasn't impressed. My second trip occurred the following year when I again received another gift card.  I figured I could go this time and try the microbrews at least.  I went in and ordered the Roast Beef sandwich w/ gravy (french dip anywhere else) - this sandwich was AMAZING.  I think there was some grilled onions in there, I don't know, but it was simply the best french dip I had ever had, my previous favorite was Brew Bachers.  My companion had the chili cheeseburger.  The name is a little misleading, you won't be eating this ""burger"" with your hands.  It is served open face and drenched in chili sauce (I believe this was disclosed in the menu).  The burger is massive.  My companion ate roughly half at took home the rest.  I did not personally try it but I was told it was very good. Both times I went was for lunch on a weekend.  The atmosphere was relatively quiet with people of all walks of life coming and going, generally cheerful and relaxed in an environment similar to J. Alexander's, trendy and modern yet a step above typical casual. I tried several of the beer available.  There is an ample selection to choose from for anyone looking for a different taste from the typical domestic pilsner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-baton-rouge?start=100

Chris C.,"Geismar, LA",5,45,4,4.0,3/21/2011,"BJ's is one of our favorite places to bring the kids. It's loud and has a great kids menu, while also giving my wife and I plenty of decent options for dinner. I've also been to BJ's several times for lunch, and they have a pretty good lunch menu with several good deals. Even the deep dish pizza is passable - and that comes from a native Chicagoan. There's perhaps no outstanding cuisine here, but I've yet to find anything on the large (think Cheesecake Factory) menu that was objectionable, either.  The only drawback to this place is consistently slow service. Usually the servers are nice and seem well-intentioned, but food and drinks (other than soft drinks) take forever to arrive. Usually this doesn't bother me, but recently I had lunch here with a relatively large group. I ordered a burger without their ""special sauce,"" clearly noted by the server. When the burger arrived with the sauce, the server was extremely apologetic. However, due to the glacial pace at which the kitchen seems to move, everyone else had finished eating by the time my correct dish was served.

I visited BJ's a few times.  On my last visit, I had a waiter who opted to socialize with a table of female customers instead of dealing with the table I was at with mostly male customers.  He also made numerous mistakes with our order and was very slow to deliver. Sadly, there are many who castigate Baton Rouge for having bad culinary choices, and BJ's seems to perpetuate that stereotype.  There are far better places in the Mall of Louisiana vicinity--you just have to drive a bit on Bluebonnet to find them, although the restaurants on the Bluebonnet side of the mall are pretty good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-baton-rouge?start=120

We didn't complain about the taste of the food.  We told him the issues and didn't know why he was brought out.  Now here's the kicker, her meal was comped at 9.50 i think and then a second Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo was added at 12.50 and comped, but my entree was still there.  The kitchen manager did offer to remake but at that point, we couldn't.  There was another table next to us whose waiter my girlfriend knew, he seemed great.  Couple of guys sat on the other side of the wall from us, sat after us, got their food and finished before us.  And the bad thing is our waitress wasn't that busy.  She only has 2-3 tables including us.   Oh, even better, when the girlfriend arrived she asked to be seated in the bar area.  She was ignored.  A different girl brought her to the booth, and she asked again to sit in the bar, the girl made eye contact with her and sat her in that booth....

Matthew G.,"Prairieville, LA",0,1,,1.0,12/29/2012,"My wife and I, on one of our very few nights out from our kids, decided to eat at BJ's before we went to a movie.  We walked in on a Friday night around 8:30 and sat right down.  Our server greeted us promptly and we ordered 2 beers and the lettuce wrap appetizer.  After about 5-10 minutes our appetizer arrived but our drinks didn't arrive until a few minutes later.  Without prompting our server said he had ""stuff to do"" and that is why our drinks were late.  The lettuce wraps were awful.  For almost $11 we got four pieces of lettuce that was full of holes and tears.  For that price I expect firm, whole pieces of lettuce that can actually hold the food that comes with them.  We then ordered our dinners.  My wife ordered a turkey cobb sandwich.  I tried to order a small, whole wheat deep dish pizza but the server told me that the whole wheat only came in a mini size.  So I ordered the mini Mediterranean pizza on whole wheat crust.  A runner brought our food out.  My wife's sandwich was supposed to come with applewood bacon, avocados, and a blue cheese dressing on it.  It came out without all 3 of those things.  My pizza came out on ""white"" crust instead of the whole wheat.  We explained to our server the mistake on the sandwich and I just decided to eat my pizza.  He said he would be right back.  When he returned he had a plate of sliced avocados and bacon.  He explained that the sandwich guy was new and that my wife could just fix her sandwich herself.  If we wanted to make a sandwich we could have done that at home!  I asked the hostess to send the manager to our table.  He also explained that the sandwich guy was new and that some people didn't mind putting those things on their sandwiches.  At no point were we offered a ""new"" sandwich.  To their credit after my wife explained that she didn't want to eat the sandwich they did take it off our bill.  Poor service from the bar, kitchen, wait staff, and management.  I look forward to the restaurant that takes this one's place in a few years.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-baton-rouge?start=140
