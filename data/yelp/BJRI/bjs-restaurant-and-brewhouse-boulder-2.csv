Katie G.,"Boulder, CO",180,25,,2.0,1/20/2015,Crappy pedestrian food. Everything I've had is either bland or overly salty without having any other flavor. The beer is good though.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-boulder-2?start=60
Wyatt J.,"Renton, WA",0,2,2,3.0,9/13/2014,Just ate most of a pazookie. Feel ok. This place is dimly lit hard to read menu if you have night blindness. Had beer too it tasted okay but pazookie doesn't pair well. Good day.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-boulder-2?start=60
Skip T.,"Brighton, CO",12,38,5,5.0,5/31/2015,"Talk about an extensive menu! If you can't find something to eat here, I don't know what to tell you. I had a burger, my wife had a salad. We both liked our food. The best part, though, was the beer. The manager, Cody, brought us a few tasters if some of their rotational brews that were amazing. My wife, Toni, even liked their session IPA, a first. I liked all of them, which isn't all that surprising. Overall, great experience. Good food, good beer, and Cody really made us feel right at home. Thanks, we'll be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-boulder-2?start=60
Miriam P.,"San Diego, CA",44,106,19,3.0,3/19/2015,Good service and pretty good food.  I've been to this location of BJ's twice - both on company luncheons.  I've tried the Greek chicken tacos and the Asian chopped salad.  Both delicious choices.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-boulder-2?start=60
Alissa R.,"Tucson, AZ",285,296,470,3.0,5/29/2013,"This is solely based on the bar experience here. We were on our way to a hike in Estes Park when I had had just WAY too much car time (hate riding in cars for an extended amount of time) I was craving a bloody mary and spotted this place.  Welcomed by a friendly hostess we headed straight to the long bar, where the Bartender was quick to help us. My friend sampled a few ciders before deciding on a great lavender infused one. My bloody mary was not only tasty and spicy, but it did the job and the rest of the drive to Estes Park was much more tolerable.  We did not order any food but the menu is expansive and very chain oriented, something for everyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-boulder-2?start=60
Margaret C.,"Boulder, CO",514,511,105,4.0,2/24/2013,"Saturday night was my first time trying BJ's in the new location.   A friend was celebrating something and chose this restaurant.    The menu here seemed to have more choices than it had when it was on Pearl St.   I wasn't really hungry as I have been ill during the past week or so. The other people at our table ordered pasta dishes.   I ordered a sandwich.   Mine was fine.  The others liked theirs. What was really outstanding, though, was our service.   The place was fairly crowded when we first arrived.   From beginning to end, though, we received excellent service.  That was nice. I have read the other reviews and can only conclude that there has been some effort on the part of this restaurant to improve.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-boulder-2?start=60
Nicollette R.,"Louisville, CO",26,4,,3.0,4/4/2015,The Meals were absolutely delicious but service was terrible! Sat at the table for 15-20 minutes before I had to get up and just tell someone we haven't been asked for drinks or if we were ready! Of course once we got orders in they were ready within minutes.

Vincent V.,"Seattle, WA",83,181,276,1.0,1/28/2013,"Very courteous and helpful service. Except for the tacos, the food appears too salty. Shrimp scampi comes with heavily seasoned (salt and lemon juice) which may appeal to you if you're a heavy drinker. When the waitress offered to ask the kitchen to make it less intense they made a new dish exactly the same way. The shrimp tasted good though. For all of BJ's attempt to offer a healthier cuisine, such as the lower calorie menu options, they still appear to have a lot of work ahead in the sodium (and sugar) department.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-boulder-2?start=60
Marianne L.,"Boulder, CO",212,142,34,4.0,12/2/2015,"BJ's may not be the snazziest or hippest place to eat, but it certainly is dependable in terms of flavor.  My husband may have had the best cooked chicken breast of his life one time, only to get the normal, average, slightly-dry chicken breast the next.  So the jury is out on that one.  I however, enjoyed my steak and salmon that I've ordered so far.  They seem to be busy every time we've gone - and of course I signed up for the VIP program.  I think that it's a reasonably priced meal for the qualify of food that you receive.  The s'mores dessert is WAY TOO SWEET though.  So I wouldn't necessarily recommend this place for desserts because it seems like all their desserts are overly sweet.  Give me good flavor with a pleasant amount of sweetness anytime, but holy moly it was way too sweet for me.  Anyways, I like to think that this place will become a place I frequent regularly for good ol' American food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-boulder-2?start=60
Kristen G.,"Richardson, TX",26,27,,3.0,8/22/2014,"This BJ's is sort of disappointing. If you come when business is slow, then everything is great. However, if you come when it is busy, service is so slow it takes your waitress forever to even take your orders and the food coming out is even slower. But like I said, during non-peak times this place is great. The food is sooooo good. I recommend the avocado egg rolls, calamari, clam chowder, and any deep dish pizza. The spicy jalapeño burger is also a must have. As for drinks, try the Buffalo Bite. It is surprisingly amazing. My only complaint besides them not being able to handle a packed house would be the price. The food is good, but it isn't worth what it is priced at.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-boulder-2?start=60
C M.,"Cincinnati, OH",34,21,8,3.0,12/3/2014,BJs Brewhouse has some things I love and some things not so much.  Avocado spring rolls are my favorite!  I would drive out of my way for those.  Their beer is decent.  Burgers and sandwiches are pretty good.  Love the small bites menu!  Not a fan of the deep dish pizza though.  It's all bread!  Deep dish pizzas should be loaded with meat and cheese and yumminess and not a loaf of bread with some sauce and thins slices of pepperoni on top.  Avoid the pizza and you will enjoy the restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-boulder-2?start=60
Elaine Z.,"Boulder, CO",19,159,10,2.0,3/8/2013,"We went on a Friday evening around 7ish, the wait was only about 3 minutes.   Busy, but the server was prompt and enthusiastic.  Very enthusiastic.  Made me wonder about his caffeine intake, but his service was excellent. I got the crispy chicken sandwich.  The chicken was dry, the bread decent, soft and not too crunchy.  The skinny fries were good.  Hubby got the gluten free pizza.  I tried a piece.  It was soggy and unappetizing, like a cheap frozen pizza that's been shoved to the back of the freezer.  The kind you eventually offer to your babysitter because you just don't want to have to eat it but don't want to throw it out.   Also, what's up with the plates?  The mozzarella sticks came out on a square plate.  I can accept square plates on the basis of easier storage, but frequently I find I need to turn the plate around to easier access something on it, and it's much easier to do with a round plate.  My sandwich and fries came out on an oval one, which I'll accept as a nod to sandwiches in those oval baskets, even though it forced them to cut my sandwich into an odd shape.   But the pizza . . . the ROUND pizza . . . came out on a TRIANGULAR plate.  Whose bright idea was THAT?   Also tried the Strawberry Patch.  Kind of like a pina colada, but with strawberries.  Not strong at all.  There were more drinks on the menu that I would want to try than any of the food.  Yeah.  I'm a sissy drinker, but if you put strawberries in it you'll get my attention.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-boulder-2?start=60

Joel F.,"Denver, CO",22,123,14,3.0,5/3/2013,"Hi folks, thanks for coming to BJs, I will give you 35 minutes to read through our menu, or you can wait for the feature length movie to come out. I am not going to bash my experience, the server was great, the food was tasty, and the meal not TOO pricey. This is a solid neutral place to take the family or a medium to large group. There is something for everyone, and it will be decent. Though not a vegetarian, I try to watch how much meat I eat, and there were several meatless options that were real creations! Beer was good....

Danny R.,"Boulder, CO",117,31,7,2.0,2/12/2013,"Maybe the best thing about BJ's is that you can say ""LET'S GO GET SOME BEEJAYS"" like Paul Rudd when you plan to go there. That's an unpaid endorsement for the film ""I Love You Man"", it has nothing to do with this restaurant.  I work really close to BJ's and we used to come here for happy hour a lot. It feels like what it is- a big corporate restaurant that tries to pass itself off as a microbrewery.  The service here is super slow. Always. The happy hour pricing isn't even that good. That's why we stopped going here. Now me and my co-workers to to Cantina Laredo up the street, which isn't great either, but it's got a better happy hour.  I work in retail.

I tried for five minutes to get the bartenders' attention and couldn't even get eye contact. Gave up and left. The floor was also waxed almost to the point of being a skating rink.

Leanne G.,"Lafayette, CO",405,345,293,3.0,3/18/2013,"This is a large restaurant in Boulder, which we don't have that many of. That means you have a good chance of getting a table without a long wait, even if you have a large party and its peak mealtime. The food is OK. Nothing really incredible, but good. Its a great place for children while being classier than Chili's, but not much different than California Pizza Kitchen. I like that they brew their own beer. However, its my favorite that they brew their own SODA! My favorite is the Cream Soda or the Root Beer. So while its not my favorite, I like going there and think its got a place in the Boulder dining community.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-boulder-2?start=60

When I seek refreshment in the form of BUBBLED WATER to wash down horribly over salted food at a overpriced pretentious eatery, I head on over to BJ's Brewhouse.

Nikki H.,"Boulder, CO",1239,448,201,4.0,1/4/2018,"I feel like this is one of those places we end up when we don't know what the hell we want to eat and can't agree on anything because BJ's has everything. I've never had to wait long for a table, and the service has always been great. I suppose if you came here on a busy Friday night, you might wait a bit though. The ambiance is trying to be more upscale, but it still has more of a sport bar vibe. Imagine Buffalo Wild Wings and Bar Louie had a baby and it specialized in brews, that's BJs.  If you're looking for a place for a date night, I can't say I'd recommend this spot, but if you have been together awhile and you're hungry and can't agree on where to eat, this place will suit your needs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-boulder-2
Melanie L.,"Naples, FL",18,16,,1.0,9/22/2017,"Arrived on a Friday night so expected it to be busy. We decided to sit in the bar area and it took 8 minutes to even get acknowledged. And then the server arrived with a trainee. Really?? Who works with a trainee on a Friday night??  We ordered appetizers and sat for 10 minutes (again, in the bar area with several servers passing by us) with our glasses empty before flagging down the trainee. He apologized and said our potato skins were still being cooked. Huh? You put the skins in the fryer, it wasn't like we were ordering a well-done steak.  We asked for the check and left immediately.

Maura S.,"Evanston, IL",212,72,368,4.0,3/6/2017,"I've been to BJ's a few time and always have a good experience. The food is great most of the time and the pazookis (deep dish cookies) are amazing! The service is usually great but sometimes can be slow on busy nights. The noise level can a little loud sometimes but is usually not bad. Its a great place to bring groups and pretty much any age. Also a good place to watch sports, they have good TV placement.  This time around we showed up to BJ's with a huge group and they took great care of us. They split all of our checks and got almost every detail of the orders correct.  I ordered the chicken fettucini alfredo and it was delicious! I ate it for two more days after that, it was a lot of food. My boyfriend and I split the mozzarella sticks which were great. He had hickory brisket and bacon burger and loved it. I didn't try it but it looked insanely good. At our table we also had a pepperoni pizza, the bacon guacamole deluxe burger, and a few other things. All of it was great!

Daryl B.,"Edmonds, WA",0,4,2,3.0,4/30/2017,"In a town where food frustration can run high, BJ's is sure to pleasure the hungry wanderer, although the discerning connoisseur may find it lacking. A slightly disconcerting ambiance combines the class of a sit down restaurant with the cheap thrills of a sports bar. The food was quite excellent although there was a reliance on fried foods. Keep in mind that when ordering the burger, the meat might be a little too much to get your mouth around. The service was exceptional, be sure to leave a big tip for BJ's. 3 stars  After an average incubation period, stool was large in quantity although easily passed. Consistency was an issue during the expulsion phase but the sheer quantity of mass purged from your system will leave you feeling light and free. 3 stars.

It took a long time to get a 2nd beer. Also, I had my credit card in the cup for at least 15 minutes before he noticed. It all started with him not hearing that I wanted a lemon with my water. Then, my medium burger was well done and the fried egg on top was hard cooked. To top it off, it's Wednesday and burgers are $10...he charged me $14.  Stay away on Wednesdays.

I am immediately greeted by the bartender, Jessica, who asks me what i want to drink. I'm unsure and she begins making recommendations and giving me samples of beers. The first few are a total miss for me, they are still all very interesting. She recommends a porter and its delicious, I ask for a beer that'll go well with a burger. She recommends a red ale. It's perfect and I order a pint and then proceed to order a portobello burger.  The red ale is subtle and light. It has a smoothness to it with an after taste that's almost sweet. Bjs also has other beers on tap such as Averys and Oskar Blues, Kona, Newcastle, and Sanitas.   The burger was cooked perfectly and the fries were also good. However they aren't anything to rave over.  Company policy is also against violent programming so no fights can be watched here. Bummer.

Jill E.,"Boulder, CO",27,167,12,3.0,11/7/2015,"I've been here many times with friends and family, in it's new location as well as the old ones. Didn't realize it was a chain until the bartender mentioned it. For the most part, the food is just ok, not spectacular however, for the prices they charge, but the portions are large. Too salty though for me, so I have to ask them to skip all the salt where they can. I'll salt the food myself, if it needs it.  The last time I was in, on Halloween to watch game 4 of the Baseball World Series, I first ordered a thin crust pizza. It had waaaayyyy to much cheese on it, not enough veggies, and the crust was mushy. Made me feel a bit ill and almost killed my appetite. The waiter removed it from my bill and I ordered the Asian salad with chicken instead. It was a large dish, but also just ok. I thought the chicken was under cooked, so I pushed that all to the side. I took over half the salad home and recooked the chicken before daring to eat it the next day.  The alcohol selection is good, though one time I ordered an Irish coffee and it was terrible. The bartenders are wonderful people though, so I let it slide. I like the beer selection here and the wine choices are good as well. Service is a bit iffy at times. Earlier this year, I met a friend here for happy hour and we were ignored by our waitress. Waited 20 minutes for the waitress to come to our table with water and to take our order. And no, it wasn't busy. This was not good as my friend had some not so good news that day and she really needed cheering up. Having bad service only made her more unhappy and angry too. Needless to say, I left a very small tip and a note explaining why. The next time I came in, to meet others for happy hour, I asked the waitress to please not ignore us like the last girl did, and she made sure our table was covered well. Tipped her well for being on her game.  Noise levels here can get pretty loud, depending on when you come. My friends and family like to come here for the big screen TVs. I like those too, when I'm interested in a game, but putting the large one behind the bar into multi-screen mode is very distracting for some people, myself included.

I had the boneless wings because I haven't been able to find great wings since I moved away from the Midwest area, so I was really expecting something tasty. These were among the worst wings I've ever had. I probably ate 2-3 pieces because every bite had that weird tendony/chewy/gross part of the chicken texture and I couldn't stomach it. Each wing was about 1/2 sauced, there were so many 'bald spots' where there was zero sauce, so that was disappointing as well. My boyfriend's burger was subpar, and his brother's chicken was dry.

Stephen B.,"Longmont, CO",4,11,,2.0,2/23/2014,"My family of  four went last night around 9:30 pm. For a Saturday night neither the bar area or the  restaurant appeared busy. There were several servers, busboys,and managers working. We were seated in a booth and assured our  server  would  be right over. Several of the staff passed by  our  table. After about 10 minutes, I told my wife that if no one came to our table be ]fore I  counted to 30, I would go to the  hostess stand to let them know we were still waiting on a server. Just then our  server showed up with two glasses of water for the  four of us, which I found odd. Why did she  only have 2 glasses of water? Incidentally, I told her that two glasses were plenty. If her plan was to bring us water, why not  bring all four at the same time. So, now  we have water. She was not ready to take our  drink order because she had to take care  of another table, so she left. Now I am feeling like the service is pretty poor. I have been to plenty of BJs locations, but this was my first time at the new one in Boulder. My wife and I both worked  in restaurants in college, so I am willing to give the waiter a pass if it is busy, or if they were double or triple sat. I surveyed the area, watched what our server was doing, and decided she was not ""in the weeds"". We finally got  our  drink order placed, and then our food order. The food was typically BJs quality. I have no complaints there. Through out the meal our server checked on us once twice, and left me waiting a fairly long time for my second beer.  Overall the service was mediocre. I am not really sure what the issue was with the server. Maybe lack of training, or maybe she just did not want to be there. She was nice enough and did not  give off that I am bothered by customers vibe that you  can get some times.  I will go here again, but when I pay a premium compared to say, Red Robin, or Chili's, I expect better.

Good atmosphere, what i would expect from an all American family dining place with a sports type bar. We were seated pretty quickly and drinks came out on time.  I ordered one of the chicken pasta dishes can't remember exactly what it was. My pasta-  It came out lukewarm and soggy and flavorless. Theres really nothing to describe it except those 3 words. I wasn't that hungry to begin with so I just ate the artichokes and some salad. My friend who didn't order anything else but her pasta really couldn't stand hers. My pasta's chicken wasn't burnt like hers. She called a manager over and they sorted it out. She got a different entree altogether and was very pleased with one of the burgers. The fries that came with were very good! When the manager asked about my pasta dish, I just said I'd rather not get anything else, and that although mine was cold and flavorless and soggy as well, I ate most of the chicken so I wasn't expecting a totally new dish. When my bill came I was surprised that my entree was waived. I felt bad that they did that, since I ate most of my chicken and artichokes. I just didn't touch the spaghetti itself. But that was very thoughtful of them.  Service was great. The waiter was attentive even on a busy night and he was more than happy to bring the new dishes and ask how it was.  Food.

We were ready to leave and possibly hop across the street to Baker Street Pub ... instead someone walked close enough to us that  I literally had to grab him to get his attention.  Yes, 2 minutes later... a waitress shows up.. hallelujah!  This was 8:00 pm, so not the busy dinner rush.  We ordered two entrees - a 'cobb' salad and a lemon chicken pasta dish. The pasta was horrible.  It was as if they had spilled a full salt shaker's contents on top of our dish.. it was extremely salty.  My husband likes salt and most of the time will even add salt to his food, but even he said this was over-the-top... WAY over the top on the salt, not edible.   So, the cobb salad was strange.  Not your usual cobb... it was tiny pieces of chopped, what looked like iceberg lettuce, a little bacon, crumbled feta I believe, and really unsure what else was on that salad.  It was also very salty.  Actually we weren't sure if it was just the massive salt in our mouths still from the pasta that we were still tasting, but nonetheless... not a good salad.  This food was WAY sub par for the price, and the service was lacking. When we told our waitress about our disappointment with our food, she did send out the manager to talk to us.  The manager seemed to insinuate that we were making up the salt thing... she said 'huh, not sure why it would taste like salt when we don't even add salt to that sauce...'... and 'maybe it was the ranch dressing... that can be salty'...    I don't know, it was SALTY manager, so please believe us and give us some credit.  Anyway, she took the food off of the bill, and so we paid for our beers and were on our way.... never to return.  Still hungry.  At least the beer gave us some nourishment until we could get home and eat PBJ's.   Sad, because we had been to the BJ's on Pearl Street back in the day, and it was really good food (pizza) and an enjoyable atmosphere/experience overall.  We also had lunch at the Westminster location previously and it was much better food and service than this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-boulder-2?start=80

The thing is, I am one of the most forgiving customers you will ever have...and this place still made me angry.  To start...the food was really terrible. The appetizer was chili verde on fries. It was plopped on the plate with little attention to detail. The presentation was sloppy and uninviting. I had the the chicken club with bacon. The chicken had no flavor and the consistency of a dry sponge. The fries were obviously frozen and deep fried. My husband had the Maui Maui with some sort of citrus rice. The fish was dry, flavorless, and very poorly prepared. But the worst part of the dish was the rice. It was half boiled and tasted like they squeezed a bunch of lemon juice on it.  Next, the service. We were seated by a very nice host, who was joking and inviting. However, our server was obviously disinterested in providing us a decent dining experience. He took forever to get our drinks and never once asked us about a refill. When the entrees arrived, he never came to ask how the food tasted. Again, I'm a very forgiving customer.

Cindy H.,"Littleton, CO",2,20,7,4.0,8/21/2014,"After moving our daughter into her dorm, we were famished!  After stumbling across BJs we stopped to eat.  Although the service was a bit slow, our server was very nice and personable.   I very much enjoyed my California Chicken Club, it was delicious!  They even got my 'Sally' request correctly and put the garlic mayonnaise on the side, (this does not always occur at restaurants).  My husband and daughter both enjoyed the classic burger.  I was thrilled that they had two types of fries to choose from - shoestring and wedges!  As I LOVE wedges, while my family enjoys the other.  I would definitely return!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-boulder-2?start=40
Taylor D.,"Broomfield, CO",16,12,,4.0,4/11/2015,"My boyfriend and I FINALLY decided to try this place out. I was definitely surprised by the menu (and that a pasta dish is more expensive than the mahi mahi my boyfriend got). I decided to get the pulled pork sandwich with their seasoned wedges and no slaw (not a fan). The sandwich was amazing and so were the fries! There wasn't too much sauce (just right). I shared it with my boyfriend who also got the mahi mahi. He liked it but thought it could use more of the glaze or whatever was on the fish. After we decided to get a dessert and it was amazing! We got one of the cookie things with the ice cream. We decided on the Oreo one and all I have to say is... Get one. I would go back more for the dessert than the meal!  The only downside to the visit is that our server seemed sort of overwhelmed. I got my drink and it was empty throughout my meal and was never refilled, he never asked. My boyfriend got a beer and loved it, but he didn't get a refill, and a lot of the time servers will bring him a water just in case, and this waiter didn't.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-boulder-2?start=40
Megan E.,"Columbus, OH",79,297,51,3.0,1/4/2013,"I would say 2.5 - we came here after the movies for a pick-me-up.  I had the mac & cheese and DH ordered the wontons and a root beer. The mac & cheese was ok - creamy but not really with cheese so much as butter and stuff, I wanted it to be thicker and have more cheese.   The root beer was good though, and DH enjoyed his dish, although with $3 and 3 pieces, it was a bit steep. Service was slow and the place is loud, I think overall I liked the old location better but it's worth giving them a shot for yourself, just don't come on game day if you want it to be quiet!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-boulder-2?start=40
Tiffany P.,"Gulf Breeze, FL",30,6,4,4.0,12/29/2013,"Lunch on Sunday afternoon, at the start of a Broncos game. The place filled up quickly. Our server (Raphael??) was very nice and attentive. Made recommendations that we enjoyed.   Boneless wings were moist and spicy. We also tried the stuffed mushrooms, great  sauce on them. Yum.  Pizza was ok. Hubby really liked it. I liked the crust brushed with garlic butter.  Great flavor but not overly garlicky.    Great atmosphere too. Sports bar area but felt more grown up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-boulder-2?start=40
Ariel S.,"Silverthorne, CO",150,36,67,3.0,1/17/2016,Food was good. Service was ok- he seemed distracted watching football. Manager did his job well making sure we were ok!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-boulder-2?start=40
Mary M.,"Boulder, CO",10,68,3,1.0,2/15/2016,"I have been frequenting BJ's since they were on Pearl St. Mall.  My kids love it there.  We usually sit in the same booth every time we go, and my 2 boys always request that we eat dinner there.  I was entertaining friends, and their kids there for my son's birthday, and realized that I'd left my wallet at home.  Obviously, I was trying to keep this information from my guests because I excused myself from the table and went to speak to my waiter in private.  I told my waiter of my embarrassing situation, and requested the bill and told him I'd be back in less than 20 minutes.  What happened next was so mortifying!  The manager and waiter come up to the table and I got up to meet them, because, again, I was embarrassed by the situation already. The female manager asks me for my drivers license....   Um....  I just told you people I didn't have my wallet.  I gave you my address, and I'm with a table full of kids.  I offered to leave my purse there for her, but she declined... I'm not going to go through a extravagant story just to dine and dash!  Then, as we were leaving the restaurant, the female manager and another male manager were up front just staring at us as we left!  I came back in less than 15 minutes and paid.  I told the female manager how absolutely awkward she had made things, and they have now lost a longtime regular, who has never spent less than $85 in a visit.  She actually looked at me and told me that she just had a family walk on their bill last week.  I wonder if that family approached their waiter and explained their situation and expressed their intention to come back and pay.  Mistakes happen, and I would never have treated someone like a criminal! On a side note.  We were there for an hour and 15 minutes, and my son didn't get his birthday dessert or a birthday song to him because of all of this ruckus.  Thanks, BJ's!  Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-boulder-2?start=40
Alina J.,"Superior, CO",0,24,,4.0,9/12/2015,"Love this spot on weekends.  If Joe W. was our server everytime, I would definitely be giving 5 stars.  We walk in and I don't even have to order my green tea, it's at the table with our water right when he walks up! The food is better too, it's like Joe knows how to put orders in properly to get the best result!  I love the deep dish ravioli, but I replace the pepperoni & sausage with ground beef.  He also gives great recommendations.  If you stop over, make sure you ask for Joe as your server & you will not be disappointed with the service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-boulder-2?start=40
Leigh Z.,"Austin, TX",0,287,135,4.0,6/27/2015,Went in for dinner with my family on a Sat night but were there early....like a bit after five....So they weren't super busy yet. We were seated immediately and our waiter was efficient and helpful. The drinks and the food we ordered was very good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-boulder-2?start=40
Linda C.,"Denver, CO",0,38,,5.0,6/12/2016,"We were greeted by friendly people. Our waitress was amazing. The food was delicious! This was our third visit to this location and we have yet to be disappointed!! We ordered the mozzarella and tomato salad to start. It was out of this world fantastic!! I wanted to take about five more orders of it home with me. The dressing was fresh and tasty and the tomatoes were just the right ripeness.  So, so yummy!!! My husband ordered the BJ's favorite pizza - as he always does. It did not let him down. (I don't like pizza, but I like this pizza.) I ordered the chicken and quinoa dish. (Don't remember it's ""official"" name.)The chicken was cooked to perfection! Very moist and flavorful. I liked the quinoa which was flavored with spinach, tomatoes and other good stuff. I loved it. My only ""complaint"" was that it had a sort of lemony flavor and I'm not a fan of lemony things. I looked at the menu and there was no mention of lemon. Next time I would order it and ask them to omit whatever gave it that aspect. (The server said they use several different types of oils and that it probably came from one of the oils.) I cannot remember the server's name, but she was GREAT! She did an excellent job and had a fun sense of humor. She seemed to genuinely enjoy being there. She said she has the mozzarella salad for lunch with avocado if that helps the manager identify her!  So, I'm going to end on a negative note. We dined there at 5:00 on Friday June 10th and it was FREEZING in there!!! My husband never gets cold and HE thought it was very cold as well. I think they were anticipating a big crowd later and were just trying to get ahead of things. We always have dessert, but were too cold. We drive from Lakewood to come to this BJ's. It is worth the drive!! You've got to try it! Wear long sleeves, though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-boulder-2?start=40
Michael B.,"Boulder, CO",11,3,,2.0,11/1/2015,My girlfriend and I visited this restaurant the other night and were not totally happy. The food was okay but it took about an hour to turn our table when the restaurant was really slow. We were trying to make a movie and we were almost late to that because it took 40 minutes to prep my fish tacos and her burger.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-boulder-2?start=40
