Tasha V.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",264,285,152,4.0,4/6/2017,"I am always a fan of this brewhouse. I enjoy their pizzas, pastas and appetizers. Of course you can't go wrong with the pizooki for dessert! As for the service, our server at this location was very attentive and kind. He offered items on the menu, when my Mother in law wasn't sure of what to get. She asked about the clam chowder soup and he brought her a sample.  Dine or Dash? Dine.

Cindy V.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",5,57,68,4.0,2/25/2017,"We love going to BJ's but I think this is our first time in this location.  The wait was about 20 minutes on an early Saturday evening, not bad at all. Our table was right in front of the big screen, perfect spot for watching UCLA v Arizona hoops. The ambiance was that of a cavernous tavern, copper sculptured ceilings, lots of happy patrons. Good vibes. Our server, Lyndsie, was great. Attentive and quick at bringing drink refills. We were not in a Pizookie mood so we asked her about the beignets.  She was quick to inform us, ""it's really good"". We have tried all the Pizookie flavors so we gave it a shot. Man, that beignet was soooo good...topped with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and surrounded by wedged strawberries   Thanks for the tip, Lyndsie!

He was on top of everything and took care of us all night and he was such a sweetheart. Even though he was busy, he continuously came and made sure everything was ok. We laughed all night and after our week, we needed that. It was like we were old friends.  We enjoyed our food but we enjoyed Brandon even more. We'll definitely be coming back.

Tricia C.,"San Marcos, CA",28,37,27,1.0,10/26/2017,"Extremely poor service. Came here after dinner across the street for a few drinks. Drinks were horribly made and the cups smelled like mildew.  Waiter was stiff and condescending. Moved to the bar and the bartender took our order, realized he forgot to make the drinks about 15 minutes later (keep in mind he spent a lot of time just chatting with other patrons and coworkers). Told him to the cancel the order and he allowed us to leave without an apology. Ended up going back to Tempo where we had dinner for cocktails where they had much better service and quality.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=20
Matt S.,"Placentia, CA",13,75,157,4.0,4/1/2017,"We came here on free pizookie day! In order to get the pizookie, you need to spend at least $10 on food - which isn't hard to do as most items are over $10. We shared our food, and ordered the boneless wings, with both garlic Parmesan sauce and root beer BBQ sauce.  The BBQ is nice and sweet - perfect flavor.  We liked the garlic Parmesan, but it is rich, so I would take turns eating 1 at a time, switching between wings. The other item we got was the great white pizza.  It comes with chicken, alfredo sauce, tomatoes, and mushrooms.  We didn't get mushrooms on it.  The pizza was really good and we very much enjoyed it. On to dessert! We each got our own pizookies, (fatties).  I ordered the original, chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream.  It was so yummy and I actually ate the whole thing.  I felt so sick, but so good at the same time.

Our server, Kathryn F., was treating the table next to us completely different. She was constantly checking on them and made sure that their food came out fresh. She did a great job with them I'm sure but my table was kept waiting and ignored. We ended up waiting over 30 minutes for 2 small desserts, which were beignet, and they weren't fresh. When we got them they were so cold it felt like a bread roll that's been sitting out for at least an hour. All in all food was pretty decent but the service..deeply unsatisfactory.

But when we got there they said they had not received the message. And then we ordered an appetizer and the mozzarella sticks had no cheese. I love this place but this specific restaurant was not a great visit.

Noemi F.,"Whittier, CA",15,8,3,1.0,8/25/2017,"Service at this location is horrible! BJ's is a favorite of my husband's so we went there to celebrate his birthday last night. There was no wait, so we got seated right away which was nice. Our original service was fine, but he was hard to find.  It took my 9 year old hunting down our server to order our appetizer. It took a while for our appetizer to arrive and when it did we couldn't eat it because no plates were given. The kids sat there patiently staring ...drooling over the flatbread pizza. :(  We didn't see our server, so after waiting a few minutes I asked the hostess to track him down.  I guess she couldn't find him either so she ended up getting our plates. Then, before we could take a first bite our entrees arrived. That's terrible timing! Asked the server to take the food back to keep it warm at least. We rushed through our app and again sat there waiting to spot our server. Finally, I spot him, signaled that we needed him at our table and I'm pretty sure he knotted ..he was carrying a stack of dishes back to the kitchen so I assume he'd come see us right after ---especially given the timing mishap. NOPE! He went to take another table's order. Ugh!!!! That was it! We walked out.  I explained to the manager what had happened. He was understating and offered to move us to another table or get a different server, but at that point my husband's birthday dinner was completely ruined and he just wanted to go home.

Alejandrina R.,"Anaheim, CA",2,10,,1.0,11/18/2017,"My experience here was probably the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant.  My coworkers and I decided to come here yesterday after work for dinner.  We left our workplace at about 8:20 P.M, and one of the women in our group had reserved a spot for us on the app at that time.  We arrived and waited... By this time it was already nine, and we still did not have a table.  When inquiring about our reservation, we were told that submitting one through the app wasn't sufficient.  Then what is? We were told our party would be next to make up for the inconvenience.  Another one of the women in our team ordered chicken wings, bone in.  The amount of time it took for them to arrive was pretty long.  And when they arrived, they arrived...boneless.  We let the waiter know, so he removed them and left.  Another twenty minutes pass, and they come back with the same platter of boneless wings (now cold).  We let them know again that we wanted them bone in, and when they do arrive bone in (the third time), they were cold.  By this time we request to speak to a manager.  We then proceeded to order the rest of our food, which also took long to arrive.  A mom and pop place would have had better food for less money.  The pros would be that our waiter remained kind and courteous through the whole situation (even after we requested to speak to a manager) and the pizookie was tasty.  I would only come back here if this was the only restaurant in California, but it isn't, so...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=20

Whatever. I gave them my number and it worked fine. Unfortunately, the hostess tried to sit us 20 minutes later at a dirty table with food smears not only on the table but on the floor as well. Whatever. That's not her fault. My mother asked if we could just sit at one of the other clean tables, but she told us to wait back up front so they could clean it. Fine. My parents were pretty annoyed at this point. I was still fine, but I've worked customer service. I know stuff happens. I get it. The final straw came when we waited up front and were ignored while our table was cleaned, the hostess clearly wanting to wash her hands of us. Two other groups were then sat before us, one of which got our table. We put our almost finished beers aside and left.

The atmosphere seems to always be good, a little loud sometimes, but nothing that is unbearable. Recently came to celebrate a friends birthday, luckily the host of the dinner was smart enough to make a reservation way in advance, as the restaurant was packed and there were a groups of people outside waiting to get in. My go-to and seems like a lot of peoples go-to here is the pizza. If you like deep dish pizza then you will be fine here as the pizza is alright. Not too shabby by my books, and I love me some pizza. If you do not like deep dish then you might have some problems. I once had the none deep dish pizza and the crust tasted horrible, not my kind of thing. My fave pizza here is he BBQ chicken. Chicken, Cheese, BBQ Sauce, Onions and Cilantro with Tomato Chunks. Yummy! For dessert you have to get a Pizookie! Warm cookie (chocolate chip, peanut butter, white chocolate chip [I think]) baked in a round tin, and topped with vanilla bean ice cream. Soft and creamy goodness!

My issue came down to the food, and how the situation was handled. First, our food took about 35 minutes to come out. Specifically, my husband ordered a steal medium. His steak came out well done. The waitress came back to take it back but asked him to slide the meat on a separate plate, leaving just the sides. Meanwhile, it took another 30 minutes for them to bring back out the steak. It was odd that they didn't just bring out a full meal, but rather just a slab of meat.  I had no choice but to ask for a manager who offered to compensate the meal, which was nice, although Yelp check offered buy 1 get 1 free so there was not much incentive. I explained to the manager that it was about free food so to speak but the overall experience we were having. A few other things had occurred that don't need to be mentioned.

Watermelon Feta Salad (something lighter if you want) I hear the beers on tap are good as well but I did not try any, maybe next time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=80

She took our drink order at first but never came back for our food order. She like to hover around the kitchen exit and talk to other employees. Once the bar got busier a co-worker sat at the bar and she spent majority of her time chitchatting with her instead of attending to the paying guest. She continued to talk about drinking with co-workers, parties and drama about other employees. Completely unprofessional.

Antonio L.,"Anaheim, CA",553,552,825,3.0,3/27/2016,"Typical mall parking, so depending on what time of day it is will determine how easy it will be to find parking.  We were lucky to have a friend in the party to regularly use their app and put in our name. We arrived, and our table was ready within 10 minutes. Definitely will download the app! We came for dessert, after visiting some food trucks down the street. We went for the pizookie of course. But my friends wanted to try some other fun desserts. Well, I went for the cookies and cream pizookie, cause I don't recall ever tasting it. It was pretty much a chocolate cookie with cookies and cream whipped cream. Wasn't anything exciting for me. Definitely would go back to either the white chocolate chip macadamia or chocolate chip next time. I wanted a little alcohol and went with the watermelon basil margarita. Bad choice. It did not mix well with the cookie. It was way too sweet and had too big of a kick. Both items I wouldn't go back to again here.  My friends went with the sampler and I tried the monkey bread and that was so much better. They also ordered the baked beignet which was covered with strawberries, it was so light and delicious. Another win for that! Unfortunately my dessert choices were far from delectable. But my friends choices balanced it out the loses and I give them a neutral rating for desserts here.  Our server Chase was pretty cool. Very attentive at first. We arrived an hour before the end of his shift. We received our check, divided up the check, and waited for his return. We hanged across the patio and there he was just sitting there. Another server came by to finally pickup the check.

I was quoted that the wait time would be 35 minutes.  Obviously, that was not the case. My party repeatedly made attempts to check in and find out how much longer till we'd be seated. The first time we were told 10-15 more minutes. Then, after 20 minutes, we returned and they said they were cleaning our table. After 10 minutes, we checked back in on our table and they said that they still needed to clean it, which they had said 10 minutes prior (why had they not started cleaning it earlier). Finally, they began to clean our table.  Nonetheless, we ended up waiting over an hour and 15 minutes to be seated.

Rick L.,"Brea, CA",10,288,594,2.0,3/13/2015,"Began at happy hour with family. Good time. While reviewing menu found out that the ""hand tossed"" pizza is no longer an option.  We love the deep dish but like to mix it up with hand tossed pie occasionally. The new gimmic is ""tavern cut"" pizzas which are nothing  more than a longer flat bread pizza (basically an appetizer) that doesn't fit on the pizza table rack. Our pizza wasn't cut so we had to try and cut it on the round rack with the long narrow pizza. It was a mess and all fell apart.  My first thought is they introduced this pie to cut back on dough which would add up due to the 160+ restaurants. The toppings were ok. I had a chicken pie with green chili etc. the pizza was too much work, sloppy and disappointing. Too bad because we like BJ's and most of their food. The bartenders were good and friendly until I found my bill inaccurate. Granted it was .60 off but it doesn't matter. Especially when the bartender girl told me it was mixed with someone else's bill!! What?? How much more was incorrect on this bill? I didn't check, i just wanted to leave. The bartender got pissy with me and shrugged off that it is only $.60. That is not the point young lady.  Maybe when she is my age, those $.60 mistakes will add up to a nice chunk of change. I have found other restaurants charging misleading costs that are no longer in business ( Inka Trails, Claremont). They were down right crooked.

They couldn't  take 2 minutes to check on my reservation?  Or at least they could have asked for my name and number to call me back.  At which point a simple message on my answering service would have done the trick.

Maria N.,"Whittier, CA",3,14,2,1.0,7/31/2017,"We are fans of BJ's and have been to this location in the past but they have lost our business after this last visit. We were there on a Monday at 1pm and it was not crowded but the service and food were both so disappointing. Our drinks came to us warm with very little ice and only one person was offered a refill. My daughter and I were brought salads with literally no dressing. We had to wait 10 minutes before we could find someone to ask for sides of dressing and then he still never brought any. The lettuce was wilted and awful looking. My mom has special dietary concerns so we asked for a plain baked potato but got  a tiny over-cooked rock. We tried to order her green beans (that were on the menu) but they didn't have any so we ordered a side of fruit. The side of fruit was RIDICULOUS. A teeny tiny little bowl that was half full no less! Like 3 bites of fruit... I thought it had to be a kids menu thing but no! Here's a tip- double or triple the price and make it a regular sized serving of fruit! Good lord! We also ordered the poké (we get it every time) and there were three little tiny cubes of avacado on the plate.. not even a full slice! If I hadn't eaten this there before I wouldn't have even known they were screwing us. So look, if you have a restaurant and want people to eat there, you actually have to serve a decently prepared, proper amount of food. ALSO- the table next to us? Those poor guys waited 45 dang minutes and all they ordered was a pazookie! (And their drinks had no ice either) So if you are a BJ's fan, seriously avoid this location.

We then ordered desserts and came out in 10 mins... Best hour we had. Great place for family and adults.

Kelli S.,"Honolulu, HI",1902,1170,9782,5.0,11/12/2014,"When I was going to school in the area, this BJ's was my go-to location because it was the closest one to me. Even though I no longer am in the Brea area on the regular basis, this is still one of my favorite locations. Though I have experienced long-ish wait times in the past and the restaurant is noisy, the quality of my food has always been really good. And--contrary to other locations--this location always does a stellar job with my ""Gourmet Mac and Cheese."" Here's what I would recommend when it comes to BJ's. Note: This review is primarily Pizookie-based because I always get one from here! ""Gourmet Mac and Cheese"": Sometimes I just get this mac and cheese dish as an entrée. When I got it from this Brea BJ's, it was extremely cheesy and didn't disappoint. I ordered it once in the restaurant and once for take-out, but it tasted so much better when I dined in. This mac and cheese dish features Rotini pasta with three cheeses, chipotle and garlic, and it's topped with smoked bacon bits and seasoned bread crumbs. It also comes with two, crispy pieces of garlic bread, which are perfect for dipping. I love the cheesy concoction, and I can definitely taste the garlic seasoning. The bacon bits add the perfect crunch, and the seasoned breadcrumbs also add welcomed taste and texture. I love dipping my garlic bread into the mac and cheese and spreading some of the gooey, cheesy mixture on top. Some locations don't have this dish on the small bites menu anymore, but when I last went to this location in May 2014, they still had it. I really hope they don't take it off more of the menus!   ""BJ's Peanut Butter S'mores"": I have to admit, I was a bit doubtful of this ""S'Mores"" Pizookie because I don't like lots of marshmallow ... in any of my desserts. But I was pleasantly surprised and delighted with BJ's take on the classic campfire treat because THIS version featured a layer of creamy peanut butter. That's right--the BJ's twist features a Ghirardelli triple chocolate cookie (one of my favorites because it's super chocolaty) topped with a peanut butter layer and completed with marshmallow fluff that's baked to a golden finish and vanilla bean ice cream. I thought the marshmallow layer would be overwhelming and too much for me to handle, but I was wrong. I rather enjoyed the toasted marshmallow layer and was able to pair it nicely with the rich, chocolate cookie and rapidly melting ice cream. I felt that the vanilla ice cream melted quicker than usual while I was enjoying this treat, but probably because of the added heat from the torched marshmallow fluff. I very much enjoyed this ""S'Mores"" Pizookie and hope it won't leave the menu anytime soon. The peanut butter layer truly revolutionizes this treat and makes a world of difference. I think the only thing that would make this dessert even better is if graham cracker crumbs were used somehow, maybe to sprinkle the top of the Pizookie.   ""Pizookie Trio"": This dessert option is great for sharing, especially if you're torn between several different Pizookies. These mini Pizookies (definitely smaller than the original; probably half the size or smaller than a regular-sized Pizookie) come with one scoop of ice cream each (your choice of flavor). You can choose one of the designated Pizookies from the menu; when I got this dish, I opted for ""Cookies 'n Cream,"" ""Triple Chocolate Made with Ghirardelli"" and ""Peanut Butter."" It was a hard decision, as I like the original ""Chocolate Chunk"" Pizookie as well, but I was completely satisfied with the different varieties. I shared this decadent dessert with my boyfriend, and we actually demolished most of it, as the mini Pizookies were definitely smaller (and so were the ice cream scoops). Would definitely recommend this if you're torn between two different Pizookies (and the problem can't be solved by getting half of one flavor and half of another in the same dish). ""Triple Chocolate Pizookie Made with Ghirardelli"": This Pizookie option is a great choice for extreme chocoholics. It features a rich chocolate cookie made with chunks of Ghirardelli chocolate, and it's topped off with two scoops of double chocolate ice cream, Ghirardelli chocolate chips and a Ghirardelli SQUARES dark chocolate. Yum! This dessert is definitely not for the faint of heart. Because I have an extreme sweet tooth, I ordered this Pizookie for myself once--the boyfriend insisted on getting a ""Salted Caramel Pizookie"" all to himself--and I was able to finish all of mine. I loved the fudgy, chocolaty cookie paired with the chocolate ice cream, and the chocolate chips added a decadent crunch to the mix. And, of course, the Ghirardelli dark chocolate SQUARES just put the perfect finishing touch on the sinfully sweet treat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=160

Steffy M.,"Yorba Linda, CA",312,2,,1.0,11/26/2016,"Made a yelp specifically to complain about this place. I have gotten terrible service on several acccounts. I love BJ's, the food and atmosphere is great.  But the Brea BJ's puts all of them to shame.  In the past year I have gone to the BJ's maybe 5-6 times, and every single time I have gotten terrible service.  The first time, I ordered a MINI pizooki and it took an hour. Really??? Furthermore, the waiter was no where to be seen the entire time.  I myself, who is also a waiter at a restuarant, know how difficult it can be at times so I let it go.  The second time I came was with my boyfriend and his family for his birthday.  We ordered a large pizza and it took an hour to come out. I understand pizza takes a long time to cook, but once it came out we found a HUGE strand of hair in the sauce.  When we told the server, she awkwardly walked away (without taking the nasty pizza) and called her manager to come over. The manager asked if we wanted another pizza, but at this time we weren't hungry because everyone had already ate their food except for the people who wanted the pizza. Another time I came, the server was NO WHERE TO BE FOUND.  We all finished our waters & had nothing to drink once the food came out because he never came back to refill our cups.  On another account, the server kept bringing waters out for us.  There were 5 people in my party, and at the end of the night there were 16 glasses. No, I am not making this up.  And they were ALL full, none of us were drinking that much water.  Why the server thought it would be smart to keep bringing out waters, I don't know. (We're in a drought- come one!) The final straw was yesterday.  I came in with a party of 8, and everything was fine until it was time to pay the check.  The server never came by to take the check, and we just sat at the table for about 30 minutes waiting for him to come back.  They also over estimate their wait times by way too much.   All in all, the food is good, but the service here is TERRIBLE.  If you're in the area, just go to the Cheesecake factory, it's right across from BJ's.   If you want good and quick service, don't come here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=160

I asked him for two sides of sour cream with my potato skins and he confirmed. When I got home, there were two sides of ranch and a side of this disgusting yellow sauce that tasted like horseradish. I've had the potato skins here before and they don't even come with that sauce. It says on the menu SOUR CREAM and ranch. It's not rocket science people.

They only had 4 fans and there were no extra blowers whatsoever. All guests were sweating like crazy.  The food was decent - pizza and pasta. However the first batch of spaghetti was very pale. The server didn't mix it properly and whatever sauce was there was extremely minimal. I don't know why they don't mix it themselves because for the second batch, there was sufficient sauce.

Kimberly S.,"Long Beach, CA",54,9,17,2.0,12/22/2016,"This review is mainly based on service. It is Thursday night, 8:40pm and the restaurant is not too busy. We check in at the front as ask for a table 2. The girl said give me five minutes so we said ok and continued to stand there and wait. After a few minutes we sat down and a party of 3 came in after us. 10 minutes pass by, the party of 3 is sat. So my husband goes up again and asks when we can be seated, the girl replies with ""for how many?"" Clearly having forgot that we were there and never took our name.  A few minutes later we are seated, just about 9pm when we ordered. We just wanted a relatively simple and quick dinner so we ordered a Santa Fe salad and portobello fries as an appetizer with a peach tea and a sparkling water.  Our appetizer came to the table at 9:24. It took about 10 minutes after we finished eating the appetizer (had it cleared from the table also) until the salad came out.  The waiter was attentive with our drink refills by coming and asking when our drink was low, but it took so long for the refills to come out. We were so thirsty!  We finish the salad and order dessert. One pazookie. I think after 15 minutes he noticed we were slumped over in our seats just tired of waiting, (cause at this point it was nearly 10pm) so he came over and said let me check on the pazookie and also said I'll get you a refill as well.  Finally the pazookie came out around 10:10. Delivered by someone else who wasn't our waiter. Still no refill in sight. We finish the pazookie and he comes back and says he will get the check (and the refill) which at this point I didn't even want anymore. Finally, done with the check and left the restaurant at 10:30! We arrived at 8:40.... 2 hours of our night for an appetizer, SALAD and a fricken pazookie.  Definitely not going to eat at bjs again if it's a night we have things to do and take care of. I understand that amount of time being spent dining if we had a large group or ordered a lot, but we didn't. Just two people and the restaurant wasn't busy at all.

It's an incredibly strange combination but I'll be damned if didn't work. The burger was nicely cooked and you could taste the bacon underneath. But really the proceedings were dominated by the chili verde covering everything. Delicious. Had I been sloshed the night before this would have been a gift from heaven but as is, it was a damn tasty meal. The kiddo got the KRAFT mac and cheese again so no comment there.

He was on his way to check on me and saw me seated!  10 minutes!!  As I look around I am the only single woman in the restaurant....I even received a group hug from two of the waitresses when I was seated since I was road weary. It was Happy Hour and our destination was 45 minutes away so we ordered appetizers: Chips and dip (guacamole)....the chips gleaned with grease, the dip was dark with wilted garnishes.   I got the dry ribs with saturated ribs with a side of finely chopped dry vegetables saturated in dressing . My husband got the avocado egg rolls which were fresh and delicious. Sadly the food preparation was poor with a distasteful appearance. Very different than Las Vegas!  So disappointed..... My husband spoke with the Manager that offered an indifference with no response!   Our waitress was a delight, courteous, and attentive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=60

Haywood J.,"Claremont, CA",2,20,5,1.0,10/16/2016,"Let's say I'm a generous person and every restaurant starts out with five stars, and it's up to them to lose them. Here's how BJ's lost theirs: Cold spinach and artichoke dip: minus one half star Had to ask more than once for both lemonade and tabasco sauce: minus one half star. Had to send incredibly undercooked burger (practically raw) that was ordered medium rare back to the kitchen: minus one star. Had to send second slightly less undercooked burger that was ordered medium rare that the manger brought us personally (you would probably call this one very rare) back to the kitchen: minus one star.  Get third burger, which is sort of properly cooked, and accept that from the manager, only to realize a few minutes later that the bacon on this particular burger was so undercooked that no reasonable human being would eat it: minus one star.  Not having the burger that took three tries for them to not get right taken off of your bill: $12.50. Getting to eat cold chili to go with your bacon-less burger while all of your companions have finished eating: priceless.

Richard D.,"La Habra, CA",0,25,,3.0,6/6/2017,"Years ago when this was a Magnolia's Peach, we'd come often, but after it became BJ's and was remodeled inside, not as often. The reason is the noise. I'm a senior, and have difficulty hearing and the noise in this place makes for a lonely meal, as I cannot hear anything said at our table due to the background noise. When it was Magnolia's Peach, there was carpeting throughout and it was much, much quieter. That's ancient history!,  BJ'd is too noisy for old folks like me. Before we sat down, I checked on the outside dining and discovered it was quiet, and the gas space heaters in the top of the awnings kept the area warm and cozy. (It was overcast and typical June gloom weather outside with a definite chill in the air but inside the tentlike enclosure, it was fine AND QUIET.) The food was good. We had Ribs, Chicken Club Sandwich, Spaghetti & Meatballs and a Mediterranean deep dish pizza. The wife had a Top Shelf Margarita on the rocks which was very good. The rest of us had soft drinks.  The dinner was topped off with Pizookie.  The best part was our table server, Judy C (#195). She is a star. We loved the way she treated us like family and took care of our every need. The lemonade, Iced tea and Sierra mist drinks were kept topped off without asking, and in a timely manner. Couldn't be happier with Judy's attitude and great service.  (Note to manager: Judy is a keeper - take good care of her.) For the record: Scoring as follows - noise level 1 star, food 3-1/2 stars, Service 5 stars!!!

Raymond L.,"Orange County, CA",361,997,3699,3.0,10/31/2015,"It was a Friday afternoon, and Raymond saw the perilous path in front of him. Irvine to the 57 to the IE? Oh dear. I had left a little earlier than usual, around 4pm, heading out of Irvine. Looking at the traffic report, I knew I wasn't gonna be able to make it home without going crazy and yelling at all the stopped cars. Texting mi amiga Bonnie, asking if I should stop for Happy Hour or should I go, she said Happy hour! And so I stopped in Brea (it had already taken an hour to get to Brea- usual 35 mins) and wanted to do Yard House. Bonnie couldn't make it til 6 so I quickly switched to BJs since their Happy Hour is M-F 3-7pm. Going at 6, there was a line for parties that were more than 3, but since we were only a party of two, we quickly got a seat. Their happy hour is on their beers, cocktails and wines. They also have 50% mini deep dish pizzas and $2 off shareable/handcrafted appetizers.  Barefoot White Wine- Flavors of green apples and peaches with a creamy mouthfeel. Not really too much of a fan of this, because the fruitiness of the drink wasn't as strong as I had hoped for it to be. It was light and alcohol was more of a presence. Yes, that's the case, but it's my personal alcohol taste :P If you like more alcohol, go ahead and try it ($6.25/glass) BJs mini deep dish pizza- $11.50 reg. Totally not worth at that price. I think 1/2 price is a more reasonable price. 6"" pizza. It was indeed deep dish and you could taste the crunch. Plus so much more crust :3 There was a lot of cheese and a decent amount of mushrooms and toppings on there. The only thing would be that it is sooo not worth the regular price. You want wings? They got wings. They aren't dry either and they are marinated pretty well. Tangyyyyyyy. You got celery and ranch on the side as well :)  BJs is loud and boomin and will have tons of people here throughout the day- come here for Happy Hour and enjoy their beers and appetizers! :D No pictures included because  a) it was really dark- they dimmed lights around 620pm b) Phone was at like 7% battery c) Was too tired.

The manager apologized and gave us an appetizer on the house (by then, we were starving after all that waiting) and she was really courteous about it. Everything else was good, but the long wait did alter our experience. We were tired, hungry, and a little grouchy after waiting for so long. I know it wasn't the whole staff's fault.

Delivery time: fast! and on time, but the driver made us go to the car, not attempt to come to our apartment, granted it is gated.. The error: incorrect wings (they brought spicy buffalo... which the kids cannot eat, thats why we ordered BBQ), missing soda (probably the easiest item to bring), and soggy eggrolls. The offered solution: to leave and bring back the soda Xs 2. The wait: 45 minutes later my brother and his kids were still waiting, it was movie night and we didnt want to be interrupted with the delivery of soda. we called the restaurant and the delivery person was still there getting ready to leave for another delivery and will drop the soda off after.  We said forget it, take off the soda, and the wings, and the delivery fee...

I almost always order a pizza when I come here and that decision has always served me well , you can't really mess up a pizza right ? Occasionally, when I'm really hungry and I'm with a larger group of people we will all order a variety of appetizers and share them amongst ourselves and when those occasions occur almost all of us are always happy with our menu choices. I will say that though they do not do it often I am a big fan of their promotions. I love it when they offer 2 salads or soups, 1 pizza and one dessert for $20. At that price you can't go wrong, but like I said before, it does not happen often and most of the times when I've asked waiters or waitresses in the past about it, they didn't seem very happy  that I knew about that promotion as its not very publicly advertised.

I've been coming here since 2007 and I will still be going back :) Pros:  -They have pretty good happy hour. -Great place to come grab a bite to eat/ catch up with friends.  -They have a pretty good selection of food variety (Even have some gluten free options.)  -They have great customer service -They have a good selection of alcohol. My personal favorite is their Berry Burst Cider #I'llHaveAnotherOne Cons:  -Service can be a little on the slower side with big parties.  -Wait time can be longer than what they tell you. (I had a reservation (for a big party) and we still ended up waiting a good amount of time before we were seated )  -Big Parties= 1 big check, they don't split the bill.  (However, They did do it for me one time when I went with 16 of my friends, our server was actually amazing! She definitely got a good tip.)  TIP: If you have a big party, make a reservation.  If you are going to decorate the table with anything (Ie: Bridal shower, Birthday etc.) Get there earlier and make sure to talk to the manager on which table they're giving you so there's no miscommunication.  ( I went in for my reservation for 25 on one occasion.The Server/Hotess showed me my table, So I set up with some table decor/gifts, only to have their manager tell me I was actually at a different table..so I had to move to another table at the other Patio (They have two Patios)..It was inconvenient to say the least.But the rest of the service was good.)

Caesar Salad + Grilled Chicken (the regular dinner size) [Take-Out] Lunch Special Grilled Chicken Pasta + Caesar Salad Pizzookie (half White Chocolate Macademia + half Chocolate Chip) Personal Sized BJ's Favorite Tastes: Grilled Chicken Pasta was mediocre. It lacked that punch of flavor; you only don't get thin strips of chicken anymore. The cut is larger than usual, probably to mask just how little you actually get now. The lettuce in the salad was lackluster too; it didn't have the crunch of freshness. The to-go orders were an utter disappointment. 1. The amount of pasta in the to-go container is SMALL; my brother even asked me if this was my leftover! Either give more pasta or downsize your to-go box (former, of course, is preferred)! 2. The pizzookie had a gaping gap in the middle of the two flavors. It did not look appetizing at all. Price: Not worth what you actually get. All of the above was already $60 (that's a lot granted we got 3 lunch special dishes). Service: Waiters weren't as attentive. It took awhile to flag them down and get our bill and change.

Now on to the HH food we got.  Since they have items for $4, $5 and $6 dollars it appears at first glance to be a great deal!  That is until you receive your food and realize these portions have been cut in half or more.  So basically you pay less, and you get a lot less.  Not sure how that is a deal then?   This place used to be decent, but after this experience I'll just drive down the street to Taps ...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=180

Elisa Y.,"Rowland Heights, CA",77,71,8,3.0,8/3/2014,"After a 20 minute wait, we were seated. We started off with a waitress who asked what we wanted to drink and we placed our order. Then everything went down hill from there She had to go on her break so she brought a waiter who would be taking over. We placed our order of drinks and appetizers. It took him forever to bring our drinks. They actually came with our appetizers. When he brought the appetizers, we didn't even have any silverware so we asked him  to bring us some. He brought us some plates but they were dirty so we asked for some new ones. He forgot about it and we had to ask another waiter. By the time they brought us the silverware and the plates, we pretty much finished eating the appetizers with our fingers because it took forever.   The fried calamari wasn't as great because more than half was tentacles which I wasn't too pleased with.  We asked for refills on our drinks on several occasions and it took FOREVER as well.  We finally ordered our food. The food came, the server brought our pizza but they never brought us the pizza stand so he just placed it flat on the table, so I had to ask for the pizza stand. Isn't it common sense to bring a pizza stand before a pizza is brought out?  Once they brought the pizza stand we attempted to grab slices but the pizza wasn't even cut right. We were standing there cutting and tearing the pizza into pieces from the pan.  Our waiter came to check on us probably like once after that. On top of that when he finally brought us refills, he spilt some of the drink on my husband but failed to even acknowledge it or apologize it.

Upon ordering, I added a wedge salad which the waiter said would be brought right away.  After 10 minutes I asked where my salad was and he went to get it.  Wedge it was not; it looked like lettuce sloppily thrown on a plate with dressing poured over it sparingly. While I was eating my dinner and salad, (dinner came a few minutes after the salad) the waiter asks if I wanted another beer.  I said yes and the waiter had to be remind again 10 minutes later where was my order.

This location is across from the Brea Mall and close to Cheesecake Factory. I usually get the Blackened Chicken Pizza. The combination of cheese, alfredo sauce, and corn somehow blend well together. The texture of the pizza was soft and fluffy. I know it's not the real deal in terms of deep dish but it was pretty good. I've also had the BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich. This was a huge sandwich! The Pulled Pork was tender and had lots of flavor. The sauce was made up of smoky BBQ ranch sauce and BJ's Jeremiah Red Ale. The crispy onion rings in the sandwich were great. The crispy thin fries that came with the sandwich were pretty good. They were crispy and not overly salty. The coleslaw here was also good!   I also like getting BJ's Famous Pizookie. The cookie is fresh and hot and topped with two scoops of vanilla bean ice cream makes it perfect.  The service here usually has been great! The servers are very attentive. The seating arrangement is interesting They have U-shaped booths that face booths on the opposite side. Meaning that if I were to sit in a U-shaped booth, I'd be potentially staring at people dining in the booths on the other side.

But over the last year or so I have found that the place is falling apart (in terms of service/food/etc, not structurally). The food has become bland, under cooked at times, but yet takes forever to get - regardless to how slow or busy it is. Customer service has been suffering too. The ladies (and occasionally dudes) at the front greet people when they come to the podium to reserve a table. And as of late, that's about the best customers get. Many of the waitresses/waiters have extremely fake attitudes, they are not very accommodating, don't know the menu, and don't really seem to care about their jobs. My last visit is a prime example of this upset. The waitress we had was slow to getting our order, got half of our orders wrong, and then disappeared for the majority of our meal. It wasn't a busy night, so I am not sure what lead her to ignore our table. None of the 6 people in my party were happy with the meal. Its too bad most of the good employees moved on and management cant replace them with equally ""skilled"" employees.

We the hostess (different) sat us, she just threw the menus on the table, said something around the lines of enjoy your dinner or they will be with you, and walked away before we were even sat.

Chris B.,"Brea, CA",54,110,33,3.0,5/25/2015,"Not what it used to be. I remember when this and the chain altogether was new on the scene, making a splash.  I was a huge fan unaware of any other place around home one could get what they called Deep Dish (mocking tone only because I visited Chicago for a dozen years, and that's a different animal altogether).  Initially, the pizza was a valiant effort, never as much cheese as this Midwesterner would like and would get while traveling, but still tasty, with a wonderfully ever-so-slightly burnt crust edge.  Just the right amount of oil, and lots of great tomatoes.  Ordering extra cheese has a moderate impact on the volume. Since that time, a couple things have happened, but it all boils down to the company's gotten too big for its britches and the bean counters have assumed control.  Service is slow (I've experienced this not only when dining there, but when I had a party there the space was way understaffed, so people were always waiting for something).  Wouldn't you sell more drinks and have happier people if you had a couple more servers making sure everyone who wanted something got it?

Jennifer M.,"Vallejo, CA",2,35,2,1.0,8/1/2014,"Horrible service.  We were seated out on patio where only two other tables had customers, our friendly server approached us before we had a chance to look at menu, so he offered us a couple of waters while we figured out what we wanted.  He came back quickly and we told our server we were STARVING.   We said we'd put in our dinner order before even looking at drinks or appetizers.  That was the last time our server inquired about us.  We waited and waited.  All the tables filled up eventually, we are just sitting there.  Others order were taken.  Appetizers and cocktails are out.  Even customers who had our same server had delivered food while we are still sitting with now empty water glasses.   At one point, I tried to get the server's attention and got the ""just a minute"" signal while he helped other tables.  Finally, I just asked out loud if we could get some bread or anything to eat ?   So, after finishing with the other table, he walked by sharing BJ's doesn't offer bread but we could order some little bread things from menu.  We are hungry waiting a very LONG time for food we ordered before BJ's got busy.    Meanwhile, a woman finally brought out food, but not quite as ordered. (we had a detailed conversation with the waiter when ordering how we eat everything spicy). So our waiter notices the plate is missing horseradish, while walking by, saying he'll get some.  We ask for steak sauce, hot sauce, or anything spicy, This as a fast request, since it didn't arrive as ordered.  He continues to another table, takes an order.  On the way back, I ask for extra salad dressing.  He disappearing inside again.  (So we waited for him to walk by, waited while he took an order, and then caught him walking by again.  The food is already cooling down. We wait, wait, wait, wait the food gets cold.  Cold steak and potatoes, not happening. We have nothing to drink either, (on a warm August evening), so we are thirsty and hungry.   Sitting there, I now have a headache so I tell my husband I am just going to find our server inside.  I physically am feeling bad and put a credit card on his tray saying, please just bring us the check. oh and to go containers.  When I find him, our bottled steak sauce and hot sauce is on his tray with the other table's drink orders and the extra dressing I ordered. Essentially, we waited for him to go to take an order, go to a busy Friday night bar and order drinks, wait for the drinks, go to the kitchen, place an order, get our sides, rather than just provide bottled condiments so we can eat while our food is hot.  This after our order was somehow missed without so much as an explanation, refill on empty water glasses, let alone double check if we wanted cocktails ourselves, now that we've had a chance to  look at menu and ""think about it.""   So now that we see the tray, we are really pissed.  He delivers all the cocktails and sets our condiments down across the room.  I get the condiments myself, I go inside and pick up to go containers, while he is running the credit card.  He responds to this stating he wasn't sure  if we wanted the food because we looked unhappy.  Really, what about this situation made him think we weren't HUNGRY and THIRSTY. I explained yes, we are very unhappy.  We are unhappy with the service. We are thirsty and ravenous..  I point to empty water glasses and said we have been ignored this entire time, no one has checked on us.  CRAZY that he didn't get it when I was pleading for bread or anything please. Then it sinks in, he starts saying sorry, sorry, sorry. Excessively. Here's the thing...the people sitting behind us, who arrived much later than we did, who hear him saying sorry while I am saying look, we just want to leave get snarky with us.  They say it is too bad we have to behave like this.  Really, you are sipping on drinks and getting service...walk in our shoes for an hour.  Hey, ""sorry"" might have worked the first or second time there was an oversight.  But courtesy doesn't explain why we have nothing to drink and can't even get bottled condiments in less than 15 minutes, that wasn't nice for us.   The couple that walked in saying they were so hungry has to wait for everyone's cocktails, order taking, and kitchen interaction before receiving a bottle of steak sauce?  We were courteous by choosing not to skip out on the bill, no one around to notice us use the outside exit.  Now, please...let us pay for our cold bland food.  At least we have bottled water in our vehicle to ""jug a lug"" and quench our thirst.   We can drive, fix a cocktail, microwave the food, and season it quicker than waiting for a bottle of A-1 sauce in this joint.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=260

We dined here for the second time a few days ago. It was pretty busy for a Saturday so had to wait around 25 minutes to get seated. The entryway was pretty packed with lots of people waiting to be seated. They had an ample amount of seating for waiting customers, but it still wasn't enough! They also have the takeout station/cash registers in the entryway next to the door, so that can cause some traffic as well. Interestingly enough I didn't see any customers picking up takeout in the 25 minutes that I was waiting there. They have some pretty interesting architecture here that I haven't seen at other locations. It's boredline castle-like with these big stone arches inside the restaurant. See my uploaded photos for reference. They also had pictures of half naked men in the womens' bathroom...weird? Haha. Service was pretty good! Our waiter was good, and had just the right amount of attentiveness but not overdoing it. For being as busy as they were, we didn't have to wait TOO long for our food to arrive.

After 10 minutes, no one has came to our table to serve us. i started getting irritated and my friend got up and went to the bartender and asked for a server. The Bartender had to walk around the whole bar area and the back to find the server for us.  Finally our server too our order. My friend ordered a moscow mule and asked for belvedere vodka instead. The server said, ""But it's an extra charge for belvedere."" My friend just replied, ""that's fine."" This bothered me because every time we order our moscow mule, our server would say, ""It'll be an extra charge, will that be okay."" .. So, I thought okay, maybe I'm grumpy because I'm hungry. Nope, we ordered pizza with everything on it and asked for thin crust and she said that it's not on happy hour. My friend then says, ""I don't care, I just want thin crust."" ... Really, BJ's? Not everyone is there to take advantage of happy hour which would be nice but this is the way we want our food and drinks, happy hour or not.

This one is specifically located inside the mall parking lot past Cheesecake Factory around the same area as Sears & Nordstroms. Parking is difficult depending on the day/night due to being in a busy mall parking lot, so if you find a spot, take it! Now onto the Restaurant. We had an extremely large party of over 25 people, but the staff certainly took care of us & really made sure we were okay across the board. Our main server wasn't too knowledgable about drinks other than the beers. I asked a question about a sangria & he was grasping for any type of lifeline to help him, as my friend interrupted & asked if they only had a blood orange flavor, which in fact they did at the time. The food however is just mediocre in my opinion. It had its highlights & lowlights. I was loved loved loved the Sriracha Brussle Sprouts, yum!! We ended up ordering two extra rounds, delicious, even if you're not a fan of Brussels. The pizza is just whatever, the toppings are what makes it. The traditional pan style is dry and you kinda have to dunk it in ranch to make it palatable despite the toppings which is a disappointment. Onto the Pizookie, well how can you go wrong with that? Par-baked cookie fresh out of the oven & ice cream, yeah its still as delicious as it used to be (I ordered the cookies & cream).  If you do have a big party like we did, tell folks to bring cash.

It's disappointing to even think that we got the service that we did because of the gratuity that's automatically included, or because our server just didn't care. Needless to say, their service could have been at least 1/2 as good as their food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=240
Jozie H.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,5,,1.0,6/4/2017,"I ordered take out today and was given a coupon on my email for a free appetizer if you spend a minimum of $9.95 food purchase. Our order was 2 kids meals which came out to $12.50, so we ordered avocado egg rolls for our free appetizer. We we got to the restaurant they did not want to honor our free appetizer because we did not get a entree of $9.95. The coupon, which is on their own website does not state an entree is required. It's just says a minimum of $9.95 food purchase. Which we did. The manger came out and proceeded to tell me he would not honor this coupon and I said yes you are it's not stated anywhere that we are required to purchase an entree. I asked the manager if he was going to fight this and he stormed off. Our food we guaranteed for 7:15 and it's now 7:45 and we have not gotten the changed back from our order and I already called once asking for our change.

She said she understood, but obviously she and/or the cook didn't....  For the record, rare does not mean medium. Medium is burnt, just as rare would be ""raw"" to those who want medium. There were several other minor issues, including being served a beer other than what I ordered.  The manager came by for a chat (not at my request), and I answered his inquiry of how things were.

Our server was a meek young girl who was probably way too inexperienced for a larger party, and at times we couldn't figure out where she'd gone; she would disappear for long stretches of time and it took way too long to get our check at the end of the night. Can't speak for anyone else's food but the BBQ chicken salad I split with someone was wilted and seemed as though it had been dressed and left to sit for an hour (kinda soggy).  However, I could overlook the salad if I was able to end the meal with a delicious warm cookie topped with ice cream but NO, despite the past success of every other pizookie I had ever eaten at another BJs, this one tasted like it was baked hours ago and sat on the counter, then topped with ice cream sent out to the table.  Super disappointing.   I'd stay away from this BJs in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=240

This place is good if you want something simple and just some decent American food. If you don't frequent this location much, be advised that it's located by the Brea mall but not in the mall.

Either my taste buds have changed or the cooking has because the amazing deep dish pizza I remembered was salty -- even for him which is saying a lot. The wedge salad was okay but he was disappointed that the bacon was burnt.  The best part was the chocolate chip pizookie that we shared as a dessert. The chocolate was still melty and the ice cream was good. But by the end of the pizookie it was turning hard and became difficult to scrape from the pan. Wonder whether they all turn out like this or whether it was just ours? Overall the server was nice but the furniture was dirty (mystery hardened goop on my arm rest kept me from using the right side of the chair) which made us wonder whether the kitchen was clean and we can get better quality pizza closer to home with fresh ingredients for less money so we think maybe this location is just in business because people know the chain and because it's in a mall parking lot which generates a lot of business.

My bf and I were really hungry, so we went straight to ordering the calamari when our server barely got to us to ask for our drinks. lol!  Ordered the white peach margarita (get it on the rocks instead of slush = more alcohol!! *wink) Boyyy it was strong! It comes with frozen peaches too, which I enjoyed after finishing my drink. A must try! I love calamari, and BJ's calamari never disappoints! It was actually served out really fast, so that got me super excited. What I liked about it the most is that it  stays crispy no matter how long it has been. I remember I snuck in a last piece even after our main meal, and it still had a crunch to it! (a plus!) Also, I love calamari when it's served with the squid legs -- this choice was definitely a win! We also ordered the Spicy Pig tavern cut pizza. Yummy! It comes with pieces of jalapeno, so be careful because it gets spicy! I love spicy food and the fact that this pizza comes with pineapples (love!!) was definitely a good choice! Our server was super patient and was very nice -- even though it was obvious that we just wanted to place our order right away. lol If it wasn't for the self-seating bar area, then we would've left.

MIchelle R.,"Long Beach, CA",25,19,30,1.0,4/5/2017,"This review is solely based on my take-out curbside, customer service and food quality experience.  I ordered a large pizza and pazookie through the mobile app. First, they allow you order a half and half of their speciality pizzas but they dont actually offer all of their speciality pizzas. I wanted to order half spicy Hawaiian chicken and half sweet pig. You cannot do this online or the mobile app. You have to order it al a cart. The pizza should have been just under 19.00 but soon blossomed to 32.00 for the exact pizza toppings on this particular half and half combo. I edited the order and just gave up my dream of this girl having my favorite in-store favorite not instore. Le sigh.....  The bugger was I called at 6:50pm to see if I could pick my order up 5 to 10 mintues earlier than my ticket time of 7:30pm. I was put on hold for almost  15mins! Needless to  when someone finally picked up I was in the parking lot. I just told them that I would go inside to see about picking out my order. Their take out personnel  try to  give me another person's order that was the complete opposite of my order because potato skins and a Pizookie don't exactly like a large pizza and a Pizookie. I would advise they would check on my order and proceeded to wait there until after 7:30 before I got it. After getting my order walking back out to the car for curbside takeout service I realized that he actually didn't even pack the ranch that I've specifically requested on the online order and had to walk back in to get it. Now it might not be a big deal, but at this point  I'm now hangry and tired from work and just want to go home.  Okay, leave  a girl without their Ranch they asked for.  Needless to say the ordering system and take out curbside service needs to be altered and for their communication needs to be addressed..... leaving a person on hold for that long, knowing still waited you could not even offer me a water while I waited inside parked on the curbside spot........very dissapointed to even say thr pizza was not even hot all the eat through and was dough-y.

Our server got our drink order and also the desert which of course we ordered the pizookie red velvet style. My first time getting it in that flavor. You could taste the white chocolate in it as well. Pretty good mix with the ice cream on top. Liked it ! The only thing I didn't like was our alcoholic drinks. We ordered mojito lights but they tasted soo sweet it wasn't as good as other places. I wasn't expecting it to be amazing but it was pretty terrible. I would suggest just ordering desserts and no drinks. Maybe a beer??,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=300
Atis S.,"Brea, CA",14,20,32,3.0,11/3/2015,"Called in to order BBQ chicken pizza for the takeout. The employee said the total was $20 something. (I'm fully aware it's pricey) When I picked up it turned out it's $28 in total so I said nothing and left but then it'd bother me if I stay quiet so I went back and told him off that he said it's $20 on the phone and he apologized so I'm okay with that. But when I got home, it turned out it's not the pizza I ordered. He even asked me twice to repeat an order for him.  Despite that, the pizza was great.

Erik J.,"Corona, CA",10,52,1,2.0,11/12/2014,"I've been to this location before and am familiar with the food and atmosphere. My friends and family went here for my birthday on 10/27. We had a larger party but were able to be seated almost immediately. However, after that, the service was much less stellar. My wife and I were there with our young son and some friends for my birthday dinner. When service is slow, it's magnified when you have a small child. In this case, service was sporadic at best. It took some time for even our drinks to come out (our son's milk included). Drink refills were also troublesome. My wife and I ordered a medium pizza to split between the three of us. When it came out, the crust was soggy and undercooked (even for a deep dish pizza). It had to be taken back to spend extra time in the oven. This caused my son to become more upset as we literally had to take the food away from him and he was hungry (as were my wife and I by that point). By the time dinner was served I was at wit's end between my son's temperament (dour, but almost understandable given how long we had been there overall by that point) and the service. We ended up leaving our friends as soon as we could get the check, which was lamentable since we were there to celebrate my birthday. As we left it didn't seem like there were many people waiting to be seated, so it was harder for me to ascertain how busy the place actually was (and therefor explain the slow service), since I was mostly focused on getting my son home at that point. Overall, the place is passable at best on most nights, but on busier nights the service can crawl. The venue has bad acoustics and it can get rather loud, especially if there are sporting events being turned up on the TVs throughout the venue. It definitely has more of a loud sports bar appeal than a family restaurant. It's a shame. I love their beer and menu, but I don't think it's enough to warrant another visit for a while at least.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=300
Vi V.,"Orange County, CA",281,760,3358,3.0,8/21/2012,"I've been to this particular BJ's a couple of times already and everything is just okay. We came almost right when it opened so no wait for us. What we got: BJ's P.M. Porter ($3.50): so my BF was tempted to get this after seeing ""Dark Caramel and Chocolate""...I had a sip and bleh! He didn't like it either...but I mean if you like dark ale... Southern Fried Chicken ($6): yum! it was a fried chicken steak on top of mashed potatoes and surrounded by corn and roasted red peppers. I'm not a mashed potatoes kind of person, but I wanted the chicken steak...but the mashed potatoes were pretty good, it was creamy and smooth. The chicken wasn't try and it had a nice crunch to it. As for the corn, you can't really mess up corn... Enlightened Barbacoa Tacos ($6): comes with black beans as well. I had a bite of a taco and it was pretty good, but not something I or my BF would get again. The bean comes with a couple of tortilla chips and the BF said it was pretty good. Peanut Butter, Red Velvet, & White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Pizookie Trio ($9): my BF and I couldn't decide on one pizookie so why not get 3! Peanut butter was his and he really liked it and I took a bite of it and it was very peanut butter-y. Red velvet was mine and it was delicious! It had cream cheese bits in it. I've had a couple red velvet cookies before, but this is definitely one of the better tasting ones. The white chocolate macadamia nut was for both of us to share and by then I was stuffed. I had a bite, but there was nothing special about it. Definitely get the red velvet pizookie! Service: It has always been the same every time I come. It was just okay.

Then they tell us they can't split the bill when we all knew they could.

I ordered fettuccine chicken Alfredo and when it arrived it was barely Luke warm. I asked if they could hear it up. It came back mildly warmer and also half the size it originally was. The meal was also supposed to come with dinner bread which was missing. At the same time it took my friend at least 10 minutes just to get some ranch.

She, I and her boyfriend decided to go out for dinner, and decided on BJs because it has always been a favorite. The place was packed, we waited about fifteen minutes for a table. No problem, it's the holidays, that's expected.  Sat, waited a while, finally got our drink order in. Waited and waited, drinks arrived at a snail's pace. Again, busy probably, excused because we were talking and not caring so much.  Finally got our orders in, a lot of the time we had to flag down our waitress or another one that passed by. All the staff was friendly and efficient, that wasn't the issue.  We ordered a pizookie before the meal. We were excited to try it, after one spoonful we found a hair in it! We told the waitress, manager came back with a pizookie. They just didn't charge for the hair one but charged for another one despite this disgusting mistake. Fine.  Next, our meals arrived. My sister's plate looked pathetic. The vegetables were all overcooked and the fish was like a balloon, overcooked as well. The plate looked like it came from a back refrigerator. She didn't send it back because it already took a lifetime to get and she was afraid the fish would then be undercooked instead so she ate it anyway.  The food was bad, the service wasn't on point.

She barked ""how many"" at me, and then took my name, then pointed and said ""over there."" The next girl that took us to our seats didn't have her shoes on all the way. I can't get over how gross and icky that is. Put your shoes on, get better ones... Something. Please don't make me look at your socks with holes... We came in at 9:15, ordered two Sierra mists and a salted Carmel pizookie. The only thing that didn't let us down was the pizookie and the last manager we talked to. Sierra mist was all carbonation, which I understand happens... Change the syrup, let it run, fill a glass, taste it (then.. If it's okay...), fill guests glass and return to the table. Do not let a carbonated/syrup mess go back to the guest. This is what happened to us. So we tell the waitress. With a scoff and eyeroll the waitress brought a new one... And they took 15 minutes to remove one Sierra Mist off the bill at the end. Their points program is deceiving- there's ""current"" points and ""lifetime"" points. Apparently somewhere along the line was a free pizookie that I never asked for/redeemed but had enough points for so they removed it from our ""current"" total.... So I was pretty peeved, waitress tells me how the program works, which I already understood. Her condescension was not what I needed in order to make the situation better.  The manager came over and heard about the dining event we had and removed the pizookie. So, we were out the door for $5.  I don't think we are going to let ourselves fall into this trap again.

I was really disappointed. I ordered the Hawaiian mahi-mahi, I complained about my food being bland and in the menu it says that it comes with soy ginger sauce but there was no sign of it at all in my plate so the waiter said ""oh! They must've not put enough so I'll just get you more sauce."" I told him that it didn't even taste any soy ginger sauce in the first place. OMG! The rice that comes with it was too mushy. It wasn't good at all. He asked if I wanted anything else but I told him I'm okay, I don't wanna wait another 20 mins  plus my bf is done eating his dry steak. We didn't make a complain for that coz he was hungry. We wanted some pizookie but our waiter took forever! He keeps passing by. I can see he was getting kinda busy but our table was in the middle and he couldn't even stop for like 3 seconds. So we just didn't order any. I was really sad and disappointed.

Gave us dirty menus that were sticky w juice & the pages sticking together. He walked by a few times but didn't pick up our empty plates but did remember to drop off the check and still leave our plates on the table.  We paid, tipped, & left.  I called about 20 minutes later because my friend forgot his hat. The hostess checked and said she had the hat there. i told her i would pick it up in the morning. Upon arriving to the restaurant the hostesses that day seemed so lost & confused. I felt like i was speaking w teenage girls giggling and twirling their hair. They didnt have the hat. They kept asking me ""what was the host's name from that night? and i look at their shirts & i reply, ""none of you have name  tags how am i supposed to know anyones name?  i asked to speak to the Manager. Nancy was her name. Very poor customer service. Made me wait about 10 minutes before she stepped out of the back. Didnt have a manager persona, maybe got the title by putting in her years. Definitely needs training if she is to hold this title.  i spoke to her about the incident. How an employee told me it was physically there and now its missing. I told her a hat doesnt just walk away on its own. Suggesting if its stolen it must be an internal issue. She replied ""Maybe a customer took it while we had it up here on the counter"" & i said ""or maybe it was an employee"" thats where she couldnt control herself. And replied ""our employees do not steal"" (i really liked how she said that without being sure. not everyone follows the policy.) then she said ""we keep our lost & found for 2 weeks, but we are not responsible if it goes missing"" ... Ive been in retail for years, this Manager Nancy either needs a LOT of training or a demotion. This postion should go to someone who knws how to handle this situation better. What i didnt appreciate is how she was quick to accuse a BJ's customer of stealing this brand new hat but how an employee would ""NEVER"" do such a thing.   And of course she goes on to say how she will speak to the manager on duty saturday and how she would give me a call.

On Mother's Day, 2015, we took a group of ten to the BJs in Brea.  We had reservations and were seated immediately.    We were off to a good start, but things went down hill quickly!!   Several of us ordered appetizer salads, which were brought out fairly quick.  Four of us ordered Fish and Chips, a couple burger orders, a pizza, and a few other items. While we were still eating our salads.. a server brought out ONE Fish and Chips and sat it down in front one of the moms who ordered it.   She hadn't even finished her salad, so she continued to finish her salad while waiting for everyone else's food to be delivered.   Her Fish and Chips just sat...  I figured, that the rest of the food was coming for all of us.  BUT NO...    a few minutes went buy, and no food for anyone else.  After over 5 minutes, I got up and looked for the floor manager and told her that one person in our party had her food, and no one else.   Finally, after another five minutes, the rest of the orders began to trickle out.  TEN MINUTES AFTER the first Fish and Chips were delivered to the table!!   By the time she started eating her fish...  IT WAS COLD!!!   Finally, everything was deliver EXCEPT THE PIZZA!!  After all this time, everyone was finally eating except the two that order PIZZA.    The PIZZA was finally delivered after waiting over 5 minutes more.   The manager brought it out and apologized for it coming out late, and said it would be taken off the bill.   LATE????   Everyone else was ALMOST FINISHED with their meals!! On top of everything else, several of the HOT food items were actually WARM to COLD!!!   The total for the table was upwards of $200.   I guess the real bothersome issue is...   I sent an EMAIL through BJs website, and received ABSOLUTELY NO RESPONSE....  not even an apology for the poor service and poor quality food!!  Obviously they were NOT prepared for Mother's Day and the impact of the crowd.  SORRY, not my problem!!!   We paid good money and received POOR service and POOR food quality.   And then, not even a response from BJs Home Office!  Why do they bother to place a comments section on their website, if they don't plan on responding??   Used to be a good place to eat, not so much anymore... especially on ""special days"" like Mothers Day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=360

I stood next to reception area, almost in front of her. I guess I should've stood in everyone's way. She tells me that it'll be another while. I told her it was a terrible to lose my reservation, then make use wait twice. They said they were very sorry. Then somehow they found a table 10 minutes later that they said they were setting up.  Told the front desk manager that it was unacceptable to treat customers this way. She said she was sorry but there was nothing she could do.  Table had only 3 settings for a group of 8. Waiter was ok, refilled our water. A PR manager came to discuss what happened and said his employees were shook up. I told him they should also worry about how their customers feel.

Matt C.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",143,57,86,3.0,2/22/2011,"BJ's is a great place to have a nice handcrafted, wonderful beer. The service is decent if you sit at the bar (not the bar area tables, but the proper bar) but if you sit at an actual table be prepared to wait a long time in between refills. The menu is a little too extensive for my liking, too many choices; it's like reading a book when you first sit down. After trying a few things there, I now know what to order without bothering to look at the menu. For lunch the all you can eat soup and salad is fantastic as is the ham and cheese melt with the tomato bisque. Dinner you can't really go wrong with the homemade meatloaf or the fish and chips.  Mostly I go there for the beer, and if it was just based upon that, they would have received five stars from me. The other great thing about this particular BJ's is they have special events a lot here. Scotch tasting for example, where for a small fee you get to sample about six different scotches and sometimes get a complimentary glass from the event, they also do this for different beers that they brew there throughout the year.  The bottom line is BJ's is a nice place to hang out after a long day at work with some good friends and some great beer.

I [overall] love this location because MOST of the servers I've encountered are really nice! And what a lot of people don't know is that they deliver! The reason I'm giving them 3 stars instead of 5 is because I was served raw hamburger meat once, I've been delivered cold food twice, my delivered food has smelled like cigarette smoke (I'm guessing that the delivery driver smoked while he was driving), and one time my server made a fuss that I asked her to bring me a new Shirley Temple because mine had too much syrup in it.  Now most of those are bad experiences with delivery and not dining in the restaurant but I do think that they should work on improving their delivery service especially something like serving raw meat.

Expected someone to come by and apologize and explain the situation, but not the manager or our server were seen. Everyone working there just whipped out their phones and began joking and looking outside.

As a server I expect a certain standard when dining out and usually tip 25-30% but was so outraged by the lack of care and courtesy i paid and left.

The food took a very long time to come out, but it was busy inside, so the kitchen was probably just backed up. However, leaving (by then it was no longer busy inside) was another story. We ended up spending about 30 minutes waiting for the check to be processed (we had it split on four cards and wrote how much to put on each card...it took an unreasonable amount of time...I was about to go in and check with someone when she finally came back out).

It does it's job, which is to fill the stomach, and feed a table of customers.  My main reason to come is for the pizookie. The concept is very easy and widely known, but for a pizza joint, it's much more interesting. A pizza sized cookie amounting to at most four cookie flavors is cooked in a deep-dish pizza pan and then topped off with two to three scoops of ice cream. Sugar rush, anyone?

Elena R.,"San Francisco, CA",0,11,,2.0,12/3/2014,"The two stars is for the kitchen. The food and drink are excellent here, and I have nothing but good things to say about that aspect of my experience here.  However, while out with friends at this certain BJs, there was one particular waitress who clearly hates her job. And if she doesn't hate her job, she has a funny way of showing that she actually cares about the service she gives. The welcoming host walks me and my party over to a booth, and then a couple minutes later, a waitress comes by, passes out napkins as if she's in a hurry and barks to us, ""Drinks?"" No ""Hi, welcome to BJs, how are you tonight?"" No, none of that. Just abruptly and rudely: ""Drinks?"" My party and I are taken aback by this, but she continues to take our drink and food order. When our food is ready, she comes out with the plates, slaps each one in front of us, and immediately leaves. She doesn't ask if we need anything else, like a refill, salt and pepper, etc. She just departs the table without speaking a word to us, her guests and customers. About 10 or 15 minutes later, another waiter comes by and introduces himself, and explains that our previous waitress' shift was over and went home for the day. Then, we all understand. This waitress decided not to give us the light of day because she was not going to get a tip out of us anyway since her shift would be completed before we finished eating. Therefore, she didn't even TRY to give us good service .  The next waiter was fine and dandy and everything like that, but come on. If you're a waitress, you're there to give great service. That is your job, and I understand tipping is a major part of the job's pay, but we came out to have a great time and have a great dinner service. And because of her, we didn't. I only wish I remembered her name.  In conclusion, the food is great, but there are clearly some duds within their waitstaff.

We waited for about 15 minutes not bad considering we were in on a Saturday night and there had just been a group of about 50 ppl leaving ...looked like prom.. But then we got seated and everything was fine our server Robert was nice and he got us drinks. Next we ordered an appetizer but we couldn't eat because we had no utensils and we couldn't find him or any other serve seems like he was the server for the area where we sat. Then we finally got our utensils then he asked us if we were doing okay and we said yes then our food came and after he didn't bother checking up on us.. Keep in mind he was not the person who brought out our food. So no refills or anything.. We waited a more then 30 minutes to get a hold of him for a refill I even put my cup towards the edge of the table where it was visible for him to see and get an idea that we needed refills. He was not attentive at all. When we asked for boxes he asked if we were having dessert so I ordered my dessert and I asked for a refill I got my dessert about 15 minutes later and I got my refill after I was all done with dessert and everything. He did not bother checking on us and I can just imagine the lack of device I would have received if I had been dinning in during there actual rush hour because it was pretty slow towards the time I got seated. I have came to this location on a Saturday night with a group of 10 and have gotten better service then this which was my first time at bjs and this is my second time here and I'm sad to say I won't be coming back.

Cinda L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,1.0,9/2/2015,"I tried this location a few more times and continued to receive the same crappy service and carelessness. One time our spinach artichoke dip hadn't even made it to the oven so it was completely liquid with unmelted cheese on top. One time the people next to us received their pasta dish sin pasta.... As in it was just the sauce and meat thrown in a bowl. HOW does the kitchen forget to include the main ingredient and how does the plate make it to the customers table without correcting the mistake?? We also received stale french fries once. I have since moved away from the area, but I had stopped going to that location and would drive an extra 15 minutes to the City of Industry location when I wanted BJ's. It's SO much better there and was SO worth the drive! They even made me an item that I used to love and is no longer on the menu!

It was a busy Saturday afternoon and server Shaun was pleasant enough, though we both asked for iced tea and never received it. Instead getting ice water that was refilled in fits and starts from a half full carafe with no ice in it at all. His inability to hear us was matched only by ours to hear him, as he was incredibly soft spoken for the atmosphere in this place. $8.95 Potato skins? Haven't had any in ages once we realized how incredibly bad they are for someone to eat more than a sliver of them. I really liked the fried-ness of them. I didn't like the stinginess with which they doled out the cheese and bacon, though. Also, the monkey dishes they use for dipping sauce are WAY too small. $5.95 Clam chowder was tasty and a decent portion size as well. $3.50 Fried artichoke hearts were not too oily and tasted good. Great price since it was an add-on to an entrée. $12.75 Chicken fried steak was quite disappointing. The vegetable mix (baby carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, and squash) didn't really suit the dish. One decent sized dollop of their signature white cheddar mashed potatoes had two hamburger patty sized cfs's canted at an angle leaning on the mashed potatoes. A meager splash of thin pepper gravy was dropped on top of this. When I asked for extra gravy they server brought another one of those half ounce monkey dishes. Gee, thanks buddy. $17.50 Miso salmon dinner was a bright spot for the visit. The wife liked it more than a lot, although she did mention the rice bed it was on tasted like it came out of a cheap box.  All in all, it didn't really make me want to return any time soon.

Pizzas came out quickly!  We were pleasantly surprised. After we all had our pieces served, we took our first bite.  I noticed that my pizza was not hot. It was just warm. How could this be when they just brought it to the table? Told the server and he apologized and said it was weird because they were not busy. The  manager came over and offered to comp the pizza... That's not what we wanted, we were not complaining to get free stuff. We ordered desserts as well... Chocolate chip pizookie and a red velvet pizookie. These too, came out under baked!!  The red velvet one was still doughy and gooey.  The chocolate chip one was edible, but still didn't finish it. We spoke to the server abt this. He did take off the red velvet pizookie. It was awful.  When I go out to eat, I want to eat HOT food. That's why I gave this restaurant 1 star... Our food was not hot and cookie was not baked enough.

The differences between the three is that the cookies and cream had vanilla ice cream with a cookies and cream whipped cream, the bottom is like a soft oreo cookie.  The triple chocolate has chocolate ice cream and a dark chocolate cookie part.  The red velved had little white chunks and i couldnt tell if it was white chocolate or nuts but they could have gone without it because it made it chewy.

A manager only came by and took our cash to pay the bill. No apology from the manager. We won't be meeting there again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=480

This was for late night on Mother's day. The seats were dirty, we didn't even have utensils until we asked, the calamari was sad in terms of amount. I've never had such a poor experience. Our server was excellent but the management needs to work on it. There was a server I guess she was off duty, but her bf/friend and another guy was just lingering in the lobby hugging and kissing. Then walked out with arms around each other's shoulder.

Ben M.,"Fullerton, CA",0,4,,5.0,7/16/2014,"Im not here to vouch for other peoples dinning experience, but the five stars I am giving is specifically for our waitress Isabelle. After reading some of the reviews, my buddy and I were a little skeptical of coming. I know a bad service experience does kill the whole mood and enjoyability of our food.  We came here not knowing what to order, so she starts off with asking general questions of what we like, we simmered down, and we eventually ordered 1) seared honey lime scallops 2) Chipotle glazed salmon 3) BBQ pizza. Im more of a seafood guy and my buddy is more of a pizza burger kinda guy. Ive never let the waitress order for me which made me kinda nervous but in the end I am very glad I did. The honey lime scallops are cooked to perfection with no raw fishy smell. Same goes for the salmon and the perfect chipotle glaze. It is not too overpowering to where you cannot even taste the fish. As for the pizza, she recommended getting it slightly well done because sometimes the dough might be a little too soft for someones liking.  We started off with a beer taster and ended up washing everything down with their jeremiah red and hopstorm IPA. I tried their seasonal hoppy Scotsman, let me tell you this..I am not a fan of that beer. Its too hoppy for me. should've guessed by the name they chose for the beer baby.  Because of her recommendations and slight modifications, we had an awesome experience. Next time, we are definitely going to request for her. For someone to actually take the time of their day to suggest things and make sure you get what you really want is awesome.  The only  bad thing I have to say about this restaurant is that during the games, it is completely impossible to get seating in the bar (understandable).

I came here after not being to BJ's since like elementary school so it's been like 10 years. I think I came here when I was like in 6th grade and I got a pizza or something. I don't really remember. So for my birthday lunch with one of my friends, I decided it was good to revisit it. The drinks looked good, and the menu of drinks was created by various BJ employees so that was pretty cool. We were able to see where they were from and what drink they created. Since I was driving, I thought it was a good idea not to drink. Instead, my friend and I each ordered our dishes and an appetizer to share.  Food: Spinach Artichoke Dip - It comes with these really good corn tortilla chips. The dip itself was really good too. Warm chips and delicious dip? That's my kind of appetizer.  Half Sandwich and Salad - this is one of their many lunch specials. I decided to go with the California Chicken Sandwich. The sandwich was too oily and buttery for me. The bread was fried and it gave it nice texture for a while, but after a while, it was just soggy. The avocado and chicken were nice. The salad was average, but decent. It also came with french fries - yum. They were amazing or anything, but it's been a while since I've had french fries so they were good.

Once food trickles out, one persons food will arrive while the other persons food will come 10-15 minutes later. This is very common. Now, while waiting for the second meal, we have time to examine the first meal to see they tend to skimp on everything. For instance, we ordered cheese potato wedges. It appears that they ran out of cheese cause one out of eight wedges had cheese, the rest may have had one or two strands of shredded cheese. Some had none.

My son called to find out what happened, after I told him, he said the server thought it was strange that I would put no sausage, so they assumed it meant that I wanted it.  First off, never assume, second, all they needed to do was pickup the phone to verify my order, but they didn't . So now they tell my son, he has to wait 20 minutes for a new pizza.  I told him, if that is the case, they need to remake both, because the other one that is correct, will be cold.  They told my son that the correct pizza is in the warmer and that they will not make a new one and that it will be fine.  I told my son to talk with a manager, which he informed me he did ask, but one never showed up. Well, sure enough, just like I thought, the pizza they did get correct was cold and overcooked, as we all know it would be.  There was no attempt at any compensation/apology for their mistake and  for the time my son had to waste waiting for a new pizza, since they decided to guess at what I may or may not want on my pizza.  I thought that the number one rule in customer service, is the the customer is always right. It is obvious that this location doesn't believe in that, and to top it all off, the pizza's were very greasy and made my wife sick.  Last time we visit this location!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=400

We all had to stand outside in the rain because the inside was packed with employees walking back and forth and another group took up the chairs.  After about 40 minutes of waiting, we asked the host what was going on. He said it would be an additional 15-20 minutes.

We checked in periodically only to be told to wait an additional 10 minutes. Finally after standing outside in the cold for about TWO HOURS, our table was ready.

In fact, many of the other choices on the menu are just as good or even better.  I often choose Bjs as the place to go to watch a laker game. They have a pretty good happy hour. Decent prices for drinks and half off on personal pizzas. The environment is also great for happy hour.

Kim N.,"Lexington, KY",201,572,15,2.0,9/23/2010,"You know, if I had written this review after my second-to-the-last visit, this would have gone a whole other way. But my last visit was so unfortunate that the review is getting skewed way to the other side.  Here is the thing - I have never had a problem dining in the restaurant. Service is good, pizza is actually really good - I like it. But then I got cocky and thought that I would place an order online for pick-up. And I got really crazy by typing in a special request.  So, I show up to pick up the two pizzas I ordered, right at the time they are supposed to be ready (40 minutes from when I placed the order). A girl comes to the counter with one of the pizzas and here is what entails: BJs - Your order is ready! (however, she has only one pizza) Me - Do you have my other pizza too? I ordered two pizzas.  BJs - (looks at printed order) I have a gluten-free pizza and a spinach-artichoke pizza. Right? Me - Yes, but you only have one pizza there. Where is the other one? BJs - There is only one pizza on the order.  Me - No, you just read two pizzas - one that is a gluten-free pizza and one that is a spinach-artichoke pizza. BJs - Right.  Me - But you only have one pizza here.  BJs - Hmmm... Okay - so after we finally establish that there should be two pizzas, she remembers that she doesn't have the other one because they could not accommodate my special request. So, instead of calling me to see what I wanted to do, they just made up the one pizza and thought that would be cool. What? So, she said that they could make the other pizza for me now that I was there and could instruct them as to what was okay, but I pointed out that the first pizza would be totally cold by then (we still had to take these home to eat them). I asked to speak with a manager and insisted that they remake the first pizza while they made the second pizza so that both would be fresh and ready at the same time. The manager was very nice and said that wouldn't be a problem.  Of course, no discount was offered for the inconvenience of having to sit there and wait 15 minutes for the pizzas (hello, the entire reason I placed my order online was so that I didn't have to sit and wait there) and to top everything off, I got home to find that my spinach-artichoke pizza had artichokes, but no spinach.

Leslie P.,"Brea, CA",8,34,,5.0,6/18/2013,"My 5 star review is based on my most recent visit only. See, although I live locally, I have not been a patron of this restaurant in about 10 years. I'm not sure if something happened that long ago that would've made me not want to go back, but anyhow, my husband and  children wanted to celebrate my birthday over dinner and I chose BJ's because they have giant stuffed baked potatoes which I have been totally craving. BJs did not disappoint! Our server was Sam G.... Nicest guy ever! Great service, friendly and perfectly attentive. The food was great... I ended up ordering a pizza instead of the potato. WARNING! Their deep dish pizza is great but every pizza comes with tomatoes piled on top with your chosen toppings. Fortunately I remembered this and ordered it without! My husband ordered some kind of jambalaya dish, my daughter had the fish and chips and my son the bacon cheeseburger. Everyone was very pleased with their meals! I tried my sons cheeseburger, it was very tasty and cooked perfectly well done, as my son had ordered. They offered me dessert (a small pizookie and ice cream) as it was my birthday,but I was stuffed from the delicious pizza so they packed it to go. It didn't last long once I got home... That thing was just too good!  A+ for BJ's brewery in Brea and Sam G!  I will definitely go again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=400

Anne P.,"Orange County, CA",1090,116,240,1.0,9/11/2013,"This visit already started off bad when the hostess walked me to my seat and there were food crumbs alllllllll over the booth. SMH. Worst customer service that I have ever had at a BJ's. My guests and I hardly saw our waitress except for taking our order and bringing us our food. She never asked us how we were doing and it took forever and a day to get our bill delivered and returned. But that wasn't the worst part... THERE WAS A BUG IN MY FOOD!!!! At first I thought it was a flying bug but it still stayed there and I tried shooing it away. Disgusting! Last time I am getting the Thai shrimp lettuce wrap. The manager tried making me feel better by making me a new plate but when he brought it over, I was already disgusted by the previous plate. He then asked me if I wanted something else so I said calamari. It took another 10 mins for that to come out and by that time I was already over the whole experience. The waitress still took her sweet time, it was so miserable being served by her. The check came and I loved that the manager comped the calamari but left the shrimp lettuce wrap, you know the one WITH THE BUG IN IT! I had to wait another 5 minutes for him and when I told him he said ""Oh, I thought I took that off"". No sir, no you didn't. You obviously did not care enough to take the time to make sure everything was ok. I did not even get to express my feeling about my experience, he cut me off when I started talking. Ugh, totally disgusted by this manager, the lame waitress, just the overall vibe from this place.  Best believe that waitress did not get a tip and I for one will not come back to this location. I rather go to Yardhouse in Brea. It's only 5 mins down the street, the service and food is better.

Apart from being threatening and offensive about an alcohol-related ID delay for our international guest (who don't carry around passports around all the time; honest mistake), we ordered a 1/2 Sweet Pig 1/2 BJ's favorite. Apart from the waitress being rude and cold, she put in a wrong order and looked extremely annoyed at us when we told her the mistake when the pizza was brought over. To make matters worse, we waited over an HOUR for the right pizza to arrive afterwards. The manager, Leon, looked heavily disinterested in our complained and actually tried to charge us for the incorrect pizza and tried to be ""making us happy"" by discarding that charge, even though we didn't order that pizza. I even wanted to order a pzookie but was discouraged after the entire ordeal. The (now closed) Long Beach and Cerritos branches have much better service.

Aileen A.,"Anaheim Hills, Anaheim, CA",61,5,,1.0,9/15/2013,"I usually like this BJs but if i could give my experience tonight zero stars i would. I've never ever experienced the lack of customer service. I rarely write a review or even complain but my experience today was beyond words and ridiculous. The head manager of this establishment does not the the meaning of customer service. We came here to celebrate a friends birthday. One of our friends who might I add is 32 years old wanted to order a drink, but he didn't have his ID. We all knew that it would be tough to order a drink but we wanted to at least try. So we spoke to the head manager and her exact words were ""no offense but you're not worth my Job."" And I'm sorry but regardless of the situation you as the head manager should never say that to a customer. Besides that we tried to have a good time. We ordered 2 large pizzas one came out so cold that the cheese wasnt even melted and the dough wasn't even cooked through and the other came out wrong, we ordered a pepperoni and pineapple pizza but it came out without pineapple. The server who was training apologized and took it back but then brought it back and they literally just sprinkled pineapple on top. It was edible but not good. We weren't going to say anything until the couple next to us pulled a handful of hair off their pizza. At this point no one could eat anymore. We asked to see the managers again and a different manager came and he was extremely accommodating and he was truly embarrassed at the quality of food that was given to us. He was extremely apologetic and he took off our two pizzas from the bill.

I really appreciated it and it is unusual to find this quality in a 'chain'.  My regret was not getting the names of our servers so I could write a nice letter to their corporate office - they deserve this recognition. I would highly recommend coming here with a large group (providing you arrange it ahead of time).  I've been to BJ's (different city) with a larger group a couple of times and it was a disaster - but I think the difference was they knew about our party well in advance and could plan and staff accordingly.  :D  Good job Brea BJ's!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=460

Well lets start off with the beer.  They do call themselves a brewhouse and their beers do not disappoint.  They are relatively inexpensive and are much better than the other beers you may order (bud light, miller lite, etc....)  I have tried about half of them and am pleased with all of them. The food here while good is a little pricy.  With their specialty deep dish pizzas costing around $10 for a small this is just outrageous.  Their pizzas are about the size of a pizza hut personal pan pizza and they charge you $10 no way jose.  That is why I only order pizza during happy hour when it is half off.  Definite win.  The pizzas are of high quality, they are delicious, but definitely not worth $10, maybe about $8 but not $10.   The real reason for me to come here though is the pizookie.  It is a warm freshly baked cookie topped with ice cream and man is it delicious.  They come in flavors from the original chocolate chunk to red velvet.  I have tried almost all of them and they are all equally delicious.  I have come here on a few occasions just for the pizookie and I wish that they would have these go on special on happy hour too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=460

We came here for dinner, and started off with fairly good service.  I will not name the server, but he was friendly and seemed on top of things at the beginning of our meal.  However, he appeared to be overwhelmed by a large table next to us, and forgot to put in out appetizer order.  We eventually received our appetizers, the avocado spring rolls and the stuffed mushrooms, which were both good.  We then had a long wait for our entrees, and when they arrived, they were incorrect; I had ordered a white pizza without tomatoes, and it arrived laden with tomatoes.  As our server did not check on us for quite some time, and they were dropped off by a runner, we didn't have any opportunity to request that they be fixed.  Other than the incorrect order, the food was fine.   We then had a long wait for the check; it was such a long wait that we decided not to order dessert.  When we received the check, we saw that our server had not put in the ""no tomatoes"" request on the pizza, so it was clearly not the fault of the kitchen staff.

Ian W.,"Pelham, NH",715,3717,5928,4.0,1/31/2010,"BJ's Brew House is one of my favorite late night places to go for happy hour, which offers discounted appetizers ($2 off), mini pizzas (half off), and drinks ($1 off drafts & cocktails). I can come to BJ's to relax and unwind and enjoy some pretty good pub food and drinks at a great price. On my way back to the SGV (my CA home), I always stop at this BJ's near the Brea Mall (conveniently located off the 57 Fwy) after spending a long day and evening solo at Disneyland running around to many rides and attractions. I do make it a point to consume minimal food and drink at the theme park since the prices there are very inflated. I come here very hungry and extremely exhausted from all of the excitement of seeing Mickey, Minnie, Goofy, Tigger and friends. I'm going directly from a fun place for kids (Disneyland) to a fun place for grown-ups (not Vegas, hehe). I usually seat myself at a high top table near the bar area with a good view of the flatscreen TVs, bartenders (*wink*), and for prompt service. On my last visit, I had a good pale ale & Diet Coke with a Mediterranean mini pizza and a big plate of Angus Beef Sliders & Fries. The food was up in 15 minutes. This is just what I needed! The Mediterranean deep dish pizza was good and very filling and greasy and had a soft firm crust topped with grilled chicken, basil pesto, roasted garlic, Kalamata olives, sun-dried tomatoes, feta cheese & sliced peperoncinis. In my book, the crust for this deep dish pizza takes a close second place to Pizzeria Uno's (Chicago Grill) deep dish pizza, which has a firmer and tastier crust. The pile of Angus beef sliders served on toasted mini buns were great tasting with my one beer, which came with golden brown shoestring fries and lettuce, tomato slices, and pickles. I was stuffed and took some of the food home. Overall, BJ's has been very dependable with solid good pub food and drinks. The service was prompt and I was given another refill on the Diet Coke without asking (brownie points).

Throw in a fresh white mac pizookie for good measure. -1 star: BJ's beer tastings, while few and far between, have been known to have the on-time percentage of your average wedding. But this time? Not only were some offerings forced to be scratched off the tasting list for reasons unknown, but it just took foreeeeever. Something that started at 7:30 and ended at past 10:30 on a Tuesday night about 40 miles from my house does not equal a good time. Also... the bathroom could use a little more constant maintenance. Also... some of the servers toward the end of the night, especially standing by the bathrooms, should not be standing around talking shit or whatever about whoever. I just browsed through some other reviews of this joint -- what is up with all that unprofessionalism? It's Brea, for God's sake -- not Spring Break Tijuana. Also... caveat emptor: their new ""happy hour"" appetizers mostly aren't worth it. Angus beef sliders + fries = totally worth $5, but $4 for five tiny chicken nuggets with some sauce? Not again, thanks. Bottom line: I love the Belgian Winter Warmers theme; BAP was definitely worth it even with the slight price increase. Jen and Laurel are prime examples of the potential kindness and awesomeness that emanate from a BJs.

The BBQ chicken one is also popular, but it's too sweet for my taste and I think the one at CPK is better.  Their appetizers are all pretty good! I love their potato skins, spinach and artichoke dip, and avocado egg rolls. Unfortunately, they have this new ahi poke that I tried and it was totally gross! Basically just pieces of tuna and chips with nori on them. Uhhh, the name of the dish is actually poke, so I had to ask the waiter where the poke was...and then they had the nerve to bring out soy sauce for me!

BJs is known for their excellent deep dish pizzas and their well-known handcrafted beers. During this visit, one of their featured beers was a peach flavored beer, which was very tasty. Ordered BJs Favorites (the works - craving sausage) Pizza and Chicken Cesar Salad, which the pizza might have needed slightly more marinara, but otherwise great service.

But I have to say, the service at this BJ's is absolutely horrible. Every time I come in to eat here, the service is slow and food takes forever to come out. I became obsessed with their pizzaookies and would sometimes order them to go, but i stopped doing this since they take FOREVER to make simple mini pizzaookie. Last time i waited 45 for two mini pizzaookies on a slow Tuesday night! The guy who took my order kept apologizing and was really nice. Despite the fact that he messed up on my order twice, i still tipped him only, because I understand how difficult customers can be. but waiting 45 minutes for a freaking pizzaookie is ridiculous. Not to mention the fact that when you call ahead to order they put you on hold for the longest time. The food is good, but they need faster service.

Geoff O.,"Alexandria, VA",49,197,2,4.0,2/16/2011,"I've been a fan of BJ's ever since it opened back in the 90s. There's nothing particularly noteworthy about it, but BJ's offers solid food at a good value. I think that;'s one of the best things about it - management has smartly weathered the recession by keeping prices comparatively low (plenty of entrees for under $10) and quality up. Service has generally been good and attentive at this location. Like anything, some servers are better than others, but most seem to strive to be on the ball and communicative with patrons. Happy hour is a great deal here. I don't even drink, but soda is half off and appetizers are either half or $2 off. You can really make a killing if you swing by there for either happy hour (there's the typical post-work, pre-dinner one, and another that starts at 10). Two appetizers, drinks, and even a pizookie will barely set you back more than $20.  The place goes bonkers, though, during busy hours and weekends, so be advised. Wait times can be absurd. It's also a louder, rowdier sort of place, so keep that in mind if you are taking anyone who's hard of hearing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=540
Krystal R.,"Anaheim, CA",209,188,198,4.0,8/2/2010,"There are lots of tasty and wonderful reasons why I love BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse.  It's a chain restaurant that I don't mind visiting every now and then. I've frequented this location many times, and my husband and I even hosted our wedding rehearsal dinner here. On this occasion, we were out having a late dinner with our fave couple, Adrian and Monica. There are a couple must haves' on the menu that are pretty darn delicious: Starters- BEER! It's a brewhouse - you gotta have a beer with your meal!! BJ's Brewhouse blonde is a great choice for those who like something light and refreshing with a slight touch of hoppiness. My husband prefers hoppy beers - something with a little tang to it and he would order either the Jeremiah Red or Piranha pale ale. They both have big bold flavors and very high alcohol content. However my number one choice since I'm not a beer aficionado - I always order the berry burst cider blend with beer - it's a beautiful blend of beer and mixed berries - it's so refreshing to drink. It's better than pear cider! Appetizers - My number one pick is avocado egg rolls and Bruschetta. Inside the eggroll is a delicious pairing of cream cheese and avocado with some spices. It  almost tastes like an avocado butter with the cream cheese. The filling pairs well with the crispy wonton shells and the sweet and spicy tamarind dipping sauce is mouthwatering delicious. This is truly an APP-TEASER!!! Our main entrée for the four of us was easy decision - PIZZA! They have a great selection of signature deep dish pizzas and we quickly picked the Southwestern pizza. The description and picture sold us immediately ""chipotle tomato sauce with spicy blackened chicken, green chiles, cheddar cheese and diced tomatoes with fresh cilantro."" Yum and YUUUUUUM. Monica and I like to plan ahead for dessert, since a pizookie is one of our favorite desserts here. It's one of the main reasons we visit!! We decided a smaller size pizza - the medium would be perfect fit for us - anything bigger - we would stuff our faces silly with pizza.  Southwestern pizza was a tad spicer than I thought it would be, but it was still delicious. It had a great combination of flavors that melded together beautifully on a pizza. I don't know if was the spicy chicken or the chipotle spice sauce that made my mouth on fire. Make sure to have a couple glasses of water on the side just in case if it's too spicy for you.  And of course, we got our desserts....the PIZOOKIE. It's a pizza shaped cookie made in a mini pizza pan and it's freshly baked with two big scoops of vanilla ice cream. Eric and I love the traditional flavors of the oatmeal-raisin walnut cookie and Monica and Adrian got the ooey-gooey cookies and cream pizookie. It truly completes the glorious meal to a perfect tee. Beer, pizza and pizookie...definitely a great dinner with great friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=540

It's a personal deep dish pizza with one topping plus a salad of your choice for a great price.

Sarah S.,"Yorba Linda, CA",24,125,17,4.0,4/10/2011,"One thing I have to say... be careful of how many drinks you order! The Strawberry Confusion (my favorite) is $9.50 per, and I can easily order two... which will definitely run up your bill. Food is pretty good, nothing ground breaking and definitely good enough to make me want to return. Salads are HUGE, pizzas are a good amount to eat, balsamic glazed chicken is pretty good (sometimes the chicken can be a little dry), California Chicken Sandwich is good as well. Jambalaya is good but is also around $16!  I think my main complaint is that the food is a little more on the pricey side, but it has a good ambience and has large TVs (and many of them). Can be a little loud so don't go if you want to enjoy the company of your date quietly. It's a more comfortable (and well lit) Cheesecake Factory - good for groups, though the wait can be a little long sometimes.  Beer snobs may not like this place for their brews... I don't drink beer though, and am only repeating the comment that I've heard a few times from a few friends. Most people enjoy the beers here though, so don't let that stop you from trying some.  Even if you're not particularly hungry, be sure to get a pizookie (pizza cookie... served warm from the oven with a scoop of ice cream).

Came here a couple of times in the past, but on my last visit (last week) I came specifically to evaluate the pizza...BJ's is not the best nor the biggest - and overpriced.  First off, the CRUST is airy and puffy. I personally prefer substantive, doughy, chewy crust - sort of like good bread...not airy, puffy and light. If that's your thing, then I suppose BJ's is right for you. I think this place tries to model their pizza's after Chicago style...I just decided I don't like this style.  Hey, but that's just my opinion. Hey, anyone out there know of a good pizza with the kind of crust I'm speaking about?

This location seems to always have great service and a wait team that actually seems to enjoy what they do and enjoy working together. Makes a big difference in my dining experience. Just steer clear on game days, the drunken patrons hitting on the waitresses makes service a bit slow. BJ's favorite is the pizza that constantly beckons me and I never am disappointed. Crust is thick and cooked perfectly crisp, cheese is melted and gooey, not too saucy, and plenty of toppings. I need to use a fork and knife for this pizza experience, but I am okay with that because it keeps my pizza slices to a total of two. It is so filling and I have plenty of leftovers for later.

They get extremely busy, but you can see the staff working as a team. If there's ever a long wait you can head up to the bar and find an open table, it's full menu. If you go save room for pizookie!

Through the years, BJ's has added too many items to the menu, gotten away from making great pizza, and no longer brews their own beer.  Always a sure hit, their Piranha Pale Ale, is now another macro-brew tasting ale.  It misses the mark totally.  Same as the Double-Double pizza.  We used to come here for the brewery tours and beer tastings, now no longer available.  I still have a couple clear glass growlers in the garage from the days when they brewed on-site. In all, BJ's has lost step with what made them a local favorite in favor of expanding into another chain offering generic, bland food to the masses.

Anita C.,"Chino, CA",82,22,5,1.0,4/16/2014,"Working 5 minutes away from the mall, BJ's has always been a very popular lunch choice for my coworkers and I.  While usually our visits are enjoyable and pleasant, this one was far from such.  Upon arriving at 12:07, we were not greeted by our server Andrew until 12:18.  He passed out our menus and came back at 12:30 to take our order.  We ordered soup and salads off the lunch menu (one of us ordered a half sandwich and salad).  We received our salads at approx 12:35...as we finished our salads, we continued to wait for our soups and half of a sandwich which never came.  Nor did our server.  I approached the bar and asked the bartender to get a manager for me.  When the manager (Ryan) arrived, I explained what had happened and he responded with just:  ""I'm sorry"".  Although he did take care of food portion of the bill, his lack of any further customer service is atrocious.  Furthermore, once the bill was paid for the one drink that was ordered, our server Andrew returned and made a comment stating that next time, if we are in a hurry, we have the option to ""call ahead"" so our food is ready.  So apparently, it is our fault for choosing to eat at BJ's restaurant for our hour long lunch hour.  Due to the lack of service and food, I had to call our boss and explain that we would be late back to work because we were going to have to stop at Subway to be able to grab something to eat!  I am extremely disappointed with my experience today and hope that something is done so that further patrons do not experience the same thing.  I have forwarded my concerns to the corporate office as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=560

Kimberly T.,"Anaheim, CA",218,78,139,4.0,9/26/2010,"So I agree with the review below mine (Hi Troy! Class of 2004!) where this is an easy place to go to, but not necessarily a great one. It's great for groups or parties because they have a lot of tables, both inside and out. My pros outweigh the cons, but I'll start with the cons: -Sucky service! The waiters are so slow! They only good thing they do is that they cut your pizza for you. -The BJ's parking lot isn't so big. And you're constantly fighting with the Cheesecake customers for parking, whether it's in the restaurants' lot or in the mall lot. -The amount of people that are crowding each other waiting to be seated. The pros: -Awesome pizza! My sister, friends and I love the BBQ Chicken Pizza. I've tried others, and they're just as yummy :) -Their BBQ items are really good. Their BBQ salad is really good, along with the burgers/sandwiches. -PIZOOKIES!!! -The remotes that they give you that beep and turn red when it's your turn to be seated. I'm running out of pros and cons, but basically, this place is a good place to eat when you're undecided. It's a good go-to restaurant that's affordable, which pretty decent food. The servers are a hit or miss, so hopefully you get a good one. If you're a first-timer, get a pizza :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=560

I've been there a few times before and didn't expect much as far as the food or service goes. I was expecting average service and a TGIF-ish ambiance.  But let me tell you something, our server was THE man. Friendly, FAST, and helpful. Just all around great service. We stayed until the place closed but the staff didn't rush us. They were polite the entire time. I had the fish tacos and a stout. I was starving so my judgement may have been skewed  but I'm sure they were close to amazing. Best fish tacos I've had in more than a year. Easy. It's probably different on the weekend, but we went on a Thursday night so the ambiance was mostly family. There were some high chairs and gray hairs. No loud music. Wasn't expecting much from this place, but I'm giving four stars because our server over delivered.

Andrew S.,"Orange, CA",146,18,,4.0,12/30/2011,"I've been to this place about 3 or 4 times now, and my star rating is in between 3 or 4. But I'm a nice guy and I give it 4. :P The staff and service is always quick and prompt. I ate here yesterday and we had a really big party. Around 15 or 18 I think? Each time we were running low on drinks they were always fast to refill em' up without us even asking. We had a lot of people come in late but the waiters were really good about it and they knew which people just walked in and everything. The only thing that was a bit odd was that the waiters weren't as friendly as usual. They seemed very ""business-bee"" and they were like, ""What do you want? Do do you want soup or salad on the side? Okay."" And they were off. But that doesn't bother me too much. The food experience will differ however. They have a very very large menu for a restaurant. I don't think I've come across a menu that large before. Its 14 pages long! My goodness! Its so hard to pick something because there's so many damn things! I spent 10 minutes figuring out what to get. Normally their pizzas are always on the mark. Its always hot and full of flavor. The bread and crust were AMAZING. It wasn't too soft and it wasn't too hard. It just had the right amount of bite to it. And no matter which pizza you get, based on what I've had, I'm confident that they'll satisfy you. Some of their other things are okay. Like their New Orleans Jambalaya, that was not what I expected to be. It was definitely under seasoned and it was missing that spicy kick to it. It tasted very meh, too much of tomatoes. Definitely needed more paprika and cayenne. It was not worth $15. I also tried their balsamic glazed chicken, that wasn't bad either. The chicken definitely need more salt and pepper, but that's what the salt and pepper shakers are for. It also definitely needed some more of that balsamic glaze. It was a small amount of sauce they put with it! As for their pazookies, don't even get me started. You will always enjoy the pazookie if you're in the mood for something fattening and sweet. So in short, food here is good, you will be content with it. Its just that the higher calorie foods taste a lot better. LOL.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=560

Andrew L.,"Santa Ana, CA",36,7,,2.0,12/13/2011,"I've been to this location time and time again, but lately (past year) I've seen it get progressively worse. Within the last year I have been to this location about six times and each time I left unsatisfied. I typically get the pizzas because they are usually delicious, crispy on the outside, moist on the inside. Lately, whenever I get the pizzas they either have very little toppings on them, almost as if I'm eating a cheese pizza or they are dry and warm on the verge of room temperature.  I actually just went there tonight, and my pizza was as described above. My girlfriend ordered the seared ahi salad, substituted with raw ahi poke tuna rather than seared and received what was expected, however the tuna was old, dry and very pale in color.  Now as for the service. The execution of customer service was on the verge of minimal standards. We sat at the bar tables, took us almost 20 minutes before even being asked for drinks. I ordered the hand crafted root beer which by quality standards of other BJ's that I have been to typically comes in a nice frosty mug, this time it came in a room temperature mug and no ice. However, when she refilled it, it came in a nice frosty mug and very cold. When receiving my dish I was not offered or given Parmesan and crushed pepper for my pizza. I had already been through my first slice when the waitress was collecting dishes from the table behind me, grabbed the cheese and pepper from the table then offered it to me. I may be going a little extreme about this part but it rubbed me the wrong way. Then as we were barely half way through our dishes the waitress came and asked if we wanted dessert we declined and she decided to leave the check for us. A little prematurely in my opinion, but maybe that's just me. We finished eating, she took my card and when she came back, placed the check, and said the usually ""thanks and have a good night"" etc, but she said it as she was walking away without making any eye contact.  Maybe I'm expecting too much or maybe I'm just used to the service I get at the other BJ's. BJ's isn't a bad place, i love the Harvest Hef, pizzas and pazookies, but this location just does not cut it for me. I would rather drive the extra miles to go to the Huntington Beach location off the 405, that place has never steered me wrong.

I had calamari and the potato skin plate. I also had a medium pizza with mushrooms and pepperoni. It was decent. It could've used some more tomato sauce. There was almost none on it. The highlight of this place is definitely their pizookies. Delicious and sweet dessert. But it should be renamed Diabetes on a Plate. So bad for you, but so so good. The environment can be summed up in one word. Chaos. People all over the place in a super cramped restaurant. Not really my type of environment. The service was alright though.

It's a great place to meet up with friends in small or large groups. The deep dish pizzas are to die for but if you are looking for something lighter the salads are yummy as well. Quick tip: If you come with a large group it's easier to have the server split by person. It's become easier to split and it helps the confusion.

The pizza is amazing, their calzone is even better, and the pazookies are what I fantasize about, sending me into fits of cursing myself for having ever decided to diet. Pazookies... Anyway, yes, the food is good, that's established. So you may be asking yourself, ""But Gabe, why are you only giving them 3 stars LOL?"" (That's my favorite phrase) Well, because they can't seem to figure things out quickly, the service sucks, and if you ever need anything taken care of, you end up being ""That guy"" who hunted down the manager. The hunt was quick, by the way. His camouflage did him no good. I had a real easy request (read: Demand). I just moved here from NorCal, and the Sharks were playing the Kings. I called ahead of time and asked if they would be showing ""The Kings game."" They assured me they were. I picked this place over any other sports bar, or bar that I could have gone to. When I get there, it takes a while to get a drink ordered, which is never a happy time. At one point, I was considering asking the bartender to stop grabbing the other bartender's ass and maybe try and earn some money. I didn't... There's no hope for those who don't want a decent tip. After getting a drink (finally) I asked about the game. The bartender, while catching glances from his coworker, informed me that they wouldn't be showing it. Excuse me? Go check again. I sent him on a few wild goose chases trying to figure something out, while frantically calling 411 to find a bar that would show it- Hockey is important! Finally, I was forced to get the manager, and it was amazing how quickly he was able to tell me when it would be on, on which TVs, and that I should order another drink. He was very persuasive, and unbelievably helpful. I usually don't interact with the wait staff more than ordering, so normally this would be a 5 star attraction... But sitting at the bar is utter hell, competing with one bartender to get the others attention. In the end, I will go back... I like their drinks and they'll play the games, but just a recommendation for that bartender, if he reads this: When you're going to make out with your coworker and not get me another drink, don't do it out in the front.

I have been to this location more times than any other BJ. Why? I really don't know. It's about 30 minutes away from me on the highway that I never can drink till the point that I could get a cab ride back.  I suppose I come here because all the friends willing to come here live in the area and they don't want to get drunk far from home. Oh well, doesn't mean I can't enjoy the pitchers that come out.  The line is long. I mean, both for this place and the near by cheese cake factory, you can face a two hour wait at times. really frustrating but if you arrive there early enough, you'll get your table without too much of a wait.  The pizza, while I'm not always in the mood for Chicago style pizza, was pretty good. Over the course of time I have had to had everyone at least twice. I still like the BBQ chicken one the best.

The service won't let you down either, our waiter was even eager to share his experience of tasting the deep dish cheeseburger pizza with us (""do you want ketchup?""), and the Pizookie dessert is a hell of a way to end your experience, (to die for, but not literally, no choking...)

Alan J.,"Los Angeles, CA",111,75,,4.0,4/7/2010,"Gotta review this place, I worked here for about 9 months when I was in college so I know the menu and atmosphere pretty well.  BJ's is good for pretty much anything.  Drinks after work, a birthday party that can seat lots of people, a brewery for the beer lovers, excellent happy hours, a great place to watch a sports game, or a good place to take the family.  I've had the menu many times over and their pizza is the best thing on it for sure.   During happy hour mini pizzas are $5, which is a great deal for the quality you get.  The bar pops off, so if you're looking for  a crowd, the place is always full.  The nachos are huge, I like the spinach dip and chicken tenders.  You can choose from any of 6 sauces with everythign you get, honey mustard, ranch, thousand island, bleu cheese, and a couple others I can't recall.   Overall, I give the place a 4 because while the food is good, I wouldn't come here if I was looking for a great meal.  I wouldn't come here if I was looking for a good whiskey, or  any type of really good drink.   If I was single, I wouldn't come here to ""mingle"".  I'd rather go to Yardhouse down the street or Taps.    So the point is, this BJ's is solid for any occasion, but not great for any.  4-5 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=600
Ken M.,"Long Beach, CA",49,106,2,3.0,6/30/2009,"I came here on a Saturday night, and while the lines were long, I went right in because my friends were already sitting at a table. It was my first time at BJ's and the first thought that came to my mind is that this is going to be another chain home style resturants similar to TGIFs. But to my surprise, it was the total opposite of TGIFs, it has the ambergris of the pubs you find in England with the crappy British food. They brew their own beer here, and I enjoy the blonde ale here.  Food-wise, I had the roasted chicken, which I was expecting to come in breast format. But instead, they give you a whole side of a chicken, and a cesear salad, which I enjoy a great deal. The chicken was well cooked, and the breast meat was tender and juicy. In all, the give the chicken 5 stars. The reason why I gave the restaurant 3 stars is because of the slow service. My friend order a simple club sandwhich which shouldn't take an hour long to make. We were about to finish our meals when the sandwhich finally came. Talk about long service.

Jim W.,"Chittenango, NY",49,6,,4.0,2/20/2011,"While visiting family in California I was really itching to visit a local brewery and try some of their craft brews. Truth be told this was not our first choice but it worked out well. My father in-law and I visited this location on a Saturday afternoon and sat at the bar. We decided to each try the beer sampler. I was surprised and pleased to see the size of the beers included in the sampler. The sampler features eight beers set on a mat which explains the characteristics of each. The beers ranged from a very light beer with about 3% ABV to their stout which was close to 9% ABV. The beers came in tall glasses which were about 4 ounces each. I thought the beers were good, but not fantastic. In fact, when we finished the sampler I didn't even order any of those beers, but instead ordered an Oktoberfest which was very, very good. The atmosphere is nice, and I would definitely try it again sometime.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=600

Markelle G.,"Whittier, CA",79,202,583,2.0,9/22/2009,"I have to agree with some of the other reviewers...it seems as though the service at BJs has slipped in recent months.  I went there with a group of co-workers to celebrate a birthday, and we were almost an hour and a half LATE getting back to work.  This is because the service was incredibly slow, and our food kept getting messed up.  One person found an unidentifiable hard object in her broccoli-cheese soup.  Another co-worker found a piece of bone in her chicken (which was supposed to be boneless, of course).  Yet another girl ordered a pizza, and it was so undercooked it had to be sent back...TWICE.  The same thing happened with another co-worker, who had meat that was so undercooked, it also had to be sent back.  My boss ordered a salad, and even though the waitress asked her what kind of chicken she wanted, the salad was delivered to the table without meat.  Keep in mind this all happened in ONE SITTING...ONE SINGLE MEAL.  At least the manager on duty was gracious, and comped our entire meal.  It was a disaster.  By the end of the lunch, we were so appalled, all we could do was shake our heads and laugh!  It was like something out of a bad movie.  A few weeks later, a handful of my (brave) co-workers made a return trip, and they had a similar experience.  Particularly with the pizza, it never seems to come out cooked.  The first time it was so doughy, it looked like it hadn't even been sent through the oven! I also have to echo the complaints about happy hour.  They will absolutely refuse to serve you drinks at happy hour prices, unless you're seated at the bar.  At least, that was MY experience.  It's frustrating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=600

We arrived on a rainy Sunday @ 5:00 pm - got great parking; seated pretty quick considering it's BJ's. Within an hour the place was packed which meant our service when downhill.

Then we wanted dessert but she just came and took our plates and then left for another 30 minutes. When we asked for the check she threw it on the table and left before we had a chance to make sure it had been divided up correctly. I had to call her over to fix a mistake on the check. She then attempted to fix it and 25 minutes later came back with the check. It was still wrong. When we alerted her she rolled her eyes at my friend and then walked away not saying anything. She was awful, and every server that I have had since going to this bj's at least 6 times, has been terrible. I am never going back again.

Aaron D.,"Anaheim, CA",421,415,27,4.0,2/11/2009,"BJ's Brewhouse. A lot of upsides and a few down.  This location has seemed far superior to the one in Huntington Beach. It has better seating. It has way way more room. The Parking is amazingly better. The service at this location has always been good for me.  Let it be said that BJ's is no Tap's or Yard. It really pales when compared to some of the other nicer brewery/beer oriented restaurants in Brea. If I was looking at this place on its own it would really shine a lot more than when comparing it to the other places available.  As for BJ's - I often avoid going there because I don't really like any of their appetizers. They are not awful they just also are not great. They need to work on more variety in the menu and on adding some complexity to their recipes.  Most bars can make the appetizers they are offering. The Lettuce wraps are pretty good. If you eat meat then the Angus sliders are ok. But, in general: the appetizers are not great. Appetizers don't make a restaurant; but if your a brewery you better work on your appetizers or people will eventually quit dropping in for a beer. They really need to consider adding a Calamari appetizer with a decent sauce.  As for the beer - I really enjoy the refreshing quality and flavor of the Brew house Blonde and the two varieties of Pale Ale. The Heifenweizen  at BJ's however has a nasty aftertaste. The Jeremiah red is fantastic. And the freshly brewed Root beer is worth trying. Its also delicious with ice cream as a dessert. A great way to go at BJ's is to order the beer sampler and try em out till you have a favorite.  On to Entrees. The Salmon is not very good. It could be that its because its farmed and from the Atlantic. Unfortunately many restaurants have not learned that cheap, farmed, crappy, Atlantic Salmon is not every going to taste elegant or amazing. Its going to taste like cheap, farmed, atlantic Salmon. The clam chowder is pretty tasty. They don't always consistently deliver it hot but when they do its wonderful. The Chardonnay Shrimp Pasta is delicious. They sometimes bring it out with some nasty bacon on top but other times they don't. And some people probably prefer some bacon on their pasta. But, the sauce is fantastic on it. The Jambalaya is pretty tasty here too. They occasionally have a Fish special that's tasty but most of the time they seem to think a lot more about red meat.  The Pizza can be pretty good depending on the night. They need to work on their consistency which is always an issue with chains.  They have a fantastic pazookie. Its a giant cookie with a nice scoop of ice cream served right in the middle of it. Its really a bit much for me but there is nothing wrong with that. So, overall this is a nice location. The food is pretty good. The beer is decent. It's way better than the Tustin Brewery. Its not quite what the Yard and Taps are however.  But, if your with a group and you want some beers and some grub - by all means go and enjoy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=620

The reason I am writing this is more for the atmosphere/service that was going on when my friends and I ate there last.  Our server did a great job getting our order and getting our food, except the dinner salad I ordered came out after my entree.   The real problem was the family behind us.  They had a young child, probably about 5 or 6 yrs old, maybe younger, I'm not sure, but the kid was going CRAZY!!!! Yelling, screaming, he even had a paper airplane he kept throwing and landing on our table and he kept coming over to grab it back.  Now I understand that kids will be kids, but this kid was way past that phase, and thats when parents or the STAFF need to do something.   I know the servers probably get more than enough complaints, but after asking to either be moved or have someone ask them to just stop being so loud, nothing happened.  Just imagine if that was the server and his friends eating next to that DEVIL CHILD and his inconsiderate family.

Kristine P.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",136,111,74,3.0,9/26/2009,"Need a place to meet up with good company coupled with great food? BJs is your best bet for great food and drinks. No matter what you order - baked potatoes, pizza, pasta, entrees, burgers, sandwiches, drinks - you get good portions that taste good. You basically get what you pay for IMO.  My favorites?  - Spinach and Artichoke Dip - Avocado Egg Rolls - Wedge Salad - Basalmic Glazed Chicken - Barbecue Chicken Pizza - Sweet Pig Pizza - Grilled Chicken Potato - Grilled Chicken Club Sandwich - Roasted Turkey Cobb Sandwich - Chocolate Chip Pizookie!  However, service will vary from location to location. I was here last Wednesday for my friend's birthday. One of her friends whom I have never met before had reserved a table before we arrived. I approached the hostess, telling her that we were there with a group under the friend's name. The hostess replied, ""Oh, you're here with a group? You can go ahead and walk around the restaurant and look for the group.""  I then explained to her that I had never met this person before, expecting the hostess to politely walk us over to the table. I mean, if a table is reserved, the table location should be programmed into the system right? Annoyed, I told her, ""Never mind, I'll just wait until the birthday girl gets here."" After 10 min of sitting in the waiting area, I guess she must've asked another co-worker about the reservation, so she approached us and said, ""Your party is at the big table in the corner."" Isn't it part of your job to seat us? I wasn't going to lose all hope in BJs just yet. Our server (I totally forgot his name) was VERY attentive and polite, probably the best service I've ever had at any BJs restaurant. At most locations I've been to, after the server brings you your order, you don't really see them until they bring you your check. This guy, however, was constantly checking up on our party of 6. One of our dishes came out undercooked, and he gladly had the dish redone. He also took the dish off the check because it took so long for it to be re-cooked.

Del L.,"Orange, CA",8,27,8,2.0,3/24/2009,"I have been a long time patron of BJ's restaurant/brewery in the Orange County area. BJ's has consistently delivered high quality food with excellent customer service. However, that has not been the case in the last month. Two weeks prior, my colleague found pieces of cellophane wrapping in her Ceaser salad. One week prior, my clam chowder was filled three quarters full compared to my other colleague's bowl. These minor problems were remedied quickly and appropriately. I understand mistakes happen, especially in a fast pace environment such as the ""lunch hour."" Nevertheless, the event which transpired two weeks passed on March 12, 2009, has served as a watershed moment for the rest of my professional colleagues and I. On that fateful Thursday, March 12, approximately 60 of my colleagues and I visited BJ's of Brea to celebrate two colleagues' birthdays. The restaurant/brewery had only a few other customers at the time. I do not believe we placed a heavy burden on the staff. We arrived during happy hour 4-7pm. We were declined happy hour pricing on our alcoholic beverages and appetizers, the waitress stated happy hour prices were only applicable to guests at the bar. There was no mention of this policy anywhere I was able to observe. The waitress however, did state we were able to buy alcoholic beverages at the bar, at happy hour prices.  Upon visiting the bar, the bartender stated he could not provide alcoholic beverages at happy hour prices because we were guests seated at the tables. This ""run-around"" type of customer service is inexcusable. More over, as I have stated previously, there is no mention of such strict happy hour policies printed where guess may access it readily. I do not appreciate such inconsistent discriminating policies.  The service was incredibly slow. Mind you, I understand we had a rather large group. But as I have stated previously, there were only a few other patrons at the time. The staff size should have been adequate enough to service our party well, but it was woefully not. To ad insult to injury, the waitress refused to ""split the check."" I cannot comprehend how a large restaurant such as BJ's cannot split the bill for 60 adults. It was not an unreasonable request. We cordially spoke to the manager on duty about our concerns and grievances. He promptly reiterated it is policy and he cannot do anything about the matter. ""Deplorable and incomprehensible"" was my reply. I would like to remind you all of BJ's Gold Standard, ""Our genuine commitment is to take pride in passionately connecting with every guest, on every visit, through flawless and relentless execution of every detail during every shift - to create and keep fanatical fans of BJ's concept and brand."" I observed none of the Gold Standard during our birthday celebration on March 12.  I will add that I am also a patron of the Yardhouse. The Yardhouse does not have limiting policies regarding happy hour availability to guests seated anywhere. The Yardhouse is more than happy to accommodate large parties. In fact we recently had another birthday celebration yesterday, March 23. The Yardhouse was more than obliging to ""split the check."" Comparing BJ's services to other restaurants and businesses, I have come to the conclusion BJ's does not appreciate business during a recession. I have also come to the conclusion money speaks louder than words and my colleagues, family, friends, and I shall no longer patronize BJ's restaurant/brewery. Two Stars, because I am a generous person and I believe BJ's can still turn themselves around if they are willing to listen to customers and make appropriate changes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=620

My friend and I split a medium cheese pizza, which was enough for the both of us. We also ordered some garlic cheese bread and some pizookies.  Okay, so the garlic cheese bread was just french bread with herbs on it. The pizza tasted like bland Pizza Hut pizza, had almost no sauce on it, and wasn't even really deep dish.. but the pizookie which is a deep dish  cookie was warm and chewy and delicious but took longer than our pizzas to come out..

I have been here a bunch and have always had a good experience. I have tried a wide variety of things on the menu, the pizzas are really good! I've also had all the micro brews they offer. My personal favorites are the Jeremiah Red and the Brewhouse Blonde. My friend ordered a pitcher of Jeremiah Red for the cute boys at the next table and it was a hit. Previous to yesterday, I had only seen that done in cheesy movies , but it works folks! If you're a beer person, such as myself, they have beer appreciation night the 1st Tuesday of every month at 7:30, for 18 dollars. So worth the money! My friend and i started off out meal yesterday with the Lettuce wrap ($8.95) appetizer which was great. One of the sauces was a little gross so I just stuck with the other one. We both got Margaritas which we agreed weren't super impressing. Not to mention they were 7.25$, only .70cents cheaper then our lunch specials. whack! We got the lunch special which included half a sandwich, a salad , and french fries. Pretty good deal is you ask me, super filling! I got the turkey  cobb sandwich which i recommend! You can't really go wrong with anything you order here. Another thing I feel worth mentioning is that have ""Curbside service"" you can order ahead and they'll bring it to your car.

Rob B.,"Yorba Linda, CA",0,11,,2.0,9/12/2010,"It occurred to me last night who the ideal customer is for BJs.  I had plenty of time to think about it, because we called to get a reservation, which they don't give, but we were told to get there by 6:00 and there would be no problem--which in all fairness, it probably WASN'T a problem for them that we were seated 35 minutes later...  But it DID end up being a problem for them that we got our two simple pizzas 45 minutes later.   I used the large aluminum pizza dish off a neighboring table like a giant frisbee/ninja star to get the attention (take off the leg) of our server, who hobbled off bleeding and dying to get the manager.  When the manager came crawling up on hands and knees ducking his unfortunate head and jabbering incoherently about mercy, we cut his noggin off with a butterknife and sent it back to the kitchen  on a pizzookie plate with a napkin taped to his nose that said ""PIZZA--NOW.  Table 8"". Actually, most of that just happened in my head while we were waiting for our food, I'm pretty sure.  But I still do believe we are all only one late-pizza-step away from being mass murderers some days.   So the manager was nice about us having to wait 1 hour and 20 minutes total to get our food, and took about $15.00 off our $45.00 total bill.  More importantly, he apologized profusely and sincerely in grand style, which I valued at about $30.00 so in effect we ate for free and he got to live. Dinner and a show on a budget.  A win win.  Of course my daughter got to the game an hour late, and she wasn't going to be paying the bill anyway, so it was probably a win-win-lose.  Ok, and the other people with her who were in the same boat, so the final count was probably, win-win-lose-lose-lose-lose-lose. The ideal customer?  The guy who is on a first and probable last date with a girl out of his league.  Assuming she's only going out with him because she's hungry, she won't say no when the hostess tells him it'll be 15 minutes, nor will she leave 20 minutes later when the hostess says it'll be 10 to 12 minutes longer, and when they're seated 15 minutes after that, she'll be so relieved to finally be sitting at the table with a menu with stomach growling that wild cannibals couldn't remove her from your presence.  And the waiter is on your side, dude.  Small talk, oozing around the tables, hey maybe a salad, hey maybe some appetizers, cool; whoops forgot the salad, I'm on it dude...  There's never a moment when she realizes she's going to be with you for THREE HOURS to eat a pizza til it's over.  Of course, it's BJs deep dish, and it's good pizza.  So there's that too.  And beer.  More beer than you can drink.  Maybe by the time she's finally full of both, she finds you more attractive than a white chocolate macademia nute pizzookie.  Maybe my cat will speak Latin.  You never know. My three best tips to you, ideal customer of BJ's, is (1) to come with a list of conversation topics, (2) letting her know you are an 'acquired taste'; and (3) if she still isn't convinced after 3 hours of tasting you,first get your server's attention by grabbing the pizza tin . . .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=660

Unexpectedly, on the day of my birthday celebration, my dad was hospitalized from a heart attack, which goes without saying, caused a setback in plans that day. I called ahead to notify the hostess and she mentioned a 15 minute leeway. I show up 3 minutes later than the leeway time and the hostess Kayla coldly explains that they gave up my reservations and despite my circumstances, there was nothing she would or could do. (This was the same hostess who coldly refused to greet my dad and me the week before.) Truthfully, such rude service and lack of flexibility in the face of the most extreme unfortunate circumstances makes me never want to visit this restaurant ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=660

Susan N.,"Santa Ana, CA",21,67,149,3.0,3/27/2008,"Actually, i've been here before several times but this recent visit that I had just the other night compelled me to have to write a review for it.   I discovered that they have chili cheese fries which is quite yummy!!! I usually only like non-shredded cheese (the nacho cheese kind of cheese) but for this particular appetizer, the cheese was really good.  It is basically potato wedges smothered with melted shredded cheese with chili topped with sour cream and chives.  I loved how the cheese stayed melted and didn't dry up so fast. Must try that when you go there!  If you like pizzas, I'd suggest the Great White as first choice.  It is deep dish pan pizza with lots of carbs so if you don't want a lot of flour, then you won't like this. It is very filling.  My friends and I had pizza, spinach artichoke dip, and chili cheese potato wedges with a pitcher of Berry Cider.   The dip - don't get it, it isn't all that great and they serve more chips than they do dip.  Dip doesn't come portioned to the size of chips that are served.   If you want good dip, I love RED ROBIN'S Spinach Artichoke dip. Yum!  Dessert- I am not a sweet eater but OMG the white macadamian (if that's how you spell it) pazookie with vanilla ice cream is to die for! That's amazing to me being that I am not into sweets at all. I loved the softness of the cookie. We ordered the ice cream to be separate instead of on top of the cookie.  They gipped us on our ice cream portion though but all in all, great dessert. Just talking about it makes me want some!  Last thing - Service is terrible here.  We waited a long time to get our check and getting our change too so we just left cash instead since the wait was too long. I don't think it's the entire place, it's just our waiter was terrible. Darn it, I forgot his name!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=660

The pizza was clearly not cooked, the dough was still raw and the cheese was not melted. It looked horrible. The bad customer service just topped it off.

Carl A.,"Fullerton, CA",3,23,,3.0,2/18/2011,"We went to BJ's for a casual burger after the lunch crowd had left so it would be leisurely. We had service that was friendly. The California Burger was juicy and tasty with avocado and green chilies. It comes with a choice of thin or thick fries. I chose the thin and my wife chose thick, both of which were tasty and flavorful. The drawbacks were the chips and salsa, the waiter forgetting to refill water glasses, and stale chips. The salsa had an off putting flavor, to me. The wife said it wasn't great but it was OK. The waiter said that he would bring fresh chips but I guess he forgot. It couldn't have been the customers that took his attention because they were minimal. And I guess he figured that we had enough water for the day. They didn't forget the check though. Now I must admit that we were there for a tasty burger (half pound) and that came to us beautifully but there are other things that go with service and they did not live up to what they could have done. I dislike having to continually remind the wait staff that they have forgotten something. BJ's is where I go for quick and tasty food and I will go to this one again to see if this was a fluke (it is not the first time it has happened at BJ's). Don't get me wrong, I am not complaining over water. I am complaining because the wait staff is not as attentive and proactive as it could be. After all, that is part of the fee for eating anywhere. You pay a fee for not having to get up to serve yourself. BJ's is suppose to make you comfortable not cause you to find your particular waiter among a sea of others to ask for service.

Steven R.,"Chicago, IL",53,461,2,4.0,12/31/2007,"I know, I know; it's a chain. However, this is one chain I will proudly admit patronizing because they are one of the few chain restaurants that appeal to something I consider a food group: beer.  Yeah, not in a fat mid-westerner or frat boy way, but I like beer.  I'm not talking a 12 pack of Bud Light as much as I'm talking a few micro brews or some Belgian ales.  BJ's has both. The food is decent.  It is self-described as comfort food, which I guess works.  They have meatloaf, pot roast and chicken.  The pizza is tasty although comes with a lot of bread.  The burgers and sandwiches are all pretty good, especially my favorites the blackened chicken sandwich.  Another plus is that they have two happy hours, one of which runs during a time when you might actually be drinking anyway, Sun. - Thurs., 10pm - Close.  Also I know you used to be able to get 6-packs of the BJs brews although I'm not sure if you still can. The beers are all outstanding.  This particular BJ's is an actual brewery, so besides having the standard lineup of BJs beers, they have a few exclusive brews like their Sesame Wheat, different Pale Ales, a barley wine variety, Oktoberfest, Pumpkin Ale, and even a cask ale which is usually the oak pale ale.  They all have weird/random names so I can't really remember them and they get rotated out.  Add this to the fact that they carry Sierra Nevada varieties according to season (Bigfoot Ale) and an array of bottled Belgium beers, and it's usually hard for me to leave this place before closing time.  One of the best things is the monthly beer tasting night.   For about $18 a head, you get to taste about 13 different beers and you usually get a free beer glass from one of the featured breweries.  After it's all over, they'll usually let you buy pints or bottles of the leftover for like $2 or so.  The lectures can be a little rough at times but overall it's a good experience as each month has a different theme like ""winter warmers"" or ""wheat beers"", etc.  Yes, you can smile or ask nicely and a server might pour you a little extra sample.  It probably doesn't sound like much for the money, but trust me, the only way you won't get wasted is if you don't swallow each sample. Probably the most annoying thing is the bar area, where you're at your wait person's mercy for beer refills unless you have cash for the bar.  Beyond this, I love coming to eat here knowing I can have something besides the boring ol' Heineken, Guinness, Pyramid lineup of most chains.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=660

I came with two friends. It took a while for our server to ask us for drinks. Once she came, we all ordered water with a request to have a lemon put in it. She brought out the water.. without lemons and said she'll be right back with the lemons. Again, she came back and took our orders without the lemon. I could let the lemon go, it was not that big of a deal. When she took our order, one of my friends ordered her salad with dressing on the side and to take out the fried onions on top because she's allergic. When her food came out, they totally forgot to even include the dressing on the side and there were fried onions on top of her salad. We didn't want to make a big deal out of it so she just asked her if she can get the dressing as she took out the onions by herself. The biggest thing that got me was that there were no utensils on the table when we arrived and we had to ask for them after our food had already come out. It wasn't a bad dining experience, I just wish the server was more prepared so we didn't have to call her so often to get something for us. Plus, I didn't get my water refilled because she never came back after she told she would come back with water.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=680

Carolyn M.,"Cypress, CA",11,18,,4.0,1/17/2009,"BJ's is your typical Sports Bar and Grill type place. Even if the lay out is different, once you've been to one - you've been to them all. It's loud (w/ people and music) and it can generally be pretty crowded. The wait staff is only so/so and I think this is b/c it's comprised mostly of college students. So, don't go for the atmosphere - go for the food. I prefer ""regular"" or New York style pizza but Chicago style (or ""deep dish"") has it's merits. It's much more filling, more of a meal. The fact that it's messy to hold makes you want to dig in w/ a fork and knife - go ahead, that's pretty traditional in the Chicago area.  The ""menu pizzas"", as I call them, are the pizzas that come w/ toppings created by the chef and christened w/ some kind of name (Hawaiian, Meat Lovers, etc.). These are pretty Good. The toppings make sense and are generally well portioned. You could also make your own, which i suggest doing more often than not. The other menu items are Good but a little odd: meatloaf? Who the hell serves meatloaf? And Pot Roast! I haven't had that in, like, 15 years! I wonder how often these items are ordered...Anyway, suffice to say that there are MANY choices to make from this menu. Which is a little annoying for me but will be a blessing for those who don't care for the pizza. All the salads are Good - EXCEPT for the Sesame Chicken Salad. I had a good laugh looking at the menu recently, when I noticed that the salad was described as ""unforgettable."" ACTUALLY, it's very forgettable - in fact, just forget that it's even there on the menu. The salad is bland, watery and overdressed w/ salad dressing. Try the Cobb, it's way better. The sandwiches are also generally Good. And they all come w/ your choice of seasoned (think Jack in the Box) thick-cut fries or crispy shoe-string. I suggest you order one style and you lunch mate orders the other so you can compare notes (I like them both, so it's Sofie's Choice for me!) When it comes to desserts, I am no wallflower. I will eat just about anything - happily. The Handcrafted Root Beer Float is AMAZING. BJ's makes it's own root beer, so you know you are in for a treat. And the vanilla bean ice cream they serve on it is rich and creamy. Now, the ""famous"" Pazookie (I hate that name) is OK. A lot of people will go on and on about it but I say Whatever. It's a cookie baked in a deep dish pan, topped w/ vanilla bean ice cream. The ice cream is better than the cookie. The poor thing comes out uneven and gooey in the middle but crispy (greasy?) on the outside. It doesn't help that the ice cream instantly starts to melt and makes the cookie soggy. What you'll want to do is come here with a couple of friends that enjoy sports. Order some very tasty beers and a nice selection of appetizers. Then, sit back and enjoy your afternoon/evening. Don't go on a Sunday after church hours - there will be a swarm of old ladies, babies, kids, frazzled mothers and depressed dads sucking the life out of the joint.

The only thing I come here for is the pizookies! the cookie with the icecream is absolutely a perfect way to end a dinner. I've had the bbq chicken pizza here which was pretty alright, not bad. I've also tried the chicken marsala which was pretty good too, chicken was kind of dry but the sauce kind of made up for it and the mash potato's that came with it was pretty good too. This place is alright, I've had it alot for friends dinner parties and a few times with my beau but other than that I didn't and wouldn't really want to go back there.

Rony H.,"Orange County, CA",15,138,,3.0,10/21/2008,"We had the mini pizza and bjs cobb salad--it was very good.  The pizza was moist on the inside and a bit crispy on the outside.  I think the crust could have been a wee bit more crispy, but the flavor was totally fine.  The cobb salad had enough of each ingredient: the crutons were perfect-- not too hard where it cuts the roof of your mouth and not too uncooked where it tastes like flour.  The lettuce was fine (not like totally crispy but good enough) and the bacon and other ingredients were good. I wish they would hire more professional staff.  The girl manning the seating chart was totally cool, but the guy showing us the seat was kind of airheady.  we asked him if we could sit near the outer rim of the seating since it was such a nice day and he told us ""oh, there's a big group reserved there"" without checking to see.  so we gave up but not a few minutes later, did the pretty older white ladies who walked in behind us sit where we had asked to be reseated!  my guy and i just kind of looked at each other...only a certain race of people sat in the seats where people can see from the parking lot.  so we asked the waitress (when she came to us) to be seated by the outer rim of the patio...she hmmed and mmmed for a good while and reseated us but forevermore had an air of attitudiness.  we just wanted to enjoy the weather!!  the waitress we had (i wont name namesrachael) asked us at the end of the meal if we wanted a pizookie, and since i didn't hear what she said, I asked, a what? she answered "" a pizookie"". and it was silent for a few seconds and she didn't elaborate like we were supposed to know what that was.  sadly to say, my first experience here with the people didn't turn out well as i really enjoyed the food.  they have a flatscreen tv in the patio so if you want to watch the game (like it was on Sunday) it will add to the enjoyment.  perhaps i can try another bjs.  really loved the food there....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=700

I decided to come in on a Sunday to give this place a try since they have many selection of Deep Dish Chicago Style Pizzas. I went inside to order a Vegetarian only with only Mushrooms and Tomatoes Chees piazza. The guy took my order looked clueless, and also counting his tips infront of me.. acting like he's a big shot for some reason. Then he gave me the receipt and i sat down to wait for my pizza. I waited for 20-30 minutes, and it was busy inside and no one seems to care why i'm sitting down. then i got up around 40 minutes and asked the manager in glasses, for my piazza. he then went into the back and 5 minutes later a different person brought me the pizza. I opened the pizza expecting my order again with mushrooms and tomatoes. but there were pepperoniza, meatballs, and mushrooms on my pizza.

Their gold beer is good too, and easiest to drink while scarfing food in your face. The service is awesome as well; ask and you shall receive.

They took like 4 pizzas home)!  The garden salad was fresh, crisp, and delicious.  The pizzas were fantastic!  YUM!  Servers were out on the patio all the time bringing drinks and taking away dirty/finished dishes.  It was a great experience and I would definitely recommend BJ's for any large event like this!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-brea-2?start=700

Then after 30 min, he stated that they had to remake it since it was burned. I asked to see the pizza, and he stated it was thrown away. I also had to ask to see the manager twice before he came to our table.  He was very apologetic and comped our pizza.  But when the pizza finally came, it was cold so I had to have them reheat it.

That's ok, mistakes happen and it was probably the chefs fault not the waiters. Then he brings out my margarita. I took a sip, looked down at it and saw a dead fly floating around. I almost gagged. So then I tell the server and he brings me another one. I would think he would  have given the margarita drink complimentary after that, but he did not. I was not a bitch at all about it but I probably should have been. Sometimes i hate being a nice person. Whatever. I ended up tipping 15% instead of my normal 20%. Not that he even deserved that!
