Chris S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,2,1.0,1/1/2018,"Honestly this is the 3rd or 4th time this place has let me down. I came last time and the same waiter messed up my friends drink and switched it with a couple that was behind us, only reason we knew it was her drink, because there was lipstick on my friends drink. Then we told the waiter ""hey this is the wrong drink, it's not my drink"" he said its your drink and began walking away. So that was like in September 2017 idk what day. I kept it cool cause I like bj's but TODAY IM WRITING A REVIEW BECAUSE I CAME IN AND GOT THE SAAAAAAAAAAAMEEEE DUDE.!!.! Like bro quit alrdy.... right off the back I knew it was him.. stayed quiet and told my girlfriend about it. So I ordered a burger then I got my food and asked the server who brought it, hey can I get some ranch, he ignored me and I saw him help somebody else. Ok that was annoying and I'm waiting nearly 15mins after getting my food with no refill or ranch. So I drank my girlfriends water and ate my food then this dude still has the NERVE to bring me RANCH.?!?!? All I gotta say is I'm NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER COMING BACK.!!

For appetizers we had bbq chicken wings and avocado rolls that were delicious.  My entree was the spaghetti & meatballs -- yeah I was impressed' Very large portion that I finished the remainder for lunch today.

But you just do not stand up to the test of time. First of all, this location has valet parking for $4.50 and they drove my car two parking spaces to park it. That annoys me.  We had to wait 30 minutes for a table and they didn't even seem that busy. Once we did sit, our server was nowhere to be found, CONSISTENTLY. My husband ordered the prime rib special and that was a mistake. The prime rib was incredibly over cooked and dry, and the sides were lacking in flavor. I had the BBQ deep dish pizza and it was also bland. We then ended with a chocolate chips pizookie which I was SO SURE was going to be amazing, because it's a hot cookie with ice cream, so how can you mess that up? Well it turns out you can serve a lukewarm cookie and it kinda just kills the whole vibe.  Also, because of the slow service and disappearing waiter, the whole meal took over 2 hours.

As I was eating my pork chops I notice the farther I ate to the center the more raw it got. At this point I did talk to the waitress and she said after she talked to the cook that they cook it to 165° and if you want it cooked more you must request it?

I ordered a mini size pizza for pickup and even though it was ready shortly before I arrived, I still had to wait 20 minutes before they would give it to me, so it was cold by the time I actually got to eat it.

Jerald R.,"Sunnyvale, CA",178,1,2,1.0,11/7/2017,"Absolutely horrible. I placed my order via DoorDash and received an email from DoorDash stating the restaurant had confirmed my order at 6:37p. Delivery was scheduled for 7:41p. And at around 7:46 I wasn't even showing the dasher at the restaurant so I texted to be sure everything was okay. They said they were picking it up. I contacted customer support and the dasher texted saying the restaurant claimed the order was never placed and it would be a few minutes. By then it was 8p. 20 minutes after it was supposed to have been delivered. The customer support rep tried calling the restaurant and was placed on hold for an ungodly amount of time while my poor dasher was stuck waiting there. Finally the rep gets back with me at 8:40p and informs me the restaurant is not even going to fill the order, and that the dasher said there were many people waiting. TWO HOURS after I placed the order and an HOUR after it was supposed to be here.  My dasher waited at the restaurant for over half an hour - i wouldnt even have to wait that long for my food if Id gone there to eat in person!!! IT'S a TUESDAY night!!! Even in person on a weekend - no matter how busy you are I would never have had to wait 30mins after i ordered let alone TWO HOURS to receive my food. Absolute shittiest service.

We finished eating and it took the waitress another 20 minutes to come take our dessert order. The pizookie came out cold and hard.

Jay W.,"Rowland Heights, CA",144,1,,1.0,1/1/2018,"So me and my friends go to Bj's for food after universal and this was the closest one. We've been to BJs before and we thought it was great so we just hopped over to this one because we were starving. This was undeniably the worst decision of the night. Keep in mind we're just a group of four college kids and wanted food. The first thing that happened was the cups they brought out were plastic. At first we thought it was just like whatever but we looked around and someone ordered a drink so I thought that was why they got a glass. But after looking more I found that everyone else who ordered water got a glass except for us. The waitress came back and explained there were no cups left and that was fine until the party who just sat down right after us got their water and it was in a glass. Second when our food came out my friend and I ordered the exact same thing but the difference was that his platter had the full dish on it while mines had 4 pieces of broccoli and noodles. I searched underneath to look for the rest and found none so I called the waitress and I was surprised to see her serving the table behind me. I made sure she saw my hand raised for help and thought that she would come after only she left for a couple more minutes before coming back. Alright so whatever that's all fine. But once she came and. I notified her that there was barely any broccoli while showing her (literally moving it all around and lifting the noodle) she said ""oh it's under the noodle"". To which I just lifted it again and asked her if I could have more. I thought this would be the end of the trouble but after she brought back my plate of food and I began to eat I discovered a clump of undercooked pasta in it. I thought it was just me being picky but I wasn't feeling like finishing so I asked my friend if he wanted the rest and he ate it and said it tasted funny and that the other one that was brought out tasted a lot better. At this point I gave up on the dish and just wanted to leave except my friends wanted to get a pizookie so I just went along with it. Only when we ordered the pizookie we asked for a refill on the water. Only the refill never came and for that matter, no one ever came around to offer us a refill on our plastic cups of water. That's the end of my story of the night. Hopefully this was just a minor problem because their a new startup(according to yelp) but if I were to be honest, the only reason I gave a 1 is because yelp won't let me give them a 0.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=20

So we just assumed not alot of servers to cover the whole area. So we waited and waited and waited... and we finally got called after 30mins.:)  Food: Great white Deepdish pizza 14in. - dont expect Chicago deep dish. It's ok. a bit salty. Enough to feed 5 people with 2 slices for leftovers. Avocado roll - my favorite dish! 2 rolls had the spicy taste to it.. some just had plain avocado. i remember it being really good but today it was ok. I mean... i'd order it again.. today just felt off maybe? Calamari - crunchy good ol' calamari. Deep it in marinara. Yum.:)  Shrimp and asparagus pasta - bland. we smothered it with cheese and crushed red peppers. Had like 3-5 pcs of shrimp? Dry and a bit undercooked. Will probably not order this again.

He was very friendly and efficient with us and we were glad to have him take care of us. Originally we were seated by the smaller bar in a smaller 2-top booth, but we were uncomfortably warm sitting there so we asked if it was possible to move to a different spot (in which case we were moved to a bigger booth close by with a much better & comfortable temperature.  We were told about the 2 for $25 deal so we pursued it and Adam was very willing to explain what we could get. We ordered the 2 salads, a medium pepperoni w/ jalapeños and bacon, and a Cookies N' Cream pizookie. All of it was amazing and it only came out to $25 plus tax. Of course had to get a pitcher of their delicious Brewhouse Blonde Pale ale so our bill came out to roughly $47 or so.  I was a little disappointed in finding out that I wasn't credited my BJs rewards points as I had asked, but maybe I will contact the restaurant in hopes to getting them back, haha.

After a long day at universal studios ( private party ), we decided to chill back at the hotel and grab some food to go , luckily ( we thought ) bjs was right across the street ? We placed an online order and were awaiting a confirmation email as it said one would be arriving soon ......after a minute or 2 no email arrived so we called,they said they received order , so I started walking across street , upon arrival there was no one at podium or take out area and I was told by other guests who were waiting for take out as well that the girl would be back,I went to restroom to wash up and coming out still no one who worked there, after a few more minutes the girl came back and brought out the other guests food and apparently my order, which was quoted as 15/20 minutes from the time we hung up the phone at this point it was only about 10minutes from hotel, waiting and bathroom break , the takeout girl asked if I was picking up and I gave my name  and she says order was ready , I was ""wow cool!"" Than she says that we were just waiting on the queso dip, I did place an extra order for milk and extra pzookie, which she said should come out together, once again cool, she said it was just going to be a moment,after a few minutes the manager came out and said they were out of queso , and if I would like something else because they were closing soon, I decided on spinach dip , then she said it would be out soon then after a few minutes more I got spinach dip and pzookie, the girl forgot the milk and I had to wait a few more moments for that ! By the time I got back to room about 35 minutes had gone by , for an order that was mostly ready when I got there !! Wtf ?? Anyway back at the room, we opened food that was either cold ( spinach dip and sliders ) or burnt ( pzookie) , there was no ketchup for fries and all in all it was a very disappointing experience !!

We came in a larger group (12-15 people) for my friends birthday and our waiter whom resembled josh from drake and josh was EXTREMELY RUDE and INCONVENIENT. He fat shamed my friend for ordering two meals and judged her for the amount of food she was eating  and made her feel bad. This establishment then took over two hours to bring out all of our food and then when my friend accidentally spilled her drink trying to reach food from him he became extremely annoyed and angry. He then CHARGED US AN INCONVENIENCE FEE of $45 all because he has a rude temper. I will post a photo of him.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=20

Singris B.,"Burbank, CA",38,37,23,1.0,9/4/2017,"I used to frequent this location, but within the last 2 years my 3 visits were a bit disappointing.  FOOD: the quality of the food is nothing like it used to be, I used to order the Parmesan chicken or fettuccini Alfredo, they were made to perfection, and ALWAYS hit the spot. Well not anymore! Not sure why the Parmesan chicken has dry tomatoes sprinkled over it now, still a bit pink and bland! The mashed potatoes used to be covered in a delicious sauce, not anymore.  It seems like they cut back on a lot, especially the warm delicious complimentary bread and butter they used to serve. We were super hungry so we ordered bread to eat while we waited. cost (5.99), but our food got there first! So it was pointless and we canceled it. The grilled chicken pasta, is not what it used to be. It taste like pieces of chicken that were frozen, warmed up and tossed over pasta. Not the fresh off the Grill tasting chicken Over a creamy Alfredo pasta I remember! I won't get started with the pizza =(  WAIT TIME: took way too long to get our food considering it wasn't busy. We were seated right away, and there were plenty of empty tables. How ever, it took about 40 min to get served! And when you have a 2 year old with you, it seems like an eternity!  The waiter seemed like he could use a break, it Took way TOO long to get our drinks/refills.

My personal opinion is that the poor customer contact, neglectful table service, and dirty premises at the Burbank location is most likely a reflection of bad management (the staff trying their best under poor leadership).  The manager was condescending and dismissive.  We will return to Glendale and Santa Clarita, but definitely not to Burbank.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=60

Third, my friend and i both ordered the Chicken alfredo... it came out (30 min later) looking like only pasta with raw broccoli on top. Neither of us were given alfredo sauce.. and the food looked as if it had been sitting for quite some time before being brought out to us:/  We were so hungry we decided to only ask for more sauce instead of returning the entire plate. 10 long min later after asking our server to bring a side of sauce, we get only ONE side instead of 2.  It was terrible and the broccoli was crunchy and entire plate was cold after everything.

Shirley T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,17,16,1.0,6/9/2017,"So am writing this review as we leave the restaurant. There are a couple of things that went wrong with today and most of it has to do with the long wait and service. I would normally not mind such things but it is different when I see the staff chatting and having personal conversation among each other and several empty tables. First we put or name in for a table with the girl at the front and was told 15 minutes, no problem. Then as we are sitting there with no one else waiting, it seems the girl at the host table leaves and the gentleman takes her place but not before chatting it up for about 15 minutes. We continue to wait another 10 minutes or so and the gentleman asks us if we are waiting for take out. I tell him no and that we are waiting for a table. He then says ""omg why did no one tell me, let me get you a table"". Apparently the girl didn't notify him of our wait.  Once we get a table we sit there and look at the menu without getting acknowledgement. Normally I wouldn't mind especially if it is busy but we had quite a few tables around us that were empty. We figure out what we all want to order and are still waiting. By this time a little less than 10 minutes have passed. Our waiter then comes over and tells us he will be right with us. Then a few minutes pass and another group gets seated next to us. The waiter goes to them and gets their drink orders while we are still waiting with no drinks or having put any orders in. We then see the waiter go in and out of the kitchen several times and stop to have personal conversation with coworkers. By this time it has been a little under 15 minutes of just sitting at the table totaling about 40 minutes. By this time we were done and angry so we walked out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=60

To my knowledge, today being busy was the perfect opportunity to make him a great server. He kept the drinks flowing without even asking and told us about the daily specials they offered.

Destiny P.,"Las Vegas, NV",87,15,5,1.0,9/28/2017,"My boyfriend and I were staying in Burbank on vacation at a nearby hotel close to the BJs Burbank location and decided to get takeout from there one night since we had a coupon. I ordered the prime rib dip with white cheddar mashed potatoes and my boyfriend got the sliders with French fries. The girl ringing us up was very friendly and accommodating. However, when we got back to the hotel to eat I was unpleasantly surprised. My prime rib dip was bright red in some spots and then gray in others. It looked extremely unappetizing. To top it off my mashed potatoes had MOLD on them. Yes, mold. I immediately contacted the restaurant and waited on hold several minutes to speak with a manager. I explained to him the situation and even offered to bring the food back. He then argued with me and said that they cook their prime rib to medium rare and if I brought it back he could cook it longer for me if I wanted. I said I would just prefer a refund and he said in order for me to get a refund I'd have to come back and he would have to reauthorize a charge for the entire meal on my card again (which would come off who knows when) and then I would get a refund (who knows when). I declined and he said he'd have his manager email me a gift card in, also, an undefined amount of days. I am now disgusted, without dinner, and without a refund.

So when we saw the ad again and called to find out how come we didn't get the deal that was advertised on TV, the manager Mark said that it's because they are not allowed to advertise an ad that is on TV in person because they have so many coupons going on and we had to say the specific deal to get it.

Who would say no to a BOGO free offer? Not me so I'm in for another visit and tag along a coworker to share the promo.  We were promptly greeted and led to our table. Although there were several tables in the front, we were assigned a table to at the farthermost section where the bar is so we requested a table nearer the main dining area. They obliged without any objection. We ordered a salmon quinoa bowl ($12.50) and a chicken pesto pizza ($15.50). The salmon was crispy on the outside but juicy in the inside. The quinoa and the vegetables were also perfectly cooked. The same goes with the pizza which came with chicken, tomatoes and artichoke. We really enjoyed both the meal so we finished them all. The restaurant is huge and has many tables divided in different sections to give privacy to diners. Customer service is always great every time I come here. The only reason I took off one star is the issue with valet parking. I would fully understand if there's limited parking but on the contrary, there is a huge inside parking lot.

Finally our waiter came...I asked for the Santa Fe Spring Roll...he said they don't have that on their menu anymore.  #Fail So we just ended up ordering our food. 48 min later we get our food.

Waiter wasn't all that great. Checked up once in the 2 hours we were there. I say 2 hours because the first 48 min we waited for our food.

I thought it was actually a bit too dry (I did get the medium well) but it seemed like it was well done because some parts of the steak was burnt. I really enjoyed the tomato Bisque and their fries were also really good. For $15, I thought it was well worth it. Service was really slow. We asked our server if she knew what the letters ""BJ"" stood for (we were not trying to be gross) and her response was, ""it's not what you think it is..""

Toni D.,"Studio City, CA",10,15,3,3.0,1/1/2017,"Where do I start? I'm going to be generous and give this place a 3 because of it being New Year's Day, when in reality a 2 would suffice.  The service: From the very beginning at the hostess stand was below mediocre. There was a 20-25 minute wait that turned into a 35 min wait. That's not the problem. There were at least 12 tables open yet 20 people waiting to be seated. None of the 4 people at the hostess stand had a welcoming attitude. Then I noticed people after me were being set first. Annoying.  The waitress: For whatever reason the waitress had a new hire shadowing her (the standards must be really low). She was sweet but not great at what she does. But then again maybe she was just busy.... but still you're a waitress. Another waitress had to bring me silverware and she acted as if I'd ruined her day.  Outside of taking my order, she checked on me once which I then asked for my check. It took 10 minutes to get it. Then I have her my card right away... another 10 mins. It was really difficult to only tip her 20% of the check (because it was a $25 check). I normally would leave at least 50% if not a 100% tip for such a small check (especially since it's the holidays).  The guy shadowing though, seems like he will be great at serving. He came by a few times on his own accord while walking by following the other waitress.  The food: While didn't expect a Michelin experience the food was very basic and tasted like something from a cafeteria. My 9 year old said that this place deserved only 2 stars because of the long wait and basic tasting food.  Anyway... I'm sure there's an excuse for the experience I had, but unfortunately I won't ever be back to find out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=80

We had to ask for the two remaining drinks, one water and one strawberry lemonade. Explanation, they had to get the lemonade from the back. But how long does it take to get water. We had a coupon for a free appetizer and two gift cards. We ordered two deserts which they comped because of the slow service. I reminded them of the free appetizer when I gave them the gift cards. I estimated the amount of the check, when I got it back I owed $16, but they could not get the one gift card to work because of system issues. The amount was higher than I expected, I asked for the check, was handed the wrong one, we were a table of three adults and I was handed a check with kids meals on it. I finally got the check and saw they had not take off the appetizer. We went over the check, the free appetizer and the one gift card, we estimate a credit of $4. I left an $8 additional tip.

I wish the quality of the food was as good as the quality of the staff.   The spinach cheese dip was hard as a rock. Dip should be soft and luscious, not something you have to smash with your fork before you can eat it. Plus, it came in a ramekin so small, you could barely share it with anyone. They have great tortilla chips, but they all broke off in the dip because it was like cement. And the dip needs salsa on the side, because it's quite bland The little $5.50 salad I had with it was okay. Decent ranch dressing. I would eat that again.  The prices are reasonable. Valet parking, and free self-parking upstairs in their parking lot.  The restroom was stinky and gross, with paper towels falling out of the trash can, which looked like it hadn't been emptied in a while. Do clean restrooms matter?

(Which was to be expected on this momentous day) As it was, the main bar was full so we had to wait. My husband got antsy 10 minutes into our wait and decided to explore the restaurant... and he found a second bar! (There is actually another bar inside the restaurant area) We asked the host and he said yes, we can seat ourselves at that bar as well. Once seated we were greeted by Rebecca who said,  ""Thanks for deciding to join me tonight guys."" Right away we knew we had made the right choice. Her bright smile, welcoming personality, and charisma made us feel right at home. While perusing the menu I couldn't find the stuffed baked potatoes. Rebecca assured me that they do still have then on the menu, they are just on the lunch menu now. I was elated, since I had been craving that dish for weeks, and was looking forward to finally getting to go to BJ's so I could have it.   Throughout our meal Rebecca was very attentive and always there whenever we needed anything.  Towards the end of our meal we overheard a regular asking our server how she liked married life. So when she returned to our table we inquired if she is newly married? She told us that she just got married in May. We informed her our wedding was just 3 weeks ago. We congratulated eachother and it was a bonding moment. All in all, the food was delicious, our food came out very fast, the service was excellent, and the Pizookie was the icing on the cake (so to speak).  Thank you BJ's for making our date night truly special!

This isn't the first time and this place must be Union.  The bartenders must be dishwashers and janitors, bc all they do is clean and never ask if anyone needs anything.   Please staff one extra person or go over what service should mean.  The BJ's in HB and Tustin are much better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=120

Elaine P.,"Winnetka, Los Angeles, CA",48,148,609,5.0,9/3/2015,"I was wary of coming here due to the recent reviews, but I got the opposite experience. Went here Monday night for a farewell dinner. Parking is free and it's a 2-3 story lot next to the restaurant. It's fairly busy even on a Monday, but we were seated quickly.  Our server was the nicest guy ever. Friendly demeanor, patient, and didn't get our orders wrong (argh! I wish I remembered his name to give him credit!). When he found out that it was a reunion, farewell, and late bday celebration all in one, he was like ""I usually don't do this but..."" When someone says that, you can't help but be curious. He offered to make us a 'pizookie platter'. What is that you ask? Well, I'll just say, It's a monster. It's 4 cookie flavors in a large pizza pan topped with a mountain of ice cream. None of us could finish it (I regret nothing! NOTHING!). Other than our main waiter, other servers were nice and helpful when we asked them to take pictures of us. Our main food and drinks were great, no complaints there. Get the fish and chips (extra tartar) and the berry cider (Jerry Berry, I think it's called). All in all, a great place to bring a small group of friends. The customer service made the memories all the more sweeter (hah!

Melanie W.,"Studio City, CA",378,25,101,1.0,8/18/2016,"We came here last weekend and once again regretted it.  I'm not one to complain but sometimes you can become so annoyed and disappointed with a place that you really should say something. When we walked in it was pretty empty and quiet with tons of tables open in the front and back.  There are two separate desk areas in the entrance.  One was empty and the other had three people behind it talking. You could tell that they weren't servers because of their attire.  We stood there as they continued to talk and ignore us and waited until I tried to get their attention.  Someone suggested that we could sit at the bar table tops for happy hour if we would like and we declined because we wanted to sit more comfortably than teetering on some tall stools with tables. More confused conversations ensued and they asked if we would like to sit in the back of the restaurant and we requested to sit in one of the booth areas near the front. They told us that we would have to wait until the hostess returned to seat us and 'make sure that it was 'okay' so we sat down and waited. We were the only two people waiting to be seated.  Five minutes later (finally) this extremely busy hostess in this empty restaurant showed up and asked us if we wanted to sit in 'happy hour' and again we said no thank you can we please sit in the front and she said that's happy hour and I asked about the booths and many tables beside the happy hour and that's when she said I'll have to ask someone first and then she asked  'Would you like to sit in the back?' REALLY?  Seriously? Umm, no.  1st thing-We already had this conversation with someone else   2nd -that's where you should put large parties and families or for when they have a fully packed restaurant. Why would you put a couple of two in the back of a very big empty restaurant? Especially if they already asked to be seated in a different section already. It's insulting. Listen, I know the drill.  You have servers in certain areas and it's your job to farm tables for sections and their servers. I get it, but don't put guilt trips on customers because they don't want to sit there and try to make them feel like they are being difficult.  Unacceptable. Smile and say of course. Next we get our waitress who was a bit intense.  She seemed irritated or something. We ordered chicken wings as an appetizer (they never came out) our server didn't even notice until after our salads and we were eating our meal. (Another thing that I would like to mention here is that the wait staff doesn't even bring the food to your table and I know that's common now and I get it-but the waiter or waitress should always come over and make sure everything is thumbs up) Plus how can you be soooooo busy when you don't even have to bring out the food???  Seriously?  I just don't understand.  I was a waitress in one of the busiest restaurants in town. She was nowhere to be found 95% of the time. When she finally realized it she said 'you still want those wings right?' and I said 'no, it's okay' and she got irritated and huffed off.  This brings me to the food. Every meal that I've had has always been sub-par.  Everything tastes very bland and mass produced.  There's not a lot of love in what they serve, or a very good palate. The selection (book) menu doesn't feel right.  It's way too large and Overwhelming-while the food is Underwhelming. The golden rule is don't try to do everything just do some things really well.  Anyway, it was my man's birthday and still trying to make the best of the situation we ordered the cookie with ice cream. I think they call it a Pizookie?? it came out hard as a rock.  You couldn't even put a fork in it.  It was terrible.  The whole experience was terrible. Like a bad dream. The hostess was difficult.  The waitress was difficult and the food doesn't cut it.  Their only saving grace is their beer selection. I'm not going to name our server because I don't want to point her out specifically-but her attitude stinks.  Maybe one of the managers will note that she was working the front bar and seating area last Friday.  Maybe she was in a bad mood that day but who cares? not us when we're trying to have a nice dinner. I've worked in two different restaurants and the first rule is to leave your emotions at the door. especially if you want to make money. Her attitude is affecting your business because we won't be coming back.  Any suggestion that I would have is to change your staff or do some retraining and remind them that they are in customer service. They seem to be more preoccupied in conversations with co workers and giving attitude more than making a pleasurable dining experience. Also try to make a better smaller menu. We go to dinner three times a week and we've given this place more than a few tries and this was our last. We aren't returning but I'm hoping that someone within the company will read this and make some severely necessary changes to this restaurant.

Jeannie M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,4/20/2017,"I came here with my nephew on a Thursday around 9:30. There was a 15 minute wait which is about what we expected. They weren't that busy, so I wasn't expecting the horrible service we got.   Our appetizer came but we didn't have plates so I asked the gentleman if he could bring us some. He passed us up two times before I finally asked him again. He apologized and said he'd be right back. We never saw him at our table again. About 5 min later the food came. We ended up just starting everything at the same time.   My nephew ordered a burger, and when the waitress finally came back ( We hadn't seen her since she took our order) he asked for ketchup. By the time it showed up he had finished his fries, and his burger was cold.   She walked away before he could ask for a refill so he sat through his meal without one. Noticing this I made sure to go easy on my iced tea.  After we were done we sat there for about 10 min longer before the guy who forgot our plates noticed us and walked to the back. Coincidentally our waitress emerged and asked if we needed refills.  I told her we needed a refill and some boxes because we just wanted to leave.    She came back another 10 minutes later to take our plates and ask if we needed anything else and 5 min later she dropped the check. My nephew burst into laughter when she came back for the check because that was done in under 2 minutes.   I get it. I was a waiter for over 10 yrs, and sometimes you get busy. This was not that situation.  Nobody in that place gave a crap, and management was nowhere to be found.    I left a tip because they have to pay taxes, but I'll be damned if I go back to that place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=120

I reluctantly called back today and was told to hold while the person who answered transferred me to a manager. I asked for an explanation, ""why did I need a manager?"" He said they were booked, I asked what their reservation policy was? He said typically you have to reserve a day prior or days prior. I explained I had attempted to reserve and was told to call the next morning. At least this person was a bit more helpful but still a ridiculous attempt to book reservation.

Melanie D.,"Los Angeles, CA",307,948,1538,3.0,2/25/2015,"This review is for BJ's beer dinner event. Several times per year, BJ's holds beer dinners, highlighting a special brewery. This time it was Rogue Brewery from Oregon. The dinner is 4 courses with 8 different beers to try - 6 from Rogue and 2 beers that they brew themselves. The cost is $30 advanced purchase, $35 on the day of the event. They started with the lightest brew (good chit pilsner - yes, that's the name!) and progressed to the richest one (double chocolate stout). They served a variety of ales in between. Each beer pour was about 6 oz, so drinking a full 8 of them would have been way too much. They were very generous with their pours (sometimes offering seconds), and it was nice to be able to taste so many different beers. Unfortunately, the food was lackluster and boring. They started with 2 appetizers - crispy, fried artichokes and chicken tavern-cut (thin crust) pizza. The entree was cajun pasta. The apps were tasty enough but nothing special. The entree was horribly bland with a minimal amount of chicken and overcooked pasta. Dessert was an individual sized peanut butter pizookie (basically a big chewy cookie) topped with vanilla ice cream. If you like their pizookie, this is right up your alley.  The amount of beers to try was impressive, but the food left a lot to be desired. I'm glad I tried it, but unless they elevate the food, it will be my last beer dinner here. parking -limited free self parking or valet",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=120
Regina P.,"Burbank, CA",16,70,48,2.0,2/8/2016,"BJ's has really declined in their service and quality of their food.  On this particular visit, my dad ordered a steak to be well-done and was shocked to see how raw the meat was (I posted a photo). At first, he tried to forget about it and dunk the pieces in some A1, but the texture was chewy and tasted bloody. So, as you can imagine, it was difficult to swallow. I called to speak with a manager and I was surprised by the lack of reaction to my dad's raging red steak. He tried to be reassuring by insisting that my dad was always welcome to have his meal sent back to the kitchen to be fixed. I explained to the manager that my father was a diabetic and couldn't wait for the restaurant to get things right on their second, or perhaps, third try.  I didn't appreciate the direction of our interaction. I felt as though the manager was simply shrugging off the incident as something that happens sometimes, instead of taking full accountability and apologizing on behalf of their error. Although I made it clear that there was no excuse for the raw steak, it still felt like taking it off the bill was pulling teeth for this guy, (though it should have been a no-brainer).  It's unbelievable what customer service has become. I feel like this restaurant needs to be more willing to take responsibility for their mishaps and not try to smooth things over by offering a free pizookie. You can't buy a consumer's loyalty with a hot cookie and vanilla bean ice cream, even if it does sound tempting.  Simply apologizing and not making excuses for your staff's error would've sufficed. Speaking up about the quality of food being sub-par shouldn't be taken lightly. My parents don't go out to eat much and they shouldn't have to settle or wait forever for the staff to get it right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=120

Mind you i always tip 15 percent and i always try to be polite because i use to worked in the food industry but the people working at BJ's lack proper training. Not only do they ignore you but the one time i go with my family to celebrate a few day after my sister graduation they made us wait a hour for our food because the system went down and instead of apologizing the server had the guts to tell my cousin waiting a 1 hour and 30 min for a party of eight is the norm and gave a lot of attitude when we ask when is our food was coming. Not only did the food came late but it was also cold. To stop us from leaving the manager promised us to give us a pizookie on our next visit instead of there and now and when we asked if we can get a coupon or a written agreement he told us he told us he would honor his word and when we did come back he lied to our faces and said he does not remember that and played ignorant till we left. All in all the service is terrible unless your in a big party, the manager is a liar, and the food is not even that great it comes out lacking flavor, cold, and might have egg shells in it.

It wasn't even as busy as I expected, but maybe they were understaffed? Took 20 minutes to get our drinks and an additional 10 to get our orders taken. Had to ask for silverware and once we got it, it was dirty. There was a guy smoking at the table next to us. The waiters didn't ask him to put out his cigarette until someone complained.

Very attentive and friendly. The food was great! Noise level was a lil bit too much but we were seated near the kitchen so maybe this was a factor. Booths are nice and roomy too. The bathroom was pretty dirty though. It smelled bad and had lots of garbage on the floors. This was a shame too because otherwise, the decor  was nice. They also have a toddler toilet which is great for the kiddos, however, they don't have any kind of sign on the outside of the stall.

They are pleasant and rarely have gotten any orders wrong in all the years I've been coming here. The drinks are great as well, especially the beers.

Carrie S.,"Burbank, CA",216,56,18,2.0,10/23/2016,"I will start with a positive, our server Sarah was so sweet.  It was a Saturday afternoon and me and my friend just wanted a chill place to have a bite to eat & gab. Well, what used to be a spot to visit on occasion, this experience will definitely deter from that. Our food took quite a long time for a couple of sandwiches, one cold and one hot. When our food finally arrived, my french fries weren't what I ordered and my sandwich was cold. Sarah was kind to send it back to the kitchen and bring me hot and fresh fries while I waited for my fresh sandwich. I had ordered it WITHOUT BACON, I want that to be clear from the get-go! When my sandwich came back, it was hot but had bacon in it. That was unfortunate. I brought it my server's attention and she apologized profusely. She asked if a wanted another one and at that point, it wasn't worth it. I ordered the salad I should have ordered to begin when perusing the large menu of options. The manager came over and said ""I heard there was a problem with your sandwich and we'll take care of it for you."" I told him how the first one was cold, and the second one had bacon in it. He quipped ""It didn't."" Shocked by how the 'customer is always right' didn't apply, I said, ""I know it did, sir."" He said, again, as matter of factly, ""I'm telling you didn't."" Appalled by how rude this man was speaking to me, I said, ""I'm telling you that it did."" And he then had the audacity to say, ""it was probably an overcooked piece of chicken that you mistook it for."" Whoa, are you kidding me? So now am I not only ""wrong"" but it's okay to serve a guest overcooked meat?! Wow. I tried to keep the smile on my face and not the show the disgust I felt in the pit of my stomach. He then walked away.  Off the look of my friend, who was equally mortified, I asked if I had come off to him in any way that would warrant him to speak to me so passive aggressive and condescending, and she said ""no."" I flagged our server over and thanked her, and mentioned that the manager had come over to address the food issues, by being beyond rude to me as a customer and basically called me a liar. She also was extremely apologetic. So sir, I now know you're the GM of that location and I will let your corporate office know what a jerk you were to a customer. The fact of the matter is this, I don't go out to eat often but when I do, I expect great service from top to bottom. The kitchen doesn't have it's stuff together because they messed up the order three times. Your food runners should get the food to the table faster so it's hot when served, then I suppose this situation wouldn't have happened to begin with.

Mish S.,"Long Beach, CA",380,505,682,2.0,1/26/2017,"The service today was so incredibly poor. Our waitress was so unprofessional. Firstly, she was not informative about the happy hour menu and seemed annoyed when we asked her about it. Secondly, she took our friends orders but did not take ours when we were all clearly sitting at one table until we called her back after she disappeared so it was awkward waiting an extra 15 mins for our food after our friend's already came out. They had to wait and by the time our food came there was freezing cold.  She was abrasive and blunt and did not make us feel welcome at all.  Not only was the annoying error of not checking if the entire group had ordered a pain, but she did not push for our orders to come out first when the restaurant was empty and we ordered before everyone else, yet everyone's food came out before ours: also did I mention that we ordered tiny appetizers?  It should not have take the length of around 30 mins that it did for our food. The bill even with happy hour came out to be a hefty $65, with everyone ordering one appetizer each and a drink (not all alcoholic).  I love BJ's but their happy hour deals are not worth it, and this waitress definitely needs retraining. She ruined our dining experience and upset our friends with her uncaring behavior.

Morpheus V.,"Burbank, CA",0,1,,1.0,4/29/2017,"My 14yr old daughter warned us, only I thought she was just upset that we weren't going to her choice of restaurant. This place was the nightmare you always hear about,  but have yet to experience. Where do I start? After a 30 minute wait, we were seated in the upper corner of the place. The waiter was a nice guy, attentive to entering our order. I assume he entered the selections correctly on his tablet device,  but it started with my daughter getting a strawberry lemonade when she asked for a regular lemonade. She's particularly self conscious about attention and makes it clear, even though it's wrong, ""it's fine."" Our order staggered to the table, yet one thing after another was wrong. My burger was cold and lacked the normal amount of mayonnaise and also the tomatoes I requested on it. Mayo lettuce tomato and cheese is simple, yet their kitchen showed that they could screw it up on another level. Then came the pizza we ordered, oh wait, the delivery person, not our waiter,  gave us someone else's pizza. Our waiter came over and took it back. About 10 minutes later,  the waiter was heading our way with what appeared to be our actual pizza. Somewhere on the stairs up, the pizza dropped to the floor just 15 feet away from our table. He apologize and said they would get working on a new one. By the time we were eating it, most of the place had left for the night. In the end, the $13 burgers sucked. The baked Ziti was bland and left much to be desired. The right pizza took FOREVER. AND it seems that the management was like a absent landlord. After the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant,  there was zero contact about how they would make it right. How can management be this oblivious to such horrible service? Instead we received our bill which exceeded $90, zero courtesy credit for the messed up order or the complete inconvenience of the pizza issue, or the horrible burgers. Go here at your own peril. But don't say I didn't warn you.  We on the other hand, will avoid it and share our experience with friends and family, most who, like us, live here in Burbank, California.  If you like to have customers,  you should appreciate them enough to own your horrific service, and make things right with them. Otherwise,  like us, they will walk away,  and start running as soon as they hit the doors to the outside.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=100

Maybe it doesn't help that you ask who's your waiter. No water offered upon arrival. The impression I got being from out of town is. Don't come here so bad. No appetizer even though it was ordered. Food came kinda cold. And we'll after telling the waiter no appetizer just food. I did get a free desert. But was gonna order one anyways.

Joe E.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",849,385,1240,2.0,12/30/2014,"It's kind of silly to write a review that is only highlighting lunch specials. A chicken quesadilla and chicken tacos. Each served with a side of black beans and 3 tortilla chips. 3. Coming in at around 6 dollars a piece, what is there to complain about? It's just that the tacos were so dry it was almost inedible. The quesadilla was mostly crispy tortilla. If you're going to have lunch specials, at least make them good. Next time we drive by all I will think about is the blah food we had last time.  On the bright side, the beer was 3.50 a pint. Their IPA is pretty tasty if you're a fan of the West Coast style. Service also wasn't bad. But it wasn't great either.

Wanting a little sun, we opted to sit on the patio rather than the dimly lit restaurant so the seating was quick. We ordered a couple of lunch specials and drinks. The food (personal pizza, salad, sandwich) was your standard BJ's quality food. Wedge salad, potato wedges, chicken tenders, and of course the small pizookie were good, but the pulled pork sandwich didn't have enough sauce on it. From this visit I've now noted that they've gotten on board with smaller drink portions, so I got a half pint of their Berry Burst Cider since it was still midday.  The service was fine albeit laggy, but put me on the list of others who have issues with their valet parking. Being first time visitors, we pulled into the lot thinking the only option was valet because of their sign. If we knew self parking was also an option we would have tried that first, or at least nearby parking.

There are a few different rooms so it doesn't feel like you are surrounded by people.  I've gotten so many things here, but I would say the ""Great White"" pizza is my absolute favorite. The personal size is perfect. I don't even like deep dish pizza but I just love it.  ALL of the appetizers are phenomenal. You really can't go wrong. My favorite is the pepperoni pizza dip though. I've made pizza dip before with basically the same ingredients and it's no where near as good as theirs.  This really goes without saying, but the pizookies are life changing.

But my partner is in his late 20's and won't go to BJs due to noise. My son was annoyed and he's 12! Noise is elevated because now customers are talking  louder to be heard. Conversely we went to Outback the other day. It was just as crowded, but they had the music turned down so it was still pleasant.  I think we'll have to take BJ's off our list and warn others off on Yelp.

Haley K.,"San Jose, CA",500,405,720,3.0,7/21/2015,"I love BJ's Restaurant...usually. I actually had just visited the San Diego location only a week prior, so I'm definitely a fan. Can't go wrong with their oreo poozokie and their deep dish pizza's! My family was in town and staying at the Marriott in Burbank, walking distance to this location. We figured why not grab some dinner there. We all love this place, so it was perfect. I called ahead to make sure we didn't have to wait too long, since it was a Friday evening. We got there, put our name in and only waited about 5 minutes before we were seated in a big booth. Perfect! Our waiter was great. He was super attentive and I could tell running around to make sure everyone was pleased, but apparently there were some kitchen issues. I'm glad we opted away from ordering a deep dish pizza (got the flat bread to start, which was good), because the large table next to us had ordered 2 large deep dish pizzas and apparently had been there for almost 2 hours waiting. They were accommodating, giving them free salads and making sure they were happy, but still!  My dad got the fish and chips, and my mom and I decided to split the avocado egg rolls and the shrimp scampi. She had ordered it before and enjoyed it, and I had been wanting to try it. When it came out, it looked nothing like the picture on the menu. I'm not one to send food back, but it was horrible. No flavor at all. I felt bad since I knew they were stressing out with the kitchen issue, but I also didn't think we should pay $17 for something we didn't touch more than a few bites. The manager came out and was nice. Asked if we wanted to try something else or would like a poozkie, but at that time it was late, we had an appetizer and ate the eggrolls, so we were fine. We also didn't want to be stuck waiting for anything else.  I'm not sure I would go back to that location, but I will give this place 3 stars because the service was great.

Benjamin S.,"Los Angeles, CA",460,460,191,3.0,6/5/2015,"I've been coming to this BJ's since it opened as I was one of the original servers hired on back in 2000 when they opened.  I respect the company tremendously and it's been interesting to watch their menu change over the years (and sadly, the price of the pizzookie go up... oh inflation!)   Back in April my wife had her birthday and since she's part of the BJ's club, she gets a free pizzookie so she thought to make life easy on us all, we'd just have a pizza and pizzookie for dinner that night and do it takeout style.  She called at 4:30 in the afternoon to have the host tell her he was too busy to take her order and that she'd have to call back in an hour.  Had he said that to me, I would have given him an earful, asked to speak with the manager, given them an earful and made sure never to return to this restaurant again.  Remember, I worked for BJ's and I KNOW this is unacceptable.  My wife was annoyed, but she really wanted pizza and a pizzookie (she's pregnant) so she called back an hour later. Picks up the pizza, comes home, and on our Sweet Pig, there was very few 'sweets' or 'pigs' meaning very little pineapple or ham.  There was also hardly any sauce on the pizza so it was super dry and a thin layer of cheese.  Again, I worked at BJ's and never saw a pizza look like this.  Then, our chocolate cookie for the pizzookie was burnt to a crisp on the outside, and raw on the inside.  What the heck?!   This is not cool ever, but for someone's birthday meal?  I call BJ's and ask to speak to the manager.  I really want to remember his name correctly, I believe it was Mark (he was fairly new and had only worked at BJ's for a few months.)  Mark turned the whole situation around.  He was extremely apologetic and asked us to come into the restaurant as his treat to compensate for this nightmare of an experience.  We worked out the day and time. Came in and was seated.  Our server was very friendly, but pretty slow and forgot several requests (lemons for our ice water, to go boxes etc.)  We touch base with Mark and he did a great job dealing with us.  Meal was on the house and a bit of faith was restored in the Burbank BJ's location.  Good to see it's not going down the tubes 15 years later.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=200

Uncle L.,"VALLEY VILLAGE, CA",228,98,,2.0,3/27/2016,"This place is the very definition of mediocrity as far as eating at any sort of chain restaurant. (Yard house, TGI Fridays, etc) Typical ""wait staff doesn't give a shit,"" sat for 15 minutes before anyone even took our drink order. Another 10 minutes at least til the drinks came. Waitress barely checked on us, didn't see her again til we were ready for the check. (Had to flag her down every time) Food was bland and thrown together; boneless chicken wings looked and tasted like they had come out of a microwave. (They barely took the time to toss them in wing sauce, most of them were half covered) No presentation, no passion whatsoever. Just everything thrown onto plates like you got up at 3am and nuked leftovers, then sat down to watch an episode of Roseanne until ""the spins"" wore off because you drank too much.  The lighting in this place sucks, I don't know why it's so bright. It's a lot of rocks & wood ""ale house"" motif, yet have it lit up like a surgical theater. I don't know why there was a 20 minute wait when easily 1/4 of the restaurant was obviously available for seating, empty tables and even whole sections all over the place. The parking ramp is a nightmare, it's horribly designed and way too small.  Trying to eat out anywhere in LA is just abysmal, the service sucks 90% of the time anywhere you go, because it's people that don't give a shit about their job or the customer service, they're just there until they find something better or get that role in a sitcom they moved here for. This BJ's reeked of that attitude, ""sit down, eat, pay, get the fuck out."" It had all the ambience and passion of a school cafeteria.

I was extremely ripped off and the orders were ALL wrong!! The take out order consisted of 3 burgers and 1 pazookie. I have been to other locations so I knew what to expect. However, the order was not what I was expecting. 2 burgers were ordered with no tomatoes, they both had tomatoes. Some people are allergic to tomatoes. 1 burger was ordered on sourdough.

The pazookie was extremely disappointing. I've had delicious pazookies before so I was very excited to indulge and share it. When I opened the cookie, I was shocked!! The cookie was burnt and tiny!! It was about half the tin which it usually completely fills up. I basically paid $7 for a chips ahoy cookie.

Alysha T.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,51,31,1.0,6/8/2016,"Let's start off the review with how we got seated in a pretty crappy section, right by their extra back door and a servers pos station.  Every other minute a busser, a server on a smoke break, or a customer being directed out by servers. So every 5 seconds the light was shining in on me and my boyfriend face and eyes, the constant door opening and shutting was getting pretty irritating because the light was in and out of our eyes every other second and it was actually getting pretty warm too. OH And the kicker was how loud that table was, the servers literally yelling at the pos station behind my head, the ridiculous noises  coming from outside, and the overall noise of the restaurant. Ok whatever, not that big of a deal right?  My table was sticky, ok still not a big deal.  Our server was polite, and suggested us the queso dip, it came out DELICIOUSSS. What wasn't delicious was the fruit fly/knat that was in it. Ok whatever. It happens. It's a knat, it's tiny it happens when doors get opened. We've all eaten worse. No big deal for me, and this queso dip is the bomb.  We get our I believe it was some sort of guacamole bacon or avocado bacon burger, it was pretty basic nothing special at all, and rather bland to be honest, patty did not seem seasoned with even salt or pepper.  We also had a meat lovers pizza of some sort, also again basic, on the greasy side, and the crust was on the rubbery spectrum of crust, and wasn't delivered with any sort of utensil to actually cut the pizza just our butter knives and forks with our silverware, although servers were constantly behind me not one of them would stop talking to each other long enough to realize I've had my head turned waving my hand in their face asking for some sort of pizza cutter or anything really, that was more helpful to actually cut the pizza.  Once I was finally noticed they sent a server running to grab one she then sliced it for us.  Now desert, the whole reason we all come to BJS right! We now have another server a very awkward, timid server, we basically had to offer ourselves a menu to her, to choose our pizzookies! We got a trio, they sounded amazing and I've eaten at a couple different BJS and have always had the best experiences with their pizzookies,  The only issue was that the cookie was barely luke warm at most on arrival. It reminded me of a sad microwaved Von's cookie that lost any sort of the heat by the time they actually got it to the table.  Kinda bummed, considered still going back for desert again sometime. Until it hit about 10 PM and I felt uncomfortably sick to my stomach, my boyfriend was asleep and woke up around 12 AM feeling exactly the same, and now I'm sure we will NOT GO BACK to this location whatsoever and possibly the chain as a whole because of how bad this experience was, during, and after.

I went with my 2 kids and mom for a late Sunday lunch around 2:30. My kids order tenders and a pizza and of coarse they wanted cheese sticks. My mom asked for a cup of soup and shrimp tacos, I asked for a sandwich. We waited 30 minutes for the appetizer and soup on top of that my moms food was wrong waited about 45 minutes for my kids food and an HOUR for my sandwich and my moms tacos that they brought wrong..... my moms soup came cold BOTH times and we had to flag down a waiter in a group of servers talking and joking with someone that seemed to work there but was off the clock to get a refill on our drinks we waited 20 minutes for these refills. My youngest daughter did not like the pizza so I had to order solders for her.... not only did it take another 35 minutes but the server brought it in a to go plate knowing that we were waiting so could eat. This was just the beginning.... the server was nice about it and it was ok. Our total came out to 55.37. My mom gave 20 cash and I told the server he could put the rest on my card. Well I checked my account today and I was charged THREE times! One for the total 55.37, the second for 20.00 and the third for 34.37 I was furious because they didn't even tell me.

Kayla R.,"Los Angeles, CA",107,105,240,5.0,4/19/2016,"I've been here several times & even at the Glendale location. Not sure why I haven't written a review yet, but I really needed to after my last experience. We came here last Thursday after my brother's pinning ceremony and figured this would be a quick and smart place to go and have a celebratory dinner. We walked in with 7 of us. They just needed to set the table & had us seated right away. Our server was Jan & she took care of us entirely. Everyone got their own thing, but I ordered the Lemon Thyme Chicken and the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms. I always always always get the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms when I'm here. It is so freakin' good. Highly recommend!!!!!!! My parents shared a rack of ribs with their side soups. My brother got the jambalaya. I'm not sure what the rest of our group ordered, but everyone was happy. No complaints. Everything was delicious. I tried some of my parents' & brother's order and everything was cooked & seasoned well. Our server even offered a complimentary pazookie to my brother as we were there celebrating him as a new college graduate. How sweet & kind of her! It was such a special day for him, so I thought it was extremely thoughtful of her to do that for us without us even asking!!!!!!!!! She took care of us from beginning to end & her section was full!!!!! I love a good server. Good food. Good service.

Christina C.,"Los Angeles, CA",240,140,2,1.0,8/9/2016,"I'm really disappointed to say that I've been coming to this BJ's for the last 4 years that I've lived in Burbank, and each experience has blatantly and steadily declined in quality. Last weekend, a small group of us (5 total) came in for a birthday dinner at around 6:30pm. We were seated at a high top in the bar area since there were lots of empty tables. We got our drinks in a timely manner and proceeded to order our entrees (a salad, a small plate of wings, chicken tacos, lemon tyme chicken, and a burger). We talked and hung out....and realized that AN HOUR has passed by and we haven't gotten our food yet. Checked in with the server, and she assured us the food was on its way. 15-20 mins later, the food arrived, except for the burger. The 4 of us were almost done eating when we had to remind the server that we were still missing the burger. 20 mins later, the server came over with the burger, and to collect our empty plates :( A very nice manager came over and asked us if our food was alright, and that he would take off the burger from the bill and offered us complimentary Pazookis, which was unexpected! We probably should've left at this point because the 3 mini pazookis took well over 30-40 mins to arrive. The whole dinner took about 2.5 hours, and the restaurant wasn't at capacity by any means. When we were finally able to flag down our server, we were charged incorrectly, and the desserts were charged as well. At this point, instead of having the bill fixed, we bit the bullet and paid it so we could leave as soon as possible. Bottom line: It was probably a warning sign when all 5 of us started to realize we've all had horrible previous experiences here and traded stories. Honestly, the food is really great, but DON'T expect decent service AT. ALL.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=240

I had to ask serval times for my beer and when it was finally brought to me after 15 minutes of waiting, I received my beer in a dirty warm glass with spots all over the glassware. Also when we ordered all our food was brought out at different times when we all ordered together, why each plate had to come 15 minutes apart from each other is extremely odd and when I asked the waiter what was going on with the long wait, he simply ignored us and walked away.

Yet we don't go to BJ's that often. My wife suggested I get the ribeye. As I love a good steak. So we order. My wife gets strawberry lemonade and I got sunset peach ice tea. Got the drinks and my wife has that yuk look on her face after the first drink. The drink was so sweet it was like drinking double the sugar this drink should have. My wife ordered some sort of shrimp dinner. She order an appitizer mushroom. It was pretty good and there was a lot of them. I ordered a clam chowder soup. I thought it was pretty good. My wife said it was a bit salty. But she still ate some anyway. Now we get the main dishes. My wife food was great. Now my food, I taste the mash potatoes and its bland. I think ok fine. I taste the steak and it has huge chunks of salt on top. I know a good steak need salt bit this is rediculous amount of salt. My wife tried it and said she can taste the salt even after having some of her drink. I tell the waiter. He takes it back. It takes a long time as they had to cook another. By then I had another ice tea. Now I'm full and didn't even get to have steak. The waiter offered me more food. I turned him down and got the steak to go. For a steak meal I was disappointed all the way around. $62 for a meal for 2 with no alcoholic drinks. Think I will pass on the steak here. As well will think twice before I come for a meal again.

And the selections of veers and occasional local featured beers is always refreshing. Usually don't have a complaint about this place, which is why we return even after the mishap I'm about to explain. Now... one of their downfalls is an obvious breakdown in the kitchen. For a family who does not eat beef, it was disheartening to be served clam chowder bowls with chili chunks in it, not once but TWICE in the same meal.  Seems like some jack ass in the kitchen did not give enough thought to cross contaminating the soups, and after being told by the manager that he changed the entire clam chowder container, the replacement had chili beans in it too!  After pointing this out, I ordered a grilled cheese with shoestring fries and they attempted to charge me for the soup AS WELL AS the grilled cheese. Needless to say, a simple discussion with the waitress and she made sure all of it was removed from the bill.  It seems like over time, this place is starting to struggle with basic food prep errors, but still a great atmosphere overall.  And despite some of their pitfalls, management usually goes out of their way to fix issues and make accommodations to show their apologies instead of it just being lip service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=240

When my group arrived we came in 2 cars there was only parking for 1 so we asked the valet guy if there was any other palce to park the car, he said no and that we had to go somewhere else to park. Since we were on short time limit we paid for the valet, but they didnt park our car, we parked it  ourselves. We didnt have to wait long to be seated and the waiter was very nice and patient. We get our drinks and food in a decent time. We shared a plate of some noodles (i dont remember what the plate was called). I get my fork and wrap the noddles around and eat it. As i am eating i feelvsomething a little hard amd thought it might be a bone. I pull it out and see that it is a metal tie that you get on your beard or tortillas. I wasnt mad or looking for blood but when our waiter passed by i informed him of it and he apologized and said he would inform the manager. We continue and about 10 minutes later someone with the plate and metal tie come to the table and asks who ordered it. We saod we were sharing the plate but i was the one that pulled it out of my mouth. He tells us the he was cofused cause he says the dont use those types of tie but imstaed have the ones that look kind of like guitar picks. We all look at each other and he asked ""well what do we want?"" We said we dont want anything, just take the plate off our check. I was the first one to take a bite so the plate was almost still there. He kept insist that they dont have that tie. We told him that we work in customer service and didnt want to cause any problem just to let them know what happen. He looks at me and says ""well you would be suprised at what people in customer service will do to get free stuff."" That got me mad. To accuse us of tryimg to get a free meal is horrible to say. But he kept on asking if we wanted anything. We also came to realize that he is the chef not the manager. So why is he coming out and the manager not.

Waitress brought drinks right away and took our order then proceeded to flirt with a table in the bar which seemed to be her friends from high school, was not surprised. Salad and soup came out a little slow but not horrible. Now is when it gets exciting. The food expeditor brought out our food and gave it to the table across from us. The table accepted the salad which was a BBQ chicken salad but turned away the flat bread pizza. The other table started to chow away at the salad and made comments that this does not seem like what they order and we laughed. About 10 mins later our waitress decides to pull away from her high school friends and comes by our table and asks ""is there anything else I can get you"" ummm yeah what about our meal? She was dumbfounded with a blank stare. She obviously was not paying attention to anything but her high school boy friends. She said she would look into it. We waited another 20 mins with twice asking the pre occupied waitress where are meal is and she only once went back into the kitchen as she was too enthralled with her ""friends"". Finally we ask a different waitress and another waiter to get the manager and nothing for 10 mins, NOTHING. Our waitress walks by and we ask her for the manager and he/she never shows. We get up to leave and I mention to the front desk that we are leaving and to let the manager know since he can't be bothered to come talk to us that we are leaving and he can take the salad and soup off of our bill. And now the plot thickens..... As we are waking out the door a young deer in the headlights manager comes up and ask if he can help us. We explained everything to him and he says "" well I just got here at 5pm and have only been here for 9 minutes and proceeds to pull out his smart phone and show me the time, really? REALLY manager Mark? Wow no apology, no solution nothing. I ask him if there was no manager on duty prior to his arrival and he says he didn't know. Again, really?

Never did we expect to wait 1 hr 15mins after we put in our orders. He did offer to comp the 2 extra late meals, but this won't resolve their internal problems.

We were seated right away and our server took our drink orders. Half an hour passed and they barely took our order for appetizers. For that length of time we had already decided what were gonna have as our main course. 2 parties came after us and they have already been served their appetizers while we were still waiting for ours. I called our waiter's attention to ask what was going on. He said its because we ordered steaks and those take a little bit of time. I said, ok thats understandable, but the appetizers shouldnt take that long. Then he said he was gonna check. Couple mins later the Manager (Im assuming she was the Manager) approached us and she was very nice and she apologized and that she saw the time of our order and she didnt know what happened either as to why it took so long, according to her, the appetizers that we ordered shouldnt have taken that long. She was very polite the whole time and I respect that. All in all, we probabaly waited about an hour and 10mins just to be served appetizers.  Now the food.  The quality of the Calamari rings was wack! It tasted different, it used to be light and crunchy, now its all greasy and chewy and it was a little bland. We had the Gourmet Mac n Cheese and that was good, also the fried artichokes, I didnt like those very much. I ordered the Ribeye steak medium well with the side of filaf rice and chicken tortilla soup. The chicken tortilla soup was a bit salty. My cousin who came later ordered spinach dip and chips. Refer to the picture i posted of the tortilla chips of how greasy they served it to us. Dont they let it sit on a napkin or at least shake of the residual oil? Idk if the regular main cook was off that day or whats going on?  By the end of dinner, I got the bill and they waived all our appetizers. They only charged us for the main course and the drinks, which I appreciate, thank you BJ's, but I didnt come to get free food. I am more than willing to pay, obviously, but service sucks. I would understand if they were crazy packed, but they werent. What happened??",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=280

Others came after us, got their food and was almost done, before we even got our food. I called and requested to speak with the manager. He name is Ashley. I told her what was going on, she asked if I was here and came over.. 12:47pm our food arrives as Ashley is speaking with me. I told her the service we are receiving is unacceptable... She said a few things and realized whatever she was saying we're sounding like excuses. She was very apologetic and stated they should've been more prepared for the rush due to Mother's Day. I appreciate that she understood that. Ashley, indeed, made things right and accommodated us for the bad service received.  Thank you Ashley.

Our waiter was perpetually MIA. The potatoes were nearly inedible. A paste so thick and dry I could have hung a shelf with it or built a brick wall to last the ages..  The chicken was barely seasoned and poor quality.. Like discount bulk chicken from a bin.. Will not order balsamic glazed chicken again. My husbands burger was basic ordinary nothing great..  just is what it is.  The Gluten free pizookie was very burnt and overly sweet.

Jacqueline R.,"Los Angeles, CA",2491,927,2572,3.0,10/3/2014,2014 YELP 365 CHALLENGE - 289/365 3.5 stars. I have dined at this BJs twice so far. Pretty decent. Seemed like a smaller location but they still had a good amount of seating. There are a lot of walls/columns so it feels really sectioned off and the layout isn't super open.  Thankfully I have never had to wait super long for a table. Service has been pretty good and the food was consistent with other locations. Highly recommend their deep dish pizzas (Great White is my fave!) and their pizookies (large baked cookies with ice cream on top) are a must! I love their Oreo one :) The only reason I was really turned off from this BJs was the valet-only parking. $3.50 to have a guy drive my car into a spot that was literally right in front of the restaurant. I could have done that myself and saved the $$. Valet felt very unnecessary at this location and I was annoyed that I had to pay a guy to move my car 10 ft.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=260

Virian G.,"Sunset Strip, CA",109,10,4,1.0,9/28/2015,"1/2 a star because our Bartender was attentive. Cleanliness: Restrooms were terrible. I get that it's Sunday and you had a busy turn around. Honestly I saw three hostess. I'm sure one of them could have checked the restroom.  The food: We started with Avocado Egg Rolls. They are my favorite and the real reason I went to BJ's last night. The avocado tasted old.  Ordered Wings Extra Hot and sure enough they tasted like traditional. Sometimes it happens so we ordered one more app hoping we'd hit a good one. The Calamari was not Crispy but in fact was SOGGY!! We should have said something earlier but we were starving. I did not want to wait for a remake. Last but not least shared the Jambalaya with Angel Hair. The plate had water in it from the pasta which diluted the flavor. I asked for a side of Cajun Spices hoping to make it better but by the time I got it my food was cold.  I spoke to a manager ( Tall, Slim, Caucasian, Male, & used to work at The Cheesecake Factory) and clearly he didn't really care. He made us feel as if we were out to get a free meal. When we mentioned how we've been coming to Bjs for years, even though we didn't have a premiere rewards card. (Simply because I don't really care for one) He would continue to justify the reason behind each plate mistake. We also mentioned how we haven't had food all day since we were on a long ride home, he said he hadn't eaten all day either. I never speak up to a manager for this reason and yesterday was the first time I ever spoke to a manager with a complaint. It was a total waste of time.  What a failure!  I guess in order to be treated better you have to have a premiere rewards card so they know and trust your word. 1/2 star for the pizookie.

Jacqueline A.,"Huntington Park, CA",0,4,1,1.0,1/21/2017,"Went in with my boyfriend about 3 weeks ago for dinner. We started off with a drink each: he got a Guinness & I the pear cider. We then ordered the calamari to munch on while our pizza was being made. Well, the drinks were the only good thing that night. We only ate about a quarter of the calamari. It tasted stale and old. Not even warm. And each piece was 99% breading than not. Not a big deal so we let it slide without calling it out to the waiter's attention. Granted, we were hungry and were looking forward to our pizza even more now. Pizza gets to the table and it looks great. We each start with a slice and are immediately disgusted. It was cold and all the veggies seemed to be raw! I went in to feel the pizza pan and cold to the touch, were as other BJ's locations, you have to be careful to not burn yourself on that thing! That was the last straw. It only took one bite from our pizza slices for our appetites to be completely ruined! We were unhappy and proceeded to letting the waiter know of our dissatisfaction. He apologized, asked if he could replace the order for us or get us anything else but we were just done and annoyed by then. He took the food away and we asked to still pay for our drinks so we could leave. 5 minutes of sitting there, the manager comes along and also apologizes. We don't blame him nor the waiter. Just serve better food. Edible dishes! Keep your kitchen on check, please!!! After speaking to the manager, we waited another 10 minutes for the drink bill and nothing. So we left! I guess drinks were on the house?! Whatever. Safe to say I'll never be eating here again. I'll stick to the BJ's by my house....

Cody R.,"Los Angeles, CA",149,4,3,1.0,4/24/2016,"Let me just start this off by saying what wonderful things we had heard about BJ's Brewhouse. My boyfriend is a beer connoisseur, and was excited to go to a local brewhouse. We go out frequently, we enjoy divulging in new foods, drink & experiences overall.        That being said, we were extremely disappointed in Burbank's BJ's Brewhouse.  We sat down at an unset table, I am a server/bartender myself so we always are the first to be understanding of other circumstances, busy restaurants, oversat severs etc. so no big deal to begin.        When our waitress did come over, neither of us were quite ready to order but my boyfriend ordered a beer none the less right away, then pressingly asked if we had decided on appetizers or entrees, we had sat down 2 minutes prior - who would have been ready to place drinks, appetizers & entrees at that point?         His beer came and I ordered one for myself and a small appetizer right after. Our appetizer came before my beer did. She asked again when she dropped off my beer if we were ready to order and did not ever ask how the appetizer was. When at that point, no we were still not ready, she seemed annoyed with us. We ordered fried artichokes with a lemon aoli, the artichokes inside were barely cooked and slid right out of the fried battered around it. Again, we were unimpressed and said nothing. She came back and put our orders in. My boyfriend got the Chicken Barbacoa and I got the Chicken Bacon Siracha Mac & Cheese. When our meals came, they looked nothing like the pictures inside the menu or the descriptions that came with it. They were half the size of the portions shown. We never complain so again, we tried our meals encouragingly and were thoroughly disappointed. My entree had no flavor, the bacon was barely cooked, and I kid you not came with three pieces of broccoli. My boyfriends came with one tiny speck of cilantro and no yogurt crema sauce as it had implied.      In the midst of our meals, our waitress came over, asked how the meal was & offered us dessert while we were still eating.. We declined and ""finished"" soon there after. We waited 15 minutes for our server to come back and ask if we were finished. We waited another 10 minutes for her to return with our check.       We go out very often and are always kind and understanding, but this was such a let down for us. We went in on a Sunday, the place was not extremely busy, and no part of our meals were appetizing or what they appeared. Had we not been starving, we wouldn't have even eaten half of them.      Overall, I can only give BJ's one star, and I do not even think they deserved that. There are so many wonderful places in Burbank, and we will absolutely never be back. Just a headsup to all others who also heard ""amazing"" things about BJ's Brewhouse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=260

Juanita D.,"Los Angeles, CA",333,600,570,3.0,8/29/2013,"Lord have mercy, their Happy Hour, ""Snack"" menu & beer flights here hit the spot. I only went to BJs back in the day for pizookies (this was pre 21). Now being way over 21 and a craft beer drinker, I was told that BJ's brewed their own beers and had flights.  __________________________________________ FOOD/SNACKS: // Chicken Wontons - both the Thai & Buffalo are beyond tasty // Mini Bruschetta - yes please! light, refreshing and with a side dipping sauce that will knock your socks off. // Gourmet Mac & Cheese - good, but needed some salt & pepper  // Cajun Fries (on their BBQ menu) - salty goodness // Buffalo Wings - definitely have a kick to them, be ready to get messy! // Beignet - holy god.. I was expecting a little old fried donut however this is shareable.... it's a huge beignet topped with ice cream, strawberries and whipped cream. BEER: Their best deal on the menu! For around $6-12 bucks you can get a small or large flight set with a variety of their handcrafted beers. I've been impressed by all of the beer samples I've had here. __________________________________________ In all honesty, I love to kick back here... enjoy some beer and a table of appetizers. The service is average probably because of how busy this place is. It's not a 5-star restaurant so I don't expect that. One time there was no toliet paper in the womens restroom which is really incovenient - you regularly have to wave down your waiter. I mean these are things that happen all the time, so I don't let it get the best of me. Also, I dislike the ""valet only"" option... why am I paying for valet in Burbank?! Park across the street in the mini lot like I do for free! (dates/times apply) Extensive menu - something for all to enjoy. I try really hard to not focus on the calorie breakdown...

Nicole L.,"Los Angeles, CA",27,44,,1.0,2/11/2017,"This is an updated review going from 2 stars to 1 and that's being generous. One of the last times we came to this restaurant there was a super long black hair in my boyfriends salad which was met with zero empathy and I felt like I was begging for a fork. Tonight just further justified my last review. First I was told to input my phone number so I could be texted when my table was ready. We grabbed a drink in the bar and when our friends arrived the host told us they had tried calling us for our table a while ago. Why did I put in my number again? Anyway, the waiter was so absent from the table it was unreal. It was at least 20 minutes between sightings and some of those weren't even for our table. We waited a good 20 minutes for our first round and another 20 for the second. There were no napkins or utensils on the table. We had finished our appetizer and they were finally bringing the food out before I even had the opportunity to ask for them. Then he only brought 2 utensils even though there were 4 of us at the table. If he had been more attentive he probably could have sold 2 more rounds of drinks but we didn't see him often enough. It felt like we had to ration the drinks we did have because who knew when we might get more. The restaurant was busy but I didn't see him serving any other tables until they sat a large party nearby (which he shared with another waiter). Whenever I looked around he was nowhere in sight. Tonight was one of the worst experiences I have ever had in a restaurant if not the worst. The only reason I keep coming back is because the food is, for the most part, (minus the hair) very good. In the future we will try to meet at another location even though it will be much further for our friends to drive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=260
Suzy S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,2,3.0,3/30/2016,"I came here with 9 people for a little birthday get-together. We chose to sit outside because it was available right away. The server was super nice but was pretty forgetful when it came to the orders. A couple of us had asked for water with our drinks and she never showed up with the waters. One of us had ordered a Guacamole Deluxe Burger (I think that's the name) and there was no guacamole in the burger. I ordered the Crispy Jalapeno Burger and it was just a plain hamburger. Two people had ordered pasta that wasn't even the correct type. Maybe we had gotten other peoples orders, who knows? We obviously told the server and she didn't fuss or anything and she kept apologizing.  Now for the food itself, it was pretty meh. Nothing too special. The burger I had was cooked to my liking but lacked in any sort of flavor. My friends said the same thing about their food. The only thing we all agreed was good was the wings we got as an appetizer. Our drinks were also way too sweet, hence the need for water. We unfortunately didn't get the infamous pizookie because it was getting late and we all just wanted to go home. All in all, this place is pretty average. I've been to other BJ's and they've been really good.

We treated ourselves to some Santa Fe Spring Rolls (good sized portion for the price), and we both had burgers (he had the jalapeno burger and loved it, I had the regular BJs Brewhouse burger -  both with fries), and of course we had to have a giant cookie topped with ice cream!

It was a Saturday night and extremely busy, so even though they were given over an hour to heat up soup and a cookie, I can maybe understand the wait.  It still isn't ideal, but I'm pretty reasonable.   I got home (5 min drive), opened my food and the soup was cold and the cookie was the wrong order and BARELY cooked. It was just mushy and  completely disappointing.

Kim K.,"Burbank, CA",146,575,3292,2.0,8/11/2012,"BJ's Restaurant & Brewery = Burbank So we went to BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse tonight, 8/10/12 with reservations that were made earlier in the day for a table top of 10 at 7:30.  We were told they only seating available to accommodate that large of a group would be on their outside patio.  (Yea.. fun. It was only 109 in Burbank today).  But that's fine.. the wind was slowly settling in.  I was told they had my table and were just cleaning it up and they'll be right with us.  Approx. 15 min. later, I jokingly went up to the same guy and asked, whatever happened to that table for Kim??  He gave that look of, ""Crap.. where did that go"". After a moment to regain his composure, he had us follow our waitress out to the back patio, So the work begins.  We all just sat down, no we don't know what we want for drinks (there's 5 pages of drinks) and no we aren't ready to order appetizers (again.. 4 pages min and we hadn't even opened the menu OR ordered our drinks!).  But thank you.  Little chit chatting  then spilt glass of water.  Oh the table is up in commotion.  LOL!  Waitress back.. so can I get you drinks.  Well, we just had an accident.  Um.. No not yet.  Thank you. Wait.. could we exchange this table for a stable table?  This one's wobbly.  Eyes roll, kids help.  New table in place.  Thumbs up! OK.. is everyone ready to order drinks?  Yes.  Start with the kids (the ones that look like line backers), work around.  Water with lemon.  Blonde Beer. Hefenweizen, couple pops.  Cool...  No appetizers?  No No thank you.  Oh wait, hello?  Um.   Whoo hoo..  Miss??  Waitress comes back, yes?  Do you sell potato skins?  Yes.  Well we would like an order.  Yes please. Thank you. So you ready to order dinner.  Yes.  Finally.  Please start with the kids (I think they've become full backs by now).  Couple root beer floats, fish & chips, pizzas, burgers, etc.'Great!  Um. could I get a refill of my lemonade.  uhh Sure. Food came.  Everything seemed to par.  Fish and chips were quite nice.  Not to oily.  LOVE LOVE LOVE the thin cut fries!  BONUS!!!  Root beer floats were awesome!  Pizza.. eeehh.  Nothing to write about here.  Overall food decent.   Can I get anything else?  Everyone no no no no... um, yes.  Um hello.  yooo hooo.  It's ok.  No, what is it you want?  WAITRESS!!!  Did you want a drink.  Yes... Just a beer with my pizza.  HELLO MISS... yes?  Yes.. she would like a beer with her pizza.  Ok.  Beer first.   Tick tock tick tock.  Ding.. there's the pizza.   Here's some extra root beer for your floats.  Cool, thanks.  :)) Holy crap!!!  No one told me don't mix the root beer float mix with the soda!!  Bwahahahaha!!  It was like a mentos and coke explosion!!!  Damn it.  LOL.  We need more napkins!!  Next.. is there anything else I could get you?  Um yea.. we had another accident.   We need more napkins.  Ok  20 napkins later.  We're good. Are you Gil? Yes.  Here. Sets down a mini pazookie with no candle.  Walks away.   Wow.. really??  We come here with 9 people to celebrate our friends birthday and our waitress apparently doesn't have time to sing or even smile!  Hell.. a candle would of been great!  We have been here multiple times before to celebrate birthdays and we've always been sung to.  Matter of fact the other group outside seemed to have had 2 birthdays sung to them.  What are we chop liver?? Fast forward to checks.  Mine has someone else's item.  Theirs is missing it.  Can you fix it?  Waitress (Rachel) states, can you just put the payment in so I can take them.  I have like 6 other tables inside.  WOW!!  So we just settled up with each other and when she came back she decided she would change the bills to the correct bills.  Ugh.. ok, no worries.  OH WAIT!!!  They added on 17% gratuity to the bill.  Now mind you, I don't mind gratuity being added to groups.  Especially when they've gone through the trouble of at least trying to keep our bills separate.  But what is really starting to bother me is waitstaff NOT STATING there has been a 17% gratuity added.  And then to top it off, they have an additional tip spot to tack on a higher tip if desired and total.   Thought about putting a number in there and subtracting it!  WORST SERVICE EVER!!!   Listen BJ's Management.... hire waitstaff that can handle groups or don't give them to the groups and then give them 6 other tables inside!  Apparently Rachel doesn't like that!  Also, its just sneaky.. make it policy that if you have added tip, make the server state the fact.  It makes for good practice and honesty.  Probably the deal breaker for us ever going back.   :( Thanks for letting me share. Here's the break down: Food is a 4. (loved the fish & chips. Root beer floats yummy.  Pizza's ehhh.  Service a 2. (rude, slow and overwhelmed)  Bathrooms 2 (no tp, trash cans over flowing) Atmosphere 3 (light out on patio, one was broken all together) Staff 2 (unfriendly, especially the ones taking their breaks on the patio on their phone) Parking $3.50.  What??",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=300

I hadn't had that experience at other chain restaurants so it was quite lovely for all of us to start eating together.  I didn't  give this place 4 stars because my food didn't taste like much. The presentation was pretty but the taste matters too. Also, the little dishes that are provided for the appetizers were dirty!

Lynn V.,"Granada Hills, Los Angeles, CA",36,84,30,1.0,3/1/2015,"The only reason why I went to this location was because it was a coworkers going away dinner. We did a reservation for 18 people and did call two days ahead of time. You would think the management would be decent enough on holding a table for 18 at 6PM. I understand that most chains/restaurants are busy, but what's the point of reserving if we're going to end up waiting the exact same time as people who just come in?  Anyways, our reservation was at 6, but they decided to sit people in that area and they obviously can't kick people out of the restaurant (which is understandable), but when you have a reservation and we warned them we got 18 people. I think those tables should of been saved at least by 5PM.  So we pretty much waited for our table for about an hour and a half Yes, an hour and a half to get seated. Let me just name the issues we had at this place in numerical order. 1) We got to our table around 7:30. Thank you for the ""complimentary appetizers"", but this doesn't sum up to your customer service. 2)It took over 10 minutes just to get our drinks. 3)We sat at our table staring at each other because we couldn't find our waiter and didn't take our orders about 30 minutes later. 4) Food took about 45 minutes - 1 hour to get to us. The 1 hour entree was done, but given to a different table....and when the entree came, it was made incorrectly.  We spoke to a guy in a plaid shirt and all he said was ""okay.""

She asked the waiter why they didn't have fountain soda water and he said I thought you wanted mineral water, she replied that she wanted either or, as she originally told him.  We placed our order right after.  I ordered my favorite buffalo chicken pizza no ranch, my friend ordered a buffalo chicken pizza no ranch no onions and my other friend ordered the BJ's special (I believe it is called)pizza.  I also placed an order for avocado rolls.  We got the avocado rolls like 10 minutes later, awesome, while we wait for our pizzas!   It was around 10:35 when the waiter came out to tell us that they had burnt our pizzas and they were working on getting new ones out....we were already flustered for waiting so long, but whatever at least he came to tell us.  We got our pizzas and mine or my friend looked NOTHING like the buffalo chicken pizza (as we order this frequently) it had chicken, bacon, cheddar, and who knows what else..... def not what I ordered, but was not going to ask for a replacement and wait 45 more minutes!  I told the waiter that that is not what I had ordered and he swore it was, he said there was nothing else he could do... wtf? ... the the ""buffalo chicken"" pizzas not what we asked for the the BJ special pizza was cold!  We were so upset and disappointed!  This has never happened here!  The waiter told us he spoke the manager and that our meal was comped.  We ate what we could as my pizza still had some burnt on it... and left, but before we left we spoke to the manager and he didn't seem to be in the know prior to the incident.  I hate when you plan on a good meal and it turns out to be a disaster!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=300

When thy bf and I walked to the counter to check in, the lady w/ the curly hair didn't even look up but instead said, ""I'll be right w/ you"" typing away at her computer. You can tell she can't work well under pressure caz she was short w/ the other hosts. Waited a good 20 mins before getting seated which we didn't mind since we were keeping up with our FanDuel line ups. Woohoo for winning that night btw. Our server was pretty average. None of your above and beyond for the extra tip moolah type. Took our orders and left. Pretty much saw her only 5 times; introduction, took our order, called her to give us ranch, gave our bill and took our money. Womp womp. Food was AWEFUL! Here's our order: - New Orleans Jambalaya / Worst ever. Thy bf says it tasted like wood haha - Calamari / Should've been called small calamari rings w/ a giant ball of deep fried batter - BJ something burger / MORE no bueno b/c how can anyone do bacon wrong???? These people can!  - Strawberry splash / Should be strawberry crap b/c wth WAS that crap? I'm sorry, $9.50 for that small amount of alcohol w/ whatever strawberry jam stuff and whip is not worth it. Should've just gotten a shot of vodka and call it a day. - Some BJ specialty beer Total of $56 bad food.  Save the money and go to any other restaurant chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=360

Courtney L.,"Encino, Los Angeles, CA",36,15,9,1.0,7/28/2016,"I went last night for a friend's birthday dinner. Our waiter was Brett G. We were a party of 10 people. I've never in my life had such horrible service at any restaurant, like I did last night. I was disrespected as a customer and I will never come back here. After being seated, 15mins go by to order drinks. He messed up our drink order, with no apology. After that, another 15-20 mins to get an order for appetizers. Another 20min goes by, we want to order our meals, hes nowhere. Up to this point, he never checked on us to see how we're doing or for refills on drinks. We finally order our meals, my boyfriend ordered a Medium bbq chicken pizza. When food was brought out, a ""mini"" bbq chicken pizza was brought out. No apology, & he went to get a new pizza. Everyone else finished eating before his pizza was brought out. The pizza came out all doughy with barely any toppings. I called his attention for a box, and with attitude he brought one. I also said our service was really bad. We all needed refills and he never asked the entire table. He defended himself and said, ""I did ask everyone, you just weren't paying attention"". He was very rude the entire time we were there. Being extremely busy as a waiter is understandable, but there's absolutely no excuse for his rude behavior to a customer. I did ask another waitress if I can talk to a manager, but no one ever came. This type of experience needs to be addressed to the waiter himself and all staff. If you are short staffed, I get it, but at least let us know before you start our orders so we would be aware. But don't ignore us the whole time. I will never go back to this BJs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=360

Ryan M.,"Orange County, CA",909,913,3414,2.0,10/13/2013,"It's very rare that I give One-Star rating to a business, but when a very important person in my life wanted to enjoy dinner with her son and service is lacking, then the low rating is deserved. This is for BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse in Burbank. Usually, once a week, I take my mother out to dinner to catch up. I had been frequenting the Burbank area more often and I had already gone Barney's Beanery. So, I wanted to try out BJ's Restaurant & Brewery. Its located just a couple blocks south of Barney's, but right next door to Black Angus. You have two parking options: Valet or Self-Parking. It will be quite tight at the entrance and exit if you have a pickup truck. My mother and I had come in during a Thursday Night Football Game and ALDS Game. We were seated at third booth from the entrance just at the wall of the bar area. The lady who seated us told us that our server would be right with us. After five minutes, I was wondering where our waiter/waitress was. In about 10-15 minutes, three different parties were seated and their drinks ordered. I flagged down the next waitress that would walk down the aisle. I got a waitress and I told her that this was unacceptable for my mother and I to wait. She said that she didn't know where the waitress for the area was, but she was the only one serving the area. So, that did not make any sense. She had served three other tables, but neglected my table. I continued on to be a customer because my mother wanted to enjoy her meal with me. However, I was already upset by the fact that the other tables were served their drinks and food and it seemed like we just walked in right after. Normally, I would just walk out, but I wanted to see if there were any other pros that would make this up. There was just one. My mother just a lemonade ($2.75) and I ordered a BJ's Irish Root Beer ($8.25). The reason why I ordered the BJ's Irish Root Beer was because, she saw a review next to the drink with the name: Ryan M. So I ordered because she spotted it out. Right after ordering our drinks, I told the waitress I am not waiting any more and order right now. I ordered the Best Beginnings Appetizer ($16.95) and Crispy Thin Fries ($3.25).  I still was quite upset and to tell you the truth, the food didn't calm me down. Best Beginnings was very delicious. Best Beginnings had Spinach & Artichoke Dip with chips, Avocado Egg Rolls, Santa Fe Spring Rolls, and Mozzarella Sticks. Each had their own sauce which can compliment any food. Sometimes, I would dip the french fries in the sauce to mix it up. As I mentioned before, I was still upset and the food did not do the job. The waitress was who did take our orders was going on break. I did get her name, but her replacement, Lidia did better job in a few moments than the previous server. So, its not a one star review, but a two star, just for Lidia. I am not sure if she was aware of the situation before she took over. She complimented my watch and asked for my million dollar autograph when I forgot to sign the check. She deserved the tip because she did her job very well. The incident happened a few days ago and I emailed BJ's Corporate Office for a response. Let's see what happens. I was not particularly fond of what happened, but I couldn't show it to my mother. I know it was a memorable moment for my mom, but for me it was a service nightmare. So, I won't be coming back here until I get a response from BJ's Corporate Office and see how they can correct this service flaw. Yelp!

Jack H.,"Los Angeles, CA",757,495,2432,4.0,11/13/2014,"My wife and I go to BJ's once in a while for our date night.  They USUALLY a have good food and good service.  There is nothing outrageously great or bad about this place.  It's a cool spot to go and kick back for dinner.  I love their outdoor seating and they've recently changed it which makes it more likable.  Service is usually good, except last night.  We went and had a server, Maria, that was not very attentive.  Our waitresses kept changing which was weird cause one would bring out our food and I was ask for something that wasn't initially brought to us by Maria, and she wouldn't say 'I'll get your waitress for you.   What the heck?! Lol. Like they didn't want to do their jobs or something.  Then they brought my wife soup in a bread bowl when my wife didn't want it in a bread bowl.  Anyways, other than last nights service, their service is usually good, friendly, happy servers.  Food is good and has consistency.  It's not like your going to order the same thing and not sure if it's made well or not.  If you like a nice place to go and kick back, BJ's would totally be recommended.

James H. L.,"Los Angeles, CA",176,149,33,3.0,11/12/2014,"With Elephant Bar closed, BJ's is our local go-to for lunchtime catering when we burn out from burgers and need a wide variety menu. Service has always been excellent wherever seated (and the place is quite big for huge parties, if needed.) Bar area has lots of TV's for sports, if that's your need of the moment.  The food is pretty much middle-middle. Nothing really bad, nothing constantly craveable. I seem to like the entree salads the best of the mix, especially their version of the crispy chicken style. Standard pizookies (chocolate chip, peanut butter, caramel) seem best. Their seasonal ones are kind of hit and miss. The Chicago-style pizza never quite has been close, but it's a puffy crust semi-deep dish style that's edibly filling, as long as you're not expecting Giordano's. Fries come both julienne thin and wedge cuts, and are pretty good when topped with the works (chili, cheese, bacon, etc.) or the new Carnitas Fries with Chile Verde version. Have had fun with a Double Deluxe burger - which is best split into 2 open-faced versions since thats about 2/3 of a pound of meat. Not really a date night kind of place, but more like I want more like a Marie Callendar's without pie. Not Claim Jumper or Cheesecake Factory portions, but bigger than average. Vegetarians/Vegans might find it tough here - stuck with salads holding the cheese and bacon bits, or the some of their soups.  Beers are plentiful and include the microbrews and a fun sampler flight. Full bar, otherwise. Of course, Biersch, BBG, Black Angus, Barney's, Granville,   are up the street, so you could go nuts at happy hours bouncing from bar to bar to bar to bar to bar in downtown Burbank.  But for a sit-down-watch-the-game over huge nachos, or bring the whole family for a one-size-fits-all menu - no problem here. The valet parking has to do with the proximity to the big office buildings next door tending to take extra spaces whenever they can get them (none of the 1st street business buildings seem to actually have enough parking for ALL of their tenants). For evenings, you could always walk from across the street from the BofA parking, or any of the multitude of free parking multi-story lots if you're doing a night on the town in Burbank.

They don't accept credit card, only cash and they would like a tip on top of it. We arrived about 8:30pm and it was packed which is typical for any restaurant on a Friday night which is fine. We waited for about 30 minutes and were seated. We got a corner table which was ideal since there was 4 in our party with 2 kids under 5  years old. We were greeted right away by our server and got our drinks rather quickly. It wasn't until we ordered our food, our server had to take a break and we were given a new waitress. That's when our experience went down hill from there. It took 30 minutes for us to get 2 small pizzas, 1 pasta order and a kids mac n cheese. The food was cold. We didn't have any silverware.  We asked the guy who brought us the food for them, didn't see him again. Had to ask another server for them. We saw our waitress 1 time after that and we had to track her down to order 1 pizookie. That took another 30 minutes for us to get. Then we had to wait another 20 minutes from when we finished everything to ask for 3 to go boxes, wait for those and wait again for the check and had to wait more to get change from the bill. It was just not a great experience. The service was bad, the food was awful and the valet was a rip off. No other restaurant does that in Burbank.

Brandon G.,"Burbank, CA",59,2,,2.0,1/14/2015,"If I had to summarize my entire experience, it would be blah. I saw on   that BJ's was running a promotion for buy one entree get one free. I saw the yelp reviews were pretty low, so I went in with VERY LOW expectations. I figured I would just have a nice Tuesday night dinner, and it'll be pretty middle of the road, but overall decent experience. I walked and get seated. The bar looked great, the actual interior of the restaurant is very nice and fun, lots of tvs, nice art/wall features etc. We're seated, my waiter was very nice dude, but when I asked what he recommended, he didn't really seem like an expert on the menu. I asked what he liked, he just told me what he saw go out of the kitchen a lot, and he basically just read off the menu the descriptions of dishes etc. So that wasn't that reassuring. I ordered one of their pizzas, half BJ's special or whatever they call it (it's their ""famous"" combination) and half chicken bacon ranch as just something ""out of the box."" My girlfriend ordered seared scallops, so I figured it would be a pretty easy 2 dishes to knock out. I ordered a beer, and it took 10 minutes for it to show up, and it was served in the cold glass, but  the beer wasn't TOO cold. I've never waited that long for a beer to be poured into a glass, and then it's not at a proper temperature? I can deal with the wait if they were slammed, but this is a Tuesday night. There was a decent amount of people in the bar area, but the rest of the restaurant was empty. Also the temperature of the beer is not the servers fault, but more of the brewmaster, bartender, or whoever was in charge of the kegs. Besides the wait and the temperature, the beer was OK, nothing great, but if it was at a colder temperature, it would be much more enjoyable.  When we got the food (which came in a reasonable amount of time compared to the beer), I was immediately disappointed with the quality. My pizza, although advertised as deep dish pizza, was really a pan pizza (with actually pretty thin-for-pan pizza size) absolutely covered in toppings. Every square inch had some sort of pepper, pepperoni, sausage etc. And the toppings were very meh in general, nothing really too fresh, the chunks of tomato's on the Bj's signature side tasted like they were canned or preserved or something, it just didn't taste fresh. The dough was also very doughy (not too crisp) and flavorless. I mean, the pizza wasn't terrible to eat or anything, but for $20 price tag its insanely overpriced. It really really reminded me of Pizza Hut quality, except sloppily put together. That's right, a phoned in Pizza Hut pizza with a $20 price tag. Yuck. My girlfriends scallops were an absolute joke in terms of size. They were pretty rubbery consistency, and were VERY small and thing, as if they sliced them in half to yield more on the plate. Again, the taste of the scallops weren't BAD, but the ingredients and the amount of food were less than average, mediocre at best. Overall, even with the promotion, I would have rather gone somewhere else for dinner that night. I think it's complete garbage that those entrees were $20 (for the pizza) and $15 (for the scallops) when you use terrible ingredients, sloppy presentation, which screams to me overall cheap business practices. My service was decent, the waiter was nice and friendly, but he wasn't that knowledgeable about the menu, and the beer was very average for a place that supposedly has signature beers. Personally, it offends me for a restaurant to fool people that it's more high end eating and cheap out on the execution. I can go down the street and pay half the price and go to places with nice food.  There are much better options in downtown Burbank to eat... go to any of those other places. ANY OF THEM. If you want to go to a place similar to BJ's but uses good ingredients, go to Gordon Biersch on San Fernando, which has similar prices but MUCH better selection and ingredients (like night and day difference.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=320

Ronald A.,"Oceanside, CA",129,75,37,1.0,1/20/2015,"This being a chain restaurant, I would assume the place is pretty consistent with other BJ's locations. After eating here, I can see why this particular location has a low rating.  The Bad:  They messed up our order. I asked for 1/2 medium great white, 1/2 BJ's favorite.  What we received was 1/2 Mediterranean, 1/2 Bj's favorite. I didn't notice until halfway through eating the pizza (since I started with the Bj's favorite. I noticed it right away because The mediterranean slice had some peppers and was a little spicy, and i do not like Spice. I asked our server if there was a mistake, and she admitted that the pizza she brought wasn't the pizza we ordered (although she entered it correctly).  She called the manager, and the manager asked us what happened and in his exact words ""what can we do to fix it?"" I just asked for a small great white pizza, since that was exactly what I was craving.  It arrived, and we ate it. At the end, the bill comes, and I noticed we were charged for the small great white. No discount, didn't remove the wrong pizza we received. NOTHING. I don't really see the point of bringing the manager over.  The Good:  The food is tasty. When we received our correct order, it was delicious.  In short,  I don't appreciate getting the wrong order and even after admitting it was incorrect, the staff doing nothing to fix it.  Before dining here, I didn't bother to read reviews because I've always had great experiences in the past with this Chain restaurant. Now, I can see why this place has such a low rating.

We arrived promptly at our pre-selected time. When we walked in, there was another couple waiting at the front. It was obvious they had not even been greeted yet. In the 5 minutes it tool for someone to finally acknowledge either of our existences, two employees stood at the take-out desk and did not say a word or look for anyone to help the people standing there for so long. Several other employee's walked by at that time without even a hello. The hostess finally showed up and could barely finish a sentence, it was bad. So we get our seats, have our server take our drink order (we had ordered the food in the app already). He bring our fries and leave, we had also ordered chili. About 5 minutes later he comes back and asks us if we also ordered soup. We confirmed and 5 minutes later finally got that as well. Did not see him again until we were ready to go. Further, he too seemed to be unable to talk very coherently. My guest and I were quite  sure most of the staff had been partaking in some booze on a slow night. Will not be back and could not possibly recommend this location to anyone. Third bad experience in a row and we are DONE! I guess this did not get posted the other day.

Vicki M.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,17,1,1.0,8/16/2016,"We were here 2 days ago for dinner. My great nephew wanted to come for his 18th birthday. There were 7 in our group. We waited a short time to be seated, then we were lead back into a corner booth by a side door and a server station. It was over 100 degrees out and most uncomfortable where we where sat. People kept going in and out of the door, letting the heat in. No air flow back there.    It took awhile for our server to come to our table, were he said he would be right back. He came back and took our drink order, one was wrong. It was corrected. He took our order. About 30 mins later, he brought over a server who he said was relieving him for a break. Another 20 mins later...still no food!!! We called over someone to check on our food. About 10 more mins the food started coming out one by one. It was like our food sat for a long time and was reheated, because the sandwiches had hard crust edges and the ham was hard! The kids pizzas had cheese melted in the plate. My potato wedge fries were burnt to a crisp! Should have taken a picture. They brought out some new ones, but they were taste less. Finally, the last pizza arrived almost 10 mins after the first person was eating.     There was no apology from our server or reason why this happened. We finally had the manager come over and by then I had already told the server to bring me my ticket, cuz I did my meal on a separate check. I had been there way too long and needed to drive a home, which was 30 minutes. I knew the rest of my group wanted to get dessert for the birthday boy, but I had to go. The manager said he could give us a gift card to make up for the poor experience, but since my card had already been ran he could not help me. The rest of the bunch got a $25 card for a bill that was over $90, not including tip. Unfortunately, I will not be going back there, and I was born and raised in Burbank. Bob's Big is always good, but no beer served.

Stephh F.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,24,14,3.0,3/25/2016,"Yes most of these reviews are right service is usually always slow, sometimes the waiter/waitress is super nice sometimes they seem like they do not want to be there at all. So service is 2 out of 5 stars just because of the few friendly ones. The food used to be the best I've ever had even in more expensive restaurants. Their cheddar mashed potatoes are always great as well as the grilled asparagus and I can't forget the white chocolate macadamia nut pazookie. However, I used to absolutely LOVE the rib eye steak. It was never even close to being bad but recently these past couple of months the steak is usually disappointing. Sometimes it's ok but most of the time is dry and flavorless or cooked to well (I ask for medium) and rarely do they make it amazing like before. I've even sent back the steak a couple of times and it would still come back horrible. Food used to be 5 out of 5 stars now it's barely a 2 just because of the delicious side dishes and desert.  The beer on the other hand never disappoints, I always get the  jerramiah red (something like that) and at first it tasted kinda funky but now I crave it once in a while and would even come here just for the beer. So 4 stars on that. Last is the wait time before being seated, the parking lot is a little weird valet is only 3.50 but most of the time unnecessary. And what a lot of people don't know is that you can call in to be put in the wait list as long as you get there within 30 minutes. I usually do that and get seated within 10 minutes of going in or sometimes right away. Plus the girls in the front desk are usually very friendly.

When we informed our server about this, she brought us dried red pepper flakes (the thing you put on your pizza) after 10 minutes. That didn't help. So we asked for hot sauce (another 5 mins) and barely finished half of the plate.

Entrees: You really can't go wrong with the food. Pastas, Seafood, Burgers, Salads, etc. You're almost sure to find something you like. My friend and I both got burgers and sandwiches, and they came out really good. I was offered the option of thin-cut or wedge fries, I chose thin cut, but they came out with wedges instead.

On our drive down I was all like ""Mmm...I smell greasy Cheese Burger. I want me some greasy Cheese Burger.

Our meal started off with some of the Calamari and dipping sauce.  Then to our main dishes which where the Bacon Cheese burger for me, and a patty melt for her.  Both with the potato wedges and some dipping sauce.   To drink I had the Cream Soda which was really tasty, and my girlfriend had a few cocktails.   The food was good, the service was fast, and the Atmosphere was quiet considering there were a few groups of people inside throughout the restaurant.  Our waiter was pretty helpful and stopped by to check on us a few times, and offer some suggestions on appetizers, drinks, and desserts.

Andy L.,"Pacoima, CA",283,220,6,2.0,2/17/2014,"Used to come here a lot for the food back in high school and everything was great, would have gave them 4 stars back then. Went back recently for lunch and sever dinners, all pretty lackluster experinces.  Food: Same as with any other BJs really. Usually go with a burger or the pulled pork sandwich, if it's a large party we usually grab a couple pizzas and share. Burgers are juicy and delicious, the sandwich is also great, might be my favorite thing there. Pizzas to be honest isn't that good, crust is a little thick and there is very little topping. Toppings arent spread out evenly so someone can have like no crust and lots of topping when someone else ends up with all crust. The beers are tasting, big fan of the Piranha Red. And of course the pizookie, thing is delicious. Keep in mind the party platter is tempting to get but it is rather huge, takes about a good 6-8 people to finish.  Service: Here's where the downfall of this particular BJs. Service used to be good and consistent no matter the time or rush. Now the service is poor even when its not crowded. Food takes a while to come out and not everything is brought out at once, some orders are messed up and drinks take awhile to be refilled. And before all that the seating process is a little unorganized. They tell us 15 mins but then after those 15 mins they tell us another 10 and it continues for a few more times.  Location: Pretty good location right off the 5 freeway. Also kind of away from the more congested area of Burbank. Once you enter you are met by the valet drivers, you can leave your car to them for a couple bucks or you can drive pass them and find self parking on the second floor of the structure. Be careful of the ramp leading up to the second floor, its a little tight and steep.

Jim K.,"Burbank, CA",0,30,,1.0,12/30/2016,"BJ's has a chronic problem with service. I have been in this restaurant numerous times and the service has always been slow but last night it was shambolic. We were a party of nine, got seated almost immediately and the place wasn't particularly busy. The service was typically slow but within the realms of being tolerable. However, when our food eventually arrived, the items that come with fries were served without the fries and our server explained the fries were not ready but would be out shortly. So four of us sat there with half our meal, one of the meals was supposed to be fish AND chips (which didn't come with tartar sauce). The fries did eventually get served. One diner ordered a steak, cooked medium and it was served rare so that had to go back to the kitchen. We waited ages and had to ask our server where the steak was before he fetched it and by that time everyone else had finished eating. There were a lot of other fairly minor things that spoiled the experience but I won't list them. We complained to the manager and she was very apologetic and deducted the four items that came with fries from our check. The food was decent, the server was doing his best but he was new and it wasn't entirely his fault.

Rick S.,"Redondo Beach, CA",541,1619,11938,3.0,6/10/2013,"BJ's is a reliable chain, the pizza is okay, but the deep dish is not similar to the Chicago styled pizza I've seen replicated at Zachary's in the Bay Area, in that it's more like thick crust than a saucy pie, but if you like a greater ratio of dough/bread than the thinner crust, and like your pizza soft, then you may love the pizza  for those properties. I had the Jambalaya which is $15.95 and is a generous portion with sausage, chicken and shrimp and has mild spices, so not too hot (you can add your own hot sauce if you want to too) and is zesty enough to appreciate the flavors without the heat killing the dish, which is what I like. The french fries are thin ('tho they offer wedge versions too) and have the look and taste that makes me think they're fresh cut (as opposed to frozen), which is always nice. The hamburgers, I believe they cook to order, or at least ask you how you'd like it, which is always nice.  It's a decent size too (and comes with fries). The Poke (Ahi/Tuna) dish was good, and has a generous portion of fish with avocado on crisp crackers. The waiting system is buzzer/pager based and the wait isn't that bad when they're crowded.  The service is good, and the positions of the TV's are good, so you don't get a neck cramp trying to look at a TV screen, since there are pretty much TV's from every angle, which is nice. It's located in the more busy part of Burbank, near the Media Center area, and they do have a parking lot, either pay $3.50 for Valet, or there's free, but limited (however achievable with the right timing, patience and parking karma) FREE parking in the adjacent structure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=380

Parking was tricky. I was lucky to get a spot at the limited self parking lot. There's valet service or you can park elsewhere a block or two away to save money. A Metrolink station is nearby, although I generally don't use Metrolink since trains only arrive only once or twice an hour. Good variety of food and drinks available for Happy Hour including mini deep dish pizza which was decent but not like the deep dish you get at Chicago.

It has everything one could want for lunch. The sports games never have the sound on. FYI. No subtitles either but who goes to bars to read anyway?   Pizookies are what you want to order.

First off, forced valet.  Grr.  I hate that. I know it's necessary at times but it's a layer of annoyance that will deter me from coming here.   Secondly, food was just ok.  I had the Cobb salad (ok, but missing key elements of a Cobb salad, it was more of a hybrid salad) and clam chowder.  I took a spoonful of chowder and looked at my spoon- chocolate was embedded on the soup spoon.  Gross.  Those pizookies are pretty popular I take it, but not mixed in with clam chowder.  Took awhile to flag someone down to replace it.  My coworkers food all looked fairly ok though.  Burger, BBQ platter, chicken pasta dish.  Maybe I should have gotten one of those dishes.  One of my coworkers is all about their beer, and at the end of our meal found out he could buy a bottle.  Our server charged him separately, no problem. However the server then disappeared for about 25 min while we all wondered if he would come back with this bottle of beer.  He finally appeared with the bottle of beer, so we could finally leave, with little explanation of why it took so long.   There's so many options in downtown Burbank for this kind of food, so I'm bummed that this place couldn't wow me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=480

First, they only have valet parking, but I thought to myself it was sort of nice for a day of celebration.  We were seated right away. Our waiter was nice and took our order promptly. I decided to order their BLT salad but with no cheese. I was very clear about the no cheese part and was repeated several times by me and others.  Food comes and I get a salad with cheese...lol. OK I'm a little confused but I understand these things happen so I just alerted the waiters and asked for a new salad. Well, that was a mistake because it came when everyone else had finished eating and me enjoying watching them eat. By this time my niece had also been waiting for syrup for her cold pancakes. I alerted a waiter about this and after she gave me the ""wait a minute"" she came back and said she would tell the supervisor about this issue. Well, I did not have to pay for my salad, which was nice.

Stephen O.,"Sunland, CA",13,18,9,1.0,1/4/2014,"If I rated this two years ago, I might've gave it around 4 stars. However, lately as many reviewers have experienced, this place has gone downhill.  Food and service is pathetic. 4 out of the last 6 times I've been there, at least 1 of the people at my table has not gotten something they ordered. I usually like the BBQ beef sandwich but 2 out of 4 times they come out with the BBQ pulled pork and tell me their computer is messed up. I'm allergic to pork so good thing I know the difference in how they look before I take a bite.  That dish also comes with wedge cut fries, which some days you'll get about 8 fries total. It's really pathetic looking even on the small dish it comes along with the sandwich on.  My last trip (ever) was last week when my friend didn't get his beer for 35 minutes, and then when my table got all our food they said his was on it's way.... After 20 minutes and the whole table was feeling bad about eating in front of him without his food, we still were basically finished with all our meals when they brought out his burger and fries out.  He took one bite of the wedge cut fry and spit it out like something was wrong. He said something wasn't right and we all smelled them and compared them to someone else's and they smelled like burnt hair or burnt plastic. We actually took 2 home in a ziplock bag  like CSI in case he got sick. The next morning they smelled fine. Overall this place gets tons of business and is always crowded for big events and yada yada, but their food is awful, and their service is non-existent just like the marinara sauce they were suppose to put on top of my brother's spaghetti.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=480

Even by chain restaurant standards, BJ's is only okay. It's loud, but the service was fine. The drinks were good and reasonably priced enough. But the food was generic, and fairly bland. I had shrimp scampi pasta, which was much heavier and less tasty than I'm used to getting elsewhere. My boyfriend got a pizza though, and he was really happy with it. I agree with other reviewers that it's a bit overpriced for the quality.  We got dessert, though, and it was the bees knees. A+ in that department.

Destiny C.,"Glendale, CA",60,253,51,3.0,8/30/2013,"I visited this location yesterday with my daughter and the bf. Three things stood out to us; the hostess, our server and our food.  Our visit started off and ended poorly with the hostess. She seemed distracted and made us feel unimportant... like, she had better things to do than greet us. There was no one else standing in the waiting area so I'm not sure what she could have possibly been distracted by. Then again, when we left the restaurant she didn't bother acknowledging our presence. She brushed past us... as if she still had something better to do. She wasn't with a guest either time that we encountered her so there really is no excuse for her rudeness and lack of... hosting. Someone yelled across the restaurant to thank us as we were leaving so we weren't the only ones who noticed her complete lack of friendliness.   Unfortunately, our pizza was pretty terrible. I am a big fan of BJs pizza and was very disappointed by what we were served. We ordered an appetizer platter, which was absolutely delicious. The pizza, however, did not live up to the same standard. My 2 year old daughter is a huge fan of pizza (as most toddlers are) and she didn't even eat it. The pizza was grossly lacking in sauce and cheese. It tasted as if we were just eating bread. I can get a large pizza for $5 at a pizza chain. When you walk away from a pizza restaurant having spent $50 on 1 pizza and an appetizer, you expect good pizza. I think this is the first time pizza leftovers have survived breakfast in my home.  The good news is that I was very impressed with our server. His name was David and he was possibly the best server I have ever encountered. I was a server for 7 years, it would be fair to say that I have high standards and David exceeded every one of my expectations. He was incredibly friendly and attentive from the moment he approached us. I cannot say enough about how impressed we were with the level of service he provided.

Matt M.,"Chandler, AZ",10,19,13,1.0,2/27/2016,"Giving BJ's a 1 star for my most recent visit. I placed an order over the phone last night around 755-8pm for curbside pick up. I asked the girl after I finished my order how long it will take, she responded about 15-20 minutes. I go and get there around 820 and call in to say I'm here for pick up. One of the waiters comes and takes my card and says we are running a bit behind, it will be like 5-7 min longer. I go ok another 5-7 min isn't that bad. He comes back 10 min later with my card and says the kitchen is backed up and it will be another 5-7 min. At this point I am contemplating to just cancel this order because it's 840 at this point and it's taking too long. I decide to wait anyway and until 852 I call in to cancel and they said oh it's on it's way out sorry for the wait. They brought the order and for the wait they gave an extra order of fries. Nice but it literally took 1 hour from order inception to pick up. I might as well dined inside had I known it would be that long. Isn't the purpose for curbside pick up to be less of a wait time? I know there are glitches here and there and kitchens run a bit slower, but I believe 50 minutes is too long for curbside.

Jay D.,"Granada Hills, CA",40,2,,1.0,2/9/2014,"From start to finish my experience at this BJs was probably one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had.    As I walked in to the restaurant with my family I knew I should have walked out, but I figured I'd give it a chance.  Starting with the hostess, no smile, no welcome was offered, we weren't even asked how many in our party.  The hostess had the ""I don't want to be here"" look.  Two other hostesses, one may have been the manager, standing there gossiping with her employees.  We were sat down right away which was a plus; however, we had to wait about ten minutes before our waiter took our drink order, by that time we were ready to order our food.  If they are going to make you wait that long at least offer a snack.   So we placed our orders and as I expected the food took some time to arrive.  If you've been to this place you know it's a good size restaurant. The main bar was some what busy, the party room/bar was empty, the dining room we sat in did not look completely full so I'm not sure what could explain the slow and poor service.  Our food wait time was about thirty to forty minutes.  Our waiter came by once to tell us or food was on the window and they were waiting for runners... Really, WTF, you tell me the waiter can't bring us our food.  To top it off, the runner tried to deliver our food to the wrong table, we tried to tell him it was ours but he had to go back and check.   Let's talk about the food, maybe it was the long wait that left a bad taste in my mouth but the food wasn't worth the price.  I ordered a Deep dish buffalo chicken pizza. The dough was good but the pizza looked like it went through spin cycle. Limited toppings, dried up sauce, cold from sitting on the window probably fifteen minutes.  The wife ordered a salmon dish. Of course it was cold and the flavor bland... You could smell the curry but couldn't taste it.  My son had the chicken scampe.  This one was OK taste wise a bit cold.  Service throughout was nonexistent. Asked waiter for Tabasco and a refill... Took a good seven minutes to get the refill and I never got the sauce. Not sure about this place maybe they had an off day but I doubt it.  You can't hide poor service.  Probably why half the place was empty during lunch hours.   If you decide to visit this establishment I hope your experience is much better than mine...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=420

The wait time was only 2 minutes even though they were tremendously busy, props to the table turn around ratio for that one. Only reason I took off a star was because of the ticket time... The kitchen was taking awhile. 30 minutes for 3 dishes? Seems crazy. I know it's hard to plan for the right number of cooks, but it seemed as if we were waiting for awhile. The manager even came by to another one of Alec's table to apologize about their food taking so long (even longer than ours). How can they expect table turn around ratios at a faster rate of the food is taking too long to get out? Anyways, thank you for a great night, BJ's and Alec.

My last visit may be my last. I understand that it was really busy, Friday night, etc. It took my waiter 25 minutes to make his presence at our table. The pictures on the menu of the food are very deceiving (my mozarella and tomato salad was half of what I thought it would be) and the portions are super small, yet the food is so expensive. What I did have here though, was very good.  We sat by the bar, which was a huge mistake. This place is where drunk men that are going through midlife crisis' go to to be loud and annoying. I almost put an axe to the chair he was sitting in so he could fall and hopefully hit his head. Not to mention, the stuff he was talking about LOUDLY was quite inappropriate. Had I had kids with me I would have taken it upon myself to tell him to shut the hell up or leave. I really do think that the staff at this place should have taken it upon themselves to ask him to shut up or to leave. None of them said a single word to him.

The waiter that was taking our order was an excellent waiter with lots of potential but due to the lack of support he wasn't able to do his job well. We ordered our food and drinks and it took over 1 hour and a half to get our food because the kitchen was ""backed up"" but the place was not busy at all.  When the food came out it seemed like they downgraded in their quality of how they used to make their food. They use minimal of everything from toppings on pizzas to the ranch they give you.

I'm thinking that was their intention. It's a marketing gimmick to bring attention to the establishment. I know how this works. I was a marketing minor in college... Well, job well done BJ's! Hahaha BJ's ;)  Anyway, putting my immature 12 year old version of myself aside; the BJ's location in Huntington Beach was one of my first reviews on Yelp. It was so horrible; I gave it one star, emailed the corporate BJ's, and swore off the establishment for life. Tonight, I ventured to BJ's in Burbank with some other Yelpers (Val, Jessica, and Anthony) and can say that Mr. BJ gained back some love (I'm still weary but I'll give it SOME credit).  The Burbank location is very spacious with several eating areas and two bars. The seating resembles a cafeteria in size and layout so don't be surprised if you feel the need to look for the ""popular kids"" or the ""computer nerds"" and revert back to high school. We ordered the Pizookie Platter with half chocolate chip and half Oreo and the Beer Sampler. The Beer Sampler included about 8 or so varieties of beer ranging from light Belgian-like beers to dark twins of Guinness. The waitress politely explained each and even asked later in the evening which we liked, etc. An excellent way to find a beer you like for your next visit or feel like a beer connoisseur to impress your friends. The pizookie was fresh, soft, and MUCH better than the raw cookie dough at the Huntington Beach location. Overall, a much better treat which we engulfed like children.

I was going to order the Pizookie Trio, but my friend wasn't up to the challenge of eating a pizookie and a half by herself so we just got a regular chocolate chunk pizookie.  I sat there waiting in anticipation for the yummy gooey goodness to arrive. It was like one of those moments out of a movie where everything moves in slow motion and the light seems to shine a little brighter like a spotlight on the waitress as she makes her way to our table.  The ice cream was slowly melting so I dug right in.  Pizookies are absolutely amazing and I was VERY happy. My waitress was helpful, a little slow but super nice.  There was a little 10 year old boy in the booth next to us who kept waving at me and even gave me a show using his hands as puppets.  All in all, I had a wonderful experience at BJ's and will definitely be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=540

The BBQ platter was sub par. It tasted like the meat had been reheated. We didn't even finish our plate, we were so unsatisfied. Add on to the fact that our platter was the last plate to make it to the table. Waaaay after our group was finishing up their meals. Turns out that our first dish was overcooked, so they had to prepare another one. Yet, we were never notified of the incident until we complained. Our server had left us in the care of another server because he was going on break. This new server blew. When we complained to him, he said he'd bring it up to the manager. The manager came over, apologized and offered a pazookie for our troubles. That's it?! So we complained again. Another manager came and comped us our two appetizers. Now we're talking. Customer service means that you keep your customer happy. If they have to wait until their dinner party finishes eating to get their meal, then you now have a problem. Your next move is to fix it.

Caresse V.,"San Diego, CA",72,38,65,5.0,1/20/2015,"The PARKING:  When you pull in, you have the option to valet for $3.50 or to take your chance at self parking on the top floor of a 2 story parking complex that is right across from the restaurant driveway.  The most time I usually spend looking for a spot is a minute, max.   The WAIT: Our average wait time is 5 minutes give or take.  Sometimes we are seated right away.  Bottom line is I have never had to wait past 20 minutes (For 2 of us). The PLACE: The restaurant has a great layout.  It's perfect for dates, big groups and game nights. The FOOD:  I have ordered so many items from the menu but I'll mention a few that I love and a couple that are...meh. Appetizers - My favorite appetizer is the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms.  They're mouth watering good.  The mushrooms are juicy and the spinach filling is full of savory cheesy goodness.  The lemon pesto sauce is a beautiful compliment to the mushrooms.  I have to plead with myself not to lick the plate clean, lest I lose my date's interest. lol...  My second favorite is the Ahi Poke.  The tuna is fresh and the poke sauce is to die for!  Lastly, the hot wings.  The hot wings are great.  They are crispy with a nice light salty batter with sauce on the side.  The celery is fresh and the ranch is a good quality.  The wings are great to share and pair well with pretty much all of their beer choices. Entrees - My favorite entree has to be the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi.  The glazed mahi mahi is oven roasted and served over stir-fried vegetables and roasted pineapple fried rice mixed with a spicy soy ginger sauce then topped with slivered snow peas, red bell peppers and sesame seeds.  The fish is always cooked perfectly.  The rice mixture is sweet and savory and light.  During my last visit I decided to try the Prime Rib (Just under $20).  I asked for it to be served medium rare.  I ordered it with seasonal veggies and cheese mashed potatoes.  When it came out, it was well done, the potatoes were fine but the veggies were under cooked and were 90% sliced carrots, green beans and Asian peas.  Normally, I don't care and I will eat whatever they give me.  But at $20, I really wanted something I would enjoy so after showing the waitress the steak (she saw the issue right away and offered to get it fixed) I asked her if they could give me rice pilaf instead of the veggies.  They were so kind and apologetic about it.  After the waitress left with my plate, the manager stopped by and apologized as well.  He was really awesome.  When it came out, the waitress asked me to check it while she was there, so I cut into it and it was PERFECT.  I mean, the steak could be in an educational book to show exactly what medium rare should look like.  It tasted, awesome!  The taste was something that merits being a $40 steak.  It had really good seasoning and was so juicy.  The rice pilaf was scrumptious as well.  It was cooked perfectly and had a really yummy chicken broth taste.  The potatoes (while a bit pasty for my liking) were very tasty as well.   Dessert - The Pazookies are a must when you come to BJ's. The cookie is fresh out of the oven and the ice cream is so creamy!  I am always too full to get one after a meal, so I will go JUST FOR ONE .  If you haven't tried it, you must! In conclusion, there are many awesome dish choices at BJ's, but I love this location for it's fantastic customer service and for their awesome chef.  Thank you and Bon Apetit!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=500

The Malibu teriyaki glaze on the wings was delicious,  but both entrees came out barely warm... like it was sitting out for a while.

Eric W.,"Canoga Park, CA",166,672,148,3.0,2/7/2010,"The biggest complaint I have about this BJ's location is the parking.  It's a narrow driveway that essentially requires valeting the car and the non-valet structure (top only) is a really small lot. I had to choose a restaurant for a work lunch and chose this restaurant because I like it and I knew everyone could find something they want.  I've been several other times too including with my girlfriend and we had really good meals with solid service.  The food is usually really good -- their menu is super diverse from sandwiches, salads, pasta and pizza.  Their micro brews are really good too.   I had one error on a visit here.  We had just been to a USC football game and came for a dinner.  The restaurant messed up our order for a calzone and not only did the manager come over and we got comped on the calzone but they gave us a free dessert.  That made up for the error. The sports bar has a lot of TVs if you can find a seat.  Also, there are several TVs throughout the restaurant to catch a game.  It's also a great place to let kids run wild because it's so big. I'm up for BJ's Restaurant just about always and this location works.  It's not as unique as other restaurants because it's like a high-end Chili's if there is such a thing, but everyone should enjoy it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=620

Cons: - Valet parking during lunch, but it's totally free, and you can park a block away to the south on the street for free, fairly easily. - Pizza doesn't have enough sauce. - Some of the indoor wrap-around booths are uncomfortable to sit at.  Stick with the classic table and chairs, or sit outdoors.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=620

There were no spaces available and when trying to go back to ground level I had no choice but to exit the same way I took going up. There was no separate lane from ongoing and in going traffic.

Made reservations because our party had to be somewhere by 7 and we couldn't afford to be late. Was a little thrown off when we walked in and they said it would be a 15 min wait.  Since it was my mom's birthday and that was where she wanted to eat I was willing to wait. We finally go to get seated and they attempt to put us in a small booth that might have fit 4 adults, mind you our party was 6 adults and two high chairs. We asked to get a different table with a little more room and they told us all the other tables had reservations....the place was practically empty! We asked to speak to the manager. He finally comes out and is rude. He goes on to say we actually didn't have a reservation it was actually considered a call ahead. He said the table they were offering usually fits 7 people. I couldn't help but laugh, there was absolutely no way! The manager made no attempt to even offer us a different table he just wanted to make negative comments towards us that we didn't have reservations.  We walked out and called over to Gordon Biersch. They were able to sit us immediately and they were busy!!! They had great customer service and extremely friendly. We had never been before and our server offered us samples of beer so we could pick what we wanted to order to drink. Had a great atmosphere too! Highly recommend you head to GB over BJs!

Marisa Z.,"Altadena, CA",316,416,111,4.0,1/29/2013,"***Bar Review***     I have never sat in any of the dining rooms at this or any other location. I have always sat at the actual bar or one of the surrounding high top tables. I don't really care about the whole service aspect of the dining room in corporations such as this one. They always seem to coddle you, filled with fake enthusiasm and try to push things on you that you have no desire for. The bar area is easy, laid back, chill. Plus during breaks in conversation, while say your friend went to the restroom, you can catch the scores to every game.      The happy hours are pretty decent here too, there are two of them. One during the traditional hours one would normally be use to seeing post work, as well as the reverse happy hour that starts at 9, i think, and goes til closing.      The food is decent, better than I anticipated actually. The beer is great, I really enjoy the red, and usually stick to this over the others. Although the last time I was there I noticed something new, guest taps!! And quite a lot to boot too. I was surprised as well as curious and made a mental note to look at the list next time.      The service has generally been great, smiling happy servers that seem genuine rather than acting as if they care.     Remember to stop for cash for the valet. The first time I came here I was driving my manual transmission Mustang and opted to park it myself in the structure. The ramp that leads up to the top floor is steep as hell!! I was super thankful that no one was behind me or in front of me. I could have rolled or stalled. It is that steep.

Hank K.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,81,236,2.0,8/5/2012,"We haven't been back here in a long time. The facility is clean and the service is friendly enough. On par with what you expect from a chain.  Although I didn't have any last night, the pizza is the only thing I'd recommend if visiting a BJ's. It's fairly decent but not traditional Chicago style pizza. The best comparison I can make is Pizza Hut's pan pizza (I figure nearly everyone has tried that at least once). Thicker but not as dense with a chunky marinara sauce and overall better ingredients. Whatever you do, DO NOT order that ""Greek"" pizza. One of the worst pizza's I've tried in my lifetime. Do yourself a favor and stay away from that bitter mess. The Pizookie(?) is a solid dessert.   As a rule, most chains I review receive 3 stars as long as they're clean, consistent and efficient. A few years back we had our credit card information lifted and we have a strong suspicion it happened here. I can't prove it but I'm still knocking a star off because I have a feeling I'm right after retracing our steps.

Did you put me on BJ's payroll and forget to tell me?  After I told her that I wanted someone other than myself to clean it, she gets a bus boy who makes sarcastic remarks to me.  The server is just the cherry on top and ignores me and my bf while being perfectly nice to everyone else in the place. - Being with a group making them LOTS of money (ordered pitchers of drinks, apps, entrees, the works!).  We get to dessert and the pizookie comes out COLD...the ice cream wouldn't even melt.  We tell our server (after waiting 20 minutes), and her response is ""Well if you want me to send it back, you're just gonna be waiting even longer.""  Really???? It took at least another 30 minutes to settle the check.  We got the manager, who informed us that we had to wait for the server because of the way we were paying.

Tom N.,"Cypress, CA",11,35,1,2.0,12/1/2012,"I've been to this BJ's numerous times, because the location was just so convenient for a drink with friends. The more I go, the less I'm impressed. The last time I was there was maybe a week ago. We got a pitcher of the Nutty Brewnette (if you like New Castle), this is the one you should go for). I wanted some fries and some chicken fingers, which is only on the lunch menu. They were nice enough to accommodate it, but when this order came....it was like warm. Like it's been sitting on the counter. So I asked if I can have it fresh and the next order was hot on the ouside, but hard/warm in the inside (like it wasn't cooked through). I didn't want them to spit in my food so I just decided to shut up from this point on. We also ordered the blackened chicken cajun pasta. The garlic bread is not a bread. It's a huge crouton.  The visit before this was worse in the summer when we sat outside. The server completely forgot about us. We ordered Martini's, appetizers, and the main dish (it was jut two of us). The main dish came. I was in shock, because we didn't have our drinks or utensils....and then the appetizers arrived, and then our Martini's. During this time, I continued to ask for utensils until I stood up to go ask and pick it up myself. I never get upset or complain, but I had to say something. I said, I normally would like my Martini and appetizers first before my main dish. The server's excuse was that it wasn't his shift and he was forced to cover....I just kind of sat there listening to him complain thinking....so what does this have to do with me and how are you going to fix it? He didn't care and it really upset me so I had to tell the manager. The manager just said he'll give us one of the dishes on the house in the attitude like as if he's saying, ""are you happy now?""

I remember once a few years ago we ordered some steaks and because the kitchen kept over or undercooking the steak (before we ever received it -- they wouldn't bring it out incorrectly) the manager came and apologized without us ever uttering a word. He gave us all free desserts and it was awesome Aother time a few weeks ago, my fiancé and I went and although it was packed on a Friday nig, they told us we could sit on the heated patio ring away. We went and there was always a different server, runner, busboy, etc making sure our heater was working well. O top of that, they had gluten-free pizza (for this crazy diet I am on) and a tomato and mozzarella salad that were both to die for. SO GOOD! This time tonight, it was a little chilly so we opted to wait the 25 minutes for an indoor table. Wile we were waiting, the manager and a server came out with some pre-sliced pizza for everyone waiting. Wo has ever heard of such a thing?!  Amazingly great service. Also, our waiter noticed out iPad and stopped to talk to us about his favorite apps, etc.  This is no fluke here, this location is well managed.

Nicole R.,"Tujunga, CA",74,40,80,5.0,8/8/2013,"Once before me and my boyfriend had gone to the one in Valencia for a night out. We loved the deep dish pizza. So when we saw that there was one in Burbank we had to try it. So we went in and we were greeted by the kind lady at the service desk. Then our waiter promptly arrived to seat us. We got seated close to the bar which is fine because it was far from the kitchen. The sound level can be a little noisy but that is to be expected at a place such as this one. So really it was no biggie! Next here comes our waiter, he asks us if we would like to order some drinks to start. seeing as we don't drink we ordered a coke and a sprite with no ice, about 5 sec. Later here comes out waiter with the drinks. He then says he will give us some time to look over the menu. We were seated about 5-10 minutes before our waiter came over and asked us if we were ready to order which we were. We ended up getting a small pepperoni and sausage deep dish pizza and a side of chicken strips. Surprisingly the order arrived very quickly and was very hot. Also the food we got was just the right amount for us (2 people). So we began to chow down and our waiter comes over about 2 different times and asks how our food is. The food was really good. The pizza though is the topping on the cake, it is so delicious and piping hot I might add. So when we were finished it was almost like our waiter was watching us, because he came over and took our plates from us and offered dessert but we declined as we were going up the street to Yogurtland! Then before he got away we asked him if we could please have our check and he handed it to us. Our total was right around $27.00 which is not bad if you think about it. We got a small pizza 2 drinks and like 6 chicken strips...not bad I would say and it definitely filled us up. Our service and food was great and would definitely come back for more.

I explained what was wrong, and she said she was sorry. She wanted to know if she can get us anything else, we explained we were done and we didn't want anything else (after seeing that we don't have appetite for anything else) she said ok, and only took off the fettuccine Alfredo.

Joke. It's not convenient. It's not fast. And it certainly doesn't make sense. So one evening, we decided to order take out for said pizza. We placed an order online and saw they had curbside pickup. Sure, why not. When our pizza was ready, we drove to the special parking spot in front of the restaurant and called the number on the sign. The guy who answered said, ""Let me guess, an order for Dave.""  Me: ""Um no, this isn't Dave."" How about less guessing and more getting the order right. So we told him our last name and he said they'd be right out. Now in this time, another customer had parked next to us, walked into the restaurant and returned 5 minutes later, food in hand. Ok, so we chose the wrong take out method. When a server finally came out with the food, I handed her my credit card. She had to walk back to the restaurant to ring me up, then back out to give me the receipt. What, no mobile credit card reader?   Sigh, I don't know what I was expecting but it sure wasn't that.

Taking nearly close to 10 minutes to bring a beer and rushing me asking if I wanted to order food while waiting for the beer... duuuhhhh By the way... I had to get along with my 3rd beer selection... the first two weren't available... only their house IPA... weird... at least... I keep trying wishing it works better next time but I get disappointed every time.

Erin A.,"Henderson, NV",21,42,5,4.0,9/14/2013,"This was our first experience at BJ's and I have to say it lived up to all the hype. Everything, and I mean everything we had was delicious. First we ordered the Best beginnings appetizer combo, I tried everything but the avocado egg rolls. The Santa Fe Spring rolls were my favorite. The mozzarella sticks were skinnier than I am used to, coming from Wisconsin where we love our cheese. I was very impressed once I tried them though! We also got the chicken pot stickers, which would of been good if they hadn't sat under the heat lamp waiting for our other appetizer to arrive.  They were just a little crunchy on the outside.      Our waitress was really great at telling us what she recommended and was always on time with our soda refills, which is a must for us! We really hate to wait for refills :)     Next, I ordered the Blonde Fish and chips. Best fish I have had in awhile. Just squeezed a little lemon on them, and they were perfect! Even my husband, who is not a fan of fish, decided to try it, and fell in love! Said he may even order it next time!  All in all, very, very pleased with our visit.

I used to love this place as a kid, but I suppose being a kid my food pallet usually consisted of Kraft Mac n cheese, hot dogs and McNuggets.  I came on a date with my boyfriend. I ordered my favorite appetizer, the avocado egg rolls... Well apparently they come cold and with a slap of buffalo sauce on the side of the plate... On top of that, our appetizer came after our meal.  Although I talked to the manager and she was very nice and gave us a gift card to come back and get another order of my favorite apps.  Well, this time, my friend and I ordered the pazooki trio to go.  One Oreo, one peanut butter, and one chocolate chip.  The Oreo was great, but my peanut butter and chocolate chip were totally burnt....  I'm just totally disappointed....

When she was on her way to bring it she drops it all over the floor and has to go back to make another one. We waited about and hour or more till they were able to bring it out to us.

Coming here at least once a month if not more, I didn't expect such a drastic drop in quality over the past year -- maybe they're no longer using fresh ingredients or modified the original recipe.

Iska B.,"Los Angeles, CA",153,521,35,4.0,3/4/2011,"Not at all bad for a chain! Seriously! Maybe it's just my memory of the  beer sampler talking, but I genuinely enjoyed myself here! If you like beer, it is absolutely worth a try, even if you're a big food snob and you never go to chains.They brew their own beer and the samplers are very fun and quite good. There is sure to be one you'll want to try and they're generous with their sample sizes too (think cups not shot glasses). I went for the wheat beer sampler but there are many more to choose from or else just get a pitcher of your favorite brew.  I did actually eat something (ha) and that was quite nice as well. I ended up going with the Italian Market Salad which was really big and they didn't skimp on the ingredients. I loathe when a restaurant serves me a salad and it's mostly iceberg lettuce with one tomato and one olive. Not so here. This is a great and filling salad that tasted really fresh and was covered in delicious olives and fresh mozzarella cheese plus artichokes and other veggies. I found it to be very filling which was also a pleasant surprise. Despite all this food and beer there was also room left for dessert so we gave their infamous ""Pizookie"" a try. Stupid as the name is, this thing is quite tasty. It's basically a freshly baked cookie sitting in a deep dish like a pizza and topped with ice cream. It's deliciously soft (I HATE hard baked cookies) to boot. You can't go wrong with this thing. Trust me. All in all this is a satisfying chain restaurant. I'm definitely liking it a lot more than other similar counterparts (Chilis, TGIFriday's etc.) and I'd definitely come back to try more beers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=700

Again i completely understand given where i was seated and the fact that the server was so sweet and dealing with other customers that were spaced out is why i think 4 stars is fair.I HAVE to reiterate how good this girl was, i wish i could remember her name so i could ask for her next time i come in!

The place is huge, and so is the menu.  We started with the nachos and just about ate the whole thing between the two of us.  Not that it was small, but we were hungry and they were good.  Crispy chips, real cheese, and a bed of tasty chili. We also had a pizza, which our great waiter told us could be done half-half.  We got half portobello mushroom and half combination, both of which were delicious.

But this Burbank location provided the worst experience that I've ever had in terms of quality of food - I would've gotten better food digging through a trash dumpster behind any of the other restaurants in Burbank. I visited this location a couple Saturday ago with my wife, and decided to order wings, pizza, and a pizookie. The wings were delicious as always, but that's where the fun stopped. The pizza was undercooked by a significant margin and all I could taste was dough. I asked for a replacement, and the replacement took over half an hour to get, which wasn't the worst of it. This time they overcooked the pizza and made it into a hard, crunchy cookie that I could have easily thrown through a brick wall. And just when I thought the meal couldn't get any worse, out came this undercooked pizookie that was nothing more than raw cookie dough covered with ice cream.  All in all, a pathetic effort by this Burbank location.

The pints of delicious hand-crafted beers are well-priced at $5 (the blonde is my fave - so crisp, clean, and smooth!), but is an even better price during the 10pm-close happy hour, during which time they're only $4.  Our knowledgeable waiter Chris suggested we get the pitcher, which was $14.95, cheaper than four beers at even the happy hour price - smart boy! I always get the veggie deep-dish pizza, which is great, but what's even better is that the personal size is half price, about $5, during the happy hour.  Note: happy hour is only at the bar tables. I've never had a bad experience at BJ's.  In fact, when I looked around at the tables last night, everyone looked as joyous as if they were in a Dave and Buster's commercial.

Angie C.,"Mountain View, CA",43,152,1,1.0,3/6/2012,"I went to another BJ's Brewhouse in northern California this weekend that made me recall the absolutely HORRIBLE service from the Burbank BJ's. When I relayed the story to my friend, she advised me to share it on Yelp as well. 1st horrible experience: I threw a surprise party for a friend. I made the arrangements with the general manager three weeks in advance, down to the last detail including that there would be multiple checks, the party guests would need to be seated immediately even if the entire party wasn't yet there (it was a surprise, after all), and that I'd be bringing a cake/candles for the birthday girl. The morning of (Saturday in September 2010), I brought in the cake and candles and confirmed all the details with the host staff and management. Everything went smoothly for about an hour, and then things fell apart. It took more than two hours to split the checks, even though I'd offered from the start to help the servers divide them up and keep them separate. During those two hours, NO ONE came to check on us. Plenty of people wanted dessert and alcoholic drinks, but we couldn't even get anyone to bring water. I asked the server THREE TIMES for the cake. When she finally brought it out, she plunked it down in front of me (still in the box with the candles in a bag on top) and walked away. The most frustrating part was talking to management as this was happening. I was mortified that my guests were unable to leave whenever they felt like it because they didn't want to stick me with their bills. We were all stuck there for several hours with no drinks, no snacks, and no birthday celebration despite it all having been arranged in advance. When I pointed this out to management, he repeatedly apologized. Nothing more. I finally had to ASK what steps were being taken to fix the problem, and what they planned on doing to compensate us for the ruined party. After about 4 hours in the restaurant, we finally had an acceptable solution and got to leave. I was satisfied with the resolution and even came back a couple times (with non-memorable experiences) until my next horrible experience. 2nd horrible experience: This time, it was MY birthday. I was stuck at work, but wanted a to-go lunch from BJ's. I called in the order and left to pick it up. The problem with this restaurant is really the parking layout and the valet service. When I pulled into the parking lot, the valets had parked cars in all the to-go spaces. The valets directed me to a non-existent spot at the back of the lot, and I had to circle the block and re-enter the lot. Then the valets directed me to a second non-existent space. I circled the block again. The third time, I was getting pretty pissed. The valets told me to park in the handicapped spot. I told them no. They told me it was the only way I'd be able to get in at the moment, and that they did it all the time with no problems. I told them they'd be responsible for paying for any parking tickets and parked, furious.  Sure enough, a driver who actually had handicapped placards stopped me and asked why I'd parked there. Frustrated, I explained to her that the valets had told me to do it, and all I wanted to do was get my damn lunch. Wouldn't you know it, that lady called the police on the valets? Apparently she was a regular at this BJ's and was tired of the valets taking up to-go spaces and then telling to-go orderers to park in the handicapped spots (how does this become standard operating procedure?!). The valet rushed in after me, grabbed my keys, and reparked my car before the police arrived. When I mentioned what just happened to management, and the fact that this was two horrible experience related to birthdays in just a few months, I got a very nonchalant apology. I had to chase corporate customer service for MONTHS to get a response. I wound up getting a gift card for the aggravation, which I promptly used at a DIFFERENT BJ's location. I will never be returning to this one again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=720

She was quick to greet us and made sure our toddler's meal was ordered at the same time as our appetizers. The buffalo wings are a favorite! For our meals, my husband ordered the pork sliders (which he loved)  and I tried the mahi mahi. The mahi mahi was good, slightly bland, but I added a bit of chili paste that was painted on my plate for a bit of flavor. Of course you cannot leave without trying a pizookie for dessert!! Our favorite by far is the Oreo pizookie! They also offer a trio plate which is nice to share and you can pick a variety of flavors to try at once. Our server also gave each of us ""Father's Day"" pilsner glasses to take home for coming in Father's Day weekend!

lindsey a.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,28,4,2.0,2/16/2012,"I LOVE the food here but this location is the WORST. It's close to my house, so it's convenient but I'd definitely rather go to the Glendale location, and here's why: -The first time I went here, we were seated and our sever never showed up to our table. When I say never, I mean never. We waited for 30 min since it was busy, and then called over a random server to see what was up. She said she'd find our server and send them over. Didn't happen. We called her over again and she ended up taking our order out of pity, even though she was slammed. Naturally, the service sucked since we weren't her table. We never met our real server. -One time, we were sitting in the back and a COCKROACH ran across the wall. I freaked out and got up. The manager came over and said he couldn't see it but asked us if we wanted to move (Um, no, I want to stay and dine with it...?). He placed us a few seats over which wasn't really far enough. I was sketched out the rest of the meal. We could see out of the window that the dumpster was close to the booth we were sitting in, so that's definitely where it came from. -Another time, when eating the spinach artichoke dip, I bit down on a huge chunk of GLASS! We could see that the dish the artichoke dip was in was cracked and missing a big piece,  about the size of a quarter . The piece was now in my mouth. The waiter didn't seem too worried. He kind of apologized and took it away. He didn't replace it, even though we were only half done. He ended up giving us the appetizer for free but that's all. Now, I'm not one to expect free stuff from places but I felt like this matter should have been handled a bit better. For all they knew, I could have cut myself or went home and filed a lawsuit. They treated it like I complained that the dish was cold or something.  Every other time I've been here the service has been super sketch.  So why do I keep going back??! Because I am obsessed with their BBQ Chicken Salad!! It's my favorite salad ever. Their food is always good. I've never had anything bad from BJ's (except service). Their beer is amazing too. **Oh and a little tip: When you pull up, there's a valet man who wants to take your car. Valet is  optional!!  Just tell him you want to self park and drive 3 feet forward into the lot. Most everyone thinks you have to valet so they pay money to have this man pull your car up a foot and park it. Unless you're the laziest person in the world, save your $3.50 and park it yourself.

Gil G.,"Burbank, CA",0,57,,1.0,2/14/2014,"Never again. I ordered the broccoli cheddar soup. I kept finding chunks of inedible... stuff in there. I tried to eat around it (because I was hungry). Finally, there was a big enough piece so that I could examine it. It looked to be wood. I found several other chunks in there as well. Waited FOREVER for the waitress to come by so I could say something. Someone else brought my entree (and, at that point, I didn't really feel comfortable eating it), so it wasn't until the end of the (uneaten) meal when she came by. I told her about the wood in my soup. She PICKED UP THE WOOD with her bare fingers and closely examined it. Pulled it apart to look at the fibers, ran her fingers over it, etc... Again, it had been in my mouth. Then she declared it wasn't wood and that it was probably part of an artichoke that had fallen in the soup. I eat artichokes all the time, and it wasn't that (and it was all throughout the soup), but whatever. I waited her for her apologize and offer $$ off the bill or something. Nope. No apology. She didn't even take the price of the soup off. I was furious but didn't want to ruin my date by bitching about it, so we just paid & left. Never ever again. The next week, I went to a similar, but different restaurant in Burbank. My husband's spoon had a weird sharp ridge on it, so he mentioned it to the waiter (I know it sounds like we go to restaurants and bitch a lot... but we really don't!). The waiter brought him another spoon. Later, the manager came over and was SUPER nice! Very apologetic (even though we assured him it wasn't a huge deal), brought us free dessert, and then took 50% off our check! All without us asking!

I treated my colleague to lunch since the co. told her that her temp position wouldn't be there at the end of the month. Sad. So she ordered a pint of Piranha and a lunch special grilled chicken pasta with a side salad. I got the fish and chips (with a choice of fries or wedges) and an Arnold Palmer (why is the drink named after a golf pro?) Looking at my colleague's pasta it looked a little unloved. I didn't try it as my fish and chips arrived. The cod came in nugget-sized pieces, but one of them was grey instead of white like cod is meant to be. And the greyness had a watery consistency. Probably a bad bit of frozen fish. It happens. But then comes the condiment incident.  Sarson's malt vinegar was a ""wow"" for me. But only at BJ's is the sprinkler cap missing (mine at home has a sprinker.) So, I go and sprinkle, but it turns into a pour, pour, pour malt vinegar all over the potato wedges which proceed to soak it all up :( Bollocks!

The good was great as always, but I'm reviewing more for the customer service. Our waiter's name was Charlie, and he was the best waiter I've had in a very long time at BJ's. Charlie was very courteous, accommodating, and friendly! Somebody needs to make this guy employee of the month or something--seriously. I hadn't been to the Burbank BJ's in a very long time due to a past negative experience, but I'm so glad we went in today. The only thing I thought was kinda weird was the mandatory valet parking--I don't like leaving my keys with anybody. That's just me.

Secondly the usual quick lunchtime service was unusually slow.  For awhile we waited for the server to show up to take our order and then the fun begins: waiting over 20 minutes for food to arrive.  I ordered the quite bland Pesto and Chicken thin crusted pizza which was served on the cold side.  I had the server reheat it which took another 10 minutes.  If I were to wait 20+ minutes for food, it should come to the table piping hot.

My server was Rebecca and she was very nice.  I ordered a classic baked potato, added cheese and bacon for about an extra $2. The potato came out and it was not even warm, the cheese was not melted as it usually is, they forgot to bring butter, and they forgot green onions. They made me another one, which I ate, but it was also not warm and they still forgot the green onions. Oh and they were both stale. Considering they brought them both out within like 2 minutes of ordering them, I'm guessing they were old. I'm usually excited when my food comes out fast, but that was not the case this time.  Then I got an Oreo pizookie, which at any other BJs is the best dessert ever. Not here. It was extremely doughy. So undercooked. Oh, and, they were not generous with the ice cream. I didn't eat it.

Fortunately, a waiter who normally was not assigned our table saw us waiting and took care of us. So the service was not terrible, but we should not have had to wait as long as we did.

If they had told us 30 minutes for a table we would have gone elsewhere since we were on somewhat of a time schedule. But having invested over 20 minutes it was too late for us to move to a different restaurant. Our server was also not so great. Since we waited 45 minutes we had already decided on our order so as soon as the server came we were ready to order. I told her so and she gave us this look like ""wtf I only wanted drink orders from you."" She took drinks and food orders from us and then left without a word. No ""thank you,"" no smile, nothing. She just turned around and left and I was still holding our menus for her to take. Way to ignore me. She never did take those menus, they sat at the table until we left. She wasn't the most prompt server either. Even if she was insanely busy and having the worst night of her life, I would have been happy with at least a smile. Terrible service.

Sara R.,"Dallas, TX",108,276,,4.0,6/19/2010,"You only come to BJ's for Happy Hour.   If you don't, then no wonder you're not happy. Happy Hour yields 50% off of their mini pizzas (so it ends up being about $5), $2 off of the other apps, and $1 off of their draft beers - and I think the wine, too.  Not the best deal, beer-wise, but the deal on the food before 7pm on weekdays, makes up for it. Happy Hour is only reedemable if you sit at the bar, or the tables in the middle section of the bar area.  NOT the booths surrounding the bar.  Lame.   You get a good dose of sports, sporting updates, and more sports with the many TVs along the perimeter.   The food.  It's good.  Especially their pulled pork sliders.  Some of the best pulled pork I've had!  I got the angus sliders last night, and although they're good, the meat is not thick enough to make me vouch for them.   The mini pizzas are great.  Very fluffy crust..  loads of cheese, good amount of meat, and limited veggies.  Well, if you get the veggie one, I'm sure it would alter that ratio.  I got the Southwestern one, and it was just ok.  I wouldn't get it again.  I've had the buffalo chicken pizza, and that's royal.  I've also had the Great White (a long time ago), but remember it as being pretty freakin good.  I mean, alfredo sauce?  That has no option to be bad. They don't have your typical beers..  draft or bottle..  i.e. Miller/Lite, Bud/Lite, Heineken, etc.  Alas, it's a brewery.  I haven't had their beer in awhile, but I believe it was good.  It was the blonde beer (the lightest one they have).

It was a bustling Thursday night and the place was crowded with high school students and birthday parties.  The wait staff was clearly busy, so I did not get my side salad until the entree arrived, and they forgot to include pineapple salsa with my salmon. It wasn't a big deal -- I'm not one to be fussy, especially with my favorite restaurant.  However, they more than made up for their mistakes without me even having to ask!  I received many apologies from both our waiter and the manager... then they completely took my entree off the bill (it's a $15 dish) and gave us a free pizooki! This is why I come back again & again.  Not only is the food hot, fresh & delicious each time, but the staff is friendly, considerate, and more than happy to make your experience enjoyable.  I moved here from the Midwest last year, and it's appalling how horrible the customer service is!  This is one chain that I can count on.  I don't understand why it only averages 3.5 stars and I'm shocked that reviewers are complaining about the prices.  It's about the same as The Cheesecake Factory, El Torito, or pretty much anywhere else in Los Angeles.

Michelle R.,"Burbank, CA",1,2,,1.0,6/16/2015,"I went to BJ's in Burbank with a friend. The service was awful our waiter seemed like he was stoned out of his mind. When it came to paying the bill I want to use my points that I have from catering all of my business meetings, which totaled 592. They told me I had no points and I have never used them. They went on to say they could nothing about the points but would give us half off of the bill. Well I checked my bank account and they charged the full bill, but the charged slip I signed was for half the bill. So not only did they lie about it they had me sign charge receipt with a different amount then what they charged. Now all this was done by the manager because as I said the waiter was too stoned to know what was going on. So this is one of two things or maybe both; fraud, or they have no idea what they are doing, or both. I will never eat there again and I definitely will never use them for our meetings.

I don't even know where to start.  To start off, they were out of Pepsi, and almost every appetizer I wanted. That wasn't so bad. Then my food came out and I asked for ranch because the container that should've had ranch was missing the ranch. That was ok too. So I asked for plates. That took 25 minutes to come out. So by the time the plates were out I told my waiter that my food was cold and he said well ""these don't usually come out with plates"" this guy loved to talk back. On top of that he pointed out that he spilled the ranch on him and that's why he didn't bring that out.  So I asked for the manager..

Paul D.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,38,11,4.0,3/27/2010,"It's my fourth time eating at this BJs so here goes.  First, they make you wait in their waiting area for 10-15 minutes, so that once they sit you down, you wait another 10-15 minutes for mediocre service and your food...  So once they finally get to you, they start you off with drinks and appetizers. I've never had their beer but I have heard that it is good... I'll have to try it for myself some day... Anyway, their soft drinks are $2.95... I always get the Strawberry Lemonade which is pretty darn good. For appetizers, if calamari is available I always order it and wudduya know? They have it for $8.95 and it is pretty awesome. It has the right amount of crispiness so that you can enjoy the taste, not like other places where it's not crispy enough or just too crispy. It comes with two lemons, marinara dip, and ranch dip.  For the main course I get the Scampi Pasta, because I love shrimp,  but here's the kicker, instead of the Angel Hair and Roma tomatoes that it originally comes with, I ask for Fettuccine and Sun Dried Tomatoes!!! This costs $14.95.  You seriously gotta try it!!! You most definitely won't regret it!!! : ) Finally for dessert, their signature Pizookie for $5... something... sorry I can't remember off the top of my head but it's usually just under $6. Anyway, I always get the White Chocolate Macadamia with Vanilla Ice-Cream. Haven't had any other one but this one has never let me down. If you do end up eating at BJs, don't leave without having a Pizookie!!!  So aside from the wait and mediocre service, the food is what gave them a four. The fact that they actually do the changes I request and the quality of the taste is good.

Their happy hour is pretty good, not great, but good. The appetizers during this period are a really good deal. The mini pizzas are all pretty good, share 3 of 'em with friends. The drink menu is interesting. BJs makes their own beer, but not on the premises of course. That operation is done elsewhere. The beer vats are just for show apparently. I like the seasonal trappist style ale they make (winter time I guess). The porter is okay and the rest of their beers are average. During happy hour the beer prices are good. Even better is getting a drink though that would cost you $9 or $10 normally and paying like $4 or $5 for it. They make a good Long Island Ice Tea here too, in other words, they don't leave out the tequila like most people do. Can't see myself coming to a BJs a lot, and parking sucks at this place during the day, the staff is alright but not great.

It was saturday night and the wait was 30-45 min for 2 people, we do not have thaT much time because i have a 5 month old baby to get back to asap so we took a pager and started looking for seats at the bar. My bf sees 2 people leaving and we scored 2 seats in the bar area which were perfect, high table for 2 directly in front of the televisions. We were approached immediately and had our table wiped down. we started off with 2 jeremiah reds my favorite beer there, i noticed they changed their uniforms because i used to work in the bj's at glendale. the girl was very happy to tell us why and when they made this change. She was very friendly and understanding to all of our needs. We ordered the best beginnings as our appetizer and doubled the spinach dip. The only annoying part was that there was a couple sitting next ot us on a date and the girl just kept talking louder and louder, I think she was obviously getting sloppy drunk and the guy was so nervous he kept shaking his foot and that drives me crazy. i turned side ways to face my boyfriend and enjoy his company instead of getting mad. He ordered a clam chowder which was super good, and the food runner brought a second one, i told him we already had one and he said ""now you have another"" woo hoo! Finally we ended with a bbq chicken pizza (sooo good). Nothing could have  made our night better. Until i decided that i just had to take a couple of glasses home to drink beer later. I asked the girl instead of just stealing them if she could charge me for 2 glasses or if i could have them. I was shocked when she said i could take them and even brought me 2 fresh clean glasses from the back. WOW!! We really had a great fun time, and really enjoyed the service, we never had to look for our server to get anything, she was always there. Eventually she had to go home and introduced the next cocktail girl to us and we decided to close the tab out with her so that we could show her our appreciation with a nice tip.

Marion S.,"North Hollywood, CA",183,102,39,3.0,1/4/2009,"""It's not a bad place to go but there are just better out there. I know I say that in most of my reviews but it holds true at BJs. It's a cool place to go with some friends and have a few drinks. That's the one great thing about this place, you get some friends and a few drinks and you can never have a bad time. Let's start with the food shall we. I can't speak poorly of the food nor can I speak highly of it either. Certain things are better than others however. I'd stay away from their burgers, I've never been a fan of it. Their sandwiches though, depending on what you get can be good. I remember getting the Turkey California Club once and it left me full and satisfied. The Jambalaya is good and really spicy. I once had the pasta and it was just meh. The meatloaf is worth getting if you're hungry and don't want to chew. However the two best things to get here are their HUGE baked potatoes or their pizza. The potato can be kind of a crap shoot. Sometimes it's cooked perfectly and other times not so much. If you're hungry and are on a high carb diet or just want to die of gluttony, I say get the baked potato. It's prepared a few different ways. I'm a fan of the Broccoli and Cheese with Alfredo sauce. So many calories yet so much goodness. Their pizzas are some of the best I've had. I'm not a fan of deep dish pizzas but I am when I'm here. Usually deep dish pizzas can be chewy but that isn't the case here. Sure you may need to eat your pizza with a knife and fork, which I've been informed makes you less of a man. (Sidebar: Thin crust pizza FTW!) Best way to have a meal here is to wash it down with something alcoholic. As it says in it's name, BJ's is a brewery so they make their own beers here and only serve their own beers (with the exception of a Chimay I believe). Their beers are OK, but I'm only a fan of their lighter beers. The blond and hef are probably the best. Once you're piss drunk and full, you're gonna wanna get the pizookie or the brownie. Both are just cookies (or a brownie) warm from the oven and they pile on a few scoops of ice cream. There's nothing really special about it but it's just so good. All in all, it's a great place to go but it's just average.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=780

We started out with a garden salad, which was nothing special, the tomatoes were a little mushy, but not too bad. I got the parmesan crusted chicken which was delicious, its drizzled with a cream sauce that I had to request for more of (because without it, the chicken was dry). The broccoli and mash potatoes were average. The lady got the jambalaya, which was filled with shrimp and chicken sausage. It had a nice taste and spice to it.  We didnt try the beer, but it looked like a good selection. The prices seemed right, and my only complaint was the service didnt seem very friendly, and it was loud.

The in-house brews are a treat, and the non-alcoholic homemade drinks (like root beer, cream soda, and orange cream soda) are a nice plus if you are with a group that is not in for imbibing (as was the group I was with). But when we arrived with our party of five adults and two kids, they placed us in a booth that was really meant for 5 max. We had to ask them to move us, which they promptly did, to a table in the bar area. But, really, who puts 7 people in a booth that small, especially on a very hot day and when tables in the bar are plentiful? Service was great, orders taken fairly promptly, and refills kept a-comin'. There was a situation where two of the men in our group ordered bowls of clam chowder and got bread bowls instead, a minor mix-up. But towards the end of the meal our server went AWOL for awhile. This is less felt when you are with a big group and everyone is talking, but I noticed it. It was the very moment that my 6-year old wanted water to finish up his meal, and it took awhile from that point for our waiter to stop by so that we could ask for it.

Elizabeth B.,"Baltimore, MD",9,20,,4.0,9/29/2009,"So... yeah. I met up with some friends down in Burbank last Friday. Being totally unfamiliar with the area (I live on the East Coast, my fam is in Ventura), I let them do the choosing of the place to eat, and BJs was chosen. Why? Well, mostly because we're all a bunch of lushes and they do their own beer. I did not mention that I'd eaten at the BJs in Oxnard the night before. That'll be our wee secret, okie doke? I ordered hefeweizen tonight. Yum. A vast improvement over the way-too-weirdly-tart-but-sweet cider of the night before. Really, any place that does their own beer is going to get three stars to start from me. As long as they're, yanno, good at it.

Our waitress was tits, y'all. She dealt with some odd requests and other eccentricities with aplomb and good grace.

Ellie L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,35,14,2.0,12/26/2012,"BJ's is a great restaurant and honestly, who can resist those pazookies?! However, after my experience there last week, I won't be going to this BJ's again.  BJ's is always ridiculously busy, and this one charges for valet parking. Limited self-parking, but the whole parking lot is always full. I went here and ordered the California burger medium well (which is a little pink in the center) - avocado, chipotle mayo, creamy ranch - sounds great! I added bacon  However, I made it clear to my server that I wanted ONLY BACON, NO CHEESE. So you can imagine my disappointment when out comes my burger and I'm staring straight at a cheeseburger.  It took extremely long to get our server to come over, and I told him, ""I don't think this is my burger."" he stares at it and goes, ""no it's not"" and took it back with the promise to get me the right burger.  A couple minutes later, the manager heard what happened and came over to apologize. As the manager is apologizing, our server came out with my (correct) burger.  however, now my steak fries had changed to the string fries. I politely noted this and the server reached to take my burger back again.  The manager stopped him and told him to leave my burger and just bring me a side of the correct fries.   I was unimpressed with the service or how long it took to get my order delivered correctly.  It was hard to get a hold of our server the rest of the night and it took about 10 minutes for him to come pick up our check.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=820

kimberly a.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,,4.0,11/22/2010,"The food is great especially the spinach dip, parmesan crusted chicken and pizookies. Don't expect the best service, but that's to be expected at a chain restaurant.  One problem: Do not get take out at this location! They completely rip you off when you get take out here.  Sometimes when we get home and finally see our food, it is laughable. The veggies I got one time with my meal were 4 carrots. At times, it can be almost half the food.  It's kind of funny because they think they have this big secret that you won't figure out....I eat at the restaurant so I know how much a serving size is there vs when you get take out, and the difference is ridiculous.  I realize they are probably trying to save money, but they are losing my money because now I will only eat in the restaurant. Unfortunately, I don't really have time to do that so I just get food somewhere else.    Hopefully they will read this and it will change. I will try again in a few months to see if it's gotten better, but until then I'm only eating at the restaurant.

Kevin F.,"Los Angeles, CA",196,172,4,4.0,10/13/2007,"I've been to a few different BJs locations, but I have to say this one is my favorite.  The food is pretty much the same, but the atmosphere is much better than the others I've been to.  It is a big place, and generally busy in the evening.  Even though it is crowded, since it is a big place the wait usually isn't very long.  They have a bar area with open seating as well, so if there is an empty table there you can grab it.   The food here has always been good.  I've had the pizza, french dip, BBQ beef, meatloaf and probably a few other things I can't remember at the moment.  The pizza is thick crust, which I'm a big fan of.  The buffalo chicken pizza is my favorite.  Nice and spicy and served with a side of ranch dressing.  They have a good selection of appetizers (I've had the nachos, wings and chicken fingers, all good) and desserts.  Their specialty dessert is the pizookie.  Mmmmm...pizookie...a big warm cookie with ice cream on top.   They also serve a variety of microbrew and specialty beers.  They have televisions showing sports throughout the restaurant so you can follow the games while you eat and/or drink (although you can't hear them because they're usually playing music).   My only complaint with this BJs is the parking.  You either have to valet park, which I'm against, or you have to drive up a 45 degree incline and fight for one of the limited spaces on top of the parking structure.   One last note for the fellas, for some reason there are usually a lot of attractive women at this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=820

Anyway we ordered the Avocado Egg Rolls that just melt in your mouth.  Yum.  But our waiter sent some PMS-ing chick to tease us with them.  She literally waved them in our drooling faces and said, ""Um, lemme check..."" and walked away.  Evil wench.  Luckily she came back and my friend said ""Are you back to tease us again?"" in an obvious joking manner.  She responded again PMS-y ""Well I had to check otherwise I'd get in trouble"".  A few minutes later our order starts to come out.  Again our waiter sends another stick-up-her-ass assistant who mumbles what she has and none of us understand so we ask ""What was that?"".  She:  SIGHS (!!!) and says ""BBQ Chicken Pizza and Calzone"".  Oh.  BBQ Chicken right here.  Sheesh.  And my BBQ Chicken Pizza was just okay.  I prefer CPK's.   Also, Maria had what she called ""Berry Beer"" and it tasted...yucky.   We all get our food and luckily having great conversation and having fun complaining about our shitty service.  But when my friends try to order another round of their drinks (Cadillac Margs, yummy!, and the above mentioned Poison Apple) it took FOREVER.  And he got the Poison Apple wrong.   After what seemed like an hour after we asked for our check, he apologized for the poor service and complained that there was supposed to be 3 servers out on the patio but 2 had called out sick and he was left alone.  Sorry, not our problem.  They shouldn't have sat so many tables outside then!   But yay $2.25 valet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=820

It was because of these frequent visits that I unabashedly gained 10lbs solely from the baked potatoes and their vast drinks menu. It came to a point where I found myself turning into potato, the carb intake in this place is criminal enough to make Richard Simmons commit murder.  Since then, I've gained a new boyfriend and a better handle on my self control and limit my visits here to once every month or couple of months, depending on the Lakers game schedule. I've also gain a high tolerance of beer and everything carb related. I usually stick to my fail proof dishes -- the bbq/ranch chicken salad, the grilled burger melt, the crispy chicken, cuban burger, the blackened chicken potato, the great white pizza, and the bbq chicken pizza. Best beer yet is the Jeremiah Red mixed with Berry Cider. Jeremiah Red is also great by itself, as is the berry cider. As someone so kindly pointed out, pizzas are half off during Happy Hour 3-7pm. Appetizers are $2 off and I think it's $2 off the beer too(I'll have to check that).  All so good.

Chris O.,"Glendale, CA",2,27,,2.0,7/30/2010,"BJs isn't the kind of place you want to eat it every day. The prices are a bit high for the quality of food that you get. The service is so-so. You'll get your food, but you might have to wait awhile. And if you ask for extra tomatoes on your pizza, you might not get as many as you hoped for, but it'll still taste good.  That said, I'd still go to BJs every once in a while if someone else in my party suggested it. I'd be game, 'cause you can't ask for everything.  EXCEPT that the last time I tried to go there for lunch with a friend, the valet guy wouldn't let me park my car on my own. This is a deal breaker. I've been to this BJs several times. The valet guys are usually totally cool. I don't know if BJs or the valet company changed their policy, or maybe I just got a dumb guy, but he said I absolutely had to valet park. So we left and ate somewhere else.

Luckily, I worked in this area so BJ's was a great place when work was busy during the day and I didn't have time to drive over and pick up food. BJ's has this great thing where they print your order on labels and then attach said labels to the box so you always know what's what.

He returned with our appetizer and dinner at the same time. Okay, I'll let that pass. He didn't come back to our table until my girlfriend was pushing the somewhat warm lettuce of her salad around her plate with her fork out of frustration that we'd not been offered a pizookie yet. The Waiter kind-of threw down the check in the little folio and walked away without offering us dessert. Wow...

Marcus S.,"Altadena, CA",45,49,,3.0,7/4/2006,"Party Pizookie. Thats really all that you need to know. And if you don't know what that means, well then let me educate you. Imagine a cookie so large that if sent into space it would disturb the tide and currents of our oceans. SO large that if placed in front of the sun, it rays would be blocked and would send our world into ice and darkness. SO EFFING LARGE, that if Rosie o' Donnell ate out the center she could use it as a hula hoop. Well i might be exagerating but a pizookie is a rather large cookie (freshly baked mind you) served with a generous helping of ice cream and more than enough sugar to keep you bouncing off the walls through all hours of the night. Other than that though? The food selection is only meh. Their pizza is great deep dish style, but very small, and very expensive. On the whole to me it dosen't seem like the price matches up to the food they serve. It's really one of those situations where you might end up paying like 9 bucks or something for spaghetti or 8 for a slice of pizza.  While it should be noted that their food does taste really good (and the pizookie is quite possibly the 8th wonder of the world) the price is effing steep.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=820

The waitstaff is very friendly and the hostesses are cute too =).

We had already partook of some Pink's hot dogs, so we were feeling like we needed to eat something light. My friend ordered the Santa Fe Salad. She thought the portions of her chicken were appropriate and really loved the thick avocado slices. I ordered the BBQ chopped salad. It was very tasty. Any salad with black beans and I'm there. The lettuce was finely chopped. It reminded me of how California Pizza Kitchen chops their salads. You get plenty of lettuce in addition to the toppings. Nicole G. is correct in saying that the salads are huge.  Our server was attentive and did a great job as the amount of people increased inside the restaurant.

Rhonda C.,"Sylmar, CA",51,13,,2.0,2/11/2013,"I had eaten at BJ's once before - We were seated in an alcove at a large round table next to a door to the patio dining area.  It was cold out (it was April) and the constantly opening door made it cold inside.  It was not diners who were coming in and out, but employees - management could not be bothered to seat us elsewhere even though we asked.  There was also an unpleasant smell.  I ordered the Tuscany Pasta with grilled chicken that evening - what came was burnt chicken on a bed of pale angel hair pasta.  There were pale tomatoes, which tasted acidy.  To give credit, the waitress brought parma cheese, garlic salt, etc, immediately and exchanged the burnt chix for a fresh piece, so I figured it was a one time thing.   Last night we had a family dinner, and ended up at BJ's.  We ordered our drinks and an appetizer from one waitress who handed us off to another due to required breaks.  She seemed to have it together and was very attentive and nice - we did not see her for the rest of the evening - we were there for 2 1/2 more hours.  The second waitress seemed to be lack luster and apathetic - took our order and went along her way.  It took almost 45 min for a third server to bring our soups (4 ordered soup - 3 soups arrived).  He brusquely served us and when asked about the 4th soup, he said ""let me get your server"" and walked away. . .it was about 15 minutes before our server showed up and by that time the main course came out.  When I asked about my soup she stared blankly and asked what kind of soup was it. . .she was not one of the two waitress serving the entree's and was just standing there.  One of the other servers was bubbly and apologized and explained the kitchen ran out and was making more!!!  But by that time I didn't want it - why would I?  my main entree was there!!!  My entree was Tuscan angel haired pasta and remembering what happened the last time, I ordered it with grilled salmon.  It was burnt to a crisp!!!!  I immediately called it to the servers attention and she again stood there.  The thin blond bubbly one whisked it away immediately and said it would be fixed.  I was hungry and annoyed!!!  The manager came over and kept asking if I wanted the soup.  Of course not - I just want my food already!!!  but he insisted I wanted the soup, so I would have soup!!!  The main entree came back out within 5 min, salmon was perfect this time, but pasta was missing peppers and pine nuts. . .I decided enough was enough and asked Apathetic waitress for garlic - she left and came back to ask whether whole or powder. . .Bubbly girl came back and gave me both.  Manager came again to say he was sorry, and offered a couple of deserts for free.  Great - my choices were pizookies with ice cream and a berry crumble with ice cream.  Apathetic waitress came back to take our dessert order - my children asked her regarding anything sugar free for desserts - She said ""ice cream"".  When my kids said, no - she is diabetic, anything else - Apathetic girl turned and walked away.  Then turned around, said ""i'll ask the manager"" and walked away.  Bubbly blond girl served us the one dessert we did order.  We never saw the manager again and when I tried to get Apathetic servers attention, she was in the middle of a group of servers, wildly waving her hands, while the other servers ackwardly glanced in our direction.  Finally she brought the bill and never came back for it.   I don't think we will ever visit again. . .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=840

Ella B.,"Los Olivos, CA",26,628,12,1.0,7/20/2008,"We met up with my friend after going through the IKEA maze.  We were starving and pizza seemed like a good idea.  We were seated quickly and that was about all the quickness for the night.   Elizabeth A. was our server.  We were a group of 3 seated next to a group of 33!  ok, maybe not 33, but something to the tune of 10 adults and 5 kids.  maybe our server was a little overwhelmed and maybe she was new, but really, that's irrelevant b/c that's not my problem, it's hers.  just like when i am having a crappy day, it's my problem, not my clients.  see, i'm fair! anyway, so *finally* our waters were brought out... by another server mind you.   *finally* Elizabeth A. decides to take our order.  We ordered beers first.    i was nearly done with my beer when Elizabeth A. *finally* decides that she's at work after all and takes our food orders.  We ordered, one spinach artichoke pizza, one chicken dish and shrimp tacos.   the food came out promptly and each of them were decent.  the pizza wasn't half bad, and if I were judging them solely on food, i would go 4 stars.  The beers were pretty decent too.  4 stars for beer.  We also order the apple cobbler thingy for dessert and it was ok.  not bad, but not as fantastic as the description in the menu would have you  believe.   the service was spotty throughout the whole night and at one point it was like Lizzie realised that she was sucking ass so she was trying to be our friend.  yeah, thanks but no thanks, you're my server and all i really expect you to do is bring my food and bring it with manners, not this ""yah""  ""what's up?"" bullsh*t.  m'kay?  you don't say ""what's up?"" to a female customer that already doesn't like you, it doesn't work that i may find you cute.  try it with the guys, it may work better, in fact i'm sure it will work better.   I realise that i must be sounding like a stuck up little skank and I very well may be, but this is so cal, i'm far from being mean, yet.  anyway, the FINAL straw were two things (yeah, really the final two, b/c up till this point i was going to tip her).  1) she brought the bill and just dropped it off, no words, like ""whenever you're ready"", ""take your time""  or even: ""can i get you anything else?""  NO, NONE, ZIPPO, NADA.  really.  2) we wanted to split the cards and she grabbed the check and didn't ask us how we wanted to split it.  She grabbed it so fast WHILE I was still having dessert so i didn't have a chance to stop her.  and it may just be me, but i generally don't find it necessary nor desirable to chase down my server in order to pay my bill! so, she split it in 1/2 which was NOT THE WAY I WANTED IT DONE ELIZABETH A.  I wanted $20 on one and the rest on the other, capiche?  next time, ASK when you SEE two ccards in the holder.  it won't hurt to ask, really it's better to ask than to assume things. anyway, so when the bill came, i DIDN'T tip her b/c most of the night she didn't serve us.  yea, and i'm the customer that wrote you a nice little note so if you don't like it, try harder next time.  Bottom line: 4 stars for the beer & food. 3 stars for ambiance. 0 stars for service this review is based on service - if ya couldn't tell.... if you want deep dish pizza, i suggest take out....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=800

The hostesses were great.  Friendly and helpful in picking a table with easy access for one person in our party who has some difficulty getting around.   Waiter came to our table immediately, and although he talked a mile a minute and mumbled which made him hard to understand, he was very friendly.  Drinks were fine.  Appetizer (Chicken Lettuce Wraps) was just okay. Waiter changed as our original waiter went home...but the new waiter was very nice and very personable.  He answered tons of questions. We ordered our food for the five of us.....and then we waited....and waited....and waited. We finally asked about our soup and salads that came with our order after about 25 minutes.  The waiter made an excuse about waiting for the soup, and then showed up about 5 minutes later with our soup/salad.  Cesar salad was blah.  Not much flavor in the dressing.   Our food came about 20 minutes after that.  Yes, we waited over 45 minutes for our food. Buffalo burger was cold.  Moroccan Salmon was cold.  Santa Fe Rolls were cold.  Pizza was cold.  Quesadilla was cold.  The only thing served to us that was hot were the beans that came with the quesadilla! One item was ordered with no avocado, but came with avocado.  The pizza which was supposed to have mushrooms, didn't even have the mushrooms.   Our meal was pathetic.  We started to send the food back, but the waiter didn't seem confident that we would get it back any time soon.  So, most of us ate the cold food.   Except for the one in our group who hadn't wanted to go there at all....he just sat and shook his head saying ""Told you so!"" and wouldn't even touch his pizza.    He couldn't get out of that place fast enough.  Skip the pazookie!  Not worth it! The waiter did send the manager to our table and after expressing our disappointment, she did comp the entire meal.  The ENTIRE meal.  We certainly didn't expect that! I do give her credit for accepting responsibility for the lousy meal, and that's why I gave two stars instead of one.  But we won't be going back.  Next time, we listen to the kid who likes everything, but hates BJ's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=800

I actually think that those places have no competition or anything alike which would also be a chain...Gordon Birch maybe but those are so rare. Their menu is huge and offers anything form wraps to steaks to soups to pastas name it they have it. Anyone in your group will probably be able to find something to the taste on the menu. Needless to mention they are famous for their pizzas and beers. They brew their own beers which are pretty good and have Belgian beer menu where you can find some pretty weird beers form all over the place ( please try the lambics yum!). As for pizza, it is supposed to be ""Chicago style"" and is pretty damn good , although as I have heard from people who actually lived in Chicago is nothing like pizzas over there. The only downfall I can mention about the place is the fact that their dessert menu is non existent. Sorry, Pizzuky just doesn't cut it for me.

It took a while but both were good, not great, and reasonably priced.  I then went into the women's bathroom and, to my disgust, saw a fairly large roach. I thought I better step on it to preserve the evidence cuz I was blown away that a major chain restaurant would have bugs crawling around in plain site. (sorry animal lovers!) I then went to tell the manager of my find. He told me he was sorry but since roaches only go where there is food it must have been a 'water bug'. I mean really- who the fuck cares?-it was a big bug strolling around in your restaurant! He then proceeded to tell me he would take care of it and thanked me for telling him about it. That's it. WTF? Why not offer me 10% off or a free pizookie for the trauma I went thru? I thought that was crummy customer service and I couldn't believe he didn't offer me anything for my bad experience. I liked the food and I liked the service but don't tell me it's ok to have a bug in your restaurant just cuz it's a water bug!?!

I try to get different dishes everytime I go anywhere and tonight I was in the mood for salmon and tried the Salmon plate (blackened, of course) and it was quite tasty. The peppered seasoning was not so overwhelming like other places and the steamed veggies were the right consistency.

Food was 2-3 stars, we tried the lettuce wraps and a mini pizza (the works) for about $8.50 each.  Nothing to write home about, but I'll definitely be back to try more.  The pizookie sounds awesome, getting that next time for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-burbank?start=880

I started off by ordering the fried calamari an when they brought it over it looked appetizing, but it was disappointing. It tasted like they just dredged the pieces in flour and fried them in some funky old oil. Now where I work we season the flour for the calamari. Then I ordered the balsamic grilled chicken thing and when I got it again same thing, looked appetizing smelled good , but no flavor. Once I got through that I dared to go for the brownie, and let me tell you, it HAD flavor!!!! Yaaaaay I thought to myself, but as I kept going for more I found out that I was in for some archeological findings as I had to chisel away at the edges to get the caked on parts of the brownie. All in all this place was to much money for what they give you. The food was bland and I noticed that most of their desserts are served in the same five inch cake pans so I have a feeling they don't even make the batter for the brownie, but order it pre-made so they just pour it into the pan and microwave that B.
