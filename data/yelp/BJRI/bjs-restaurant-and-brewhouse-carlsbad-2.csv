Krysten S.,"Oceanside, San Diego, CA",279,67,78,4.0,1/7/2018,"Came here for an easy dinner/get together with a few friends on NYE before we hit the bars. It was pretty busy with young people who probably had the same idea. The server was really nice and attentive but you could tell he was a little stressed out with how busy the place was.  Drinks were okay, not super strong but not weak, it is a family friendly place after. I tried a Paloma which was refreshing just super sweet. Food wise, everything came out relatively hot and altogether. We had the Parmesan chicken with lemon thyme sauce, chicken fettuccine, salmon, spinach artichoke dip, sriracha Brussel sprouts, queso and fries. Everything was pretty good, just kind of normal food, nothing special you know? The chicken was crispy but needed more sauce, the pasta was pasta, it's hard to mess up. The salmon was very good with the asparagus and the apps were just kind of meh. It's the same experience you'd get at any chain place. However, the atmosphere, the friends and the service coupled with easily good food made this 4 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2
Carmik T.,"Gilbert, AZ",70,384,751,4.0,12/30/2017,"Service was very polite & professional. I had the lunch special "" endless soup & salad"" $9.95. I only had one serving of soup/ salad so a fair price. My son had the brisket burger, huge and couldn't finish it. Very tasty.. My husband had the club sandwich and was a delicious classic. We had ordered the chicken wings as an appetizer ( bone in Traditional) they brought out the boneless and presented them on the table. We told the server who brought them, they should have been traditional ( bone in). She proceeded to take the plate off the table and correct the problem. Our server came out and said it was her mistake, that she hit the wrong key. It was some time before we would get the order right, so she asked us if we wanted the boneless back out to munch on. ""Of course"". My son is a server and stated that technically once the plate hits the table, it should be served / comp'ed. I applauded them for ""making it right"". We travel often and always enjoy eating at this chain, as they always have something to offer everyone. Great menu at an affordable price & portion wise you get what you pay for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2
Cindy K.,"San Marcos, CA",6,42,20,1.0,12/3/2017,"Beyond disappointment. Great waiter, awful food.  Jambalaya was a complete false advertising. I wish I had taken a picture of how white it was as it was rice and boule barely shrimp with a whole can of dry seasoning shaken all over. I was so offended they were trying to pass it off as Jambalaya. It looked nothing like the picture on their menu.  Ordered a pizza and raw.  The Chicken Bacon Ranch Piadia - looked nothing like the picture again. The wrap was toasted hard so the filling was a disaster. Not once did the picture or description mention toasting.

Lili T.,"San Diego, CA",347,201,347,4.0,9/5/2017,"Came here for lunch yesterday and we barely beat the rush! It was so great coming in around 1pm during the holiday weekend and getting seated immediately.  I've been here a few times before (in other locations), but this was my family's first time here. We were greeted with a very friendly waiter and he quickly got us our drinks. For entrees we got a grilled chicken sandwich, quinoa power bowl with shrimp, Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos, and the Chicken Pesto thin crust tavern pizza. Everything came out relatively quickly and everyone enjoyed their meal! The grilled chicken sandwich had an egg overtop, the fries it came with were AMAZING, the quinoa power bowl had plenty of shrimp, the pita tacos were delicious and had a great yogurt sauce to go along with it, and the tavern pizza was thin, crispy, and flavorful.  We had a great experience and will likely come back to this establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2

Johnny C.,"Central West End, Saint Louis, MO",0,26,40,5.0,12/31/2017,This a must go when visiting Carlsbad outside San Diego. Their BBQ IS TASTY!

Monica T.,"Las Vegas, NV",52,135,231,1.0,7/24/2017,"I was very disappointed at my visit here. I figured there was no way BJ's, a huge and reputable food chain could ever have such a low rating; that was until my visit last night.  We arrived and we're seating right away. I should have read the signs the universe gave me when we arrived. The hostess with an overloaded amount of make up took our names. This was followed by another young lady who seated us. I said we had 5 in our party, and we were seated at a table for 4. We told the hostess she was missing a chair, so she sent us back to wait until the tables were reconfigured to accommodate our party.  We were finally seated and our server asked if we wanted drinks. We asked for water and beer. The first round of drinks were correct, however the server did not notice when our drinks were empty and needed refills. When ordering a refill of a beer, the server brought the incorrect drink. We had to walk up to the bar to exchange our beers for the correct ones. We waited before doing so however our server was no where to be found.  We ordered calamari as our appetizer. Unfortunately the breading was missing on a few pieces and the breaded ones tasted like the calamari was fried in recycled oil. When we received our appetizer, we had to ask the hostess for utensils because we were never given any when seated.  My son ordered a steak. He told the waiter he wanted medium rare, I told the waiter no, medium. My son received well done. The waiters response ""you told me medium well"". We asked for a new steak because it was certainly over cooked. That was the first time we realized we may have been irritating our waiter. My son also ordered a side of macaroni and couscous, and a second side of just couscous. When his food arrived, it was both the same macaroni and couscous. The macaroni and couscous tasted like soggy left over couscous thrown into macaroni. The cheese tasted like the nacho cheese you eat with nachos at a baseball game. The kicker- the credit card fiasco. We were ready for our bill and the server said he would be back with our (separate) checks. We waited and waited, and tried to flag down someone. I felt bad we had been at the restaurant for 2 hours, waiting for a majority of the time. I never like being ""those people"" who sit and hold up a table, however there was no one waiting for a table and there were plenty of empty ones.  We finally received our bill, and gave the waiter our credit card. When he returned with the receipts and cards, the bill changed to our card was incorrect. We noticed another guy flagging down the same waiting with the same problem; our credit cards and charges were mixed up. There goes another 20 minutes trying to find our waiter to settle our credit card Fiasco.  There is no way I would ever return to BJs. The server seemed annoyed with us correcting him and I felt bad at first but then I think about how much attention he really gave us. We had dirty plates from appetizers on our table, and we had to request our plates get taken away. It's one thing to mess up once and be sincere about it, it's another to make patrons feel like we are bothersome to you.    Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2
John  F.,"Oceanside, CA",13,38,1,4.0,12/13/2017,"I haven't been to BJ's in a few months. So my wife and I visited this location this evening for dinner! Man what a pleasure! The consistency of the food is great! The service top notch! Our server Lauren Smiley, was a pleasure and adds to the good time! I should mention the support team was there as well! I always think there are to many choices but given that their all pretty darn good so be it!  Another thing, my wife wanted to speak to the Chef, first to compliment the team and also to  comment on a change she noticed in the soups. So we met Jesus Bermudez, young, professional and well spoken! He listened and said it will be noted and welcomed customer feed-back! That nice to see is a large chain like BJs.

Kristel D.,"Escondido, CA",7,2,1,1.0,12/11/2017,"Third time ordering to-go from here, and it's getting increasingly disappointing. First time, everything was in order. Second time, Hickory Smoked Brisket burger had to be thrown away because of the sauce tasting rancid. Third time, different order, our Deluxe Guac/Bacon Cheese burger had about 2-3 pieces of bacon, an inch long directly in the center. Don't think I'm recommending/holding any events here any time soon.

David J.,"Carlsbad, CA",1,43,,4.0,12/25/2017,"After some last-minute Christmas Eve shopping we (me, wife, 17-year-old daughter) went here for dinner. I had the Grand Cru beer on tap (excellent, and was recommended by our waitress), my wife had a bloody mary (she enjoyed it), and my daughter had several glasses of raspberry lemonade. All of our dinners were really good. My wife had the kate/broccoli salad with salmon. My daughter had the boneless chicken wings. I had the prime rib. More on the prime rib ... this is only available on the weekend after 4pm. Last time I was at BJ's it was a weekday so I couldn't try this dish - I'm glad I came back. The dinner comes with a salad (my Caesar was very good), two sides (green beans, which were not hot, and rice pilaf, which was good). The prime rib was very good. It was cooked to order (Medium rare, of course) but looked a bit smaller than the advertised 15 ounces. I declined the horseradish sauce and had raw horseradish with my au-jus. Again, it was very good. The dinner also comes with a full-sized Pazookie, which we devoured. A good value for the price. Our service was very good - all in all a nice way to spend Christmas Eve dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2
Steve H.,"Del Mar, San Diego, CA",20,86,89,5.0,6/22/2017,"We descended on BJ's with a Big group.. 24 people, and BJ's really came through for us.  They reserved two tables for 12 each, and we had what felt like our own full-service wait staff, even at peak Friday lunchtime.  That's impressive.  Full restaurant, and still available parking -- that's a plus. The deep-dish pizza was a hit, and filling for everyone.  We served everyone with BJ's Favorite, 5-meat, Veggie, and BBQ Chicken.  No complaints and everyone left stuffed. The menu is long, and the beer list is dazzling.. as extensive as it is varied. The five stars here was earned by BJ's staff, who was enthusiastically helpful throughout.  Never an empty glass, and the pacing was perfect. I was surprised they did not include a fixed gratuity in the tab for such a large party, as seems common now; all the better.      A real pleasure to visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2
Aaron H.,"Escondido, CA",10,76,40,4.0,6/16/2017,"Service here was great! Came in late one night to talk things over with a buddy and the hostess was super attentive, getting a booth ready within a couple minutes. We weren't looking for food but once I saw the pulled pork burger I was all for that! We had a few tasters and really liked their house porter. BJ's beers have always been on the more mild side and I am fine with that. Nothing wrong with no having to worry about getting a super hoppy taste from an IPA or getting an excessively bitter/dark taste from a porter.

Me my friend walked into the bar area which is self seating, we sat at one of the high-tops and no server approached for about 10 minutes despite the bar area being very empty. Once the server stopped by we asked if we could move to booths next to our high-top and she was ok with it. Ordered about 3 dishes (Chicken wings, mushrooms with spinach and cheese, California club flat bread). Flatbread was over baked where it was bit hard to bite on, toppings were less compared to other BJ's I had. Chicken Wings had little excessive bbq sauce and was over powering the wings, Mushrooms with spinach and cheese was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2

Caleb T.,"Encinitas, CA",90,396,826,4.0,8/28/2016,"Kind of surprised I've never written a review for this place... I mean, I've come here often enough, typically out of indifference to someone else's choice.  As far as chain restaurants go, you could do much worse.  Everything I've eaten here has been average or a little above.  Most appetizers are precooked, frozen, heated to a hint over warm, and served with bottled sauces.  Food is salty and sweet, not much spice or acid to help cut through any of the grease.  But all pizzas are still a step or so better than you would get at Pizza Hut or Papa Johns, the burgers and chicken on par with your local Chili's. All of this together may sound like the makings of a three or even three and a half star review, and I would leave it there if not for one thing ... those damned Pazookies. Moist, gooey, sugary sweet, laden with cold and melting ice cream, and served in a variety of flavors that seem to cycle with current tastes.  Red Velvet, Salted Caramel, good ole' Chocolate Chip or Peanut Butter, these things are basically half baked cookies with a couple scoops of something on top and there's no leaving BJ's without getting one.  Typically the outer edges are burned, difficult to get out of the pan without forceful scraping, and when you do your spoon gains that tangy aluminum taste that makes your face sour up.  The rest of that Pazookie, though ... damn. Honestly, BJ's is probably best around happy hour, a drink or two, maybe an appetizer, and a tableful of Pazzokies while you laugh with friends and keep clicking on nearby PokeStops.  Do dinner if you have to, but don't leave without that hot cookie and ice cream and you can go away with a bit of a smile and a fairly happy stomach thinking this place is the weak four star place that it is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=20

So crunchy and crispy, and the honey sriracha sauce is perfectly balanced. We always ask for extra sauce! According to their nutrition facts they're actually not that caloric, but I am very suspicious. I don't think there's any way to achieve that delicious crispy texture without deep frying.

The only good thing was plenty of parking spots.  Why the 2 stars? - on Sunday around 6 PM, the wait was over 25 minutes for a party of 2. They initially said 10-15 minutes but it took 25 minutes.  - overpriced food (most of the entrees were between $11-20); medium pizza for $21  - food was mediocre: our tomato bisque soup was not even warm and tasted like it came out of a can; our pizza was super greasy, had no tomato sauce, and had minimal toppings (we got only a few pieces of each topping); our salad only filled half of the plate. - lack of service: our server was clearly waiting too many tables; we had to flag him down for extra water, napkins, the check and a to-go box. he was nice but did not check in with us at all.  - love their pizookie but the size had not changed over the years but the price keeps going up! it's now $7-8 for one pizookie which can fed 1-2 people depending on how hungry you are at the end of your meal.  For the price, I feel you can get so much more and better quality/taste at other restaurants around San Diego.

The rest of the food is ok, but the deep dish pizza is pretty darn tasty! The buffalo chicken pizza is one my favorites. Also if you sign up for the rewards card you get emails that give you some good rewards. Sometimes its a free pizookie and sometimes it a buy one entree and get one half off or free. Also they notify you about the beer and food pairings.  The beer and food pairings are pretty cool! I have been to a few of them over the past years and each one has been different.

The best way to describe it is: it has a menu like the Cheesecake Factory, it's an upscale version of AppleBee's, and it has its own brew options like Karl Strauss. I think I got it?!? For an appetizer, we got the boneless chicken wings and it was good, but it was a bit dry for some pieces, bone in would have been better, but my friend wanted boneless. For our main course, I got the fully loaded tator tots bowl. FIRST OFF, I didn't know BJ's had a tot's section but for this location, they had three different tots bowl to choose from. I got the fully loaded without the sour cream. It was delicious and though some tots were soggy on the bottom, it's my fault for not eating it fast enough.

We were looking for a decent dinner that the kids would enjoy, too, after Legoland.  And it came up first on Yelp.  They told us a 45-minute wait to seat a group of 9, and the kids were starting to squirm.  The GM recognized our kids and my husband from the neighborhood (nice surprise) and bumped us up in the queue, so we were seated in about 15 minutes.  Very cool! Our server was a trainee and she did really well.  She was funny and made us feel at home.   Good food does take a while to come out, and the kids were starting to melt down after the long day.  When it did come out, everything was hot and delicious.  My sister and mom ordered wedge salads that were just the right size for starters.  I ordered a gluten free pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms and sausage. It was good for gluten free.  GF crust is usually cardboard, but it was soft and chewy.  My son got the kids deep dish cheese pizza, no tomatoes (thanks to the servers for warning us that all pizzas come with chopped tomatoes - he would not have liked that).  My daughter ordered the kids sliders with salad.  My husband ordered the hickory brisket barbecue burger, which he really liked.

I used to eat at a location in Boulder, CO and I was so happy when I realized there was a location close by when I moved. My husband and I frequent BJ's at this location every few months. Usually it's a week night dinner or a lunch on a weekend afternoon. We ALWAYS sit in the bar. First come first served seating. They even have booths available. The menu is huge, just like a cheesecake factory, so be prepared to be overwhelmed there. I always used to get giant baked potatoes but sadly that is no longer part of the menu. The most recent occasion they were advertising a $10 off of $35 food order. We over ordered a bit so we could make that threshold and bring some food home. We weren't drinking their delicious beers this time and had an iced tea and diet coke instead. The waitress was quick to bring a refill sometimes even before we had finished the first. Which was really nice. We ordered a mini deep dish pizza to share with the works. They were 1/2 off during happy hour. This was REALLY good. Way better than I expected. My husband ordered something new off their menu, a peanut soba noodle bowl. What was so nice is it came out with fresh veggies, big green pieces of fresh broccoli and carrots. I would have expected frozen out of a chain so it was a nice surprise.  I ordered the roast beef dip sandwich. Great au jus and horseradish sauce.

Ryan M.,"Flagstaff, AZ",158,27,4,1.0,3/26/2017,"The management at this place is a joke!!  I just moved back to San Diego from Hawaii.. Naturally, I'm searching for jobs. I had it pretty good in Hawaii, in terms of work. I owned and operated my own dive company. I have been very successful at selling myself throughout my life, in part due to the 18 years of sales and customer service experience I have obtained through hard work and an unparalleled work ethic instilled in me by my late father.  Last week I came across a job posting from the above company, it was 3 days old, and had several position attached to it. I applied for everything except the bar. With the 8 years of experience in the food industry I have done damn near everything in a restaurant except work the bar.  Immediately following completion of the online app I called the establishment and spoke to Jack. He informed me of what position were still available and asked me to come down and speak to Phong the following morning at 11am. I arrived 10 minute early, waited till they opened and was told right away that Phong wasn't working this day. So I spoke to the Kitchen manager, who didn't give his name and didn't really care to speak with me. He brushed me off and pretty much told me to come back another time.  First off.. my time is just as valuable as yours Mr. Kitchen Manager.. At this point I was discouraged, because I have never sat through a proper interview and not been offered a job. I wasn't about to just waste my morning by going home without talking to someone. So I asked to speak to the opening manager. Who is a complete tool by the way. His name was either Ruiz or Luis idk I didn't really care to record his name in my memory banks because I waited an hour for him to come and talk to me. He didn't come and talk to me out of professionalism that much is for sure. It was out of courtesy because I sat there as long as I did. This guy couldn't even tell me what positions were available.. he also said that he didn't think I had enough experience without even looking at my resume. I think he assumed I was some fresh 20 year old with no work experience (judging from the way he was talking to me) not a 32 year old who has been working since he was 15. Granted I look a lot younger then I am because I live a healthy life style. He made it seem working at BJ's is the peak of a career in the industry. I didn't even bother following up with these clowns. Before I left I took a look at some of the kids they have working there and chuckled because I know I can run circles around them. Rest assured the very next place I went to hired me on the spot. uhhh, because he looked at my resume!! I use to frequent BJ's in grossmont and always favored it as one of my favorite places to eat.

About 10 min later the kids meal....still waiting for appetizers.  30 min later still waiting for appetizers and food.  Oh yay finally our cold burgers and fries came to the table but no potato skins....the server says do u still want them?  Umm no we now have our meal....its cold but we are now eating kinda pointless to get the appetizer now.   Not even half way done with our meal and she brings the check and boxes and kindly says i had the manager take the potato skins off since u never got them....oh how nice of you REALLY....thats a given im not about to pay for food that I didnt eat.  Sorry should not have even paid for the cold ass burger but i did.....so PISSED....we will skip BJs Carlsbad the next time we are in the area!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=80

The ribs were great and mac n cheese and guacamole. You go out to be waited on. We had to ask for refills, napkins everything. It was a birthday celebration and she didnt make him feel special. This girl should have 2 tables bad, bad bad she was horrible. Where are the food runners? You need more people to fill drinks etc. We spent all together close to 350.00 better to go fast food place.

We get home 10 minutes later and saw 2 sad looking regular size chocolate chunk pizookies. They didn't even bother to put enough cookie dough to cover the entire small tray. (picture posted).  The mini peanut butter pizookie looked fine.  Came time for us to finally eat these pizookies... Both cookies were way too undercooked. If I wanted cookie dough in a tray, I could have made that myself for less than $8 each! Such a disappointment. How can you mess up cookies??? And having a really busy night is not an excuse!!! It's a damn cookie baked in its own pan!!  Any other time we've ordered these, they have always been delicious. Never again.. And may not go back due to the lack of quality.

Same food and drink experience (which including the pizookie would make this a five star rating) but a very poor service experience. Our server was curt, short with us and rude. With our 19 month old there, he wanted nothing to do with our table. He was friendly and flirtatious with the table of girls next to us but rarely said a word at our table. We seemed like an inconvenience to him the whole time. The last blow, we forgot our daughter's blanket at the table and when we came back, he had thrown it away.

I tried out the vanilla cream soda and the new hickory brisket and bacon burger. It was a pretty good sized hamburger and there were plenty of fries on the side. The burger had some char around the edges and gave it a taste like it was cooked on a BBQ grill. The sauce was a sweeter kind of BBQ sauce, it was good, but I think it would be better a little spicier. I could only finish half of it because I had a lot of fries on the side. The soda was pretty good, and after I finished it the waitress asked if I wanted to try one of the other flavors. I tried the black cherry soda, and it was much better than the vanilla one. The menu says they're made with real sugar and brewed by them, so I thought that was pretty cool. The service was good, but a bit slow because of the whole veterans day thing.

My recommended dishes are: Parmesan Crusted Chicken, Atlantic Salmon, Deep dishes pizzas, wedge salad, southwestern egg rolls, pazookies, and if you're craving a budget friendly steak, the ribeye.  So tonight I had the ribeye. Not bad for a non steakhouse place. Nice thick cut and not too chewy. Not marbled, but still had a good taste. I added a dash of salt, but didn't mind because I rather it be under seasoned and not over seasoned and salty. Asked for medium rare and got medium, which is ok too.

Audrianna H.,"Casa Grande, AZ",0,9,3,2.0,4/15/2017,"We ordered To-Go to bring back to our hotel room last night, and it was not a great experience. We placed our order online - no hiccups there. The real fun started when we arrived at the restaurant to pick up. Upon arrival, the young woman behind the counter was putting completed boxes of food in the warmer and completely ignoring the line of people behind her. When she finally addressed us, she was disinterested. I paid for our food and then proceeded to wait 30 minutes for them to pull it together. Once the food was ""ready"", I went through it on the counter and it was missing three things. Informed them of two (I forgot to mention the third, so we didn't get our side salad) and received them a few minutes later. Arriving back at the hotel, I realized that we were also missing the toppings for our baked potatoes that we had paid for.  The food was okay. Steak was good and cooked correctly. Baked potatoes were dry without the toppings. Tomato mozzarella salad was bland and tomatoes under ripe.  I did feel sympathy for the guy behind the counter that assisted to be training the young woman. On a busy Friday night, he was up to his eyeballs in orders and ornery stuff, and also having to train. He was extremely apologetic for the wait and very kind.  Probably won't be back to BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=60

Mikayla G.,"Oceanside, CA",4,24,22,1.0,1/13/2017,"I am really disappointed with my last 2 visits. Last Monday we came and got a trio pizookie to go but when we got our order the ice cream was on the hot cookie (so obviously melting), so when I brought it to the waiters attention they took it back. Instead of providing pizookies that hadn't been topped with ice cream all they did was take the ice cream off and put it in a to go container. Not a huge deal but it's frustrating. Then last Sunday, we ordered a medium BJ's classic without mushrooms. When it was delivered (not by our waiter) we noticed the mushrooms and asked that they be taken off. Our waiter then delivered it again, announcing no mushrooms. We started eating it and found that it still had mushrooms. Apparently it was taken back and the mushrooms were just picked off. So they only caught what they could see. When we complained, he offered to take it back and get a new pizza. The new one came out and he was apologetic and said we will ""take it off"" so when I got the bill, I was very surprised that what they were taking off was the pizza that they got wrong twice not the new one. To me I shouldn't have to pay for something I didn't order. I was just really put off by the lack of customer service (no offer for a discount off the price of the pizza we ate because we had to wait even longer).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=60
Dan R.,"San Diego, CA",78,17,,1.0,12/11/2016,"I went there yesterday with my fiance and future mother-in-law. We ordered some beers a flatbread, deep dish pizza and a salad. The side salad was perfectly acceptable however when the pizza came out it went downhill. The deep dish pizza was lukewarm at best and if you rang it out im pretty sure you would wind up with a gallon of oil. Pizza regardless of type does not need to be prepared this way. The flatbread came out cold. When my mother in law asked the waitress to fix it, she brought it back, heated it up for a few seconds and it was back on the table. Now I am well aware that with chain restaurants like this, heating up frozen food, as this flatbread clearly was is common practice. However I do not want to have the food taste like it was frozen. It was rubbery, impossible to cut and tasted horrible. Then the waitress brought us the check. As we were putting in our credit cards she rushed back out saying she had forgotten to add two five oz tasters to the check. I get mistakes and have no qualms paying an extra five bucks but on principle if you make a mistake at a restaurant then you should own it considering the horrible food and novice service.  It is highly unlikely I will come back to any BJ's. If companies read reviews please take this as a chance to fix your issues because I rarely if ever feel the need to write a negative review unless the experience was THAT horrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=60

Rob P.,"Jacksonville, NC",70,289,241,3.0,4/29/2016,"I love the amount of variety this place has!  However, every time we have visited, its always been either half full or maybe 10 other couples/families there, and always find ourselves waiting an average of 10 minutes for a table.  Its like the waiters/waitress are playing paper, rock, scissors in the back for who is going to take the table. I like variety and sometimes in the mood for different things, but more than not, when I find something I really really like, I go to that place specifically for that.  BJ's is my place for deep dish Mediterranean pizza.  However they do have an amazing baked ziti dish, that is super greasy, but so good (that's my 3 stars).  It has been the ONLY meal that comes out hot and seems somewhat fresh.  The pizza is always luke warm, but by the time it comes out (because with like 4 other couples in there, they must be slammed in the kitchen) I'm so hungry I just eat it, instead of making the family sit there and wait for my food to come out after they are already done.

What I like about BJ's is that they have a huge menu so there is something for everyone.  Even their signature deep dish pizza isn't appealing to you, you'll have a book of other options from which to choose including appetizers, hearty entrees, small plates and desserts. I'm not a deep dish pizza person but i do really enjoy the parmesan encrusted chicken here and the entree size is large enough to enjoy as a second meal.  Overall, all of the food here is good which is impressive which such a large selection.  The kitchen must be bustling! As implied by the name, BJ's also has a long beer list.  BJ's brews a wide variety of beer which are good but nothing that I crave.  They also have a full bar for those wanting a non-BJ's beer, cocktail or glass of wine. When this location first opened I found the service to be good but on recent visits its been dismal.  The worst service is if you sit on the patio because they seem to forget you are out there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=60

I usually sit at the bar... I was there last night (my first time at this location) and the bartender, a female with long brown hair was absolutely inattentive and barely acknowledged me. She acted like I was a bother to her. Had to flag her down for everything and she had very unwelcoming vibe to her. Barely said 2 words to me the entire time... she was busy doing her closing cleaning up for the night and that was 10:05pm... almost 2hrs before closing.  Didn't ask if I needed another beer, didn't ID me either and forgot to give me plate and didn't give me water either. Had to flag her down to order food, beer..for everything and every time she acted like I was wasting her time. I usually tip between 25% to 40% and last night was the first time I left Bjs without tipping.... that speaks for itself.  I suggest you try different location - highly recommend the La Jolla/UTC or Mission Valley locations...they're happy to serve you there.

The problem I have had--not only today when I went for lunch, but every time I have eaten here--is that of trying to find any help mid-meal in a decent amount of time. Today's experience included having a hard time acquiring: drink refills, silverware (after our food had arrived), half of the food order, the check (both to be dropped off and to have our cards run), and two to-go pazookies. Altogether we spent a little over two hours in the restaurant when we could have been--and very much would have liked to have been--out in half of the time. I work in a restaurant.

If you're coming strictly for the service I wouldn't hold your breath, if you're coming strictly for the food- it's not that great I would consider going somewhere else. I first started with a wait of about 40 minutes to get in, understandably as it is a Friday night. However, once we were finally seated it took too long to get appetizers and our meals. Our first appetizer came and was actually incorrect- we requested our boneless wings however we received wings with bone in which was not what we had requested. The meals themselves were okay. I ordered the cherry glazed salmon which was good but the snow peas had a very tarty almost sour sauce which actually hurt my stomache. The children ordered corn dogs, chicken strips, and mini burgers which they consumed without a problem so I'm assuming all was fine. However my husband ordered a shrimp jambalaya with chicken as a substitute and it was bland. The cook simply put a lot of spices on the plate rim itself so as not to put it in the food. We had to constantly ask our server or look for our server for things we needed such as ketchup, refills, napkins etc. We waited about 20 minutes after the meal was completed in order to be able to receive our check to go.

Eric E.,"Carlsbad, CA",1,7,1,2.0,6/8/2016,"Super bummed to be leaving this review...  I want to make it clear that I have loved this restaurant for years and have been to a ton of locations.  This was my first time at this location and not a good experience for me.   Short version : We had unkind, poor service that took well over an hour to have just soup and salads for lunch. My experience: I was meeting up for a quick lunch with a friend and arrived first.  I told the hostess that there would be two of us for lunch and she kindly asked me to wait at the top of the stairs (I was expecting to be met by someone who would then take me to table).  I waited there for about ten minutes, when my friend arrived.  She asked if I'd requested a table and said yes, the hostess asked me to wait here.  A few more minutes went by and the hostess finally approached us and asked if we'd been helped.  I mentioned that she asked me to wait here. Off to our seats!  Finally (elapsed time ~13 minutes)...  It was a nice day so we sat on the patio.  We discussed possibly getting a pint of the newly advertised beer and chose our food.  We sat patiently as we awaited our waitress.  Our waitress came to take our drink orders (elapsed time ~20 mins).  We asked to try to the new beer and placed our food orders -- unlimited soup and salad lunch and a cobb salad.  She said most who have tried the new beer haven't liked it, but I am a big fan of BJs beers so I thought I'd give it a try. Our food, water, and beer samplers arrived (elapsed time ~45 mins, mind you we each have hour lunch breaks).  The beer was bad.  We didn't order any after the sampler.  The food was pretty good, as to be expected from many visits to other BJs locations.  Unfortunately, because it took so long to get our food, I was unable to enjoy the ""unlimited"" aspect of my order.  We requested our check and a to go box for the rest of my friend's Cobb salad.  We kindly mentioned we needed to get going because our lunch breaks were over (elapsed time ~55 mins). My friend's schedule was a bit more strict and she called into work to let them know she'd be late.  We both work within less than a mile from this location.  After about ten minutes, she went inside to ask for the check and box.  During this time, guests at a nearby table had gotten up and left, having waited a considerable length of time for service.  My friend returned and said that our waitress, of which we'd had several, was just inside chatting up the hostess.  A few minutes later she set the check on the table and walked away, as we both sat with cards in hand, expecting to just give her our cards. Our waitress returned and took our cards (elapsed time ~65 mins).  She came back in five minutes later asking if we wanted to split it down the middle.  This was the worst part, it took another five minutes for her to return.   Conclusion: As I mentioned from the start, I am super bummed to be sharing this experience.  Now, I understand that occasionally there are staffing issues.  Occasionally someone is having a bad day.  Therefore, I will definitely be giving this place another chance, especially since I have enjoyed other locations so many times.  I hope they earn my confidence back the next go around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=140

Teresa R.,"Vista, CA",3,5,8,1.0,5/18/2016,"A friend and I decided to swing by this place last night for the 2 for $25 they advertised.  Came in waited about 10 minutes or so to be seated. The waitress who initially helped us, I was given the impression, was rushed and not too concerned for our table. She took our drink order as well as noted we were in for the 2/$25 deal and rushed off. It was a tad busy when we arrived, however, I've seen this place at peek traffic time before and had far better of an experience then. It had most definitely thinned out by the time our table was taken over by the second waiter.  We received our drinks (2 sodas and 2 waters) and our salads soon followed. At this time she introduced us to Chris whom would be taking over the table. He seemed pleasant at first but as the night wore on proved to be inattentive and scattered.  After our salads we waited a good 30 minutes for the main dish to arrive and when it did, it was a bit overcooked and cold. At this point we just didn't care as we were already hungry. The waiter checked in maybe once with us before he brought the check. Now, this deal comes with: 2 salads, a choice of pizza and a pizookie to share. If sodas were added they were advertised to be a charge of only $1 each... Clearing that up, when we received our check we had not received the dessert yet. Chris was informed of this, yet as the waiter taking over a table it is his responsibility to take care to know these facts before closing out the bill. He expressed to us he wasn't even aware of what we had ordered and left. It then took about another 20-25 minutes to get the dessert. We received the check again and realized we were overcharged for the sodas. We paid the bill as it was considering we had been there nearly 2 hours when it was meant to be a quick dining experience. This is more so a review of service. I would come to this location quite often and would hold various business meetings here as well. I was astounded by the lack of care of the staff. They seemed more concerned with carrying on personal conversations rather than attending to the customers whom are the reason they have a job in the first place. I am sorely disappointed with the conduct displayed within this organization and it has not only been displayed to me as of last night. I have been coming here for years but am now having serious doubts as to the direction this company is headed. Sorely disappointed and doubtful I will set foot in this establishment again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=140

Sarah S.,"Encinitas, CA",20,63,25,1.0,7/28/2016,"We called ahead for a party of 14 to give them enough time. Got there and they sat 10 of us together and the other 4 at another table. So much for celebrating this birthday at the same table. Then come to find out each table was in a different section with a different server. So the 4 top all had drinks while we had not even seen a server. At the end it flipped flopped, we got our checks while the four top had not seen there server since their food was dropped off. They also forgot two burgers, everyone was eating and I noticed they didn't say anything about how long do I asked. She hadn't even noticed she didn't bring them. Apparently they were given to another table. They got their burgers while everyone else was done eating. In general we spent too much time just waiting for service. We would have to flag random servers for assistance. Restaurant wasn't even that busy and they couldn't of been that short if servers had time to chat it up with the host. I don't know what happened, I don't know if the host messed up communication or what but regardless the servers were not on top of their tables. Will not return based on service and the fact that the burgers were not discounted in any way.  On another note to BJ's please do not call your pizza deep dish. It only made it halfway up the pan of that and did not have layers of cheese.

So coming to order food, I had a hard trying to pick what I wanted.. there were so many options!! Burgers, steaks, ribs, sushi, appetizers, deserts.. I wanted it all! So I settled for the ribs, Brussels sprouts and asparagus! ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! You would think late at night the cooks would be tired and the food would be crappy but the ribs were juicy and falling off the bone. It was spectacular, my hands and face were full of juicy goodness.  The beer was fantastic, I got the berry cider or as i like to call booze juice.

Lindsey M.,"Vista, CA",204,252,321,4.0,2/26/2014,"Had me at the spinning door and sizable menu! The vibe of BJs is one of class meets sports bar, after all, it's in the beautiful city of Carlsbad. The lighting is dim, the upholstery is dark, and much of the place is wooded, making for one warm environment but look up, there's flatscreens rocking football! Date-night good or group of friends/Opening Game night good!! Our hostess was a doll, friendly and personable and our server was as equally sociable: genuine, sweet, and high-energy.  Appetizer: Spinach stuffed mushrooms! Cradled in the mushroom is artichoke dip, cheese, and a lemony pesto; how your mouth will wish there were more than 6 on the plate (3 each if you HAVE to share with your date or signif. other)  Entrees: I guess I was on a lemon  and artichoke bender, because post-appetizer I had one phenomenal plate of Tuscan Chicken Limone. Chicken so soft and delectable, nestled in angel hair pasta coated in lemon butter sauce and sprinkled with dried tomatoes and artichoke. The man had a hankering for  burger, but to take the road less traveled, he asked for the Bison burger. What? No fries!? I guess the cold slaw was going to have to suffice! Drinks: I was the only one to dabble in the alcohol the evening of our visit, but wasn't feeling the heaviness of a beer or the zest of a margarita. I settled on the Island Sunset because SVEDKA makes me happy aaaaand because the small child in my brain does dances when I see pineapple juice and orange juice in the same sentence/drink. I really enjoyed this drink until half-way through when it started to taste...really flat :( Aha! Must've been the Sierra Mist and Grenadine at work!

L V.,"Vista, CA",1,15,2,2.0,9/30/2016,"This was unfortunately a very poor experience and the only reason they get two stars tonight is because the food actually does taste decent as far as restaurant chains go.  We had two kids 6 and under with us and were told 15-20 minutes for a table; this was a HORRIBLE gauge of time because the restaurant was packed. We waited an hour. 30 mins into the wait my sister went up to check on our position on the wait list and ALL THREE hostesses ignored her for five minutes before acknowledging her presence at the hostess booth, which was literally one foot away from their persons.  When we FINALLY were taken to our table an hour after arrival, one of the very very tall waiters was walking through our party to cut us off and get to a table as we walked to ours, almost kicking one of our kids because he wasn't even professional enough to wait for us to pass. RUDE.  We asked for drinks while the person who seated us blindly recited the drink menu and ignored our request before telling us our waiter would be by to serve us, and then walked off. When our waiter came 15 mins after being seated, to our chagrin, it was the really really tall waiter who almost ran one of our kids over. He didn't smile; he barely seemed pleasant. We hurriedly gave him our drink order, kids food order, and our appetizer order so we could take time to discuss entree options and whether we wanted to eat there or not. We waited another 15-20 mins and I finally had to flag someone down just so we could get our drinks. It took another five minutes before he returned with the drinks (along with six other tables drinks), and by that time our kids were falling asleep, no food for them had been served yet. It was Mac n cheese and a mini pizza. This isn't a delicacy requiring more than 10-15 min of cook time and plating.  We decided we were not going to order food, no one seemed to care, our waiter barely cared that we voiced concerns over wait time for meals, which was why we were holding off on getting food for ourselves.  When our food finally came, it was two small mushroom appetizers that were lukewarm, which meant it had been sitting out waiting to be served for a while. It was good but disappointing to find it wasn't hot and fresh.  We ordered via app Chilis to Go while we waited for our check.  Terrible service tonight, we've eaten at this location many many many times and spent hundreds of dollars, it's sad to see that as of late the quality has been unimpressive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=160

After speaking with the hostess twice, another party of the same size was seated before ours and we were told to have to wait longer until they were able to group two more tables.

Chris G.,"Oceanside, CA",0,9,1,1.0,6/25/2016,"You won't believe this but this is the honest truth.  Coming home from long day with kids at water park, my family and our friends took our kids for a late night (9pm) dinner and dessert here on Saturday. None of us had ever had any negative experiences here before but tonight was all-time.  There was a 30 min wait...at 9pm!  So we snatched a big booth in the bar area.   As the busser finished cleaning and wiping down table for us I noticed what I thought to be a piece of lettuce on the floor under the table. I used my shoe to brush it to the front so that the bus boy would clean it up.  To everyone's HORROR it was a used CONDOM. How does that get there??!!!  To be honest I can't believe that I must tell you that we stayed to eat after that.  We called the manager over and while he cleaned it up with broom and he apologized, he actually did not seem overly apologetic nor did he offer/comp us anything.   If I was in his shoes I would be absolutely mortified!  We never saw him again that night.   Rest of the night: Service was very slow but we were in the quasi bar/lounge area so I could understand that a bit.  Food was average at best.  Ordered a small deep dish bbq chicken pizza. It was warm at best and not that tasty. Mostly bread With very little bbq sauce or cheese .   I ordered a beer but I had to remind the waiter 5 min later that he had not brought it to me...and we were in the bar!!! Both families ordered a pizookie dessert.  It is a cookie warmed up with 3 scoops ice cream. Our ice cream was nearly fully melted by time it arrived. It was ok but way too sugary for my taste.  My daughters clam chowder bread bowl was good.  I still cannot believe that nothing more was done for us regarding the used condom. We hoped that the table before us played a joke but the reality is likely that employees got it on after hours the night before.  #Classy! I had to come back to edit after I read a few recent reviews. After 1 review from 2 weeks ago mentioned how dirty the place was the GM replied on Yelp by saying he was sorry that their ""usual gold standard"" wasn't experienced.  Wow!  I've never seen dirty used condoms in a booth before!  Is that the gold standard??  Cmon man.

Rhomel D.,"Oceanside, CA",805,364,82,3.0,5/24/2014,"Why 3 stars instead of 4? Reason being is because I personally think there is hundreds of places like BJ's and what only separates them from other similar restaurants, is there wide selection of there home brewed beers...without that, there more like Chilis but with more seating and less crying babies. Their food is delicious and their service here is somewhat of a hit or a miss...I came here a few nights ago and the restaurant was not even a quarter packed. Well the 2 hostess they had working were not professional (checking their cell phone, chit chatting about what they were gonna do for the weekend) and we were seated waiting for a hostess to seat us. The whole time I was staring at them and I didnt think either one of them was going to seat us and to my surprise one of them looked up and it was the one looking at her cell phone and the first thing she said was ""oh, crap im sorry"" Yeah.....oh crap is right. From there it didnt seem like it could get any better from there but it slowly did. I asked our server if they could make me an Old Fashion with Tequila and she said she would go check. She came back and told me that the manager said it would cost me $20 for that drink!?!? ARE YOU SERIOUS??? That drink is normally $10 no more than that, so I went ahead to choose a different drink that wouldnt cost more than their expensive pasta dish. Then our server came back and she said she spoke with another bartender and she said it would only cost me $10 if I still wanted it. So, I went for it! Overall after the seating experience and confusion with the drink pricing it turned out a pretty good night. Without my humorous conversation with my gf and poking fun at some of the people who were dining I probably wouldnt of had given this place 3 stars. But im a bit of a harsh critic (straight to the point).

Baylee O.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,9,1,2.0,1/14/2017,"Tonight I ordered 2 pizzas using the online ordering service. The website seemed like they made it really easy to get what you want. I myself ordered the Mediterranean with the chicken and pepperoncinis on one side only. When we got there everything seemed to be running smooth but thankfully we checked the pizza before leaving. Chicken was on the whole thing which is not doable as I am a vegetarian. Our curbside attendant was polite and apologized and clarified what we wanted and went to go have it remade. Well the new one comes about 20 minutes later. Still wrong. This is a negative review towards the pizza chef and preps as it should not be this hard to make a $30 pizza right with one try let alone two. While I was extremely disappointed with the chefs, Dalton who helped us did an amazing job. He had a great personality, was funny, apologetic, and asked what he could do to make this right. Way to go Dalton! Horrible job from the chefs as the pizza was wrong and honestly not even good.

Joe S.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,14,,2.0,7/25/2015,"I really wanted to like BJ's.  Having just moved to Carlsbad, my wife and I have been trying to find a casual place with good food and drink and a friendly atmosphere for our two young kids.   The atmosphere is nice.  We have no complaints with this or the service.  Even though the number one complaint with this restaurant seems to be the service, we haven't experience anything resembling poor service.  My biggest gripe is with the food.   I'm a big salad guy.   I know it's not very manly and I do eat red meat from time to time.  I usually seek out an ahi tuna salad if I can find one.  BJ's has this along with a few other good looking salads (at least from the menu perspective).  I ordered the ahi salad for myself and my wife hoping for the best.  What came out of the kitchen was one of the biggest abominations for an ahi tuna salad I have ever seen.  Where do I start.   The greens: browning on the edges, drenched in dressing that seemed to be applied at least an hour or two ago.  The tuna: you simply cannot cut slices of tuna hours ahead of time and expect them to stay fresh.  The tuna had already started to oxidize and turn brown.  Nothing close to the nice red color you usually see at good restaurants. The avocado: overripe and oxidized brown just like the rest of the ingredients.   I was hoping this was an anomaly.  The salads had obviously been prepared some time ago and stashed in a fridge.  You could tell because all ingredients (including the bowl) were all at the same temperature.  Kinda like when you order a salad from McDonalds.   The rare tuna should be served closer to room temperature than the salad for best flavor.    After expressing our concern to the waiter, he apologized and brought out two new ahi salads.   Prior to bringing out the salads, I politely asked the waiter to have the kitchen make two fresh salads instead of bringing us soggy salads from the fridge.   To our horror the new salads looked the same, if not worse than the previous!  Unbelievable!  I've come to the conclusion that BJ's likes to cut big corners by preparing dishes ahead of time and simply reheating or pulling dishes out of the fridge.  Items are not being made to order.  Another small nit picky item is with the soup we ordered.  I asked the waiter to have the soup brought out with the entree salads.  Not 2 minutes after we order, the soup is brought to our table.  I tell the waiter that the soup will be stone cold by the time our salads comes out.  He takes the soup back and brings it out with the entrees. Here's the kicker.  The soup is cold!  Like they left it in the kitchen while the salads were prepared!  Better tomato soup can be had at Panera.  At least they will bring it to you piping hot :) Long story short, we left hungry having not eaten dinner.  At least we didn't have to pay for the gross salads. We won't be going back...which is a shame.  I wanted to like BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=200

Just kidding!"" as if were camping at her table and keeping another group from sitting there and not allowing more tips in her pocket. Were were enjoying the beers we bought from her and catching up on conversation! No crime, right? But immaturity and lack of experience got the best of her. I should have called her over and explained that what she said was inappropriate.   The food- underwhelming. I got the shrimp tacos. Tortillas with some shrimp and white sauce with some chopped tomatoes mixed in. There was a lot of empty space in those tortillas.

Geno P.,"San Diego, CA",131,656,303,4.0,5/26/2014,"BJ's at first site is ... kinda hokey. It's a typical California cliché brewpub, complete with the garage doors and unimaginatively named menu items like ""pizookie."" You can put whatever description you want next to that dish. It won't bother me because I will never, ever, order something called a ""pizookie"" on account of the terrible name alone. I mean, man, it took some real convincing from the wife to even get me through the door of a place called BJ's in the first place. Sorry, but where I'm from, a BJ is somethin' else.  And I don't want to be around other people when they're enjoying a BJ. That said, our experience here was every bit of 4 stars. We did not wait for a table even during prime dinner hour on a Sunday. Also, the main giant TV was showing the NHL Playoffs. Huge win for BJ's on that front. Next, the corn fritter app, for a mere $3.25 (yes, you read that correctly, three frikkin dollars and one quarter) was spot on. I then ate one of the most OUTSTANDING meals I've had in this type of place for a LONG time. It's a stupid balsamic chicken with mashed potatoes, garlic strings, and a mess of salad leaves. I had zero expectations, but my god. I scraped the plate clean. And for only 880 calories! I'm still shocked over how BJ's did this.  It's not a gourmet dish. But sometimes a restaurant hits the nail so squarely on the head it wins me over. I'll be back to try more items next time we're in the vicinity.

I never use salt, but when I do you know it must be pretty tasteless. That's been my overall experience with the food at BJ's, but I love going back for the cool vibe and atmosphere of course the PAZOOKIE!  5 stars for Shahar our server.

Jordyn S.,"Marysville, WA",14,47,16,2.0,9/27/2014,My first time at BJ's and honestly wasn't impressed. We had a group of 6 for a friends birthday and to start off the ladies at the front were in a bad mood. Granted they were crazy busy but still not an excuse to be snippy to customers. We were seated fairly fast for how busy it was. Our waiter was really nice but I'm pretty sure he's new. He messed up on almost everything we ordered. Our beer pitchers that we ordered got mixed up and the food that came to our table wasn't even mine. But I ate it anyways not realizing.  My food was good but everyone else said their food was eh. The ribs were subpar and not worth $22 and the steak was dry.  On top of that we kept getting food delivered to our table that we didn't order. I understand it happening one or two times but it happened 5+ times. No idea they could have that big of a mix up but they did.  Overall the food is eh. Not worth the price! At. All. The service staff was nice but I recommend training your staff a bit more so simple mistakes don't happen over and over. Our servicer was incredibly nice but I don't think he was fully ready to branch out and manage his own tables by himself just yet.  The beers are great and so are the drinks!

Farrah B.,"San Diego, CA",132,46,11,2.0,11/19/2014,"I have been going to this location for a year now. I have had only one positive experience without them screwing up something. Last night was the last straw. I ordered curbside to go.. And ordered online. After I realized I punched in the wrong date to order, I called. An employee picked up the phone and said they'll cancel in and order when I'm ready and hung up. besides the fact that the person hung up, I ordered again. Now with the right date. I drove to the restaurant, a man comes out. Sounds like the same guy on the phone- and asks for the name.. Goes back in and pulls out receipts- and says that they have nothing made for me since the orders ""merged"" He sounds like the same guy on the phone.. He seemed really apologetic, and informed us he's the manager. He asked us to wait 10-15 minutes. Which we agreed to since we already drove there and were hungry. Needless to say I was very forgiving,  and polite. He threw a burnt pazookie In for free. I was thankful for that since I ordered one and it was free. I didn't know the pazookie was burned and charred. I didn't know that the burger we ordered is the wrong one and screwed up the side on it too, how can you get it wrong when you have two identical order at your hands?  Besides the burnt cookie and a plain cheeseburger- I've just had it.  I feel like the waiters and waitresses at this place is super awkward and inexperienced. The manager can't even get things right either. I just don't think it's worth the time or money to dine here. Time after time it's the same thing the order isn't right.  Maybe work on reiterating your orders to your staff and customers before you make anything in the back. I have been working in the food industry for years and having that said- I am forgiving.

Patti P.,"Carlsbad, CA",302,131,53,4.0,9/1/2014,"I am a fan of BJ's.  It's been one of our ""go to"" restaurants when you just want to grab a bite, and not go too far.  We went this evening and I tried a great new little salad called Twisted BLT.  It was fantastic!  They have a lot of choices on the menu which are ""small bites"" and this is one of them.  It is a spinach salad, with finely chopped bacon, egg, tomatoes- and the dressing is a spicy, yet light dressing which has siracha in it.  I LOVED the salad, and it was 220 calories.  It was the perfect size for a starter salad, with just enough kick to make it really good.  I then followed it up with one of my staples- the Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps.  Again, low calories, and a lot of taste.  They are under 350 calories, and I bring home at least 1 of them for lunch the next day.   We've found BJ's good for a group- as there is always something for everyone.  I love their deep dish pizza's there, although I don't indulge too often. And the Pizzoki (probably not spelling it right) are fantastic.  They are basically a cookie, freshly baked in it's own little pan, with ice cream on top.  You can get one large one, or a sampler of 3 different ones.  (What most people don't know is you can also request just 1 of the small ones, which is usually enough to give you a taste of dessert, but not too much!) For those who are beer drinkers, there are a huge assortment of beers available, and their bar there is really attractive, with the bottles arranged beautifully and backlit. All in all, I think BJ's does a good job for a ""chain"" restaurant, and enjoy the smaller and low cal dishes offered there.

The potato skins were hot, thicker then most , and loaded with cheesy bacon goodness! It's a generous portion for an appetizer and filled me up more than excepted . The mini deep dish pizza's were 1/2 off for happy hour and were loaded with toppings. I had the chicken bacon ranch , which was delicious! The edges were crispy and the pizza itself was surprisingly not too heavy of an entree. The pazookie is always a winner, we opted for the cookies and cream option. This comes with a chocolate Oreo cookie, vanilla ice cream , and swirls of cookies and cream frosting YUM, literally every bite melted in my mouth. For an adult beverage I had the fruity cider and I really enjoyed it. It tasted like a spiked martinelles and I can't wait to return !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=180
Brittny K.,"Vista, San Diego, CA",1,31,17,1.0,8/24/2015,"By far the worst restaurant experience I have ever had!! I called and made a reservation for 8:30 last night, the lady said she would do a courtesy reservation for us this one time, which I appreciated. It was a little busy when we first got there, which meant waiting 15 minutes past our reservation time. Our server Dave was very personable and friendly. I told him that I had the mobile app, and we would be ordering on the app so we could get 20% off our check. We ordered our food right away, which was calamari for our appetizer a large shark pizza and a full rack of ribs with a side of clam chowder and a baked potato. After ordering we asked Dave to bring us some bread for our grandma.  15 minutes later, he came back and asked for my BJ rewards number because our order wasn't showing in their system. He leaves with my number and comes back and asks for my phone to scan the barcode, I give him my phone and remind him that we were still waiting on our bread. He comes back with my phone (no bread) and said it was too small to scan, so I gave him my sisters phone to use instead. This time, Scott, who is the general manager? comes with my sisters phone (again, no bread) and says there is an issue and my account number is showing invalid. (which I found puzzling considering I had received email confirmation for signing up, and email confirmation for the food order we had put in). He verbally took our order so we wouldn't have to wait any longer, and said he would get the issue fixed with my account, that way we would still receive our 20% off discount. Considering my step mom who is pregnant and my grandmother who is 82, waiting an hour to get something so simple resolved was annoying and a bit pathetic, so when our server finally came back, we gave him a hard time about still not receiving our bread, and jokingly (but seriously) said our food better be fresh since we had been waiting so long.  He finally comes back with 2 slices of bread and our calamari appetizer. I didn't try the bread, but the calamari wasn't crisp and fresh like I know calamari is supposed to be, however we were so hungry that we wolfed it down.  Finally he comes out with our pizza, ribs and baked potato and asked if he could grab anything else for us. We told him we were missing our clam chowder, so he apologized and went to go grab our soup. As he's in the back, my dad is looking at his ribs and notices something is missing. I'm serving the pizza to my family, and I notice that it's extremely soft. I take a bite of mine, and it's freaking raw and cold. The server comes out, and my dad asks him if he notices anything about his ribs, and the server said it looked burnt and was plated horribly. My dadagrees, but states there's still something else missing, and takes his knife and taps on the top of the rib and asks the server again if he notices what is missing, A little confused, my dad helps him out by pointing out that the meat on the bone is missing. LIterally, the $25 rack of ribs was all bone, no meat.  The server apologizes and goes to get his manager. (Mind you, the general manager never came back to give me status on my account). So LUIS the ""assistant manager"" comes out and rudely asks whats going on here. No, ""I'm sorry I heard there is an issue with your meal, how can I help solve the problem"". My dad explains to him the situation, points out the bones we received and the raw/cold pizza. The guy rudely starts making excuses for the restaurant and asked if we want another rack of ribs instead and another pizza. Frustrated, my dad told him that he was pissing him off because of the excuses he was making and the way he was talking to him. He interrupted my dad and told him not to cuss at him (sorry, I didn't catch the memo where pissed meant you were cussing at someone). My dad then asked for his title, and said he would prefer to speak to Scott, in which Luis offered to go get him. When my dad asked if he was still here, Luis said he had left already for the night (so he basically lied) My dad went on to say the chef should be fired and the guy again interrupted my dad calling him rude.  At this point, I am pissed at the way he's speaking to my father, so I tell Luis how extremely rude HE is being to my father, and how insincere he is over the sitatuation. I explained we had been there for over 90 minutes, and before I could get another word out, he starts interrupting me. I told him to not interrupt me, and what horrible customer service this was, and that we would not be coming back to their restaurant, and I will be in touch with the general manager in regards to his failed ""attempt"" to rectify the situation.  As we leave, my family is walking to the front, and the ""assistant manger"" cuts them off and walks infront without an ""excuse me"" or ""you go first"" or any sort of apology for the time wasted at the restaurant. To me, that was just past the point of disrespectful and blatantly rude.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=180

I absolutely love their pizookies and deep dish pizza. It's probably what their known for.  I am pretty guilty for coming here for their late night happy hour. I think there was one point in time that I was here every other night, but when your live near this area in Carlsbad, it's hard to find a place that's open late. Other things that are really good on their menu is All their BEER! I also really enjoy their hamburgers and their Jambalaya!  Definitely a must have or try! The staff here is always so friendly.

Mari M.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,6,18,3.0,7/24/2014,"We arrived Tuesday night around 9pm, after being at Legoland, for a late dinner with the kids. Only had to wait a short amount of time to be seated. We asked for first available and was seated on the patio. Our waiter was busy so another waiter came by to take our drink and appetizer order. He returned with out drinks and checked back a few minutes later to ask if our waiter had come by to take our order. He hadn't, so this waiter took our order. A few minutes later our real waiter came by to check on us. We had already got our salad and drinks. I really liked that they worked as a team to get out order going so we didn't have to wait as long to order and to get our food.  We ordered the BBQ ranch chicken salad to start. It was good but I prefer the one at Cheesecake Factory better. This salad was mainly lettuce with small amounts of tomatoes, black beans, chicken, and topped with onion rings. The BBQ sauce was very sparse and the ranch was very light.  The salad wasn't very saucy in sections, kind of dry.  For our main dish we ordered the Deep Dish Sweet Pig.  It was delicious!  The dough was  very thick and crunchy. Great flavors. Tons of ham and pineapples.  Dessert we shared the Pizookie Trio. So sad that we could not get the Peanut butter s'mores with the trio, so we had to choose another flavor. We went with the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut, Triple Chocolate, and the Salted Caramel. The triple chocolate was by far my favorite.  I'm pretty sure they gave us a regular peanut butter instead of the salted caramel. It tasted peanut buttery and had no caramel.  The white chocolate macadamia nut is very sweet, especially compared to the Triple chocolate.  Overall, service was good except for our dessert mistake. I can't wait to come back and try the new s'mores pizookie.  I would have given them a 4 star except they made mistake on our dessert which was a bummer since we were excited to try the salted caramel.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=180

How could I judge a restaurant without ever having tried their featured dish, right?  Ok, so this time when a friend picked BJ's to meet for lunch, I ordered the mini pizza (my one topping was pepperoni) and salad lunch special.  Ok, so the pizza was great - buttery, rich, sinful, delicious. These guys aren't winning a James Beard award but the pizza was really good. But check it out - the house salad was weak weak weak. With this lunch special I could choose only the house, Caesar or wedge salads. I picked the house with ranch and received a lightly dressed medley with off the shelf iceberg lettuce, shredded carrot, croutons and tomato. Was fine but boring.  I'll go back.

Levy-Karen V.,"Oceanside, CA",57,9,11,1.0,5/27/2016,"Updated review. For starters even if you call ahead to make a reservation for a party you still wait more than 45 mins . We called ahead a time and made a reservation for our party and arrived at 0830 on the dot and were seated at 0927, no service just sitting there waiting nothing else. So after the long wait tried to forget about the wait since it was for a celebration and I ordered the beer sampler, fried calamari and the chicken bacon ranch Pantai. The beer sampler was great had a good selection to choose from and honestly it was enough for the night for me so worth it. The calamari was decent but they forgot to add one of the dips and lemons. I only bring this up because someone else in our party also ordered it and got it perfect with everything I had to ask the waiter to get just the other dip. Once the chicken bacon ranch Pantai came I was excited to try it and was immediately defensive when I saw just the 2 pieces of it and no fries. Again someone else ordered it as well and got the order with their fries and when I asked the server if my fries were coming in a separate plate or something he lied saying they ran out and were making more, he delivered the other Pantai right after that statement. Poor poor service, the food is okay to say the least dried and with Ordinary flavor nothing special. The best thing is the beer which is great to enjoy with friends besides that I highly do not recommend this place. Not trying to rag on this place for petty things but honestly when everyone else but you get their orders with no issues and you repeatedly get yours screwed up it begins to dawn on you and honestly make it seem your not an important or valued costumer. Safely stating I will never return here because of this poor service, beware.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=180

The food was equally disappointing. The calamari tasted off, the sirloin steak ordered medium rare was well done, the Capriese sandwich was really bad (we didn't eat it), the Octoberfest beer was boring and hoppy, and the Asian salad was bland. We sent the steak back and it took so long to bring the second steak that we had finished the other entries.

JULIANA, the nine year old daughter, had the KID's KRAFT MAC & CHEESE. keep in mind that this is one of her lunch staples at home. so poorly made, she ate two bites and made it clear we didn't need to bother boxing the lefetovers to take with us. her side, the POTATO WEDGES, were worse than KFC's -- i didn't think that was possible. WYATT, the seven year old son, decided on BJ's boneless PREMIUM WINGS. the ""wings"" were chicken mcnuggets, pre-cooked, heat-em-up and eat-em-up and tossed in something that barely passed for BBQ sauce -- nasty. next fundraiser i think i'm gonna just write the school a check and spare myself the abuse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=240

Hate giving out anything less than 3 stars, it's really gotta be a crap experience for me to not give at least three.  Went for lunch this Monday 10/12/15 around 12:45/1 pm with my parents. Was greeted by the hostess who was fine, got sat immediately- which is about THE ONLY perk of this lunch.  Our server was honestly, garbage. I used to serve; did it all through college.

He was hurried, rude, not knowledgeable of the menu, forgot things I had asked for and just generally seemed like he would've rather been anywhere else than at work. He didn't know anything about the beer selection, couldn't offer recommendations and rolled his eyes actually when my mom was ordering.  On top of the, ehm, ""stellar"" service, we got food that was beyond bland. Very unexciting. I don't know if it's because our amazing server decided to leave it under the warmer for 15 minutes or what but everything just tasted...stale. I got a half and half flat bread (California club and roasted vegetable goat cheese). The bread was lifeless. The ""goat cheese"" if you can call three tiny white balls literally the size of an eraser on my flatbread a goat cheese flatbread, then it totally lived up to its standards. It tasted like it had sat out for a week. My moms sandwich plate was loaded with shoe string fries that tasted old! Not salty, not warm, just gross. My dad was the only one who got anything worth while. The BJ's barbecue lunch platter which he enjoyed and it actually smelled like it had just been cooked so I'm sure that's why.

The only bread bowls and clam chowder I have had are at SF and Disney (and if you haven't had it here you haven't lived) so I wasn't impressed at all. The service like I said was very attentive.

So she ordered her chicken wings and all 5 of us were done with food & drink/no wings for friend...waved waitress down.  When asked about her order waitress looked at us like we were stupid and replied in a condescending tone as if we were in kindergarten ""It's coming"".....I whipped out my phone 7 minutes later out came the wings...

WOW!  Surprisingly rich flavors - butter, milk chocolate, a caramelization effect on the white chocolate part, and good quality ice cream raised this dessert up a notch from just a sweet thing at the end of a meal.  I was digging out the final bits stuck in the pan crevices!  This might be a more motivating ""let's go there for dessert"" item than creme brulee!

Jennifer D.,"Carlsbad, CA",93,172,69,2.0,6/23/2012,"I have been to this location a few times before but nothing stellar enough to yelp about. Our visit last night will probably be our last as it resulted in me complaining to the manager and I NEVER do that. We were seated promptly on the patio outside, it wasn't too crowded yet as it was only 5:30.  Our waiter came (I will keep his name private as to not embarrass him, but it rhymed with ""Lyle"" and started with a ""K"") and took our drink order, all nonalcoholic but one and all arriving 20 minutes later. As he took our order, he would repeat back the items we ordered and they were not correct. For example, I asked for potato skins, and he would say ""OK, and an order for fried artichokes?"". NO LYLE, that's not what I said. The potato skins were way over cooked. The calamari was OK.  The best was when our table was littered with dirty dishes and empty glasses because he hadn't come by to clear them or offer us a refill, and another server comes whipping out of the patio door with a pizza and says ""Um, can you move your stuff out of the way, this pizza is hot and heavy and I'm about to drop it.""  You know what, no, I can't.  How about you bring that pizza stand thingy and some plates before you come out here full speed with a pizza and threaten me. Lyle comes by now to check how everything is. Well, my husband hadn't been brought his dinner. Any restaurant knows you serve the entire table at the same time. This is when I call a manager over. He apologizes and offers to comp husbands dinner. When the check comes, no comp. So of course, that's another 5 minute wait and then another 10 minutes for him to run my credit card and then bring me the slip to sign...with no pen. Find a new job, Lyle. For a chain restaurant in a busy location (across from the company stores outlet), they need to make a better effort to hire competent waiters who can handle the vast menu and heavy flow of people. They line to get in was bananas when we left. Sorry to whomever got table 21 on the patio.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=300

The servers are usually happy so it helps with the ""happy"" hour. But here is my concern: Along with the beer and main course, I order the spinach and artichoke dip. There have been times where the dip could have been prepped better (luke warm temp), the ""appetizer"" came out at the same time with the pizzas, or the server completely forgets about the dip.

However, I have received VERY poor service the last two times I've been here and have not felt appreciated by management whatsoever when I've raised my concerns. I went here this past week to celebrate a friend's birthday and it took over 3 hours for us to receive our dinners. There was 6 of us, so not a huge group to accommodate. The drinks appetizers were brought out at different times (one by one it seemed). Half of the dinner orders were taken and the waiter did not come back for another half hour to take the rest of our orders.  The worst part of this experience was by far the treatment we received from the manager. Her attitude made us feel very unappreciated and the best she could offer us was to comp the cheapest item on every check (which came out to taking about 5 dollars off of our $40 bill).

My group of 7 adults + 1 baby waited about 15 minutes. Since we were all hungry, we perused the menu while waiting so we could order right away. Once seated, we started with calamari. Once we were done, the plates were cleared and it felt like we were forgotten about for awhile because it took forever to get our entrees. I went with a new dish, the Moroccan spiced salmon, and it was just ok. It smelled great, but I was disappointed by the portion size. For the price, I expected more food. Also, I had no spoon, but the dish was soupy because there was so much sauce, so it was hard to pick up the couscous. My bf went with the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatballs were the tastiest thing I tried all night. They had good spices and even had a bit of a kick. The noodles were bland. I would have liked hot sauce with both dishes but our server didn't come by to check on us for a long time.  My friends got pork chops, ahi tuna salad, fettuccine alfredo, hawaiian mahi mahi, and a house salad. Most of them were satisfied with their dishes, but the hawaiian mahi mahi was a disappointment because it was tiny. Hence, the side order of house salad. One neat thing about BJ's is they have a few handcrafted sodas. They weren't listed on the menu but one of my friends knew about it from a previous visit so she got a cherry coke (I think?) which I tried and it was pretty good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=380

Our friends had coordinated a buffet as well as a few deep dish pizzas for each table and everything was delicious.  The food has always been pretty consistent but to be honest, I've never really strayed from their appetizers, salads and pizzas and have never tried their pastas.  I'm usually not a big fan of deep dish pizzas but I am a fan of theirs. Their buttery crusts are just finger licking good and worth the calories and extra time spent at the gym.

William B.,"Oceanside, CA",22,260,137,4.0,6/16/2013,"2nd time we've been here and like before, the menu selection is big enough that it takes a bit of looking over, which maybe the waitress forgot when she came over a scarcely a moment after we were seated.  We needed a few moments and finally I got a sampler size of the berry burst cider (yummy!) and a vanilla creme soda.  Wife got the root beer and we agreed the sodas were quite good.  Got the artichoke and spinach dip which was creamy and mild tasting. Fish & chips I had were good; the fish pieces were of a good size and the skinny fries were done just right.  Wife had the Moroccan Spiced Salmon which looked nice, but tasted rather plain, despite the 9 spices it's supposed to be flavored with. Usually when we drive by, this place seems to be really busy but on at 1pm on a Friday, there was only a 2 minute wait which is fine by me.   Menu here seems to have pretty much something for everyone.   4 stars because while the food I had this time and the black and bleu burger I had last time were good, it's not good enough to be great.   Still worth coming back for though, especially since I see they have deep dish pizza here and short of going to San Diego for it, deep dish is hard to come by.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=380

Started promising enough, we sat in the bar area and were greated quickly. Everything went downhill from there. I don't expect much from BJs food. It's bar food, not much to screw up, food was totally fine as long as you don't expect much. Service was a disaster. My fiancé and I have worked in fine dining for years so I have a very high threshold for bad service. I get that everyone has an off night. The server was rude and barely acknowledged us, despite us acknowledging her every time she stopped by the table. Refilled waters quickly but waited forever for drinks, condiments, etc. Came over to ask if I wanted another glass of wine while my fiancé was still eating his meal, I did. Brought it and immediately dropped the check. She clearly wanted to sit with her friends that were off earlier and having drinks in the bar area.

We came in around 4:30 on a Saturday afternoon and there was only 1 party of two ahead of us. We had just came from Legoland so we were tired with our little one. There were tons of empty tables and lots of servers walking around but the 3 hostess said it would be like 15-20 minute wait. We saw there was 1 table sitting outside and we asked if we could sit down out there any faster and they said no. So we literally waited 20 minutes to sit down and watch the hostess gossip among each other than try to seat people.  Once we sat down we waited around for a really long time. I understand if there isn't servers available but when you see a large group of them standing around computers and not working their tables that can be a little frustrating.

Mama D.,"Oceanside, CA",1,98,8,3.0,11/11/2014,"Wow. It's Veterans Day, so I saved seating by sitting at the bar & the service couldn't have been more slack. Congratulations that Hooters kicked your butt today for politeness,  timeliness,  efficiency,  the list goes on. Not only did bartender Johnny confirm that swapping pasta for brown rice was okay, he said a half & half (lunch dish w/salad) would be cool (smaller portion of chicken lunch & small version of a wedge salad). Okay: DONE, or so I thought.  After awaiting any attention to sampling two beers--he pitches immediately upon my sitting,  I thought, ""hey, it's Veteran's Day--kinda busy"" to myself. Whatever. After multiple delays and just being flat up ignored (the 2nd beer taster, my box later)...I was just over it. 'Peista resistance': the fact that I was not only charged for my FREE lunch (yes, I flashed my ID right away), I'd been UP-CHARGED. Seriously?  Because it's not uncomfortable enough to have to mention he screwed up, he charges me MORE?  I alerted him to this faux pas, and he makes me wait (again) a really long time & takes other orders,  and more while I'm waiting for the remedy. Okay, now you're just being a jerk & I'm seething at this treatment ON VETERANS DAY. After attempting to flag him down for a (leftover) box,  I gave up & asked the other bartender.  I hated to bug him, he had other folks to attend to, yet didn't have much choice. As it was, I had to remind him too. But at least he brought it.  By now, Johnny STILL had not come over to explain that had he adjusted the bill.  Idk, I'm thinking 15 minutes after pulling 'that',  you're just not great service staff.  I decided there's no way I can't tell a manager. I write a note on my bill (that this guy took no time whatsoever in sticking in a rock glass in front of me) stating a GM should call me ASAP bcs they're getting Yelped. Did I mention the two young,  male GIs next to me had proper bills & didn't have to ask for correction?  Yeah. And the interesting fellow drawing Batman on his digital tablet next to me--Johnny had time to look at his other drawings to where the guy offered him, ""wanna see my son?"" Lordy. Helloooo, customers waiting--aisle five. And this bartender also explained to someone who queried why it was so busy, ""it's the free meals for veterans"". Wow, jackaxx: a) you're welcome, b) sorry WE have inconvenienced you. Manager Anthony followed me out to see what happened. I told him the whole situ & how I   $$ in the rock glass & asked if he approach me based on the note passed to a waitress. I let Anthony know that if my note didn't surface,  they have a 'bigger issue'.  Anthony was great, and most the staff was on their game, yet this isn't the kind of thing you can 'gift card' away.

Our waitress comes to take our order for drinks, and at that time were ready to put in our food order too. I was still giving this place the benefit of the doubt with it being busy,  and  our waitress being overwhelmed with other tables. I ordered the bacon guacamole deluxe burger, my mother in law had a tortilla soup. A guy server came by to drop her soup off. He asked if she wanted lemon in her soup before she could say no he already started adding it in the bowl. He touched her food and took it out.  I've never seen something like this. It's not sanitary or professional in my opinion.  He then dropped her spoon down in a rude manner. Once the rest of the food came out I asked the waitress for some ranch. When I finally got it i was practically done with my food and didn't need it anymore. The burger itself was good nothing special, the fries weren't even hot. My drink wasn't refilled and she didn't come and check on us or apolozie or anything. At this point were ready to leave. Presented credit card faced up in the black book so she could see it,  5 minutes later it's picked up. Night times are not their specialty, last year was the last time we were here.

Charles S.,"Oceanside, CA",31,57,2,2.0,8/30/2012,"Last Saturday, my wife's family came down to visit and requested to go somewhere very nice for dinner. My first instinct was to make reservations at Pacific 333; however, when I called at 5pm they told me that 8 pm was the earliest I could get our party of 7 in. With relatives still on the road at an ETA of around 6:30 pm, I called BJ's and made a reservation for 7 at 7pm. When someone answered the phone with ""whats up"" I should have just hung up. I asked if she could take my reservation and she said ""yes"", and then started telling me about some call ahead policy that they have. Apparently, they will take your reservation but you must call ahead 30 min early? I told her we would be there at 7, and I did not want to call ahead. She said that would be fine. I was happy that I found a place to eat on a Saturday night with such a large party and at 6:30 we all loaded up and drove down to Carlsbad. When I got there the hostess informed me that because I did not call 30 min early, we would have to wait 30 min. As I stood there holding my 5 wk old baby's car seat, I could feel my wife's family's anger. ""Why didn't we just go to Pacific 333 if we were going to have to wait?"" Finally, they all insisted that I go speak with the manager.  As I started speaking with the hostess and manager I noticed that my reservation was in fact noted.... on a napkin! The manager told me it would be less than 5 minutes and we would have the next table. And we did.  Overall, the food was decent and the beer was good. The manager handled the situation well. I know they were busy and we were a difficult goup to handle, but I just have such an angry feeling towards the whole situation that 2 stars is all I can give.

I don't know why this irritated me but maybe it's because it just didn't make sense. I go to my local Bj's (in another area) almost 1-2 times per month, never have they refused call ahead. Ok, next mistake.. I asked about the 2 for $20 deal. Bj's glorious deal that makes me love them that much more when they come back with this offer every few months. She said they don't offer this either at this particular location. Even after I asked her ""are you sure about that because I saw it on the website.."" she quickly reassured me (without even confirming with anyone around her or a manager) that they don't do that at this particular Bj's.  If your nation-wide website says you have something & you ""supposedly don't"" then you're probably not up to the Bj's standard. =( Anyways, we arrive, put our names down and given a 20 minute wait time..(I wonder if this is still ""too busy"" for call ahead... ) Then their system crashes and they go around with pen & paper to make another waiting list. Accidents happen and working in the service industry myself I understand that technology sucks sometimes... However,  there are 3-4 hostesses, it took them a while to get their act together, no sign of management....and they finally seat us 45 minutes later. Even after all this, they didn't apologize once to us... Our waiter quickly rectified all mistakes aforementioned by saying that the deal was still on til the 29th and he was VERY CONFUSED as to why we were told otherwise. He went to the hostesses desk and actually ASKED them if they knew that we were doing this deal.  Anyways, he made it better and it was all good.  But i still wouldn't revisit this location. i hope management finds this review and does some serious phone etiquette training & conveys the message to all of its employees",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=420

Andy C.,"Carlsbad, CA",193,1233,3341,5.0,1/24/2010,"I can finally be public about my love for BJs. A new location has finally opened in the North County San Diego area located right across the street from the Carlsbad Premium Outlet Mall and Car Country Carlsbad. This location is one of two in the North County area. The second will be in at the Escondido North County Fair Mall, but that location is still under construction. I still can't believe it....2 BJs that I can have some easy access too!! My friends and I were sitting around the house one day when, I got a craving to have a pizookie. We knew of only one place to get our pizookies served to us. We got in the car, and pulled into. Three hungry men came into the place, and we wanted our needs met. First we decided that we couldn't get our pizookie's until we had dinner first. (You can't go to BJs and not get some treats before your dessert.) So we ordered a Cobb Salad, a Medium Spinach & Artichoke Pizza, and a bowl of Chili. The Cobb Salad is made to perfection. The chefs in the back put in chopped romaine and iceberg lettuce and is tossed in a creamy garlic dressing, which is super delicious. On top of the salad is roasted turkey, Applewood smoked bacon, feta cheese, tomatoes, avocado, and croutons. The Spinach and Artichoke PIzza was baked and delicious too! This wonderful deep dish pizza serves a good 3 people. This pizza is has a rich, creamy medley of spinach, artichoke hearts, cream cheese and mozzarella topped with a fresh tomato basil blend and Parmesan cheese. A MUST GET WHEN YOU COME HERE!!! The chili here is also delicious!!! Don't be surprised when you place this into your mouth and taste beer, because it is made with some ale. It's even in the name on the menu! The chili is made with select cuts of tender pork and beef, pinto beans and Piranha Pale Ale. The chili is topped with melted jack and cheddar cheeses, sour cream and green onions. Also, this can be served in a cup, bowl or a bread bowl. Lastly, you can't leave without getting a pizookie. A warm delicious cookie served in a pizza pan and freshly baked, hot out of the oven, rich and delicious cookie topped with two scoops of vanilla bean ice cream. You can also get your choice of Chocolate Chunk, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut, Peanut Butter or Oatmeal Raisin Walnut. This location has curb side pick-up, online ordering, and weekend brunch. If you ever want to come here and get a good serving from BJs, then call me cause you are never to old to get some BJs!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=420

All of my visits at BJ's have been great and I plan on making a few trips back. I never waste my time ordering a ""non-pizza"" entree because I would rather go to a place that only serves such a thing. I don't visit a Brewhouse for Italian food. I started with a Calamari appetizer and to my surprise was very meaty unlike most places that go overboard on the bread. There was not a bite without a good chunk of squid. The sauce provided with the appetizer added some good variety in flavor and even had a little kick to it. I ordered a buffalo chicken pizza that came with some expected spice but proved for an interesting combination in a pizza. This pizza comes with some hickory-smoked BBQ sauce, red onions, seasoned tomatoes, cilantro and BBQ chicken breast. It works out nice if you are trying to change it up from the standard ""meat lovers"" or ""Hawaiian"" combinations. With my pizza I tried a sample of the Magnolia's Peach brew and had to order a pint. It's the craft brew flavor you're used to with a subtle flavor infused. It was NOT the run-of-the-mill ""Kool Aid"" style that's often served elsewhere. My wife ordered the Mediterranean pizza has a very soft initial flavor and rich aftertaste. This pizza come with grilled chicken, basil pesto, roasted garlic, Kalamata olives, sun-dried tomatoes, feta cheese and sliced peperoncinis. I had to snag a bite because it looked and smelt so good.

I came of age and started drinking beer and loved their hand crafter micro brews, still the pizza was good and so was the root beer and I really got into trying most of their menu, now I started going to the Laguna locations and I still liked it a bunch. A few years later I'm back in SD and now I've been around long enough to know the difference between good and bad service, not just in waiting times. I love BJ's and often have business consults with new and prospective clients here and every time I keep noticing the service is like a thorn in my side.

The server was attentive and let us know it was happy hour which got us $2 off appetizers and 50% off any mini pizza. We had no trouble flagging her down and getting anything we needed.  My husband enjoyed his cream soda. I had a wonderfully refreshing Berry Burst Hard Cider.  Our appetizer, the Ahi Poke was phenomenal. The avocado was so creamy it was like an orgasm I'm my mouth when mixed with the tuna. The won-ton chips were perfectly seasoned and the tuna was firm and yet melted in your mouth.  I then tried the Gourmet Mac n Cheese. The flavor was fantastic. The chipotle spice and garlic was great and the bacon was super crisp, a wonderful balance to the very liquid sauce. Normally I like my Mac n cheese with a thicker sauce but this still gets an A in my book. I think the cheddar cracker crumbs on top won me over.  Then, we got two mini pizzas. The Southwest Chicken and the BJ's Favorite. They were absolutely fantastic. The dough was crispy on the outside, and tasted a lot like a Pizza Hut deep dish, but it was fantastic none the less. Both are excellent.  We also couldn't decide on which Pazookie to do, so we went with the Trio. Oreo was fantastic, I just wish they had put more of the 'cream' in with it. That was bomb! Peanut butter cookie was fantastic with real peanuts in it, and my favorite was the chocolate chip. It was still soft and gooey and I'm pretty sure there is a huge party in my tummy.

When you order them to go, they are stuffed into the box and into an oven until you arrive, leave and eat. It works, but the pizza dough keeps cooking and dries out... it still is good pizza, but not the amazing experience of fresh pizza.

This includes 2 bowls of soup or salad, a medium pizza (upgrade to large for about $3) and a pizookie of your choice! This deal easily feeds 3-4 people. The pizza here is the best, they have many flavors and you can get two different kinds on one pizza. My favorite part of the pizza is the thick crust. The reason BJ's is famous is for their pizookies, which are delicious oven baked cookies with ice cream on top. My favorite pizookie is the cookies and cream one!

I was rather confused and asked and she said they just must of made the wrong size. Then it was time for the check and she charged me for the small pizza. Which I only ate one slice of anyway, no one was sharing the pizza with me. So I asked her about it and she kind of got attitude and said I ordered a small telling me she was right and I was wrong.  So everyone at my table heard me say personal size, so the manager came and apologized and took care of the situation.  After that I did decide to go back on other occasions and the service has been good, the food is usually always good.  So, never let you're first bad experience be your only experience.

To my heart dismay the burger that I thought sounded absolutely amazing turned on to lower my expectations of Bj's and makes me think they should just stick to pizza. The burger to begin with was very dry. I ordered it Medium/well. the meat did't taste of good quality. It tasted burnt a little bit, but it was cooked the way i wanted on the inside. Just maybe cooked to fast on the outside. There was maybe one jalapeno on the burger, and there was nothing crispy about it.

I have been to fine dining places and never have been treated as i was treated here. Jennifer was our waitress and she was on it. I thought it and without asking she delivered. I could not believe it. The food was great I had ordered ahi salad and a pizza. The ahi salad was crispy and the ahi had a great taste. The pizza had just the right amount of sauce and toppings on it. The dough was crispy but not hard and not too chewy in the middle. i would get down to 1/3 of my drink and before I could look up to find Jennifer she was already on her way over to fill my drink. I have gone places (not going to mention any names....Jays Gormet)  that i had waited 20 minutes to get a water. I was so impressed by this waitress I asked her to send her manager over. She looked at me so puzzled, didnt argue just went and got him. When they both came back, she started walking away I stopped her and asked her to come back. She looked so stressed. I started telling the manager how impressed I was and this is by far the best service I have ever received. I continued on and on (so did the rest of my party) by the time we were done she was smiling from ear to ear. We left her a 50% tip.  Here is the bad news....

Rayan B.,"Escondido, CA",86,38,4,4.0,7/3/2010,"Pros: Great tasting Pizza, decent service Cons: Their way of making you wait was a turn off It's a Friday night and fairly obvious that whatever restaurant we visit will be pretty packed.  We called in at 8:20pm on a Friday night to seat a party of 3 (and definitely expected it to be busy, like usual).  The guy over the phone told me it's a 45 minute wait; however, he did mention calling in advance cuts the time down to 15 minutes.  Perfect!  We're right next door! After getting there 10 minutes later, they told me it'll be another 10 minutes.  Ok, that sounds about right... but it turns out we waited 45 minutes instead!  Not sure if that's their strategy to get us in the door... it did work, but it did irritate us just a bit.  We were talking about possibly eating some place else since we knew it would be a while til we got our pizza anyway, but we stuck with the plans and proceeded to our table. The service from then on was outstanding.  Our server was able to get our drinks quickly and take our order.  I got a little skeptical about the Bacon Cheeseburger Pizza, but take my word: you'll love it!  We didn't get our food til 40 minutes later (but time goes by when you have good buddies tagging along!) We were done and finished with our food by 10:40pm... so definitely expect your dining experience to be roughly 2 hours by the time you walk into the door.  Just grab a beer and have a good time with your pals, and you'll be fine with this place :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=520

So, I felt compelled to let the waitress (very nice) know I ordered the ""sandwich"" and could i just have the ""sandwich"" price.

I was so excited to see the pot roast ""sandwich"" in all it's glory.....but seriously it's the same meal with bread next to it. Also, the replacement meal came with raw vegetables which was kinda interesting next to the piping hot roast.  OK, whatever MISSION ACCOMPLISHED the GLORIOUS BREAD!!!  Until I learned later the bread (crazy stale) took a tiny bread time machine 'from the distant past' and jumped on my plate...it was VERY unwelcomed!  Stale bread and raw veggies...

We arrived at 4:30 and there was no wait to be seated.  We went inside with our two small children and sat and waited.  And waited.  And waited.  And waited.   We tried to make eye contact with several servers but they were all too absorbed with chatting or singing or whatever else they were doing to even walk by.  After over 20 minutes of waiting and waiting and waiting my husband said they had 5 minutes or we were leaving.  5 minutes passed and then we packed up the children and prepared to leave.  At that moment a server came by and asked if we had been helped.  We said no.  He apologized and asked if he could get us anything.  At this point my husband said no and explained that we had been waiting for close to 30 minutes and we were done. You need to realize that when my husband makes up his mind, he makes it up for good.  He holds his grudges near to his heart and doesn't let them go easily.  And when he says he will not be going back to an establishment, he means it.  The waiter offered to get us a manager but after 30 minutes it was just too much.  We walked out hungry and thirsty.  We didn't even have as much as a glass of water to drink.  A manager followed us to our car but after an experience that bad it's just too little too late.  I'm actually quite sad - we had great experiences in Escondido but my husband is beyond stubborn so I guess I need to cross this off my list of favorite places to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=540

Finally the food was brought to the table and my dish looked picture perfect!  And ... it was delicious!  I was soooo pleased with this dinner; it was well prepared, everything was hot and fresh-tasting & the chicken was cooked perfectly!!!  The mashed potatoes were fabulous and the broccoli was just typical - could have used a little butter instead of being just steamed.  This is definitely a ""go to"" dinner that I will order again.  My DH liked his dish - the chicken breast was very moist, but the pasta was a little too thick &  narrow and slightly a little too undercooked - needed another 30 seconds.  He definitely would order MY dish on our next visit, he said. Yes, service is slow - the place is just too big; they probably need more servers or cooks - one or the other.  Had to wait again for the check. But food was very tasty and the pricing of around $12-something each was very fair.  I'm glad we tried it a second time.  We will return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=540

My favorites on the menu are the Gourmet Mac  & Cheese, the Wings, and the Chicken Parmigiana.   A word of warning to one of the steaks and the Black and Bleu burger, their bleu cheese is almost disgustingly sharp and unpleasant.  I don't drink beer but I got my father to go here and he loved all the different beers they had on tap that was the restaurants own crafts.  The only down sides to this restaurant is that  1) your waiter can be a hit or miss. Sometimes they're nice and other times they're rude.  2) I've had certain food items like the ribs, be out of stock, or whatever they call it, twice before. Both times, the waiter didn't come out and tell me till after waiting for 10 minutes. 3)The parking lot is somewhat tight and can get packed very easily. 4)It gets very loud in here and although they have maybe 10 flatscreens up in there, usually it's only sports and more than once, it was the same game on every single tv.

Jill P.,"Vista, CA",37,22,,4.0,8/8/2011,"I have been frequenting BJ's since I moved to California in 1987.  Back in the olden days, my family would have to travel an hour to Laguna Beach to enjoy the tasty goodness.  I'm not sure if it was the location (directly across from the beach), the saltwater smell that had soaked into the wood furnishings or the fact that we came from a small Midwestern town, but we thought BJ's was the best thing on Earth! Fast forward to present day and BJ's are popping up all over the place.  And now there is one 15 minutes away from me.   My mom and I had been out running errands yesterday and I suggested lunch here.  Their menu is now huge, a definite change from the days of only pizza, salad and garlic bread. And they brew their own beer too. If you want a refreshing beer on a hot, summer day, try the Jerry Burst.  It's a combination of their Jeremiah Red and the Berry Burst.  Actually, it doesn't need to be a hot, summer day for one to enjoy this, it works all year 'round.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  Too bad it's only 9:00 am.   They now have flatbread pizzas on their menu so we paired the Margherita Fresca with a wedge salad and had at...The wedge is a wedge, you can't really go wrong with it...although I will have to remember to order the dressing on the side next time.  The flatbread was great, the crust was perfectly crunchy.   Our server was friendly and on top of it.  As much as I wanted to indulge in their yumminess that is a pizookie, we decided against it.  I'm not going to the gym for nothing!  If you have never had one, might I suggest the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut?  Unless of course you have nut allergies.  Then stay far away.   My only problem is recently they started to place a separate menu on the table that had the calorie content in it...I always politely handed it back and said ""no thank you""...But now, the calorie content is listed right next to the menu item.  Ugh.  I'm sure some people like that, but I don't.  I will have to train my eyes to not look at it.  Oh the music!  I was a fan of every song I heard. There was a great mix of RHCP, The Who, Green Day, Cee Lo Green and Kim Carnes wafting throughout.  A little something for everyone.

As we walk in, we're finally greeted by an employee and we explain our situation that we were put on hold and no one ever picked up.  No apology.  This individual went ahead and took our order (Ryan - from the receipt).  While waiting for our order (10-12 minutes), I noticed the restaurant wasn't busy, so I found it odd for the lack of attention.  Also during our wait, someone called the take out line and the hostess answered again, putting whomever on hold.  The same individual (Ryan) picked up the phone and based on what I could hear (i.e. loud enough for anyone to hear), it was a personal call.  So if someone else had been trying to place an order, would they have gotten through?  Made me wonder if this was why we were on hold for so long.  Extremely poor customer service.  Don't think I'll bother calling in an order here....as my wife mentioned she had to wait an extremely long time in the past also.  It might be better to drive up a bit and give Bistro West or Hensley's our business....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=600

Mary H.,"Oceanside, CA",1,28,,1.0,1/26/2013,"After reading some of these reviews, I have to think if we are talking about the same restaurant. I know that sometimes it is just a bad day etc. and sometimes it should be brought up with management so they can make it right that same day. So with that being said I was just there today sat 1/23/13. So maybe management will address what they can if they see this and they should. My husband will not let me send any food back and hates if I complain.  We started out there today early got there around 11:45 am and it was not busy and got seated right away. Our server was ok, I ordered a glass of chardonnay and got interrupted by my granddaughter and forgot to mention was type. Server brought me the Barefoot house wine and I sent it back, I told him in a nice way it is always better to ask than to assume and of course to up sell :) He was nice about it and we joked that I may have looked like a Barefoot wine girl, but I like Kendall Jackson.   Anyways on to the food....the reason why we are there right???? Our food was so bad that my husband finally admitted it when we got home later today and we will never, ever go back.  I got sick from my food and missed most of Disney on Ice and my husband also got tummy ache, but not as bad as mine if you know what I mean.  I had a quarter of his burger and it was cold and just not good. It tasted like they did not clean the grill in a while and was kind of a rancid taste, which in my opinion what caused the stomach issues.  We also ordered the avocado rolls and they were also cold and just not good, no flavor!!!! French fries were also cold and horrible skinny tasteless things.  The manager of this restaurants needs to address the old food on the grill issue because that is the same as leaving food out and that is what causes food borne illnesses.  The kitchen staff should be talked to and opening management needs to check on this and make sure they don't have a case of the lazy's and getting people sick.   This may seem harsh and one should not rush to judge, but I have worked in restaurants long enough to know that if the entire order is cold and two people get sick then there is probably more people having the same issue with this establishment and management needs to address this right away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=620

Anna D.,"Chicago, IL",78,147,24,4.0,12/26/2009,"First and foremost, I usually don't review chain restaurants.  I always feel there are enough reviews of them and I feel I can add more value reviewing the small businesses.  However, every now and then, I'll encounter an establishment that is deserving of a few comments.   I was debating whether to give this place 4 or 5 stars.  I have no complaints about this place and the food/beer were good, but I'm a tough grader and even tougher on chains, so here you go...I am in deed, a fan.     They brew their own beer at this place and I'm sure you'll find a favorite in one of them.  They have a 4 taste sampler under $6 and a 7 sampler for $10.  We tried the four taste sampler: - Bavarian Hefeweizen (fruity, spicy and refreshing), it was my favorite.  - American Piranha Pale Ale  - Irish Strong Ale - Imperial Stout (sweet, bitter roasted, and complex taste), goes well with Ribs. Food: The calamari appetizer was delicious!!!  It was one of my favorite calamaris I've had and I ALWAYS get the calamari everywhere I go.  They have great batter, making the skin crispy while the calamari had a soft, crunch to it.  For our main meal, we had the cajun pasta ($1.00 off  if you get the lunch special, plus they throw in a soup or salad for you).  The California burger was delicious but wished they would have cooked to order (they didn't ask).  Their menu is as large as a Cheesecake Factory menu.  Their drinks menu alone runs at least 4-5 pages.  Enjoy reading!    Overall, we had great customer service.  We went on a Saturday afternoon and decided to sit in the bar area (which also has booths) and did not need to wait long.  We give it an A on every level.  Next time you need some grub while shopping at the Carlsbad outlet, be sure to make a stop here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=580

The ice creams are vanilla and chocolate. I am absolutely positutely sure that any combination of cookie and ice cream is ridiculously good! In case you're wondering, yes I did eat my dinner first.  I had the grilled chicken club sandwich with wedgie fries.  The sandwich was good, great value with fresh ingredients.  I did only eat half of the sandwich, in hopes of having dessert.  The other half was still good when I toasted and ate it the next day for lunch. Service from our two waiters was ok. I say just ok because I had asked the female waitress for more hot water, she forgot so I asked the guy for more hot water and a take-out box. He brought the hot water but forgot the box.

Rachel S.,"Brisbane, Australia",305,192,253,2.0,3/22/2012,"I feel like the concept of this place is more appreciated than the food and service. Yes, the bar is trendy and open til 1am on some nights and the building is huge with high ceilings and decorated walls, but the food is just average and the service is nothing special. I went to BJ's to celebrate Valentines day with my boyfriend, I ordered a pasta dish which was supposed to come in a creamy marinara/alfredo sauce, sounds good but I can't have dairy so I asked for just plain marinara and even explained that I really can't have dairy and the waitress seemed confident that they could help me out with that.  Of course, my pasta comes out, in a creamy orange sauce. I didn't eat until the waitress came back and I showed her my pasta, she first said ""Are you sure this is creamy?"" and then she was like ""Oh yea it is, sorry about that"" and took it back for me which was nice.  Honestly the wait wasn't worth it, the pasta was average and I could make it at home, overcooked noodles are my specialty. My boyfriend did love the Jumbalaya he ordered though! Also, we ordered the Chicken Lettuce Wraps as an appetizer, which were VERY good, but we paid about $10 for a TINY bowl of the chicken which barely fed just the two of us. More recently, my family and I came to BJ's to show our relatives from out-of-town what this place was like (they love Cheesecake factory so this was the closest thing to it). The service was HORRIBLE. There were 8 of us and each couple ordered an appetizer, so we had about 6 appetizers ordered, the appetizers came out right when the main courses did which left us with literally no room and confusion on what to eat. We let the waiter know that we were not happy with that, so the manager came to our table and told us we didn't have to pay for the appetizers, which was really nice! One of the main courses, didn't come out at all, so my poor grandma had to sit and wait for her fish and chips to make their way to the table. When the bill came, we were charged automatically for the gratuity because we had 8 people, which they didn't deserve. My brother-in-law wanted to pay for his meal seperately which was fine, but when they brought him his reciept, they over-charged him by $6 AND charged him the automatic gratuity! Which made no sense because he was paying for only his meal and my sisters, which equals 2 people BJ's! TWO!!  We left pretty unhappy, my dad swears he'll never go there again.

Parris B.,"Carlsbad, CA",15,115,11,3.0,3/16/2010,"I love their deep dish pizza.  Floor could've been swept and the tables could be slightly cleaner in this pizza palace. I ordered the Mac 'n Cheese Snack and the Classic Deep Dish.  The mac and cheese had a sophisticated taste and was topped with bread crumbs for a good texture lift.  Bacon bits were dispersed throughout the dish and it only cost 3 or 4 bucks. The pie crust was slightly flaky, with buttery overtones.  It was topped with pepperoni, sausage, mushroom, and chunks of tomato, and I was in heaven. The kids menu is very reasonably priced, my little boy loved the pizza as well and my older son enjoyed his grilled cheese.  Kid's desserts were priced at .95 for a sundae and 1.95 for a pizookie. The missus ordered the flatbread pizza.  The thin crusted pie (prosciutto and artichoke?) was a bit rich for her and she could only eat 2 small pieces. We ordered the apple crisp and root beer float for dessert.  The apple crisp wasn't too crisp, I usually like a nice butter and brown sugar crust, but it seemed to be dominated by oats.  The root beer float was delicious, as all root beer floats are.  BJ's has a custom brewed root beer. The wait was 10 minutes at 5 pm on Sunday evening, and it only got worse as the hours passed.  This restaurant gets a lot of traffic and I would avoid it at peak hours.  My beer took about 12 minutes to be served because they ran out of glasses. I expected the restaurant to be cleaner.  Underneath our table were remnants from the day: pepperoni, corners of sugar packets, crumbs.  The lamp shade at our table was covered with dust.  I'm not O.C.D., but it did detract from my dining experience.

Bob K.,"San Diego, CA",1,114,1,2.0,6/15/2010,"Here for a business lunch it was my first time at a BJ's Brewhouse. It was quite busy at noon time but we were quickly seated. The menus had a good selection tasty sounding selections at a acceptable price. The interior brick decor was reminiscent of an old brewery and well laid out with plenty of space between tables. There were large screen televisions strategically spaced throughout the dining area and there was classic rock playing, at a reasonable level, in the background.  I feel obligated to comment on the linen(?) napkins... they provided these, quite nice looking, blue cloth napkins. Though I can't say for sure what they are made from, but my guess is tent canvas. Those suckers were rough and stiff! I've used mechanic rags that were MUCH more pliable then those provided. Regrettably, they didn't have any paper napkins as back-ups. Our group ordered two large deep-dish pizzas, the Great White, and a made-to-order sausage & pepperoni. About 10 minutes after ordering the waitress came back and told us that they were all out of the Alfredo sauce used in the Great White and we would have to reorder. Out at 12:30 in the afternoon during a prime meal time? Not good.  With regret we reordered the Southwestern pizza. Because of the time gap in our order/re-order we didn't get both pizzas at the same time. We had the first pizza gone well before the second one arrived. The sausage & pepperoni was pretty good and I found the Southwestern boring. The waitress came back pretty regular to refill the glasses of those drinking ice tea (we all had to go back to work) but she didn't once ask if I'd like my water refilled. The restroom was large and cleaner than most restaurant bathrooms. Overall, the pizza was acceptable but nothing to get excited about and the unavailability of menu items sure didn't help.

Then there is the food, which obviously is better than anything I can make at home, but still very similar to any other corporate restaurant.  They all buy their food from the same food distributors (U.S. Foods or Cisco) so everything ends up tasting relatively similar.  By the time you get the bill, you'll wish you had just gone to Jack in the Box (better burgers and fries for half the price) Do yourself a favor, stay away from corporate restaurants.  Chains are fine, but these large corporations are just so monotonous and trite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=580

Marina S.,"Burbank, CA",149,228,124,4.0,4/8/2011,"BJ's is hard to review because: a) they're EVERYWHERE - and it's hard to decide if you're going to review the service etc OR b) the food, which *should* be the same at every BJ's. I'll try and do both.  We came on our lunch break and for 3 of us we went all out and got a medium BBQ Pizza, a Chocolate Chunk Pizookie, and a BBQ Chicken Salad... yeah, I know, we kind of over BBQ'd ourselves.  Funny thing - we asked for all 3 things to be brought out together to make sure we'd get back to the office on time, and the Pizookie came out first! For those of you that have never had a PIZOOKIE (my friend had her first one this visit!!): It is a gooey ooey chocolatey cookie baked into a deep-dish pizza pan, with 2 huge servings of vanilla ice cream melting in the middle.  It is the perfect dessert to share, and as my husband always likes to say, you need to ""massage your veins afterward to keep your blood pumping - it's a heart attack waiting to happen!"" It's delish. They ended up accidentally making a large pizza, and gave it to us anyways, at the price of a Medium which was great.  I never WANT to go to BJ's because I prefer not to go to chains, and I prefer more ethnic varieties of foods when I eat out, but I have to say - BJ's NEVER DISAPPOINTS!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=500

Sean D.,"Carlsbad, CA",10,17,,2.0,8/24/2010,"I love the food here.  Good selection of great comfort food and something for everybody.  However, I have been to this particular restaurant about 10 times now, and the service is reliably sub-par.  At first I just figured the staff was new (because the restaurant was new) and they needed some time to get organized.  But I can't just give them a pass anymore.   After waiting to sit down (not their fault, it's a popular place) you wait forever for anyone to come up to you.  4 out of 10 times, I actually had to walk back up to the front to request a server come by.  After waiting a good 10-15min for someone to come by, you naturally start looking around for someone.  It's then you notice that the wait staff will not make eye contact.  That leads me to believe they know there's a problem and it's a consistent one.  My order is only occasionally right.  It's gotten to a point where I just keep things simple because I know they can't handle complicated requests like ""no tomato please"". Service is slow and disconnected.  Food is slow and usually wrong.  And getting the check requires firing a flare in the restaurant to let them know you're ready to leave.  Most places with bad service at least get the money part right. It's good food, especially the pizza and Pizookie.  But manage your expectations if you go (at any time of day).  My suggestion is- get it to go, or sit at the bar.  I have had marginally better success at the bar tables.

A L.,"Oceanside, CA",142,53,44,3.0,11/11/2010,"Driving up, I was in awe of how enormous the building is. It looks like the size of a 3 level department store. The parking lot was equally large and packed. There were very few spots available and for a Monday night, that was surprising. The restaurant was one large room broken down into a bar, and then the dining area separated by booths. It was filled to the brim with eager diners. There was even a wait. Again, this was surprising for me because we have been to so many restaurants on a Monday night and we have never had any trouble with reserving a table, parking (well, at Tomiko it was pretty bad), and finding a spot at the bar. Only time will tell if they can keep that up. We both ordered a BJ's brew. She started with the Pumpkin Ale and I started with the Jeremiah Red. I haven't had a red in years, but this brew was very enjoyable, smooth not bitter. ( Maybe in the years to come, I can become more of a beer connoisseur, but for now, please deal with my lay-mans terms of the taste and quality that I experienced. ) The Pumpkin Ale was perfect for this time of year. It had the perfect amount of flavor that instead of overpowering the light ale, complimented it nicely. One of the kind gentlemen who gave up his seat for us ordered some Calamari off of the appetizer menu. After a brief conversation about The bUZZ, he was eager to let me try a bite. He didn't know who he was messing with. I normally love Calamari. I was under the impression that you couldn't screw it up. Boy was I wrong. The one and only bite that was taken was pure oil. I saw the tiny, little squid, but there was no taste of it. . . anywhere. Yes, I made this opinion known and saw the man quickly return the plate of ""food"". After apologizing for ruining his meal, he agreed that yes, I had done that, but my comments were true. There was no denying the overpowering taste of oil. He moved onto the Chicken Wraps, which turned out to be much better. If you've been to P.F. Changs, you won't be disappointed with what BJ's offers. Surrounding the bowl of chicken was the lettuce, a thin mustard sauce, as well as sauce mainly used with soy sauce. Very neat looking and made for easy eating. We were all happy I liked it. Right around 7, my handy ""table is ready"" vibrator went off. That is when we met up with the rest of the gals. The restaurant was still pretty busy and loud, but not enough to bother us. It was lively and fun and got us all in the mood to try some of their special brews, spinach dip, salad, and a large pizza. It ended up being the perfect amount of food. One of the gals noticed the nutritional guide. Our waiter was quick to find out that it was missing a crucial piece of information: the serving size. He was kind enough to go find us that necessary tid-bit before we ordered the very creamy spinach dip. It turns out that the entire dip has 492 calories, minus the chips. It was good, just not as good as mine. While we were waiting for the rest of our meal, we ordered the beer sampler. Here are some of my quick thoughts:  The Blonde - more flavor than a corona, yet still very light. The Pitagna Pale Ale - Very smooth with a grapefruit flavor - much like a Stella The Jeremiah Red - This is the one the table gravitated to the most. Very smooth for a darker beer. The Brewnette - coffee like, strong Tatonka Stout - This is the Guiness-like beer. We all HATED it. The Pumpkin Ale - We all loved the spice and agreed it was only for the holiday season. Please forgive my notes and my memory as I left out any comment on the pizza that night. I do remember it was a deep dish and that everyone else was ""Mmmmming"" and I was like ""eh"". You would think that would pretty much round up our evening, but for 3 of us it wasn't over until 2 days later. I don't know if it was the side of the table we were sitting on or the way we looked at each other. But for us lucky 3, we woke up with severe stomach pains that couldn't let us get over the night before. It's very strange how only half of the group got sick, but it happened.

Annalee S.,"Vista, CA",5,9,,3.0,4/30/2010,"I came to BJ's for my dear friend's 1st 29th Birthday Party! They have a wide array of food from deep dish pizzas, pastas, sandwiches, stuffed potatoes, salads, and burgers and who can forget my favorite part of every meal DESSERT, my biggest weakness! Plus, they offer a good selection of beer and mixed spirits.=)  Atmosphere is good but a bit on the loud side and the service was pretty good considering there were 20 people at my friend's party. Having been here before, I ordered the California Chicken Sandwich for the second time knowing it was delicious the first time around. Its basically grilled chicken breast with green chiles, pepper jack cheese, ranch dressing, chipotle mayonaise, and fresh avocados on sourdough bread with a side of wedge cut seasoned fries. The chicken was a bit overcooked and dry to the point it should've been called the California ""Blackened"" Chicken and the bread was pretty soggy. Well the bottom part of the bread anyway.   I usually order the famous Pizookie which is a baked cookie (varieties range from Peanut Butter, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut, Chocolate Chunk and the list goes on) topped with vanilla ice cream.  After my friend told me how many calories there are in one, I passed.   =(1100 calories to be exact!!!!!  Luckily, my friend had birthday cake so it somewhat made up for the lovely Pizookie I could've had but maybe next time I'll try a different entree and share the Pizookie.=) Any takers?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=560

Happy hours that are worth the time and effort are not as common as they used to be but this is one of them.  Worth the time to check out the happy hour hour specials.  I enjoyed 1/2 off select bottles of wine on one evening and some shared appetizers as well!  Bottom line is if you are a mature adult that still enjoys a good time and doesn't mind a few little ones around then this place is awesome for its atmosphere, decor, food, service and BEER!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=560

Jeremy C.,"Denton, TX",0,28,,5.0,4/18/2010,"BJ's is a great addition to all of North County!  I am so glad that they have opened after visiting them three times in the past three months.  The avocado rolls are great.  We have had good service each of the three times.  The Tomato Bisque is really good, better than Karl Strauss's.   The buffalo chicken pizza is awesome as well.  They have a huge menu.  The Giant Bake Potato's are O.K. for me, we had the Chicken Alfredo ones and it was kind of short on chicken and extras, and nothing compares to a Giant Potato from Mcallister's Deli in Knoxville TN, yet we aren't there now are we?  I will make this one of my regular spots!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=680

It's me and I can't believe what I'm about to say but...the food at BJ's was pretty good, you should try it sometime - - you know, after a long day of work. For you avocado lovers out there, get the Avocado Eggrolls AND the California Club as your appetizers (notice I didn't give you a choice there, go for both!). For the main entree ""Specialty Pizza"" the angels sang. I enjoyed my Buffalo Chicken pizza here more than the deep dish I had in Chicago...I'm putting you on blast Giordano's!

shane s.,"Oceanside, CA",57,22,4,2.0,6/29/2010,"Unfortunately this restaurant is still going through growing pains.  The music is so loud that it hinders the wait staff.  Our food was good, would have been great if not for the fact we got it forty five minutes into our adventure.   The food was luke warm and my beer was not cold.   But my overall complaint is we came in for a birthday party and were there for an hour and forty minutes.  Mostly because we had to wait for food and then wait for our check.   Our poor waitress seemed over whelmed and frazzled, I spoke with the manager who was very nice, he gave me a $20.00 gift card to try them again, but unfortunately I just gave it away, I can't see paying the prices for the lack of service.  I won't try again.  Sorry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=680

Thank you, keep up the good work and who ever the manager is there needs to give you a raise or paid vacation! Or at least a gift card, you were amazing.

Susan B.,"Alexandria, VA",93,66,9,3.0,8/22/2011,"ok so if the ratings were based on food alone, i would give it a 4, but it's not, so i had to give them 3 stars.  The food is great.  I love their sandwiches and their deep dish pizza.  I have never been disappointed when I go here.  It's also kid friendly.  BUT the few times I've gone, it's crazy busy and always a line.  i've had bad experiences twice with their bar seating.  One time someone stole a table from us as we were about to sit down and another table as we were waiting for a family to leave they made some nasty remark when I was trying to be polite about it.  so i hate going to this place during busy hrs - weekends and evenings - b/c you only get attitude from the customers in the bar seating area.  not worth it to me.  IF BJ's did a better job of managing their seating arrangements, i feel like this wouldn't happen.  It totally made me not enjoy my meal b/c I just wanted to punch someone.  If you don't like busy-ness and alot of noise, than I recommend you go during the week and during the day.  It's much more pleasant.  I have no complaints about the waitstaff.  They have generally always been good to us.  Especially when one time it took 30 min. for our pizza to come out b/c the kitchen messed up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=680

Briana S.,"Oceanside, CA",0,6,4,4.0,2/1/2011,"My man & I have been wanting to try this place out for a whiLe ; just never reaLLy got the chance or had the time . The menu is a little expensive , but there were some good lunch specials . I had the 1 choice pasta (chicken alfredo) & 1 choice soup or salad (caesar salad) . This was one of the lunch specials , and I was expecting it to be such a small proportion that I would finish the whole thing , but I was wrong . The salad was decent , a good size , but you could tell it had been mixed ahead of time . It was a little on the soggy side . Now the chicken alfredo was on point . It was supposed to come with either grilled or blackened chicken , but being the picky person that I am , I asked if they could give me breaded chicken . Let me just say that the size of my chicken was GINORMOUS ! I would definitely order this dish again & I wouldn't be disappointed if the chicken proportion was smaller the next time either . Our waiter ryan let us know that he was still a little new to working at BJ's , but we really couldn't tell . He was very patient (we took a few minutes to decide because it was our first time) , made sure our drinks were always filled , & even offered us dessert options . The cream soda was REALLY good . It was strong & you could taste the quality , just the way my boyfriend & I like it . The dessert was a HOME RUN ! The only thing I had heard about BJ's before going there was how good the pazookies were & lets just say that the people who told me about it didn't give it any justice . We ordered the original pazookie with the white chocolate macadamia nut cookie . As soon as I had my first bite , my life felt complete ! Haha .. you really don't know what's missing in your life until you try a PAZOOKIE !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=700
AK C.,"San Marcos, CA",1,116,,2.0,9/9/2010,"First I should say that BJ's is one of my favorite restaurants, and my husband and I have been to the Carlsbad location many times since they opened last year. Normally the food is excellent and the service pretty good, but this review is about our visit on 9/5/2010 which was horrible. We have noticed the service getting progressively worse since early in the year. There were 6 of us and we sat outside because there wasn't a wait. It was a Sunday night and pretty cool out, so we asked first if there were heaters and they said Yes. They proceeded to sit us next to a broken heater. Naturally, we asked to move to one of the other open tables that had a working heater and the waitress moved us, although not too happily. We placed our order for an appetizer, 2 salads, and meals for everyone, then waited. The first salad appeared and we asked for utensils. She brought one place setting. The next salad appeared and again we asked for utensils and again she brought 1. Wouldn't it make sense to bring everyone silverware at this point? 30 minutes later the waitress returned to tell us they were out of our appetizer. Um, ok fine, you could have told us sooner but our food almost had to be done by then so we were ok. Nope. We waited another 20 minutes, then my husband went to see what was up. He requested to talk to a manager. The manager stopped by and said they were short on kitchen staff but our food would be done soon. He repeated our order and it was completely wrong. He corrected it and said it would be out shortly. The first meal arrived - a Great White Pizza. Except it was missing tomatoes and garlic. They said they were out of tomatoes. It's a pizza place!! After 10 minutes, 3 other meals arrived. Still nothing for my mother so we told them it was missing, and again it wasn't on the order form - the second time we had told them! About 10 minutes more and her food arrived with a bowl of tomatoes for the pizza! My sister ordered pasta and they forgot sun-dried tomatoes, olive oil and cheese in it. Wow. In the end, they comped our food and only charged us for drinks. It was a complete mess and we were so embarrassed about taking our family there and saying what a great place it was. Too bad, but we will definitely go to La Jolla or Escondido before we try the Carlsbad location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=700

Jim P.,"San Marcos, CA",0,18,,2.0,2/13/2010,"Beer is good, service was fine and food is a joke. Ordered wings and a Santa Fe salad as the waiter highly recommended it. Pal ordered a vegi pizza. Wings were 90% those gross vein ridden things that are attached to the drumett part and the entire order only had 2 drumetts in a pile of 12 pieces. The ranch and wing sauce tasted right out of a bottle and are not homemade. The salad that our waitress highly recommended was ok but there was not enough SALAD, it was 50% tortilla strips; seriously. I had a pile of tortilla strips 4 inches high that took up an entire side plate; that left me with what amounted to a side salad with some cold chicken pieces. The dressing was good but not enough on the salad. the vegi pizza was also disappointing; all bread; the toppings and cheese on the entire pizza was what typically goes on 1 slice anywhere else. what a joke, 14 bucks for some frozen bread with maybe 5 ounces of toppings. it seems this is another case of a business growing to fast for it's own good.

Jennifer G.,"San Diego, CA",0,9,,1.0,12/30/2009,"I must be a glutton for punishment...tried to give this place another chance.  Called ahead to be placed on the waitlist -- was told it would be 20 minutes.  Arrived exactly 20 minute later and was told it would be 25 minutes.  I said that there must be some mistake -- we called 20 minutes prior, asked to be placed on the call ahead seating list, and were told there was a 20 minute wait.  The girl (I'm betting it's Kelly, I wish I would have asked for her name) at the front then told us that we should be happy that we are in the middle of the list and that it would only be 25 minutes --  that they just had a few big parties come in between when I called and arrived...I considered asking to talk with a manager at this point, but my husband found a seat at the bar so we decided just to sit at the bar for dinner.  My husband ordered a beer, we ordered an appetizer (pot stickers) and our meals (one of the jumbo baked potatoes and a beef dip sandwich).  An hour and 20 minutes later we still didn't have any food.  We watched many others who arrived after us get their food. After about 40 minutes of waiting our server (unsolicited) apologized and told us it would be just a few more minutes and that my husband's drinks were on the house (I was drinking water).  At an hour and 20 minutes we asked to talk with the manager and told him we were leaving...he was very apologetic, asked us to wait that our food would be out in just a minute and that dinner was on the house.  We declined.  He gave us a $25 gift card to use the next time we come in ... I think if we use this I'll use it while traveling at a location other than the Carlsbad location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-carlsbad-2?start=700
