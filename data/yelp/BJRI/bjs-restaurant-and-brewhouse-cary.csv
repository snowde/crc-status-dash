Evan B.,"Raleigh, NC",247,4,1,4.0,8/17/2017,"Tonight, I went to BJ's with two friends.  We had all had negative prior experiences with BJ's with errors made with our orders.  We decided to give BJ's one more chance before writing it off permanently. The customer service tonight definitely won us over, and we will be back!  We alerted the server about our concerns from previous experiences, and she was very understanding and sympathetic to our situation.  Also, she alerted the manager about these concerns.  Later, the manager personally came over to our table and sat with us for several minutes, listening to our concerns and questions.  He made sure that our food came out just how we ordered, and checked on us periodically to ensure that we were doing well.  Our server was polite and helpful throughout the evening, too.   You can't beat BJ's extensive menu!  It is a little overwhelming, but there are all sorts of options, from healthy to sumptuous.  The food we ordered was satisfying, and the Pizookies (spelling?) we ate for dessert were out of this world!  My only complaint about tonight was the length of time for our food to come out.  We waited 25+ minutes for our order.  I even saw at least one table that ordered after us get served first.  Despite this issue, everything else about tonight was spot-on.  We will definitely be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cary
Kristen K.,"Cary, NC",107,181,28,3.0,12/1/2017,"Came here for a friend's birthday dinner so it was a table of around 8. The menu is overwhelming. I swear it was 20 pages, so there is a lot to wade through. Was a little hard to find exactly what you're looking for and took awhile to even decide because of all the choices. Service was great. Our waitress was kind, answered questions well, and was very prompt. I got the Barbeque Bison Burger which is part of the ""enlightened"" section. It was pretty good. Not the best burger I've ever had, but it was cooked perfectly and was pretty yummy.  Portion size was very generous. Everyone at the table was very pleased with their meals. My favorite part? Dessert. The Salted Caramel Pazookie was delicious. I absolutely want to come back and try more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cary
Valerie Z.,"Raleigh, NC",58,36,55,3.0,10/16/2017,"I recommended bj's to my visitor. Been to other ones before and love this place.  But last night we were all really disappointed. Half the menu items were not available. Ex: no mash potatoes for the chicken dinner or green beans, several pazzokies (the only ones I would have ordered), prime rib...which js my favorite. But it wasn't even busy.  I do like that the proceeds of the pazzokies was going towards hurricane relief but that wasn't told to us until we asked why they were discounted. Just a little disappointed.  Our server was great though. He recommended the pumpkin ale with a shot of fireball...omg...a must try! Loved it.  The parm crusted chicken...unbelievably delicious (would've been better with mashed potatoes and green beans but...). I would love to try this with mashed potatoes I bet it will be my new favorite. The chicken tacos...meh, they lacked a lot of flavor and the tziki sauce didn't help. Wouldn't order it again.  Hickory brisket burger...delish. ordered sweet potatoe fries yum! Not a lot on the dish so for the money maybe not. The other people in my party ordered regular fries and they were very generous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cary
Pj C.,"Cary, NC",0,11,,2.0,9/19/2017,"One of the worst places I've eaten at since moving to NC. I was so excited to try it and heard great things about it. The drinks (alcoholic) cake out super fast, which in our experience never happens it always takes them a little while to get you your drinks from the bar. When we ordered our drinks we put in an appetizer order, the waiter came back about 5 minutes later (we asked for time to look over them menu) and then placed our entree order. About 15 minutes later still no appetizer, the waiter then says he is going to go check on it. Out comes the appetizer *cold as ice* and not even 2 minutes later come our entrees. Which explained why the appetizer was cold, cause it had been sitting there waiting to be brought out for a while. However both entrees were ""warm"" at best, the ""pulled pork"" on the sandwich I ordered wasn't even pulled pork it was chunks of pork on a stale bun.  We wanted to order the churro dessert they had but decided it would be better to leave.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cary
LeAnne W.,"Wake Forest, NC",48,78,63,2.0,8/25/2017,"I was in Cary and thought I would try some place new. Well I should have checked the yelp reviews before I stopped for lunch. It was disappointing. I was greeted quickly and seated quickly. My server was also prompt. I ordered the Prime Rib Dip. It was disappointing. There were large chunks of fat on each and every piece of meat. So much so that I had to go through the entire sandwich before I could eat. After picking all of the fat, I had enough meat for 1/2 the sandwich. Not good. I did tallboy my server who called in the manager. They offered me more food , but I declined. I'd that meal came out of the kitchen, I am not quite ready to try again.  Everyone was kind and polite which is why I am willing to give two stars. I will try this place again because everyone can have an off day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cary
Nicole F.,"Raleigh, NC",158,60,71,2.0,8/4/2017,"I really wanted to love this place due to the extensive menu options. Not happening. Tonight's dinner came with dirty Napkins. Not just one rolled napkin, but both of our Napkins bosted of different stain varieties. The staff is enjoyable, but the food is just O...K... Two visits within two weeks and so underwhelmed. The multi paged menu boasts of sumptuous dishes of a varied sorts such as deep dish pizzas, lighter calorie menu options, superfood options, Cajun varieties and more. The unfortunate part is that the food comes out of the kitchen looking nothing like the pictures or the way the menu describes. Kitchen staff on each occasion manages to omit or add something different that what was ordered.  If I return, (which will only be because the manager was kind enough to take care of our disappointing meal tonight) it will be to order an appetizer and enjoy the extensive tap beer selection. No more sad plated meals here for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cary
Julie C.,"Washington, DC",26,140,116,4.0,7/10/2017,"One of my only complaints about BJ's is that the menu is way too extensive! It was very difficult to choose what I wanted - sometimes too much variety is not a good thing!  I ended up splitting the appetizer platter with a friend and it was good. The stuffed mushrooms (ordered separately) were amazing and I wholeheartedly recommend. The wings were fine - not standout, and I did not like the avocado egg rolls. Even for someone who loves avocados, what a weird concept. The burger was cooked well and tasty, and I heard the cocktails were nice. The handcrafted sodas are great and the beer menu is extensive and also great. Good specials and pricing on all items.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cary
Ron W.,"Raleigh, NC",791,913,5921,3.0,12/26/2016,"If you're looking for beer and bar food near Cary Crossings, you can do far worse than the new BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse. Located near the old Golden Corral, BJ's offers up a huge selection of sandwiches, burgers, plates and pan pizza for Caryites! I've stopped in twice and had a good BBQ brisket burger along with an excellent pizza.  Decor at BJ's is modern and open, there's one large dining room with an enclosed ""patio"" area for more sunlight. It can work for a date, small group or family meal but not as well for large groups. Service is the achilles heel here at BJ's. The servers are a bit inexperienced and they deliver a mixed experience for your meal. But they are trying! So 3 stars for BJ's right now but I may change my mind after trying their signature Pizookie dessert some day....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cary
Heidi B.,"Cary, NC",0,8,,2.0,12/28/2017,"I really want to like BJ's brewhouse, as it's super close to my home. It's a nice building and interior. However, the food and service are very uneven. I've had a couple of decent meals, but most of the time - despite the really huge menu - the food is not very good. Also, the servers can either be fast and efficient or excruciatingly slow... even when the place is half empty. I recommend culling down the menu and really specializing in some things you guys can actually cook really well, and to the management: please train your wait staff better and make sure you have adequate staffing on busy nights.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cary

Olivia P.,"Raleigh, NC",16,128,284,2.0,10/27/2016,"Friday night dinner. Wait time of 50 minutes for party of 2. The place was absolutely packed but we did squeeze into two spots at the bar after a few minutes. Had drinks at the bar while we waited for our table.  DÉCOR-A Cool industrial brew house décor and lots of tables. BARTENDERS-A Bartenders were nice and did a great job with a packed bar. FOOD-D Bf had a barbecue bison burger and he said it was good. I did like his fries. I ordered Parmesan crusted chicken breast served with pasta alfredo. It had all the flavor of eating invisible food. Harsh but true, there was zero flavor. They do serve huge portions but I didn't eat much and didn't take the leftovers. It was reminiscent of high school cafeteria food when the lunch ladies tried to get fancy.   *In their defense, I basically came to a sports bar and ordered Italian food which is a bad idea on my part but if it's on the menu it should at least be decent* SERVICE-F Service took a looooooong time. We came in around 5:45pm and left exhausted and unfulfilled around 9:00 or slightly thereafter. We actually sat at the table discussing how long it took to order, get the food, get drinks, get the check, etc. Server made some mistakes with the food and refilling drinks but he was new so I'll give him a break. I would stop here for a drink at the bar on a weekday but would NOT return for a meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cary
Stephanie H.,"Holly Springs, NC",399,914,3027,3.0,10/8/2016,"BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is a restaurant that has opened in Cary (near Crossroads) in the space formerly occupied by Golden Corral.  For drinks.. Mom went with a mimosa, I would not recommend since it was almost $9 (there are too many brunch spots around with mimosa deals) I decided to try the beers that they brew so I ordered two flights. The beers were okay, if I had to pick a favorite it would be the Harvest Hefeweizen.       -Flight 1: Blonde, Harvest Hefeweizen, Jeremiah Red Ale and a Bourbon Barrel Stout       -Flight 2: IPA, Piranha Pale Ale, PM Porter and Tatonka Stout    For food.. We decided to split the Ahi Poke, Chicken Pot Stickers and Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms. All of the food was good but nothing was great. The Ahi Poke did not have enough avocado in it and the dumpling was too thick on the pot stickers. And, the food took forever to come out but I thought that our server did a great job taking care of us.  The space itself is huge and a good spot if you want to check out a game.

Tammy M.,"Cary, NC",27,181,264,5.0,9/22/2016,"Couldn't wait for their opening !!  We were immediately seated on a Wed evening.  After glancing at the menu we decided we wanted to try the specials that were only available in the bar seating area.  We switched over to the bar. Our waitress was fabulous !!  She explained all of their ""brewery"" beers and mentioned that they were all $4. (NOT the Octobefest).   The beer was very good.  We tried the boneless wings (buffalo style) and the California Flatbread.  Both were delicious. If you are going to go here and eat/drink be sure and download their APP.  I downloaded while we were there and we got a FREE Pizookie (it was a small one).  This dessert is like ""what"" !!!!!!!  It's so good !!!!  The small one looks like it was baked in an easy bake oven but once you take a bite......""who cares where it was baked"".  This dessert rocks !!!!!   Be sure and give it a try.

They seated our party of four at a tiny booth, I came later in the party and told them we would be moving to a larger booth. They seemed a little peeved that I did this, but I really would rather be comfortable. Our waiter was a little creepy, I felt like he was lurching over us. It seems like it could be a decent place if they were super busy, but at this time it was okay. The prices were about what I expected. The food was okay, it reminded of a decent bar food, but not restaurant quality food. I had a club, and it was okay, but nothing special. I ordered a peach tea which was also, nothing special.

The wings were good, the ribs were good, but the shrimp arugula tacos were so over priced, $ 11.25 for 3 baby shrimp and done arugula- no guacamole, no pico de halo, plain and only 2.  We'll give it another try when we are not with a big party, I hope the tiny, braided hostess will have been trained to be courteous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cary

The tomato and mozzarella salad was tasty with nice presentation. Hubby's fries came out hot and crispy and he enjoyed the chicken fingers. Amazing selection of beers including hard ciders.

Brendan B.,"Apex, NC",2,20,8,2.0,5/16/2017,"My family visited BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse for the first time this past weekend.  We were excited since the Cary/Apex area needs more nicer, professionally-run restaurants. The building and interior are beautiful, so expectations were high.  We sat at a high table in the bar area since the dining room was full.  The bar is probably the best-looking and well-designed bar I've seen in a long time.  Our waitress came and presented us with the large menu. I cannot believe they have a menu this large.  It goes on for pages and pages.  There were so many things I wanted to try.  When our waitress took our drink order, my wife asked if the sweet tea was really sweet.  The waitress replied ""It's sweet."" Okay.  Not sure that helped much.  We all ordered sweet tea and it must have been sugared twice because it was way too sweet.  When we told her, she brought a glass of unsweet tea for us to mix.  This was all a hassle, made a mess and never was really corrected throughout the meal.  The waitress never really did fix the situation. The manager did stop by and said he had made new tea and brought some, but it was under-sweetened.   I got the Prime Rib Dip, which looked good, but at $14+, it had better be great.  It was on par, if not slightly below, the Beefeater sandwich at Jason's Deli, which is only $8.99.  The fries were good. My daughter got Chicken Alfredo, which wasn't very good.  The pasta was bland with no seasoning, but the sauce and marinated tasted odd. How do you mess up a simple pasta dish?   Overall, the food was disappointing based on the price and expectations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cary?start=40
Lauren P.,"San Diego, CA",2,4,,1.0,11/11/2017,"Absolutely awful experience! There is zero communication between the entire staff. We called ahead to be put on the waiting list. When we got there she said when we called it was an hour wait but that we'd been waiting 20 minutes by that time but that we'd probably be seated soon. Fast forward 40 minutes later where I watched 2 people who walked in and hadn't called ahead be seated before us. We complained and they said oh we called you, party of 6? We said no, there are 3 of us. She sat us, had the manager come apologize and offer a free app. The manager failed to tell the server that so he said he had to check with the manager first to see if we could have a free app. Then I asked about what the Veteran special as they were offering a free meal for Veterans Day and ensured I showed him my id then. We had two servers try and bring us other peoples orders. The calamari came out and was terrible! It was essentially fried breading with no calamari but hey it was free. The rest of the food was subpar, we also asked for ketchup and ended up getting up ourselves to ask another table if we could have theirs since it was taking so long. The check came and he took off the appetizer, but not my meal. My father asked and he said ""oh I didn't know she was a vet"", and my dad said ""she showed you her military id"". Oh and a different server passed by our table and used it to fix his menus by hitting them on the table. Overall I wouldn't recommend this place and I will never go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cary?start=40
j m.,"Wake, NC",1,56,,4.0,2/2/2017,"Made our first stop in here on New Year's Eve and came away happy.  The mission was a light meal and drinks before our scheduled movie at Crossroads; there was a wait for tables but we were able to snag the last two seats at the bar.  Watching bartenders work, and interact with the servers, can tell you a lot, and the bartenders here are experienced and smart (which they need to be since it's both a ""brewhouse""* and a full-service liquor bar including many specialty drinks), and were able to guide the less-savvy servers (and in one case, the manager) on in what was in various drinks.   Tried a flight of their house beers which ranged from OK to very good.   Yes, the menu is big but not completely illogical.  We had a flatbread and the Ahi tuna salad, both of which were a notch above standard bar food both in quality and asking price.  I'm looking forward to working through other parts of the menu.   The environment is quieter than the Ale House (where isn't it), less goofy than Red Robin and a bit more upscale all around.   I see the mixed reviews on table service and you can't always judge this properly from the bar (nor on NYE) but our experience so far was definitely good enough to come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cary?start=40

Robert R.,"Fuquay-Varina, NC",2,38,16,5.0,11/19/2016,"I have always been a fan of this restaurant chain. My fiancé is from California and they have a lot over there. I was very happy to see them come to Cary. This place is more elegant and upscale than Ale House. Ale House is geared more towards large groups and younger people who just want to hang out and drink while the game is on. This place is geared more towards people who want to enjoy a game or a drink and not deal with rowdy people.   I will say that their beer selection isn't as diverse as the Ale House's. Roughly 70% of their beer is their own specialty beer. Which I don't mind. I like trying new things. It's a great place to go on a date or to meet family or friends. The food is fantastic and the service was great.

I ordered the lunch spaghetti and my husband ordered a grilled cheese meal (avocado, bacon, tomato, cheese) fries and a cream soda.  The spaghetti was so spicy it was almost chili! The overwhelming flavor was chili flake. I, too, put chili flake in my spaghetti but this amount is way too much. The portion was huge. I would like to pay a little less and get a little less. No one wants a to go bag at lunch.  My husband said his sandwich was great except his bread was somewhat greasy, it had been over buttered or left to sit. In addition, the cream soda tasted fake. He likened it to a dum dum lollipop!  However, we both agreed the fries were some of the best we both had ever eaten.

I first went to a BJ's in Florida and have been wanting one in the triangle area for some time.  Thank goodness this place opened.  The menu is large (cheesecake factory large) so there is something for everyone.  To me the real shining stars are the deep dish pizzas and pastas.  The burgers, sandwiches, steaks, and the rest are all good, but the deep dish is on my top five list up there with the great ones in Chicago.  It's less greasy, but full of flavor and has the perfect buttery crisp crust.  So ignore the haters.  This is a wonderful place to eat and drink while watching a game on one of their numerous TVs, or sit away from the TVs and just visit with friends over amazing food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cary?start=40

So maybe I was wrong; one kitchen can possibly turn out really good Asian Fusion, Handcrafted Burgers, two kinds of Pizza (very thin or signature deep dish), Seafood, Steaks, top notch Apps and killer Desserts (baked in their own pan cookie creations or Monkey Bread topped with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream). Our table ordered a little bit of everything and shared it all.  The Avocado Egg Rolls were delicious, a tasty combination of ingredients fried quickly to perfection and served with sweet tamarind sauce.  Crisp Potato Skins had excellent texture, I think they must bake then flash fry right before topping with the hickory smoked bacon / cheese and then a last minute quick trip into a Salamander.  Not greasy at all, an old favorite brought back to new standards!  Several varieties of wings were ordered, I liked the regular with Sriracha Dry Rub the best, did not care for the boneless too much.   To finish up our table tried the thin crust Pizza.  All toppings were top quality, the Italian Sausage for instance was in nice sized pieces and had a very good flavor, spiced just right.  I saw several people enjoying the Deep Dish Pizza and it looked filling but great.  That would be on my list to try on a future visit for sure.  Beer selection was more than adequate, not sure total # of taps but plenty.  Some guys with me had flights and were not disappointed with anything they tried before picking favorites.  I saw they had a limited release Green Flash collaboration (a favorite West Coast Brewery of mine) - Hop Pact Rye IPA and went straight for that and stuck with it. Service was great, Jessica J. knew her beers and took care of us during a very busy Saturday afternoon.  A manager stopped by and comped an order of wings that took a bit too long without us asking which was nice.  I'll definitely add BJ's to my list of places to return to when in this area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cary?start=40

Erica B.,"Raleigh, NC",2,48,20,1.0,12/14/2016,"Our second visit was a huge disaster. Since there are limited late night dine in options around the Triangle area, we decided on BJ's last saturday night. They were open until 1am, but there were only one other table when we arrived around 11:45pm. The host didn't seem to be happy to see us. Then he reluctantly proceeded to seat us.  We quickly ordered some appetizers and four Top Sirloins. When the sirloins came out after 30 mins of waiting, we disappointedly found out that NONE of their temperature was cooked right. The medium was cooked Medium well, and Medium well was cooked well done. We brought it to our server's attention, and without telling us what she was going to do, she just turned around and left. We had to yell to get someone's attention to find out where our server was. We realized from that someone that our server went to order us another sirloin. That someone happened to be the manager, and seems to know exactly what was going on. However, it was a shame that he didn't make the initiative to make things right before we had asked him to come over. He discounted our checks, but did not to take the returned sirloins off our check. We had to point out him that we were charged for the orders that we had returned. He later took the returned sirloins off the check, but removed the discount. He seemed a little annoyed, and seriously we feel apologetic to cause such a scene late Saturday night. However, as a customer, we didn't feel like we were treated well, not to mention friendliness service. We left on a hungry stomach because we barely had anything to eat.  We are full of the mediocre food and service. This location offers great Grand Opening deals, but sorry, we will most definitely not return again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cary?start=40

Bill L.,"Apex, NC",0,13,4,2.0,7/27/2017,"Have wanted to stop here for quite a while, as it has a classy look that at least presents as an ""upper-end"" sports bar / gastropub. The first time I had tried to eat here they were just opening up and had a private party that night.  Unfortunately, my first experience was not up to par with what I had hoped it would be. The recent comments about having to wait a long time were not the case for me, as I was seated upon arrival and it was 7:45 pm - prime time for dinner and after work drinks for most, so that was certainly a plus. I got a table in the bar area and the noise level is fairly high, as one would expect in a sports bar type setting.  Unfortunately, speed of service at a restaurant has some potential negative consequences as the food staff tries to ""rush"" orders out. I had ordered a healthy salad with Cajun shrimp on top (fairly simple request and dish to make). When it arrived you could very easily see that about half of the shrimp were still raw, as they were gray like when you first remove them from the freezer raw.  Since my grandfather was a chef, I eat at restaurants all over the country, and I owned and ran my own food & environmental testing wcompany for many years that did ""mock"" health inspections for restaurants - I spotted the issue right away and called the waitress over. She was very apologetic & commented that it did not look right to her when she brought it out either. Since the largest section of the shrimp is what was still under cooked and grey, it is likely that they had pulled the shrimp right out of the freezer and threw it onto the grill, and thus the thickest part failed to cook as well as the tail section while it thawed on the grill. She returned it to the kitchen to get it corrected. Shortly thereafter the manager also came over to apologize and said that he would have it fixed as well (all good and appropriate actions). The new salad came out and was done correctly, with the shrimp pink but not rubbery from being over-cooked either. The manager said he would swing by to check when the new salad came out - but that never happened.  Since I was curious to see what, if anything, they may do for sending me undercooked shrimp (a good restaurant will offer discount, free drink or dessert, or coupon with request to ""please"" return) - I ordered strawberry beignet for dessert. Though it was certainly tasty, and probably not worth all the added calories, the center of it was raw dough as well and needed a few more minutes of baking time - again, a negative result of trying to rush the food out - likely because of prior negative comments on Yelp about waiting time. Fortunately, a piece of slightly raw dough generally won't cause a food sickness, unlike the havoc that some raw seafood can cause for a visitor. All said and done, the waitress did once again apologize and even removed the desert from my bill, as she felt bad about the raw shrimp. I always feel bad when a waitress does that as clearly the issue is the cooking staff at this restaurant. However, since she had noticed that it did not look right it may have saved her some trouble to toss it back at the kitchen staff before it came out to the table. Not sure if they have someone running the kitchen area or not but that would be a recommendation to hold the cooking staff accountable for the quality of what they're sending out - before it reaches the table. Running a successful restaurant in today's economy is quite a challenge, thus I try to weigh that reality when doing my reviews. Unfortunately, something like a foodborne illness can destroy the hard work and effort that an owner and their employees have put into building a new restaurant - so I felt that 3 stars would understate the importance of not sacrificing food quality and safety in the interest of appeasing some people who are not patient enough to wait for their food to be prepared properly. There is a lot of great food on the menu, but if someone gets sick from it all of the effort is for nothing. Far better to make someone wait and to give them a dish that has them telling their friends how great it is then to cut corners and risk of foodborne illness. It should also be noted that the staff was very friendly. However, with the Carolina Ale House being right next door I had really hoped that this would take it to another level especially when considering the prices. With tip I spent $20 for a salad. Unfortunately, the Ale House has them beat in terms of overall quality of food as I've eaten there many times and have yet to have a bad experience. A little more focus in the kitchen on the quality of the food would allow them to quickly raise the bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cary?start=20

I've been at least a half dozen times now.  Pros: Happy house appetizer and pizza specials. Large menu (think Cheesecake factory), gluten free options - including delicious pizzas, LARGE portions and good food.  Cons:Service is inconsistent. eg... one day the staff will tell you this is how they make a drink or what's in a dish or how they charge the next it's the opposite? Very frustrating for a regular customer. And it's often slow. The food is also pretty pricey for brewhouse fare. Don't be surprised when you get a salad and one drink and the tab is $30+. ouch. No outdoor seating. What? You guys couldn't wrangle that from the City of Cary? Pity.  That all said, this will not stop me from coming back.

Lindy P.,"Raleigh, NC",242,342,535,2.0,11/22/2016,"Yeah, no. More like 1.5 stars. I came here for a work dinner a couple weeks ago & was sorely unimpressed.  Located in the Cary Crossroads area near Petsmart, BJ's has a great idea & concept, but it's the epitome of an American chain restaurant. With a 19 page menu, what could you possibly perfect when your kitchen has 19 pages of meals to make?!  At least they brew decent beer...  The service was interesting, at best. We had a guy taking drink orders but deferred all food questions to a female server. With 15 guys & 2 girls at the table, the server made it a point to say ""Ladies it's 1/2 price wine night!"" (assuming guys don't drink wine?! or that ladies only drink wine?). Anyway, no thanks- I like bourbon neat. The drink guy didn't know what Basil Hayden bourbon was (& it was at the top of their bourbon list). A plus is that you get 2 free tastes of their drafts, which I enjoyed the stout (though on nitro, not my fave). With the crazy service going on, it took 30+ minutes for everyone to fully order a drink. Maybe you need 30mins to read the novel of a menu? After our drinks all arrived, we slowly got appetizers & the food runners would just come to the dining area & holler out what they had - not even to the right table or anything. WTF? To boot, the apps were just like an Applebee's samplers- nothing special... in fact, some things were really weird (i.e. parmesan cream coated boneless wings). For my entree, I ordered a ribeye cooked rare with a side of mashed potatoes & a caesar salad. The salad came out at the exact time of my entree, and I think it was warmer than the steak & potatoes combined. The plating was awful (an ice cream scoop of potatoes & a dry ass ribeye). All in all, this was just terrible. I'd say the service was some of the most horrendous I've had in a while, but man, that steak was atrocious too. It wasn't Applebee's priced either (think $25 for the ribeye). We were there for 2.5hours & not by choice, so I can't say I'd willingly make it back to this place.  Noooope.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cary?start=20

I was fond of Golden Corral as well and the transformation of the space was night and day. The new BJ's building is very modern and is situated in the same parking area as Panera and Aveda  at Crossroads. The glass edifice is very noticeable and a friend pointed out this chain of restaurants is from Texas.  We went on a Tuesday night and went during prime time. We were seated in a booth near the bar and had a view of the restaurant and TVs by the bar. The bar as well as the dining area were busy and I was surprised how quiet it was. Most bars and restaurants are so loud that it is difficult to talk amidst the noise. We also went on a Tuesday so all wines were half-price (score!) I had a very generous pour of La Crema Pinot noir for under $8. For my entree I had the tuna salad and it was a healthy and fresh choice. My friends had the flatbread pizza and it was thin crust with toppings. I liked the boards showing the beer offerings and believe BJ's has its own beer from Texas? I also noticed local taps like Fortnight from Cary. The food menu is very extensive with burger choices, steaks and plenty of options.

If you like local brews, this place has lots of options that they feature, are happy to give samples, and even do 4 flights for only $6! The wine options were pretty good as well. What I like most about this place is the atmosphere. It's busy but not too loud.

The main difference in my rating this time was the service. Though our waiter was very nice whenever we got his attention, having him come by our table was a tough one. They were very busy and clearly under staffed. So I just reached out to the manager who was glad to step in and take our drink orders after we had sat for 10min with no one coming up to us. It was about 20 min (since sitting down) when our waiter came with our drinks and asked us what we wanted to eat. I just know, had I not gone and gotten someone to take our orders, we'd had sat there much longer without seeing a single waiter. At the end, he, for whatever reason, had issues with my bj's rewards cards so now I'll have to call up the restaurant to make sure I get my points. Either way I still enjoyed coming by. I had the stout again, still delicious. I ordered garlic parmesan chicken wings. Those were disappointing. The chicken was delicious, but being a garlic parmesan fiend, the barely-drizzle-of-the-sauce on top was rather disappointing. Ate them all anyway. My friend had the open faced burger.

She offered something else but I declined thinking it wouldn't take long at all to make my pizza. I was wrong. Finally a manager came over and said the pizza was on him and I took him up on his offer of something else. I asked for tortilla soup and said we'd need to take the pizza to go...our son's bedtime was creeping up.  The tortilla soup was soooo salty that I didn't eat it - I couldn't. Didn't bother to say anything because this was turning into kind of a train wreck. Waited more for the pizza and asked for the check. An hour an a half total spent here and I can't say I would go back. My pizza ended up not tasting great, the soup wasn't good, and overall it left a bad taste in my mouth (no pun).

Taylor M.,"Cary, NC",0,137,1,2.0,4/9/2017,"I've now tried a couple of these chain restaurants and the service and food have proven to be spotty at best.  The local Cary version is OK for what it is, but I guess I'm not into what that is anymore.   Any time a restaurant boasts about the breadth of their menu, run the other way.  They proudly pointed out to our party the voluminous menu.  As I have stated before, I'd rather eat at a place that crafts six dishes very well than a place with a monster menu. There is no kitchen in a chain restaurant yet designed that can make that many diverse meals consistently good.  Just like Cheesecake Factory, BJ's is another case in point.  Their beers are just OK, and there's nothing spectacular or really interesting about them. The trend in modern taverns and pubs is to have a variety of beers from a variety of brewers. At BJ's, it's just not fun to have their house brews foisted on you.  They make a lot of styles, but like their food, the quantity works against quality.   The food we had was bland bar food.  I've made the mistake of ordering food like jambalaya in places like this, because I knew it was guaranteed disappointment.  They can barely whip up a burger.   The waitstaff was indifferent if not totally inefficient. I assume there is lots of turnover in the waitstaff ranks and likely the kitchen as well.  It just comes off as one of ""those"" places.  It looks like the type of place you can convince your elderly, teetotaler aunt to go on Sunday afternoon, so at least you can grab a couple beers.

I've had worse beers at fancier brewpubs. The food was also decent and a good value. The menu was big -- too big -- but with a number of delicious-looking options. We both got tacos and enjoyed the soft pita shell that had a nice brown crust. The side was a slightly sweet grain-based salad with corn and black beans. Nothing fancy, but it was satisfying and a good weeknight meal. The service from Geneva was awesome -- she was friendly and had a great sense of humor, and was very efficient.

Ann D.,"Apex, NC",8,25,,4.0,4/23/2017,"This was our first time visiting a BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse.  We arrived about 12:30 on  Sunday and were seated promptly.  The menu has so much variety.  I was particularly happy to see the EnLightend menu which has many options for lighter as well as gluten free fare.  Calories counts are included.  I do wish they included calorie counts for their standard fare, but I guess they figure those who order off the EnLightened menu don't care!  They also have gluten free options for pizza and their famous dessert Pizookie.  We did not try the Pizookie, but we plan to in the future. it looks divine. As far as prices, they are a bit on the high side.  I ordered the New Roasted Shrimp Peruvian Qunioa Bowl.  My husband ordered their half rack of ribs and some fries. The half rack came with a cole slaw that looked more like a salad.  My husband didn't want that so instead ordered the fries which was an upcharge.  They would not substitute the slaw for the fries which I found a little annoying since many restaurants do this with no problem whatsoever. And frankly, most restaurants would probably include slaw and fries for the price. Our food overall was actually very good. The only real downside to our visit was the slowness of the wait staff.  Our waitress seemed overwhelmed and it took about an hour to get our food.  We had a hard time flagging anyone to get ketchup for our fries and then it took another 20 minutes just to get our check.  Our waitress was very apologetic and even went into detail about how she had a mishap with a large party which slowed her down. Whatever the reason, we felt it wasn't something as a customer we need to be concerned with.  Management should be out there working themselves when there is a backlog!  I've seen it in many other establishments!   So if you like a menu with variety, give it a shot. Hopefully this slow service will improve.  We can't comment on their beer or handcrafted beverages, but they all looked very good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cary?start=80
Ray L.,"Fort Mill, SC",0,2,,2.0,8/28/2017,Been to BJ'S  3 times now and tonight will be the last.  Possibly the worst deep dish pizza I have ever had.  Kids chicken fingers looked like bojangles.  If you want very average chain bar food this is your place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cary?start=80

We overheard the FOH manager speaking to some other customers and I was impressed with his kindness and demeanor. He is well suited for the position. Overall great experience. Only complaint is it did take a long while for the good, but it's s brand new restaurant so I wasn't surprised. They were on a wait the entire time we were there. I'm sure it will improve.

Joe P.,"Sanford, NC",0,2,1,1.0,8/27/2017,I was highly disappointed with the pizza. I love Chicago style pizza and this is not even close to authentic. It tasted like a Pizza Hut deep dish pizza. That is not a bad thing just not what I was looking for. Based on the price and what it actually was I will just order from Pizza Hut.

Michael N.,"Raleigh, NC",77,7,1,4.0,10/2/2016,New to the scene is BJ's in Cary. A friend and I have went their twice so far. It's a very open area with good seating and flow. We dabbled in their beer selection and had some appetizers. We had no complaints with either. The beer had some ups and downs but that's not to knock the establishment as everyone has different flavor pallets. The appetizers were really tasty though.  Overall this place is in a great location for me and has everything a Brewhouse needs... beer and food. The one flaw I find is there isn't any outdoor seating. That is the only thing I wish it had.

Stephanie R.,"Raleigh, NC",1,67,,2.0,11/26/2016,Great server meh food.  Went for lunch the other day decided to try it.  We ordered their signature dish their deep dish pizza.  Don't be fooled this is NOT a deep dish pizza this is a thick crusted pizza nothing more.   Now for money it is so not worth it minimal topping and cheese the sauce I guess was ok we needed to ask for more there was almost none on the pie.  Very disappointing.  We also order the sliders as our app as we expected it to take a while it didn't in fact the pie was out before our appetizer.  The sliders sigh were to start? Well meat - it didn't even cover the bun and was about 1/8 of an inch thick it was all bun not worth the 10.00 it costs.  This was a not do again.  We wanted to like it.  The floors are horrible dang near slipped down the ramp and fell on my rear.  A deep dish place would have been great for the area pizza huts is better,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cary?start=80
Kathy B.,"Cary, NC",0,11,,2.0,3/18/2017,"Service:  Not intuitive in the least, did not know how to properly handle food or drink issues. We had so many things go bad that he should have sent a mgr over for damage control. Corp chains have pretty standard SOP's for this type of thing.  Food:  pizza under cooked, ribeye had so much fat that 25% was left on plate after cutting around all of it.  Broccoli was 95% RAW with no seasoning whatsoever - like what you'd get on a veggie tray/ranch dressing. Told the waiter - ""sorry"" was all we got.  Sirloin was about 1/2 the size of the picture on menu. Wedge salad was good, brussel sprouts too salty. Drink:  Beer good, but margarita was so sweet it was like drinking syrup water. Told the waiter and he waffled and stammered, and we finally said, ""please take it back, we don't want this"".   #reactandtakactionplease Prices:  too steep on many items.  $16.25 for a personal pan size pizza.  Thought my $16.25 sirloin was properly priced until I saw the size of it.  Atmosphere:  nice, fun and well designed. As we walked out the door, we saw a sheet that stated prime rib special all weekend - looked awesome, but sadly our waiter never bothered to tell us about it.  Two ppl in our group said that's what they would have ordered #hadtheyknown  :/ Hope mgt regroups with their servers and perhaps reassesses their skills.  Need to alert servers to bring in the mgr when a table has multiple issues.

I've been to the bjs in TX many times so I know that it's possible for them to do a good job. Someone needs to turn this place around. I'm obviously not the only one who feels this way.

When she finally asked for it to be medium, he said he would make sure the Chef knew. It came out well done. Over done. The entrees came right after the appetizer was served. I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken. It was ok. Mashed potatoes were very dry.  Our waiter never came back to check on us or see if we needed anything else to drink or even how the food was. When he finally returned for us to order dessert, he immediately came back with the check before the dessert arrived. Still not asking if we wanted anything else to drink.

Jessica R.,"Raleigh, NC",0,8,,1.0,9/25/2016,"On 09/25/16 at 4pm, my husband and I were really looking forward to trying this place! As we walked up to the door, we noticed two kitchen employees in their uniform smoking outside on the black bench to the left of the restaurant. We approached the host stand anyway. The host was busy doing something to the computer and did not acknowledge us for 45 seconds (they were not busy and we were standing literally 2 feet from him). Finally, he looked up and seemed genuinely surprised we were there...or maybe we interrupted his game of Candy Crush, we will never really know.  We were sat and given menus. The menu looked delicious and the beer list is to die for (I was gonna try the roasted kale and brussel sprout salad)...But you know what? We never were given the chance to order anything. We waited 9 minutes. Six waitstaff passed us and not a single one said ""hey I'll be right there"". The table behind us was arguing with the waiter that he incorrectly charged items on their check. Huge red flags everywhere so we decided to leave. As we left, the host WHO JUST SAT US 10 minutes ago says 'have a nice night'...Really? So I told him we waited for 10 minutes and no one even came over to greet us. He rolled his eyes and just said 'sorry'...Apparently this must happen quite often. Anyway, if you got PLENTY of time, try this place out. But if time is of the essence to you, do what we did...go down the road to Waverly Place and try out T. Mac Restaurant. Equivalent menu and equal OR BETTER beer list than BJ's. And they acknowledge you and appreciate your time. I know BJ's is new, and I was ready for some bumps, but not a freggin' cigarette stinking giant road block you can't get around.

(We really love good root beer!) They also served it up in a frosty mug so it had those tiny little ice crystals at the top of the drink--perfect!  For my main dish, I got the southern fried chicken with white gravy, cheddar mashed potatoes, and succotash.  Nice warm, home style type food, and the chicken was very tasty.  There was a slight misunderstanding in the kitchen so I got the lunch portion instead of the dinner portion that I had requested, but they realized the issue without me having to say a word, and fixed it immediately.  The customer service and attentiveness we received was top-notch, between our waiter and the management staff.  Atmosphere wise, the place would be great for a group outing, or watching a game with the good sized booths and big tv's spread out on the walls.   Overall, great visit, and we'll be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cary?start=120

Their staff were great and you would not know that they had only opened ONE DAY earlier! Although there was a lot of staff on hand, things appeared to run smoothly and I am impressed at how well they were doing. My friend had the Bacon/Avocado/Cheese sandwich and said it was greasy goodness. I had the buttermilk fried chicken and mashed potatoes. All was very good. Comfort food, not so much bar food, but their entire menu includes burgers, pizza, etc. and everything that people ordered looked great and plentiful.

We had our order taken promptly and received our food and beer much faster than expected, so that was a plus. Unfortunately, the wait staff in the bar area were wandering around lost, offering us everybody else's food because they were unsure of the correct tables, which was unprofessional at best. There were also some minor flaws with our order (I ordered no tomatoes on my sandwich and got them anyway, etc.) and it took over 20 minutes for us to get our Pizookie.

So while our two colleagues politely sat and waited with us for our food, as their soups got cold, even though we pleaded for them to start eating, our food finally came out about 10-15 minutes later. Our waiter explained, the soups and salads always come out first. Even when we wanted it as our meal? The entire lunch took about 1 hour and 40 minutes, way over our normal 1 hour lunch break.

Charlotte R.,"Apex, NC",0,49,,3.0,6/4/2017,"I went on a Sunday afternoon and the place wasn't too busy. The menu was extensive and unique - it had many items I rarely or never see in other restaurants. Prices were reasonable and most of the food my table ordered tasted good. Environment was nicely decorated and comfortable. Waiters were friendly and attentive. Food did take a bit longer to arrive than most other restaurants, but that's the downside of having a monstrously large menu. It slows down the kitchen significantly. The only things wrong were unfortunately really big things to get wrong - cleanliness and food safety. The booth I was seated at had food on it when I sat down. Both mine and my husband's cloth napkins had bits of someone else's food in them when they were unrolled, and my utensils came dirty. My husband's drink came with a greasy straw that also had chunks of food on it - maybe the server who placed the straw had dirty hands? The artichoke dip we ordered came cold as if it had been scooped out of a pot that had been sitting in the back kitchen for far too long and the cheese sticks and avocado rolls were lukewarm. Given that their sanitation score is just 92, I worry what goes on back there. My husband had come here a couple weeks ago and had a similar experience with severely undercooked food that had to be sent back to the kitchen. I do give the manager a lot of credit for trying to make it right and taking some stuff off of our bill. But as long as cleanliness and food safety remains something of an issue here, I am very hesitant to return. My husband wants to give them a third chance but I will personally wait until the sanitation score rises.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cary?start=60

Sadly, Dining Service was very disconnected between Waitress taking food/drink orders and Kitchen Staff delivering food order. E.G: Food arriving before Drinks. When asked, those delivering food acted like they did not know anything about the drink order. It appeared staff were blaming each other for the disconnect.  At the end after not receiving our coffee until we finished our dessert, Management did not charge us for the coffee. The 3 Stars are for the 30 minutes Excellent Service at the Bar and Excellent Food; however, the 1.5 hours Disconnected Service in the Dining Area needs attention.  It appeared Geneva, our Waitress was spending more time trying to get 6 male customers to apply for BJ'S App than ensuring we or other Customers received our  Drinks or Food in a timely manner.

Samantha P.,"Holly Springs, NC",10,59,12,4.0,4/16/2017,"So far I've visited this restaurant twice. The first experience was very disappointing due to poor quality control of the food coming out of the kitchen even though the service was otherwise great. My friend is a member of their rewards program and wrote a review through the app. She was soon contacted by the manager who was genuinely concerned about our poor experience and asked that we give them another shot, offering a gift card as incentive. The management definitely seems to care about the success of the business and values feedback.  We went back today to give them another shot and the food was much better. We didn't let the manager know we were there as a kind of 'blind' test and we were pleased with how it all went.  The food is all typical American fare burgers, pizza, pasta and such. Between the four of us we've tried the grilled cheese, California club, a tavern pizza, burgers, and the Parmesan chicken. So far nothing has struck us as amazing, but the beer selection is good draw. I think we'll be giving this place a few more chances and hopefully find some dishes they excel at.  So far the berry cider is my favorite and the cookies n' cream pizookie is divine!

I can say every time I've been, almost every seat in the place is occupied.  I like the huge slate board on the wall that shows what beers are on tap and is nearly visible from anywhere in the restaurant.  The deep dish pizza is very good with that buttery, crispy crust. The sweet pig is my fave. You can order online using the app and choose take out or curbside. On the way to a friend's house, I decided to order a few pies and try the curbside pickup. The pickup process was a little clunky as once you park, there is a number on a sign to call. The number was busy for several minutes. Once they answered, they asked for my order number, confirmed what the order was then asked for my name. I paid with a card so they took the card back inside after they brought the food then brought me a receipt to sign. Total, the pickup process took about 15 minutes.

I went back there alone for lunch and figured I'd give the pizza one more shot.  Instead of a special, I just ordered extra cheese and meatball.  Again, BLAND!  No taste at all, and dry!  If there was extra cheese, I could not tell.  About two inches from the crust, there was nothing.  As far as meatballs go, and this is not an exaggeration, it was as if they scooped out a teaspoon of meatball and sprinkled it on a large pie.   I questioned my super friendly waitress if this was really an extra cheese with meatball.  She said that's what she ordered for me.  The manager came over an offered to make another but I passed.  It was just a waste of calories.  I had tiny slice and left it.  I can enjoy a bad pizza, and even a cheap pizza as well as a good NY style (Try Ricci's Trattoria-the best!!!), but this was just dry and tasteless dough.   I'm afraid to waste my money on anything else there based on these items.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cary?start=60

I then had chicken wings (I use a s a gauge for all chains) and it was nothing special but over priced.  It seemed that they tacked on 3-4 for every item thinking no one would notice.
