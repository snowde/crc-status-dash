Tammy O.,"Cedar Park, TX",175,242,968,4.0,10/16/2017,"It's that time of year for the pumpkin ale. This was the first time for us to try it.  I was excited cuz other years we have missed out and we have heard such great things about it. Well, It was delicious. All there beers are great we really enjoy them.  We love there apps. We usually start out with the flatbread pizza. Great sauce and love the crispy crust. This trip we tried the wings. Yum yum. They are fried great. We got the Nashville hot sauce. It was great. Kinda sweet and hot. Perfect combo. Next we ordered the chips with salsa and guacamole. Oh yum. The salsa is fire roasted. Goes really great with there beers. The guacamole was excellent. Kinda chunky and had great flavor.   Well we were still hungry so we tried the sliders with fries. Really good.  Meat and bun were done great. Some of the best sliders I've had.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cedar-park
Amanda J.,"Austin, TX",1,38,8,2.0,1/9/2018,"This is specifically for curbside takeout. We have ordered curbside takeout twice now, and been disappointed both times. The first time, we ordered 2 Pizookies on Tuesday night when they are $3 off. They told us it would be 15 minutes. I arrived at curbside right on time and called the number posted. The phone just rang for 3 minutes. I hung up and went inside. They told me it wasn't ready yet and they would bring it out. It took another 10 minutes to come. When I got home, both pizookies were very thin and not hot. Not as good as pizookies usually are. Disappointed. This was 6 weeks ago or so. Yesterday we ordered a large pizza that is half off on Monday and a Pizookie. The pizza was half Mediterranean and half cheese/tomato. I arrived exactly when they told me it would be ready. Again I called, didn't take 3 minutes to answer this time, but they said it wasn't ready yet. A few minutes later a server came out and told me they made the pizza wrong and it was going to be a while longer. Another 15 minutes goes by and the bring the food out. I asked for the server to wait to make sure the pizza was correct. It had no tomatoes on the cheese and tomato half. He offered to go get me some tomatoes but I declined; I like the tomatoes on the pizza cooked, I don't want to eat them on the side.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cedar-park
H H.,"Austin, TX",0,2,,1.0,11/30/2017,"Take Out: Ordered lunch special for take out today.  Have never ordered food to go from them and probably wont be in the future.   When I went to pick up my order it was not ready and had to wait. When I was told it was ready there were no fries.  They went back in the kitchen and returned with my sweet potato fries which were ice cold, makes me wonder if they were left over from yesterday.  The avocado on my club sandwich was brown with green around the edges. Wish I would have taken a photo before i throw it away.  Words of advice:  Check your order and make sure it is all there and that it is fresh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cedar-park
Lamanda B.,"Cedar Park, TX",203,111,64,2.0,12/14/2017,"First time coming here and it was quite disappointing. A great staff would make up for the food not being good, but that's not the case with BJ's. The best thing I had was the queso for an appetizer and pizookie for dessert. Our waiter stopped by the table all of 3 times unless we called on her. The sweet potato fries were dry and cold. The wing sauce was good but the wings were not crispy. They were extremely soft and I left them on the table when we left. This place looks like a great place to catch a game with friends but the food isn't good. It's just another food chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cedar-park

Alyssa G.,"Cedar Park, TX",16,41,62,1.0,8/5/2017,Been coming here for years and have spent a ton of money at this establishment.  But this time coming here I was highly disappointed in the food presentation and mainly quality.  Let's start with water and lemons sounds easy but no I was give rotten lemons that were visibly brown and slimy.  Then I Ordered soup and salad Caesar salad and clam chowder was my choice.  Clam chowder comes out like warm and the potato wash mushy and clams very hard. Definitely not fresh at all.  And my salad was browning on the romaine lettuce. Such a disappointment.  As for my partner he asked for his wings well done then did not cook to order.  And his burger was over cooked.  Either management is not doing a good job at training or the cooks just truly do not care about there jobs.  Not sure if I will be returning.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cedar-park
Paul R.,"Cedar Park, TX",76,548,60,3.0,6/23/2017,"I've had lunch here a few times so it is about time I write a review. Yupper it's a chain and they have a menu that goes on for ever. I really wish these restaurants would just slim down their ginourmus (sic) menus. So we sat in the bar area for a late lunch and as you would imagine the lunch rush was over. I'm pretty sure there was only one server as service was pretty slow. Our server, Nick, did a good job but we should not be sitting for 10 minutes before our menus are provided. Plus it took quite a bit of time to get our beers and when they arrived it was sans mine, keg problem. I was ready to throw in the towel and just head over to In-N-Out but plus 1 overruled me. While we are on the topic of beer BJ's has a pretty extensive tap selection. Hopefully next time my Ballast Point IPA will be servable.  Lunch: I opted for a new menu item a Peruvian salad with shrimp. This salad is served warm with Quinoa and was excellent. Plus 1 had a chopped chicken salad and said it hit the spot. So in spite to the slow start it's alls well that ends well. I can see myself stopping by again for lunch and a few of their tap beers.... or maybe just for a beery beery good happy hour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cedar-park
Doug W.,"Austin, TX",28,17,62,4.0,8/20/2017,"Had a seat at the bar this time and brought a date. The bartender was attentive and receptive. Thanks to her I was able to sample two beers on tap and settled on one of two amber beers called ""Oasis"". That went down quickly. Smooth and refreshing. We then ordered a new dessert, the ""Churro pizzookie"". Fantastic dessert. If they don't permanently add it to the menu, I'm gonna cry. Try it.

Scott K.,"Leander, TX",12,167,41,4.0,8/1/2017,"Celebrated my daughters 22nd birthday with family - mainly because of the Pazookies.  We had an amazing waitress (I wish I had written her name down) who made experience great.   My wife and I both had the Caesar Salad.  I usually like a lot more ""tang"" in my Caesar dressing so I felt it was missing some flavor.  Probably go with the ranch next time. It was rib night so I had the whole rack - honestly thought they were a little over done but flavor was still good.  They were average at best.   Daughter 1 had a Quinoa Bowl of some sorts - looked like it had some shrimp in it - she loved it.   Daughter 2 had Spaghetti & meatballs - she thought it tasted a little like Marie Calendars.   Wife had a sirloin which was perfect. Topped off with Pazookies which are always worth the trip.   Overall - Food is probably 3 stars / Service was 4 stars / Pazookie 5 star",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cedar-park

Already at home I noticed that pasta was missing chicken and broccoli was yellow and old, not supposed to use those for cooking. Called to establishment and asked if I can just get replacement next day, give them another shot. Instead manager said he will make a refund right away. Which is fine with me. Does not matter. Point is if you want to make customer come back then refund is not an option. Offer to come back. I also took one star for service. Person on the phone was not aware of promotion coupon and a young man who took my order was not professional while interaction. Food is good, fried avocado rolls must try.

We were seated immediately, then had twenty minutes to thoroughly read the entire menu and resort to staring at every server that passed us until we were finally greeted and our drink order was taken.  At 9:30 the food arrived and was hot and delicious. No complaints whatsoever with the pizza. However, our waitress didn't check on us, nor did she refill our empty drinks until we were done eating and we finally saw her and flagged her down. She brought the refill with the check.  Overall, good food and very poor service. I have worked in food service and I do understand the rush and what to expect.

George K.,"Pflugerville, TX",44,7,,2.0,2/24/2017,First time going to a BJ's establishment. Cedar Park TX.  Friday night at 7:45 pm.  Ordered a beer $6.25 for a 12oz. Shiner.  Really?  I ordered a medium pepperoni pizza for $20.50.  I struggled to find any cheese on top.  I asked for jalapenos on top also and they put about 10 pieces; about 1 jalapeno for each piece.  Crust was good.  I had good service by our waitress.  I will most likely not go back.  They are way to overpriced for the quality of food.

Rachel B.,"Austin, TX",610,473,960,3.0,12/7/2015,"I really enjoy BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse.  I had actually never been to one until I met my hubby a few years back and boy was I missing out!  I'm glad he showed me the light! The menu for BJ's is quite extensive and has something for everyone in your group.  Their pizzas are fabulous and come in so many different varieties or you can design your own.  My fave would be the White Pizza.  Anything with Alfredo sauce and I am in love.  My husband disagrees and always goes for the Classic Combo pizza.  It is good too, but not as pretty as the White Pizza.  Looks aren't everything, I know, but it is true in this case! They also have a ton of other things from burgers, sandwiches, steaks, brunch (on the weekends), lunch specials Monday-Friday, and even low cal choices.  I don't know anything about those because I am a full fat kinda girl, which is probably why I'm not a size 2.  They even have  french fry options!  Now that is just awesome because sometimes you want skinny fries and sometimes you want wedge ones.  GENIUS! And of course, they have a ton of beer!  They make about a dozen different beers and even switch it up throughout the year in the different seasons.  For you non-boozers, they also make their own root beer, cream soda, orange cream soda, and black cherry cream soda.  I always go for the cream soda and I am always happy. The service is usually ok, but it does waver, which is why I gave this location 3 stars.  Food alone is easily 4+ stars, but the service knocks it down.  Sometimes you go in and your server is on it, but sometimes, like my last visit, was a diaster.  Our food took 40 minutes to come out.  Some of it was hot, some lukewarm, and one had been under a heat lamp for way too long.  We were all so hungry (Warning, do not mess with my family when we are hungry because you WILL get hurt!), we didn't send it back because we were afraid it would take another 40 minutes and we had plans afterwards.  We were not the only ones with this problem either, as I heard the tables around us all complaining about the same things we were talking about.   I would say 90% of the time you will have a great experience, so definitely try it out.  And get some cream soda too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cedar-park?start=40

We did have an amazing waitress here, I forgot her name. She recently moved to the area and was so just nice and attentive. Another time we ate here i think we saw the waiter twice. I had to get someone else to give us our check.  They have a large menu so it's hard to think that most of the food that they have is fresh and not frozen.

Nancy P.,"Cedar Park, TX",110,400,636,3.0,10/28/2014,"Three times I attempted to go here for dinner, only to find the parking lot so packed. Finally gave them a shot for a Saturday lunch. Geez, parking still crowd but found a space. It is definitely a sports bar atmosphere, large screen TV's mounted on the wall. I was seated in a small booth between the Bar and dining areas. My server takes my drink order of raspberry iced tea. I peruse the menu to find something light. The watermelon Feta salad catches my eye, so does the corn fritters with bacon aioli.  Server comes back with my drink, and I check the booth for a sweetener. Nope, none to be found so I sip the tea. It is pre-sweetened already. I place my order and wait. The TV's are playing a local football game, now I know why the parking is crowded. The corn fritter arrives first. Five golf ball sized fritters laid on the bacon aioli sprinkled with corn and bacon. I cut one in half and dip in the aioli and taste.  Such disappointment, the fritters were mostly batter with a few kennels of corn, so not a fritter. The bacon aioli was spicy and no hint of bacon flavor. They weren't bad but not what was expected from the description. The watermelon and Feta salad was a different story. So cool and refreshing, will order this again. The server was competent and friendly. Too friendly, by the end of my lunch I knew a lot of their personal life. Yes, I know they do this so we feel a connection and give a bigger tip. Not with me. Feeling indulgent, I asked what they have for dessert. The server only told me about the Pizookies. So I order the chocolate chip pizookies. It is basically a 4 inch round hot cookie in a mini pizza pan with a scoop of ice cream on top. Was it good, YES. Was it worth $6.50, Hell No. One thing I noticed, lots were ordering their pizza. So I will come back for a pizza and beer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cedar-park?start=40
Jeremy W.,"Leander, TX",5,21,2,2.0,7/24/2016,"I'm not sure where to start with this.  I have tried this location of BJs Brewhouse 3 times and it has gotten progressively worse every time.  Today was the proverbial ""last straw"". We will not be going back. I have always thought this place is overpriced for both the quantity and quality of food.   We had some friends in from out of town and decided to go here because it was close and several in they party could not decide on exactly what they wanted.  It was busy, as one would expect on a Sunday at lunch, but we were seated fairly quickly and the place seemed adequately staffed for the volume.   Our waiter got to us quickly, took our drink orders, and got our drinks out pretty quickly.  He then came back and got our food orders.  Everything went fairly smooth up to this point.   As I looked around the restaurant after ordering, it became apparent that things were in a state of chaos.  There was a woman who I assume was the manager constantly moving back and forth handling problems at different tables, bringing food from the kitchen, etc.  There seemed to be no rhyme or reason as to how orders were coming out of the kitchen.  On two separate occasions, servers delivered food to our table that was not ours.  Refills were very hard to come by.  Our glasses sat empty for long periods of time.  I did not keep track of how long it took to get our food after we ordered, but it had to be close to an hour. When the food did start to come, it was delivered one or two plates at a time (there were eight of us) by several different servers. One of the orders came out wrong.  It was sent back and corrected.  One of the plates was cold, so we sent it back.  The manager did comp that meal for us, so that is one of the only good marks I can give.  The food was mediocre, but not worth the money.  Refills continued to be extremely slow.  We finally got the check and paid.  It took an extremely long time for the waiter to bring back the change.  Grand total from the time we walked in until the time we left.......2 hours.  About 1 hour too long.   Postscript: My son did not want his burger after filling up on fries, so we boxed it up and brought it home.  We got it out this evening to warm it up for him and noticed that it was overdone to the extreme.  The buns were black on the inside and the meat patty was hard, black, and dry.  My son opted to let the dogs have the burger, so we cut it in half to start feeding it to the dogs and noticed there was some sort of blue/green material ground up in the meat.  I have no idea what it was, but decided it was not even fit for the dogs. Too bad we were not able to get the burger comped too.  So, in summary, a disastrous experience that we will not take a chance on repeating.  Not sure why I am giving 2 stars.  I guess the friendly staff and the fact that the manager looked like she was trying to make the best of a bad situation gets them 2 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cedar-park?start=40

They were giving reward members double points until the end of September so today was our last day to take them up on the offer. It was squeaky clean inside, you can tell from seeing virtually zero smudges on their menus, and most of the servers were still in training. Ours was great and very knowledgeable. She had our food out quickly sans error and gave us just the right amount of space while still being close the second we needed something. My husband tried the bacon cheeseburger he rated as ""good"" along with the blonde brew which is both of our favorites. I got my normal Thai chicken salad, and we split the bacon corn fritters as an appetizer. I don't always order dessert, but when I do it's because it has pumpkin in it! There is a seasonal pumpkin pzookie right now which I have to say wasn't the best pzookie I've had, but it wasn't bad. Its a big pumpkin skillet cookie studded with cream cheese chips and topped with vanilla bean ice cream. When you first bite in it almost tastes like gingerbread from the spices, but then the pumpkin hits. Its in the same shopping center as Costco which will make it a great weekend lunch destination when we have to shop there.

Her salad was just cut up tomatoes w/small mozzarella balls. She loved it. Said her soup & salad were excellent. I ordered chili in a regular bowl w/house salad. My chili was not warm & the salad had a small problem. They immediately and cheerfully corrected both of these issues. I then enjoyed my chili and salad.

Craig R.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,2,,2.0,3/18/2017,"A restaurant with the word ""brewery"" in it should be an awesome place to enjoy good food and great drinks. As a local, I've tried this place several times hoping it would live up to the ""brewery"" name. It doesn't, not even close. It has a good sized bar, and their home brew is okay, but the food is just piss poor. I've tried burgers, salads, pizzas, you would think they could do something right, but they can't.  My last meal was blackened shrimp that came out lightly peppered, cold and under cooked. After it was sent back it came back with more of the same. Their home-brew porter was too light and sweet for me, but it was okay.  My dinner date had a salad and water they were happy with, but didn't order the wine they got last time because the price they charge per glass is obscene.  We also kept trying this place because they have a good selection of healthy meals. But when they keep coming out so bad, there's really no point.  There are just too many good, and even mediocre places to eat in the area, making this a place you should definitely not waste time with.

Eric S.,"Cedar Park, TX",6,58,,2.0,6/11/2016,"Compared to other BJ's in the area, this one just can't seem to get it right. First, it's a smaller footprint than some other locations, so there are some things on the menu available elsewhere you can't get here.   Why?  Who knows. Got here in the evening, not busy,  but despite having made reservations via the BJs app (which said ten minutes from when we made them, we got there ten minutes later) we had to wait 15 minutes to be seated.    Server was pleasant but man was the service slow.   Took nearly half an hour to get our food, and when it finally came, my steak (ordered medium) was cooked to shoe leather.  Sent it back.   More than a half hour after that. they finally got a properly cooked steak to me.   It was so bad the server came by at one point and asked me if they wanted them to box up the steak so I could take it home, since my wife had long since finished her food. We've come to the beer dinner's BJ's is known for and they manage to screw that up too.   The only reason for a two-star review rather than one is that the beer is good and the servers, totally at the mercy of the worthless cook, did as much as they could to make up for the delay. The BJs in Round Rock and Arbor Walk consistently do a better job than this one, so if you have a craving for BJs, go there instead.   We will.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cedar-park?start=40

Once my dish arrived the onions were still raw and crunchy, the shrimp no longer were the big ones but the small pasta style kind and the entire dish was dry and bland. Needless to say, I took 2-3 bites and pushed it away. As much as I enjoyed conversation with our server, he never once asked how our food was and simply just asked if I needed a box which I denied (almost an untouched dish)  A server and bartender of almost 10 years, I would NEVER not ask a customer how their food was ESPECIALLY if the food was untouched  I think it's safe to say I won't be craving that dish any longer  ($15 dish down the drain)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cedar-park?start=20

The waitress tried to take my appetizer plate while I was still working on the appetizer to make room for my entree that came out before the appetizers were half eaten. Oh by the way my salad came out approximately 2 minutes after the appetizers. So we has appetizers, salad, and entrees all on the table at once. She dis keep checking to see if the food was good (just as the first bite was going in). She failed to take away actual empty dishes or glasses. It took 3 trips to get a second set of beverages....... She was rushing us to order dessert when we about half way through the entrees. As I said this is the second time that we have been rushed through our meal at this location.

We like to sit in the bar area too, no wait no fuss. There are also tv's for sports if you're interested. Their beers are really good too. Their beer separates them from other chains that offer similar food. Our favorites are their light switch lager and the brew house blonde. I've tried them all, and they're all good in their own way.

Jason L.,"Leander, TX",88,81,64,5.0,2/19/2017,"My Fiance and I went to BJ's for the first time at this location and was my first time ever. I will say It's a very clean establishment and inviting atmosphere. Spaced well, not cramped and that matters to us. We enjoyed the night with drinks, dinner and dessert.  I had the Bacon and Guac cheddar Burger and my finance had the Roast Beef Dip sandwich. She thoroughly enjoyed her sandwich, my burger was well cooked and presented, and plenty of food for the price, but I will say the beef was a little bland, could have used a little more salt/pepper/flavor, but overall was a delicious plate. The service was exceptional, our waiter was very kind and attentive, fun conversation as well. We were served by Todd E (tipped him around 45%, he was that good), a young lad and very professional. The environment was friendly and the dessert was more than we expected, as well as delicious (you must try the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Pizookie! Melissa has the salted caramel, ummm). I will say their Tatonka Stout was absolutely delicious (never had a better authentic beer), not to mention 9% alcohol, but you wouldn't know it, as it was so smooth and refreshing with a hint of coffee/chocolate flavor, exceptional dark beer, and I love that. Go to BJ's Steakhouse on Whitestone Cedar Park, TX when you get a chance, well managed, well served, great food! We weren't going for the signature Entrees, that's for another night, but I'm sure they win all the same.

However, as time went on, that charm slowly faded away. I have been to this restaurant 5 times in total.  4 out of 5 times i have recieved cold/ lukewarm food. Ive ordered (In order of visits), Vegetable penne, Clam chowder, Baked Ziti, Lentil soup and Couscous mac and cheese.  First I was given the shrimp penne instead of the vegetable one which normally would would be fine except I'm allergic to shrimp. when I did recieve the correct order it was lukewarm. The Clam chowder I had suffered the same issue, as did the Baked ziti and the Couscous. Even the garlic knot was cold in the middle! I also had the Peruvian quinoa bowl which I found to be bland.  Service was kind of hit or miss for me . I did enjoy some of the appetizers I tried like the Stuffed mushrooms and the Pita nachos they were pretty good. The Orange cream soda I have to admit is a favorite of mine there.  Also, they do seem to have a wide selection of alcoholic beverages which I myself weren't interested in but I'm sure for those who are will enjoy that aspect.  Overall, this place is pretty average in my opinon. It's hard for me to say that because I REALLY wanted to like this place! With the abundance of mexican food around here I was looking for something different.  I just couldn't believe how consistantly I was recieving cold food. Not to mention this place isn't the cheapest! Leaving tonight with two Irish root beers, three entrées, an appetizer and dessert  for 70$ hardly felt worth it. This will most likely be my last visit.

My gf's fries had little /black/burnt pieces of something all over them and gave them a burnt flavor. Looked like burnt seasoning or something. I ordered the sirloin, and for $16 sirloin that was pretty weak. Maybe 6oz. The Brussels sprouts were gross and looked like they had been cooked for WAYYY to long. Zero color and completely mushy. My baked pot came out with nothing on it. I asked if it was supposed to be completely plain(who eats a plain baked pot?) and she said no, came back with the butter, sc, and cheese. But by that point it wasn't hot enough to melt the cheese or butter. But didn't taste bad. We felt very rushed. Like our server was about to be cut and wanted to go home. She dropped off our check before our dessert even hit the table..and it was the wrong dessert when it did hit the table. No biggie, we got the right one pretty quick after. But once we finished our entrées, our drinks were never refilled. I even asked for more water at one point and she never came back. So we ate our dessert, and washed it down with ice. Just felt rushed. Wasn't the worst service but it was pretty bad. She was still serving tables around us, just not us anymore.

Elaina R.,"Cedar Park, TX",4,20,20,4.0,8/13/2016,"Yesterday my family and I came here for dinner. We had a coupon for a free appetizer and we decided on mozzarella sticks. They were absolutely delicious and served with a pizza type of sauce with shredded cheese on top. It was very good.  For the meals, I had the pulled pork sandwich. The BBQ sauce was very tasty, but I did encounter a small piece of bone in one of my bites. The sandwich was served with a ""coleslaw,"" but it was dry and wilted. Kinda gross, but I had enough food as it was.  My mom had the road beef dip that she enjoyed. I have personally had it before and the beef has a very good flavor. The meal is simple and not too heavy. It is served with au jus which is great for dipping the sandwich or even the fries. My sister ordered the boneless wings appetizer in the bbq flavor with a side of fries. She liked them.  My dad ordered a ribeye steak that was average. BJ's isn't a steakhouse, so it was about what you'd expect, but not bad.  I think all of us could agree that their French fries are absolutely delicious. They are shoestrings, but very crispy and crunchy. They have good flavor. One of my favorites around here. On this occasion the waitress was friendly and did get everything we asked for, but she would disappear for a while at a time. This was kind of annoying when we would be looking to flag her down for something, but she did do a pretty good job. Our drinks were kept refilled and such, so there want much to complain about there. In past experiences, about 2 weeks ago from this past visit, we were brought to the bar for seating. I am a minor, as well as my sister and my parents highly dislike when we are brought toward the bar. It isn't appropriate for children.

Melissa C.,"Austin, TX",100,51,37,4.0,10/13/2014,"As everyone else mentioned, it's still early and there are kinks to work out. The key here is to visit the restaurant with the expectation that you will wait a little longer. Maybe this isn't the best time to bring your screaming, starving kids. Oh, did I say that out loud? Drinks: We enjoyed several of BJ's beers: Hopstorm IPA, Nutty Brewnette, Field Day IPA - all get the thumbs up. I'd recommend skipping the Jeremiah Red and Pumpkin Ale. Both were underwhelming.  Food: We played it safe since it was opening week and went with a couple apps [Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms, Watermelon + Feta Salad], the Crispy Jalapeno Burger, and Thai Chicken Mango Salad. The latter was actually pretty boring and I wished I had gone with a burger instead. So much for trying to keep the dinner calories low to save room for a Pizookie. Ah, the infamous Pizookie. Since we figured we'd be back again to try one of the menu staples, we went with one of the current specials: Salted Caramel. Hello, heaven. I slipped into a sweet, sweet dessert coma after that. It was a little smaller than expected and my boyfriend seemed upset that we were sharing versus him having his own. Poor thing.

I believe they intentionally give you plenty of time to spend time with friends and enjoy your meal. It's something I genuinely appreciate because I hate feeling like I'm being rushed out of a restaurant.

John F.,"Leander, TX",16,8,13,2.0,6/2/2015,"I've went to 4 different BJ's in CA & TX w/in first month of each opening.  Bad idea.   Consistently poor experiences with long waits, food not coming out the way ordered, WAY too much time in between waiter/waitress visits (app/entree/dessert orders, drink refills, extra napkins, straws, whatever... ""service"") & an overall sense of ""chicken with head cut off"" going on.  In addition to that, just too crowded and chaotic to enjoy the experience (Whether on a date night or w/our kids). Against my judgement, we went to the Cedar Park BJ's about 3-weeks after opening (too long of wait times on prior attempts) and I'd hoped that things would have settled down enough and the newness worn off for a decent experience.  One word: Disappointed (for all the common reasons given from previous first-visit experiences above).  Consistent, but not in a good way. So, I have not been back here since.  I will try them out again this summer after they (hopefully) have their act together better.

The first time at the Cedar Park location I went with my son.  It was busy but not slammed.  We ordered an tomato/mozzarella/basil app.  It was good.  We ordered sodas and if you believe they didn't have straws.  What eating facility runs out of straws?  I am handicapped and the glasses are a little to heavy for me so I asked if I could have a plastic kids cup for my drink.  She gave me a weird look even after explaining my situation.  Should have known it would go all down hill from there.  By the way never got the plastic cup. Ordered dinner.  My son ordered fish and chips and I ordered a hamburger.  I asked them to please make sure to have them to cook it to medium and plain/condiments on the side.  My son received his dinner followed by mine 5 minutes later.  Of course the burger came out almost burnt with it loaded with things.  I called her back when I found her about another 5 minutes later and told her I couldn't eat my dinner the way I received it.  She then asked me ""so does that mean you want me to have them redo the order.  I asked her to please do that.  Meanwhile my son is felling terrible and doesn't want to eat without me.  I told him to eat his while it was warm.   Ten to fifteen minutes later the food came out to me.  If you can believe it my fries were stone cold.  By then I have had enough.  I asked for the manager.  He came over and asked me what was wrong.  I explained all the things that went wrong and he said that he will go get me some fresh fries.  This is about 25-30 minutes after my son has received his meal. By then my son was finished with his meal.  They never asked if we would like a refill (remember I asked for a plastic cup). Well a couple of minutes later someone brought out the fries.  By that time you would think the manager/owner would bring them out himself and ask if he could do anything for us.   Nope - just dropped full pay check on table and ran in the back. My advice people.  Don't waste your time or money on this place.  Cedar Park now has a few more options so don't waste them here.

John M.,"Austin, TX",25,16,1,1.0,10/16/2016,"If there were an option for no stars, that's what this place would get. We've been to other locations and really enjoyed ourselves. If it weren't for our waiter (bless him, the poor guy,) there would have been nearly nothing positive about our experience. The manager who seated us offered a children's menu for our 19 month old, and then never brought one. We needed to order something on the fly for her so she wouldn't get upset, but no dice, thanks to him. The restaurant was mostly empty, but our food took forever to get out. I  ordered the late night burger, which was mostly ok, besides it clearly being cooked medium well, as opposed to the medium rare temp I ordered. Also, the bacon was undercooked. My wife's meal was the biggest disappointment. She ordered the barbacoa chicken (which, seriously? Barbacoa is beef cheek, but whatever...) Half of her rice was overcooked and mushy, and the other half was crunchy. It also had some kind of super salty cheese like feta on it, which tasted really unpleasant with the rest of the dish. The same manager came over and asked, ""Everything's great, right?"" Umm, no. We told him what was wrong and he seemed to not care. He first asked my wife if she'd ever actually had barbacoa before, and then he offered us something else, because, ""We actually do have good food in our kitchen, you know."" He then claimed he was going to talk to the kitchen about the rice, disappeared, and never came back. Our waiter told us it had been comped, which was appreciated. With multiple other locations in the area, there's really no reason to go back here. The table right next to us also got their food wrong, and from the reviews on here, this is a regular problem.

Went for a family dinner, at a decent time, they were not overly crowded or understaffed. We all placed our orders. My husband ordered a simple hamburger entree, no special requests. While most of our entrees came out in a timely manner, he didn't receive his until almost an hour and a half after we initially ordered, and most of us were already finished with our meals. He waited as he was very hungry and we kept being told by the server it would come out ""soon"" more than once.  The server assured us the kitchen had received his order when all of ours were submitted. After my husband finally got his meal, our server offered to have the manager come to our table to see if they could ""do something"". The manager came to the table, but offered no explanations, absolutely refused to take any action to rectify or make the situation right, and just seemed to shrug it off instead of offering any real apology.  My husband worked for many years in restaurants when he was younger. He knows how customer service SHOULD be in a restaurant. The other adult family members with us were appalled. We've all had experiences in restaurants where something wasn't right, and none of us could recount a time where a server or management didn't offer some way to compensate, such as taking something off the bill, a free beverage or desert, a voucher for a free appetizer in the future. This visit became the that first time.

The food is good; nothing special, but no complaints either.  It's a little pricey for what you get so you're paying for the chain-store-sports-bar atmosphere; lots of 60' flat screens around the wall..  I had the fish and chips (a pub standard) and the batter on the fish was heavy and rather oily.  They served a ""special hand made"" tartar sauce that didn't taste like tarter sauce at all.  That was a let down for me as I really like tartar sauce with my fish.  If they want to offer something different along with tarter sauce, that's fine.  But calling that stuff they had tarter sauce was a letdown.    The noise level was uncomfortable for me, and I'm kind of hard of hearing so I imagine it's really loud for most people.  There are about 16 Bose speakers (you know: No highs, no lows, it must be Bose) in the ceiling that are turned up louder than necessary, so everyone has to speak very loudly to their dinner partner & that just added to the noisy atmosphere.  All it lacked was the thick cloud of cigarette smoke hanging in the air of days gone by.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cedar-park?start=60

Courtney H.,"Cedar Park, TX",139,9,3,1.0,2/19/2016,"Disappointed.  I recently moved to Cedar Park and was happy to see a BJs Brewhouse nearby. The New Braunfels location has been a favorite of mine for years. However, my first visit to the CP location was a huge let-down.  We were seated quickly but waited 10 minutes for someone to greet our table and take a drink order.  The drinks were delivered another 10 minutes later. My glass of wine was covered in finger prints and hot pink lipstick; neither of which were mine. When the waiter returned, I asked for another glass. He commented that it was indeed gross and he'd be right back. Cool.  He brought an empty glass, placed it in front of me and left the table without a word. Now, if the glass is dirty, so is the wine inside. Pouring dirty wine into another glass does not make it clean.  When he finally returned notepad in hand, the kitchen was out of everything we requested. Alright... We settled on some other choices for an appetizer and dinner.  I still hadn't even taken a sip of my wine and the two glasses remained in the table as he had left them. After I mentioned it again, the waiter proceeded to pick up the small carafe of wine that accompanied the first glass and poured it into the empty glass. What?!?! That's your solution?!?! What about the rest of the pour still residing in the nasty glass? Our food was delivered and it was again 10 minutes or so until we saw our waiter. What if we needed something? Water refills? Silverware? (I walked to the hostess stand myself to get us some silverware.) I have to point out that my boyfriend and I both worked our way through college by waiting tables. After college, I worked as a corporate trainer for a national restaurant chain similar to BJs. We get it. My problem: countless servers and the manager passed us by several times throughout our visit; none offering assistance or checking on is. It was Saturday evening but not busy by normal standards. There were several open tables all over the restaurant. The waiter was full of excuses and lack-luster solutions. I don't want free wine; just clean wine. In my experience, dirty plates and/or glasses warrant an immediate replacement while removing the offensive dish or drink. Servers and managers help one another and take care of the patrons together if need be in order to provide a good experience. This was clearly not the practice at the CP BJs when we visited.  We paid our bill (wine included) and still tipped the waiter. I hope he was new; there may still be hope for him to learn. I doubt we will visit BJs again with far better service and products offered elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cedar-park?start=60

Pamela B.,"Georgetown, TX",0,2,,1.0,10/6/2017,"The man who was the daytime manager today, October 6, 2017, needs to find another line of work. It took 25 minutes for our party of five to be seated, even though the restaurant was half empty. They claimed that there was no server available in the area where all the tables were open, yet I see the manager standing around, drinking a smoothie, talking to several servers and hostesses (who were also using their cell phones). He was not expediting or helping with anything, not directing his employees to seat people more quickly during lunch, just chatting away and standing around like a lazy lump. It's so sad for me to see the way these millennials have no work ethic, and to have a manager (who was probably around 45 years old) just stand around with them, setting a terrible example, is infuriating. I will never eat here again, and I truly expect this restaurant to be closed within the next year, because this is the third not-so-great experience I've had at the same location, and they're obviously not changing anything.

While I would love to eat sushi everyday or enjoy dinners with multiple fancy meticulously plated cuisine there are some days I just want to keep it simple. BJ's fits that bill.  There is wine for me and lots of beer options for Jesse. They brew their own beers and they also serve a nice selection of taps from other breweries. The best day stop in for wine is Tuesdays when bottles and wines by the glass are 1/2 off. They don't have a huge selection of high end wines but you can get drinkable glasses starting at $5 during happy hour. At the other locations I have been to I usually get my carb fix with either the mini veggie deep dish or flat bread pizza discounted during happy hour. Tonight we dined at this newly opened Cedar Park location and were happy to find lots of parking behind the restaurant. We were promptly greeted and taken care of well at the bar by Kelly and Michael. I had a glass of wine and tried their kale salad with roasted Brussels sprouts. I was impressed how flavorful this salad is! The large green salad was tossed in a strawberry vinaigrette and had fresh blueberries, dried cranberries, a little bit of goat cheese, red grapes, candied pecans and toasted pepitas. The salad is off the ""EnLIGHTENed"" menu, is 410 calories and you have the option to add a protein.  This will be a great place to watch sports games or to happy hour in this area of Cedar Park.

Kimberly B.,"Austin, TX",39,10,,1.0,11/7/2015,"Today we gave the Cedar Park location a second chance.  On our first visit a month or so ago, I had to ask for at least 6 different sets of silverware because they were dirty. I was told that there was a problem with their water softener or something so it was just hard water making the silverware look dirty.  When I pointed out the food stuck to the fork the hostess wasn't even phased. The service was slow and the food was just disappointing.   Today's visit started with the hostess being a bit snarky, the server being clueless, and the food being just terrible.  I mean seriously, for the prices this place charges management really needs to get their act together!! To start with, I ordered a sweet tea to drink. When the server returned with my drink I was notified that they were out of sweet tea, so he brought me a glass of unsweetened tea that was so weak you could barely tell it was tea.  I guess nobody in the building knew how to make sweet tea because in the hour or so we were there none was ever made, and when I got a refill, it was the same disgusting watered down weak unsweetened tea.  I always get the balsamic chicken breast that comes with assorted green leaf lettuce, mashed potatoes, fried onion straws and carmelized onions.   When I ordered my food, I asked for no carmelized onions on my meal, but stated the fried onion straws were ok; the waiter just wrote down ""no onions"", so it wasn't a big surprise when my food came out sans fried onion straws.  What was a surprise was the fact that the green leaf lettuce on my plate was replaced with a crappy romaine mix that was nothing but a bunch of wilted romaine and spines that I hate.  The chicken breasts tasted like frozen, pressed chicken that had been microwaved, slapped on the grill and drowned in balsamic glaze to cover it up. I've been to both the Round Rock and North Austin locations and the service was incredible, the food consistently good, and the experience overall pleasant.  This Cedar Park location has some serious work to do.  The staff just seem like they couldn't really care less.  I will not waste my time or money going back to this location.

Almost to many options, so it took us a while to decide what to get. We settled on calamari for the appetizer, one mountain and a hot tea to drink. The calamari was beautifully played and look way better then it tasted. The problem was that the dish seemed to not be seasoned. I took a drink of my hot tea and quickly picked up on a Tim flavor that I could not get out of my mouth. It was so bad I sent my hot tea back and ordered a soft drink. After a small wait our main dishes arrived. Both meals looked great so we could not wait to try them. Yet again we were disappointed. My dish the parmesan crusted chicken with veggies seemed very under seasoned. My teenaged daughter told me she found her shrimp tacos to be way to salty.

I did get the bill adjusted. My mother's salad ingredients were under seasoned (even for a salad/it was the Santa Fe salad) and my husband's burger (jalapeño) was bland. While our waitstaff was nice, the overall staff seemed hurried (it was not busy), irritated by questions or in the case of the manager on duty, comment-less regarding the dish error.

My boyfriend and I used to be regulars here (probably twice a week) for a few months but things just kept getting worse and worse. The food used to be good, but it's turned very inconsistent. Ingredients missing from dishes, sloppy presentation, cold. The greeters at the front are NEVER friendly. Not once. Very mean glares when we walk in since day one. There was a day where I even almost had to ask our waiter if we could be moved because the one who is always there in the afternoon would not stop glaring at me. She's always there when we like to eat (around 2-4pm) so we started trying to come later in the day to avoid her. We never leave less than $20 tips, we clean up after ourselves, we laugh with the rest of the staff, so I'm not sure what's eating the dolls at the front. I really do miss going here. Maybe when my boyfriend gets back from visiting family in Australia they will have re hired new staff for the front.

Lacey P.,"Austin, TX",35,306,95,2.0,10/13/2014,"I agree with the other reviewers... Terrible Service - we were seated quickly and brought drinks in average time.  After we ordered fish tacos & half sandwich/soup combo it took 35 minutes to get our food.  Our server seated 2 cops (and others) after us and they all got their food before us.  I would understand if it was a well done steak/burger order but our entree items were easy.  Also took a long time to get a drink refill.  Will never come back at lunch time again.  There was a good crowd there but it was definitely not packed by any means.  Waiter's only excuse was he had a big table before us.  Weird since the 2 cops got their food easily enough. FREEZING - it was so cold I could not wait to leave.  I was wearing jeans, boots, & long sleeve sweater and I was still so cold my nose was starting to run.  Not exaggerating at all it had to be at least 67 degrees if not colder.  Even my husband was cold who is NEVER cold. Two Stars because the food was tasty.  If we finally do venture back it will be at dinner time so we are prepared for a 2 hour meal with a winter coat on to survive the frosty cold atmosphere. Other BJ's have the same great food, highly recommend pizookie and avocado egg rolls. Notes:  has TVs so good for game watching, good beer selections, full bar, take out available.  We called the manager to let him know the issues and he recommended the take out option if you are in a hurry (sounds like being slow is a common issue) also he did apologize for the bad service and said it would be addressed ASAP.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cedar-park?start=100

Rachael W.,"Hutto, TX",0,9,1,4.0,3/15/2015,"This was my first visit to a BJ's and my first impression overall was a good one. The wait staff and hostesses were friendly and attentive. The menu has a good deal of variety, so finding something for everyone in a group is practically guaranteed. Looking around our table, everything looked really good, which makes me want to go back and try some of those dishes.  I had the Asian Chopped Salad and was completely delighted. It was the perfect meal portion - plenty to fill me up and not waste uneaten salad, which often happens when most restaurants serve ridiculously large salads that must be eaten or thrown out, since salads do not make good leftovers.  This salad was a beautifully crafted medley of veggies, mandarin oranges, sesame seeds and cilantro and a generous serving of grilled chicken, all tossed in a delicate honey ginger dressing and topped with crispy wonton strips. What I loved about the dressing is that it was the perfect blend of sweet and tangy and did not coat everything, so the fresh flavor of the other ingredients came shining through.  The only downside I would mention is that it took a while for the meal to arrive once we had ordered. I attribute this to the kitchen and not the wait staff, who did a great job. Slow service is something I am willing to overlook the first time, and I will be back to try some of the other dishes. That said, if this proves to be a pattern, I may not be so quick to return again after that.

John D.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,28,1,4.0,1/2/2015,"I 1st went to Cedar Park BJ's a few weeks back for a late lunch. Ate off the reasonably priced lunch menu and got the Southern Fried Chicken which is a breaded and fried chicken breast fillet. It sat on top of a pile of mashed potatoes surrounded by cut corn kernels. Gravy was spooned over the top. Long story short: it transported me back to the 1960's to fond memories of my mom's very similar dinners (except she didn't serve me a top notch pint of beer). Chicken breast fillets are easily dried out but this one was on-the-mark moist. The seasoning and flavors were also aligned with my tastes. Portion size was a good fit for lunch. A thumbs up. I invited my wife to BJ's for lunch today and we had an equally pleasant experience. This time we started with a calamari appetizer and found it and the two dipping sauces delicious. My wife ordered the same chicken dish I had before and said she also was happily pulled back to memories of her mom's cooking. I had the lunch special BBQ platter with a pulled pork slider, a BBQ chicken breast fillet, skinny fries, a dab of coleslaw and BBQ sauce. It was all good. The breast fillet was just as moist as the fried version had been previously. Good job! That was the food and now for the service. The shortest way to say it is that the greeting hostesses, bartenders, waitpersons, buspersons and ""managerial"" staff all came across as warm blooded humans with developed personalities. The only con is that the wait for the food/drinks seemed a bit long. I am more than willing to trade that for the quality of the food and friendliness of the staff.

John W.,"Leander, TX",0,4,,1.0,12/8/2014,"First let me clarify that I typically enjoy this chain...That being said when they were planning on opening in Cedar Park I was quite excited. We waited until it had been open a few weeks before stopping in. Our first experience was on a Friday and we just wanted apps and drinks so we chose to sit at the bar. The service from the bar staff is awful. Not focused on guests and just worried about the side-work or each other. Two of the bartenders came across so arrogant towards us as well as a couple next to us. There were young children sitting at the bar with their mom so we were not impressed by that either. We received cold calamari and after a few bites we just asked for the check and left- NOT HAPPY Well we blew off the first visit and decided to give it another try. This was last Saturday 12-6-14 around 4-5pm. We could beat the crowds and enjoy some apps and drinks. We sat ourselves in the bar table area as instructed by the hostess. We sat their for 5 minutes without anyone greeting us even though the waitress served the table right next to us and certainly glanced at our empty table top. We finally were greeted by a spastic female server who seemed extremely overwhelmed with a two table section. Our drinks came out fine and then we waited for her to come back to get our food order....never happened so we just got our tab and walked out.  The icing on the cake took place as we were leaving. I walked up to the hostess stand where a young male manager was standing and requested a comment card...he looked at me very puzzled  (as if he did not understand what a comment card was), he looked around and said they did not really have any cards...I continued to look at him and told him I would find away to leave a comment.....his reply; ""Oh OK, "" Really??? ...The cool thing about restaurants is that customers ""vote"" with their feet!! I will not be going back to CP BJ's again. So disappointed in the service, the hospitality, and the carelessness of the inexperienced management team.

Lachelle S.,"Cedar Park, TX",78,16,,5.0,6/30/2015,"I had a fantastic experience when I went to BJs in Cedar Park. In California, I frequented a BJs that was across the street from where I worked and it was always great. My expectations were high but the BJs Pizza in Cedar Park did not disappoint. I was seated promptly and my food came quickly. I ordered the Stuffed Mushrooms and a Fresh Watermelon and Feta salad that was wonderful. I definitely recommend this place for dinner with the family or a night out with friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cedar-park?start=140

V. K.,"Cedar Park, TX",3,4,,1.0,6/7/2015,"My family and I have been regulars here since they opened. The food has been good however they have a recurring issue with having dirty dishes/silverware being brought to the table. I have spoken to a manager each time this has happened and they assure me that it will be taken care of.  We went in again last night and ordered pizza. The waitress brought us plates, all of which had red sauce all over them. Clearly they had not been washed from the previous person that used them. Again we asked for clean dishes. I wonder what their kitchen looks like.  And this morning 2 of my family members woke up with food poisoning.

I got the BJ's Special deep dish pizza...nothing special there. Hubs got the garlic parm wings which he said were good but then got a stomach ache later bc they were so greasy. Today's visit is probably the last time I'll go there. I'll just have to buy the hubs a kegerator with Guinness on tap.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cedar-park?start=140

Mrs. M.,"Austin, TX",0,82,4,5.0,5/9/2015,"Everything about our experience today was 5-star.  We came here to celebrate Mother's Day with my mom and 3 girls and received nothing short of excellent service.  Upon arriving, we were seated immediately and our drink orders taken promptly.  I wish I knew the name of our server--he was very friendly and on top of his game the whole time.  When asked about substitutions, he was very accommodating, and not only did he not make it seem like a hassle to swap out sides, but he was more than happy to do it for us.  Both my mom and I had the Mediterranean pita tacos with tomato mozzarella salads, and everything was fresh, flavorful and filling.  The kids all enjoyed their meals as well.  Prices were really great for the food quality.  I love their premier rewards program and the free pizookie we got for Mother's Day.  Four of us could easily share it, and it was delicious!  Overall, I am very happy we chose to come here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cedar-park?start=140
Mary S.,"Cedar Park, TX",182,53,5,2.0,2/28/2015,"Today my hubby and I visited for lunch and it was quite busy (typical for Saturday lunch) but there was a booth available and when we asked the lady taking us to the table if we could have the booth versus a tiny table for 2 sandwiched up against another table (with a 1/2 wall dividing us from the people next to us) and people in front of us and behind us like sardines.  She said no, I think she (hostess) is planning to give it to the party that came in behind you.  Did I hear that right?  We came in ten minutes before those people and they get the booth with plenty of room?  It didn't sit well with either of us and we almost walked out... but we proceeded to order.  The service was mediocre and it took three people to get us the following:  (waitress) 1 beer, 1 water (server) our order of chili fries and shrimp tacos (manager) our check.  The food was pretty average, so I would maybe give it three stars.  I did like the fact that the chips that came out with my tacos were actually warmed up and not served cold but to be honest, my own shrimp tacos actually murder theirs and I was really disappointed when I asked for guacamole and was told they don't have any???

Andy M.,"Leander, TX",230,3,,2.0,2/13/2015,"Walked in tonight and had the New York Steak. The waiter was very good, very on top of things and very enthusiastic. So far so good! Got my side salad, very good! I then receive my main course, the steak with fries. The steak however, was absolutely AWFUL. The meat had tons of ligaments/ veins which made it almost impossible to cut and let alone chew. On top of this, it was severely undercooked and to top it all off, the meat tasted like it wasn't seasoned at all! It the surface was charred as well. It was like eating squishy, bland  charcoal. My friend who was accompanying me also had the same problem. Just awful steaks. We let the manager know and he was very professional about it and got the situation handled. I'm not sure if they're usually like this, but I think they need to invest in some higher quality meat cuts. The fries that came with the steak were delicious, of course it's hard to screw that up. Overall, I may come back, I may not. Still undecided.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cedar-park?start=160
Shea H.,"Round Rock, TX",2,5,,1.0,1/15/2015,"Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! We had our managers meeting here last night. We were seated very quickly, however, that was the only good experience about this place. We ordered our drinks and 2 apps. We all received our drinks fairly quickly, minus one beer that we waited 15 mins for and got told about 3 times that it was on it's way out. We ordered our food, took over 45 to get, all while the other tables around us were receiving and eating their food and had been seated after us. We all got our food, minus one taco that was supposed to be shrimp and they brought out fish, Very plain...In the meantime, our waters are empty and have been for about 20 mins and nobody stopped to ask if we needed any. Missing taco comes out about 10 mins later and it's the SAME fish taco they brought out before. Ridiculous. They finally bring out the shrimp taco when we are done with our food and it's raw!! Awful...we complain to our waitress, who is as ditzy as they come and doesn't know why the wrong taco keeps coming out (while we overhear another waitress tell her she input it wrong (TWICE). ) We ask for complimentary dessert for the awful service and she tells us the manager will comp 2 desserts because of our experience. We wait another 20 mins and get 1 of the 2 desserts that was to be comped. Again, she doesn't know why the other dessert wasn't put in or brought out. At this point we don't even want to wait for the other one so we ask for our bill that includes BOTH desserts on it and have them credited. Couldn't get out of here fast enough!! Seriously hope they work on the service, food and management of this place. LOVE the RR location and will stick to that one!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cedar-park?start=160
Bill S.,"Austin, TX",0,3,,1.0,10/29/2014,"The service is terrible.  The meal consumed two hours of our time that we can never get back.  This was for plain old simple hamburgers.  Our experience was agonizing.  I won't belabor you with all the gory details and maybe time and experience will improve the service.  The hamburgers were ok, but just average, and certainly not worth suffering the miserable service.  Probably the worst service I have ever experienced and to add insult to injury, the checks were all wrong and had extensive errors.  All for four hamburgers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cedar-park?start=160
Holly L.,"Round Rock, TX",28,14,,2.0,11/15/2014,"Have visited this location twice now.  First time was right after they opened.  I went with my two children.  We ordered two kids meals and a house salad.  1 hour and 20 minutes later we left.  I chalked up the terribly slow service to them being relatively new and still needing to work out the kinks.  Gave them a second chance tonight.  Arrived at 4:45 and asked to a table for 7.  They said it would take just a couple minutes to set up a table.  The restaurant wasn't even busy yet.  30 minutes later we were seated.  Given my last experience here, I explained to the waiter we needed to be done by 6:30.  One hour later, we were finally served our food minus one meal.  They completely forgot one of the dinners.  We ended up leaving shortly after 6:30 without finishing our meals.  If you're in the mood for BJs, go to the Round Rock or Arbor Walk locations. Service at both locations is miles ahead of the Cedar Park location. There are plenty of other choices in the area unless you're in the mood for a 2 hour dinner at a chain restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cedar-park?start=160
Larry S.,"Dallas, TX",0,3,,3.0,11/11/2014,Food is great. The only way to get through lunch in an hour is to order your drink and food at the same time and then ask for the check as soon as your food is brought to the table. This is a failing of every BJ's we've been to.

Rob C.,"Georgetown, TX",0,7,,1.0,3/26/2015,"New location opened less than 6 months ago. Good atmosphere and food (salad is supreme), and this was our first time visiting not only this location but BJ's overall. My son was in town from Colorado and we went out for a late dinner. Unfortunately he left his sunglasses on the table. When we realized the error, the store was closed. Returned the next morning and was told the sunglasses were not turned in. This was an $80 pair of Oakley's that were taken- presumably by staff. Unlikely to be another customer since (1) staff cleans the table during and after the meal, and (2) more than likely there were no more customers arriving when we left since it was nearing close of business. Honesty is a virtue. Loyalty is earned and when trust is broken, it doesn't matter how good a business product is; you only have one chance to prove your business virtue. Unfortunately, employees may not have the same values, but there is a responsibility element involved. Unfortunately, I will not be patronizing BJ's Whitestone Cedar Park, nor any other location including Colorado, as a result of this experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cedar-park?start=160
Richard E.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,184,,2.0,9/7/2015,"Very disappointed with the blonde waitress in the bar area.  My wife and I went last week, dropped about $80 on beers and my wife had the shrimp w/ pasta dinner.  Get to that in a minute.   The blonde serving us, I think her name was Jessie - she spent more time hanging out with her table of friends than serving drinks to the customers in her area.   The kicker is is that another gal, who was more on top of her game, had to take up the slack and picked up half her tables.  Again, the little blonde was to busy acting cool and hip than servicing her tables.   I tipped the other gal who took over as she did the job.  As far as dinner?   You talk about water in the bottom of the pasta / shrimp dish?  You knew it was frozen from the onset and should have been drained.  The positive, the Dunkel is good beer.  Probably the best on tap.  For what we paid and the lack of service -not sure if we go back.  My wife did like the atmosphere though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cedar-park?start=160
Jason B.,"Austin, TX",1,3,3,4.0,12/5/2014,"Ate dinner here tonight. Though it was busy, we took a quick seat at a table in the bar area. No wait at all. Was greeted by our server quickly. She was friendly though odd. She liked to linger at our table and over exaggerate everything. But, she was very attentive and responsive. We ordered a deep dish pizza although it's not really deep dish. Just really thick crust. A true deep dish has the toppings baked inside of the pizza so that was a bit misleading. The food was delicious none the less. At our waitress's recommendation, we had the new Pepperoni pizza dip. It was delicious. My girlfriend and I both had one drink. I had a strawberry sangria, which wasn't very tasty, and my girlfriend had the frozen strawberry margarita. Her drink tasted much better and had lots of tequila in it. My sangria appeared to be watered down. We shared a large pazookie which was delicious. All in all it was a pleasant experience.

I know that prices are set based on demographics. That's understood. But as consumers,  we like to get what we pay for. I visited Bjs last night. Service was great, food was great, food prices ok, alcohol prices, holy crap. Thought I was at Ruth Cris. I ordered a shot of Gran Mariner. $8.50 for a 1 OUNCE SHOT! really? $6.25 for a pint of Fat tire? I'm not a yuppie,  but you don't serve cordials in a false shot glass, maybe a snifter,  or high ball you think? I currently work in the service industry,  and I know what the whole sale price is on that bottle, as well as keg price for Tire. Bjs, you need to re-think your prices. It's a little ridiculous. I know all businesses are in business to make money, I won't be back, at least not for drinks.
