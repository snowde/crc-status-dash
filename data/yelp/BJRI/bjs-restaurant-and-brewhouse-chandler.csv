Makesha F.,"Phoenix, AZ",71,13,1,3.0,9/7/2017,"This was my first time coming to a BJs in Arizona, it was okay. The food was pretty good, I had the avocado rolls and the Peruvian Shrimp Quinoa Bowl. Oh let me just state, the water is disgusting it's tastes like dirt therefore I would recommend a Pellegrino.  The service was good, our servers name was Steve and he was a delight making our experience better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chandler?start=20
Lily L.,"Chandler, AZ",26,64,,4.0,8/19/2017,"I'm not usually a fan chain restaurants, but BJ's does a pretty good job of making you forget your are at one. The menu can be overwhelming but the food is consistently good and the service is attentive. I think some of the prices are ridiculously expensive  ,like who would pay $16 for spaghetti,  but I don't blame this location. In summary, the food and service is good and the menu offers a nice variety.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chandler?start=20

They said they would do their best to seat us in 20 minutes​. 50 minutes later (7pm) my soon was hungry. I asked for a manager and explained what happened she said she would seat us right away and get us a free appetizer.  I have a food allergies and appetizers are hard for my diet. The manager said she would see what else she could do.  When the waiter came by he was amazing. He let me ""create"" a sandwich that was not even on the menu to meet my allergies. It was delicious. He then came back and told me our whole meal was comped and wished me a happy Mother's Day!

We had a party of 9 -served by Jessica; she was outstanding! Had the lettuce wraps, fresh , crispy leaves of lettuce served with a Asian chicken mixture: accompanied by a side of hot mustard & teriyaki sauce! Really good, wonderful light meal. Pizza (6 sliced/ med) Pepperoni & had them add fresh garlic and basil. BBQ chopped chicken salad was piled high to perfection! Caesar salad was a generous portion for a main meal.

We went there for a late lunch, and it was pretty busy. They seated us as fast as they could, and the service was very good. They even gave us a free glass and a gift card for a follow up visit just because it was Father's day. The food was good, but the only thing that doesn't make it into the 5 star range is the fact that the food didn't absolutely wow us.

Cali F.,"Mesa, AZ",444,124,112,5.0,2/16/2017,"Came here with a friend yestarday to grab a bite to eat for lunch. The atmosphere was dim lighting, cozy type of feeling.  I was promptly greeted by their hostess and escorted to my both. My waitress was there with in minutes and brought our of waters with in minutes. We wornt sure what to get for a appetizer so we asked the waitress what she would recommend. She suggested the avocado spring we went with her suggestion. They were pretty tasty. What ever the sause that they gave you for the dip was amazing. You literally could drink it tasted so good jkkk. My friend ordered there bacon guacamole cheese burger and subbed the french fries for a soup. She really cheeseburger phenomenal. I took a bite of the burger and it was pretty good. I ordered their California club sandwich at the recommendation of the Waitress and sub the Fry's for there Caesar salad. I was surprised at how big the saled was I couldn't even finish it. The sandwich was very good chicken with season  perfectly . Good portions I would only eat half of it. For dessert we ordered there mint Pizookie which was phenomena.  The only done side was we waited forever to get out desert. Waited way longer then we should have. We did not mention this to our server.

Vladmir T.,"Scottsdale, AZ",1248,835,1448,4.0,5/5/2016,My impression of BJs is that many of my guy friends love to meet here for pizza and beers when I am in town...  The pizza is good.

Brian R.,"Saint Louis, MO",84,245,773,4.0,10/22/2016,"BJs, for a chain, is quite good. This location is at the Chandler Mall, so it can get busy during peak dining and shopping hours. As a local brewery, they have a huge bar, and you can see the brewery tanks  in the restaurant as you eat.  The waiter was friendly and patient with us, as we took awhile to decide on our entrees. He was attentive during the meal. The pub/bar food is actually good, unlike some breweries that have great beer but only mediocre food. I had the double burger loaded with onions, cheese, a house made bun, and a side of onion strings. They cooked the burger medium as requested, and it was well seasoned with the proper amount of juiciness. The onion strings were amazing! For dessert, their chocolate chip pizookie is the best. A soft baked 6-7 inch deep dish cookie topped with ice cream and whipped cream.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chandler?start=20

Kat P.,"Mesa, AZ",68,188,377,3.0,3/19/2016,"BJ's Brewhouse Chandler is located at the mall. We met some friends here for dinner on their suggestion.  Being at the mall during spring break is not my idea of a good time, so there's that. Parking was a nightmare. Wait time was very short, and the restaurant itself was busy but not too loud.    was great. We started with calamari and salads. The calamari was very salty, but was cooked well, so as not to be rubbery. The Caesar salad was great.  Before the main course,  I ran out of water. Where's the server? Who knows. Eventually I see her and beg for some. The entrees arrive with perfect timing. Our friends order jumbalaya and the shrimp asparagus penne. I also chose the penne, and my husband the Mahi Mahi with shrimp on couscous. He really enjoyed his meal, as did I.  Then, I ran out of water. I steal my husband's. I run out of his water. I don't see the server until everyone is dine and she offers the dessert menu. I drink my water refill in one second flat. We're not quite ready for dessert, bit are chatting and randomly glancing at the menu. For all the mad - dogging and dessert preasure, you'd think that I could get a flippin' glass of water! We eventually order the Pizookie trio, sampling the macadamia nut,  Ghirardelli triple chocolate and the salted caramel. Holy chocolate balls these were good!   And then I ran out of water. She drops the check before the dessert comes. Some other dude brings dessert. She promptly collects the check and we never see her again. I have imbibed everyone's water. The server was nice enough, but seemed more intent on rushing us through, maybe to get off in time? I'm not a pain in the butt, and I've been a server, so I'm polite, not needy, and tip really well, so I don't think watching the beverages of your tables is too much to ask. And then...the restroom. Going into the restroom felt like a transporter into a bus station bathroom...in Mexico. It was beyond gross. One stall was locked but appeared empty. A staff member had locked herself in another and was on the phone professing her love to her man in Spanish. That left the hc stall. Feces covering the toilet seat, toilet paper everywhere like a bomb went off...just gross.  My husband said that the men's room was worse. He said that is was flooded from a toilet and also in severe disarray. While we enjoyed our food and company, we will not likely come back. They need to do some major examination of cleanliness and service practices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chandler?start=20
Clifford S.,"Phoenix, AZ",12,35,2,3.0,6/30/2017,First time here and it was interesting. Spent ten minutes waiting for three different hostesses to find a table for me to sit at. There was practically nobody in the place. Food was good. Service was mediocre at best. Don't come here thirsty. They don't give refills even though the menu says free refills.

Lisett V.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,3,,5.0,10/29/2016,"My  husband and I have been a customer for many years. My recent experience was above and beyond. We typically always receive excellent service from Tracy at the bar,but I had to reach out to express my gratitude to the Manager David Renish! Under the direction of David Renish the Senior Manager, one of his team members brought to his attention that we dropped some cash on the floor and were unaware of it until the next day. David Renish called me and texted us that night to let us know that he found it and was going to hold it for us until we were able to visit again.   The genuineness of the team to let the manager know that we dropped cash and did not keep it, is just another reason why we will be loyal customers of BJ's.

Kenny O.,"Odessa, TX",24,71,124,4.0,5/22/2017,"Important points, good food, fair service. Our server was very attentive, refills on drinks, fast calamari-hot crispy..good.  It took 6-minutes.  She was the perfect server, but stuck with looking bad because food takes longer.  BJ management can see on the food tickets on how long the food takes.  Get with it guys,  BJ's has a menu unmatched but service has always been a tad challenging.  We sat on a Sunday.  the wait was 10-15, and we got in in 10.  That's good.  Religiously, the food takes a while, but a quality product take time.  it shouldn't take 25-mites for a lunch.  Just think if you have a 1/2-hr for lunch I would not go here. BJ's consistently takes longer.   They can improve, but my past 5-years of eats has shown otherwise.  Dinners are 28-32-minute wait, great quality, and the TV's are what can help pass the time.  I hate to sound racist but, my 15-years of food service industry, I'd hire Hispanic cooks.  You can bet if you go to any restaurant and there are Hispanic folks cooking, it will get to you fast.  It will be quality food. We had a hand battered chicken strips, very good.  The green chili burger was thick, hot and tasty.  Not real juicy, cooked well done, but I had a bite it was good.  I had the Asian salad, which was great, with the crunchy won ton skins mmm good.  My son got the pepperoni deep dish, which is just like Gino's East in Chicago...amazing.   This is why I gave this place 4-stars.  If they can serve their lunches in 15-minutes, and dinners in 18, then they'd be a hit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chandler?start=20

Jon R.,"Mesa, AZ",33,67,4,5.0,1/10/2018,"A staple of Chandler Fashion Center and my go-to for going out to eat. I have frequented this restaurant more than most people have, and have yet to have a bad experience. Honestly, it is hard to go wrong ordering anything off of the menu, but there are a few things which I highly recommend: the avacado rolls (warm, fried, slightly spicy, and a little messy), tortilla soup, ANY of the beers, the flat bread pizza, any of the burgers, ribs, french dip, and the pastas. This place is huge, so I have never had to wait long for a table. I would advise making a reservation ahead of time to skip the line (if there is one). It is also located close to the mall, so this place is a good stop for lunch or dinner (or both)! Great for groups and company outings. There is outside seating which is very pleasant throughout most of the year in AZ. Try the Red or the Porter as those are my favorites!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chandler

Jacky C.,"Tucson, AZ",242,57,108,1.0,10/16/2017,"STAY AWAY! If you're debating between a few restaurants and this is one of your options, you can cross BJ's off your list and I'm sure you won't regret it.  My family took my bf here for his birthday.  We were seated immediately and the server came over in a timely manner. He had no knowledge of the menu- he kept offering items that were not even on the menu and then saying ""Oh sorry never mind you can't get that"".  The food was mediocre at best.. rib eye, mahi-mahi tacos, chicken sandwich were all overpriced and it seemed like the quality was not what it used to be- More bland than it was flavorful.  Anything we requested from our server, such as an extra ranch or drink refill, were forgotten about.  The server ID'd my bf when he ordered a beer and noted that it was his birthday the day before our visit, but forgot it when it was time for dessert and we had to remind him.  We ordered a white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie. The server informed us, to my bf's disappointment, that they were out of vanilla ice cream and will have to give us chocolate instead. My bf is not a fan of chocolate (what a weirdo, right) and passed on the pizookie but they brought out the cookie anyway. About 5-10 mins later, we see dessert plates being brought out with VANILLA ICE CREAM. I guess they restocked but we were not informed, received no apology and the server had made no effort to make things right.  To top off our amazing experience, my bf, my sister and I ended up in and out of the restroom all night from 2 in the morning til now thanks to the mahi-mahi tacos we decided to try. If I had to diagnose that, I'm going to guess that we've got food poisoning.  I called the manager on duty this morning to explain everything that had happened to her and she had no sympathy or desire to make things right.  Don't waste your time or your money! There are sooo many other options than a place that has no respect for your needs or your time. You. Deserve. Better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chandler

You would think when you are serving so close to your managers or leads that you would be working better to show your strengths but this was terrible. She not once ever refilled my water even after asking and putting it out for her to see. She never once looked at how I never touched my Awful margarita and said hey I noticed you haven't touched your margarita is everything okay? Nope not once. My fiancé asked for a side of ranch and we definitely never got that either. I seriously couldn't believe how little this server cared. Definitely will not be back anytime soon.

Shawna A.,"Chandler, AZ",0,9,,1.0,11/30/2017,"BJs was a place that my husband and I frequently would visit, mainly due to the late hours they have. We routinely pick up food from here and have given this restaurant multiple chances after they CONSTANTLY mess up our orders and finally, enough is enough, and I can't see a time when we're coming back. Back on Veternan's Day my husband and I picked up food to go; my order was severely messed up (missing toppings, wrong side), and I called the restaurant to let them know. The worker was apologetic and said we would get refunded; I gave our card number that it was purchased on and three weeks later, still no refund. Obviously, refunds don't take that long so we went back into the restaurant to ask about the refund. While we waited for a manager, one of the chefs came out and discussed how ""crazy"" the restaurant was and busy on Veteran's Day, and they messed up a lot of orders. I chuckled inside because I was thinking, first of all, a restaurant should be prepared to deal with demand, secondly; you mess up our orders all the time. Eventually, the manager came out who really seems to be like a nice guy; we have talked to him several times due to the multiple times our orders are botched. He offered us either our money back or a $25 gift card, so we accepted the gift card and left. Later, we wanted to grab dinner, so I ordered food from BJ's on their application. I ordered a sandwich and a turkey burger and within minutes my cell phone rang, it was BJs saying the order had come through as a large pizza and that the cooks in the back thought it was odd that a pizza had mayo on it, so they figured something had happened. What was confusing is the fact that they assumed it was a pizza, but they said all the customizations we added to our order were visible. My husband made sure they could see all of our customizations, asked about them, and they said they had the order correct, and it would be ready for pick-up shortly. When my husband went to pick up our order, after being in there for 20 minutes or so, he saw the turkey burger had a side salad with it. He questioned the worker saying that wasn't right, and she argued that the turkey burger comes with a side salad WITHOUT dressing. He said I know, but my wife changed her side to fries (why would you argue and what is the point of customizing an order if they can't get it right?). My husband then was obviously skeptical that the rest of the order was right, and he asked if the turkey burger had onions on it (I love onions and previously when I ordered the turkey burger they left onions off, which is stupid because one of the toppings it comes with IS onions), the worker replied that onions were on it because it comes on it. Well, thankfully my hubby is smart or just knows how bad they are, so he asked for some onions on the side. Anyway, we get home; I go to look at the toppings on my turkey burger and sure enough -- no onions. I could go on and on about all the times that they have messed up our order, and even though we had a gift card, we still paid too much for service and food like this. One other example, one time we placed a take-out order and ordered a specific pizookie - the restaurant wasn't able to see what flavor pizookie we wanted, and what flavors of ice cream, so instead of calling us, they gave us whatever they wanted (are you kidding? Prices are way too high for this kind of service). We are very loyal customers, and we won't be coming back anytime soon. Something with the way this restaurant runs is severely broken and obviously nothing is fixing it. The sad part is this was our first time being back since they messed up our previous order, and here they go again getting it wrong. It is sad that places like McDonald's mess up my order a lot less than a place that is much more expensive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chandler

Enjoyed some wine and our food came.  It was amazing tell my sisters order came out.   She told the waitress clearly no no chicken.  She only eats seafood.  So she orders a shrimp salad. And got a chicken salad.    We had to complain 2 times. Normally love eating here.  They have us 2 free deserts for our large table.  That's what saved the rating.  It would have been a 2 star.    We will be back again,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chandler?start=40

I came in with 12 people about two hours till closing time and expected the staff to be a bit salty, but they were anything but. Our waitress came in clutch and scored us a nice spot that accommodated everyone - she was super friendly.  Next, David (who I assume is the manager) came in and swept us away. He greeted us in a warm manner and made us feel very welcome. Our appetizers came out quickly and were fuckin' excellent. I swear those mozzarella sticks multiply when you're not looking. The potato skins were amazing, too. We never had to ask for our drinks to be refilled, never had to check if our order was put in correctly, never had to complain - everything was wonderful. When it came time to split the check, things got kind of hairy because we wanted to split one giant ass pizzookie twelve ways - but David was like ""I got you, fam,"" and split that shit up like it was no one's damn business. He was such a sweetheart. The guy taking our cards at the end was hilarious and had a wonderful sense of humor.

Margo L.,"Tempe, AZ",121,28,1,2.0,7/29/2017,"This was my third visit to this location and my boyfriend and I were dissatisfied to say the least. This time around my deep dish pizza came out on a plate, not in the pan, and the bottom was completely mutilated. Once again I was brought nothing to separate the pizza so my fork and butter knife had to suffice. We ordered a pizookie trio, and they brought out the wrong flavor. I told our waiter, (who was awesome by the way) and he brought out another one right away. Which yet again was the incorrect flavor. The manager on duty came by our table to ask about our experience and I told her what happened. She proceeded to attempt to argue with me about what flavor the second pizookie was then quickly walked away and came back with our check. They ended up comping our meal because they goofed up. The first time we came to this location we had a similar experience. Awesome server yet again, but the kitchen staff just couldn't get it right. The food runners brought our food to the wrong table both times, and failed to bring anything to but the pizza with. The first time around we waited an extremely long time for our food to arrive and the restaurant was completely dead.

Delightful they were (albeit a bit smaller compared to others) but they were indeed delicious. The problem, however, had everything to do with our experience outside of dessert.  The service was slow, and minimal at best. We waited quite a while to get seated in a nearly empty restaurant, only to eventually seat ourselves. We then waited some more before somebody finally took notice to help us. And then waited some more (a ton more) for them to take our order and eventually bring our food. We realized that during the wait happy hour had kicked in, so we ordered a few more things. BIG mistake. Big wait for a big let down.

C liked his pizza but not the chunks of tomatoes that were all over it. I ate them. C said the crust was a bit sweet, like Old Chicago's, but it was an ok mini pie. The fruit bowl was a joke. Cubed watermelon with 3 grapes. Pathetic. I ordered the Bacon-Guacamole Deluxe; Guacamole, Smoked Bacon, Pepper Jack Cheese, Chipotle Mayo, Red Onions, Jalapenos & Tomatoes.

Its always a treat trying their latest concoction! Last, if you have not attended one of BJ's ""Beer Dinners"" you really need to make it a point to do so.

I'm giving 2 stars and if the service wasn't so terrible I'd give more because the food is good.  1st time I went I was greeted and sat by hostess (on the patio). A server never came out for at least 10 minutes. This is unacceptable in the middle of summer in AZ. Water should have been brought by a server or hostess. The service from there continued to be so. Un-attentive to say the least. I mentioned to what I thought was management and a mere apology was given.  Gave another chance yesterday. Server took order without writing anything down. Of course when we got our food, the order was wrong. When we addressed her, she attempted to blame my sister. We were never checked on the entire time. Our waters continued to stay empty. I was at least smart enough to sit inside this time. She seemed very attentive to her to other tables and it was mid day on a Thursday, so not a busy time at all. When she finally did check on us, I just said we were ready for our check. She handed it right over. It was the only one in her apron. What if we were going to order more. Just seemed like she was in a hurry to get us out of there. I'm huge on customer service, as much as I like good food, I pay a premium when going out to have good service and this place just doesn't fit the mold...unfortunately.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chandler?start=60

The food is always top notch, we have never ordered something that we did not like here and that is the truth! The choice of micro brews is outstanding and the service is beyond compare. Crystal was our waitress tonight and she is one of the best! She was quick, efficient and extremely personable. She joked with us, made us laugh and was very non intrusive throughout the meal. She truly made the meal even better! You are so lucky to have her as part of your staff!! Thank you Crystal for your incredible personality! You are a jewel!! Good luck with your fantasy football!! We had the full rack of ribs with the root beer glaze with white cheddar mashed potatoes....perfection!! However, the only downside to our wonderful dining experience was your hostess staff. We entered the restaurant and waited for almost a minute before Tyler even looked up and acknowledged us. Really? You don't even make eye contact with someone who comes in the door 6 feet away from you? I find that totally unacceptable. We were seated near the entrance and I had a perfect view of Bailey and Tyler as they seated people and dealt with those patrons who were leaving. Not once did they say goodbye to departing guests.

The food was good, not out of this world but good. To put it another way I wouldn't tell someone they had to go out of their way to try it but if they're in the area and were looking for a decent place to eat I would definitely recommend it. My wife had the avocado bacon and cheese sandwich. She enjoyed it I tried a bite myself and thought it was good too. I ordered the black and blue burger. The flavor was good and the portions were exactly what you'd expect at a place like that.

We had a table of 5 people starting around 5 PM for a birthday celebration and the restaurant was not busy.  I'm assuming that the server Alysha P, was having a bad day. She was very short and almost rude to each in the group. We had to ask her multiple time for more cocktails, water and such. We even waited for a couple of minutes to get silverware napkins and condiments after our food was brought to the table. Nothing was a priority to her. Four of us are self-employed business owners and the 5th person is a restaurant manager.

The balsamic chicken said it was a chicken breast and it was not the breast also the potatoes honestly taste like they were box mashed potatoes with cheese on them.

Jeannie C.,"Phoenix, AZ",189,14,30,1.0,5/6/2015,"One of the WORST EXPERIENCES EVER.  1. Ordered the cajun pasta but the flavor did not taste Cajun. I had it once before and it was very good. It took a while but I was finally able to wave down the waitress and asked her if there was any way to make it more ""Cajuny"". It came back smelling like dirty sink water & it tasted like straight up salt along with a hint of the dirty sink water, making it completely inedible.  2. My boyfriend asked for extra toasted buns on his crispy jalapeño burger and it came out very soft and un-toasted.. Their excuse for that was that they toasted the underside of the buns more than usual.. what kind of logic is that? The underside of the bun just gets soggy anyway because of the sauce so isn't it obvious if someone stresses the fact that they need the buns extra toasted they would do both sides of the buns? 3. We were unable to get even one refill due to the extremely long absences of the waitress and my boyfriend even yelled for her when she was 3 feet away and she still wouldn't turn around... and the restaurant wasn't even loud, the table next to where our waitress was standing even looked at my boyfriend because he was calling for her. The experience was more of a hassle than anything. For the hour we spent at here, 30 minutes was spent looking around waiting for the waitress to bring us the check and togo boxes. After the 15 minutes past of waiting for the check my boyfriend kept urging me to walk out on the check with him because he felt like they didn't deserve our money but I waited another 15 minutes to pay for this horrible experience... Since when did it take 30 minutes to get a check and togo boxes?  Worst of all, it was an extremely slow night, slow enough to see plenty of waiters sitting around and talking for 20 mins. Luckily our waitress took the pasta off of our check so we didn't have to pay for the extremely salty, dirty, sink water flavored pasta. Now that I think about it, I should've listened to my boyfriend. This experience, along with 1 burger and 2 appetizers was not at all worth $27.

I had the grilled Mahi Mahi Mahi tacos (guess what? there's also a picture of these!) off the lunch menu and they were quite good.  The tacos came with chips and a small dish of salsa and guacamole.  Not a big fan of the guacamole, it was too soupy for my taste.

Called in again to extend my party number and a different manager said I wasn't even put down for a reservation. I'm glad I called or else my party and I would've shown up with no table. When we arrived, we had to wait 25 min even though it was late night on a weekday (it was not busy). During our meal, we were checked on once which is unfortunate because I drink a lot of water and need refills semi-frequently. None of this bothered me until two of my guests had to leave early so they got their check, left cash on the table, and left. Our waitress Laura threw a little fit about how much they did or did not tip. Even though the rest of us tipped normally, her attitude made us all reflect on whether we wanted to tip well or not. She proceeded to drop our cards down on the table for us to go through since she was annoyed. We wanted to put in an additional desert order to make her some more money and she was annoyed because she had already taken an order for us. She forgot to grab my card I was holding up so she was annoyed that she had to come back for it but I mean I don't have to pay if you don't want me to right?

Puja C.,"Queen Creek, AZ",111,28,16,4.0,7/17/2014,"Main Points: -Variety of beer and food -Good portions on dinner menu -Great for groups Review: If you're looking to grab some food outside of the mall's food court, consider stopping into BJ's. They've got a very extensive menu with various types of cuisines, so it's sure to suit everyone in your group or the individual who just can't decide on one food type that sounds good.  I've tried several things on the menu in the past, and I've thoroughly enjoyed their signature gynormous potatoes, tasty beer, and melt-in-your-mouth pizzookies.  If you're looking for something with a little bit of spice, try their jambalaya - not sure how it fares with authentic cajun cooking, but it hits the spot. I may have to give the lunch menu another try, but I was a bit disappointed with the things I tried today: Chicken quesadilla- hardly any cheese and not enough food for a lunch, Margherita Flatbread - too small and sauce tasted like the diy luncheable pizzas from elementary school, Turkey bacon ham sandwich - just your regular sandwich nothing special, and their Pale Ale chili - no spice and not a very good overall flavor.

Mar L.,"Tempe, AZ",389,262,10,3.0,2/17/2014,"I don't know what I was thinking BJ's was, but not what it is. I thought it was a run-of-the-mill steakhouse, and it's more of a run-of-the-mill brewery. Does this make a difference, you might ask - and yes it does.  So, as this will not become a stable of mine, my visit did make me want to come back in the right mindset and the right company. Plowing through brews and sliders - yeah, I can see that happen. OK, so the service is standard, and the food seems very basic and the brews are a bit interesting.. but I did notice that besides having quite a few Pale Ale's and IPA's, every other ale is pronounced to be 'hoppy'. What if I don't want a hoppy beer, nor want the token lager that is the stand-in for the go-to Bud/Miller/Corrs/30for$20 kinds of beer. I guess my options are limited, but I will need to plow through them all before I conclude that BJ's might oversell their product just a bit. I started with the Jeremiah Red, and wasn't blown away. I'd ask more of a Red Ale, and this was way middle of the road. Also very hoppy, even if it suggests being 'Not too hoppy in order to emphasize the complex malt flavor and fruity aroma'. I do not concur - I think its was too hoppy for a Red Ale. I will have to go hard next time to evaluate their brews. I have a feeling that I will not be all too impressed - but then again I will try to remain unbiased.  So where does this leave me? Nah, it's all right I guess.. and I will come back when the time is right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chandler?start=140

Evan B.,"Tempe, AZ",262,546,1811,4.0,1/28/2010,"Great beer made on site, and some unique deep dish pizzas make for a great happy hour and reverse happy hour.  Despite the recent rise in the price of the mini pizzas the half off deal at happy hour is hard to beat. The deals on the beer are not the best, but they quality makes up for it.  I really like the spinach artichoke pizza, Imagine taking a pizza and using a creamy artichoke spinach dip in lieu of tomato sauce. That is one rich deep dish pizza. Couple with a tatonka stout and it is one great meal to indulge in.  Some of their other great beers are the Jeremiah red. As the name implies it is a red Irish beer. Usually there is a Belgium seasonal high gravity beer whose flavor and alcoholic punch is are to beat. For happy hour beers are $1 off mini pizzas are 1/2 off and most appetizers are $2 off. There is some deal on well drinks, but then why come to a brewery to drink anything other than beer?   If you find your self feeling the effects of the beer too quickly the potato wedge fires make for a great sponge to soak up some of the happy juice in the beer.

Brandon H.,"Chandler, AZ",14,24,,5.0,2/6/2014,"There are a lot of bar and grill restaurants, so what makes BJ's stand out? Service: The hostesses and servers are always friendly and willing to answer questions about the extensive menu. They always make me feel like a welcome guest. Beer: They brew their own beer, and each type I have tried has been pretty good. They also have a respectable selection of other beers, as well as wines and cocktails. Food: I am always impressed at how consistently good the menu items are. They serve lots of different types of food, and I have yet to find a weak link. The jambalaya I had yesterday was extremely delicious. It had meat or vegetable in every bite, and it was large enough for me to spread over lunch and dinner. Other hits include the calzones, pizza, burgers, pasta, and sandwiches. They seem to be everywhere nowadays, but don't miss BJ's assortment of Pizookies. Get the original, or indulge yourself with the triple chocolate. Ambiance: It is a large dining room with a high ceiling, so it's never that loud. The decor is modern and classy, making it a suitable place for just about any occasion. Value: The portion sizes range from large to huge. Lunch specials start at $6, and regular prices are very fair.

Preston S.,"Oklahoma City, OK",162,178,32,4.0,8/14/2013,"Came here of my Birthday dinner with my girlfriend. I haven't been here since probably they opened way back in the day. It is one of my girlfriends favorite places and after the first place we were going to go to was full of obnoxious drunk people I decided we should come over here after hearing her talk about it. It turned out to be a great decision. There was a 20 minute wait when we arrived but that was not a big deal and not to bad for a Saturday night at a place at a mall. We put in our name and we were given a buzzer so we waited. The hostess even used my name when we came back in when the buzzer went off. Not a big deal but a nice touch. Most places ask for a name and never use it. The place was pretty busy but still not too loud. We got a nice booth and started to look over the menu. They had a lot of stuff that looked good. My girlfriend advised against any pasta dishes as she felt they didn't measure up. Of course she is part Italian so she is going to be a touch critic on Italian dishes. I saw the double cheese burger and my eyes lit up. Can't pass that up. Well it turned out to be a good and bad thing. That burger was HUGE but so good. Big patties, bacon, cheese and everything else. Cooked just how I wanted it. Very good. As got the spicy potato wedges, another tip from the girlfriend, they were delicious. Good thing I was hungry from swimming most of the day but I still couldn't quite finish it. Also I was saving some room for a Pizookie. Which I had never had and my girlfriend never goes to BJs without getting one. I ordered the triple chocolate one and even though there was a little bit of a wait for it, they don't make it until you order it, it was so worth the wait. So ooey and gooey and good. I will definitely be having one too every time we come back here. Overall, I really liked this place. Maybe won't get such a huge burger next time but I will be back. I also really like their in house beer. I had the Scottish ale and it was really good. I would like to try more of their different beers next time. There will definitely be a next time.

At this point I don't want anything else and send it back, to which she says there's a policy of cooking as close to rare, despite being mid well and the second time I've asked. The manager comes to talk to me and I explain her response and he says she was wasn't clear, and FLAT OUT tells me and my friends the kitchen crew isn't good enough to cook a rare burger. Like, blatantly says he has an incompetent staff. I work in food service and have never heard of any manager ever saying basically his staff isn't up to snuff to cook a 5 oz patty rare. He comped the burger and as soon as we got our checks, I paid cash. The waitress gives me change and shorts me 5 dollars. I ask for the manager and he comes by and is somewhat rude about his approach. I work in this industry, I know sometimes you have an off day, but I received bad food, bad service, and bad response.

They're not you-call-it-wells, they're you-call-it-anything, so my smart-ass self ordered top shelf gin with ginger beer. Unfortunately, they didn't have my favorite (Hendricks) OR ginger beer, so I caved with Tanqueray on ginger-ale. Sad, but still a damn good deal for $4. We ordered the lettuce wraps and egg rolls at $6 each as a HH special price. Funny thing about HH pricing, you sorta expect it to be the same regular menu item at a discount price (which is why you're so ""happy"" to attend). Well, a little investigation lead me to realize that the appetizers on the HH menu are SMALLER than their regular-priced counterparts.  The lettuce wrap on HH comes with 3 individual leaves of lettuce with a miniature sample of the meaty sauce while the menu displays the lettuce wraps as 4-6 leaves surrounded  by multiple bowls of filling. How fishy. Then the egg rolls appeared. 4 tiny little nubs of fried dough with avocado that tastes like its drowning in mayo. Did I really just pay $6 for this? Is this really a ""deal"".

Our waiter forgot about us a few times throughout the night, and I watched another waiter tell him to check on us before he was once again going to go into the kitchen without checking on us. We ordered two side salads before our entrees and I must say they were a sad excuse for a salad. Iceberg lettuce, a few carrots and watery ranch. Yuck. I ate a little and decided to wait it out for my entrée. I ordered a mini bacon cheeseburger pizza and my fiancé had the jalapeno pepper jack burger. The first few bites of my pizza were pretty tasty, it had a combination of cheddar cheese, dill pickles, ground beef, bacon and a special sauce. I had eaten it before on a previous visit and really liked it. After the first few bites the pizza seemed very doughy and not cooked all the way through. I might have sent it back but service was quite slow and I did not feel like waiting another thirty minutes. My fiancé's jalapeno burger was okay. It was not bad but not great. The fries were very tasty. We did finish off our meal with a chocolate chip pizookie. That is the saving grace to the whole meal. Warm cookie with ice cream mmmmm.....

Coco K.,"Chandler, AZ",0,9,,1.0,9/9/2015,"The service I received on 4 Sept last Friday at this location (Chandler) was unimpressive. I was even more disappointed in their management.  My wife and I made a reservation the morning (11:00 AM) of 4 Sept (Friday) for 16+ people for dinner later that night at 7:00 PM.  The host (male) confirmed the reservation (via phone) but when my family along with our friends arrived there later that night, they told us to take a pager and would seat us as soon as possible.  When I inquired as to what had happened, the hostess simply stated that somehow our reservation had gotten deleted in the system and when it was put back into the system, the morning shift entered it incorrectly (6:00 PM).  The server then stated that the current wait was 50 minutes.  I asked to speak to a manager to resolve the issue (as I had 16 individuals w/ their families waiting) and when the manager spoke to us he was less than empathetic in what had happened.  His demeanor was less than encouraging, no apology was given, and he stated he was working the issue but we would have to wait.  There was no sense of urgency to remedy the situation from management and I got the perception that there was very little interest in correcting the error.  Looking around the restaurant, I could easily see that there were vacant tables on the patio (which the manager could have easily offered) regardless if the service would be slow. But no offer was made.  Instead, he stated that we would have to wait the current wait time (50 minutes).   Having a wife who has been in the hospitality management industry for 10+ years, there could have been multiple ways of recovering the situation: Offered patio seating, or at least somewhere to sit, offered some seating at the bar, maybe a few complimentary appetizers to calm the hungry children, or even some waters at least while waiting in the Arizona heat, vouchers or anything to come back another time... at the VERY least, a sincere apology (especially with a party as large as 16+ individuals).  My true disappointment was not that a mistake had happened, but rather how the situation was poorly handled.  We can understand there can sometimes be a miscommunication during a shift change, but poor management and recovery should not be accepted. After talking to the less than empathetic manager, my family and party left BJs and went to the Keg where they were glad to have our business. Sadly, that's $700 in sales BJ's lost out on and also grat that their servers missed out on and more importantly, a loss in some loyal patrons. The great thing about all this is- we have found a new meeting place as our regular dinner location, thanks to the Keg. We will look forward to returning there for our regular dinner outings and will look back and laugh at myself and think what a fortunate mistake this was.  I would suggest a bit more training for the staff, not just for the hostess stand employees, but for leadership/management more importantly. Staff is only as good as their leader.

During the course of my meal, my glass was empty several times and she had to walk right by my table to get to the kitchen, so I'm not sure why she couldn't refill my glass on one of her many trips or while she was just standing around. Also, she never stopped to check on how my meal was or if the food was alright. Then when I went to pay, I gave her my rewards card and she didn't even bother to give me the points from today's visit. Also, the manager was too busy watching the baseball game on TV to pay any attention to his servers or guests. I'm just very disappointed with this visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chandler?start=100

There is a continuous pressure on selling more even while you're still eating, yet never enough time to bring water or even refill glasses. I don't remember a time I was able to relax and enjoy a meal here. On several occasions our server made us feel like we should have been grateful she was serving us.  Most of them have some sort of off-putting attitude as if they'd rather not be there serving guests. Used to come frequently, even had the app but can't be bothered any more.  Restrooms can get really gross looks like no one cares.

This was alright, nothing out of this world.. and it has a lot of sour cream, so if you hate it as much as i do you will spend several minutes just scooping all of it out.  -Appetizer: Stuffed Mushrooms.

I like the texture of the crust, but not a big fan of the toppings. I did not think the aioli that was drizzled on it went well with the pizza. But, you may like it because my girlfriend loved it. The big disappointment was actually the beer surprisingly. i actually enjoyed my hefeweizen very much. Light, full-bodied and flavorful. The red I tried wasn't very good however. My girlfriend's stout was a huge disappointment. It was actually one of the worst stout we have ever had. Not a lot of flavor and had a weird aftertaste.

The avocado egg rolls in particular stand out, and they usually have interesting offerings like bratwurst sliders and other bar food.  Some of the beers really stand out, and this is why you'd want to visit BJ's in the first place.

About 1 year ago, I was there and ordered an appetizer, salad and dinner. The appetizer was stuffed mushrooms that were served ice cold. We told the waiter (bartender) and they took care of removing it from the bill and brought a new ""hot"" one. When my salad was served, I had requested creamy garlic dressing (which they no longer offer) and instead, it came mixed with some type of vinaigrette along with creamy garlic. The manager now had to come over for the second time and agreed something was wrong and again replaced the item. My main course (pasta and chicken) was excellent. The manager removed all the defective items from our bill along with a discount and I was happy with that. Now about 6 weeks ago, I returned and ordered a new item that the waitress recommended. It was the deep dish lasagna. It was disgusting and below the first layers the food was ice cold. I called the waitress over and told her the issue. She sent the manager over and he agreed something was wrong. He left the table and the waitress brought the tab which had no adjustment for the lasagna that was inedible. I was so pissed that I paid the tab along with a 20% tip as she did a good job. I wrote to the company the following day about my dining experience and was immediately contacted by the store manager who apologized. He stated that he meant to take the lasagna off the bill but got busy talking to some people and forgot. He told me to provide my address which I did so he could mail me a gift card to try an entree on them next time. That was 6 weeks ago !!!

The calamari is dry and flavorless. The wings come dry without sauce; you have to ask them to ""toss the wings in sauce"" to  get what is normal wings(wet wings drizzling in sauce) anywhere else. If you don't ask that, they serve fried chicken with dipping sauces, sorry I can get that at KFC not at a supposed premium bar. The salads taste wilted and the dressings seem to lack flavor.

Ive ordered their sandwiches a few times and have been somewhat satisfied with them.  Nothing incredible, but not horrible.   However I did order their nachos one time.  They bring out this mound of red, green, plain nachos with tons of cheese, chili, peppers, etc all over it.  I was thinking this is gonna be good.  After eating the top half of the nachos (the best part), I find myself tasting nothing  but salt salt and more salt.  in the end, im thinking ""Would you like some nachos with your salt?""   Ive been here at least three times, and probably wont be rushing back anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chandler?start=220

This is a busy business, but has adequate seating between the bar, the huge and beautiful restaurant and outside patio seating. We waited around 15-20 minutes on a busy night, but definitely worth it. Sometimes you go places and the menu is so small that it's either really easy or really hard to make a decision. Not the case with BJs! The menu is practically a bedtime storybook, which is awesome because you get to decide from a huge array of dishes, but also a pain because you want to eat everything, as in the case of myself! Boyfriend got the buffalo chicken wonton tacos for an app and he enjoyed them. He had the lighter option pork chops and enjoyed those as well. I had a burger and fries and it was very good. Service was good, too!  Another great thing is the dessert menu, which has a lot of good options, especially more than the average restaurant. (I'm not lying! See here:  ). Opted for the Baked Beignet, but they were out of it, so 2nd choice was the Oreo Cookies N Cream Pizookie! It was suuuuper delicious. I joined their rewards club and always get e-mails for deals, so I suggest signing up, it's worth it!

Mizz jazzi ladi L.,"Chandler, AZ",12,13,2,5.0,7/21/2012,"I do my ratings and reviews based off of Customer Service, Quality, Taste, and portion size of the food and drinks, and the cleanliness and style of the restaurant..... This is by far a new favorite place for me and my husband..... Me, my mother, husband and 5 month old son went to the restaurant on a weekday night around 10:00pm after leaving the movies..... ( We Saw ""Brave"" Great Movie)  Anyhow, lets get right to the important stuff when we entered the restaurant it was very clean, the setting was very romantic, it is a very smooth relaxing place for grown mature adults and families....  We received Friendly customer service immediately as soon as we walked through the door.... Since it was a pretty late  Monday nite  it wasn't too busy so, our waitress informed us that we could sit wherever we pleased.... We took a seat in a nice big round booth that was pretty comfy....  The waitress was very nice and pleasant..... Their menu is huge they have everything from Lobsters to burgers, salads, pizza and everything in between except for breakfast.... They specialize in freshly brewed beer and drinks.... Me and my husband don't drink so unfortunately I can't give a review on the alcohol.... Once seated the waitress took our drink order and me and my mom ordered they're Strawberry-Lemonade...... It was cool and refreshing, very tasty, the drink had plenty of strawberries the lemonade was not tart or too sweet, it was just right..... The waitress told us that they make it fresh every morning.... They actually charge per glass for the strawberry-lemonade..... But, our waitress gave us free re-fills...... (So in return she received a huge tip)  So on to the best part.... (I did taste everyone's dish)The food was Hot, freshly made, and very flavorful....  My mother ordered grilled pork chops with mashed potatoes and veggies.... Her meal also came with this awesome sauce which I will get into in a moment....  The grilled pork chops were so tender and juicy the seasonings and flavors were just right..... I will most definitely be ordering that next time I go again..... They also gave my mom this great vinaigrette, red wine, mustardy, type of sauce for the pork chops.... The sauce was amazing.... The mashed potatoes where fresh and hand mashed or blended (either way it wasn't instant mashed potatoes) They were red potatoes and they were seasoned just right and they were delicious.... (my 5month old son loved them) The mixed veggies were steamed and seasoned lightly.... They still had a nice crisp to them and great bright color.....  Now my husband he ordered the salmon with veggies and white rice.... His salmon was very moist and  tasty......  The rice was lite and fluffy..... The veggies were crispy and very refreshing.... My husband had water with his meal.... Last but not least, I ordered the steak salad... The salad was green, fresh, crispy and cool it had romaine lettuce and a lot of other great healthy greens.... the salad came with a very flavorful vinaigrette dressing.... they placed the steak on the side of the plate.... I think that they were a little stingy with the steak.... but other than that the steak was juicy cooked med-well and had a great taste..... The salad was very fulfilling and tasty..... it also came with a piece of bread and it was good nothing to brag about.....  Overall this is one of my favorite restaurants.... Me and my husband usually go here for our date nites and when we want to be romantic..... Its a great atmosphere and the food is amazing.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chandler?start=180

Chris O.,"Chandler, AZ",43,19,,3.0,11/20/2011,5 stars = The environment was great. There is a good view of a television from every table. That is often a problem with sports bars with large dining areas. 4 stars = The food was above average. I had the New Orleans Jambalaya. It was very good. Well seasoned and the food was cooked just right. Only complaint is there was too much meat and not enough rice. Wasn't mixed perfectly but still good. 3 stars = The menu is too random. Like they haven't decided what type of food they are going to master. Because of this the food is different every time I come here. The food depends on which cook  is cooking which meal.  2 stars = The server was awful. The only reason I am giving the server a 2 is because the server delivering the appetizers and food was very pleasant. Our server tried to remember the order but forgot and had to come back and ask. She did not refill drinks at all. She actually came by several times and looked at the empty glasses and ignored it.  She was too busy talking with other servers to pay attention to her tables.  3 stars = Total Review  I will try this restaurant again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chandler?start=180

Just prior to arriving at BJ's our 7 y.o. daughter wanted some pretzel bites from Wetzels and we also decided to get some pigs in a blank for my mother-in-law. We walked into the restaurant where the manager very rudely and loud enough for other patrons to hear tell us we could not bring food from other ""restaurants"" into ""her"" restaurant. Her overreaction was completely unnecessary and very embarrassing to my family and me. Undeterred, we did stay even though we were forced to sit outside, not our first choice of seating arrangements. The wait staff was embarrassed by the actions the manager and they did a great job taking care of us. Perhaps a better way for the manager to handle the situation would have been to offer us a doggie bag or some way to conceal our ""contraband"" so we might have enjoyed indoor seating along with the other paying customers. On an up note the food and libations were excellent; the service was fantastic and I can only hope that the manager gets a scholarship to charm school prior to our next visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chandler?start=200
Adrienne K.,"Phoenix, AZ",111,16,1,4.0,12/6/2012,"My man had a wild hair to go here tonight and so we went. We both ordered top sirloin, but his came with a bleu cheese butter sauce on top. Mine came with no toppings, and the waitress didn't offer steak sauce. Hmm. Since I like my steak well done, one would surmise that I would probably want something to dip it in or pour over it, n'est-ce pas? But no. We waited for her to come back, he asked her for steak sauce and she comes back and puts it on HIS side of the table. You know, the side with the steak that already has a topping. Uhduh?  Also, I ordered my steak well done and it was perfect, albeit DRY as there was no sauce and I almost choked on it. But he ordered his medium, and it came out with no pink. Huh? All in all, a good deal for the dinners which were around $16 each. Good calamari app. Nom nom. The wine I chose was delicious - a blend, they're usually better. The garlic mashed potatoes were yummy too. This is the 2nd time we've dined here since moving to Phoenix and I still give it a thumbs up. The first time I enjoyed the ""Enlightened Thai Chicken Mango Salad"" and highly recommend it if you're into that kind of dish. But if you order steak, be careful to order it less done than you really want it. I probably could've played hockey or maybe football with mine. Good gracious. No other snafu's tonight, except that the tables outside were a bit too close and as the large party next to us was being seated, my boyfriend had a bunch of butts in his face. Back that ass up, ladies....actually, WE had to push our table away twice. And later a waiter was trying to carry like a million plates away from a table and of course he dropped them and scared us, giving us a few more grey hairs (thanks a lot). This stuff happens and it's like eh, whatever, who cares. But these details do kind of dampen the ambiance.  Really love the large selection of everything!

J P.,"Mesa, AZ",1,390,,2.0,4/13/2013,"Beer is ok. Food...meh. After watching more restaurant rescue shows than are healthy I should have learned a long time ago that any place with a menu the size of a phone book does mediocre food at best.  BJs is no exception to this rule. The menu appeared to be heavy on pizza like products so I figured going that direction was the best bet...so I ordered a flat bread.  It was supposed to have tomatoes, cheese and sausage.  Tomatoes, yes.  Cheese, yes.  Sausage...not so much.  There were a few (and I mean a few, sausage piece like substance on the flat bread, but I wouldn't say it was enough to qualify as saying the flat bread had sausage. As for the bread part of the flat bread it was crispy in parts and soggy in parts.  Overall not a good effort. So assuming you can't make the most prominent thing on your menu (pizza like products) well it is fair to assume that the products on the other 90 pages of the menu (yes an exaggeration...its probably only 12 pages long) are, in all likelihood, mediocre also.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chandler?start=200

Julie Y.,"Chandler, AZ",9,25,1,2.0,8/18/2013,"We had a mixed experience here today.  I'll start with the positive:  The appetizer platter we got was very good and the kids LOVED the mozzarella sticks.  The adults enjoyed the avocado spring rolls, the other kind of spring rolls (not sure what they were called), and the artichoke dip with chips. The beers we selected were also good.  I loved mine, but once again I can't remember the name (it was the one our waitress said was the closest to a blue moon beer).  Lastly their thin and crispy fries were wonderful!   Ok, so now for the bad:  The men in our group ordered some kind of chicken tacos and the other ordered a personal size pizza...both were TINY portions.  I was not thrilled with the so called sourdough bread that my California chicken sandwich was on...the bread tasted a little burnt.  The worst thing about this meal was that the waitress announced that they were out of the chocolate chip pazookie dessert for the rest of the evening....WHAT?!  When you have little kids that look forward to this dessert, it is not a good thing when you are told that!  This was a late Saturday afternoon...how do you not have plenty of those desserts on hand for a SATURDAY NIGHT????  I still enjoyed the white chocolate and macadamian nut mini pazooki that I got and the kids liked the cookies and cream one they tried.  The pazookies at Oreganos are still better in my opinion....

The decor and space was amazing..very spacious  and very nice design.  The staff was friendly- but our server was a little flighty- I don't think she had been working there very long as she wasn't very familiar with the menu and had to ask us what the menu said. I am a restaurant manager and I would never put someone on the floor who wasn't familiar with the menu- it looks bad on the serve and on management. We ordered 2 ribeye dinners and 1 chili cheeseburger. My brother requested his steak to be rare and when it came to our table it was more on the well side and when he asked  to have it sent back and cooked the way he wanted the man- who I am assuming was the manager- acted like it was a hassle. My steak was slightly overdone but still edible and tasty. My husbands chili cheeseburger was amazing! The chili was very tasty and it was a huge meal! He left very satisfied! One thing I absolutely loved was the horseradish mashed potatoes- they were amazing! I had never had horseradish m.potatoes but I am glad I tried them- I even started making some at home.  The  mixed drinks were amazing too!  My brother ordered a glass of their dark beer and he loved it- he has always loved dark beers and this beer was right up his alley. Oh! Almost forgot- we also ordered the mini bruschetta for our appetizer- and WOW! I could have eaten 5 plates of that stuff - the best bruschetta I have ever had! Overall this place was really good!

Pizookie was good but they are easy to make at home, not worth it to pay for one here. Service was good although my avocado was initially left off my salad. Would I go back?

Deiniol M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",252,73,44,2.0,9/22/2008,"A note to the owners of BJ's Restaurant & Brewery regarding the style of pizza you serve: I don't know what it IS, but I can tell you what its NOT, and its most definitely NOT 'Chicago-Style'. How do I know this?  Because up until about a month ago, I called Chicago home for the last 20 or so years. Pizza has three main ingredients- a crust, a sauce (typically a tomato-based sauce), and cheese (typically mozzarella).  Serving two out of the three does not mean you can still call it a pizza.  This is pass/fail, all or nothing, an you are not graded on a curve; there is no 'E' for effort. Now some will argue, but typically, 'Chicago-style' pizza has a thick crust and, in at least a couple of restaurants, the sauce and cheese layers are inverted, but the pizza HAS sauce (am I making my point here, or am I being too subtle?). Do yourself a favor, BJ.  Go to Chicago, and go to Gino's East, Pizzeria Uno, Due's, and Lou Malnotti's for a crash course in what 'Chicago-Style' pizza is, then come back here and fix this trainwreck of bread and cheese before you do any permament damage to the phrase 'Chicago-Style Pizza'; well, no more than you've already done. Your one saving grace is the beer you brew right on premises, otherwise this two-star review would be a one-star review, and I'd never have a reason to darken your doorstep, or subject anyone else to your bread with melted cheese on top. Keep up the good work on the beer, but fire the guy that came up with your pizza recipe and start over.  Then I may try another one of your pies; until then, I'll just stick to the beer. Viewing it from that angle, then, BJ's has a nice bar.  Its a bit loud inside for a restaurant, but for a bar, its just fine, and they do have lots of TVs tuned to just about anything you could want to watch. Come for the beer, stay for the... beer.  But if I've been too subtle, and you missed the point- don't bother with their 'pizza'.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chandler?start=280

Emily T.,"Saint Louis, MO",36,233,7,3.0,9/14/2008,"BJ's is OK on occasion. My husband loves the mostly sauceless, tomato-strewn pan pizza. Me, not so much. However, the atmosphere seems fun (kind of loud, but that drowns out our usual loud talking). There are flatscreen TVs throughout the restaurant, in case a game or a major weather event (hurricane season) is on. The booth seating is comfy, and we see a lot of families, so it looks pretty kid-friendly as well. I've tried various dishes here, such as sliders washed down with BJ's Hefeweizen. The sliders and thin fries were pretty darned yummy, and the 5 oz. taster-sized Hefeweizen was the perfect size (and price!) for a lightweight and/or someone who has to drive soon thereafter... I am not a beer connoisseur, so YMMV! On separate occasions, I've tried the Angel Hair Toscana dish, which was just OK and came with a side of garlic bread. I've had the French dip on a couple occasions, and that is highly recommended; I love a good au jus... The other night I tried the Field of Greens salad with candied pecans, feta, red peppers, and a balsamic vinaigrette; that was quite yummy. I coupled that with a taster-sized Berry Burst Cider, which is really sweet and hit the spot. For dessert, the Cookies N' Cream Pizookie is quite good, so you might want to save room for that (be sure to share it with 1 or 2 more people ~ it's rich and should feed at least 2)! The Apple version pales in comparison ~ don't bother with that... Finally, I'm a caffeine fiend, so I was pleasantly surprised that their coffee does not taste like old socks.

Carina M.,"Seattle, WA",273,983,177,2.0,5/12/2008,"I am no stranger to BJs - I grew up in California, which is where this chain originated from. I'm not a fan of this BJs. We live about 10 minutes away from it, but I find we go to the one on Superstition Springs more often. We go to BJ's for the food, never the drinks. Hubby's a huge beer lover. When we lived in San Francisco, we used to do pub crawls with our friends in search of the perfect pint of Guinness. Anyway, we went to this BJs because he had heard good things about the beer here, more specificially, their brewmaster. He'd read rave reviews and thought, ""why not?  we're practically around the corner!"" Off we trotted and he ordered the beer and I ordered a salad...and he was angry.  Angry at beer. What?! Not again. It's ok.  I was angry at my salad and the slower service. He finally learned his lesson - never get the beer at BJs. The first BJs experience was back in California at the BJs in Cupertino, across the street from the Apple campus (yes, as in iPod). He and his best drinking mate, Matt, went for beer...one they ordered tasted like Juniper. The second one he ordered ""tasted like how sweaty gym socks smelled"". His exact words.  *gags a little* He thought it would be different at this BJs...but was sadly mistaken BJs on the whole will never have imported beer. If you want a decent selection of imported beer, I suggest going to Whole Foods -- you can pick up Belhaven! My salad pissed me off.  There was more dressing than salad. I wanted some lettuce with my dressing. Our server kept sneaking off - don't want to know what he was doing outside for long periods of time and come back smelling of smoke.

We got the fried artichokes and stuffed mushrooms as appetizers, which were very good. Then we split the calzone for two and promised ourselves we'd pace ourselves and take some home. But it was too good and we ended up finishing it. Our server was pleasant and attentive.  I have gone back roughly once a month and sit in the bar area killing time until my husband gets off work.

Julie S.,"Tempe, AZ",3,26,,1.0,2/26/2012,"I'm not quite sure exactly how I feel about this place. I took my family (6 ppl) there for my adult sons birthday. The atosphere was great, the decor was very nice, but the service and the food, not so much. First we had been waiting so long for a table that my family started getting upset that there were families coming after us who were being seated before us and they were just coming in not waiting like we were. It was painfully obvious that the girl running the seating, was very inexperienced and they need someone with more experience.  We were finally seated after about 45 minutes and were really looking forward to having a positive experience. Well, there is always hope.  First the waitress was a bit sloppy and we felt rushed. I use to waitress, you never ever ever rush the people you're waiting on. Then it took about 10 minutes to get our drinks and the only people who recieved water were the people drinking alcohol. There use to be a time that they put in on your table the minute that you sat down. To make it short and sweet, the food. Waaaay over priced for what you get. The appetizers were just ok. Nothing to get thrilled over. My daughters fish was over cooked, the hawiian rice that it came with was too sweet, there was nothing balancing it out. My sons huge Black & Blue Burger had this little tiny bit of blue cheese on it. My giant baked patato cost over $8 and the toppings were hardly enough for a mini potato. About 5 minutes after I ordered it, I told the waitress that I had changed my mind and she told me that it was too late. Really too late to change my mind on a baked potato?

So we decided to share a few apps. We got the spring rolls, lettuce wraps, and the mozz and tomato salad. The salad was pretty good, the balsamic on it was tangy and it was a decent deal at 3$. The spring rolls were also just alright....they were like a tex mex spring roll....the plate has a lot of rolls, but the sauces they serve with it weren't very spicy or flavorful. The lettuce wraps were kind of the same way.... they were a bit bland, not bad, but not good. We ended the meal with the triple chocolate pizookie.

Just about EVERY time we order, one or more of the following is inevitable; there is food missing, we are over charged, the person taking the order doesn't have a clue what they have on their menu, it takes an unreasonable time to get delivered (usually because the driver gets lost) and the ""delivery charge"" amount is excessive. The past few times have just been ridiculous. In fact, the last time we ordered, we had every one of the aforementioned go wrong. We were charged separately for every single thing that should've been included in our meals, (fries, salads, soups, etc.), the delivery gal headed the opposite direction of our location and took over an hour and a half to get here.

My other friend had the honey crisp chicken salad but the chicken was missing-in-action. It sure didn't look like the picture.

Can't go wrong with the crispy artichoke hearts, the pizzas or a baked potato.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chandler?start=260
Violeta H.,"Phoenix, AZ",212,366,141,4.0,12/22/2010,"visited BJ's for the first time while attending a company holiday party. they had a great buffet style setup for the entire group-appetizers, pizza, and cold drinks.  we were all in the patio and it was chilly but still comfortable. the restaurant is nice and open. we went back and the pizza was just as good as when it was not on our dime.. I like that. Chicago style pizza awesomeness! OMG.. one slice fills you up. the pizza is on the rich side so not the kind of pizza you eat often but a great place to treat yourself. looking forward to trying the beer and thin crust pizza...btw, they brew their own beer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chandler?start=260
Max Y.,"Guadalupe, AZ",1,7,,5.0,7/13/2010,"This review is going to be a bit lopsided because I only come in on Tuesdays for their drink specials. The food I've had has been really good: flat bread pizzas, spring rolls, lettuce wraps, burgers, and best of all, their pizookie. All of it is great every time. Tuesdays are definitely the days to go; $2 BJ's pints from 10 to close. You'd think the selection of brews to have on special is too narrow, but they've got a beer for anyone. My favorites so far have been the Jeremiah Red (pretty strong Irish red ale), the Nit Wit (Belgian spiced ale), Big Fish (a pale ale stronger than the Piranha pale ale), and the Grand Cru (10% Beligian!). The servers we've had over the past couple years have all been great and really friendly. Totally worth it, if only for the Tuesdays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chandler?start=260
Brendan W.,"Strawberry, AZ",6,321,348,5.0,2/18/2012,"5 star deep dish pizza.  Great sandwiches, good service.  Call ahead to see how long the wait is.  They turn tables quick and staff up so wait time isn't bad.   Located in front near Chandler mall fountains.  You can walk around with pager.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chandler?start=260
