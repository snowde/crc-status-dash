Nicole F.,"San Diego, CA",337,851,1980,4.0,11/11/2017,"This is my 1st time dining at a BJ's. Spouse dined several times at the one in Culver City. He didn't like the salads but said the burgers are pretty good. Since they were offering Veterans a free meal up to $13 from their entire menu I just decided to go with the jalapeno bacon guacamole burger. This beef patty is prepared your way and even though we both ordered ours medium rare, only mine came that way while his was more medium well. Still, at a burger-bar-kind-of-place like this I never expect to get it how I ask. I was pleased that mine was medium rare. This was a healthy sized burger on a great tasting bun and they did not skimp on guacamole. It also had a ton of jalapenos and two strips of bacon. Definitely a decent burger for the price and their fries were piping hot and seasoned perfectly.  I'm not sure why the reviews on service are bad. We only had a five minute wait on a day where they were giving out free food. Our server was friendly and our food came out expeditiously and hot. I think it's a solid chain and I bumped them to that 4th star for opening up the entire menu on Veteran's day and giving great service and quality food. I would go back if in the area and craving a burger or maybe to try something else from the extensive menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista
Danielle G.,"San Diego, CA",333,11,5,1.0,12/15/2017,Never order delivery from here.  I got a pizookie trio. The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was very hard and burnt.  I ordered the chicken club flatbread. I got the sandwich with fries. The bread was soggy and the fries were old and cold.  I've been here several times before and it's always been decent. But this was by far the worst experience I've had.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista
Henry J.,"San Diego, CA",189,38,93,5.0,10/31/2017,"Came to burn a gift card. I was really surprised with the friendly server (Ruben) and his shadow (Jafer) showed us. Superior service, from offering dessert first, to bringing the appetizers out hot and fast, ahead of our entrees. Appetizers were hot and tasty (we ordered meatballs, and the spinach and artichoke dip with chips). Chips were freshly made with just the right amount of salt for flavor. Meatballs came hot, on a bed of mashed potatoes, and lightly drizzled with gravy. I ordered the Seared Ahi Salad and, wow, it was on point! The light use of dressing, the crisp assorted lettuce and greens, nicely diced avocados, definitely enhanced and brought out the flavor of the seared Ahi. The Seared Ahi salad was proportioned nicely, not too big or too small. There was a generous amount of seared Ahi to balance the salad. Since we were celebrating her birthday, she took advantage of the dessert prior to her meal (and appetizers). Jafer comped her the dessert. I had also just signed up under their BJ app and received a free pizookie. And, although full, I did enjoy the very hot chocolate chip cookie with a nice serving of Vanilla ice cream after my meal. Lately most restaurants are slow to refill my water glass, fortunately for me,  they must have been observing me and kept my water glass full. Kudos to them. That's a huge plus. I commend both Jafer and Ruben for their outstanding service and to the restaurant staff for the hot, fresh, and timely food preparation.  Thanks BJs for a wonderful dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista
Andrea V.,"San Diego, CA",234,107,1659,2.0,10/8/2017,"I have eaten here a few times and I like the food, however it seems this location is going downhill. From the service, the food, and overall dining experience, I have not been impressed. I keep returning in hope that things improve, because I love their pizookies, beer, and deep dish pizzas. But yet again, I've been let down, and left disappointed.  Even when there isn't a long wait time, and the restaurant is slow, the food takes forever. I'm talking 45 minutes to an hour, on a busy and slow day. Maybe it's been my luck here, but I have come for lunch, dinner, on weekends and weekdays, and kinda figured out good times to avoid crowds. Yet, the last 3 times have been awful experiences. From the long wait, poor table service, cold food. However If you get lucky the pizzas are good, their avocado egg rolls are awesome, and their pizookies are delicious. They do have a wide variety of menu items with appetizers, pizzas, pastas, chicken, steaks, salads, sandwiches, burgers, soup, beer/wine, desserts, and pretty much everything for everyone. Other than the poor customer service, lacking kitchen staff and long wait times, the food is pretty good. If it's not cold.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista
Jasmine C.,"San Diego, CA",484,190,734,2.0,9/15/2017,"Decided to come here at 10:30pm because most places were closed. Closes at 12am on the weekdays btw!  I got the Cajun jambalaya, but instead of rice I substituted with fettuccine pasta. The plate was flavorful with all the spices. It wasn't too bad.   My friend ordered the shrimp asparagus penne. I thought it was bland. I definitely could of made this marinara pasta at home.  The calamari was also okay. It wasn't crispy.  The strawberry mojito was good. I really liked the fresh strawberry bites and mint.  The server last night was really helpful. We didn't know exactly what to order so he was able to help us. I thought the service was better than the food. Would I come here again? Probably not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista
Sherry F.,"San Diego, CA",227,146,129,4.0,7/14/2017,"They were having a buy one get one free entree special, so how could we turn that offer down? Had the appetizer sampler which included mozzarella sticks, buffalo boneless wings (or another choice of sauce), avocado egg rolls, and spinach artichoke dip--good value for the quantity. Ordered a half/half medium pizza (don't remember the names but one was the Hawaiian and the other was the CA Supreme). Plenty of toppings, but lacked sauce. The crust was nice and fluffy. Also ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken. Came out super fresh, crispy, flavorful; delicious dish overall. And lastly had the churro pizookie--tasted freshly made and good amount of crunch, chewy, and sweetness.  Wanted to give a shoutout to our server, George, who was super friendly, attentive, and obviously a hard worker. Thumbs up for his service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista
B B.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,5,,5.0,1/8/2018,"y wife and I came in on our lunch break and was very impressed with the speedy service. We let our Server Corey know that we were kind of in a hurry and he totally accommodated our requests. He had our order in and cashed us out within half an hour which was what we wanted. If anything, you just made a repeat customer. We will definitely be back just to sit in his section. Outstanding service. Your soup and salad combo is well worth the price. My wife loved the Lentil.

Rigo S.,"Holtville, CA",2,52,54,5.0,9/14/2017,Decided to come here after shopping at the Las Americas Outlets. Best decision I've ever made! Pizza was super good and dessert was even better! Looks like they've added more pizookies to their menu. Ordered the Monkey Bread Pizookie and Churro Pizookie. Both were extremely good.  Shoutout to Jyssica for tending to our needs and for giving us the tip of getting our ice cream separate from the churro she to prevent them from getting soggy.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista
Andy M.,"Chula Vista, CA",414,211,739,4.0,7/5/2017,"I'm a fan of BJ's, (I like saying that) who wouldn't be. Tortilla Soup, Avocado Egg Rolls & the Pizookie desert are the main reasons I come here! All 3 on point! Of course there is other good things in here to eat but those 3 are my favorite. My wife is a big fan of this place she comes here a lot with her amigas to eat & drink & I'm ok with that because a drunk or buzzing wife is a fun wife when she gets home. So thank you BJ's for keeping my wife fun, she goes to BJ's drinks gets home & I get a..... there's a dirty joke there but I'll leave it alone & keep this review PG-13. :)~ First to start with I love the inside & customer service. Very spacious & a lot of TV's so if your a sport guy like me you'll love it! Right when you come in you get greeted & seated as soon as possible, every time we have came we have gotten good customer service & good quality of food at a good amount of time. Never had a issue with customer service. Bartenders are fast & accurate. Like I said my wife is a big fan & it took me awhile but now I'm a fan as well. It took awhile for me to find enough items to want to come & eat. At first I got fish tacos they were ok, wings were also ok, I wouldn't recommend the chips & salsa & I had a couple pasta items that were also ok. At first I couldn't find items I really loved, but now I have. Avocado Egg Rolls, they are ORGASMIC! I blush when I eat them! You have to start with that as a appetizer & a tortilla soup you'll love them both! My kids, wife & me enjoy their big baked potato with grill chicken in it, it's amazing! Ribs are on point! And if you come here you have to get a pizza, my fav Chicken Bacon Ranch! Make sure to get fries their pretty good here. And don't leave until you eat desert I don't care how full you are, get the pizookie you'll thank me later!  Over all I have really grown to like this place & look forward to coming here with the family. I hear the steak is very good & they got great happy hour prices & good specials on their burgers on certain days, gonna have to try it. So thank you BJ's for the good food & customer service & sending my wife home buzzing & happy this husband appreciates it & salute you! Keep up the good work & I'll see you soon! I am a fan of BJ's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista

Rock J.,"Chula Vista, CA",74,4,24,5.0,12/10/2017,"I don't usually write reviews, I just enjoy the food. But when the food is delicious and your server is on point, one can't help but to give praise. Our server, Ernesto, was both polite and humble. When you have someone coming to check up on you and making sure everything is to your satisfaction, you think that's just their job, but Ernesto anticipated our needs. We placed our dessert order at the same time we ordered dinner. When you do that, dessert tends to come out at the same time as your food. With that in mind, Ernesto advised us that he won't place the dessert order just yet. Cool beans!! Mid way through our meal, Ernesto comes back to tell us that he'll place our dessert order and that by the time we've finished eating, dessert should be on its way out. No sooner than I swallowed my last bite of steak, Ernesto is bringing out dessert. I know this might not seem like much to praise about, but for me, this type of service is golden. Thank you so much Ernesto!!! You are the reason I will be coming back to BJ's",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista
Don B.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,133,44,2.0,11/22/2017,"The kitchen takes so long to prepare your meal that you begin to wonder if the food is coming soon or do you need to return another time for it. The food comes to the table hot, but not always flavorful. Servers seem well intentioned, but end up being fairly ineffective. Stuffed baked potatoes come actually lacking in toppings. The chicken fried steak burger was so lacking in taste that the bright spot on the plate was the mashed potatoes we subbed for French fries. What is really interesting is that THIS particular BJ's does not meet the standards for food or service you normally experience at other local BJ's. Go to a different BJ's for a better meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista

Krystal L.,"San Diego, CA",4,21,5,1.0,12/3/2017,We called ahead and reserved a table from 6pm. We got seated and after 20 minutes of not receiving any service I said something to a server walking by. Turns out they sat us at a table with no server. Let me add they were not even that busy. A server who was already super busy with her tables took on our as well so I was not expecting great service. The kitchen did not bring out the appetizer we ordered so I asked that it be removed from the tab. I ordered a steak medium well and it was burned. I ate it anyway because I was starving.

Food has come out cold and incorrect the past 3 times of going.  The most recent time we ordered online for a half white pizza and half barbecue. I would say about one fourth of the pizza was white pizza and the rest was barbecue. Which wasn't even the correct white pizza, they didn't put the white sauce that should be on there which is Alfredo. Once we got home we realized it and of course did not want to go back. Just a waste of money .I love the food at bj's so I always go back !but I suggest to everyone to Make the extra long drive to la Mesa and enjoy your dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=40

I dig the bar area for sports watching, for sure. They've also got a great beer selection and a pretty good, diverse menu. The staff is also very friendly. The deep dish buffalo chicken pizza is a go-to for me (SO good!) and the hubs, as are the sriracha brussels sprouts (though this last visit, they could've been cooked longer). I recently learned that their burgers aren't so great, but the menu is HUGE, so there are plenty of other options.

WARNING: They put two little dollops of wasabi on the sides of the plate and I didn't realize because it was in a more creamy consistency and I confused it with avocado.. well i ate it by accident and it kept getting mixed up in the salad.

Jessica S.,"San Diego, CA",235,920,2051,2.0,1/2/2016,"Not my favorite BJ's location.  They were pretty empty when we arrived, right around noon on a Saturday. And when I say ""empty"", I mean it. Not even the hostess stand was occupied at that time. There was one waiter wandering around, but we ended up waiting for about five minutes for someone to show. And when she walked around the corner, she looked surprised to see us.  Our waitress was friendly, I'll give her that. She was patient with me taking my time going through the menu, and then with my snap decision to change my order after I'd already placed it. I NEVER do that!  We both decided on the Unlimited Soup and Salad combo (to be fair, I wanted something else to start). I got the Tuscan Tomato soup with the Caesar salad, he got the Chicken Tortilla soup with the Tomato Basil salad.  Here's the thing. The place was mostly empty. Our orders weren't particularly complicated. And yet, it took almost twenty minutes for our food to get to us. I was almost beyond my hunger by the time we got our meals.  My soup was okay, though a bit oily. It could have done with a dollop of cream or a smattering of cheese, though. The salad was terrible. I love Caesar salads, and before today wouldn't have thought that one could be messed up... The Chicken Tortilla soup was the star by far. It was spicy and flavorful and hearty. I contemplated getting a bowl for myself for a second serving, but ended up stopping after the first round.

He even had to dismiss one of the other servers complaining about other customers while they were in front of me at one point. I've been to many BJ's before and the food was far below what I'm accustomed to from their franchise. One of the worst steaks and side items I've ever had at a restaurant.

Chloe Ysabelle S.,"San Diego, CA",23,14,18,1.0,7/15/2017,"The worst BJ's I have EVER been to. This place is a mess. Whoever hired the staff there needs to be fired, asap.  After watching a movie, my friends and I decided to come here to eat dinner. Ladies at the front are completely unprofessional. Always chatting it up, ignoring customers. We got seated after 10 minutes. all was well.  It took 20 minutes for our waiter named Mario to even come by and greet us. He walked past our table SEVERAL times. He asked us what we wanted to drink, and we waited another 15 minutes for our drinks to come. Waited another 15 minutes for him to come back to our table and ask us what we wanted to order. Mind you, he kept passing by our table.  He finally asked us what we were going to eat, and after we said the main entrees, I SAID SPECIFICALLY, ""FOR DESSERT, WE WOULD LIKE THREE PIZOOKIS."" He said ""okay, your order should be coming soon.""  30 minutes later, a pizooki came. BEFORE OUR MEAL. I said politely, "" Sorry but I said this was supposed to come out after we're done eating?"" The lady that brought it to us said, ""Alright let me find out what's going on with your server. You can just keep that."" Our waiter then comes and says, ""You guys ordered the pizooki right? Now you guys are saying you don't want it anymore?"" I said, ""No. I told you specifically that the pizookis were for dessert. It doesn't make any sense for us to eat the dessert before our meal."" The nerve of this guy to then all of a sudden reply with ""well you should've ordered it afterwards, whatever."" My blood was beginning to BOIL at this point.  After another 30 minutes, our food finally came. All except my friend's chicken alfredo. We thought it would arrive 5-6 minutes after we had all gotten our food, but NOPE. It never did!!!!!! I called someone else over and I said, ""You guys have the worst costumer service ever. We've been waiting for about an hour now and we still don't have my friend's food. We're all pretty much done eating. Our waitor was extremely rude and threw a fit about us complaining about the pizooki coming BEFORE our meal. I would like to speak to your manager. ASAP!!!""  Not to mention I also has to ask 4 DIFFERENT PEOPLE FOR HONEY MUSTARD AND RANCH!! THE LAST PERSON FINALLY BROUGHT IT TO ME AFTER I WAS DONE WITH MY SANDWICH!!  The next thing you know, our waiter stands by our table talking to another waiter. He then proceeds to state, and I quote, ""I GOT SOMETHING GOING ON WITH THESE DAMN KIDS OVER HERE."" That's when I completely LOST it. I told the girl that I talked to and asked to bring the manager over to come to our table once more. I told her what he just said and she said that she apologized and that the manager would be coming to our table soon.  The manager came, I told him our dilemma. Gave the whole speech about how sorry he was, etc. And we got a new waiter, as if that was really going to help at all at this point because she was just as shitty as the other one.  Alfredo came, and the pizookis came afterwards. We ended up getting the drinks for free, pizookis for free, and alfredo for free. 40 bucks for 7 people. Lol that was the only good thing that came out from that night. We didn't bother leaving a tip. I don't really care. They treated us like shit, pretty much expecting us to somehow compensate for their actions. Mario, if you're reading this, a big FUCK you. If you hate your job so much, quit! Stop ruining your customer's day just because you've got a stick up your ass. He was also frustrating the other people behind us. Kept messing up their order and everything.  Anyway, never coming back here. Would rate -1000 stars if I could.  Oh, and i'm not exaggerating these time frames.  It literally took us nearly 3 hours to get out of that hell hole because they were so slow.

Elizabeth O.,"San Diego, CA",266,189,1760,4.0,10/8/2015,"I came in with family to celebrate my 25th birthday. Our server was Ernesto. Ernesto was very friendly and smiley. The ambiance of the restaurant was very nice. It was like a combination of elegant restaurant and sports bar. There were several TVs throughout the restaurant with sports playing. The tables were nice and big and very comfortable. There was plenty of space in between tables and it didn't feel crowded although it was a little busy. It was however a bit dark and I had to use the flashlight on my phone to read the menu.  Oh boy, the menu was intense. There were probably about 20 pages and there was so much to choose from. There wasn't a lot of pictures and the font was very small. I felt a bit overwhelmed on the selections and being an indecisive person it took me a while to finally figure out what I wanted.  We started off with the potato skins appetizer. It was alright. It was lacking several toppings on a few of the skins. Overall it was O.K.  I ordered a sweet tea with lemon and the tea was actually very good. I ordered the Fish N Chips with wedge fries. The fish was nice and crispy and the fries were excellent. They had the perfect flavor and perfect amount of crispiness and softness. My mom enjoyed her pulled pork sandwich.  My mom said the BBQ sauce on her sandwich was nice but was pretty spicy, but she did enjoy it and finished the whole thing. My brother ordered the double decker and he thought it was going to be hot but it was cold but he said he liked it. My family told them it was my birthday and after we got our to-go boxes our server brought me out a small Pizookie with a candle and said Happy Birthday. They didnt do a birthday cheer or song. Thats ok. The pizookie was very doughy. It was tasty but i could only eat one bite! My brother loved it and ended up eating the whole thing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=40

We waited while they arranged two tables for us. Even though we were here to celebrate my moms birthday we didn't mind. The hostess was not warm and welcoming to the point and infant even mentioned her rolling her eyes at us. Our server (Eli) Elizabeth made the experience better with her warm and friendly personality.  Been here several times and this is the first time I'm not happy with the service and I actually have to write about it. The first impression of the place is the hostess and it was not welcoming. If it wasn't for our waiter who I would rate five stars and the food that actually was good then I wouldn't have enjoyed myself with my family.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=40

Aside from our waitress Stephanie and the bartender, the service was horrendous and ridiculously unprofessional. My family came in for lunch around 12:30 and was met by 4-5 employees doing absolutely nothing but having very loud personal conversations at the hostess stand. The ""hostess"" took just enough time to turn to us and point at a table and said "" You can sit up there in that round booth the waiter will get you menus"" im no expert but im pretty sure thats the hostess job to TAKE YOU to your seat and SEAT YOU with menus. NOT TODAY! After we sat ourselves the really important conversations and revolving group of disrespectful annoyingly loud employees using the hostess stand as a hang out continued. At one point i asked the waitress if this was a regular thing and she went to tell them to quiet down........ which didnt work.

Kheyla-Thiana H.,"Chula Vista, CA",133,17,12,3.0,1/5/2017,"For a well-known restaurant I was highly disappointed. While it looks nice and is very clean inside and out, I had terrible experiences both times.  My first visit was with a group of 4 before a movie. We were seated right away and everything was great at first. However, we ordered our drinks and it took quite a while to get those, but we figured that everyone was busy serving others. We ordered our food and were excited. Myself and one of the others in our party ordered a steak -this is where it all went downhill. The steak was still very pink even though both of us ordered medium. Not only that but our mashed potatoes were cold. We still ate, not wanting to cause a scene. However no one checked up on us, even though we told them that we wanted the check plenty of times.  The second time, I went with a group of 6. This time, the food was better, HOWEVER, it took about an hour for them to ask our order, about another hour to get the food, and about another hour to get the check AFTER we asked for the check.  Now, I only give three stars because the staff was kind and patient, they had tables big enough for big groups, the restaurant and bathrooms were clean, and they did well on presentation. Honestly, I don't really recommend coming here unless you have a lot of time to pass.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=40

James B.,"San Diego, CA",10,43,9,3.0,9/6/2017,"I usually order food to go so this review is based on this. If I call in and the person on the to-go line takes my order it is usually 99.9% correct. Happy days! If you go to the bar and then decide to order food to go, you should call the TO GO person over to take your order. A few times I have sat at the bar and ordered through the bartenders. Sorry guys/girls - not good for you.   1st time the bartender was busy and wrote my order down. Then she never put it in the computer because she got distracted by someone in the service well (yes, I was in the industry  so I give leniency where it is due but come on! ). :( 2nd time the bartender wasn't busy. I gave the bartender my order and I asked, ""Aren't you going to write this down?"". He tapped his finger to the side of his head and smiled, as if he was going to remember my order. Well, I sat there, had a few beers while I waited for my food and made some new friends. The order came, I didn't check it (stupid me as it is all the way across town to get here). I got home and they put chicken in the derby salad, I told him my wife was allergic to chicken and he forgot to order my button mushrooms.  Lesson learned. If you are going to order food to go, do yourself a favor and order from the person at the TO GO station.  On a side note, I have eaten in the restaurant and AT the bar and my order has always been perfect so take this for what it is. A little tip for the tipsy.  I encounter this at a lot of places that I get food to go so it is ultimately up to me to get it right but it would be nice not to have to bother.

Our drinks came in plastic to go cups with lids and when our food finally came out, it didn't come out together. One persons soup and salad came out first and it was about another 10-15 minutes before the rest of the parties food came out. It was about another 5 minutes before the pizza came out. A different server brought out of pizza, and when it came we asked for cheese, plates to share the pizza, and refills on our drinks, he mumbled something and never came back. Mario returned and we placed our refill order with him. This time half the refills came out in plastic cups while the other half came out in regular glasses. When we finally finished our meal we waited a good while before our check appeared. While our server was very friendly and the food was decent.

Why did i wait to long!!!??? As we walk in the door we wait for a few minutes and we are greeted by a manager. He was very friendly and his customer service skills were great. He sat us in a big booth which was nice bcuz we all had our personal arm space cuz my son and husband take up all the arm space when it comes to eating.  As we sit we have our server ernest help us out. Omg he was perfect!!! Nice patient and very knowledgeable about the menu. The menu is huge! There are two menus, the regular food menu & drinks. We started with raspberry iced tea for baby girl ( which was a bit strong for her ). Angelito... Apple juice and baes got 2 of theyre in house crafted beers i don't know the names lol i had a white peach margarita& later a strawberry splash margarita. Both were great.!! We had the fried asparagus to start as an appetizers while we drank and the kids shared an off menu spaghetti plate. Which was perfect for them due to my son eats alot & my daughter eats very little lol. Them asparagus tho...wow!! Had a great flavor to them and came with a dipping sauce that i found licking off my fingers when the asparagus were all finished lol. Baes ordered a chili bowl... Was delicious and warm. And a plate with half rack ribs and steak... The ribs were  ! Flavoring was amazing and they came right off the bone! That's what i call perfect cooked ribs fo sho! I had ordered the cheddar broccoli soup inside of a sourdough bread bowl...fffuucckk!! This soup was awesome very thick cheddar taste and the bread wasn't too soft or too hard. It was on the crispy side which was perfect to dip with my soup. I also had the baked zitti i believe. It was great had tons of cheese, sasuage and pepperoni throughout the whole pasta.

She recommended some very good food and drinks. The wife and I shared the stuffed mushrooms (excellent choice). I had the full rack of ribs with the root beer glaze (Martrice's recommendation) and it did not disappoint!!! Such good flavor and those ribs were perfectly cooked.

My burger and fries came out in a reasonable amount of time.  The first thing I noticed was the delicious bun, which may have been due to butter.  You are given the option of steak fries or thin and since I am thin I chose thin.  They were fine.  I would have preferred to have sweet potato but oh well.   Marlon (the bartender) checked on me enough to not be annoying and I was able to pay out in prompt manner.   Aesthetically speaking the establishment is very attractive and clean.  I will definitely return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=20

Good thing it was half off of $11 because I would never pay the full price for it. The thing with deep dish pizzas is that they have so much excess dough, that that's all I tasted while eating my mini pizza. It also had more tomatoes than anything... My boyfriend ordered the chicken bacon club sandwich (don't remember the exact name) he said it was simply ok. It was like a chicken bacon club wrapped in a tortilla. It lacked flavor, and he had to a lot more ranch and hot sauce to intensify it. But he was still hungry after he ate so we had to order some pizookies. (Cookies n cream is our favorite out of all!!!!!) the pizookie was the only menu item that was worth it, in my opinion.

Chris H.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,,5.0,8/10/2017,"Since when did BJ's become the newest hotspot to get local beer? Well apparently they have been working hard on getting the best tasting beers of San Diego County for us to try! Our server Ryan offered us what he dubbed as the Taste of San Diego, included Resident: Walk of Shame, .396 Alesmith, Fall: Magical & Delicious and Mangoveza made by Lattitude 33. A 4 set taster for under $7. This was just a visit to grab a quick bite before going to catch a movie and it turned into an fun experience, we will be coming back all the beers were full of flavor, they had so many more selections we will be back to try! I had to write the names down so we can try them again. Thank you Ryan or as he said people call him the Big Kahuna!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=60
Denise M.,"Chula Vista, CA",4,30,58,1.0,5/23/2017,"Do not eat here at night. Service is very slow, they do not have a sufficient amount of staff working. Only one person was waiting tables at the bar section. A salad took 30 minutes to come out and after the food came out it, it took another 40 minutes to ask us if we wanted anything else and we got dessert which of course took another 30+ minutes to make. The salad was plain I could make it at home and the clam chowder was nothing special better off buying some from vons. Save your time and money. The star is for the pizookie. Just come for that.

When we brought it up, the server said ""any idea of what you would like so I can tell my manager?"" And I said, ""yeah I'd like a new half a sandwich and removal of the order off of the bill. 5 minutes later he comes back and explains that it was just blue cheese that was stuck to the bottom of the bread and that their bread comes in daily because they run out every day.  They bring me a whole plate and they never removed it off of my bill.

This usually is never my first choice or an option. The food isn't horrible it's just not great either though. Or maybe just isn't something I crave. This time around, we came because we needed somewhere close by the AMC at the Chula Vista mall which is what landed us here. We got seated right away because they offer to reserve a table or check in through their mobile app so we did that prior to arriving here.  Our server started us with our drinks and by the time he brought the drinks back we were ready to place our order.   1) clam chowder in a bread bowl 2) guacamole burger  3) jalapeño burger  4 gluten free flatbread Pizza w pepperoni & jalapeños  A food runner came back with the first 3 items and I thought mine would just be coming out shortly? A few seconds after the runner dropped the food off the server approached our table and said ""were missing something aren't we?"" Hum yeah JUST my food....   (How did he forget my order? It was literally the last thing and we had a conversation about the pizza as well.) Anyway- by the time I got my food everyone was pretty much done eating but that's fine. Cool thing is he gave me a free salad to eat while I wait so at least I still ""was eating with my boyf and his family"" The manager came to the table and offered to remove it off the bill and emphasized and said those pizzas cook fast. Well, I'm sure everyone has their days or maybe the server was having something on his mind but every time he asked if we needed something at that time if we needed, ranch, a refill on our drinks he ALWAYS forgot we literally had to be like ""hey man still waiting on the ____"" at least 3-4 different times.

Matthew G.,"San Diego, CA",20,14,3,2.0,1/2/2017,"This review is specifically for service on January 2nd, 2017. We've eaten here several times with great food and great service, but for some reason, on this day, the food was subpar and the service was to blame for that. We were seated and ordered our appetizers shortly after drinks arrived. The appetizers would have been excellent if served on time, but it was evident that they sat under the heat lamp for too long. The spinach stuffed mushrooms were starting the shrivel and the avocados in the egg rolls had browned. While the flavors were mostly there, much of the texture was lost and made the food barely palatable.  Once the entrees arrived after a long wait it was also evident that the same problem occurred with the main course as well; the food had been prepared in a timely manner, but service left it under the lamps too long. The top layer of our food was dry. The vegetables had no vibrancy, the top side of the chicken and the sausage and shrimp were dry.  From a culinary standpoint the marinara in the shrimp and asparagus pene was bland as if no seasoning was used at all and the Cajun Jumbolia was over seasoned.  This isn't usually a problem. Again - we've eaten here many times before. Today was just a bad experience. We hope next time that heat lamps won't ruin the experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=60

I am not sure if the communication between server and kitchen is completely lacking or what the issue is. I came last week with a party of three and we all had issues with our food. Uncooked asparagus and calamari, cold food all around, burger over cooked, etc. above all these issues, once our food was fixed and we finished eating, they came out with a second round of all of our food thinking we hadn't been served yet.

A litttle salty but not too shabby. The main pizza dish took a while to come out to be honest. But what stood out to me about this visit was the amazing customer service. My waitress was extremely knowledgeable about what was in the menu, any sides that I had questions about, etc. she was great.

Elyse R.,"San Diego, CA",170,102,102,1.0,10/15/2016,"It's so unfortunate that I have to write this review but I feel like if nothing is said, nothing will change. We come here a few times a month. We always sit at the bar, have a couple glasses of wine, and order food. Every time we come here the bar tender/servers are awesome! Hence, why we keep coming back. I'm in customer service myself and I am a flight attendant for a reputable airline who is ranked #1 by JD Powers every year in customer service. I'm very big on customer service and making our customers feel welcomed, always have a smile on my face, and I do all I can to make sure they are enjoying themselves.  Today, once we sat at the bar. The bar tender Solimar never said hello to us. When he gave us the menus he was not pleasant, and still no greeting. It was awkward. It took a while for us to get our drinks and there were only 4 others sitting at the bar. He kept walking passed us and never once checked in with us. We finally had to ask him if we could order food... who does that?! We should never have to ask, he should be on top of it. Again, we felt so awkward. The food that was brought out to us was the wrong order and this happened TWICE. We gave up because we never got the right appetizers we ordered. Plus, those wrong items were on our bill. Horrible customer service. He never refilled our cocktails and never asked us how our food was. The other customers at the bar were complaining too. One gentleman only ordered a beer and poor guy waited so long for a refill and he was so frustrated. We did nothing nothing wrong to deserve service like this. Solimar didn't care to make the situation right. We shouldn't have to go out and pay for horrible customer service. We had to ask him for everything and we don't understand why he kept avoiding his customers at the bar. We were in a hurry to leave because this ruined our evening. All we wanted to do was get out of this place. I wanted to write this review in hopes that BJ's management will address this issue. Maybe Solimar was having a bad day but when you come to work, you come prepared and ready to work. I'm pretty easy going and I understand things can get pretty hectic but all the customers at the bar seemed upset. I hope that this issue is addressed.

Rachel D.,"National City, CA",117,95,241,1.0,1/29/2017,"I've come to this BJs before with no problems. But I don't know what's going on recently. The last two times we've eaten here which was probably within two weeks of eachother. The service was really bad.  First time I was understanding because the waitress told us she was new. (Why they would give a new waitress a party of 11 people is beyond me.) The food seriously took over an hour to come out. I'm not even exaggerating!  The second time which was last night was just as bad. My sister called ahead to put 11 people on the list for a table, the lady said it wasn't that busy so it shouldnt take too long. When my aunt got there they said my sister told them 5. So they changed it to 11 so we had to wait a bit. Then when we sat down. We put our drinks in and it took forever for our waiter to comeback with our drinks and to take our orders. Twice random staff came to our table with food looking like they were lost. Not sure if the food belong to us. Which it didnt. I can't even count how many times someone in our table had to say...""Where's our waiter?"" That was the theme for the night. My sister asked a lady who brought food to the table if she can get a refill and the lady said ""Oh yea, you're waiter will get that for you."" Like damn! That would be fine if we can find that fool. Is touching the drink machine not in your job title? You can't even say I'll get your waiter. COME ON! Then I heard my uncle from the end of the table ask another lady if a packet of sugar was regular sugar and she said I kid you not she said ""I don't know"" and when my uncle said but you work here she says ""I'm just a hostess"". I saw all he was trying to figure out was which one was regular sugar from the white, pink, and yellow packets. So I had to explain it to him myself. I don't know why someone in food service doesn't know that answer. Fyi hostess lady, the white packet is regular.

Our server (sorry...so bad with names) was a very friendly young man. He did seem like he may have been a bit nervous or shy maybe, either way though he was still friendly & pretty quick. There was a couple moments where we wondered where he was as we needed some refills, but we spotted him ""busting his butt"" around the restaurant, so it was not big deal. Not like some places where the servers just stand around talking..etc. Anyway, that's besides the point. We didn't wait unusually long, so it didn't bother us too much. Appetizers came out pretty quick, we got the spinach & artichoke dip and mozzarella sticks. Both so delicious. Wednesday night special was loaded burgers & unlimited fries for $10 so my husband and I opted for one of the loaded burger options. I wanted to get the guacamole one like he got...but sadly the onions in the guacamole mix prevent that. Oh well, my bacon cheeseburger one was still so juicy & tasty. My daughter decided to go with the spaghetti dish, which she seemed to really enjoy. I got my strawberry margarita and my husband got one of the craft brew beers. I was a little bummed to find that this place salts the glass of the strawberry margarita, so it was a little hard to enjoy the taste whenever some of the salt crept up in the straw. Other than than not really liking the margarita as much, no complaints about the food or the service.

After our appetizer and drinks( which once again too were given to us after around 10 or so min) we didn't see our waiter again even for refills of our drinks. After about 20-30 min the waiter who was haphazardly running around trying to get all the tables he was manning he finally came back to our table and took our orders.

Jaime R.,"Chula Vista, CA",32,84,18,1.0,11/11/2016,"Very sad and utterly disappointed. BJ's left us hanging or should I say starving like second class citizens! Me and fellow veterans went on Veteran's day to enjoy a complimentary meal on BJ's thanking us for our service! We went to BJ's over other restaurants hoping to satiate our hunger. Well, BJ's made sure too keep us starving after we waited and waited in our booth for an hour for our sandwiches. We finally tapped out and called it quits after seeing other veterans leave with disappointed faces. Other patrons appeared to be happy with their service. I began to think that maybe just maybe we were not their top priority. I am also gonna mention Kerry, our server, she abandoned us! She did her shift change and failed to do a proper turn-over with incoming server. This experience made us feel unappreciated and really hungry! It was just plain sad how they treated us on our day we were supposed to feel honored for serving and defending our country!

Not once did anyone ask how our food was, until the server came over to bring us the bill. Finally she asked if I was finished with my salad, or if something was wrong. Wow.

The sports bar is brighter than the dining area because of the light emitted by the big screen tv. The host seated us and left and then the wait staff came with the menu. Asked us what to drink and left. Several minutes later came back and took our order. We ordered the jambalaya, shrimp scampi (my favorite) and calamari. We didn't see the wait staff for quite a while. I guess there's a lot of walking to cover since the place is bigger than normal size restaurant.

Jennifer A.,"Mission Valley, San Diego, CA",10,32,1,2.0,6/7/2016,"Ate at this location once before. I don't remember the details only that I had a mediocre experience. Anyway, it was a while ago (and maybe a fluke) so I thought maybe I'd give it another try. Besides, I was meeting a friend in the area and there are few places here with decent happy hour.  We came in ~5pm and it was near empty. The hostess motioned that we could seat ourselves at the designated bar area for happy hour. This was fine as from the door, we could see some booths available. Or so we thought. There were 4-5 of them, but they were all yet to be busted. So awkwardly, we walked about before we seated ourselves at the ""cleanest"" table. They busted it right in front of us.  The waitress then came to get our order. She was ok and on point. She brought out our drinks and food before going on her break and giving us the courtesy of introducing her relief while she was gone.  We ordered 3 appetizers along with our drinks.  The California Club flatbread was good. The calamari was just fair. (But I am a fried squid fiend so naturally, I've had better.) My friend was looking forward to the boneless wings. It was a disappointment, more so because not sure if it was what we ordered. She wanted the spicier sauce. We questioned the waiter on it and not being certain himself decided to bring the sauce plate up to his nose to sniff it. My friend was disgusted by this, and left that sauce to the side under quarantine.   I really wanted dessert, but decided Starbucks, a couple doors down would suffice as a better option. Our bill was not cheap. Our regular waitress returned and my friend opted to let her know about the ""sauce incident"" as we were signing the check, not to complain but to give them the constructive criticism to better their service (so she reasoned). Does it matter anyway? Needless to say, we won't be returning, and will have to continue our search for better happy hour elsewhere.

It was crowded and those waiting at reception were backed up so I seated my self in front of the draft bank at the bar.  I was promptly greeted by Mathew, whom inquired as to my drink preference and offered a menu.  I was directly in front of a Brewhouse Brand tap called Jeremiah Red.  It looked appealing so I asked for it.  Mathew asked if I had ever had it before and my negative response prompted him to pour a good sized taste.  It was like something familiar I had before but couldn't place at that instance.  My comment to the bartender was, ""this is very drinkable."" Almost as quick as I mentioned this my salad appeared, and in a few more brief moments my triple decker sandwich was in front of me.  Both were excellent, and I sipped some, but didn't pay too much attention to my ale.  After the heavy duty chow down was finished, I had time to pay attention to the beer.  It dawned on me that it is nearly identical to one of my favorite pub beers in England.  It was either McCaffery's or Caffery's Irish Cream Ale.  Then I noticed the tap had in small letters Irish style ale.   Food was really good service was quick and friendly price was fair.   As I paid and tipped, I told my new bartender friend that the beer alone will bring me in again whenever I'm in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=100

After I flagged down the waiter who had been no where in site, he said ""ohhhhh sorry I'll go check"" then came back 5 mins later and said ""the kitchen is making it right now"" then walked away.. MEANING that he forgot to put it in. He didn't even apologize again and 2nd pizza was brought out 5 mins later.

This location was quite dead for the lunch crowd at the time, very quiet. Atmosphere was great and the place was really top notch clean. Service was outstanding, our waiter was great about offering the lunch specials and really catered to keeping our ice tea's full. I went with my usual lunch special of the chicken tacos with a side of black beans. You really can't beat the price of $5.95 for a good sized lunch. My coworker ordered the ham sandwich lunch special, but also wanted to try the Twisted BLT salad on the side which peaked my interest to try one also. The twisted BLT salad was a really good salad which came with spinach, boiled egg, bacon, cheese and bits of corn. Definitely better than getting a plain ole house salad. This location of BJ""s Brewhouse was a great place to stop in for lunch and their prices definitely beat their competition out in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=140

Came in with a party of 7 on a Sunday (9/25) around 6:30. Was told it would be about 20-25 minutes to be seated. 45 minutes later and we were still waiting. I asked the hostess at the door how much longer it would take and she tells us another 15-20 minutes. At this point my family was hungry and not willing to wait so I asked to sit at one of the tables that were clearly open. And the hostess gives me THE WORST attitude staying ""well you guys won't fit there but you can try"". I'm a nice person and I've worked service jobs so I've dealt with rude people - so I didn't give attitude back but I made it clear that this was not okay. Dude, at this point we're just trying to eat and go - we could have left and let you guys lose $200 (which is what we spend on average when dining at BJs). They finally get us seated at a table but not without attitude from the hostess and whomever the manager on duty was (he was wearing a blue colored shirt). Our waiter was extremely nice and attentive. But our food took close to another hour to come out which I don't understand because at this point, half of the restaurant was empty (it was 8:40 at this point). And to top it off, most of our food was cold. Def not cool. It tasted as if our food sat there for 20 minutes.

I ordered a chicken alfredo pasta plate and also felt that the pasta was very bland hand had no taste. I've had sandwiches and burgers from here before, and have always felt satisfied. For some reason their main dishes seem to fall flat. The reason this recent visit was so disappointing was because the drinks and appetizers we had ordered were amazing!

I'm a patient person so I can wait BUT to make me wait then give me crappy food and bad service just to over charge me for all of it is NOT OK.

There were plenty of empty tables, however none of them were clean. We stood around for a few minutes waiting for someone to offer to clean a table for us. Servers kept walking by, but nobody offered to help us, so I went back to the hostess to ask her instead. She was very nice about it and told me she would send someone over, but nobody came. After standing in the bar for another five minutes or so without being helped, we decided to bus our own table and grab menus from other empty tables. Nobody ever apologized or offered to wipe the table that we ended up bussing ourselves. Once we sat down, everything seemed to happen in slow motion --the service definitely wasn't fast. My strawberry margarita tasted like it didn't have any alcohol in it, but the carnitas fries were SO good. They came in a mini pizza pan with fries on the bottom and all the toppings on top. The only negative experience with the food is that we didn't get silverware. I had to track down my server, and when she finally came with silverware, she only brought one set which didn't make sense because there were clearly three of us.

We were made to feel unwelcome and if she could care less if we stayed or walked out the door.  That said, we stayed. After that encounter, we had a waitress who was unpleasant and got my drink order wrong twice.  Meanwhile, I saw her chatting it up with a fellow employee at their register work station rather then bringing me my correct drink from the bar.  About 15 minutes into our dining experience, our waitress told us that she would be leaving and a new waiter would be taking care of us from that moment forward.  We were all fine with that, no loss there whatsoever.   Our new waiter seemed to be preoccupied about something else other than his customers as well.  It was at that time that I began to notice that most ALL of the employee's were walking around the dining room area looking as if they just got their butts chewed by the Boss or they all just simply did not want to be at work that day? It was kind of a bummer because my wife and I had been at this same restaurant about a month prior and all was very good on that day.

Richard P.,"San Diego, CA",13,20,43,1.0,6/10/2015,"The spaghetti was overcooked so it was somewhat mushy. It had no firmness at all. As far as the marinara sauce it tasted very good but the chef did not put enough sauce so it tasted bland. Fortunately, I brought it up to my bartender who was more than happy to bring an extra side of marinara sauce which I was thankful to her for.  Afterward, I ordered the brussels sprouts. It was my first time ordering that dish. It tasted burned. However, I assumed that that was the smoky flavoring mentioned in the description. After a while though I could no longer tolerate the strong taste and I pointed it out to my bartender and I asked her if it was me or was the Brussels sprouts burned? She looked at it and thought it looked burned as well. She tested the aroma and said that it did smell burned. She brought it up to the other bartender who confirmed that it was in fact burned.  Although I was not charged for the dish, I was quite disappointed as I really like brussels sprouts. I really enjoy coming to the bar at this restaurant but this is the first time that the quality of the food was really bad.

Julissa P.,"Chula Vista, CA",45,4,,4.0,12/26/2016,"My boyfriend and I have been to this restaurant quite a few times when it's slow and everything has been awesome! No waiting time and the service is great as well. However, today I came in with my mom and sister in celebration of my mom's birthday. The restaurant was packed and looked busy. It was a 30-45 minute wait which was fine. However, we noticed that multiple people that came in after us started getting seated before us, so I went to ask when was our turn. Turns out the hostess forgot about us and did not  write my name down for a table... I didn't make a big deal about it because I understand people forget. Also, I felt bad for the hostess because one of the servers was being really rude to her. Demanding her to do her bill? Or do something for her. She was talking down on her. And I think that's not right for a co-worker to try to intimate another co-worker. So, other than that the food was great! There was a wait for the appetizer and food but once again not a big deal for me. It wasn't until there was a 30 minute wait for the dessert? Kind of made me not want it anymore. But I brought up the issue to my server and he offered to speak to the manager. It's not what I wanted of course but he did it anyways. All I wanted was an explanation. But the manager ended up taking off the dessert! Which was really nice of them to do.  To sum it up, I recommend coming during the week between 1-4pm.

This had always been our go to place after work for happy hour because they had great prices on appetizers, drafts, and cocktails. That's changed, unfortunately, along with the quality of drinks and service. All I got I was sugary syrup and ice, and charged for items that were never ordered! Also, our waiter didn't really check up on us and at least 20 mins or more would go by between our drink order and delivery. We were here for about five hours! That's ridiculous when we are only a few feet from the bar. I'm very disappointed mostly because my friends and I kind of had an emotional attachment to this place. We've bonded here and have enjoyed really delicious food, but all that's gone down the drain after tonight. I've also been to the BJs at Grossmont Center with my family and the service isn't that much better. What's going on?! Food is delicious, service is ""eh"", and service recovery (when something goes wrong, it needs to be corrected) definitely needs improvement.  Story time: My mom and I came to have lunch here a while ago: There were crayons on the floor in the middle of the walkway and my mom slipped, fell, and hit her head on the floor as we were being walked to our table. She was hurt, so embarrassed and so upset that hostess didn't offer any sort of compensation. I was the one who picked up the crayons off the floor and no other staff or manager came to check up on her.

This is a really good option for groups of 8 or more- They do well here with a multi - server approach, and generally get food out pretty quickly. One drawback can be limited parking at the CV Center, but it's not too bad. I recommend asking for seating in the elevated areas and not down below; it can get loud and you'll have a ton of people weaving by you to use the restrooms.  Overall, this is a great dining option post work or Christmas shopping.  Tasty!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=220

The second round of drinks was again slow they seem to be zig zagging and it just turned out that I was on the other side of the zig zag. The food was ok.

They have an excellent Sunday Brunch.  We come here to escape the over 1 hour wait in Eastlake at Broken Yolk, Cheesecake factory, and IHOP after church Sunday rush brunch.  It is empty on a Sunday morning and it's perfect for a large group.   I highly recommend the Breakfast Pizza, something unique & filling.  It's enough to share with 3 adults.  HUGE portion.  It's unique and  so heavy that the thin crust will bend over since it can't support the toppings of bacon, sausage, cheese, ham, tomato, & mozzarella.  Bust out the knife and fork for that slice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=220

Mollie N.,"Chula Vista, CA",213,77,357,1.0,5/28/2015,"I come to this BJ's location fairly frequently, and yesterday's service is the WORST I have received here. Arrived at 2:40 PM.  Light customer load, enough waitstaff and hostesses present. Placed order for a party of 2 in the dining area. Order = stuffed baked potato (potatoes are already baked, only need warmed and toppings put on) and soup with salad.  Very easy order to prepare and serve, wouldn't you agree? Waited 25 minutes for our pre baked potato, pre made soup and lettuce.   Our waitress was more concerned with walking around as slow as a snail, talking with other staff, cashing out previous checks, taking new orders at other tables but only delivering drinks No napkin/silverware delivered, at all.  My friend had to go to the hostess to get it. I saw our waitress watching this happen, but she made no attempt to approach our table.  A DIFFERENT waiter brought out the soup and salad, but no baked potato.   I asked him to please bring it as it was missing from the order, and to place the potato in a carryout container. He agreed and brought it to the table immediately.  Not sure why he could bring that out so quickly in a to-go container versus a plate with the rest of the order so I could eat it, but whatever. Waitress never checked on us, but walked past our table several times. Stopped the waitress and asked for our check.  That was the only thing she brought promptly. My friend asked for another bowl of salad (since it is of course, all-you-can-eat soup and salad).  Waitress agreed but was perturbed. No salad came out.  Ever.  I watched her the entire time from my friend's request for more.  Instead, she did other things. My friend asked for a to-go container.  Though we were within 20 feet of a server's station with to-go containers in the cabinet, our waitress went to other areas of the restaurant (but not other customers, just other areas).  Never to return again...until my friend went to the hostess to ask for a to-go container and the hostess went straight to the server's station near us and gave one to my friend.  ONLY then, did our waitress come out from wherever, but NOT to our table...oh no...but to the hostess stand to loudly complain to the hostess how we were bad customers, wanting too many things. (Ahem..not too much to ask for when we ask for silverware, the missing part of our order, our check, another helping of all-you-can-eat salad and a to-go container.  I didn't know that was beyond what a customer should request?  And we never even asked for our food while waiting 25 minutes...thought we were pretty patient about that.) Still no second helping of salad anywhere to be found.   Our waitress never walked to the kitchen once.  I kept my eyes on her the entire time since my friend's order. So we got up to leave (yes, we paid our promptly-brought bill) and our waitress saw us, and still made no attempt to move toward us from the server station at the back of the restaurant.  But, she DID manage to give us the stink-eye as we were leaving. So gracious of her. At least the cold soup and the room temperature salad still had some taste to it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=220

Kassi S.,"Issaquah, WA",133,129,78,3.0,5/9/2014,"I came here on the suggestion of a friend the first time and have been back again since then. I have only tried their deep dish pizzas, but my husband had their top sirloin as well. The deep dish pizzas are DIVINE; that's the truth! On the other hand, their prices and the attitudes of the waitresses are the exact opposite. THE GOOD: Yes, the deep dish pizzas are to die for. They are baked to perfection with large amounts of toppings and the crust gets to the perfect crispy goodness. THE BAD: Expect to pay $14 for a personal pizza and upwards of $20+ for a small, mediocre piece of steak. THE OTHER BAD: The service and attitudes of the waitresses were crummy both times that I've been here. I understand that you're busy and don't really care about me, but if I ask you what's your favorite dish between my two picks or I ask you how your day has been going, please don't roll your eyes or huff and puff because I'm asking your opinion or just making small talk. I also understand that people have off days and some days just plain suck, but until the person who waits us is not in a standoff mood, I'm leaving my review as three stars. Chances are, I'll continue to come back to BJ's regardless of the wait staff and the price... Those deep dish pizzas are worth it. **TIP: Last time we came in, they offered us a rewards card. Kind of like Red Robin's reward program, each dollar you spend at BJ's you earn 1 point. They culminate until you have a certain amount and you can get a % off your ticket, free dessert, etc, etc, etc. Worth it if you go here more than two times probably. **",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=220

I have visited many BJ's and I love the food. However, this one was completely off. First of all, when I walked in, I was not greeted was not asked How many people. When I approached and reception table the lady completely ignored me and I don't know if she wrote anything down or even know we even existed. Once seated at the table. It was 20 mins before any waiter came and greeted our table. (I was about to walk out). Our waiter was completely rude and unprofessional. We had to ask 3 maybe 4 times just to get our drinks and silverware. Now for the food. Like I have said before, BJ's food is awesome. But we had orders two soups and I asked For mine in a bread bowl. My boyfriend and I got the same soup and and there was a night and day difference between ours soups. Mine was warm, steamy and good. His was luke warm and you can tell it had been siting out. We asked to get a new one and they took it back and when brought a ""new one"" it was probably the same one. Lastly, when we were paying we put our gift card of $30 and then a $20 bill to finish it off. For a person that works in food industry one should know to take the money from the gift card and then the cash. NOoope. They took the cash first then the card. We got $7 back on the card... We asked the waiter why he did the transaction that way. And he couldn't give us a reason. When we asked to re do the transaction. He said he couldn't.

I have had this pizza on several occasions and at the La Jolla location, and this was the worst I've ever had. The pizza was luke warm, the crust was still doughy, and the chicken tasted as if it were over cooked in a microwave. I've had frozen meals better than that.  My mother had the new lobster tacos. Somehow they managed to miss the mark with that as well. The lobster tasted rubbery, among the lack of fresh ingredients on the taco, the store bought flour tortillas, and the runny ""guacamole.""

One thing I was craving for going to eat at BJs, a deep dish cheeseburger pizza.  Mind you, this was at 7pm on a Sunday evening.  The first blow was that they tell us that they ran out of deep dish pizza!!!  Umm... really, you ran out of something that you are quite known for.  So they try to make us feel better by telling us that they will give us 2 large regular pizzas since we ordered a large deep dish that was half and half.  Fine, it felt like a good enough compensation but that was STRIKE TWO! Then came the shift change.  I am never a fan of shift change.  Service would always drop 50% during a shift change.  No strike here, just dislike that one fact. So when it came time for dessert, another thing that we were craving for.  We ordered a pizookie that was split half and half chocolate chip cookie and their new flavor oreo.  Well, guess what, the ""temporary"" server came back after about 5 minutes to tell us that they ran out of chocolate chip cookie.  Are you serious... was the look on our faces when our ""temporary"" server told us.  What can we do, we went with another flavor.  Red Velvet cookie.  STRIKE THREE!  They should be out by now, but wait..... So here is the icing on top of the already Three Strike cake.  I don't know, but in every restaurant that I've pretty much been to, when you order dessert, its a given assumption that everyone in the Table would share.  Well our table had 5 people but we got 4 spoons.  So we waved our server to ask for another spoon.  Would you believe that his response to us was ""we ran out of small spoons and they had to put a load in the wash"".  So we looked at the spoons that he gave us, 2 small dessert spoons and 2 soup spoons.  Did they go to San Diego zoo to borrow the monkeys that's running / managing this location??? That's 4 STRIKES for this place. To Management:  Please tell me if you were sitting in our booth and was given the excuses and service we were given, would YOU like it??!?!  If you tell me yes, I will shake your hand because I would like to congratulate you for being an idiot. I rarely give 1 stars.  But this was just ridiculous!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=260

First off, while eating our appetizer's, the server spilled a drink all over my wife's lap. He apologized profusely so I didn't give it a second thought at the time.  We moved over two tables because a couple had just departed from the table next to us and it hadn't been cleaned off yet.  After the staff cleaned up the mess that the drink made, they left the wet towels along with the dishes of the departed guest on that table the entire time we were there eating. My wife had the Cajun chicken pasta and I had the chili stuffed potato.  The food was good, but again here we are looking at the wet towels and dirty dishes while we are eating. When the check came, I was amazed that they didn't give us a discount for the problems we had to deal with.  The result of all of it was a $0.00 tip.  We won't be going back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=260

The second was alright and the third was great. Now just experiencing the 4th time I'm on the fence. I think it really depends on the day that you go and who is in the kitchen.

Customer service needs work, their pazookie never disappoints but their food at this location can be a hit or miss. We come here because it's closer to our house but we seem to receive better service and the quality of food is a huge difference at the La Mesa location. I asked for a fork, the first waitress who wasn't our original waitress (she was serving our food) told me their weren't any and all they had were plastic forks. Our waitress (who has been serving us all night) came to our table with a fork and butter knife wrapped inside the napkin. Once I opened it I was in total disgust and in disbelief of what I saw! There was food on the fork as if it's never been cleaned! Whoever is reading this, please take the time to look at your silverware and not just BJ's but any restaurant! We were so grossed out we asked to use plastic forks. The manager came to our table and said ""I heard there was a dirty utensil, can I see it? I'll talk to my bus boy"" and that was it!

We ordered an appetizer and also our dinner. 25 minutes later we are served our food, which is typical wait time in a good restraunt for your dinner, and this is why you order appetizers...which arrived after our food was served. I ordered a med rare top sirlion, and I received a med well-well. I asked if they could please remake my steak, med well was not what I ordered. When our food was first brought out, I asked for steak sauce which was never brought until after my remade steak was brought out, which took an additional 20. My friends had all finished their meals by this this, and our waiter apologized and said my steak would be taken off our ticket. I asked for more silverware as the first set went back with the first steak, and the waitress again, never brought silverware, I had to use my friends. At the end of this horindous ordeal, I was still charged for my steak. I was actually charged for 2 steaks and one was taken off and when I asked the waiter why, she had told me I wouldn't be charged for it...her reply was yes, they took off the one I sent back...did they really expect me to pay for one they had to remake for their mistake??? I could understand if the service was so poor because they were busy or short staffed but definitely not the case!!! As I patiently waited for my meal the second time, I watched 5 employees, including the manager,work together at 1 table doing closing work, (which was 3 hours before they close) as in rolling the dinnerware setups, etc., while ignoring their customers, which should be #1.

Carlene R.,"San Diego, CA",107,384,565,3.0,7/2/2011,"I have been to BJ's numerous of times and I am surprised I have not wrote a review about this place.   Appetizers   3/5 My favorite appetizer is their avocado egg rolls.  These appetizers are a bit sinful because their main ingredient is avocado and it is fried.  It's kind of like biting into deep fried avocados in the Del Mar Fair, but with more flavor. Pizza   3/5 I know the deep dish pizza is mediocre compared to the ones in Chicago, but these pizzas are all right.  My favorite is the Mediterranean and the Sweet Pig. Pizookie   5/5 I usually get the white macadamia nut or the double chocolate, but I guess all of the pizookies are all worth it.   Beer  4/5 My personal favorite is the Nutty Brewnette and the Harvest Hef because I like nutty and wheat tasting beer.  I have yet to try the Jeremiah Red.  I don't like the Nit Wit.  It has an unusual after taste.  However, if you do like a citrus taste with a weird after taste, then get this beer.   Service   3/5 Service is a hit or a miss.  Sometimes the waiter or waitress will be attentive to your needs.  Other times they will only visit you four or five times (get drinks, take your order; say, ""How is everything?"" and give the bill) or ignore you for the whole night.  I like going to BJ's on the weekdays late at night because it is open seating near the bar and the service is better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=280

Our server was, Corina. She struggled with a thick accent, but that was the least of her pitfalls. When our order started to arrive on the table she was MIA,  for 20 minutes thereafter, MIA. When the food arrived by unpleasant food runners, our meals were shlepped in front of us. Side dishes almost sliding off our plates- Such a turn off.    Finally, a manager came over and settled our outstanding requests for missing meals, steak sauce, and drink refills. He was very helpful. But when our dinner had been sitting 20 minutes already, it was too little, too late. I was really embarrassed.  Thankfully, my family just laughed it off and didn't make a public scene.

Lots of choices for non alcohol drinkers like me. Cream Soda was mmm! Only bad thing is that they serve Pepsi products instead of Coke. Love the Pizookie dessert. A nice warm cookie type dessert with ice cream. It's a nice sweet treat.  Also in the past when they were running their $20 special. You had a choice of two small pizzas a salad and the pizookie dessert. That was a great deal. Don't know if they're still offering that. I didn't ask the on 11/12/11 because I wanted to get a burger.

We sat down and was greeted by the bus boy filling our waters, but we waited for what felt like 15 mins or so for our waitress.  They weren't overly busy either, it was about 2pm.  After she finally brought us our drinks, we still had to wait another 10 mins or so to order our appetizers.  I'm not really sure what the hold up was, but it didn't seem to phase our girl.  Good thing I wasn't in a hurry or anything, I wouldn't have been pleased at all. We got the sampler platter to share among us and it had a good selection as well the bites were tasty.  We also got the deep fried artichokes and those were amazing.  For our entree, we each got the salad/pizza lunch special and I didn't think it was that great.  When you think a half and half combo, you would think you would get more than 2 leaves for your salad and your flatbread pizza wouldn't be so pathetic looking, but not here.

I love their French toast.  -Huge dining area and the layout works really well and is very inviting. Cons: -Though they seem to have a lot of employees walking around, when it gets busy the wait at the table for someone to come over can be lengthy at times.  -During football or happy hour it is difficult to find someone to clear a dirty table in the bar section.  -When the restaurant gets busier, the quality of the food seems to suffer.

JR S.,"Vista, CA",1,43,,1.0,11/17/2015,Worst BJ'S I've been to. Seems like it's typical in Chula Vista to recieve crappy service. Bjs is another place to Stay away from in CV. My waiter was unpleasant my food was cold and my sampler was supposed to be a variety but because they were out of some of the things on the variety deep fried appetizer I was brought out cheese sticks. I didn't ask for cheese sticks. I asked for the sampler. Not paying for this meal. You can't just substitute things without asking a customer and then expect it to be ok. Horrible all the way around.

I remember when football season was on, my friends and I were trying to watch a game and none of the TVs had audio. It was wack! And, they told us we had to be quite because it was family a restaurant. Booo! Your showing the football playoffs and you serve alcohol! What do you expect? Dumb-asses!

Robert B.,"San Diego, CA",0,15,,2.0,6/16/2012,"Went to BJ's the other evening with my wife and youngest daughter.  It wasn't my first choice.  I had been there some time ago and wasn't particularly impressed with the place but my daughter wanted to go, so I gave in.  The menu is pretty extensive, so I figured I'd find something good. The best thing about BJ's (in my opinion) is their extensive selection of beers.  If you are a beer drinker, then you will surely find something tasty here.  Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for the food. The waiter showed up quickly and took our order.  I don't know what's going on, whether there is a new trend in the food service industry or what but servers used to write down the orders.  Its really impressive when someone can actually remember all of the stuff that we order without writing it down, but not so cool when they don't.  Our waiter wasn't as cool as he thought he was. I ordered a medium gourmet five meat deep dish pizza.  The picture looked delicious, and I'm a sucker for deep dish pizza.  I really wanted to love this pizza, but what I actually got did not even come close to meeting my expectations.  It was deep dish all right, about 2 inches thick.  There was also plenty of meat, and the meat tasted pretty good.  My problem was that there was very little else between the meat and bread.  There was a little bit of cheese, but not even close the bubbling pile of deliciousness that BJ's depicts in their photo.  And sauce?  Apparently BJ's don't need no stinkin' sauce.  What I got (for 20 bucks mind you) was basically a piece of bread with meat sprinkled around on top.  Very dry and not at all satisfying. My wedge salad was good, but let's face it - it's hard to mess up a quarter head of lettuce with dressing on top of it.  My wife enjoyed her tomato and whatever salad too.  The hot wings were pretty decent too, once the order was sorted out and we actually got them.  We also ordered some sort of fried artichoke thing that never did arrive... Some of the food arriving at other tables looked pretty good.  My pizza sucked.  Its a good thing I didn't order the large.  Should have skipped the pizza and just drank beer...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=340

Then the following conversation happened... Hostess ""Table or booth?"" Me ""Booth please"" Hostess ""Oh all the booths are dirty"" Wife ""We can wait, we prefer a booth"" Hostess, ""Well, don't know how long before they are clean, will be a while. Go check up at the bar area and come back to let me know if there are any open"" She said all this with an attitude, like we were bothering her for making her do her job. As we walked up to the bar area you could see the main floor where 5+ tables were dirty with messy dishes. By the time we got up to the bar I was ticked off and decided to leave. My wife stayed behind to speak with a manager because we don't like to leave a bad review with out making the manager aware of the situation. The manager was just as bad as the hostess. He only looked at my wife with a blank stare and asked if we wanted the table wiped down.

About, half way done the manager came with the meetballs. Again, i asked the manager for water and he said ""I'll be back for the water!"" But no, he goes out and desides to do something else than having to come back for the water. But, at least the waiter was genres and sorry for keeping us waiting.

One of the appetizers we ordered came out wrong, we wanted the brussel sprouts with the cream sauce on the side, and again he was quick to blame the kitchen staff.

When he finally did bring out my dinner and the other missing dinner, they were both wrong. I understand that everyone has off nights but we were really disappointed.

Not even a little apologetic about how long it took for everything including how long it took us to even be greeted.  The 1 star is for Amanda the bartender and also the food runner that brought me some ranch.

I ordered avocado egg rolls they were okay and that's saying a lot . My husband ordered angus sliders umm please even at 5 dollars for that is too much I was cracking up looking at the picture of the sliders on the menu and what was before me . A 99cent McDouble has more meat then. These two sliders combined you can't even see the meat outside the bun it's a joke .

Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms-  Was very good they give you 6 for like 3 dollars. Mini-Bruschetta - Was good no complains. The Great thing about BJs Snacks and Small Bites are there they very inexpensive. Dinner Chicken Marsala- Everything was fine except the chicken it was all chewy ""WHAT THE HECK"" This ain't gum baby lol. Had to send it back to replace the chicken with shrimp.

Other than this particular bartender, I had a wonderful experience at BJ's. The waitress was very kind and the food was excellent.

I ordered the full portion saying I'd take the rest home for dinner. Wow - that wasn't going to happen. My salad was smaller than 1/2 salads I've had anywhere else. In fact I asked the server if I had been given the lunch portion accidentally, but she assured me that wasn't the case, stating ""it's just a new dish that makes it look smaller"". Uh huh, real small. There was maybe 1/2 tablespoon of bacon, and 3 thin slices of avocado. I was still hungry when I finished my $12 salad. That's a first.

Eva A.,"National City, CA",23,132,40,2.0,10/12/2010,"So disappointed with this location considering my meal was a solid 4-star worthy. My boyfriend and I walked into this location on a Monday night looking for a meal with the occasional alcoholic beverage. After waiting around for a hostess to appear we were seated and had a good view of various flat screen tvs with the Monday Night Football game on (always a plus).  After looking at the menus the hostess had given us and wondering why we had been sitting there for 10-15 minutes without our sever even coming to our table yet to introduce himself or ask for drinks it finally occurred to the other severs we were staring down that hey, we haven't had any service. Finally our server who shall remain nameless made his way over and asked for our drink order. By that time we were already fully aware of what we wanted to eat so we placed our order and our alcoholic drinks came shortly after.  I ordered the Mango Tango with a Turkey Burger (which came with my choice of thin-cut fries) and my boyfriend ordered an Oktoberfest beer with the Scampi Pasta (which came with garlic bread). My mixed drink didn't taste the greatest with the basil leafs it included but as soon as I took those out the taste improved. The Turkey Burger however was on point, very delicious and the thin-cut fries with ranch dressing is always a winner in my book. My boyfriend enjoyed the brew however his Pasta which I had a bite of was dry and lacked flavor. About this time we were waiting around again for our sever to appear as I was getting thirsty and wanted to order a Diet Soda. However after another 15 minutes of waiting around I finally decided to get up and asked another sever with blonde hair for my drink and apologized for having to ask her but that I had no idea where my sever had went. She gladly brought out my drink and 5 minutes later our sever decided to show up and ask us if we needed anythng which we asked for the check before he could take off again. He informed us his shift was ending and that another waiter would be taking over for him and handling our check. I'm usually a very generous tipper however the service we received from our waiter was terrible that I felt like I shouldn't have left any gratuity (but I did leave a small amount for the drink and quality of the meal). Thank you to the blonde waitress who showed us your courtesy and actually came to our table a few times just to check on us. Next time however we'll get our meals to go or visit another location to dine in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=400

She was very attentive and nice to my boyfriend, but was very rude to me.

He was very friendly and was ontop of everything specially refills!  so i ordered the fettuccini alfredo and the house salad. my croutons tasted like a piece of tofu extemely stale. my friends croutons as well! half of the croutons were good half were like soake in water and chewy. my pasta was decent we also ordered chips and salsa. after the croutons being old i felt like the salsa looked recycled but im pretty sure i was just being paranoid lol  5stars for service but 3 stars on their food.  parking is always good & i'll definitely be back,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=440
Claudia G.,"San Francisco, CA",13,19,,4.0,8/20/2010,"BJ's is always a good time...the hostess and the waitress were all genuinely friendly (this is always a plus because you can't find it everywhere)   Food is always pretty good here too...I ordered the strawberry lemonade and it was ok.. I've had better (no strawberries but other than that it was good) I also ordered the grilled chicken club and it was delish, wedge cut fries were also pretty darn good.  My friends ordered the southwestern deep dish pizza and OMG it was pretty amazing...I'm plain and I usually only like pepperoni pizza but this new one is very very yum..an ounce of spiciness and the chicken make it a favorite for me....next time I go i'm ordering it!

ruby w.,"Los Angeles, CA",20,325,688,4.0,12/18/2009,"Friday night and this place was packed with a small crowd waiting to be seated. Our wait was about 15 - 20 minutes, which is not a problem if I had not walked to the bathroom (about 10 minutes in) and notice that there were at least 2-3 empty tables ready to be seated and the hostesses were just holding everyone up.  Our server was nice and courteous and the food is actually decent, but overpriced in my opinion. Good thing we took advantage of the ""Holiday Special"" -- they have a coupon on their front page ( ) Dinner for two which includes soup or salad, one medium deep dish pizza and a choice of pizzokie to share. Not a bad deal considering one medium pizza alone usually runs for about $20.00. So, basically you are getting two soup and a pizzokie on the house.  Clam Chowder -- surprisingly good. Nice and creamy with lots of clams. Overly salty towards the end. Big bowl.   Tomato Bisque -- tasted a lot like spaghetti sauce. Creamy and sweet. Manage to eat about half and I was good.  Great White Deep-Dish (medium) -- like with most deep dish pizzas, it was really bready. I love the toppings -- mushroom, cheese, tomato, with chicken breast. Excellent flavor and filing. Did not look very oily, but I know looks can be deceiving. The pizza had a nice soft and bouncy texture -- like fresh bread. We were each comfortably full with 1 slice each so plenty of leftovers. Chocolate Chunk Pizzokie -- Basically an under-cooked chocolate chip cookie with vanilla bean ice cream. I remember having it once and thought it tasted much better before. Warm cookie dough complemented with vanilla ice cream well. A few bites and you feel that it becomes too sweet. The outer rim is crustier than the middle part. I am officially OVER pizzokies.  Coupon expires 01/08/2010 so hurry in and catch the deal if you love their deep dish pizzas. DM me with your e-mail address if you have trouble accessing  the coupon (they might take it off before it expires).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=440

We ordered the pumpkin ale beer... The told us that the beer was all sold out. Then we tried ordering a ""medium"" white pizza. And guess what? That pizza crust is sold out! So i'm assuming the pizza isn't made fresh. Very disappointing.  The service was horrible as well. They didn't have silverware set up for us. Our food took forever to get and it wasn't really worth the wait. My calzone was gross. It didn't even look like a calzone. It looked more like a pot pie. And the ""small"" white pizza my brothers ordered wasn't great. The chicken wasn't even grill more like microwave. The menu mentioned of alfredo sauce in the white pizza. But there was no sign of it. Really Really Awful.  Lastly, it took several reminders to get our check from the waitress. I've gone to several BJ's and this one is awful! Here's the kicker, it wasn't even that busy.

He just said accidents happen and went on. We do understand that but it was an employee error. A little customer service would've been nice. The second time we went for a Chargers game. Firs, for a bar with huge screens all around, you consider this a sports bar. Well, they never raised the volume because they were a ""Family"" restaurant and they couldn't. Then we ordered a pitcher of beer that took 1 hour exactly to get to our table. When I asked the waiter why he gave attitude saying the bar had problems and they were busy.

I love their beer selection and the happy hour.  I normally sit at the bar with my friend. I love how they have hooks to hang your purse. Check it out if you have not seen that yet. Others than having old men sit next to you at the bar trying to listen to your conversation...and knowing me my conversations can sometimes be inappropriate....having strangers creep up is not cool.  I've had the nachos before and those are just NEVER ENDING. TOO MUCH. I also tried the shrimp tacos and those are def not that good. Only like one shrimp per taco.

The hostess there looked so much like Uma Thurman I almost asked for an autograph!!! The waitress who served us seemed to want to get rid of us as soon as possible...(Maybe because some of us were louder than others)...but still she kinda sucked! I don't like beer whatsoever so I just opted to get a cosmo...typical but they don't have the greatest mixed drink menu because it is a brewhouse. We had some sort of avocado egg roll or something like that....that was pretty good with a little bit of spice to it...for the main course I ordered the balsamic chicken which was very VERY YUMMY!!! And the PIZOOKIE was so fricken GOOD! It made me forget about the waitress for a little while! Overall...I give food a 5 star and service 2.

Jarvis G.,"San Diego, CA",8,24,8,1.0,12/30/2009,"I gave this particular BJs restaurant many chances to redeem themselves, but alas I have come to the conclusion that this place sucks.   I just recently discovered that they do not make their pizza crusts fresh.  My bros ordered a medium pizza and our waitress told us that they ran out of medium pizza crusts!   Apparently, they use frozen pizza crusts and their chefs dont know how to make pizza at all.  Our pizza we ordered was the Mediterrean pizza which tasted like it was microwaved.  It was really soggy in the middle and ingredients used were sub-par.  In addition, my brothers ordered the Great White pizza which claims to have alfredo sauce -- but no alfredo sauce was found in the pizza.  It had a marinara sauce that was disappointing.      The beers we ordered were decent, but they didn't have the pumpkin ale available.  For a place that claims to be a brewery/restaurant, not having a seasonal beer is disappointing. The service was another disappointment.  We split our party in two since we arrived early.  The other party had 15+ people that arrived 15-20 minutes later than we did.  Although, we had a head start in our food and drinks we noticed that we were ignored and the other group was catered and served more than us.  We didn't receive our appetizer plates until after we received our appetizers and our waitress took her sweet time in giving us our check after many requests. After this horrible experience, I wondered what I did to deserve such a punishment.  Avoid this place like its the black plague -- dont be tempted by its bright lights and fancy spinning entrance door.  I really miss the Unos that used to be in Chula Vista Center.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=460

Long waits and substandard food was what we got.  I decided to go with the California Burger since I enjoyed the Bacon Cheeseburger Pizza so much the first time.  What I got was more of a sandwich than a burger.  Bread instead of bun, no lettuce or tomatoes, and the size was pretty pathetic.  The fries were the better part of my meal.  My wife went with the flavorless Cajun Pasta with shrimp & chicken.  They forgot to include the chicken, but didn't forget to charge us for it.

Jeannette C.,"Chula Vista, CA",3,13,1,1.0,5/29/2013,"I generally ALWAYS tip. Even if the service is horrible, I'll at least round out to the nearest whole dollar. However if the service is great I usually tip over 20% This Sunday, May 26th, 2013, I took my little cousin and nephew to BJ's for some ice cream after the movies at the Chula Vista Mall. Personally I dislike this BJ's because they always have TERRIBLE service. Of the 4 times I've been there I think I only had good service once. Still I went in with an open mind cuz we weren't ""hungry"" and it was the closest place to go for some ice cream and I figured 3 desserts wouldn't take long... After sitting there for 7 minutes without a greeting (yes I kept track of the time from the minute we were seated! This ain't my first time at the rodeo. I know their service sucks, I wanted to compare THIS trip to others I've had there) a server who was walking past and noticed the ANNOYED look on my face greeted us and said he'd find our server. I let him know we were just there for dessert and HE graciously took our order (I wish I'd gotten his name so I could at least put ONE positive thing on here!) Another 5 minutes passed before our server appeared and brought us out the water I'd asked for. She then said she'd put in our dessert order and it would be out shortly. So here is the point where I need to clarify a few things.... Number one, the section we were seated in was clearly marked because I saw the server who took our order bouncing between his tables and not crossing the imaginary line until he greeted us. The table behind us was leaving and the only other seated table in our section was already eating. So unless our server was also cooking in the kitchen, our section didn't appear busy, so I have no idea where the heck OUR server was or what on earth she was doing! Number two, I was a server many moons ago. I ordered a warm dessert so it might have needed to be heated up for a few minutes. But the kids literally had 2 scoops of ice cream with whipped cream and chocolate sauce. So from having done it myself in the past I persoanlly know that desserts do not take long to prepare. Which brings me to 25 minutes after we were sat and our server said she'd put in the order for our desserts, they were brought out. The kids loved theirs and mine was disgusting. $6.50 for a bunch of warm berries in a tin with ice cream melting on top of it. I literally had to get up to go look at a menu because I SWORE the description of my dessert included some sort of ""crumble"" in with the berries. Plus I'd had that dessert before. There is usually more to it than just warm berries! At that point I just wanted to leave and not touch anything and not pay but the kids were excited about their sundaes. So I made the decision that I just wouldn't tip. A decision I never make lightly because as I said, I was a server before and remember what that feels like. Since I've been screwed over before where a disgruntled, horrible server over charged my card, I distinctly WROTE out the word ZERO where it says tip on the receipt to avoid any confusion or over charge to my card. This morning, I checked my bank statement and SURE ENOUGH where I had only authorized BJ's to charge $9.45 to my card, they decided it would be ok to round up to $10. I know that's only a 55 cent difference, but I don't care. I didn't authorize that charge and am APPALLED that they had the audacity to feel they can charge me whatever they want even though I SPECIFICALLY signed a statement saying I would authorize a lesser charge. So not only will I be calling my bank and filing complaint of a FRAUDULENT charge to my card. I am going to personally walk in to BJ's this afternoon and speak to the manager in the hopes that at the very least our server ""Jessica"" will be reprimanded for her theft, if not Fired!  I can't believe someone would jeopardize their job over 55 cents!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=460

The second server copped an attitude when we informed her we wanted separate checks and said ""You should've told me before I got the final check for your table.""  We informed her we told the first server that and she said she never got that message.  Wow.  Slow ass service with an attitude to boot.  Too bad I'm most likely never coming back here.  That rude server at the end pretty much killed any points this restaurant had left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=460

I had such an awesome time here(mostly due to wacky friends and outrageous jokes), but the food was quite good and the drinks were amazing. I ordered a sourdough burger with fries and a root beer. The burger was good, but I have to point out that the root beer was quite possibly the best root beer I've ever had. It was amazing and almost... creamy. The waitress did point out that it was also brewed on site. The service was good and fast. The host seated us in a nice booth right away. Our waitress was attentive and friendly. She would return on occasion to ask if there was anything else we would like. The only minus worth mentioning was the wait for the food. We did keep asking ourselves when our food was going to get there, but the root beer and beer kept us happy. Oh, and I don't remember seeing any silverware or napkins on the table. We really didn't need any for our food (hand-food), so we didn't ask, but it's a given that you need silverware and napkins at any restaurant. I do remember having to wipe my mouth with the bar napkin. The ambiance, decor and entertainment was very pleasing. Very, very nice looking restaurant. I dig.

Rob Z.,"Chula Vista, CA",1,4,,3.0,4/11/2009,"Upon reading all of the derogatory remarks/reviews on the local BJs I thought I would add some insight of my own, having been there a few times I feel that I can now give an honest review. The food can be hit or miss dependant on who is in the kitchen I suppose but overall the food alone would get 3 stars. Pizzas are decent , and the hh can offer some tasty and filling choices that won't deplete wallet. Atmosphere is cool and definately welcome for good ol Chula Juana. Bjs atmosphere/decor is above the other chain restaurants within the same price range ala Chilis,Applebees and such. One can come here hang out and not see roaches or other disgusting things in plain view. Service like most say is  sub-par for the most part. Some waiters/waitresses seem like they are all coked out and sweating which can ruin your appetite. The managers, for that matter, seem inexperienced and can be heard talking about their subordinates at times which is completely unprofessional. There are acceptions to the manager/servers situation because not all of them are totally unproffesional and incompetent. On one of my first visits I had a server(I think her name was Laura or something) that was super cool and personable. Things seemed super hectic but she handled business and we never had to waive her down or ask for constant refills (which can sometimes be problematic). Other times have not been so easy going, some people should just not be in the business. Overall I will probably go back to BJs if I'm in that part of Chula and have not eaten in a day or two. The service and food can be hit or miss,its kind of a crapshoot but they do play lots of 80s songs (the cool 1s) over the speakers which constitutes for 1 whole star entirely on its own.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=480

My friends and I were in Chula Vista when we noticed they had just opened a BJ's there. We decided that we didn't want to sit down and eat so we went to their take-out desk and ordered food. The lady at the counter, I believe her name was Courtney, was super nice. I had gone to BJ's twice prior to this visit and will only get the BBQ pizza but I have never had a pizookie. I asked my friends and the lady at the counter if they were worth getting at the take out and she told me they were. Lets just say the PIzookie was AMAZING. I asked if I could get it while I was waiting for the rest of the food, so that the cookie could be hot and the ice cream cold, and they were nice enough to do that.

Until recently, my bf took me to the BJ's for dinner in Chula Vista, CA and as we went in, the restaurant did not have that much people - I don't know if its because its during a weekday or just a slow day. I thought it was kind of nice and relaxing because it wasn't so busy therefore the service on on top of there game. We ordered the glazed chicken with mashed potatoes, spinach, and grilled string onions and that was OMG! DELICIOUS!!! The mashed potatoes was soft and buttery!!

What I'm unsure about is if I should drop this a star or not.  I'll be giving the benefit of the doubt because some people enjoy this type of customer service. (The whole reason why Dick's last resort makes ton of cash.) The server pretty much dissed my experience with dark beers.  I can understand questioning me once or maybe even twice about ordering the Tatonka Stout but 4 or 5 times? WTF?! I had to retort by saying ""You see how dark I am? I drink beers as dark as I am!"" Ugh Ok, so 4 stars because Tatonka was rich and creamy.  Deliciously sweet, multi layered in flavors, and rolls over your tongue in a very satisfying manner. Update: Sliders were good, cajun pasta was super creamy and I felt 10 pounds heavier after my meal. So I'm looking at everyone's complaints about the inexperienced and bad service.  Maybe I'm just lucky? Even though there was a shift change in the middle of our meal we were well looked after.  At point a server accidentally broke an empty plate and the drunk table next to us got the entire place to whoop n holler but she seemed unfazed by the rude customers.   The place was packed with 4 birthdays on the floor and all the bar stools taken but I didn't notice any of the things everyone else complained about. so yeah... maybe I just went on a night where all the good staff was on duty?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=480

Our host greeted and promptly seated us right away which was nice.  The place was definitely bigger in space compared to the other BJ's I've visited.  Our server was very nice to us and had excellent communication skills as she always made sure we had everything we needed.  At one point she came to drop off some plates at our table, but chose to take those plates back herself numerous times after seeing that the plates she was grabbing weren't quite fully cleaned.  To be honest, I'm glad she caught that rather than myself because I really take little details like that to the next level so kudos to her for being attentive and for keeping our drinks filled ;).  If it is one thing I can't stand, that would be not being given a refill or even being asked for one.  She definitely made sure we weren't being ignored and I was quite surprised to see everyone working closely as a team.  My server had people helping her bring our orders and even boxed our pizza up for us which at another location was never done before so hopefully they keep up this kind of service.   Their root beer was so good! It was smooth and didn't have much of a crazy fizz like all the other root beers out there. I decided to skip out on the bar as I wanted to take a break from that and just enjoy the good food they had.  After having a sampler, I was pretty stuffed.  The pizza was super good as well!

The 3 star night it was a little crowded and my sampler platter tasted like maybe it was gasp...all frozen foods. I'm not sure if it is frozen food but it was just mediocre.

We were a party of 19 on a Friday night, and they do not take reservations, so we were expecting quite a wait. The hostesses told us an hour and a half to two hours. Which was fine, my brother in law really wanted to eat here for his birthday. However, what I don't understand is that there was an entire row of tables left open. My sister asked why we could not be seated there, the hostess told her that they had a waiting list. We absolutely understood that, however, no one was there longer than we were. So, my sister tried to ask if we could be seated there but the hostess said ""no, that's for people on the waiting list. We are waiting on one more table to open up in the middle so we can seat you."" Just a thought, the tables are not stuck together are they? Because as far as we could see, the tables in the middle were separated as well, therefore I don't see why we couldn't be accommodated first seeing as how we had waited for the longest time. There were not many people waiting any how and tables were available. Do you see the problem? The manager did not even wear a name tag. Horrible service.

Desi N.,"San Diego, CA",64,351,10,4.0,8/13/2012,"My first trip to B.Js was long over due! I was almost convinced that it was another simple franchise like AppleBees or T.J.I Friday serving bland food for low prices. When I came in, I was quite impressed at how nice and clean the restaurant was. It reminded me of being in a replica of a more updated Cheesecake Factory minus the wide selection of Cheesecake and the optional outdoor seating area. The employees were all busy and kept up well with hosting and serving everyone which really made my lunch more enjoyable! I had an awesome server whose name I did not get but everytime I drank my water down to the ice, he was right next to me filling my glass up. I never once needed to call for him or go through numerous failed attempts to get his attention. He was right where I could see him and frequently asked was everything fine. It sure was - from the seating, the atmosphere, the service, to the great company and delicious food! Restaurants' wide ranged menus always make ordering difficult for me but not at B.Js. I did not waste much time trying to figure out what I wanted because nothing stood out more to me than the Salads and the under 450 calories menu. Eating healthy has become a trend and it's definitely one I can't complain about! Right away I knew I wanted the Ahi Seared Salad. I had no idea what to expect but my judgment was on point for once! My taste buds and I were extremely satisfied after lunch here! The salad looked like something from a well known and appreciated recipe book. There's nothing I enjoy more than detail and almost perfect decor on my plate. The chef must have been in a great mood. I was content that I was served very fresh leafy greens as opposed to the usual non nutritional valued iceberg lettce. The avocado balanced well with the freshness of the greens, sauce and the lightly seared ahi. I enjoyed it to the last bite and remember thinking how I couldn't wait for my next lunch at B.Js. What took me so long to try it out? I have no idea. It's now my new favorite lunch spot until I'm proven otherwise. The drinks mounted on the walls made me want to stay for a Happy Hour but I'm not much of a drinker and wouldn't want to be tipsy in the mall. By the way, I recall saying outloud to my friend who ordered delicious avocado rolls how the music choice was great! Two of my favorite songs played back to back. Billy Idol - ""Rebel Yell, and Red Hot Chili Pepper's ""Give It Away Now"" ... Who doesn't like those two songs??? Experience was excellent! Reason for 4 stars is because it's not exactly a 5 star restaurant but very close in my opinion! Look forward to coming back! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=500

The only other BJs I'd had ever been to was the tiny one in La Jolla which is always packed with students from UCSD. Service this night was normal. The place was only about 15-20% full, so it wasn't too busy nor loud.  Ordered the buffalo wings for appetizer, since there wasn't any other appetizer on the menu I wanted to try.  I ended up being plesantly suprised. The wings were fried to a crispy perfection and drizzled lightly with ranch and sour/spicy sauce. It was served with celery and side servings of the ranch and sour/spicy sauce, unlike many other restaurants who drench the wings in the sour/spicy sauce when served. It's easier for each person to control how spicy the wings are for each person this way. For the main entree, had the great white, which was a cheese based deep dish pizza with tomatoes and spices.  This is a popular pizza here.  I liked it's soft and fluffy texture, unlike the oily and hard deep dish pizza Unos serves.

I knew my customer service was going to be sub par. We walked in and there was no hostess. There was a group of 5 servers standing in the back and no one even acknowledged that we were there. After about four minutes of standing there a server (that was actually working) walked by with a plate and said that someone was going to be right with us.  We were seated and ordered from a less than friendly waitress. I had the soup, half sandwich, and thin cut fries with a side of ranch. I didn't get the kind of soup I ordered, but I let it go because they brought out my second choice.  The food was okay. My main complaint was with my waitress, I understand that you have to turn your tables over, but two people at a booth don't need their plates cleared every five minutes. And my ranch didn't even come out until my meal was 1/2 way consumed. I had actually had food in my hand when my waitress grabbed my plate and asked me if I was done.

While the English believe in warm beer, I don't. Why does my beer have to sit at the bar waiting by it's lonesome? (The second time, I was there I almost got up to get my own beer but my darling wife whacked me in the shin).  Does beer get better with age? Afraid not.  Been there twice so the terrible service is not an anomaly. Sorry, I really wanted to like this place. Maybe the next time, I'll just do the restaurant side.

They need someone at the front (and there was 4 of them) who knows what they're doing instead of standing there yawning the whole time we were there!! Very disappointed!!! and all the girl could do in the front was put her head down and say i'm sorry!!!

Cruise L.,"Pearland, TX",0,73,84,5.0,5/12/2011,"Beer! They have beers from all around the world. They also have about a dozen BJ's-brewed beers: 8 regulars and a few seasonals. I recommend for first timers (and beer connoisseurs): TRY THE 9 BEER SAMPLER. They come out arranged from lightest to darkest, so you can get a feel for what fits you. Or you can look here: ( ) My personal favorite: Jeremiah Red. I have been around the world and have tried hundreds of beers and this one beer here at BJ's is my favorite beer of all time (understandably, your tastes may vary). I've been a regular here for the past two years and the thing that keeps bringing me back (besides their BJ's-brewed beers) are the pizzas! Deep dish, fresh ingredients. My personal favorite: The Mediterranean. It comes with grilled chicken, basil pesto, roasted garlic, Kalamata olives, sun-dried tomatoes, feta cheese and sliced peperoncinis. So fresh and so goood. QUICK TIPS: Go during happy hour (3pm - 7pm).  Sit in the bar area. $1 off draft beers & cocktails.  $2 off appetizers. (Chips & Salsa are awesome) HALF of mini-pizzas. Hopefully you will get good service - that seems to be the primary complaint on Yelp here.The only bad service I've had is from the bartenders, who seem to be really slow at placing orders. My server generally has to go ask at least twice. What gives? Also, a guy named Branden is probably the best waiter I've ever had there. That dude is #1 when it comes to service! Sadly, I am moving to Japan for 3 years (Navy) and will not get to enjoy BJ's anymore. So, if anything else, please go have a beer for me, and raise your glass to those serving to protect freedom!

However, this location had the worst staff I have ever seen. I came with a friend to celebrate Mothers Day, we were seated quickly because it was an afternoon, so it was not busy at all. But when we ordered our food with an appetizer to come before our meal, we had to wait 40 MINUTES to get it! Another 20 MINUTES for our entrees. I had somewhere to be afterward so this was truly an inconvenience, but I wish that were the worst part. When they brought out the food, it was cold. Not lukewarm, cold. They brought my friends pizza out WITH A SLICE OF PIZZA MISSING. Who does that!??? The waiter, Lindsey (a male) told me one slice fell off, and shrugged ""I don't know what you want me to do, I can get a manager if you want"". So after waiting for a manager, all he can tell me is ""I just got here...I just walked through the door"" over and over. But contradicted himself after admitting the pizza fell on the floor, than quickly correcting himself, saying it was just the slice that fell. So was he there, or did he just ""walk through the door""?? He was totally inconsiderate. I wish I had got his name. They comped my meals, but I had to pay for my appetizer and alcoholic beverage. The staff at that location are so unprofessional, they seem to have no experience in the food industry, or customer service for that matter. A bunch of kids out of high school.

Joanne B.,"San Diego, CA",1010,663,2397,2.0,2/26/2009,"I had dinner here tonight with some friends and throughout the night while we were there, I kept thinking how half-ass their service was!  Really, it was pretty sad that a nice new restaurant in the mall had terrible service. We arrived and there's already a wait for a table in the very full main dining area on a Thursday night.  That's fantastic for our economy, but screw the wait, we found an open booth in the bar area where seating is open, so that was a good start. Things went south quick though.  Our server reminded me of Drew Barrymore's character in 50 First Dates because homie couldn't remember anything the minute he would walk away from our table.  We had to flag him down several times to take our order, bring us water, bring out the soup my friend ordered before dinner, you get the picture. I only ordered an appetizer and one of their girly beers, my friends had some beer and entrees.  My one friend ordered a French dip sandwich, but he got served a BBQ sandwich of some sort instead.  It already took close to 45 minutes for our food to come out, so he just said f-it and ate it anyway, none of us wanted to wait much longer and they were both hungry boys. I'd go back if they worked out their kinks.  I know they opened less than three months ago, but c'mon, help me help you!  Speed up your service and train your servers to put on their happy faces and I'll give it another shot.   You didn't quite have me at hello, but we'll get there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=380

Emily P.,"Chula Vista, CA",5,91,7,2.0,10/5/2014,"I'm sorry I have to say it but the service here is awful. The restaurant wasn't even busy! I could easily forgive them if it was during the lunch or dinner rush but it was 2pm and there were servers and empty tables everywhere. Still, the service was ridiculously slow and my actual server was not very friendly. He never smiled...not once! Also puzzling to me is why he would serve my 2-year old daughter orange juice in a lowball glass??? Seriously? How odd and thoughtless is that? I had to taste the damn thing just to make sure it wasn't a screwdriver or something. Not to mention the fact that she's not exactly nimble enough to hold a heavy glass like that all by herself. So every time she tried to drink her juice, I had to drop everything and hold it steady for her. Geez! Also, we didn't even get any utensils. I had to ask for them AFTER our food came out. As for our food, my salad came out with no dressing. Really? At least put it on the side if you're not going to add it to the salad before serving it. I can only assume that perhaps something was going on in the kitchen that led to the slow service or maybe our server was just new. Either way, I know we weren't the only ones being affected. I spent so much of my meal time sitting and waiting that I observed other tables around me getting apologies about the wait from their own servers, as well as a man who I can only assume was the manager on duty. For that, I didn't withhold leaving my server my normal 25% tip for our meal because I'm sure he was doing his best (or at least I hoped he was). But, this experience did leave me with a bad taste in my mouth and for that, I know I will not be returning here anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=380

Lina L.,"Chula Vista, CA",2,97,3,5.0,6/12/2009,"The last time I went here was back in the beginning of March and I was very disappointed and wrote a bad review.  We went here today for lunch, it was myself, my husband and daughter.  My daughter chose the place to celebrate a good school year. Well, I don't know if we just chose to go on a good day or got a good waitress or if they just improved from all the bad reviews from when they first opened...but our experience this time was extremely good. We went around lunch time.  It was actually pretty packed inside.  We were seated immediately.  Greeted by our waitress within minutes.  Drinks given right away.  We ordered and food was out within maybe 15 minutes or so.  Not too long of  wait at all.  She even came to check on us several times.  During weekdays up until 2p I believe, they have a small lunch menu.  I didn't order off of it, I just decided to order what I usually order which was the pot roast, I kinda wish I just ordered something off the lunch menu for cheaper because the pot roast was SO full of fat and the gravy was salty, but I didn't complain.  My husband ordered off of the lunch menu though and got the half sandwich with salad.  The salad was pretty big for a side salad.  His sandwich, which you get to choose from 4 or 5, was a half sandwich, but pretty large.  He got the chicken club.  It was really tasty and it came with a side of fries.  His meal was only $6.95.  Thats really a good deal.  My daughter ordered her usual off the kids menu...chicken tenders with happy face potatoes, which she loves!  Plus her birthday is in 3 days, but I just told the waitress she was celebrating her bday too and she brought her a free pizookie, which is the reason my daughter even chose BJ's is because of the pizookie!  And there was candle on top, which made her feel even more special.  But as our waitress said when I asked if they sing too, ""she said, no and thank goodness we don't""  Haha.  I thought it was funny.  My daughter was fine with a free pizookie in which she chose chocolate chip.  If anyone goes to BJ's...you cannot leave without trying a pizookie! Our visit this time was definitely A LOT better than the last.  Service was great and speedy plus the food was great.  We are thinking of coming back for fathers day because we saw a sign that says all dads get a free BJ's pint glass and my husband liked it!

He didn't ask not one time if we were satisfied or wanted anything else. The other waiter dropping off our food did. He didn't give us the time of day and kept leaving even before we were done ordering. I never ever complain about service but it was so horrible I had to. He even was rude dropping off our check. I was more upset because my bf was home from military training and we chose to go to Bj's to have a disrespectful waiter. To top it all off after talking to the General manager who seemed very apologetic, he ended up giving is a courtesy card with NOTHING on there. So really I'm like done.

Regardless of the service I will continue to go... BUT first... In the numerous times I've been there the service has always been average or below it. If you want to order their awesome cream soda do so before 10am because they always seem to have ""ran-out."" around dinner time. But even if they do have the awesome cream soda available... it takes 20 minutes to get it. Once that's received you have to be really good at waving your hand or politely yelling ""Excuse me."" to get any waiter or waitress' attention. Then you can order... and wait another 40 minutes to get your food. Make sure you you bring some playing cards or have full cell phone battery to entertain yourself during the wait.  A bottled water or can of Coke is also necessary 'cause the waiter won't come by at all during the wait. Oh and God forbid you have to split the check... one of my waitresses said, ""Oh? Split check? Yeah.... we can.... well.... it takes 45 minutes to split it up."" Seriously, Terrible Waitress?! 45 minutes? Liar. Just stop being lazy. Recommend the Turkey Club, Spicy Tomato Spaghetti, Sante Fe Salad and the Tuscan Tomato Bisque soup. Note to BJ's staff: I will continue to go back because the food's good and it's one of the finer establishments in west Chula Vista... but that's no excuse to suck at service.

I always order the giant baked potato and they seem to be regular sized potatoes here. I mentioned it once and they said they would get me a new one, but then returned to let me know that they were out of potatoes and offered a dessert instead. Most recently I went there on a Monday evening when it was not crowded at all, but the service was definitely lacking. We had a party of 6 and 3 people ordered the 7 beer taster sampler and the waiter made some snide remark about making his job difficult. I asked if I could order the onion string appetizer that is no longer on the menu and he assured me I could. He came back a bit later and I put in my order for a potato in hopes of receiving a giant one that I could share with the hubby. The waiter hung out by the bathroom chatting with some other waiters never checking on us and finally they bring out two entrees. Where on earth is my gd appetizer?! So they bring out my not giant potato and the waiter then tells me it is taking a bit longer for the appetizer since it is not on the menu and it is a ""process"". Hey buddy thanks for letting me know it was going to take almost an hour to get my appetizer which I would have gladly canceled had you given me any sort of warning....

Granted most of it is beer (duh, it's a brewery) but it seems overloaded with unnecessary choices, or repeats of the same thing just packaged differently. Our server came to our table THREE times before I had actually finished reading through the whole thing and chose what I wanted for dinner. Some people may think that's a good thing, ""so much variety"" but for me, it was a waste of time. I'd prefer a simpler menu, with a few awesome items, than a zillion items packaged differently with different names. Anywho, all in all a nice place to eat, with friends, on a date, or with family.

There was maybe a total of 6 parties all together in the restaurant which isnt that many compared to the size of the place. We got our drinks rather quickly and the waitress took our order right away. Time goes by, too much time. 45 minutes later I ask one of the guys if he could check up on our food. Not one time did our waitress come to check up on us. Needless to say we all needed after 45 mins of conversing!! And just like magic, as soon as we asked him about our food, here comes the waitress with our food. I do not understand why it took so long to make our food with the restaurant being almost empty. My friend ordered a steak which didn't come out the way he wanted. Another friend ordered some pasta which she said tasted a little cold and her breadstick was stale as well. And to top it off, she found a hair in her pasta. Of course our waitress didn't know this because she never checked up on us untill the very end. Which is also when everyone finally got refills. The only good thing about the experince there is that she was able to split the bill according to how we wanted to pay and the bar we went to afterwards. And no, we didn't not leave a tip.

My husband was almost done with his dinner when mine finally came and it was COLD, not just tepid but super cold. I couldnt find the guy to ask him to warm it up so I ended up taking it home (ate the appetizer). So sad, I like the decor of this place and I'd like to give it another shot but i am seeing that the other reviews echo my complaints about service. I hope thier management reads this stuff and gets the place in gear. Until then, if you are in a hurry or getting dinner, go somewhere else, this place seems better for drinks although those took an eternity too... Lets hope it gets better. in this economy, people need to try harder.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=560
Cary M.,"Chula Vista, CA",3,51,,1.0,1/21/2010,"The prior reviews say it all..................EXTREMELY POOR SERVICE!! I thought I would give it another try after my last bad experience with poor service.  Even e-mailed management through their website and told them of the experience and they made it right and sent me a gift card to give them another try.  I did but I happened to use it in their Huntington Beach location.  Well things haven't changed much in the Chula Vista location.  It went downhill from the beginning when the waitress was taking our order she literally, without saying a word, walked to the next table to help them with something......came back to us like nothing had happened!  Service sucks bad here and the food is nothing to write home about.  Plus it is not like they are giving the crap away, it is way overpriced.  We will never return to this location.   Evidentally this place didn't get the memo on ""customer service""!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=560
Edward A.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,,2.0,11/12/2008,"Overall I had a great experience at the Bjs in East County. So i decided to give the Chula Vista Location a try. We were happily greeted by the hostess, sat at a table. Drink orders were taken and so on and so fourth.  About 20 minutes after we ordered the waitress told us they ran out of an item, but was unclear of item they ran out of. She informed us that the manager was going to talk to us and offer something else.  First of all you just opened how are you going to run out of something. Secondly why did it take 20 minutes before they informed the guest.  The manger was very blunt and offered random menu items to accommodate me. But nothing else sounded enticing. Dinner came. It was mediocre at best, I know it being Bj standards have to be set and i feel like it was not.  Pizookies are suppose to be their well known dessert. It is a freshly baked cookie with ice cream. So I would have to guess that they would have this technique down and set in stone. unfortunately my cookie was over cooked and hard, and the other Pizookies at my table were well baked. Soft, chewy and moist.  Overall service was decent. But the food is Horrible. Next time I go there I am just going to go for the drinks and hopefully then, they don't mess that up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=560
Vincent L.,"Chula Vista, CA",36,31,137,3.0,3/10/2010,Really nice place with great atmosphere. The only things I've tried there are the Pizza and beer. Both are great no major complaints.  Service was a little slow and trying to grab the waitress was a little bit of a hassle. A little on the pricey side but it's good quality deep dish pizza and beer. If you like Uno's you'll like this place. I actually think this place is better than Uno's,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=560
tammy n.,"Chula Vista, CA",95,58,,1.0,3/30/2009,"i ate at BJ'S in san jose so i figured we would go here for dinner... the wair took 5-10 minutes. seriosuly there were hella seats open.  we finally get seated. the server some white chick forgot her name.asks us for our drinks n see if we want appetizers helal rushing us. we just sat down forreals. anyways after we ordered waiting hella long cuz we got a pizza the bjs favorite. its alright. and i got the chardony(spelling?) shrimp pasta. THE PASTA WAS WATERY. NO SAUCE AT ALL. THE SHRIMP WASNT PLUMP LIKE THE MENU SAID. so i asked for more sauce on the side. fuck it must have been some special sauce cuz when i got it, it was a different color from my orginal pasta sauce. NASTY! im nto racists or anything but let me tell you our server SUCKED!!!!! so we sat next to a middleclass looking family with one daughter. (they were a white family so was our server) and damn our server gave them the best fucking service ever. she served them their pizza.like put that shit on a plate for them and everything. she didnt even give us out pizza some other dude did. ohh and when i wanted to take food home she just handed us boxes and dipped. but when the table next to us took food home. the server packed their shit for them. seriously i was annoyed. its probably she thought she wasnt gonna get a good tip from us!?( im asian and i was with 3 military guys)  whatever. i was annoyed. i didnt want to tip ther server but we still did. but forreals i felt like she didnt want to help the minorites. lols. im over it. i wont eat here again! OHHH and their beer sucks!!!!!! the BJ'S in san jose is way better!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=560
Jimmy G.,"Chula Vista, CA",4,20,,1.0,9/21/2009,"I've been to this place maybe 7 times total with 3 of them being at the Chula Vista location.  First of all, never had a problem with the La Mesa location other than the food was ok, nothing to really go back for.  I've been here three times once after I found out Uno's was closed and a couple with friends just because they really wanted to go.  First the food...it's just bland.  Had the deep dish pizza and it's nothing to write home about.  Uno's was a much better restaurant than this place just didn't have the beer or decor to back it up.  Second and worst of all, is the service.  Everytime I've been there I've either experienced lazy servers, messed up orders, long waits for food.  Also waitresses with attitude.  This isn't Dick's Last Resort.  The service is terrible.  I actually came to write this review after another friend mentioned the terrible service at this location.  I know management or whoever has to read the reviews here.  Do something about your staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=560
khristian c.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,3,,5.0,12/22/2008,I had never tried Bj's before and i was  suprised that i was able to go with my family. The employee that served us was so nice she gave us an idea on what is good on the menu and i gotta say try the barbecue beef sandwhich is the bomb! ans since we were newbies to the place they let us sample a drink for free at no extra charge!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=560
