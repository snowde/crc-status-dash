Mikey C.,"Tampa, FL",310,45,181,5.0,6/25/2016,"I've been here many times before. Mainly for pizookies (so heavenly). But tonight was different, my two friends and I came in tonight for a late bite. 1030pm on a kinda busy Friday night. Our server was phenomenal, and that doesn't seem like a fitting word. Shawn took great care of us. He was very attentive, fun to talk to and had a ton in common with us. We will definitely come back to see him. The calamari app was delicious. My ribeye (medium rare) was cooked to perfection as well as the asparagus. The tomato and mozzarella was probably the best I've had in my life. Fallen in complete love with the food and hospitality. Haven't had service this good... Ever. 5/5 stars every day of the week as long as Shawn is on the clock. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park?start=40
Jeffrey E.,"Tampa, FL",0,26,3,2.0,9/8/2017,"Our experience started with the server apologizing about a wait for our greet time. We waited about 8-10 minutes for a greet which isn't too bad as I've never eaten here before and I was definitely looking through the rather robust menu. Ordered a beer and vanilla cream soda that was drank all the way through the first 5 minutes of getting it. Mind you this was probably an hour experience. We ordered sliders w fries ,avocado egg rolls and Brussels sprouts.  Our server came back once through the entire menu to just drop off our check. No refill no nothing.  Food was very tasty, just the server was bad. She was definitely concentrating on the larger party in her section and we were ignored. Great food, terrible server. Seemed like she was weeded with the 6 tables in her section. No manager table touch... server was a young, red haired server... kudos to the chef, server just needs more training. Saturday 9/8 8:11pm section closest to the entrance.  The other couple next to us would ask for a refill, she would nod her head in acknowledgement and proceed to take order from 5 top with questions. Refill then became less of a priority and guest experience suffer. Next!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park?start=40
Amanda Y.,"University, Minneapolis, MN",2,10,3,5.0,1/10/2017,Great restaurant with great house made beers! Happy hour is wonderful (half off apps and alcohol specials) and their dessert cookies are to die for.

Angelina F.,"South Tampa, Tampa Bay, FL",442,54,189,4.0,5/23/2016,Our family really enjoys this restaurant. There is something for everyone. I really appreciate the enlightened meals that give you the calorie count. The only reason I'm not giving them five stars is because they took away two of my favorite item. The Thai mango chicken salad and the bruschetta appetizer. Other than that it's a wonderful place with a great atmosphere and friendly staff.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park?start=40
Gary F.,"Tampa, FL",82,65,126,4.0,1/15/2017,"This was my first time here. The menu was pretty large, they have something for everyone that's for sure. Everything was decent, nothing extraordinary. Service was fine. I had the deluxe burger that has guacamole on it. It was served with steak fries, more than an adequate portion - I only ate half. Everyone at my table seemed to enjoy their food. Pretty good spot for a mall restaurant. If I was at countryside mall again I might give it another shot!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park?start=40

Diana A.,"Tampa, FL",319,175,112,2.0,10/6/2015,"Can't believe I have to lower stars on this place. Was one of my favorite places. Last time I went service was not great. This time was not good AGAIN. Both times took over 5 min to even get a greet from a server. I was a server for a long time, if it took more than 45 seconds to greet a table it was unacceptable. If you're busy at least say hello to the table. Iv  never seen this at any other restaurant happening  twice. Server was forgetful. Hoping it was a one time thing but guess not . I always get the crusted chicken, was bland and And over cooked wasn't impressed.  They took away their nachos. Which is sad because they used to be so oooey goey good until they started skimping on the cheese. It's like a metaphor for this place.... Was delish then got lazy.  Hate to give this place this review but needs to be improved.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park?start=40

C-Mac W.,"Tampa, FL",40,57,16,5.0,6/4/2016,Highly recommend sitting at the bar. Best seat in the house! Why? Because Billie is by far one of the best bartenders I have ever encountered. And we eat out and travel a lot!  Billie delivers amazing customer service and makes everyone feel special. She has an amazing memory and is always on her game. BJs is lucky to have her in the team.

Kristy S.,"Winter Park, FL",83,101,141,2.0,9/18/2015,"We stopped by only to get dessert.  We'd never been  to any BJ's before and we came because my brother-in-law had points to redeem for a pizookie (pizza and cookie).  The hostess took us to our seats and the server promptly got us our drinks.  Unfortunately, my husband order a Red Buffalo that didn't have its layers. The server said she asked the bartender and he said it was because it was coming out of the tap thinner than usual.  When the pizookie came out, it looked nothing like the picture, which was disappointing. We got it half Salted Caramel and half PB&J. When we scooped into it,  it was so good. What we'd wanted after just having lunch at a different establishment. We might try BJ's again. Not sure if it will be the same location since we're from outta town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park?start=40
Swathi O.,"Tampa, FL",4,12,20,5.0,6/21/2016,"I gave it a 5 Star for only two reasons.  Love the vegetarian Toppings on the Tavern cut as I m not at all a fan of Deep dish pizza.  Ask for -vegetarian toppings on Tavern Cut pizza and I m sure you won't regret, preferable to ask for additional toppings such as Jalapeños and Fiery Roast Bell Pepper which will blow your mind and give you a Lip Smacking experience :)  Second reason is ofcourse the Dessert!!! Haaaa.. Love the Cookies and cream Pizookie, but all the others are also amazing!  Also get the BJ's Rewards card.  I m sure you'll want to go back! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park?start=40
Jody B.,"Port Richey, FL",11,5,2,2.0,2/5/2017,"Not a fan. Staff was nice but the restaurant was dirty. We went in on a Sunday afternoon, it was not busy. Waiter sat us at a table with black ants crawling all over it. Not just a few, but a lot. So we moved ourselves and let our waitress know when she came to take our order. She apologized and said she would let the manager know. The whole time we were there nobody came to take care of the ant issue. Also, I'm glad I ordered finger food because my silverware had food on it when I unrolled it from the napkin. Overall experience not good, overpriced for basically chain food. Will not be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park?start=40
Stephanie M.,"Lutz, FL",0,11,10,5.0,8/7/2016,"We have never been to BJ's before and OH my goodness! SO happy we tried something different.  I got the portabella mushroom and asparagus starter salad which was fantastic. Goat cheese, cranberries and balsamic dressing and baby greens.  But even better - honey siracha Brussels sprouts. I am in my happy place. Many people don't like brussel sprouts, but try these. They are just awesome.  And their beer is great too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park?start=40
Jasmine P.,"Tampa, FL",9,97,97,3.0,6/6/2016,"Food was ok, nothing out off the extraordinary, they can use a little more flavoring. Service was good and very convenient location since they are located inside the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park?start=40
Sandy C.,"Webster, TX",146,63,190,5.0,9/22/2015,"Went here with the whole family on a football Sunday. The service was fast and food was great! Ambience was very fun and family friendly as well. We ordered the Brussel sprouts and calamari for appetizers. This was the first time I've ever seen my family fight over vegetables. We highly recommend the Brussel sprouts.  For main entree I got the lemon thyme chicken and for low carb option, I replaced rice with broccoli. It had great flavor, but was a bit salty for my taste.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park?start=40
Cassie R.,"Las Vegas, NV",246,122,3,2.0,2/16/2016,"Overall, the food was okay.  However, I highly doubt I would go back and this is the reason why... My husband and I went there with our family, and My father in law is allergic to garlic. We put this told the waiter this upon seating. My father in law ordered a flat bread, that came with garlic and again reiterated about being allergic to garlic and inquired that it be made without it. No problem. The waiter noted it, told the staff and all our dinners were made. Well, we all get our food, and we all proceeded to eat. However, within a minute or two the waiter came over to see if we needed anything and glanced at my father in laws food and noticed there was garlic on it. At this point, he had already started eating it!!!! Luckily he had only taken a bite and spit it out, and didn't end up having a reaction, and the waiter was proactive.  However.... This could have been much much worse. be very careful if your allergic to anything when going here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park?start=40
Brian A.,"Tampa, FL",0,10,1,2.0,12/29/2016,"Go in to have a late lunch with family on Sunday. Hostess looses our name and seats everyone but us. She's says ""it was crazy for awhile"". Host runs over one of my sons on our way to the restroom. Restroom is flooded and very dirty, we both almost slip and fall. Finally get sat and 10 minutes to be greeted by server. We had to get our own silverware when entrees are delivered, never got the appetizer we ordered. Food was mediocre at best. Asked the manager what was going on, she checks the table once and offers a single dessert. She hides when she sees that we are leaving. First and last time eating at this so called restaurant!!!

Keith R.,"Tampa, FL",18,16,180,1.0,5/2/2015,"Let's start by saying this was not necessarily the worst experience I've had, but it was disappointing enough that I will never go back.  Waiter - He seemed like a newbie. He didn't make or break our experience.  Drinks - Beer was good (Pirhana?), Margarita tasted like a Jose Cuervo bottled mix - no bueno.  Food - Our appetizer was the Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps. Too much of the wrong flavors - just didn't work. I ordered the New Orleans Jambalaya. Sausage was overcooked, chicken was chewy, rice was soggy. Fiancée ordered the Shrimp Scampi. It was okay if you like jarred garlic, twice frozen shrimp, and too much pasta on your plate.  Service/Cleanliness - Noticed residue on the silverware immediately upon sitting down. My fiancée got a glass of water after her margarita and it had once-powdered, crusted dishwasher residue chunks on the glass. All. Over. The. Glass. Appetizer was brought out with the entree with no rhyme or reason. Service was very slow. No sense of urgency whatsoever.  Altogether I probably could have had a better dining experience at TGIFridays - and let's just face it, that's sad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park?start=40
Angela M.,"Sarasota, FL",0,23,5,1.0,6/15/2017,"Ok I just wanted to write another reveiew. The general manager happened to read my last review and was so kind to send me a gift card for the troubles we had. We went back tonight, but decided to go to a differnt, closer restaurant. Here is my full experience since this time I actually got to try the food. We started off with an appetizer of potatoe skins, which I must say are EXCELLENT. My fiance ordered a burger and fries with a side of cole slaw. Mind you that we did have to pay extra for the cole slaw ($3.95). I ordered a rack of ribs with a loaded baked potato and asparagus. ALL of the food was EXCELLENT! I mean it was darn good! But then, we were low on drinks. The server came by and asked if we needed refills, we said yes. A long time went by and we had to stop him and ask if we could get a refill. My fiance tasted the cole slaw and it was spicy, which was weird, so we asked the waiter if thats just their cole slaw, which he informed us they have 2 different types, a spicy one and one that is more of a classic cole slaw. He asked the waiter if we could trade the cole slaw, because we didn't know they had 2 kinds, and the waiter said yes. He came back a couple minutes later and set the new cole slaw down and walked away rather quickly. We looked and it was less than half of what we should have recieved. When we saw the waiter again he said ""oh they have to make more so i just gave you what was left"" and walked off like that is ok. What he should have done was said ""Hey, I'm sorry guys they didnt have quite enough would you like to wait and i can bring you out a little more"" that would have been perfectly exceptable. Oh! but it gets better folks! We asked for a manger, the manager comes and we told him everything. I don't typically make a big deal of things like this but $3.95 is a bit much for a small bowl of anything and to not get a full bowl kind of well pardon my language, sucks. So the manger kind of blew us off and acted like his server was justified for bringing us less than half a serving. My fiance asked if it would be acceptable for bringing someone a half a pizza, which the manager actually said ""well.....i dont think so"" OF COURSE NOT! It is so sad that the food at BJ's is AMAZING and I would LOVE to frequent the restaurant, but with the service the way it is, and at more than one location, I will not be back. What this place needs to do is clean house as far as their servers go, or a training camp. It is almost like they are afraid to come out and tell their guests ""hey we dont have what you want, would you like something else, or like to wait while we make it"" Customer service is not that hard to do, and this place could be a lot better with the proper training.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park?start=40

Ameesh P.,"Tampa, FL",295,594,270,3.0,11/23/2014,"I've been to this location a couple of times and each time walk away with an average view.  On my most recent visit I decided to take my parents and nieces out for meal and given there were 2 children, their palates dictated the type of cuisine we chose and hence we ended up here.  The wait was pretty fast and we were seated at a very large booth.  The one thing I did like is that there are flat screen TV's everywhere and given that it was college football Saturday, it was great to be able to see a couple games and catch the highlights during the 2 hours we spent here. That sums up my experience.  A very regular meal ended up being a 2 hour affair.  The drink orders went in rather quickly and we had a server who advised she was in training so at first it was almost great having 2 people watching over our table as there was a mentor type person with her.  Once we placed our orders, however, we had a new server who must have been overloaded as he was pretty scarce after taking our orders.  I was also left without a beverage and never got  refill during the entire meal.   As far as food goes, we had a few sharers at our table who split a pizza that looked pretty good.  I had the jambalaya, which was overall pretty decent for a chain restaurant.  We did indulge in a pizookie, which is their version of a chocolate chip cookie made in a small pizza pan topped with ice cream.  That was probably the highlight of the entire experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park?start=60
Cat G.,"Greater Northdale, FL",25,183,127,2.0,12/19/2015,"Sadly, I have to lower my rating for my once favorite restaurant. Service has really gotten terrible. I have been there twice in last month and both times were borderline painful. The first time, about a month ago, there were 3 of us and the server couldn't even put our drink orders in; we sat for over 10 minutes until my friend went up to the bar to get our drinks.  The most recent visit (yesterday), I was there for our work holiday lunch so there were 12 of us. They gave us ONE server who got switched out halfway through. The server only took half of our orders and then we had to flag down a different server to get our server to take the rest. Our meals all came out at different times. Totally unacceptable.  I do not see myself returning here again. Truly disappointing that a once great restaurant has fallen so far.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park?start=60
Wayde P.,"Tampa, FL",53,60,79,5.0,9/5/2016,"It's been a few years since the last time i ate at BJ's. I had the pleasure of eating there for the 3rd time last night with my family. My most recent experience was without a doubt the best i've had at the restaurant. My party was seated promptly, the food was excellent and the service was fantastic.....BJ's menu is expansive... Almost overwhelming, but you can't be mad at choice. The varities of beer seemed endless (i tried the Nutty Brewnette). I enjoyed it. My wife and i ordered Chips and guac for an appetizer (amazing).... And i ordered their new Triple Decker deli sandwich (didn't regret that decision one bit).....As stated before, the service was great. Our server was very polite and perfectly attentive. My 2 yr old son threw his menu on the ground twice and other servers who passed by didnt hesitate to pick it up (they were very nice about it too). Wonderful experience overall at BJ's.

And to make it better after my second time of being transferred, I had my order taken, was told to wait 30 mins before picking up...I show up 45 mins later, go to the takeout counter and am told that I never ordered (until I showed that I had clearly called, and had her verify that it was their correct phone number). She then asked who I spoke to as she was the only one taking orders for the to-go counter (Well DUH...who do you think took my order and forgot about it?).

Page H.,"Tampa, FL",39,76,103,4.0,7/23/2016,My girls and I love to go to BJ's! They have a wide variety of foods to chose from so even the picky eaters in my family can find something they like. The main thing I love about this place is they have so many really good deals. Ex- 1/2 price large pizza on Mondays. You can sign up to be a BJ's member and get deals emailed to you. ( I know what you are thinking..like I need one more thing to sign up for) but it is totally worth it! Today I got an amazing black and blue bacon burger and a free pizookie.

Riley L.,"Tampa, FL",0,408,585,4.0,6/29/2015,"Ordinarily I'd prefer to have a root canal than go to a mall. And I never figured I'd ever want to go to the mall just to eat...but this place isn't the horror show I usually expect. First of all, they have an extensive list of imported and craft beers and also a selection of preivate label draft brews of all different types. I don't believe they actually brew it themselves as they imply but wherever it's made, it is pretty good. I always order their ""Pirhana"" brew which is a hoppy drink like an IPA. The food is nothing very special but they do a real nice mini pizza. Ive had a few of them ranging from buffalo chicken too cheeseburger pie.  The other nice thing is that when my wife wants to go shopping she can just drop me off at BJ's and I can sit at the bar while she shops and when she finally comes back with all her packages we can relax in a comfortably booth and have dinner. She calls it the ""Husband Daycare Center"" where you can drop off your mate and they will care for him while you shop.

Patrick C.,"Valrico, FL",0,9,,2.0,1/23/2016,"I usually like going to BJs due to their beer and pizookies. Normally I enjoys my visits the BJs in Pinellas Park or Countryside. However, this trip to the citrus park one is one of the worst experience with the franchise.  To begin with, the service that my group received was very sub par. For a group of 8, we were placed in a 2 sided booth that was very cramped and impractical. Eating properly was difficult let alone going to the bathroom. Secondly, our drinks came out very slowly. While I can understand this for cocktails, beers should not take that long at all. Lastly, our server did not get our dessert order correctly and did not stop by our table to check up until well after to deliver the check.  For a chain restaurant where food is not much better from it's contemporaries, service is what sets restaurants apart. BJs at Citrus park failed at this for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park?start=60
Kelleigh M.,"Tampa, FL",119,909,712,4.0,1/7/2013,"I've always been a fan of Bj's menu, especially their salads.  My go to has always been the BBQ chicken salad.  This one is different than most...they put tiny bits of jicama in it.  I'm not 100% sure what jicama is except that its a type of root vegetable.  It gives it a nice crisp texture-I love it. My latest trip to BJ's was for take out and I utilized their curb side Togo which was nice. There are 2 spots by the front that are available for curbside. Since my New Years resolution is to eat healthier when available, I decided to skip my go to (it has ranch dressing and crispy union straws) and I tried a salad off their new ""enlightened"" menu-basically everything is less than 575 calories.  I ordered the thai mango salad.

Second, no refills the entire time on drinks and when I ordered a medium rare Cheeseburger I got a burger that was burnt to hell.  Third, I asked for a side of chipotle aioli when my food was delivered  (which I asked for when ordering) and the woman rolled her eyes at me and had zero customer service when delivering it.

This place is primarily known in my area for their big menu pizookie's and crispy fries! The menu consists of 25 Pages of food to choose from. I don't know how it's financially possible to have a 25-page menu with those entree's, appetizers and such, but it somehow worked for them. The food came out at least 10 minutes after it was made, which was utterly impressive. The pizookie was like a baked cookie in a pan with lots of ice cream stacked on top. I ate it so swiftly, it took about two minutes for me to finish. However the speed of service was slightly tedious as I was barely finished with my appetizer as soon as the entree came. And the metal taste that came from the pan for the cookie ruined the taste of the cookie by a little bit.  Overall, the speed of the service, and the food was really great. -- I just hope they would slow down before the distribute the food to customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park
Mudd M.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",0,9,15,3.0,12/13/2017,"We were a table of 6 on Monday evening, 12/11 at 7pm.  We were seated immediately and our server was Amanda S.  She greeted us quickly, got our drinks, and returned to take our order as expected.  We had separate checks and it wasn't a problem at all.  Our food arrived in an acceptable amount of time and it had the quality you'd expect from BJ's.  It's always good. Our food was delivered by 3 food runners that, guess what, auctioned off our food!!!  Which of course created some confusion because 2 people weren't exactly sure what they ordered.  So the runners tried harder to auction off the food.  Seriously?  I'm baffled a restaurant of this caliber still auctions off food.  Is this what BJ's expects?  It's disheartening.  We completed our meal, Amanda refilled our drinks as expected, but she left our dirty plates sitting in front of us until she picked up our checks.  She checked on us 3 times after we finished and she left empty handed each time.  When she dropped off our 6 separate checks, of which she didn't auction off and knew exactly where they went, she again left empty handed.  We still had 6 dirty plates we had now pushed towards the center of the table.  When she returned to pick up the checks she took 3 plates with her.  Finally.  But we were done so it was for naught. I suggest you work on not auctioning food and pre-bussing tables.  Had she done this I'd give 4.5 stars.  I'll be back but I'll either sit at the bar or be vocal to the server and request they take the dirty dishes.  I'll probably be upset with more food auctioning so I'll meet the manager that night as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park

They have speciality drinks-cream soda! That was ok so good and free refills which is always a plus because that can add up!  Our meal was amazing. The salmon was cooked perfect crisp but not over cooked. The chicken thyme was great. The food was healthy and just enough where you feel full but not stuffed where you fill sick.  Because it was our first time there we could download the BJs app! We got a free dessert for doing this! A pookalooza (forget what it's called lol) but it was an amazing dessert and it was free.

Julie F.,"Pompano Beach, FL",1606,475,1689,3.0,11/22/2016,"This is 3 to 4 stars. Depending on what you ordered. This place was packed on a Tuesday night. And freezing inside. It was so noisy it was hard to hear (we were a party of 6 people at a long table.) They have call ahead seating which you may want to take advantage of if you are a larger group... The menu is like a bible -- barely got through half of it. A little daunting... The kids had several choices of meals. Seemed to like their pizza and spaghetti. One couple shared their special dinner for two for $25. Each had a soup (said the broccoli cheese was outstanding and the chili very good); then shared a pizza; and the pizzoli (pictured dessert). The pizza was a flat bread which they adjusted toppings to taste. The s'mores (sorry :0 spell check keep changing that to snores...) was warm toasted real melted marshmallows on top of peanut butter and chocolate. It was gooey and rich and sweet -- a real sugar rush -- that definitely should be shared. It would overwhelm one person.  I had a tomato soup that was quite good -- a rich bisque that had the taste and texture of real tomatoes. It was served very hot as asked. The first part of my ""soup and salad"" was a wedge salad. A nice chunk of iceberg covered with bacon bits on top of blue cheese dressing. The standard wedge not outstanding but quite satisfying. No surprises here but would order it again. Hey, what can I say I like iceberg... So overall it's a good place to go when you're not sure what you want to eat -- potstickers to sliders to pizza to... and good for a group cause everyone can get something different.

Randy G.,"Lutz, FL",4,285,366,4.0,1/26/2015,"Wife and I have been hmming and hawing about trying out this restaurant for quite some time now. Most places that have a huge menu selection usually only make avergae meals at best. BJ's is the exception instead of the norm. We started off with a pepperoni pizza dip and it was amazing. a plethora of cheeses and Marinara suace topped with small cubes of pepperoni and serves with small thin slices of garlic toast. The wife had parmesan crusted chicken that was so thin,tender, and definately crusty cheesy. I had the lasagna that was actually oversized raviolis filled with numerous cheeses and covered in a sauce and mozzarella cheese. Delicious. Now even after all of these great treats the dessert was the pinnacle of the meal. Salted caramel Pizzookie. Now a pizzookie is a 6' round deep dish pizza pan that they add cookie dough to the bottom of the pan then run it through the pizza oven, once on the other side, vanilla ice cream is added then toffee pieces, then caramel and chocolate sauce is drizzled over a shot of whipped cream. A perfect end to the meal. I washed all this down with thier made in house root beer that had hints of sasparilla and birch. Very refreshing and a great taste. Our Sever, James was very professional and very friendly, we will definately go back and ask for his table again. Now as for the atmosphere, its a sports bar environment so expect high levels of noise. The hard floors and shape of the dining area promote echoing and amplification of conversations but if you are a foodie, then the food always takes priority.

Luis C.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,3,,3.0,1/10/2016,"I'll admit I didn't know what to expect from this place. Just having moved from the West Coast, my wife and I have been actively seeking out what Tampa has to offer in terms of casual hangouts with decent food & drink. The menu is eclectic & fairly health-conscious, and that plus NFL happy hour got us through the door. Unfortunately, our first impression wasn't so hot. We arrive, there's a wait. Totally understandable with it being a Saturday night. So we saunter on over to the bar thinking ""ok let's grab a few drinks while we wait, no biggie."" I sit myself down, make eye contact with the bartender, and I wait. And I wait. And I wait. And it really seemed like he did everything he could to help every single person around instead of me. Including several who arrived after me. I don't know if it was my face, what I was wearing, or if I reminded him of someone he hated in high school. But it was borderline hilarious; even the random people around me were making comments about how long it was taking. Literally 10 minutes I stood there being totally obvious about the fact I just wanted to buy a drink, and it's not as if the bar was overly busy. I'm not going to be rude to a bartender and start blurting things out or waving my hands around at them after we've already made eye contact a few times. Because of my profession - for better or worse - I've been in hundreds of bars & the cues are obvious. So finally, after about (no exaggeration) the 6th time he walked past to help someone that had arrived after me I blurted out ""you going to help me or what?"". He sighed really big, said ""what do you want man"", and I thought ""you know what, I don't really want a drink from you"" and walked away. It was just a weird interaction and borderline hostile. So after that awkwardness our party actually had a GREAT time. The food was pretty tasty for a chain type place, lots of good options. Calamari was yum, and the Jambalaya was decently spicy & flavored. Drinks were super cheap/strong, our service was attentive and perfect. Dessert was a 3-way pizzouki thing that got devoured in about 7 seconds flat. Even after being presented with a last-minute check split our server settled us up to a T. All the rest of the employees seemed super nice & everything seemed clean & well-presented. No complaints. I don't know if I'll be back, mainly because I don't want to see weirdo bartender again, but I can recommend this place to anyone that wants a fun, affordable night out with friends in a casual environment.

BJ's is located inside Citrus Park Mall, right near the front entrance and opposite Red Robin (Yummmm!). We had some client reports to finish, otherwise we would have likely enjoyed a sampler of their craft beer. Instead I went with an iced tea, but made a note to come back next time for a beer. The menu is loaded with the standard mall pub grub, but I did see some nice lower calorie selections, and a lot of soup & salad options. There's the usual flatbreads, pizzas, salads, soups, appetizers, sammies, burgers, wraps, and so on. I had the lunch-portion teriyaki shrimp stir fry over rice and it was quite good, and only 245 calories. The stir fry was made with grilled shrimp, sautéed with onions, red peppers, cabbage, green onions and baby carrots tossed with teriyaki sauce and served over sticky white rice topped with sesame seeds.

I went after a Yankees spring training game around 10pm on a Thursday night, not many choices at this time so my girlfriend suggested bjs (mind out of the gutter please lol) I got one of the new tavern pizzas,  and asked for the beer on the advertisement card. Luckily my waiter knew his beers and warned me about the strong flavor that one had and asked if I was into that kind of beer. I had no idea and just wanted to try something new. He brought a few samples and let me say, that probably saved the meal. Wish I knew his name to post here, but awesome guy!

Lauren C.,"Dunedin, FL",124,741,216,3.0,3/15/2015,"This was my first visit to the citrus park BJs location. The experience had a few ups and a few downs so I'll settle at an average of 3 overall. I called in to reserve a table when I was on my way as I figured they'd be busy on a Friday night at 7 pm. But when we arrived there was only a 5 minute wait since we called ahead. Our server greeted us right away and provided excellent service throughout the whole meal. For drinks, I started off with the orange twist mocktail.  I really like that they have a nice section of alcohol free drinks (4 different mocktail flavors in total) in addition to their full bar and impressive beer choices. My friend and I took our sweet time deciding what to get as we were chatting a bit and the menu is quite extensive, which doesn't make for an easy decision. Since I couldn't decide on ""just"" one thing I opted for the tomato and mozzarella small salad to start followed by the corn fritters and gourmet mac n cheese. The salad was 2 thumbs up, fresh, excellent flavor and nice presentation. The mac and the corn fritters came out next. I've had the mac before but it seems as if they've changed it now. It was decent overall but nothing out of this world or ""gourmet"". The description of the corn fritters on the menu ""served with jalapeño, bacon bits and spicy aioli sauce"" makes it sound better than it actually was. They were overly fried and not all that flavorful. The guilt of eating a fried starch was not worth it In this case. Finished off the evening with a mini white chocolate macadamia pzookie.  OMG. Perhaps I'm the only one who had never experienced that deliciousness before, but wow was It good! And the mini was just the right size.

Jessica M.,"Tampa, FL",34,19,20,3.0,4/4/2014,"I'll say this first: I'm a beer snob. BJ's beers are just plain not very good. They're one step above your mass produced varieties, but nowhere near as good as a true craft brewery. BUT, they typically have at least one or two good guest taps.  On this particular day, the bartender, nor another employee, could tell me what the 7venth Sun beer was on tap. Just 'it's an IPA'. OK. The brewery makes lots of varieties of those. And they seemed non-plussed that they didn't know. You are a beer bar. If you're going to have guest taps, maybe your bartenders should know what they are. Then my receipt had a completely different beer on it. Maybe I shouldn't have expected more at a chain restaurant/brewhouse in a mall. They have great food. That's why I gave three stars, else it would be less. Their beers are mediocre at best (IMHO), and I guess they can't even be bothered to care what else they're serving on draft. Again...

The beers have very cheesy and corny names which didn't make me feel like trying anything, but it was lunch on a weekday, so I really couldn't anyway.  After reading the Cheesecake Factory sized menu, I decided on one of my goto's which is Chicken Parm. I ordered the lunch special which was $12 I think and it comes with a soup or salad. I chose the chicken tortilla soup and was surprised to get a whole bowl of it. I also ordered thai chicken wontons because they were only $3. Those were also delicious like the soup. The entree was big for a lunch special and the chicken parm was crispy and juicy. The marinara was spicy and the spaghetti was cooked perfectly.

Thea H.,"Tampa, FL",27,91,3,4.0,9/15/2013,"There are very few places that I would want to be a regular. This is my place. My fiance and I started going to the one in Pinellas Park when we were first going out and I took him there for his birthday. When we moved in together, we started going to this location all the time. We just love this place. The service at this location is hit or miss but only once has it been terrible. The atmosphere is sports and beer with fully clothed male and female waitstaff. In other words, you can take the kids here and have a cold one. The huge screens are for ESPN, ESPN Classic, ESPN 8 ""the ocho"", etc... Beer is also a highlight of this place. It's a ""brewhouse"" after all. The drink menu is extensive but so far I have fallen in love with the Berry Burst Cider and the Double Berry. My fiance enjoys the Black Velvet most of the time. We have tried a few other drinks but those seem to be what we like the best. After so many visits, it's hard to be objective about the food because I've had so many things on the menu. Appetizers we enjoy are the calamari, crispy wantons (buffalo and thai), and the potato skins. The potato skins are double fried so they aren't my favorite. Hands down my favorite entree is the jambalaya. Finally it's a dish with sausage I can eat! It's so perfect with the spices they use. It is a hot dish so if you hate spicy, this is not for you. Another great dish is the balsamic glazed chicken. There have been times the chicken was too dry but when the chicken is just right, it's perfect. I also love the crispy onion strings. So tasty! Desserts are the best here. You can't go wrong with a pizzoki but a real hidden gem is the baked beignet. It's perfection- crisp beignet with ice cream, strawberry syrup, and whipped cream. It's so light and delicious you'll want more than one. It's a great place and it's highly recommended.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park?start=120

We sat at the bar and the bartender was very friendly.  Mom got a pinot grigio and I got the house brewed hefeweizen draft.  It was really good-but $5.25 for a beer always chaps my @$$...guess that's pretty standard. For lunch, mom ordered the veggie burger (would never eat that so I didn't taste it) and I ordered the Caesar salad with the shrimp tacos. I will dream about those shrimp tacos! There are 2, they are stuffed full but not so full you get all messy.  Comes with chips, salsa and 'avocado cream' on the side which is basically a less thick version of guacamole.  Very delicious and not too filling so you don't feel like a cow trying on clothes afterwards. Will definitely go back again for a draft and those shrimp tacos!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park?start=120

Alright, maybe I am but I have come here a few times over the last year and it is not bad.

Service was good.  Fried calamari was cooked nicely and still very tender.  Avocado rolls came with their own ""stones"" or pieces of inedible pit.  Yikes.  Not so good.  The California burger sounded great on the menu: toasted sourdough bread, avocado, roasted green chilies, pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayonnaise and ranch dressing.  Sure it will blow out an artery if you're not careful, but man it was delicious in my imagination. On the plate - not so strong.  Something was missing.  I tried adding a slice of tomato, but still no dice.  Mediterranean pizza was a big hit and the potstickers seemed to be a happy choice along with the Caprese salad.   The bazooki was crazy, warm baked cookie topped with ice cream.

Had to wait some time for our server who seemed to not know what she was doing or was intoxicated on some substance. After finishing and waiting for our check for 15-20 mins we ended up getting and paying for someone else's check. After waiting all that time I simply gave the waitress my card and didn't look over the check. My wife however did notice it once the waitress returned and let her know. She apologized and went to correct it and bring the proper check. We asked if she had voided the first transaction from our card and she claimed she had. So we paid again and left FINALLY. After checking my CC statement I noticed we had been charged for both checks. I called and spoke with the manager on the phone who apologized and said to bring in the statement and she would take care of it. So on my own time I returned and was greeted by a very unfriendly wench of a manager whos name now escapes me. She acted like she was doing me a favor and took forever to correct the matter.

Holly H.,"Melissa, TX",9,81,2,4.0,3/5/2010,"I think this is a very nice restaurant and brewery.  They have a great 7 beer taster set for about $10. You get pretty large ""samples"" of their seven main beers. It's a great way to discover what you like, and since they aren't tiny little tasters, you can let multiple people try them out to see who likes what before ordering themselves a beer.  Their chips and salsa are yummy. The salsa is just spicy enough without going overboard, and the tri colored chips really entertain the little kids that I've gone there with.  I've had a few different entrees there, and all were yummy. I usually can't eat the entire place of food because there's simply too much.  The Parmesan encrusted chicken is delicious, especially with the cheesy mashed potatoes that come with it.  The Hamburger sliders are yummy and make for a good lunch.  The menu is large, and everything always sounds so good. I'd say the only problem with BJ's is that you have to choose one thing to eat...and it's difficult.  The desserts are amazing! They have these things called Pazooki's (I think that's how it's spelled) they are 5-6 inch cookies in a little pan with two scoops of ice cream on top. They have 4 different cookies I believe (choc. chip, macadamia nut, Oatmeal raisin, and choc. choc chip I think) They also have an oreo version. They donate part of the proceeds to a children's foundation as well. I've had the oatmeal cookie one which was very good, but I'm more in love with the brownie! They also have BJ's Brownie...it's a gooey brownie in a pan with three scoops of ice cream, whipped topping, chocolate sauce, and cherries on top. Delicious!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park?start=160
Benjamin M.,"Denver, CO",208,199,139,2.0,3/12/2010,"I ate at BJ's on a Tuesday night around 9pm and the restaurant was nearly empty. I guess this location is kinda out of the way. I've lived in Tampa for nearly four years, and this was my first time to Citrus Park Mall. I think BJ's would be much more popular if it was at International Plaza or even the Westfield in Brandon.  A colleague recommended the pizzas, so I ordered the buffalo chicken pizza. When our server brought my pizza, I could almost hear my arteries moaning. The buffalo chicken pizza may be one of the most unhealthy foods on the menu--but WOW it was good!  BJ's is famous for their beer and their pizookies. I don't drink, but I did try a pizookie--an amazing dessert involving a giant chewy cookie topped with exorbitant amounts of ice cream topped with chocolates and sugary syrups. This is a fantastic way to follow an ultra unhealthy meal, right? This place can make Five Guys look like Subway. The bottom line: if you want to get drunk and pump yourself full of trans fats, then BJ's should be #1 on your list.

(although nothing beats their deep dish!) My wife and I decided to eat at BJ's at Citrus Park Mall for lunch. We were greeted at the door with a friendly welcome and smile. We were promptly seated by the hostess, and shortly thereafter Maria introduced herself as our server, again with a friendly smile, and took our drink order, which arrived very quickly. We mentioned to her that this was our first time eating here, so she took the time to explain the different menu options, and with the many questions we had, she was VERY patient with us. She gave us plenty of time time to review the menu, and checked with us occasionally to see if we were ready to order or had any questions. Not once did we feel rushed, or forgotten about. We decided on the BJ's Favorite deep dish pizza. Our pizza arrived very quickly, less than 20 minutes, all the while our drinks were continually topped off. The pizza was thick, hot and tasty! If there was one down side to the pizza, it was a bit dry. There seemed to be a lack of tomato sauce, but the sweet crust and other flavorful toppings were great. Maria continued to top off our drinks and took away any trash/dirty plates and was very friendly. We could not have asked for a better server, props to her!!! The atmoshere was very good, clean and inviting. Several big flat screen TVs were placed throughout the establishment, all showing a different variety of sports, not to mention the huge 4 screen TV behind the bar. The restrooms were elegantly clean and tidy.  I look forward to my next visit so I can explore the other menu options, like the pizookie and their own home brew! We will ask for Maria to be our server next time as she was exceptionally wonderful and friendly, and hopefully BJ's will step it up on the tomato sauce!!

I did get a tad annoyed at having to wait over 5 min for a hostess to greet us, but the service the rest of the time was good so no biggie. We ordered two items off of the ""small bites"" menu to start with, which is essentially a small one-person appetizer. We choose the buffalo & blue cheese crispy wontons and the bruschetta, both were delicious. Upon ordering a sandwich for my meal, I was told how gigantic they are so we split a bbq pulled pork sandwich with fries. Honestly, the pork was dry and I wasnt impressed. It seemed like it was missing something besides the pork, onion strings, and a toasted bun. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing, but given the appetizers and good atmosphere I would come back. Bj's also has a huge menu of craft beer but I dont like beer enough to pay 6$ for a glass, so I cant give an opinion on that.

We had two waiters for our table one of the guys was supposed to be ""in training"" which we found out was not true. They took a very long time to get our order, they let our drinks get watered down and empty for 15-20 min before refilling them. They took over 30 min to get our food and they only served one or two of us at a time and took 10-15 minutes before they served two more people in our party. They were not busy at all so we did not understand why they were taking so long. Then the waiter ""in training"" spilled a drink on a guy in our party and did not tell the manager, (he tried to cover it up) he didn't seem apologetic at all. They also told my friend that she could not have her free birthday dinner that she had previously been told she could have if she signed up and got a BJ's card. once the manager was told, he apologized and gave everyone half off our meals and gave the birthday girl and the guy that had the drink spilled on him, free dinners. Everyone was happy, but then the waiter shorted EVERYONE on our change (the ones that paid cash for their dinners). I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE!

Vincent W.,"Tampa, FL",16,82,,2.0,3/18/2009,"The server was great and the place was nicely decorated and that's about the high point of my dinner at this place. My table ordered the spinach artichoke dip for appet., I've had much better.  The dip was kind of watery, can't really taste the spinach or artichoke, even though both were in the sauce.  For this dish, if the dip is bad it's pretty much downhill. I ordered salmon, with rice pilaf and steamed vegetables.  The entree also came with a side salad, I had the house with raspberry vinaigrette.   Side salad:  Flavor of the dressing wasn't really there.  It's raspberry, suppose to be a little sweet, I couldn't taste it.  It was mostly sour and water down.  The water down taste probably came from the lettuce itself.  It tasted like they just washed it and didn't dry it so lot of water was still in the salad. Salmon with rice pilaf and steamed vegetables: The salmon was grilled nicely but was very bland.  The ""steamed vegetables"" should've been called raw vegetables on the side.  It wasn't cooked all the way.  It had zucchini, cauliflower and broccoli.  All 3 were undercooked.  For the zucchini I wasn't able to eat the whole thing, only ate the middle and left rest because it was so hard.  Cauliflower and broccoli made me felt like I was eating a salad again.  The rice was probably the best thing on my plate. I also ordered iced tea.  I had it sweet first, but it was way too sweet, felt like I was drinking sugar water.  The server was very nice and switched it for me to unsweet, which wasn't much better but at least I wasn't going on a sugar high. I might come back here again after a long long long time, at least long enough for me to forget this time.  So enter at your own risk and good luck.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park?start=180

The bad: Went shopping Friday and decided to stay and have dinner instead of the usual couple of beers. After a couple of try's we found a seat at the bar, in front of the game we wanted to watch. Decided to try their $20 deal, like just every other chain is offering. The salad: Is not the baby greens as listed on the regular menu (is supposed to be the same in the promotional deal), the salad is just the bag type you buy at a discount warehouse, not good. BAD. The manager decides to change the televisions to a game that suited him better, without asking the people around the bar that were watching the games.  I don't know but most places ask before changing to get a compromise (not BJ's). I was a bit ticked off, went told that my game was still on, on the very opposite corner of the bar, I could watch it there. NOT. Asked for my stuff to be boxed to take home (did not finish the meal there). The cookie, that is part of the deal, is like raw dough and grainy sugar, not good, The bartender, could have been better, she did not take it well when I asked her to tell the manager that I did not appreciate him changing the game. To bad I had my stuff boxed and ready to go and had given her the tip already. I did tell the manager myself when I saw him by the podium in my way out. The good: The pizza was fantastic like always.

Mike W.,"Linden, NJ",119,247,644,4.0,2/14/2013,"Wow. What can I say? A restaurant that brings together great drinks, good atmosphere, and an impressive menu. Let me first say that this restaurant, at least on Friday and Saturday evenings, usually has a 30-45 minute wait, but they do offer call-ahead seating - take advantage of it! The first think you will be introduced to when you get seated (or approach the bar if you're waiting for a table) is the well thought out menu of beers crafted especially for this restaurant. There's a little of something for everyone- lighter beers, heavier beers- and even a seasonal beer fitting the appropriate time of year. The menu at BJ's has EVERYTHING. Literally. Pizza (wonderful), pasta dishes (excellent), chicken dishes (you gotta try the Parmesan crusted chicken), and more. Honestly, I have no idea how the kitchen keeps up with everything that folks order, but they do. I've been to this restaurant twice and have been very impressed with the skill our meals were prepared with. The only thing I'd like to see changed is the dessert menu - it's very heavy on baked good (ie. cookies) where I'd like to see some more creative items on the menu to match the rest of the offerings. There's gotta be a beer recipe or two that they could use. Overall, a very good choice for dinner, especially if you have a beer lover in the family. Just be sure to call ahead and put your name on the list in case they have a wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park?start=140

Excuse me?! I was under the impression that holding my food and consuming it would be a pretty solid indicator that I am in no way finished and needing to get out.

Haley D.,"Tampa, FL",273,94,7,3.0,2/7/2014,"We typically don't do sit down dinners with the kids, but we were wanting something other than our usual food court take-out, so we stopped for a quick bite on our way out of the mall.   The staff was extremely  helpful in seating us in a semi-private area so we would not bother patrons with our rambunctious child.   I was in the mood for a salad so I ordered the BBQ Chicken Salad.  This salad is jam packed with ingredients -which I love.  It makes me feel like I'm eating more than just a ""salad.""  The dressing was plentiful and the lettuce and vegetables were fresh and crisp.  The chicken was hot and diced into small bite size pieces.  Thanks to my husband holding our daughter, I was actually able to clear my plate (it's not easy juggling a child and eating a salad with lots of little pieces)   The staff is always friendly and very helpful and the ambiance is loud and fun like a Brewhouse should be.  This would definitely be a perfect place for a couple pals watching a game or catching up with the girlfriends.  I haven't tried the beer, but I've heard remarkable things about the samplers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park?start=140

The service here though can go both ways. They have amazing waiters, yet they also have not so nice ones. If you do have a problem with their staff, don't be afraid to ask for the manager. Their managers are very nice and will help in any way. BJ's has their own crafted beers. They also have a wide selection of their own drinks. I have had a few and haven't been disappointed in any. Their menu is huge, offering selections of pizzas, sandwiches, pastas, etc. The food is very yummy and cooked well. I haven't had a dish I didn't like. I highly recommend to save room for dessert. Their signature dessert is the pizookie. It''s a huge cookie that comes in a pie dish with ice cream and whipped cream. It is to die for! You can get different types of the cookie and most come with their homemade vanilla ice cream. I love it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park?start=140
Eric S.,"Murphy, NC",0,9,1,2.0,2/23/2013,"First I will state we are big fans of BJ's and have dined in many of their restaurants across the country....We were so happy when the one came to Citrus Park. One of the draws for us is the handcrafted beer, we especially like the Jeremiah Red. We stopped by Saturday around 4:30 for an appetizer and a beer after shopping. The restaurant was slow preparing for  the dinner crowd as there were a lot of servers standing around doing nothing. The beer and food was as usual and expected...what was disappointing for us was the service and cleanliness of the restaurant...It started when  I used the brass hand rail and my hand stuck to the rail, then we were seated at a booth that my wife hand to wipe the seat.....I put my elbows on the table (bad manners) and the table was so sticky they stuck....wait...then I open the menu and there is food smeared all over it....makes me really wonder what the kitchen looks like these days. There were two male managers working the floor and they obviously had some type of disagreement happening which created a stressful vibe in the place. It seems the current management is not up to BJ's standards as this is the worst we have seen it in years.

My wife said that her meal was OK.  I had to send mine back.  The dish was loaded with pepper.  Terriyaki is not a peppery dish.  I then ordered Chicken Marsala.  It was just passable.

Christie L.,"Vancouver, WA",7,36,,1.0,8/11/2013,"Let me first say that we have gone to this BJs for several years now. The beer is always good and the food has been OK. The quality of the food has gradually gone down hill until I finally had my first 'I can't eat this' experience. I love food and when I am really hungry (like I was today) I am not even that picky. I ordered their 'new' Bison burger cooked medium. The server said 'good choice'. Clearly this guy has never eaten this piece of crap. I love Bison burgers but I know the food here is never that great so I didn't even have super high expectations and like I said, I was starving!!! It comes out and here is the breakdown: (1) the burger is a tiny burger on a HUGE bun with a HUGE piece of lettuce, took me about 5 bites to even hit the crappy burger (2) 2 bites in to actual burger and I have to pull a sharp, hard piece of bone out of my mouth (3) the burger is an under-seasoned, greasy, and mushy piece of what had to be a previously frozen patty (4) I asked for it to be cooked medium but it was pretty much warm on the outside and raw mush on the inside I eat about 3 bites of actual burger and decide I can't continue. I don't think I have ever not eaten a meal at any other restaurant, it was that bad. The waiter asks if I want a to-go box and when I say 'No' he smiles like 'that good eh?' so I felt obligated to enlighten this idiot about the fact that this burger is so disgusting I can't eat any more of it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park?start=140

Dylan J.,"Carrollwood, Tampa Bay, FL",0,1,,1.0,7/26/2013,"I'm currently sitting at BJ's, and I have had the most bizarre, irritating, and somewhat offensive experience of my life.  When my wife, two children, and I arrived at Westfield, I noticed that BJs was crowded. So my wife decided that she and tke kids would go to walk through the mall, and I checked in and got a buzzer. We were told it would be about 15-20 minutes, so I put the buzzer at the bar, went to the restroom to wash my hands, came back to the seat at the bar, ordered a beer, and started watching the Rays. Altogether about a minute and a half.  Before the (very nice and attentive) bartender could deliver my Piranha Pale Ale, the buzzer went off. I was cool with the immediate seating, but somewhat peeved about the ""underpromise"" seating practice. Just tell me what's going to happen and fulfill those expectations, so I don't send my party somewhere else when you're prepared to seat us. Then, as I was standing at the hosting stand, trying to get a hold of my wife, things got shitty. One party came through (without ever holding a buzzer and with a wink from a server) and was seated right next to the bar. Ok, whatever, they know a server, and a lot of restaurants seat adults in areas like that before parties with kids.  Then, a second party, who had arrived later than we had (same total number and same number of children) was seated in the front area by the windows.  My family got back, and we were standing in the lobby, surrounded by other families. I clutched the beer close to my leg, trying to hide it. I'm more comfortable drinking a beer at the bar than in the waiting area; that's just a weird thing to do. After about five minutes, I asked the hostess what was up. Our table was ""being cleaned."" It took about thirty minutes for this table to be cleaned. When we finally were seated, it was at a table I can only assume is number terrible. The server station is actually attached to the booth, so as the servers retrieve silverware and other table settings, the drawers are slamming on our backs. Moreover, busy servers store discarded food on top of this station. It's literally so close that you could be enjoying your meal, have a hearty laugh or a stretch, and end up dropping your head on a plate of (canned, reheated, half-eaten) spaghetti. We're still waiting on our simple order of two kids chicken tenders, a jalapeño burger, and a corn fritter app. It's been an hour. I will never come back to BJs; we'll just go next door to the more appropriately priced Red Robin or the more foodie Giordano's instead. Or even Johnny Rocket's, at least they have a theme.  Both my wife and I are very busy professionally, we spend about $800 a month eating out. None of that will go to BJs anymore. You don't expect Bern's, but you don't expect blatant, unwarranted, and simply strange bad service either. If I could give 0 stars, I would.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park?start=140

She accepted the fault and then told us our meal was on them for the long wait we experienced. I felt like that was very classy of them to do.

I came here with friends for bday dinner but with all the great experience that I had at this place before they just went down. At first we decided to wait for one of our friend to arrive so we did not order yet. But when we figured that he is running late I decided to try there peach Margarita. And so the server checked my ID and did not even mention that it was my bday. no greeting or anything. at that point i got disappointed. if you are really checking DOB you should have noticed that the individual DOB is that day.  Then we got hungry and our friend haven't arrived yet and so we ordered appetizers. The appetizers were great no doubt. so we told our server that we are doing the 2 for 25 dollars (comes with salad or soup, pizza and pizookie). I ordered the clam chowder soup, which is a lil bit salty, then we decided to order the Deep dish spicy hawaiian pizza, my friend notice that the pizza did not with chicken and so they have to make another one with the correct order and we ended up having 2 deep dish pizza, and then the pizookie (as always there were to die for).  while we were eating my friend notice a lil friend on the floor (roach) and he took a picture of it. he tried to say something to the server but we can't get his attention. i have the photo of the lil friend if you want to see it. haha.  all in all i was disappointed at the service. i was expecting better service especially coz it's my special day.  3 star because of the pizookie that i always love. message me if you have some question.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park?start=20

While the service here remains extremely good (We all love Annie behind the bar), the food that I took home was a major disappointment. My ravioli was just sloppy and did not include the garlic bread that is clearly listed with this item on the menu. Also, the Santa Fe salad was also disappointing and did not come with the dressing on the side which is almost always the case when I order salads for take-out virtually anywhere else. Considering both entrees run near $15 a piece, the kitchen could at least make them worthwhile and not create that ""Oh, no"" moment when opening the bags at home and preparing for what was supposed to be a nice dinner. In my opinion, BJ's continues to waste great employees like Annie and others as well as a nice TV wall with their refusal to air audio of sporting events in the bar area.

Brian M.,"Tampa, FL",1610,507,7691,2.0,12/1/2015,"At the suggestion of a coworker, we visited BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse located at Citrus Park Mall off Gunn Highway and the Veterans Expressway, not too far from our office for lunch. I got the Parmesan Crusted Chicken topped with lemon Chardonnay butter sauce, sun-dried tomatoes, fresh basil, Parmesan cheese, with white cheddar mashed potatoes, and steamed broccoli. Unfortunately, it was really missing flavoring and left me craving for something more. My coworker got the New Orleans Jambalaya with blackened chicken breast, shrimp, chicken andouille sausage, bell peppers, white onions, tomatoes, in a spicy sauce, served over rice pilaf and he was a little dissapointed that it was too dry. My other coworker got the Garlic Chicken Pesto Flatbread Pizza with grilled chicken breast, basil pesto, fire-roasted red bell peppers, artichoke hearts, tomatoes, parmesan, and goat cheese. He really liked it and ate the whole thing. You can't screw pizza up ever lol. The decor is pretty average and unmemorable. Cons: Over the phone, BJ's Brewhouse told us they had plenty of lunch specials but when we got there their lunch menu had only 4 items. I didn't want pizza or salad so were forced to order off the dinner menu for $15-$18 per plate which is higher than average for lunch. Service was terribly slow for a place advertising come here for work lunch. I had to ask the waiter 3 times to put my order in and we had to wait over 15 minutes to get our checks and then another 5 minutes to pass the pen around. Considering we had over 15 people and over 3 tables of people, you think we would've got more than 1 server. People kept asking where the heck did the server go?  One of my coworker's $12 burgers came without tomatoes and onions which is a basic burger topic every burger should have. He ended up eating the whole burger before the server showed up again so he didn't bother asking.
