Morgan R.,"Houston, TX",197,85,98,4.0,10/9/2017,"First let me say, I only come here for PIZOOKIES!!!!!! I'm not originally from Texas, but when my friend introduced me to the deliciousness that is the pizookie, I was hooked! They have several different flavors of pizookies available and two sizes.  The regular size is perfect for two people! I recommend the classic chocolate chunk pizookie! It's served warm in a pizza pan with vanilla ice cream on top.  The cookies and cream pizookie is also quite nice if you want to branch out.  If you really want to enjoy your pizookie, DO NOT LOOK AT THE NUTRITIONAL INFO ON THE MENU. I love getting the pizookies here - they're a great treat to share with friends and family!  The restaurant is quite large, so the tables turn over pretty quickly, and there is plenty of parking available.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-college-station-2
Sara N.,"Burleson County, TX",93,5,1,3.0,9/10/2017,"Ok. I've been here a few times and decided that after last week I would go ahead and write a review. I want to first start by saying that, I love the whole concept around this restaurant. The menu is full of amazing things at somewhat pricy restaurant. Here are my issues.  For one thing, a salad is the simplest items on a menu to do right, right? So, WHY, do I keep receiving rotting greens? Quality control could easily fix this problem. I know tender greens get bruised and yucky fairly easy. Just go through it and throw the gross pieces out, I don't want it in my food. It's really not hard! Second time coming and for the second time, I once again got gross, rotting, mushy greens mixed  my salad. Bj's, STOP IT! If you're the manager and reading this, your getting 3 stars over LETTUCE! Fix it!!  My other issue is the promptness of your staff. I don't want to run out of water. When I'm ready for my check, I don't want to wait 20 minutes for it to finally come to me once I have asked for it. I was there on two occasions and it wasn't busy. Check your patrons, stop being lazy, and, if all else fails and your staff has NOTHING to do, sort the damn greens! See! Problem solved for you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-college-station-2
Ross P.,"Katy, TX",16,42,1,4.0,1/9/2018,"For a chain they did a GREAT job. Food was very fresh, hot and fast. Had the flatbread pizza and the bartender recommended a side of extra marinara and it made all the difference in the world.

Dustin A.,"Dallas, TX",38,1,,1.0,12/23/2017,"Just left after sitting there for 20 minutes and the server only coming by our table once.  I have ate at several BJs across the country and talked my parents into trying a new place today.  The service really needs work, beside our slow server you really didn't see anyone that worked there moving like they cared about the customers....... unlikely that I will return to this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-college-station-2
Jasmine Y.,"College Station, TX",120,102,76,1.0,6/24/2017,"Absolutely not coming back. The service was terrible and the food was oily and flavorless. My parents and I ordered the appetizer sampler, jambalaya, deep dish pizza, ahi tuna salad and asparagus and shrimp penne. Their serving sizes are huge but needless to say I brought half of our food home because it just wasn't seasoned well at all. The jambalaya just tasted with tomato paste porridge with over cooked shrimp and dried out sausage. The ahi tuna salad was straight up drizzled with wasabi and had more tortilla chips than lettuce in it. The penne pasta was over cooked and tasted like nothing. The appetizer platter was alright but everything was so oily it was hard to eat any of it. However, the deep dish pizza was pretty good. Our waitress hardly minded us, she would literally disappear into the kitchen and not come out for a good 10 minutes and we'd have to wait for water for 15 minutes as well as to go boxes and the check. Terrible service. I see how the restaurant was busy, but the other servers were serving their tables just fine!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-college-station-2

Kacy M.,"Houston, TX",191,262,467,3.0,11/27/2016,The wait here is horrendous. This restaurant is packed literally 24/7. Once I even had a reservation here and they wouldn't seat us until a certain number of people showed up. Um hello? Then why the heck would I even reserve seats... The food here isn't even good or special. Whenever I come here (for birthdays) I get the Cajun pasta which is not the best compared to Cheddar's or Cheesecake Factory's versions. The only decent items on the menu are the alcoholic beverages or the pizookie (which you could make easily at home...).

It was our 10 year anniversary- sat at the bar for a drink and an appetizer- we got beautiful drinks, guac & spinach and artichoke dip. 3 bites into my artichoke dip- I used the spoon to put it on my chip, and got a cheekful of PAPER TOWEL! I told the bartender who just grabbed both of the plates and handed them off to someone else, and continued working. Another girl came over and said we were prize winners of paper towel in our food and can she interest us in dessert. No thanks. My husband asked how this happened and she said well the paper towel holder is hanging over the dip in the kitchen. Im speechless at this point.

I was ecstatic to get pizookies, I haven't had one in years. When I arrived at my boyfriends house, I opened the food to notice what BJ's considers a ""pizookie""- a half ass attempt at a cookie cake that doesn't even fill the box it's in. My smores pizookie, however, was very much all there. It was the cookies and cream one that was messed up.

JD G.,"Austin, TX",323,182,52,4.0,3/29/2017,"I'm fairly happy with my experience at BJ's...the food is consistently good, the service is great for the most part (with the exception of the stupid greeters), and their prices are reasonable. I thought I would address one of the complaints that people have about BJ's, which is the wait. If you were smart, you could avoid every having to wait. With the app, you can put your name on the waiting list before ever leaving your house or work to eat. Even better, if you're in a huge hurry, you can even order ON THE APP before you even sit down, that way when you do get seated, they're already cooking your food so you only have to wait on your server to bring your drinks. That's super impressive to me and I love doing that...you just have to get the greeters on board because they essentially have to check you in, and they don't always do that right, which frustrates me. So basically, if you wait, that's your fault...you can't blame anyone but yourself :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-college-station-2

Cathie V.,"College Station, TX",8,19,,2.0,8/9/2017,"We arrived early for dinner, the restaurant was practically empty on a Wednesday. The hostess sat us right away to the furthest table from the front door, in front of the kitchen. Since the restaurant was nearly empty we asked for a booth closer to the front or center. The hostess wanted us to follow her back through the empty restaurant to the greeting area to have us re seated. My husband picked a table on the way and told her it would be fine. When we asked for a second glass of water it finally arrived when we were done eating. My husbands chicken meal was fine however my coleslaw had no dressing whatsoever - it must've just been served right out of the bag of slaw. Oh, and the napkins on the table when we were finally seated were very damp; we had to ask for dried napkins. No reason to return here with so many other good restaurants in town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-college-station-2?start=20
Samuel C.,"Austin, TX",93,668,,4.0,12/9/2015,"Great room. Average food which is getting better over time. One TERRIFIC item BJ's is a chain, and not a bad one. As Chili's steadily degenerates with cost cutting, short staffing and undertrained cooks - BJ's has become my new go-to for an all-American-bar-and-restaurant place. The decorating is terrific. You walk in and you immediately feel happy and that you are about to eat and drink very well. (Whether or not you actually WILL eat well is a bit of a dice roll at BJ's  but hope always springs eternal when a restaurant is spacious and classy.) The bar is heavy on corporate microbrews, and commercial flavored vodkas -  meaning this is not what I am looking for in a place to drink. Much of the food is ""that's nice dear"". The star of their show is the pizza. The pizza is dramatically better than what you would expect from a chain American place. What is their secret? Instead of tomato sauce, they use actual seasoned tomatoes. Using real tomatoes rather than commercial pizza sauce makes all of the difference in the world  on a pizza. American pizza sauce is flavorless red paint - that you make taste like something by dumping pepperoni on top of it. Real tomatoes taste like tomatoes - and BJ's pizza actually tastes fresh. Add that they have the strong flavored ""other ingredients"" that other pizza places ought to stock but don't. Anchovies. Asparagus Seasoned Brussels sprouts. And all the normal meat items you would like to see like italian sausage and bacon to allow you to forget the fact you are eating all of those vegetables. (Waiter, I'll take the bacon bacon bacon bacon and Brussels sprouts pizza!  Tell my doctor I'm eating healthy!) But jokes aside, actual decent ingredients with real tastes combined with genuine bona fide tomatoes means that you have a pizza that does not taste like a cardboard frisbee that has just been home delivered from Domino's. This is where I intend to hang out for a year or three while I wait for Chili's to decide if they actually want to serve food or they just want to concentrate on profits.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-college-station-2?start=20

Nancy J.,"Calvert, TX",5,23,,3.0,6/27/2016,"This is only a three because my husband said the craft beer was good.  We were seated quickly (plus) by a fake-y hostess who shouted, ""Absolutely!"" each time we asked a question or made any comment (such as ""Thank you.""). (Minus) Server came quickly (plus). We ordered an appetizer and thin crust pizza to share. Took a while for the appetizer, no problem. However, no sooner had we taken a bite of the appetizer, than our pizza arrived. The appetizer (avocado egg rolls) were pretty good but we didn't get to enjoy them. Appetizers are actually supposed to come before your meal.  The thin crust was fine around the edges - for the first piece. Center pieces were totally soggy. When my husband bit into a second crust piece, it had gone soggy. (Minus, minus, minus) This is not the reason for ordering thin crust pizza -you want it crispy. We looked at the serving dish. It was plastic. Maybe the reason for the soggy crust?  Come on, for those prices you can do better.

Gina H.,"College Station, TX",0,4,,1.0,8/14/2017,"What do I say? I've been coming here for 6 years, maybe twice or three times a year. I keep trying to give them the benefit of the doubt because the food is pretty darn good and the atmosphere is decent. But, seriously, the front of house problems never.get.fixed. The cooks, the dishwashers, and the bartenders are doing a bang-up job, but whoever's managing front of house (and I suspect they have tremendous turnover there because it continues to suck) have just been royally f***ing up- for 6 straight years. I have to believe that it's a franchise/ownership problem because I hate to blame the servers and hosts/hostesses themselves although obviously there's huge turnover there too. I've waited 20 min to be seated with multiple empty tables (scheduling); I've been seated with no service for 15-20 min on multiple occasions (scheduling and training); I've been seated and orders taken but no water, no silverware, no check-ins for 20, srsly sometimes 25 min (training/management). Tonight, a Monday during the summer when there was clearly not a crowd, we and every other patron who came in were asked, ""Are you part of our loyalty program?"" ""No? Well, 20 mimutes wait.""

Also, we found out that they were doing a big anything get a pizza cookie free off the menu.  I seriously expected the waiters to be upset when so many of us used a coupon, but they were absolutely great and very accommodating.

There's a BJs in my home town, so I was looking forward to see how it chalked up As soon as we walked in, we were greeted and taken to a booth. I got the strawberry lemonade to start with, and I firmly believe that BJs has the best strawberry lemonade I have ever tasted As an appetizer, we got mozzarella sticks, potato skins, and calamari. Mozzarella sticks really went above and beyond; great taste and AMAZING stretch factor. Potato skins seemed overcooked, and although I personally didn't eat the calamari, the rest of the family said its ""eh"".  Main course, there was pizzas and the shrimp-asparagus pasta. Pizzas were delicious, as to be expected, and the pasta was lacking in the meat department  The service here was great; the waitress was always there to refill my lemonade, and she got us whatever we requested with a smile.  Overall, this is a nice place to eat, albeit a little pricey. Great food, great service, and a great time.  Below are quotes from my family: ""I thought potato skins were like mini baked potatoes, not this"" ""I like the stage that the pizza was on"" ""This was 90% pasta and 10% shrimp"" ""The mozzarella sticks stretched for like 10 miles"" ""Good pizza""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-college-station-2?start=20

Pauline L.,"Kirkland, WA",447,194,1832,3.0,10/3/2013,"I ordered a beer sampler, which was supposed to be 5 oz and they came out with what I know to be only 2 oz. As a baker, I know what my ounces look like and I am pretty bitter that they jipped me on alcohol. I did jot pay $3 for 3 oz less than what you're supposed to give me. I ordered the bison burger. It came out, was smaller than I expected to get from a restaurant. Islands' Burgers are so much bigger and better. The patty was just normal sized and didn't taste all that different from regular beef. The ""coleslaw"" that came with it was NASTY. It was so flavorless and was basically cabbage and maybe some other shredded vegetable. I had to ask for extra chipotle BBQ sauce (which wasn't all that astounding; could be something you buy at the store) and smothered the coleslaw in order to eat it. I wouldn't order this again for $9. Not worth it. I'd rather go back to my favorite Carter's Burgers. I tried my friend's berry beer and Irish Root Beer. They were very good. I don't like normal beer, so these sweet or fruity drinks really were up my alley. Service was nice but a little slow, considering it was the night when everyone is trying to eat out at night because all these undergrads got their rings. A good experience I had at this place was my first time here with my BF a couple months ago. I ordered the Thai Mango Salad and the endless root beer. This salad was awesome. I should have just ordered this again, but it was like $3 more than the burger. The sauce was great, the mangoes tasty, the crispy wontons were a nice addition. I bet this is one of the better items compared to the individual pizzas or the bison burger.

I don't mind paying what are high prices for good food. And when BJ's is good, it's really good. Their deep dish BJ's favorite is delicious. Look online at the picture and your mouth will water. The pizza in the picture is near the top of the pan and full of meat and veggies. When we got our recent pizza delivered I actually thought we got the wrong pizza because it didn't even come half way up the pan, and as I pointed out to our waitress half the pizza was missing peppers and olives. It was like they had a contest to make the fastest pizza and just threw ingredients on without any pride. I'm not kidding you, 30% of the pizza was just dough and not toppings. When I showed the waitress our pizza she said ""what can I do?""  So I flippantly said free pizookies. She said she would see what she could do. When it was time (we ordered a large pizza that was $24.75 folks!). To get our free desserts we found out it was one mini, a $3.33 retail value. At that point I didn't even want it, but they brought it. Then the manager on duty came over and did his ""hey Bro"" squat at the table and said ""sorry you had a bad experience"". For $25 pizza that feeds two I really just want a good pizza. He kept saying ""what can I do?""  When I told him the dough was actually uncooked and didn't rise he educated me in pizza dough proofing. Is it my job to train him that for a pizza as poor as this he should have made us another one and not had us leave irritated. Anyway, I love the restaurant.

A sloppy waiter with his tips in his shirt front pocket, half untucked, un-ironed, food/armpit stains. It seems like a classy place. However, staff is more about hanging out together at a booth or in the corner rather than helping people. Homebrew is tastey. But NOT worth $6 per glass (which I was unaware of). A few beers and a mediocre appetizer was close to $30. I had to get up 3 times to request a refill as our waiter never would come back (3pm and it was empty).

Also as Greg D. mention previously, they do not brew beer at any Bj's. They brew it at St. Aronld's and ship it to their locations.

Vince U.,"Ennis, TX",4,5,5,4.0,9/21/2014,"Came to College Station to visit my brother and we came in on a totally not-busy Sunday afternoon around 2:30. The very Amy Winehouse-looking host greeted us immediately when we walked through the revolving doors. We sat down and the server was super nice (my brother also works at this location) and he asked for our drink orders and I realized the huge draft selection they have (it's a brewhouse, duh but I forgot) and I orderd the Hopstorm IPA since I'm on an IPA craze right now. He also took our appetizer order, calamari. Drinks came out super fast and he took our main order the second time and also answered menu questions that my mom had. The calamari was fresh and came out in a decent serving size, also had the legs of the squid. Dipped those in ranch and marijuana and it was great. I ordered  another beer (Jeremiah Red) right before the food came out and I decided I liked the first beer better because I'm not too big on malty beers. I ordered the BJ's Favorite Hand-tossed pizza: it came with meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green bell peppers, black olives and white onions. My mom ordered the ribeye steak which she loved because it was cooked thorougly with a tad bit of red, not dry at all, real juicy. My brother ordered thr Shrimp Scampi Pasta ( I tried it and the shrimp were medium sized, juicy and the roma tomatoes and light angel hair pasta all paired well). My pizza was very hearty and meaty, with thicker crust than I had imagined. Kind of reminded me of a thick-crusted supreme pizza from Pizza Hut, if I want to be honest. The only difference is is was more rich than a Pizza Hut pizza would be. Overall, the waiter was quick to respond to our needs, refills were quickly satisfied and we even topped it off with the pazookie as a dessert (it's a 3 cookie sampler, it was amazingly rich in chocolate and caramel and you can pick up to 3 different cookies). Left a nice tip and the hostess wished us a safe goodbye! I recommend this place during the really relaxed atmospheric time we went because my brother says it gets really busy any other time, especially during Aggie game days.

Alex M.,"Austin, TX",1,14,1,3.0,12/27/2012,"Pros: Awesome beer selection Knowledgeable bartender Great orange cream soda Good prices Lots of TV's Cons: Hawaiian Mahi Mahi was dry. Might be over-cooked. Didn't taste fresh. :( The fried rice that came with it was a little too oily. The dish can use less oil for the rice; instead, add some sort of sauce maybe a katsu sauce for the fish. It'll definitely bring out the ""hawaiian."" The egg rolls were nice.

Kyle W.,"Bryan, TX",18,10,7,1.0,9/15/2011,"No one would follow up and check on us....we had to pull a ""Tonya Harding"" and trip the nearest server walking by us to get anything.   (No one was really tripped). Our supposed designated server who was the only one to receive whatever tip we left (which ended up being 8%) spent her whole time attending to a large table without even an apology or telling us she was going to give us to someone else.  We had three servers in 2 hours.   The restaurant was NOT full.    Nice revolving door and nice decor but we left and went to the less attractive Fox and Hound and had excellent service.  That's where I'll return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-college-station-2?start=80

Mary B.,"College Station, TX",0,7,,5.0,5/4/2015,This is by far my favorite restaurant to visit when I have the extra time and money lying around. Both the food and drink selection are more diverse than any other establishment I've had the pleasure of trying during my five years in College Station. The food menu has enough options to satisfy even the pickiest of eaters. My favorite part is the beer menu. Their in in house-brewed options are fantastic and will leave even the most experienced home brewers pleased. Definitely worth a try!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-college-station-2?start=80
Boyd V.,"Port Aransas, TX",0,3,2,4.0,11/16/2014,"This was exceptional food starting from the Avocado  Egg Rolls (wow) to the Lasagna (wow) and Flatbread to the Pizookie (oh my)!  The operating hours limited our decision to a handful of options but it was a great one!  The service was fine.  They were busy and we had two to assist us and we had no issues at all. Everything that did not come out right away, silverware, extra water, etc but we asked for it and it came back right away.  Definitely recommend and definitely will go back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-college-station-2?start=80
Hunger E.,"Houston, TX",9,376,11,2.0,6/8/2013,"NOTORIETY:  Pizookie dessert FOOD:      Piranha Pale Ale Chili Cheeseburger:  By name, it sounds like it would be good.  In reality, meh.  The chili, made w/ the ale, which was not properly combined w/ other ingredients, so the chili tasted too bitter.  My buddy tried a spoon of the chili & described it like eating medicine.  Enough said.  I was able to finish it as the ~$12 price tag will motivate you to not waste food, as unappetizing as it may be. OVERALL:  BJ's is a pricey restaurant for the quality of food that you get.  I've had the pizza & this burger as entrees, both of which I am not a fan of.  It gets those 2 stars b/c of the pizookie, otherwise I'd give it a 1.  The only other reason I'd imagine going here are for sports, as it has numerous TVs. RECOMMENDATION:  Pizookie TIPS: 1. On your bday, they offer you a free pizookie when you tell your server its your special day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-college-station-2?start=80

Krystal I.,"Boyett, TX",7,4,,5.0,4/20/2015,"I eat there several times a month so I figured time for a review! The main draw is that they are open late, and since I get off work late it's the best food in town at that time. A little pricey, which is why we keep our visits to only a few times a month, but it's definitely a treat! Especially the pizookies! Get the cookies and cream one! And calamari appetizer is a must :) The traditional deep dish pizza is always on point. I try to go early as early as possible after work becuase in the last hour they cut down to one server and seat everyone in cocktail, which would be fine if it wasn't always so busy at that time! Service is incredible regardless; there's only one server out of the dozens that I've had there that I don't like, his name is Kyle I think, but the other 99% of the time the service is awesome and the food is great, so I gave 5 stars :) Managers are always friendly and fun to talk to, the hostesses always smile and are polite, exactly what you'd expect for the prices. Besides the one server, I haven't had any other bad experiences, which is impressive since I've been there about a hundred times since I've lived in CS",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-college-station-2?start=60

Jeffrey P.,"Montgomery, TX",1,14,1,2.0,9/1/2014,"BJ's better turn this ship around... I don't know if they are growing too quickly, or what, but the quality at BJ's has been going down the last couple of times we have gone there. It also irritates me that they have big posters displaying seasonal beers that they are ALWAYS OUT OF! Yesterday, our waiter spent more time flirting with the hostess than he did taking care of our table (before he went on lunch break).  His attitude was also annoying when my son asked if he could have vanilla added to his Dr. Pepper and the waiter just looked at him like he was stupid and gave a terse, ""No!""

Tyler M.,"Milroy Farms, TX",17,90,44,4.0,2/14/2016,Went on Valentine's Day expecting crowds and all that but we beat the crowds and we were promptly seated at our table. Our waiter came over his name was Kyle like the field he said which I thought was clever. He asked what we wanted to drink but we ask for just another minute so he left and came back after a minute or two. My mom still wasn't really sure what she wanted to drink (didn't know it was that hard but ok) so he recommended several drinks and was very patient and we finally ordered drinks. They promptly came out he even brought out a sample of one of the drinks he recommended for us to taste and it was good. Now onto food! We ordered to caprese salads and I had the poke (pronounced Pokeh it a Hawaiian thing) basically raw tuna with a soy sauce avocado and onions man it was fantastic. I then had the double burger which Kyle told me was going away next week so beware of that. It to was awesome bereft seasoning nice bum toppings were a good compliment to the beef but not too much. Of course then we had to try a pizzokie which as usual was awesome.

Minda W.,"Austin, TX",200,198,171,1.0,3/8/2013,"Avoid going here at all costs. It's so awful. Part 1 (Waiting): First off, they only take reservations for groups of 1-6. Who does that? Really. Anyway, we (a group of 10) waited for a table for 45 minutes at 8:30pm on a Thursday night. They had a completely empty section and had told us that it would be a 20 minute wait. What the heck. Part 2 (More waiting): It took 40 minutes to get our food out and 20 minutes from seating for the waiter to take our order. That's a total of 1 hour 45 minutes of waiting for the most mediocre food I have ever experienced. Part 3 (Food): We got the Crispy Jalepeno Burger and the California Club; both were too soggy with grease to even pick up. Both were way too salty and also way too soggy. Our friends got steak ($17), porkchops ($15), and fish (also expensive) and the portion size were less than one serving of meat total (all of them were about the size of a deck of cards). It was completely overpriced garbage. Part 4 (Service): Was there any? They were slow and unobservant. He was nice, but he forgot a bunch of our requests both during ordering and after.
