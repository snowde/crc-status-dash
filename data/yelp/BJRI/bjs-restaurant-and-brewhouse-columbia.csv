J T.,"Montgomery Village, MD",6,162,1,1.0,12/22/2017,"The food is okay, however the service is really lousy. We were there yesterday with an office Christmas party and our server at first acted like she couldn't give us happy hour prices, we were there a little after 3! She also behaved like she was completely overwhelmed. I mean this goes, for the computer they make them key into and also just with taking general orders and basic skills of being friendly. She never once came back and asked how we were doing, if we'd like more drinks, food etc. I have to say the BJ's in Laurel is MUCH better and, I will NOT be returning to this Columbia location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbia?start=20
Eli N.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",12,234,134,3.0,10/19/2017,"Food was good. Definitely gotta go with the Peruvian Bowl with Quinoa and Salmon. The deep dish pizzas are good too. Service was slow, really slow. The server was nice and friendly. 3 stars is just right for this place as it's just an upscale ale house.

Brad F.,"Chula Vista, CA",22,59,10,1.0,5/17/2017,"My most recent visit to BJ's was my sixth to this location and most likely my last. Each time my experience at the restaurant becomes worse.  On the current visit we were greeted and seated in a efficient manner.  Our drink order was taken quickly but after the order was taken 25 minutes went by and we still hadn't received our beers nor given any water. The first thing brought to our table after 20 minutes of waiting was a bottle of ketchup. I had to stop our waitress and ask if our drinks were ready. She said oh yeah like it was an inconvenience to her. She then brought our drinks right away.  We finished our beers and our food still had not arrived, probably 40/45 minutes into being seated. Our waitress never stopped at our table to ask if we wanted another drink but did have time to joke around with her co-workers.  Finally at about 50 minutes in our food arrived. I had ordered the original wings (the description said they would be crispy but nothing was crispy about them) they were average but the portion size was adequate. My wife ordered something along the lines of the honey chicken salad. It looked like a bag of tiny shredded lettuce was dumped in a bowl and topped with honey covered chicken strips. So much lettuce, too much lettuce.  Once again I had to stop the waitress to ask for another drink which she went and grabbed right away. We had to wait about 15 minutes for the check.  I hate to mention this but it's true and unpleasant so I will. In the past I was waited on by a rather large sized waitress. This waitress had a terrible Oder coming off of her. It was so strong I almost lost my appetite. On my most recent visit I was looking down at my menu and I started smelling that awful smell again. Sure enough, I turn around and the same waitress is at the table behind me taking an order.  Management should address this issue. It alone is enough to not make me want to eat there any more.  Additionally, each time the servers/service becomes slower and more relaxed.  I would like to note that there is one waitress we had that provided excellent customer service. I don't remember her name but she was a tiny blonde woman probably late 20s early 30s. Too bad the other servers aren't up to her caliber.  Another occurrence from a previous visit involved my wife and I ordering beers. The waitress first came back and told me they were out of my beer took another beer choice then left. She then came back with out any beer and told my wife they were out of the beer she ordered (both were BJs beers by the way). She left again and some random waiter dropped off a beer that neither one of us had asked for. The manager then came over and said they had made a mistake and both the original beers we had ordered were in fact there. So after about 30 minutes we had our beers and not offered a discount or other way to apologize.  I like the beer but I just can't beer to eat at BJ's any more (that was a pun by the way).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbia?start=20
Sarah B.,"Arlington, VA",0,6,,1.0,9/9/2017,Our group of ten arrived to find the hostess didnt have the table they reserved for us. Before rousting two toddlers and an array of family members (ages 6 weeks to 88years) we called to see if they could accommodate us and the hostess said we they had two tables available and she would hold one for us. When we arrived less than 10 minutes (the max she said they would hold the table) later they unapologetically said they seated someone at one of those tables and that their manager said they couldn't hold the other--this strong leader manager never made an appearance while we spoke dumbfounded to a gaggle of hostesses none of whom offered an apology or made any effort to accommodate us. Clearly this is not a family friendly restaurant and belongs in Georgetown not Columbia.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbia?start=20
Savannah L.,"Mount Hope, KS",31,1,,5.0,1/8/2018,"Wow, what an experience! Not only was our server amazing and attentive, but the happy hour is best by far. It was pretty busy when we came but the server communicated well and our food actually came out at a pretty decent time. Me and my husband decided to split 2 entrees and Terrell went above and beyond to split each one for us without asking. It's refreshing to to see great customer service like we had. Overall we had great deals, delicious spaghetti (literally to die for) and outstanding service. Coming from Dallas, Tx where we had such a wide range variety of restaurants , I'm definitely satisfied with this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbia?start=20
Khalilah A.,"Owings Mills, MD",2,6,,3.0,12/14/2017,"Standard restaurant there was really nothing that stood out service, food, and ambience were average. It's a restaurant you go to when there isn't anywhere else to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbia?start=20
Ashley H.,"Columbia, MD",16,3,,1.0,11/18/2017,"If I could give this no stars, I would. To start - we called hours in advance and the hostess took our name, number, and told us we'd be seated at 7:15. When we got there, at 7:10, we were told it would be a 20 minute wait.  The hostesses attitudes were an immediate turnoff. The hostess at the door didn't smile, greet us, or anything - just stared at me until I told her we had a reservation. When we were taken to our table, the hostess didn't look at us, say anything to us, just walked us to a table and threw the menus down. She didn't say a word and walked off. Now, this was the better service of the evening.  When our waiter arrived, I was happy. He was energetic, excited, and detailed. After taking our drink orders, he dissapeared for 15 minutes before bringing the drinks. After we ordered, he didn't take the menus. We ended up sitting the entire evening with menus on the table. After we were finished our appetizer, we waited upwards of 35 minutes for two pizzas. When they finally arrived, we had to ask for plates. After receiving the pizzas we didn't see the waiter for an hour. He did not check in, ask how it was, or refill our drinks. We only received one drink refill the entire time we were there and sat with empty cups the whole time. Incredibly dissapointing. The worst part, was that he did return to the section twice in fifteen minutes, and was attentive to all of the tables behind and around us. Some of the worst service I have ever received.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbia?start=20
Daniel P.,"Woodstock, MD",104,49,74,3.0,9/23/2017,"They do a decent job here. I got the Hawaiian pizza which has pineapple, chicken, and jalapenos. Also ordered a red Amber ale which tasted fresh. I have had the flat bread and wings in the past. Great stuff.  They have a curro dessert which is really good. Don't forget to order that! The service is really lacking in terms of man power. They need to either hire more people or have the table service buttons so we can call a waiter up when we need them. It's extremely fustrating trying to get a hold of someone because they are either nowhere to be seen or busy with other customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbia?start=20
Jessi S.,"Columbia, MD",79,20,13,3.0,12/30/2017,"I think the popularity of the restaurant only has to do with the fact that it is new in the Columbia area. I visited for happy hour on a weekday and it was packed! Almost had a tough time finding seats together at the bar for 3 people. Service was a bit slow at first, but it was busy. We all tried their house brews and were satisfied! The amber and red ales were my fave. We ordered a bunch of small plates to share between us: chips and salsa were good, but nothing special (for $3), spinach and artichoke dip was yummy and I liked that they had large artichoke chunks in it but I think it should come with a dipper other than tortilla chips. Since the other food we ordered hadn't come out yet, the kitchen sent out garlic bread with marinara to make up for the lag- not something I would have ordered otherwise. Our avocado egg rolls arrived, simple and tasty and I enjoyed the sauce that came with it. The mini deep dish pizzas were on HH so we got 3 to split: great white, buffalo chicken, and chicken bacon ranch. They were good! And I liked that they had more than one white pizza option since I'm not a red sauce fan. Last, but not least, we got the 3 sampler pizookies, the best part of our entire dinner! Don't miss out on these diabetic traps!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbia?start=20
Melissa S.,"Woodbine, MD",7,5,,5.0,6/13/2017,I don't understand why this place has 3 stars. After 2 failed attempts to get into this place my family and I finally got in (really long wait times on a weekend night). Am I upset about that? NO! That tells me that this place is THAT good. Well it is. We went for lunch on a Saturday. My daughter ordered a kids burger and my two sons got the kids chicken tenders to share. I had a piece of the chicken and it was really good! Usually chicken tenders at restaurants suck but they were juicy and flavorful. I ordered the Hickory brisket and bacon burger. It was huge and sooooo good. I can't remember what burger my husband ordered but there was nothing left on his plate so I'd say he liked it. Also their fries are like crack! Once you start eating them you can't stop. I could just order a bucket of fries and be happy.  On to the next part...our service was top notch. We took a while to order because there was so many things that sounded good so by the time we ordered and were waiting my two sons (2 1/2 and 10 months) were getting restless and hungry and I was running out of puffs. Our server brought 3 little plates filled with fruit and garlic knots (which again are so freakin delicious) for my kids to keep them happy. It was a life saver. They were completely complementary. Anyone with hungry kids in a restaurant know that this type of kindness is a Godsend. I wish I could remember our server's name so I could give her a shout out. She was very sweet and understanding of our craziness. Don't listen to all the bad reviews on here. Give BJ's a try and remember it's still fairly new there is going to be a wait on the weekends,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbia?start=20
Katey T.,"Laurel, MD",0,1,,1.0,12/27/2017,"The service sucks, food was cold, didn't receive silverware until well after food had arrived, consistently forgot our order for blue cheese dressing, and never asked for and forgot our refills on drinks.

Did our server bother to check on us or apologize NOPE! We were literally going to leave because we were starving and had places to be, but luckily our food came out before we did. And no surprise here my pizza came out warm border line cold. I did not have time for them to make me another.  Also to top if off just for us to get our check and boxes back took another 20 plus minutes.

Sayed I.,"Columbia, MD",1,22,,4.0,5/11/2017,"Good food, great service, cool atmosphere. It is at the end of the shopping center, furthest from the garage/Tesla SC.  It has a sportsbar restaurant feel, similar to RR or GT.  As for the food, I would recommend the Jambalaya and any of the Salmon dishes.  Overall, BJs has a good selection for kids, as it is kid-friendly.  Additionally they have several seafood dishes for the non meat eaters and tasty desserts ""fit"" for those who don't give a damn about watching their weight.

Jared J.,"Washington, DC",14,132,5,3.0,3/29/2017,"The food is generally good, but there is quite some room for improvement.  First, BJ's needs to either accept reservations or live and die on a ""first come, first served"" basis. This ""phone ahead"" situation isn't working. One recent Saturday evening, the girlfriend and I ""phoned ahead"" hours in advance, yet were forced to wait outside with the masses for half an hour before we got a table.  While we waited patiently, another patron exploded in an apoplectic rage at the hostess. Some people in Columbia cannot handle a little inconvenience.   Speaking of the patronage and apoplexy, why are there so many children in a brewhouse? Have the parents of Howard County lost their collective minds?  Which brings me to the beer. BJ's suffers from the same affliction as local restaurant (and soon-to-be chain) Victoria's: greed. These restaurants have an in-house brewery producing mediocre beer that the restaurants then eagerly sell to diners at the same price as or at a higher price than other, more reputable craft brews. The profit margins are through the roof.  On that note, BJ's: please take your beers off of nitro. You're doing it wrong.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbia?start=20
Gerry P.,"Gaithersburg, MD",123,15,7,3.0,7/15/2017,"Not a bad choice for lunch, the hubs and I purposely came here because we have eaten at one in California and wanted more.  We came in around 1 on a Saturday, we were seated quickly, even though it's was a little busy. The server was fast to greet us and get our drinks. She returned and got out order fast, we were really happy with the service.  The food isn't quite what I remember. We ordered the Brussel Sprouts as an app, the sauce tasted good but the sprouts themselves were a little to done. We both got tomato and mozzarella salads, they came out quickly, and tested great. Our food followed suit with a quick delivery, hubs got the crispy jalapeño burger and loved it. I got the chicken bacon ranch piadena, it was ok.

Natalie N.,"Santa Maria Novella, Florence, Italy",126,12,8,1.0,6/20/2017,"This review is for the hostess at this location. My Asian parents arrived before me and my boyfriend and requested a booth, where we typically sit. The hostess blatantly told them no twice because there are no servers. Mind you, there are already 2 people sitting in the booth right next to the one that they requested. So my parents decided to go out and wait for us to come. When we came, my boyfriend (a tall, white male) asked to be seated at the same booth and the hostess had no trouble fulfilling his request. This really upset my parents because they have NEVER been treated like this at any other establishments. Our server, Juan, was AMAZING but his customer service was overshadowed by the discrimination that my parents faced from the hostess. What made this worse was that when the manager found out, he did not address this situation right away but waited until the bill was paid. We are not seeking for any discounts or free services. By addressing this issue at the very end, it made us feel as though management did not deem this issue important enough to address it ASAP. Will not be coming back. Thanks for the small effort at the end though but everyone should be treated equally regardless of race. Hope you really take this into consideration and not make up or listen to the excuses from your discriminating hostess.

Anna F.,"Baltimore, MD",73,104,30,4.0,5/26/2017,I dined at BJ's restaurant and brewhouse on May 24 with my friend.  The ambiance reminds me of Columbia Alehouse.  There are televisions for sports fan to watch their favorite home team.  Our server was very nice and answered all of our questions. I like that Bj's Brewhouse has an app which I downloaded.  I also found a free appetizer coupon online and was able to order the New Beginnings which is a sampler of multiple appetizers.  Wednesdays are the loaded burger specials for $10 and unlimited french fries.  It was also $4 craft beers for the BJ's brewed beer.  I ordered the guacamole and bacon burger and it was really good. I did not take advantage of the unlimited french fries because I had so much food to eat already. The french fries were crisp and evenly salted. I liked my craft beer and the New Beginnings appetizer was good also. My friend and I had to take our food home since there was so much but this restaurant is a bang for your buck! I would definitely come back.  The only thing that gave this review 4 stars is the man who brought our burgers to us did not know if my burger had the side sauce.  He answered me in a rude way when I asked about my sauce.  Somehow my sauce ended up in my friend's burger but as someone who brings food to the customer should know where my sauce is.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbia?start=80

I ordered the cherry chipotle salmon. The salmon tasted good, however the asparagus was so tough it was inedible. The couscous and spinach were floating in oil. Tried to eat it but it was disgusting.

D C.,"McLean, VA",0,14,,1.0,3/20/2017,"I can't review whether the food is any good, but I'm reviewing the service.  Which is horrible. So bad that they didn't even get around to taking my order. I came in, sat at the bar... and waited.  Waited for a long while before the bartender stopped chatting with someone I can only assume was a friend.  He came by and I ordered some ice tea.  I wanted a menu so I could order some food... but had to ask for that. Then he walked off to resume talking with his friend and never came back. Eventually,  I couldn't tolerate that no one would come and take my order, so I had to get up and flag a passing waiter just to pay for the iced tea before leaving.  (Amazingly, the bartender didn't even notice that I had left to flag down someone for the check.) And as the bartender then, finally, came by with the bill for the iced tea... he was *QUITE* unhappy that I was leaving.

I read that they take call ahead, so we called when we left the house, and the hostess told us that it would be a total of 40 minutes - meaning once we got to the restaurant, we would only have to wait 20 minutes.  For good measure, we waited an additional 10 minutes or so past that time to check in to see where we were on the list, and the answer was basically nowhere close. Another 10 minutes went by, as we talked about our options, as unfortunately we were on a tight schedule. Finally we went up one last time to find out how many people were ahead of us, and they told us that we were only about halfway into our 90 minute wait! Nobody said nothing about no 90 minute wait. We asked to see the manager to share our experience, and he was very apologetic as we told him we were leaving. It was very nice of him to give us a gift card to apologize for our experience, but unfortunately I have no idea how much it is for as nothing was written on it.

This place sucks a**.  I've eaten at BJ's in SoCal many times.  So I was excited to see there were many locations in my home area.  Suffice to say I will NOT be returning.  Brought everyone's drinks at the same time yet my root beer came 20 minutes after everyone else's.  Got my mom's drink order wrong.  Got my queso dip order wrong.  It was supposed to have pork in it and they bring the pork on the side 15 minutes after the fact.  The dip was cold by that point. They also take down your orders electronically at your table.  It takes longer to order your food that way when the waiter doesn't know.  From what I was told, they haven't been open long and that the California reps just left.  Well, they need to come back.  And this location is much smaller than the ones in Cali. Our waiter was not that great.  Just because you're nice doesn't make you a good waiter bring that you're the reason everything was screwed up.

Overall I did enjoy the food but the service was extremely poor.  I know it's a new place but that is when you need to get the new customers to come back.  With so many choices in the area it might be hard for me to come back anytime soon considering all the other reviews are similar to mine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbia?start=60

For my entree, I ordered the chicken bacon on ranch piadina with fries. It was actually pretty delicious. This is a chain, you are not going to get a fine dining experience but for what it is.. it's a decent place.

The staff gave him some bread and water and then after a grueling 20 minutes he finally went to the bathroom. The GM offered to comp us a salad and dessert but I lost my appetite at that point.  The next two visits were not so great. Thankfully no vomit. But the service was pretty terrible. The waiters and waitresses seem busy because they are constantly walking past your table but they rarely stop to check on you.  Just last night my party of 3 had to wait 20 minutes just to have our table cleared of other peoples drinks and then another 10 minutes for someone to even come and take our drink orders.

Rachel R.,"Ellicott City, MD",0,17,,3.0,12/5/2017,"Went here for dinner on Sunday dec 3rd with my boyfriend and a friend. Our server was a little condescending when we were ordering our food. Leaning over one of the chairs at the table and was leaning into the table with his tablet. We ordered root beer and vanilla cream sodas and they weren't as icy as they usually are. And he did not take care of refills at all. I got the California chicken sandwich and asked for cheddar instead of Swiss and it ended up coming with Swiss. Had to call him over and told him it was Swiss and not cheddar and he didn't apologize and just acted awkward like he didn't want to take it back. He stood there holding my plate awkwardly and said ""ummmm okayyyy...."". I'm a server and that's not okay. You're supposed to apologize immediately and offer to take it back and have the Chef make it on the fly. Anyways he came back with it with cheddar and then apologized half heartedly. It was really good so it made the whole experience not so bad. My boyfriend was pretty bad that the root beer soda refills were not taken care of because they are our favorite parts of this restaurant. We asked for a to go soda as well because a previous server(who was absolutely amazing) had done it for us in the past without us even asking, he offered this service. But he was no where to be seen and we wait for 15 minutes and realized he just forgot or didn't care so we left. Luckily the food and the dessert we ordered were amazing! Definitely recommend the ribs, California sandwich, and the monkey bread! Root beer and vanilla cream sodas are to die for! Especially when it's super icy.

The tuna was fresh but there was such minimal seasoning was bland. Our waiter Casey was great! Laid back, great sense of humor and efficient. We both ordered a quinoa bowl but with different proteins on top. There was a lot of shrimp on mine, but base was bland and identical to my husband's meal. What we did like is calories are displayed and the do have numerous, gluten free or low cal options. We may have just chosen wrong meal.

Kenneth W.,"Washington, DC",3,56,11,2.0,4/5/2017,"In a town saturated with pubs and sports bars, I dd not care to see another one. But BJs is new, so I through to give it a try. I visited on a Wednesday evening, the restaurant was sparse.  Upon entering this restaurant, I smell timber rather than food and grease, attesting to newness of this restaurant. The ambience is warm and inviting, and the cavernous ceiling lends a feeling of grandness that says this is no common pub or sports bar. I picked up the menu and struggled to read it because the prints are small, so small that I believe they don't want to understand that I am getting.  But I manage to make out that menu offers many of the stand pub item but also many finer items.  I believe this establishment wants to be classified as fine dining - the prices certainly are. I ordered the Avocado Spring Rolls and the Crispy Calamari to go. The carry out boxes were fancy, and I appreciate that the food was waiting for me inside a warmer rather than just sitting out on a counter. The avocado spring rolls were crispy and full of filling, but they were very salty. Beyond saltiness there were other flavors really.  The accompanying dipping sauce might as well have been sugar water - overly sweet and lacking other flavors. The crispy calamari was cut too thinly for a satisfying bite. The batter had some seasoning, better than most of other place where the batter usually consist of only flour. But the subtle batter was hardly worth mentioning. The accompanying horseradish-tasting dipping sauce didn't go with the calamari. The hostess greeted me pleasantly. The young lady at the register who took my order was also pleasant. I am not sure her remarking my order with, 'That's a good choice!' added any value. If anything, it tells me she's trying too hard. Overall with my fist visit - 2 stars for the food, and 3.5 stars for the briefing interactions with the staff.  I will give this restaurant another try, this time dine-in. Hopefully other items on the menu taste better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbia?start=40

Natalie R.,"Columbia, SC",0,1,,5.0,9/9/2017,"My boyfriend and I went to BJ's tonight for the first time to watch the USC game. We decided to sit at one of the community tables in the bar area. By the time the game started, they were very busy, so we were a little crowded, but since we chose to sit there, it definitely wasn't worth deducting a star.  We started with the Ahi Poke appetizer and we were not fans. The ahi was not how either of us had ever had it before (it was chopped up and totally raw). We did not finish it. We ended up ordering a tavern style pizza, the spicy pig I believe, and it was GREAT! I would highly recommend it. The crust was crispy and cooked very well and the toppings were great. I also had a wedge salad that was good too. I had downloaded the BJ's app beforehand so I had a coupon for a free mini pizookie and which was also wonderful. Fresh baked chocolate chip cookie with ice cream on top is hard to beat.  We stayed for the entire game, so almost 4 hours and our waitress was very attentive the entire time. They had a ton of waiters tonight, it seemed like many of them were in training, so you could always find someone if you needed anything.  We will definitely be going back to BJ's.

When the root beer hits the table it's icy cold and frothy. And on 2 of our 3 additional visits the servers and host/hostesses have been extremely friendly and helpful! One (Cara?) went out of her way to assist us with our leftovers and take home items.  I'm reducing my initial review from 5 to 4 stars for 2 reasons: 1. I ordered a chicken club without avocado. The server repeated our order back to us but the sandwich came with smashed up avocado which I couldn't just scrape off. Server didn't come back to check on us right away so I ate the dry chicken. When she finally comes over she tells me that she didn't hear me request no avocado and to make it better she offered another sandwich - the meal was over and I was no longer hungry. No other solution was offered (reduced bill, free dessert, etc).   2. On another visit, the floor around our table wasn't clean. Our server was very apologetic and extremely kind; she took care of it right away.  Original Review (5 stars) This is a perfect location as all of the other restaurants in this shopping center are all less than desirable. The hostess was very friendly as she showed us to our seat. Our server Aria ROCKED. She was friendly, patient (as we had questions about the new menu, specials, and beer selection) and just awesome. Our food was delish and the drinks were frothy and cold.

Jason F.,"Ellicott City, MD",30,228,,4.0,3/6/2017,"First time at a BJ's and I would describe it as a Cheesecake Factory with pizza and beer. Good for what it is. If you are expecting fine dining or authentic food, then you will be surely disappointed.  Ordered the sweet pig pizza, side of fries, and a chocolate chip pizookie. The pizza is a deep dish/pan pizza. I equate it similar to Domino's version of the pan pizza which sounds insulting, but I liked it since Hawaiian style pizzas are my favorite and the crust was nice and fluffy. The fries were supposed to be shoe string, but apparently this location does not have those so they were just regular. Tasted fine at least. The dessert was good. Think chocolate chip cookie cake with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream.  Tried 2 of their beers. The goliath and the porter. Respectable offerings. They have plenty of taps and not just their own beers. Also, plenty of liquor options.  If you set your expectations right, this place is nice for a casual meal. The restaurant looks nice, has plenty of TVs, and the service was friendly.

Conner D.,"Columbia, MD",0,2,,2.0,9/3/2017,"On what is now my fifth time dinning here I feel that I'm finally ready to post a review. Every time I go here I tell myself that I'll review it next time, give it one more chance. And every time I'm more and more disappointed. My first time going to Bjs our waitress took way to long to get any of our orders. My moms wine came out much much much later than everyone else's. And here's my biggest problem with the restaurant: the service. My cousin asked for a bottle of ketchup l for his burger form the waiter that brought our food out (he was a different person than the one that served us, keep that in mind it's important for later). The one who brought the food out never came back and our server didn't have any ketchup with him. Neither of them returned, and my cousin ended up having to ask another table for one.  The food itself isn't that bad (the boneless wings are about 80% breading it seems, and the pork chop was too sweet for my liking). The pulled pork is pretty good, but overall not the best. The atmosphere is the only real selling point for me now; plenty of screens and the open concept is great, it's just unfortunate that the food can't match the ambiance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbia?start=40

Deborah L.,"Ellicott City, MD",140,16,29,2.0,4/24/2017,"Let me make things clear before I state my opinions about this place: I came here TWICE to see if the first time was a false representation of this place. 1.) The atmosphere is nice. Open space, modern & good place to catch a drink.  2.) The food is good, and that's why I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1.  3.) The servers here S-U-C-K.  the first time I came here, a short haired black girl served us. She was low-key snarky, SLOW and entitled. Utensils were not given until we asked for it. Never came around to check on us. Moved sluggishly. Made me feel like a burden. All around had a difficult persona/vibe she was giving off that was half weird/half rude. I understand people have bad days, but at LEAST be a little cordial when that's your job to do so? Just a LITTLE.  4.) Second time around, we got a male server (I forgot how he looked like). Same problems again...RUDE and unenthusiastic. Utensils had to be asked for again, drinks took forever to come out. I heard the table next to us complaining and looking disappointed as well that drinks took forever to come out. Didn't really check up on us- sincerely. Just kinda unenthusiastically strolled on by. By the end of the dinner, then enthusiastically said, ""have a great weekend!"" Probably to make a great impression for tip. But you're not fooling me sir.  All in all, servers here 'get the job done' on the surface but are just so rude and a buzzkill to be around. I don't get it. I almost felt like we were a burden put on them.  In all fairness, I really don't think I'm one of those a-hole customers. Service here just sucks. Such a shame.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbia?start=40

They have lots of beers on tap, some local as well as several crafted sodas - root beer, orange, cream and black cherry.  You can get any of those for a refill so try a couple.  I had the orange and then the cream - both were very good.  The dessert - their pizooki was excellent.  They have specials - pizza night or burger night are 2 of them.  The only thing I didn't like was my pet peeve of the entree coming out before we had time to finish our appetizer.  We had only eaten about half before the meal came.

The menu states the steaks are high quality and aged, then why bury them in so much pepper and season that it just becomes a plate for the pepper! Then to top it off, mid-rare came out cold and red throughout. It took 10 minutes for server to check and when I told her she said they would fix it. I asked if they could not bury it in seasoning. After 24 minutes it came back dry and cooked very uneven and still buried in pepper. Nothing said or asked by the server. The salmon my friend ordered had so much salt it didn't even taste like salmon! The next visit from the server was the check drop off! I called the next day and the day after to speak with a manager but it took 5 days for a response! I will try again but i don't have high hopes!

She never once cleared our empty plates after appetizers or entrees our drink glasses were never once refilled by our server we had to ask other servers to fill them. Our server disappeared on several instances for about 10-15 min and the other servers were trying to take care of us.The manager I believe his name was Steve came to our table after another server recognized our frustration, he listened to our complaint and did nothing about it except say he was going to check on our dessert and never returned to fix the problem.

Athena B.,"Millersville, MD",68,126,57,4.0,12/14/2017,"Came here for work holiday lunch and had great service. I believe our waitress' name was Natasha, and she was very attentive and friendly. There was another lady who came out to bring our food, and one of the guests in our party ordered a steak and when she handed him his food, she asked if he could cut a piece of his steak to ensure it was cooked to his liking. I've never seen a restaurant staff member ask a question like that, and I love that she did! They definitely went above and beyond and for the service and quality of food, they get 5 stars!! The 4 stars is only because of the seating they have for large parties. It may have been because there was a really large party (looked like 15 people) taking up all the tables where I guess they could accommodate larger parties, but we only had 5 people and they crammed us in a booth that was really meant for 4 adults. Most big restaurants like this tend to have those semi-circle booths for larger parties, but they don't have that here. All tables seem to fit only 4 people, unless they put tables together (which that other party took all of). So I just wish they could accommodate larger parties better (being that we weren't even much of a large party and felt crammed), but other than that, this place is great!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbia

Gregory B.,"Capitol Heights, MD",137,208,166,5.0,10/16/2017,"Great Restaurant but Need Reimbursement for Socks Intro/Atmosphere:  My fit friend told me about BJ's and raved about the pizookie.  I knew if she would spend her calories on some junk it had to be worth it.  So, I wasted no time in going to this place the very same day. I really like the atmosphere of BJ's.  There's a bit of a sports theme, but it serves well as a family restaurant.  It has a vast American menu that can accommodate everyone. Food:  I'm not a burger guy, but I got the hickory brisket and bacon burger with fries.  The flavors were absolutely great.  The hickory mixed with the bacon hit the spot and the bread was just flawless.   I followed it up with a monkey bread pizookie.  You know... (serious moment) it's very rare that you find something that actually supersedes expectation these days.  I came here expecting this pizookie to be excellent and it still managed to blow my socks off.  Seriously, has anyone seen my socks?  It was sooo good.  The soft, warm, and flavorful monkey bread combined with that vanilla ice cream was immaculate.  And it was only $3!!!  I'm glad there is no BJ's close to me because I would be a sad, obese, sock-less man messing around with these pizookies.   Customer Service:  The customer service was outstanding.  My server was pleasant.  My food came fast.  My server went the extra mile because my phone died and I needed directions on how to go to Autobahn raceway.  She looked up the directions and wrote them out by hand for me.  I wish I remembered her name. She's the real MVP. Conclusion:  It's rare that a chain restaurant can earn 5 stars, but I love everything about BJ's.  I eyeballed a lot of people's plates and all of the food looks good.  Anytime I'm in the neighborhood, I'll make it a point to visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbia

I ordered a Great White, which has grilled chicken breast, alfredo sauce, mushrooms, roasted garlic, Parmesan cheese, and seasoned tomatoes. I'm not a fan of chicken so I swapped it out for applewood smoked bacon. Sometimes they charge you for this, even though it would seem it is an even swap, and sometimes they don't. I also added black olives and a pesto drizzle. It is a huge pizza but I had leftovers for several days, which I love leftovers so I don't mine. Reheats great in the oven.  So many great choices!

In the shopping center where Target is located, BJs isn't hard to find. Friendly servers, just not enough. The menu is extensive and can be overwhelming. They have tons of options which can make it hard to choose. Healthy options always make me smile.  I ordered a strawberry lemonade, very refreshing.

Ericka G.,"Columbia, MD",262,419,1625,2.0,3/22/2017,"This was my first visit to the Columbia location as I had previously visited Laurel and one in Orange County California.  Upon entry, I was greeted by a very handsome tall gentleman with dark hair. He walked me to my table. He was very genuine, gave great eye contact, was engaging.... I wish I caught his name. As simple as that interaction was, in business, you'll go far.  My server Sierra S, later approaches and takes my order. Sierra, I noticed is rushed with me. Her interaction, very odd.... she however is undivided & engaging to the point of inappropriateness with the table of 4 aged men to my left. My service was more an after thought and distracted.  My Orange cream soda arrives sans a straw. I don't mention it as I was curious as to how vigilant my serve would prove to be. I additionally ordered the ahi poke. The wonton chips were overcooked, very close to being burnt. The dish although plated was flavorless. No salt, no soy ginger. No lime. Probably the worst I've ever had. I said nothing. It was clear my chips were burnt and were not in a state that should be served... the line cook served then anyway, the delivery server, served them anyway, even my server saw them, said nothing. That tells you the level of respect they have of the food they serve and to whom....  I also order the tomato bisque in the sourdough bread bowl. The bowl is overcooked. The bowl was not gutted properly so, its bowl only contained maybe 2-3 oz of the soup. The rest being the bread that they were too lazy to pull.  As I'm eating my soup, (it's about 9:30p, they close at midnight). I'm rushed into deciding if I want a dessert and choosing one. Prior to this, my receipt was already placed at my table. I was pretty much shoved out the door from the second I sit down. I refuse dessert as the sizes are too big. I'd prefer the option of purchasing on mini dessert instead of a trio. The check... I don't touch the check until I'm completely finished with my meal. I hadn't seen it at this point. She notices from afar that she did not swipe my card properly and charged me some obscure amount. It takes some time to get the manager to adjust the charge. She then tells me I could leave and they would correct the charge at the end of the night. My server has proven to be less than vigilant and so thus too was not a surprise..... I informed her I paid with a Corporate AmEX and that I'd need a receipt. I am not given a receipt to show that the obscure amount was corrected and credited back, solely that I was now being charged correctly. The manager never came over to speak to me, even as I passed him when I left.  It's funny because I sat there in pulled back hair, a low bun, designer business attire, designer purse and paid with a corporate card and my less than bright server still gave subpar service. This restaurant just opened. I could be a mystery shopper. She was more concerned with the group of flirty elderly gentlemen to my left than ensuring my meal was up to a standard.  I will say, the same young man that walked me to my table gave me the kindest greeting again upon departure. I let him know to look out for my review. I'm not sure who this man is, but he needs a raise and a promotion. You either have it or you don't. He does. Sierra S, doesn't.  Would I come back? They need to get their ish together. If you want me to train your team, I will. Kitchen staff & servers.... How in the world you'd serve that meal to me is beyond fathomable. And I purposely said nothing to prove how incompetent they were... that, and on that level they'd spit in my food. I didn't want that either.

Kat A.,"Washington, DC",30,231,16,4.0,8/11/2017,"This might sound weird but I have never heard of this place despite their multitude of locations...which I learned about after eating here for the first time this past week. Overall their menu and offerings are probably my favorite aspect when you compare them to their competitors.  For example, they have the usuals when it comes to apps but they also have unique offerings like avocado egg rolls and crispy flatbread nachos. They're not generic in the sense one might expect. We started with the asparagus and artichokes (I wanted the egg rolls but was overruled) and they were delicious. The asparagus was a bit stringy so I'm not sure if I'd order that again but the artichokes were a awesome.  I tried their BJ's Classic deep dish pizza as my entree and was surprised. It was much better than I anticipated. Plus they also have a bunch of sizes (not the norm when it comes to deep dish pizza) so I really liked that aspect. The pizza didn't take an hour like traditional Chicago deep dish which I was totally fine with. They also have an option of a half half deep dish speciality pizza which got them extra points in my pizza book, even if I didn't order it. It's a great option if you're ordering a larger sized deep dish and sharing it with a table of people who don't agree on pizza toppings.  Sorry for the pizza rambling. Really enjoyed the food and will be back for sure!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbia
