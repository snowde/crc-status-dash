Arun P.,"Dallas, TX",116,147,358,4.0,11/11/2017,"This was a business lunch so service had to be quick.  Well, we were impressed inspite of the restaurant being super busy. Drinks : We tried their cream sodas and they were great.  Feel free to ask for different flavors for a refill. Food : Their menu is a huge book :)  You can pretty much find anything you want to eat.  I tried the clam chowder and it was really good.  For entrees I tried the ham sandwich with fries.  Our table ordered sandwiches to seafood plates and everyone enjoyed their food. Service : Friendly service and our waitress was very efficient and attentive. Ambience : Its in a huge mall with tons of parking.  The restaurant has a casual ambience and is generally crowded during lunch and dinner.  Price : Moderately priced.  There are some expensive dishes on the menu too. Will I return : Absolutely!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbus-2
Rachel S.,"Westerville, OH",81,3,,2.0,11/2/2017,"Food is good and consistent. Americana type fare. However, I have ordered take out from here twice. Both times I have ordered ahead by at least 20 minutes, and then once arrived, left waiting a half hour longer. I would be disappointed in eat-in service that took 50 minutes from order to delivery, let alone carry out.  No apology or recognition of a long wait.  The parking lot at this location is not sufficient, so be prepared to circle for awhile.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbus-2
Laura L.,"Westerville, OH",43,165,138,5.0,10/24/2017,"I have eaten both here at the Easton location and at the Polaris location and I have had great food and service each time. Today, I had lunch with a team from work, and everyone raved about how delicious their meals were. Although I don't review chains very often, I decided to write this review today because I thought my lunch was especially good. Before we left work to go to BJ's, I looked over the menu online. I was very pleased to see that they include the calories for each item. I looked over the menu carefully... everything sounded delicious, but there were a lot of dishes very high in calories. Fortunately, I also found several things in the 500-600 calorie range (and some even lower) that sounded delicious, too. I settled on the fire-roasted barbacoa chicken. This meal was off-the-charts delicious. The menu describes it this way: A barbacoa-spiced, marinated chicken breast served over brown rice and black beans, then topped with feta cheese, cilantro, crema and fire-roasted tomato salsa. (I saw on one version of the menu that the crema is made with Greek yogurt.) [520 calories] Everything in the dish was delicious, but the chicken especially stood out. It was so moist and tender, my fork cut through it like softened butter, and it was seasoned perfectly. I most definitely did not feel like I was skimping or missing out any by getting something with fewer calories. As I mentioned, everyone on my team was raving about how delicious their meals were, so I'm pretty certain five stars was the consensus, and many of them had also gotten lower calorie meals. Thanks, BJ's for offering such delicious options for those of us who want something with fewer calories and putting so much effort into making those options so delicious!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbus-2
Rory A.,"Powell, OH",1,5,18,1.0,1/2/2018,This place sucks! Ordered a kale brussel sprout salad and it came to us without the brussel sprouts! They brought some out on the side after waiting a few minutes topped with burnt plastic!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbus-2
Mike B.,"Reynoldsburg, OH",1,14,9,4.0,12/30/2017,"First time eating here.  When we arrived, they were packed, but made room for us faster than I expected.  The staff was very friendly and attentive, without being bothersome.  Refills cane fast, and checked about food satisfaction.   I got the fresh tomato and mozzarella salad and the spinach and artichoke dip.  Both were very good.  A good portion of dip, and the salad was very fresh.   For an entree I got the pulled pork and fried onion sandwich.  It was very full of flavor, and the sauce was tangy and good.  Would recommend everything I got as solid options.  Fries were crisp and good.  Portion was more than ample.   All in all, a great dining experience.  I'll be back again next time I'm in the area and want great food and tonight notch service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbus-2

Amy D.,"Lakewood, OH",114,72,179,2.0,5/7/2017,"I'm not in the habit of frequenting chain restaurants, but alas, sometimes it just is what it is.  I joined a group of colleagues here while visiting Columbus for a work-related trip. I didn't chose the restaurant, and probably wouldn't have based on the previous reviews. But my company was excellent so that made up for the sub-par food and sad service. To start, I joined a table of 5 other people, who had already ordered drinks and were snacking on guacamole and tortilla chips. Within a few minutes the server arrived, acknowledged my presence and offered to take my drink order. I placed my order and rejoined my friends in conversation. The server returned with the salads everyone had ordered before I arrived, but not my drinks. I asked her about them & she looked a little embarrassed and said the bar was backed up. She did return with my drink(s) a few minutes later and offered to replenish our tortilla chips, on the house. That's typically a good sign of customer service, in my experience.  One of my colleagues ordered an appetizer, some sort of southwestern tex-mex flatbread. It was actually pretty yummy and we all munched on it while waiting for our food. Perplexed by the 6428492 page menu, I ordered the sirloin to keep things simple. I should have headed the yelp! reviews ahead of me. The sirloin was about 6 ounces, and coated in some sort of seasoning that resembled Mrs. Dash. I honestly have no idea why one would feel the need to season a steak in this way. It's steak, it's supposed to be naturally delicious. No. Not this steak. It sat in my stomach all night like the dead cow that it was. It kept me up all night, refusing to digest. Oh, what an unhappy meal this was. The asparagus was equally over-seasoned, and the only saving grace where the white cheddar potatoes, which were obviously from some sort of prepared package, but tasty nonetheless. Now onto the sad service. I honestly felt so terrible for our poor, young server. She was so incredibly sweet, and tried her hardest to care for our needs, but she or the restaurant in general kept coming up short. Our food came out in waves, instead of altogether. My friend never got a salad she ordered at the same time as everyone else. My other friend never received a beer she ordered. I had to ask several times for a second glass of wine. When the checks came, my friend who ordered 2 double vodka soda's found that she was charged for 4 separate drinks at $8/piece. $32 for two drinks. After discussing it with her manager the server managed to get that corrected and instead the drinks were $10/piece.  All in all, there are many other restaurants in Columbus. Why chose this one?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbus-2
Heather R.,"New Albany, OH",59,18,5,3.0,12/23/2017,"We decided to go here for a few drinks and apps. Ended up ordering the appetizer sampler, and a couple margaritas.

Summer C.,"Reynoldsburg, OH",0,32,,1.0,11/13/2017,"I came here with two other people on a Friday night. We knew It would be busy so we used the online check-in service. The wait was an hour from the point we checked in. We arrived close to the end of that hour and we checked to see if our name was close to being called, It was not, we were told. So we waited with about 40 other people (no exaggeration) in the standing room only waiting area. After 40 more minutes I checked again to see if we were close to being called. The hostess looked confused and couldn't even find our name, and then told us it'd be another 40-50 minutes! We ended up leaving. So unfortunately, I can only give 1 star for this very disappointing experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbus-2

Adam R.,"Toledo, OH",180,102,125,2.0,1/16/2017,"I made the mistake of ordering steak. I know it was a bad decision, but I love steak and my wife doesn't eat beef, so I eat it any chance I get. Plus, my in-laws were paying. I order my steak medium rare and it had a lot of char on the outside. That kind of summed up the experience. We ordered the avacado egg rolls as an appetizer for the table. They were kind of mushy and bland. With seven people at the table, we had to pressure people to finish the one order. The service was unnoticeable, neither in a good way no a bad. The wait for a table was long two days after Christmas at a major shopping center. The bathroom had more pictures of Marilyn Monroe than you'd expect. If you're looking for a chain, there are plenty of better choices. If you're looking for something more memorable, there are even better ones. If you're stuck in the area, walk across the parking lot to Chevy's. If somebody insists on going, okay, fin, whatever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbus-2
Heather S.,"Columbus, OH",49,191,59,3.0,1/11/2017,"I've been here a few times and realized I've never left a review. We recently went with another couple to catch dinner just after Christmas. The wait time was quoted to be around 25mins or so. There was a mix up in our seating and we waited for about 1.5hrs to get seated. We had requested a table vs. a booth, but there was plenty of opportunity to seat us before we hit 1.5hrs. They do come around with samples of pizza a couple times which was a nice gesture, but getting seated would have been better. Things happen, I know, but the fact that no one seemed to care that we were waiting that long is what was upsetting. An apology, a comp appetizer, or let us know that the tables at the bar were up for grabs! Cause others came in and just took those over.  Anyways, the food is always solid. Nothing fancy or pretentious, just good. They brew their own beers and sodas and that's really their big plus.  Would I go back? Probably, but certainly not on my top 50 list in Columbus.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbus-2

Tried the Hickory Brisket not bad but don't eat much red meat so feeling heavy on my belly. Other than that it was still delicious. Next time I think I'll try the Cherry Chipotle Salmon.  For dessert we got the sample cookie. The Oreo and cream was AMAZING. Definitely unexpectedly delicious! I also got the Strawberry Beignet to go. Looking forward to that later.

Carlos S.,"Brampton, Canada",21,248,215,2.0,4/28/2016,"A chain restaurant across from Whole Foods. It was clean, modern, and the host was attentive and polite. They make their own beers and have a huge selection. The menu is huge too which seemed like the quality would suffer. I ordered their in house Tatonka stout which is one of their darker beers. For my meal I had Avocado egg rolls for an app and the portobello burger for dinner. You can get it with a meat patty, 2 portobello caps, with a veggie patty, or combination. The Avocado egg rolls were very tasty, filling, and super hot. However, the burger was very bad. The mushroom cap was to big and watery which made the bread soggy.

Stacy R.,"Reynoldsburg, OH",32,3,,1.0,9/20/2017,"Went here for a after work happy hour.  Food was good, when we finally received it.  They were short handed, but it felt like they totally forgot our group of 12.  There were no apologies or manger that came by to check on us, until one of our party members went to tell the manager.  Checking out was a disaster,  we still had to wait forever.  Manager gave us a coupon for the next visit, but you still had to spend $9.95 to get the free item.  Our group recover customers for a living, so we really tried to be empathic with the staff.  After the way our situation was handled we will not be back.  This was my first and last time visiting BJ's",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbus-2?start=20
John R.,"Groveport, OH",4,23,10,2.0,7/11/2016,"I've been here before, and was not impressed then either. We had a coupon so we thought we would try it again. I ordered the Lemon Thyme Chicken, which, on the menu picture looked very appetizing (attached). Looked like a nice grilled piece of chicken with a dry rub of sorts, Brussels sprouts, onions, and other veggies around it that look to be sautéed. The rice in the picture was also what appears to be white and dry (dry meaning no added sauces), with the food sitting atop. What I was served was completely different, it was a disgusting mass of soaked rice in what I can only describe as an oil bath. I took a close up of the food where I had cleared a small patch of the plate so you can see the oil running out of the rice/sauce, it's that yellow sheen there (also attached). Every grain of rice was COMPLETELY drenched in this oily sauce. It was heavy, and very unappetizing to look at. Very opposite of the ""Light"" dish it is on the menu as. Just my food in of itself deserved only 1 star (heck zero stars). But, saving one extra star was the cook on the chicken, as well as the staff. Chicken was cooked through, hot, and juicy. In addition, my wife's food was rather tasty, which I finished, since I did not eat anything but the chicken from mine (after scraping off the oily mess that it was soaked in). The staff was attentive, friendly, and the waiter was efficient with our order, refills and the check. The flavor was there, and this dish could be really good if it was as pictured, with a light amount of sauce atop a bed of fluffy white (DRY) rice (even brown rice would be a healthier alternative here, and might even get the dish below 500 calories if used instead). Instead it was as if they sautéed the veggies AND the chicken in the same pan with a TON of oil, and then just dumped ALL of it on the plate, rather than picking the veggies out of the sauce and leaving the excess sauce in the pan, which would have been ideal here.  After 2 strikes, I will likely need another coupon to come back to BJ's again, when that happens, hopefully they don't strike out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbus-2?start=20
John M.,"Northland, Columbus, OH",106,201,1359,4.0,9/9/2015,"I really wish they put that much effort into the food as they do the decor up in BJ's. It's like their trying to be something their not.  FYI, if a restaurant ever has a book with a bizzllion items, chances are the food isn't as great. Great beer selection, I had a very nice waitress, had a nice time with family there but the food is over priced for what it is. It's like the food is good enough to be kinda fancy but not great enough to justify the price. Don't get me wrong my Jambalaya was good. The house salad was half a bowl.

My medium rare steak was very rare, and it and it's paired side were very cool because of waiting for the unordered side. Also, their dessert menu is pretty singularly focused on their pizzookie. However, they only had 2 of their 6 or so varieties available because they ran out of the others and ran out of vanilla ice cream to go with it.

Emily S.,"Athens, OH",0,7,1,1.0,12/8/2016,"This place is terrible. Don't waste your time. First, we showed up at 6 and asked how long the wait would be for a table of 4. We were told 40-50 minutes and so we agreed to wait. An hour later and with no table, I asked the host who told me THIRTEEN parties were ahead of us. When I pressed him why our estimated wait time was so off, he said something about call-aheads (what's the point of a wait time estimate if call-aheads are that much of a problem?!) He assured me we'd be seated soon. We commiserated with others waiting, who had all been told 30-50 minute wait times and now had been waiting for an hour or more.  After a 2 hour wait we were called. But THEN we were told that our table wasn't ready. They had accidentally given it to someone else. Cue more waiting. 2 hours and 15 minutes later, we were finally seated. Unfortunately there was no silverware or anything else at our table. More waiting.  When we finally ordered, they got our order wrong (my medium rare stake came well done...). The rest of our food was mediocre at best.  The apologies from the wait staff and manager were full of excuses and no one would take responsibility.  All told, after arriving at 6pm we left at 9:30!!! 3.5 hours later - and only about 20 minutes of that was spent actually eating. Horrible service, only ok food - this place is a waste of everyone's time and money. EDIT: I don't know how to respond to the manger who commented below, but I would be more than happy to provide more info about our experience if you message me.

Things out of his control was the quality of food and how it was repaired. I ordered BJ's Rib-Eye, the other two in our party ordered the Rib-Eye as well and the Lemon Thyme Chicken. My steak did not come out at the same time as the other orders did. I was told that my steak was over cooked? Asked for Medium? The other steak at our table was also medium, so how was it that my steak was over cooked? By the time my steak came the other two were finished with there plates.  My friend Rib-Eye looked awesome thick n juicy cooked medium slightly red inside and he said it was good. The Lemon Chicken, the chicken was cooked fine but the garnish was over cooked and the Brussel sprouts were all burned.  So my steak comes? was it a Rib-Eye? Not sure? It was only 1/2'' thick with 3/4 of it fate and gristle. The meat part was rare as if it had been seared on both side, well one side because when I looked and the underside it was still bleeding.... My asparagus was dry and over cooked, mashed potatoes were good just a very small portion. For $21.95 I would expect an eatable dinner plate to be served? No, am I wrong in expecting this? I can't and will not complain about our waiter he was very apologetic and tried his best to take care of things. The quality of food and how it is cooked was out of his control.

Their prices are spot on; just the right price for the portion and quality. One person at our table got the salmon over quinoa, and another got the mahi-mahi pineapple dish and they both raved about how tender and delicious their fish was (especially for a chain restaurant like this, we were amazed!). Pizzas: They list their pizzas as ""deep-dish,"" but this is really not true. BJ's pizzas are just SERVED in a deep dish, but they are actually pan pizzas. Real deep-dish has a thick crust with lots of sauce and toppings. BJ's pizzas are very light, buttery, flaky crust (i.e. pan pizza) with very little sauce. They did pile on the toppings, which I loved. So was expecting deep-dish, got pan pizza instead. Still awesome tasting, and will definitely get it again! Try the BJ's favorite or Gourmet Five Meat. Beer: Every single beer they brew is delicious. You can get pints, pitchers, or samplers of any beer on tap.

I would compare it to The Cheesecake Factory -- but with a better beer selection.  Like most chains....their menu caters to all different types of customers. It takes little risk and focuses on creating selections which are neither groundbreaking nor spectacular. This style of food service is not always a bad thing, however it does leave something to be desired by food connoisseur's seeking a revolutionary experience.  The service was great/cheerful and the ambiance is exactly what you should expect from a chain brewhouse. Overall, it is a good family or group destination for people who require many options.

Stephanie P.,"Dublin, OH",53,284,35,4.0,6/30/2015,"The Boy and I wandered in here last week after seeing that it had just opened. The place still had that ""new construction"" smell. There was a large number of staff floating around, probably due to trainers still onsite for the opening. This worked in our favor as everything was smooth as silk. We were seated as soon as we walked in, I expect this won't be possible again once word gets out that they are open. If you've been to a BJ's before, you're already familiar with the layout and menu. I opted for their seasonal beer (which was darn tasty) and the boy went for the blonde ale. We both went for new menu items. I tried the barbacoa chicken off the enLIGHTened menu. It is very good, nicely spiced and cooked perfectly. The Boy had the bbq brisket burger which looked amazing and he reports that it was very tasty. Our server (who, like most of the staff, was new) was prompt, polite and helpful.  They have a takeout door/counter, which seems like an excellent idea for the Easton area.

Matt P.,"Columbus, OH",54,201,497,4.0,6/28/2015,"Even thought this place just opened I didn't have any rookie issues with anyone. Seems to be running pretty smooth. It's located in the new Easton Gateway complex and has its own parking lot. It's pretty much the same as the Polaris location but maybe a little less space.  Regardless, I decided to try something off their enLIGHTened menu this time. Specifically the Kale and Roasted Brussels Sprouts Salad, but with added Cajun Shrimp. I'd suggest just asking for shrimp without seasoning. Perhaps for everything you get it added to. Something was a little off with all the flavors of the salad and I think it might have been that Cajun seasoning. Overall it was nice. Worth a try if you're into the whole kale trend and dig roasted brussels sprouts. Neither was overly bitter. Can't visit a BJ's without getting a beer, which they brew themselves, but not on location. I love their Hefeweizen-crisp taste but also a great aroma. I love just sitting there and smelling it. All locations also have seasonals throughout the year, like Pumpkin Ale and others for Oktoberfest and the winter months. They also have a gluten free berry cider as well. It's pretty refreshing and not as sweet as most. This ties in to their gluten free menu, which isn't that extensive but good that they have those options. I'm NOT Gluten free, mind you, but that salad I had was on that menu.  Definitely worth checking out one of their locations. Extensive food and drink menu that would be hard to not find something to enjoy. UPDATE: went back for dinner and got the ahi tuna salad and the sriracha brussels sprouts appetizer together. Also a pint of local CBC Summer Teeth beer. The salad was very good but the size of the tuna in the photo was definitely NOT what I got. A little bait and switch I feel. Also, it had small wasabi dollops in it, which I kept hitting and freaking out about. Needs to be mixed in better. WOW! Brussels sprouts were once again very good but you get a lot of them.

Shortly after our party of 4 was seated we did drink orders and food orders. Then they sat a table of 16-20 in the same section and things went kind of south from there. I ordered boneless wings and tortilla soup. First cup of soup **barely** Luke warm and the cheese wasn't even melted. Second **comped** bowl of soup... same temp. Boneless wings verging cool temp. Another bowl of chili in our party served cold. After apologizing again and again, I told the server never mind on the soup. (Again, our server was great and did the best he could!). Manager comes by with lucky Tortilla soup #3 in an effort to make amends I suppose, but at this point I'd moved on... I would have liked to have seen the manager more involved. If you're going to over run your server, you could at least help out. Also to note, this was a Friday night about 11:30pm. The restaurant wasn't that busy even after the table of 16-20 was seated.

Like put your order in and wait 20 minutes to get your drinks and 45 mins to get your appetizer slow. Dinner finally arrived after over an hour. All in all took about 2 hours. Thankfully we had no other plans. I think our server was new to serving.  We didn't see her much but she was nice when we did. Not helpful but nice. The food was okay and portions were good.

For starters, I arrived at 7:30 PM and my order wasn't taken until 9:30 PM. Yes, I understand that it was a Friday night and yes I understand that it's in Easton which is a very popular part of town. But I also feel like the establishment should know that. And they should have more than enough people scheduled to work to accommodate the crowd. If you have more people working, people are seated quicker. Those same people then order faster and they eat faster and leave quicker. For me, it all boils down to being prepared. The drinks were ordered and there was a root beer that was placed on the table with absolutely no ice at all. Just root beer and a glass. I sampled a little bit of everyone's plate including the chicken tenders and fries, the fish and french fries, the brisket barbecue burger and my dish which was the baked ziti. The ziti was not cooked al dente. It tasted like it was rinsed in hot water and placed in the broiler. The top level of my pasta was crunchy. Pasta is never supposed to be crunchy. It tasted like someone had gotten some noodles,  poured some Ragu on it, sprinkled some cheese on top and brought it out. And to think they have the audacity to charge me $15 for this. Our server only came to check on us for drinks when we were about to leave so at that point there was no need. Now I understand that everyone has a bad day sometimes. Evidently I caught them on their's. But sometimes once is all it takes for me, especially when there is so many other similar themed restaurants for people to choose from.

The dish itself tasted...okay...the sauce had good flavor...the olives and the tomatoes were pretty tasty.  We asked for the check and paid our bill without complaining to the waiter.

They don't skimp on toppings either. The last time I went I got their balsamic glazed chicken. Oh my gosh it was so good! It was perfectly seasoned chicken breast over greens with crunchy onions on top, along with some really tasty mashed potatoes. I enjoyed every bite.  They brew their own beer too and it does not disappoint. Also their pizookies are so yummy. They are a perfectly done cookie with ice cream on top. Yum!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbus-2?start=60
Andrew A.,"Cranberry Township, PA",0,4,,5.0,1/3/2016,"One of my favourite places to go in columbus. Pizza and all other food is amazing as well as the beer selection. Service is hit or miss but never bad enough to warrant a poor review. If you have not tried it, bump the top spot on your to do list.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbus-2?start=60
Denae D.,"Columbus, OH",13,14,,5.0,10/7/2015,"Half price wine Tuesdays and an amazing menu. The ""light"" menu options are fantastic and truly delicious.

Dan S.,"Mason, OH",20,31,,3.0,6/19/2016,"My sister was in the Columbus area this weekend, so we brought my dad here so the whole family could have lunch together on Father's Day.  This place was decent.  I'm trying to eat healthier, so I ordered the Mediterranean chicken tacos.  They were decent, although the chicken was a little on the dry side.  It came with a side of an orzo/rice type mix that was very cold....I wasn't expecting that, but it is supposed to be served that way.  It was very tasty and had a surprisingly sweet taste that I enjoyed a lot.  Also had a few bites of Pizookie, which was of course incredible.  Our server was very friendly, but could have been a little more prompt removing dirty dishes from the table after we were finished eating.  He had already been back twice to refill drinks and get our drink orders, so it would have been nice if he took a dish or two back.  Oh well, not that big of a deal.  Overall it was pretty good for a chain restaurant.  I probably won't be back to this particular location any time soon, but would have no issue visiting the one in Cincinnati.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbus-2?start=80
Elizabeth B.,"Henderson, NV",6,66,334,3.0,7/28/2015,it was good i had a salad .. the shrimp scampi looked good ..and the kids mini corn dogs she liked but not the rice lol ...the dessert was great ... the bathrooms where pretty much spotless i loved that cuz to me if the bathrooms are gross it turns me off to the whole place ...the girls that met you when u walk in where very friendly very pleasant over all it was a nice place id come back again if in the area,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbus-2?start=80
Spencer B.,"Granville, OH",12,3,,1.0,8/23/2015,"If you don't want to drink their beer don't go here. When we didn't order beer our waitress no longer was interested in serving our table. She never checked on us and our food order was wrong when we finally got it. Other tables around us that ordered beers had EXCEPTIONALLY better service. Will never go to BJ's again, food was just bad and missing items that it said it came with on the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbus-2?start=80
Sherry C.,"Columbus, OH",0,2,,3.0,5/5/2016,"I expected a great dinner tonight but I was terribly disappointed.  We sat at the bar which usually results in better service. I ordered a salad and then discovered there was no chicken on my salad.  The bartender then took my salad to the kitchen and then she returned--no salad and no explanation. Eventually I was told they were making me a new salad. The salad was delivered with no apology, but my fork was on the salad that was in the kitchen. After 5 min, I got a fork. Hubby's meal was good but not as good as normal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbus-2?start=80
Brendan B.,"Milton, FL",0,21,3,2.0,5/28/2016,Below average. Steak came out too well done but was promptly returned for a better cut. Waitress spilled drink when pouring. Food quality was mediocre.

Phil V.,"Westerville, OH",100,10,3,4.0,8/15/2015,"Great root beer on tap! Love the mahi tacos!

They claim ""we're a family restaurant"" ok, then have them sit in a booth, away from the bar. Bar stools are not high chairs. Then the family I had a problem with, with their child climbing the barstool every five minutes...started f-you and f-you because I had a problem with it....awesome parents!!!! bartender sided with them..as the loser parents announced, ""we're in here 3-4 times a week"" way to go, parents of the year!!!

T W.,"Attleboro, MA",0,23,,1.0,11/22/2015,"Nice atmosphere, good looking menu...and 1 hour and 15 minutes later we walked out the door without knowing how the food was. Got seated immediately, waited a while for a waitress but figured it was just a bad start. No problem. 10 minutes after being seated we finally had an ice tea/water in front of us and placed food order. Fast forward 15 minutes...tea and water refills but no food. Slow forward another 45 minutes and we hadn't seen waitress again. (Did get entertainment watching other waitstaff hand dishes of food to each other and wander the tables trying to figure out where it was destined.) 5 more minutes - 1 hr 15 minutes after sitting down, we went looking for waitress.  Found her and said cancel order. Her answer ""I'm so sorry. I had issues today and I'll take care of your bill."" Uh, ok, thanks. But really, I would have paid for the ice tea and been a whole lot happier had we been told up front she had issues and we wouldn't be getting any food. Hope anyone going there has better luck - we certainly wouldn't try again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbus-2?start=80
Adam D.,"Grove City, OH",0,1,,2.0,3/29/2016,Service slow the waiter behind us talked way to much about his life.  He completely ruined the mood.  Our waitress very slow not really friendly.  Kids ordered Pizza waitress claimed they where not cooked thru all the way so they had to bake them twice and still not cooked all the way thru.  The chicken I had extremely dry.  Service horrible I guess they should stop talking about their life story and how to become a motivation speaker...oh yea u put me to sleep with ur life story... and focus on their shitty ass jobs....and they messed up the bill....,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbus-2?start=80
Lashana J.,"Blacklick, OH",33,1,,1.0,11/8/2015,"This was the worst experience and service I have had in quite a long time. I had attended a party here, and mind you I have been to BJ'S quite a bit In Polaris and Tuttle mall and have had no problem hosting parties. We reserved for 16 people and when we reserved they told us to come 15 minutes before schedule time. We got there 30 min early. It took 2 hrs to get our table. Some of our guess had to leave by the time we were seated because they had waited sooooooooooo long and had other plans. So when we finally sat down instead of the manager coming out to instantly apologize, he tried to spin it around to make it seem like we did something wrong. They tried to please us by offering a free cookie and ice cream if we spent 9.99 which was already a special everyone else was getting for Halloween. Service was horrible, waiters could not keep up with the orders. It was only 10 people and we had 2 waiters and they still could not get it right. After our bill came we asked for the cookies we were promised and they came back and said we had to split them. I will never visit this location again. It was horrible and in fact me and my family won't be going back to any BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbus-2?start=80

Kimberly H.,"New Albany, OH",1,19,,4.0,9/6/2015,"This place is really a great place to go for a wonderful variety of food.  Their Chicago style deep dish pizza is excellent!!  If you don't want that and prefer a fresh salmon dish, they have it.  If you want Steak they've got it.  Get the picture? Anyway you can go with a group of friends and there will be something to please everybody.  I've been there many times and the best server Zahaire.  He was incredible.  He was attentive and accurate and really a good customer service.  I always make sure to sit in his section.  One time I went there and he wasn't working so I was seated in Nikki's section.  She was fabulous too!!  She made sure we were happy with our food and visit too.  BJs hires exceptional staff from once you walk in the door with the hosts to servers and food quality.    You will be very pleased with the selection, service and affordable prices.  I don't know about you but I find it hard in Ohio to locate an awesome Mojito.   Look no further I have had BJ s original Mojito and it was phenomenal and their watermelon Mojito was good as well.  !  Make your next meal at BJS and you won't be disappointed!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbus-2?start=80
Robert S.,"Chillicothe, OH",52,59,49,3.0,8/9/2015,Had a late lunch here today with a friend and was excited to try BJ's again since I had eaten one in Texas years ago. The hostess tried to seat us but the table wasn't ready yet so we were seated at a small booth for two. We both looked over the menu and both decided to order sirloin steaks. Our waitress took our order. My friend had ordered a wedge salad with no tomatoes. Salad came and it had tomatoes on it. She took the tomatoes off and ate the salad with no complaints. As we were finishing up our salads our waitress came by and asked us if we were ready for the check or did we want dessert??  I told her that we had not even had our main course yet. She looked at us like she was confused. She apologized and said she would check on our food. Food came in a reasonable amount of time and food runner asked us to cut into our steaks. I had ordered my medium and my friend has ordered hers medium well. Mine looked ok but my friends looked medium rare. The food runner apologized and took the steak back. When my friends steak came back it was prepared to her liking at medium well. I was disappointed in the steam asparagus. It was a very small portion and they did not have much seasoning on them. I also thought the sirloin was small for the price. The menu did not specify how many ounces you were to receive. Overall the steak had a good taste. If we go back we both agreed we would try a burger because s neighboring tables burgers looked good. I'm hoping that this new location is still working out all the kinks and will provide a better meal next time we come in. Overall a little less than average dining experience today.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbus-2?start=80
John S.,"Westerville, OH",0,63,,3.0,12/18/2015,We enjoy the Steltzer Rd location much over the Polaris location. Food prep and service are generally better with faster seating.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbus-2?start=80
