Savanna M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",254,966,4960,3.0,6/30/2016,"For some reasons the engineers at my company are obsessed with BJ's.  Personally I think it's a bit too far away from the office to come here for lunch, but they insist it's worth it, and with the pre-ordering option it makes the lunch not run too long.  Those are their opinions, but not mine after visiting here lol. It was a coworker's farewell lunch, so I was somewhat obligated to go.  The ordering ahead sounded like a good idea, and with a party of 20 it definitely is the way to go.  However, this means your food might come out slightly less than fresh (the bun on my burger was quite soggy, another coworker complained his lettuce was rather wilted etc).   We arrived at noon on a Tuesday to find an empty restaurant.  The hostess said she wouldn't seat us for our reservation until half the party arrived, again, we had pre-ordered our food and the place was empty!, so I found this to be a bit odd, but eventually we were sat.   Due to our numbers I think we were given two or more servers which was good for drink ordering etc, but perhaps still not enough as my water went un-refilled.   Those who ordered appetizers, side salads etc, got their food first, and then the main entrees came out.  We had placed our orders ahead of time with names attached, so it did help when the food came out and we had to determine what belonged with who.  I ordered the portobello burger (no actually burger, just mushrooms) with wedge fries.  It was decent, nothing to rave about, and again the bun was pretty soggy, but I'd give it a solid 3 stars.   The menu here is pretty extensive, so there's definitely something for everyone, which is a plus.   The check came, and the easiest thing was just to divide it by 20 and handle it that way per person, so that may be one flaw in ordering in advance too (no individual checks).   Lunch actually took close to 2 hours including the drive, so I'm not too sold on the claim that ordering in advance can make this a quick lunch. If I was in the area I'd consider eating here again, but I won't be coming back for any work lunches, if I can help it lol.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-coral-springs-2?start=20

Willie T.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,1,,1.0,12/2/2017,"We have always gone to Bjs restaurants, in Tampa and Pembroke Pines BUT, this one in Coral Springs needs to adjust their service, for the last few times that weve gone here we have called ahead 30 to 45 minutes, and Every Time we get there, they always tell us that were next or almost there and we end up waiting 30 min to 40 minutes, and then you notice other people show up and they pass them through quickly,  so it makes you wonder why...I speak to the manager and she says pretty much you just have to wait. I ask if theres any point of calling in and she never anwsers me, everytime we go here I have to keep asking the hostess how many more people are before and I dont get called until the whole lobby clears up. They never tell me how many people are waiting, seems like trickery.Their hostess  that was here tonight, Saturday night was rude, she acts like it didn't matter wether your attended or not, she should ask someone if people dont come back theres no need for a hostess. Coral Springs  Bjs should learn from Pembroke Pines how to treat their customers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-coral-springs-2?start=20
Sherrie K.,"Margate, FL",64,60,260,3.0,3/5/2017,"My boyfriend and I went here for lunch on Saturday. The place wasn't very busy so we were seated pretty quickly. We chose to sit outside. Unfortunately, it was really windy that day and the shades they had up kept slamming into the building making a loud noise. It caught me off guard the first time lol! The waitress was nice but service was a little slow. I ordered a mini meat pan pizza and my boyfriend orders spaghetti with meatballs. My pizza was very dry. It had hardly any sauce in it. Other than that it came out hit and fresh and had a lot of neat. So they weren't skimpy in the meat but definitely were with the sauce. My boyfriend said he loved his food. He said it had a good flavor to it. This was my 3rd time at this location. I've never been overly impressed by it but they do have a lengthy menu. I'm sure anyone can find something they want to eat here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-coral-springs-2?start=20
Audrey G.,"Pompano Beach, FL",32,120,82,4.0,7/5/2017,So I've been here 3 times since my last review. I think the burgers are terrific and I love the Santa Fe and barbecue salads.

Holly S.,"Pompano Beach, FL",404,370,434,4.0,11/23/2016,"I liked it a lot but didn't really love it.  I'm not sure what kept me from that 5th star buy something (maybe the ambiance) was off.  Food selection is pretty decent (sandwiches, salads , American cuisine). I guess Innoway this place reminds me of a really big open spaced Bennigan's. We both ordered sandwiches which were really good and of course had to order some drinks to go with it as well. I had the caprisi piadina (I am a big fan of mozzarella and tomato together). This came with shoestring fries which is so so so much better and steak fries. For dessert we split the BJ's Baker Beignet.  The one thing that I will say that I really liked is that there is a very big selection. Sometimes I can be overwhelming however I have been to restaurants before and I just did not like a single thing on the menu and this case if you have dietary restrictions or eat a particular way there's pretty much guaranteed to be something for you here.   If you go on the website it lists gluten-free options as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-coral-springs-2?start=20
Danny M.,"Coral Springs, FL",25,3,,2.0,8/18/2017,Food was very mediocre. I had the prime rib which was over cooked. I asked for a salad wedge no blue cheese. Was brought out with blue cheese.

Alan L.,"Parkland, FL",0,17,1,2.0,6/9/2017,"Tonight we had a substandard experience at BJs.  Usually it is okay, middle of the road chain restaurant. My wife ordered the Brewhouse Burger well done.  When it arrived, it looked like a diner burger that had been smashed down on the grill, and it was rare inside.  We got the server to bring it back, and it took some time for a new one to be delivered.  The server told us the manager would be bringing it, but that did not happen - maybe why we waited to so long.   When the second one came, the server did not wait to see if it was okay or come back to check on us.  I had to flag him down, because the second one was only slightly more done than rare. We were offered a ""free"" dessert as an apology, but we do not eat that stuff.  Iwould have thought there would be an apoogy from the manager, or some credit offered for the burger.  It is not hard to cook a burger, and not hard to make sure it is cooked properly.  This was a disappointing experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-coral-springs-2?start=20
Lee L.,"Ocala, FL",19,113,240,3.0,6/9/2017,"Bj's Restaurant is mediocre for its entrees and selection. The only reason I go here is for their chocolate chip pizookie to be quite honest! The ambiance on the inside of the restaurant is quite nice, giving you an upper class type feel however the menu just does not cut it for me. I struggled to find something to order because nothing caught my eye. This was my second time coming to Bj's and I've noticed that they changed the menu. I used to order the cajun chicken pasta, but now that's not available anymore. I was a little stumped because the one dish I liked was now gone!  BJ's menu to me is all over the place. Meaning what is the concept?  This time, I ordered the parmesan crusted chicken as my entree which came with roasted broccoli and mashed potatoes, but I mistakenly swapped the mashed potatoes out for a broccoli cheddar soup (HUGE mistake)! The soup was extremely cheesy, so I did not finish it. I was told by a friend after my experience that the mashed potatoes are to die for, so if you are going to choose this dish, then I guess stick with the mashed potatoes. We also ordered a couple appetizers,avocado egg rolls, calamari, artichoke dip and a California chicken flatbread. All of these items were pretty good, but nothing special or different than what you can find at a TGIF or Chili's. The ONLY reason I would be willing to go to BJ's would be for their chocolate chip pizookie!! It is basically a cookie that is baked in a deep dish (like a pizza) and has a couple scoops of vanilla piled on top. The cookie is warm and with the ice cream, you achieve that melt in your mouth chocolatey goodness!!! Plus, if it's your birthday, you receive a free mini pizookie with a candle lit in it!

Nicole V.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",416,431,1047,2.0,10/9/2016,"If you're in a hurry or even if you're not, this is NOT the place to come. I suggested this place for lunch for my friend's birthday. While I haven't been in quite some time, it has a diverse menu. We went on a Sunday at 1:30. I half expected a wait for a party of 5 people. We walked right in. The hostess sat us towards the back room away from the bar and there was only 2 other tables of 2 in the room. We looked at the menu for quite awhile before our server came over to take our drink order. We ordered 2 apps (artichokes and asparagus). She eventually made her way back with drinks. The apps were very good and she took our orders.  The food took an insane amount of time to come out and to make matters worse only 2 meals came out and 3 of us went without for about 10 minutes. All of the dishes should have come together!  I ordered a ""deep dish pizza"". The food runner who dropped it off was carrying it with tongs and warned me that it was extremely hot. Imagine my surprise when I took a bite and it was warm at best. It also wasn't very ""deep"" if you ask me but it had good flavor. Everyone else enjoyed their meals. My boyfriend ordered the New Orleans Jambalaya. It was pretty spicy so when he asked for a drink refill and it took more than 10+ minutes to get a water, I had to flag another employee down to see what was taking so long.  We were reluctant to order dessert because lunch was going on 90+ minutes already. When I mentioned my friend's birthday, the waitress offered a special birthday dessert. That took another 12 minutes! She failed to bus the table so we had dirty plates everywhere.... gross! To be proactive, I had my credit card waiting along with the $10 off $35 coupon I downloaded. Again, to get my card back and sign took an exorbitant amount of time. The waitress apologized for the ""little inconveniences"" that occurred. I honestly wanted to speak with the manager about the horrible service but I saw her running food and she had RBF so I'm not sure what good it would have done.   2 1/2 hours for lunch is insane especially when they were not busy! If they don't fix their service issues, they will most definitely be out of business soon. I've worked in the industry. I realize stuff happens, you're short staffed on the floor or kitchen but the basics like making sure your customers have drinks and food arrives at the same time is service 101!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-coral-springs-2?start=20

Karen P.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",48,49,65,5.0,8/19/2016,"I can't believe I've lived in South Florida almost my entire life and I've never been here before. This restaurant is great!  My husband had two of the BJ's beer (the red and the regular IPA - both were great). I had their homemade cream soda which was sweet and delicious.  My husband ordered the bbq chicken salad which was good though not fantastic. The real star of the meal was my chicken bacon and ranch deep dish pizza - delicious flavors and the dough was soft and fluffy.  Lastly, dessert. Oh my. BJ's has their own special dessert called a pizookie. It's a big cookie with ice cream on top. They have multiple flavors. We got cookies and cream. Photo posted.  Also check their website - they post coupons. We got our dessert for free. You can also call ahead to put your name on the seating list, which saves some time especially on a Friday or Saturday night. Finally, I must mention our server, Melissa Faye. She was absolutely fantastic and a highlight of our experience at BJ's.

It was cold when it arrived too since it took 45 minutes after we ordered.

Andy V.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",936,1409,6942,4.0,1/12/2016,"Ever come to a place and not be in the mood for it and just worry you'd not like it for really no reason other than just not knowing what to expect? That was me at BJ's and I am glad I pushed myself to go. We got there, stood around while som girls talked who were working there and then eventually we were seated. It's a pub/brewery type of place so it has a cool vibe- darkish lights but well enough to still see your dinner companion and your food. It's large but not overly loud which tends to happen in these types of places. Our server was great. Our food came out so fast. My dining partner didn't like the way her chicken tasted so they immediately let her pick something else without any hassle. For my appetizer I had the Brussels sprouts with honey glaze on them- oh em gee. I could have ate my weight in those. And only 220 calories if you still have a New Years resolution. The portion wasn't big but it was delicious. The ahi tuna salad was pretty bomb. Full of tuna which a lot of times when I get this salad at places it's overpriced and small- neither is the case here. The wasabi was firing hot. The dressing was sweet and light and the vegetables were fresh and crispy. Their menu was much larger than I expected. Their burgers looked amazing as they were being served to people. Next time I go have to try their deep dish pizza, a burger, or one of their famous pizookies!

Brittany O.,"Boca Raton, FL",244,47,31,4.0,3/29/2017,"Walked in late around 9:15 on a Tuesday and asked to be seated outside, the hosted explained the outside area was closed for seating for the night. Okay I'll sit at a table, then she asked if we mind sitting by the bar and I explained I had a friend meeting me who was pregnant and we needed something that had a little more room for her. At this point the hostess seemed a little bothered at this point and said she needed to ask the waitress if it was okay which seemed a little strange but ok finally we get seated. The waiter we got was a very tall and handsome young man, he was very polite and knowledgeable. We waited a while for my friend to show up and he kept checking on us to make sure we were doing well, which is something I truly appreciate being a part of the biz I know how it can get. Anyway moving on to ordering the food, I couldnt decide between the Pulled turkey dip or the Parmesan crusted chicken, I asked the waiters advice and with no hesitation he replied the chicken. So I ordered it and it was amazing !!!! Getting on to desert now just so everyone is aware every Tuesday Pizookie are only $3 (the full sized one)!!!! I will be back on Tuesdays for that special.  On another note, after dinner we went out for a smoke and I notice there was no ash tray and  people were putting there cig butts in the cracks on top of the trash can which I think is very dangerous, possibly getting a butt can or something of the sort would be a great touch!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-coral-springs-2?start=20

They load it with avocado and that can never go wrong! And the poozkie you literally can never go wrong with. Warm and gooey in the middle with a nice crust surrounding it! I got the trip platter and got the macadamia nut, Oreo, and Triple chocolate made with Ghiradelli. The macadamia nut was good, wasn't a hugeeee fan of it. Next time I might sub out my trip for the peanut butter poozkie. The triple chocolate is so rich and delectable! Some bites I feel like the chocolate ice cream was just a bit to overwhelming but I will just make it a double chocolate instead of a triple next time and sub out the ice cream with vanilla! Lol. The Oreo is THE ""WINNER""! Seriously each bite it literally tasted like a Oreo it's the best!

Andrew M.,"Buffalo, NY",84,20,,3.0,12/7/2016,One of the big things I enjoy about living in Buffalo is that we a wide verity of restaurants to go to that are not chain restaurants. When I moved to Florida a lot of people said that chain restaurants are a dime a dozen down there.  After being in Florida for a month or so the chain restaurant thing got kind of stale and we didn't enjoy going out to eat as much. No yes there was all new places to check out and they mostly had the same menus or something similar in a different form. When we found BJ's we were a bit hesitant as we didn't really look at the menu before hand since it was a quick dinner stop while Christmas shopping.  Over all I thought that they had a great menu and they had some different options for drinks and desserts as well. The wait staff seemed a little uninterested and it was hard to get our servers attention from time to time. One of the perks was the music in the restaurant was great! It know it sounds corny because it was just some radio station but they played great alternative music that just wasn't readily available to listen to on the radio down there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-coral-springs-2?start=40

Rebecca H.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/16/2017,"On behalf of my mother: ""Last night, 6 of us went to BJ's in Coral Springs. We called ahead and had another 30 minutes to wait when we got there , no worries. We really weren't in a hurry. We got seated 20 minutes later but it took some doing because they tried to put six adults into a booth that was accommodating to four adults and two kids not six adults. The air conditioning wasn't working right. The fans helped but it was uncomfortable. Musta been 80 degrees in there. We finally got seated at a table. It took 2 requests and 40 minutes to get water. It took 35 minutes to get the appetizer which came burnt and cool. It took another 30 minutes for dinner to arrive. 4 dinners were returned because they were ice cold ( as in out of a refrigerator),1 dinner was already being remade in the kitchen because of an error they made while they were preparing it. 1 dinner was ok, probably because it was a sandwich and needed no cooking. 2 dinners returned came back ok. One was so salty it couldn't be eaten. And the 4th just gave up and didn't reorder. The 5th came back so late she wasn't Hungry. The bill was wrong. It took another x amount of time to fix it. No manager ever came by during the course of the evening so we asked to speak to one while we were waiting for the bill. No one came. We went to search one out and 16 minutes later he arrived at the table. No apologies no nothing. He didn't want to hear anything that anyone had to say. He seemed annoyed as he was stuck in the kitchen cooking. Not a very nice person and certainly not someone who should represent a large restaurant chain. He did not seem to want to hear or do anything but in the end, he took our bills. We got there at 7:30 and we left at 10:20, hungry, hot and bothered.

I like their menu, it's a little more upscale than say, Chili's and the such, but their prices are still very reasonable. They also offer healthier options such as Quinua bowls, and brown rice. Their lite menu truly feels lite, not just the same food, only half the serving (or less, you know who you are *cough Cheese Cake Factory)  On this visit I had the light thyme chicken. It was delicious. Only 690 calories according to the menu, but it didn't lack flavor. It was still a lot of food. One thing I noticed and commented on was how hot this dish was. This is not a complaint! Often times my food is luke warm and that is a turn off for me. The fact that we came close to closing time, and my food was piping hot, was a definite plus for me. Hubby had a full rack of ribs and they were falling off the bone, finger licking good... I'm not a rib person, and I had some. Service was good. Not out of this world, but good.

The food menu is overwhelming for me, like a Cheesecake Factory kind of assortment and I never know what to order. The food is good, you can get pretty much anything.

When you get it right, fresh and hot the first time, it actually is pretty good.  On all occasions, they have messed up my sandwich order of either no onions or mayo.  If you don't like something on a dish, you can't just take it off, the flavor is still there.  Second, everyone's food comes out at different times, what's the point?   One of the times, I literally had to leave my friend after waiting over 20 minutes and asking the waiter several times for the check.  I shouldn't have to beg to pay a check.  I tried to track down the manager to get the bill, yet couldn't find one.  I went up to the waiter and told him I was leaving. I don't understand why people go back for horrific service and food that comes out cold and wrong every single time.  Will never go back to this restaurant again.  They need to properly re-train every single staff member of this place, front to back, especially management.

Denise G.,"Oakland Park, FL",98,7,,1.0,10/19/2017,"Went here Sunday night for a quick bite, sadly the place wasn't extremely busy. Was sat in Brooke's section, she was very pleasant BUT after placing a drink and food order got our appetizer BEFORE every getting a water or cocktail... then mini pizza came it was very doughy and although edible wasn't great. Brooke asked if we would like anything else, yes, Parmesan cheese for the pizza. Of course that was brought with 1 slice left to eat. I went to speak with a manager who could CARE LESS about my concerns, NEVER came over to my table after my complaint. Brooke was more concerned with me speaking to management then management. Brooke gets 4 stars on sweetness but needs a lil work on order and customer expectations.. I would love a drink before food arrives. WONT BE BACK, not even due to Brooke, she is human and perhaps felt overwhelmed, the manager's aloof attitude is not someplace I care to spend my hard earned money on..

Rick S.,"Pompano Beach, FL",1,3,2,3.0,2/19/2017,"Was my first time in this restaurant. Anytime I go to a new place, I like to try something they are known for. I saw they started out in Chicago as a pizza place, so naturally I tried the deep dish ""Chicago"" pizza. I got the five meat special. I wasn't too thrilled with it, to be honest. It wasn't very deep, but I loved the way it was served. The taste was nothing to brag about.  Our waitress was great, she was very polite and super thorough. No one had to ask for anything more than once and the decor was expansive and comfortable. I also ordered calamari as an appetizer and would definitely recommend that dish to anyone looking for solid calamari.  If you are a Pokémon Go player, there's a stop right at the front of the restaurant, and you can't go wrong waiting on your table and getting some pocket monsters while you wait!  Overall, I'd say you won't get ripped off going to BJ's, but if you are looking to be wowed by their ""deep dish"" pizza, you'll be deeply disappointed.

Gary S.,"Coral Springs, FL",1,2,,1.0,7/16/2017,"Last night, 6 of us went to BJ's in Coral Springs. We called ahead and had another 30 minutes to wait when we got there , no worries. We really weren't in a hurry. We got seated 20 minutes later but it took some doing because they tried to put six adults into a booth that was accommodating to four adults and two kids not six adults. The air conditioning wasn't working right. The fans helped but it was uncomfortable. Musta been 80 degrees in there.  We finally got seated at a table.  It took 2 requests and 40 minutes to get water. It took 35 minutes to get the appetizer which came burnt and cool. It took another 30 minutes for dinner to arrive. 4 dinners were returned because they were ice cold ( as in out of a refrigerator),1 dinner was already being remade in the kitchen because of an error they made while they were preparing it. 1 dinner was ok, probably because it was a sandwich and needed no cooking. 2 dinners returned came back ok. One was so salty it couldn't be eaten. And the 4th just gave up and didn't reorder. The 5th came back so late she wasn't Hungry. The bill was wrong. It took another x amount of time to fix it.  No manager ever came by during the course of the evening so we asked to speak to one while we were waiting for the bill. No one came. We went to search one out and 16 minutes later he arrived at the table. No apologies no nothing. He didn't want to hear anything that anyone had to say.  He seemed annoyed as he was stuck in the kitchen cooking. Not a very nice person and certainly not someone who should represent a large restaurant chain. He did not seem to want to hear or do anything but in the end, he took our bills. We got there at 7:30 and we left at 10:20, hungry, hot and bothered. I don't recommend BJ's in Coral Springs until they fix their problems including their management.

Heath W.,"Coral Springs, FL",66,39,15,2.0,5/11/2016,"Update- I received a response from regional management who addressed our concerns, which is more than I can say for other big restaurants.  The food is excellent and the menu changes frequently with updated offerings, we stop by often and while the food is great the service has been iffy each time we have been here, it's either the servers are overwhelmed with too many tables, because they do try and they try hard, or the kitchen manger is just in need of serious improvement. Orders do not come out timely or in clumps with dishes meant for other travels mixed into our orders. It's been this way since they opened. I don't blame the servers but the kitchen management and the GM, I am not ever sure they read these reviews, since this isn't the first review which seems to state the obvious, if they do or better yet if corporate reads these they should seriously consider a management upgrade.  This place has potential but one of the reasons we don't go as often as we should is because of the poor management issues mentioned above, if the service was better we would go more. For example this afternoon my during lunch our tables order didn't come out all at once but was mixed with another tables order, some at our table were served and some at their table was served leaving half of out table to wait to be served and the rest waiting to start to eat, the same with the other table not in our party.  This is just one detailed example, there are others.

Just like a regular root beer with a kick.  There strawberry martini was strong and sweet.  The margarita wasn't bad either.  The bartender we had was very nice and fast.   For dinner we started off with the Best beginners appetizer combo, which had Spinach and Artichoke dip, Avocado egg roll, Sante fe spring rolls and Mozzarella sticks.   The sante fe spring rolls reminded me a lot like Chili's egg rolls.  The avocado egg rolls are my favorite.  Spinach and artichoke was just okay,  not the best I've had and the mozzarella sticks tasted just like any mozzarella stick.   For my entree I had the Deep dish lasagna. It's was like having a creamy cheese filled ravioli with Italian sausage and pepperoni pizza in one dish.  You would love this dish if you like ravioli, sausage and pepperoni.  My husband had the Southern fried chicken which came with peppercorn gravy,  mash potatoes and corn.  I tried it and it was delicious.  My sister had the bbq bison burger and I don't like bison at all and I actually liked the flavor of the burger.  I  wasn't gamy at all.   My aunt had the mac and cheese and she didn't like it at all.  Thought it tasted like the mac and cheese from Pizza Hut and it had way too much garlic in it.  My cousin and uncle had the seared Ahi tuna salad.  It was very light and refreshing.

Casey M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",115,97,67,2.0,12/3/2013,"So we decided to wait before eating here for a while based on all the bad reviews.  The reviews sort of made us under the impression that most of the issues for this place were primarily service related, which we were optimistic would work themselves out over time. Well.. service was unfortunately still an issue! We were some of the first people there for lunch, and we waited about 15 minutes for someone to come to our table.  There were only 3 other tables seated! :(  The food was pretty okay though. Their thin cut fries are delish. My husband had the turkey cobb sandwich, which he would not order again.  It sounded interesting in concept, but the quality of the turkey really killed the whole sandwich.  I ordered the jalepeno burger.. Hm.. let me break down my review of this item a little more in depth. Jalepeno Burger Breadown: 1.  I hate when restaurants only serve 1/2 lb burgers - it's too much meat! (This was the case at BJ's) 2.  The flavor of the burger was unique, which is something that makes a restaurant a keeper for me. The fried jalepenos were indeed tasty. 2.  Overall though, too much meat and too little flavor. :(  I would not order again. The beer was so-so. We are big microbrew fans, so we have high standards.  We would go back here, but mostly just because we were in the area looking for something to eat and didn't feel like going to Big Bear.  Big Bear has better food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-coral-springs-2?start=100

We should've left at that point.Eventually we ordered our entrees and a chips & queso appetizer. It took a while and when the queso arrived it was cold enough to have formed a ""skin"" on the top. That's pretty bad. Entrees arrived 58 minutes after we initially sat down. Two burgers, fish tacos, and a kids mac & cheese. All fries were cold, one burger was cold, and the mac & cheese was so cold it wasn't even funny anymore. The waitress never apologized or even acknowledged that  everything was stupid slow. I'm generally a 20-25% tipper. Even when the food isn't great, I always tip based on service because the wait staff can't always control the kitchen. This was the first time in my life that I gave no tip at all. She truly didn't deserve her hourly wage much less a tip.

The challenge is seasoning as they need more while cooking and in their dressing and sauces.  The Piszookies (desert baked cookie) are rich and worth every penny.  Kids loved the salted caramel offering.   Our servers on both nights were very accommodating and well trained.  The wait was reasonable and call ahead is offered.  No management was seen on floor in either visit nor mingling with visitors and clients.   They offer a Reward program but blatantly take back your points if you don't visit enough within a year !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-coral-springs-2?start=120
Scott O.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,14,1,2.0,3/3/2016,"Went 2 weeks ago with a buddy on a Thursday at 7:30. The place was pretty busy but there was immediate outdoor seating. We waited almost 10 minutes before a server came by to take our drink order. Mine was a Tanqueray and tonic. When it came it was visibly flat and tasted the same way. I sent it back and received another that wasn't flat but was close to it. We order an everything deep dish pizza. I'm on a low carb diet and this was my cheat night so I had high hopes. After about 30 minutes the pizza comes out the server warns us it's hot as he puts it down using tongs so he doesn't get burned.  The first thing we noticed was how small the pizza was. The pan was deep but the pizza only came half the way up. If you took it and put it in a box it would look like a regular sized pizza. Deep dish pizza is supposed to be think and sloppy where you need a knife and fork. This was not (and not worth $25!). Next thing we noticed was the lack of cheese. There was some cheese in between the other things on the pizza but there was no layer of cheese as you would expect.  After taking a bite the next noticeable thing was that it was luke warm at best. I had the manager come over and when I picked the pan up with my bare hands he got the picture. We had waited so long, we didn't feel like sending it back so ate it as it was. Pretty lame for a $25 pizza. I took a picture but can't post it here. The only reason why they didn't get 1 star is because the manager didn't charge for the first drink and took 50% off the pizza. I go there frequently for lunch and get the roasted salmon which is outstanding.

I've been to the location in Clearwater and the location in Lake Buena Vista, in addition to the one here in Coral Springs and in every single establishment I have been less then impressed (Clearwater is probably the best out of all three I have gone to). The food is ok - they have a large variety - and I hear the beer is good. Oh, and they do have Gluten Free Pizza, which is actually pretty good. I have been to the Coral Springs location twice and the first time they charged my credit card twice for the bill and the second time, which was today the service was SO slow (food took over an hour to arrive and we ordered a salad and a burger) I was ready to get up and walk out. I could understand if they were busy, but there really wasn't that many people there.  The server we got today was apologetic about the food taking so long, so I would say that the staff is nice.

Cherine A.,"Coconut Creek, FL",734,675,663,2.0,3/16/2014,"Originally I was very excited to see this place open in Coral Springs. It's easy to get stuck in a rut with the dining options around (Big Bear is still my favorite, but variety is nice too). Having eaten at the BJ's in Pembroke Pines twice, and enjoying my experiences there, I keep finding myself disappointed during my trips to this location. First of all, the service has never been very good. On our latest visit, I could've sworn our waitress actually avoided us. My mom asked for a split of champagne (and requested for it to be really cold), and it was delivered warm. As in, had never been refrigerated at any point. The waitress brought the bottle and a beer glass (?!) and walked away. Didn't open the bottle and pour it, just left. I guess it was better that she did that, considering the champagne was WARM. Attempts to flag her down and request a cold bottle were futile, so I chugged my water until the glass only had ice, and put her bottle in my glass so it could get colder. Eventually our waitress came by and saw what we had done, and said nothing. Didn't offer to put the bottle in ice for us (we still hadn't opened it), just pretended it was completely normal. Every time I've visited here, I've tried something different, but I have yet to come across a dish I've actually really enjoyed. The parmesan crusted chicken was bland, and the white cheddar mashed potatoes that accompanied it had not an ounce of cheddar anywhere near them. On my latest visit, I tried the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos. They were decent... best thing I've had here so far... but that's not exactly high praise either. They were just fine. The only thing I've eaten here that I've actually enjoyed is the mini chocolate chip pizookie... I mean, who could complain about a warm, freshly-baked cookie? But that hardly makes a meal. After each visit here, I've left wishing we'd gone to Big Bear instead. I'm sure I'll end up back here... and maybe this next time I'll find something I really like and have good service.

Esty F.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",849,70,3,2.0,9/9/2014,"My 3rd time at BJ's was NOT a charm. First time - opening jitters so ok, understandable 2nd time - very awkward seating for a group, slow service and mediocre food. 3rd time - once again just not comfortable, so loud, servers rushing by you, friendly servers but they disappear.  I have tried a few things here - the ""gumbo"" was bad, some of the appetizers are pretty good. Best to stick with an appetizer or a burger IMHO - the ""main dishes"" leave a lot to be desired.  Maybe just not ""my"" kind of place,  the decor is very impressive but the acoustics are horrible. Still I guess a lot of people ""love"" it cause the line is always big and always a wait.

Marcos M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1,15,,1.0,10/3/2016,"We've been to this location several times. The food is usually very tasty but value is lacking compared to other similar restaurants. The Mediterranean chicken pita wrap is very small and has a minimal amount of chicken. The salads are decent size but are also light on protein. The flat breads are very tasty and a good choice. The restaurant is kept very cool and was unusually cold on the last visit. This is Florida where the temperature is over 90 outside and people are wearing shorts and T shirts. The temperature inside was probably 65-68 degrees. I observed people going to their cars for sweaters and jackets. I asked the server 2 times to adjust the temperature.  Last, but certainly not least, I went to the restroom upon arrival. The toilet in one stall was full and I attempted to flush it but it would not flush. I went to the other stall and there was no toilet paper with 2 empty rolls. I immediately went to the front desk and advised the hostess who said she would take care of it. Service was very slow at the restaurant. Just before leaving, 1-1/2 hours later, I went to the restroom again. The toilet was still stuffed and would not flush in one stall and still 2 empty rolls and no toilet paper in the other stall. People used paper toilet seat covers for toilet paper and left soiled ones on the floor. I immediately asked to speak to the manager on duty who said the restrooms should have been checked every 15 minutes. Not sure if employees use the same restroom but it is apparent no one had serviced the restroom in a very long time given that there were 2 empty toilet paper rolls. It is unacceptable that this was not addressed when first brought to the attention of the hostess 1-1/2 hours earlier.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-coral-springs-2?start=160
Stephen F.,"Apopka, FL",116,647,692,2.0,8/6/2014,"I knew going in that the reviews for this place weren't great but after being in business for a while I was hoping the kinks were worked out, unfortunately I think they still have a ways to go. That being said, I really wanted to like BJ's, I love beer and I love simple food, burgers, wings etc.... This was one of those meals where immediately I knew it was going to go south. My dining partner ordered Absolut & Diet Coke, our waiter asked if Absolut was Vodka, ah yeah... (side note they sell Pepsi products not coke products). I ordered a flight of beer and apparently the word ""flight"" stymied our waiter, he had no idea what I was talking about. You're a brewhouse, it's noted in your name the word ""flight"" is very common in the beer world. Can I please have a sample of four of your beers. We asked our waiter for an appetizer recommendation and he suggested the Avocado Rolls, sounds good we'll have an order. When they arrived they were a mess, falling apart with each bite (side note your silverware setups should include a spoon, some people might not appreciate double dipping in your sweet tamarind sauce). We made it through two and took the other four home for whatever reason. Our drinks came, my flight of beer, which was actually good beer and earned them an extra star, my dining partners Absolut & Diet Pepsi arrived in two glasses, one full of Absolut and the other full of Diet Pepsi.......huh, never in all of my years have I ever seen someone show up with two glasses when we ordered an Absolut & Diet Pepsi, it was all I could muster to ask for a glass so my dining partner could mix their own drink.   By the way this drink combination cost $13.00 and my dining companion spilled half the Absolut mixing their own drink. Our meal order consisted of a BJ's Brewhouse Burger medium well with no mayonnaise and an order of Boneless Wings Medium our waiter actually asked ""so you want your wings cooked medium?"",  huh... yes I'm looking for a mid-week case of Salmonella, no I was looking for medium spice please. Five minutes later he came back to the table to say that they only offered mild & hot spice not a medium. Our meals arrived, my dining partners burger arrived with some kind of a sauce on it, remember they ordered ""no mayonnaise"", if it came with some sort of a sauce our waiter should have known that, same with no medium wing sauce. This was the most medium well cooked burger on the planet, the outside was cooked so well it was caramelized. The boneless wings were so heavily breaded that I honestly have no idea if there was any chicken in it at all, and half of the boneless wings had no sauce on them at all. I know you coat the wings after they are cooked but please make sure they're evenly coated. Again, I really wanted to like this place and possibly everyone involved in my meal was newly hired, but this was brutal. I rarely give 2 star reviews but it was honestly earned.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-coral-springs-2?start=160

Food is awesome especially the glazed ribs (full rack) or the fried chicken breast with cheddar mashed potatoes - too good to be true. If you are ever dining for lunch; amount is decent when you look at your plate it's a small portion (that's the right portion we are suppose to eat anyways) but you will get full; both seafood chowder & chicken tortilla soup is awesome you get enough serving. Happy hour is usually after lunch but if you are like me & you always miss it there is late night happy hour. Honestly their happy hour sucks $1 draft beers & $2 off shareable apps ehhh I might as well pay for the reg. price ijs. But that's not going to make my ratings go down. I LOVE my Root Beer no matter what & the best ones are the ones on tap which they have!!! It has a hint of toffee in their with such a tasty aroma aroma, bubbly delight. There desserts are phenomenal my personal favorite is the peanut butter smores pzookie topped with vanilla ice cream served in a warm skillet. Indeed it is sweet but that's why it's a dessert & marshmallowy goodness so good with the melted marshmallows on a bed of a moist chocolate cake the vanilla bean ice cream even it all that sweetness. Or get the strawberry beignet it's warm fluffy pastry sprinkled with confectioners sugar topped with real strawberries & strawberry syrup & of course vanilla bean ice cream. This is a delight as well. Either way you go you won't regret it.

After a 3 minute debate between them they decided it to have us sit down in the patio area that was complexly empty accept for one table being used !.

My most recent trip was probably my worst experience yet at BJ's.  I ordered from the 2 for $19.99 menu which included soup, salad, pizza, and a pizookie.  We got soup and a salad that were okay.  We also got a pizza plus a flat bread that was not part of the 2 for $19.99 but we wanted to try it anyway.  The pizza came with onions on it when it did not have onions listed on the menu.  I dislike onions.  When we told the waitress this she said its a good thing you ordered a 2nd pizza. The 2nd pizza was delayed.  Before it came out the waitress told us our pizookie was ready and asked if we wanted it now.  We said no since we had not gotten the rest of our dinner yet.  She said okay then came back 10 minutes later with the pizookie and said out pizza got delayed again and she did not want the pizookie to get cold.  The pizookie itself was pretty well done.  We finished it then got our 2nd pizza. At no point were we ever offered refills on our drinks.  When we got our check they forgot to give us the special price.  This just added another annoyance to the meal.

We got a table quickly by the bar (kinda lucky on this).    I sampled a few of their beers, starting with an IPA (my favorite type of beer) and it was really average at best.  I had to go 4 samples of different kinds of beer just to find something drinkable.       We ordered lettuce wraps and they were decent.   I had a salad and it was decent.   We ordered two min pizzas and they were just plain horrible.   They were thick (why, oh why were you thick???).    No need..make them flat bread style.   And they just didn't taste great.    Only thing going was all this stuff was 1/2 off due to happy hour during football games. Then, heading to the bathrooms I almost slipped 5x (and was wearing rubber soles).  My wife commented on the same thing.    It's just a lawsuit waiting to happen.     The floors in the restaurant as well as the floors near the bathrooms are super slippery.

Andre R.,"Hollywood, FL",0,1,,1.0,9/29/2017,"There is only one thing worse than being served a terrible meal: being served a terrible meal by an earnest bartender who's ""regular"" is hawking the first time customer for their seats at the bar. The definition of a paying customer is not concrete at this establishment. Not only are entitled snobs allowed to stand behind and chirp at the customer enjoying their Friday night but they are encouraged to time the customer from last bite to payment of bill. And so to the fine establishment that is BJ's Restaurant & Brewery in the fine city of Coral Springs Florida, or the scene of the crime as I now like to call it, I find you guilty. You are guilty for not having a timer on the back of each bar stool to let the fine high class people stalking behind the paying customer know that the customer sitting at the bar must stop drinking their beers and give up their seats immediately after paying their bill. This is not sports bar and the customer is not allowed to watch sports and finish their beers.

When we asked our waiter he said yes they were supposed to be on the sandwich took the check and brought it back without changing anything.  I ordered a pulled pork sandwich which has always been excellent until today. It was the worst. A very small amount of meat with a piece of bread that the cook put mayonnaise on and then wiped it off. It looked as it was rushed while putting it together and was full of fat. Needless to say we will not be eating here for a long time.  I had to give them 2 stars for the homemade sodas that they The server was very good. I believe her name was Virginia.

Sidra A.,"Boca Raton, FL",62,109,132,2.0,8/14/2017,"I have seen the big building for BJ's restaurant everytime I drive down University, but never had the chance to try it. Yesterday my friend wanted me to meet his sister and kids so we decided to finally check this place out. It is quite impressive when you walk in; with high ceilings, black furnishings, and dim lighting. We were seated at a circle booth, which we liked. We noticed that the menus were all different. Apparently, there are 2 editions and they didn't bother to toss the old ones out. This caused some confusion in ordering. Secondly, the kids both ordered chicken nuggets. After 15 minutes, the server came out to tell us that they did not have any. I don't know why this could not have been communicated earlier. We placed orders for alternate items. A few minutes later, we got our deep dish pizza. It was done well, albeit a little pricey for $15. They forgot to bring the Dr. Pepper and we were waiting for a long time. Meanwhile kids were sitting hungry and tired, while adults ate.  Finally kids food arrived. Kid 1 liked his grilled cheese sandwich, but kid 2 hated his fettuccine alfredo. We had asked for a box for the soup and dip and it came at the very end. Anyway, when it came time for dessert, we were so tired of waiting around that we decided to pay the bill and walk over to Chili's. Yes, it looks nice and fancy but the service is slow and the food is the same quality at Chili's, with a higher price. I felt bad to meet his sister first time and to have a negative experience.

First the beers: not good - the weiss was watery and not appealing, the IPA was more of a pale ale and not much better than a Budweiser.  The Bison was way over cooked (asked for rare) and was shaped like a meatball on an oversized bun.  No kidding the bun was 5 inches and the ""meatball"" was 2.5 inches. Not a lettuce leaf just the thick spine.   The pizzas was a mushroom and artichoke. The cheese was virtually missing and the mushroom and artichoke were hardly present. It was all deep dish crust and a cameo appearance of  Messrs. cheese, sauce, mushroom and artichokes. The service was good and the chocolate ice cream was good but nothing else.

The outside of the building is beautiful and the inside is nice as well. However, the music does not need to be blasting. The seats to the booth were all wet we had to ask for them to be dried off. The napkins were placed on the table and those were wet. All of them ! We were a party of 3 so we ordered the large deep dish pizza with pepperoni. Asked for it well done. Someone else ordered the sirloin steak. While waiting for the meal I was looking over the menu and realized they have a large deep dish for $25 and then a build your own for $15 and change. Asked the waiter the difference in the two pepperoni pizzas. Oh, he says, the build your own comes with two toppings. Ok, then why,  didn't you explain this in the beginning? Changed the order to the build your own pepperoni and sausage and saved $10. Ordered a small side Caesar that was ok. The mozzarella ball side salad with the sirloin was just ok. Never saw such tiny mozzarella balls, they were the size of small gum balls. The steak arrived first and it was five minutes until the pizza arrived. The sirloin steak was so overly seasoned and extremely salty. My party had  to scrape the seasoning off the steak just to eat it. The asparagus was dried out.  Then 5 minutes later the pizza arrived. When you order two toppings aren't they usually spread across the whole pizza? Half was pepperoni the other sausage.  Let me say that there was so much butter on the bottom crust that it was soggy. This is not the pizza I expected. Very disappointed.  On a good note, your root beer was good and I don't like root beer. Water was good too. Now I can still feel all that butter just sitting in my stomach. And your floor is so slippery, greasy and sticky I almost fell. I will not be back.

Brandon L.,"Sunrise, FL",13,20,8,4.0,3/22/2014,"I do love Yelp, and those who provide feedback. My wife and I tend to lean toward any restaurant with 3 or more stars and would go to the lowers only if we felt ambitious enough to spend money in a place with a bad rap sheet. Despite the average being a bit low, we decided to take a risk and give BJ's a shot. Calling ahead is a requirement, as it seems to always be packed to the brim. The outside was well kept and the inside was huge, nicely decorated and not cluttered with TVs. We are seated towards the back at a bench table, and begin glancing at the all-in-one booze, entree and dessert menu. Our waiter (let's call him B) comes and asks for our drink order, which prompts me to try their beer sampler as I have been growing accustomed to do. I was shocked at the quality of their in-house beer, as in the Tatonka Stout is now one of my favorite beers of all time. The ""small-bites"" section intrigued my wife and I, being full of small, lower cost appetizers. We order the stuffed mushrooms, the best we've had at a restaurant in a long time.  B then returns and takes our entree order, consisting of a rib-eye done rare and chicken pita tacos. An average wait time was accompanied by a second round of other beers in a sampler, all of which were good. The tacos were unique and decent on flavor, not even requiring the Greek yogurt crema it comes with.  Sadly, the rib-eye was not given the same treatment. Asking for rare translated to medium in the kitchen. If it didn't translate well, then we must find some way to translate to them that salt and pepper is all that's needed to do a steak justice. Indeed there is the black and white shakers at the table, but they didn't even attempt to season it. At least the veggies and potatoes were better than average, and thank you for not providing soggy green beans (my pet peeve). A cookies 'n' cream pazookie to take home ended our meal. B did an average job, attentive and knowledgeable but always overlooked the empty plates and beer glasses. This place exceeded our original expectations, especially since we experienced Big Bear Brewing Company in weeks past and believed BJ's couldn't mimic their quality.

JL Q.,"Pompano Beach, FL",36,185,101,4.0,8/25/2013,"We went to the ""soft opening"" and that was rather hit or miss.  But after the grand opening, we visited on a busy Sunday afternoon, in between lunch and the early bird and the place couldn't me more packed! We decided to take the outside seating as there was no waiting for that.  We opted for the hightop tables and loved being able to see over everything that was going on around us.  Our server quicly brought our beer pitcher out and the only comment I'd say that could help would be to use the kind of pitchers that can have ice in the core to keep the beer cool.  Since we were outside, it didn't take long for our beer to get warm. We ordered the Chicago-style deep dish pizza and I thought I was back in the Windy City when we tasted it.  My husband thought it needed sauce because it didn't have any, but I liked it the way it was.  And oh, boy, was it good!  We never left one morsel!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-coral-springs-2?start=220

We called the restaurant, and while they don't take reservations, we were able to call-ahead. We got to the restaurant and it was packed, but since we called ahead, we were seated within 10-15 minutes.  The food came out good and the pumpkin beer I had was excellent. I will admit that the service was kind of slow, but we were having a good time and weren't in any rush to leave. Despite this, the waitress was very friendly and warm.

Joshua N.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",92,11,,2.0,10/27/2013,"I went on a Friday night around 10pm. We were told by the hostess that outside had open seating and to go ahead and seat ourselves. After sitting outside for 10 minutes we had figured out that we had been forgotten. So we decided to ask to sit inside where we were once told again to go ahead and seat ourselves anywhere in the bar area. This place was not crazy busy either. It would have been nice if the hostess could of stopped her conversation with her friend to seat us.  Our server was friendly and attentive. The building is nice with ambient lighting and high ceilings. They had a very large beer selection and an extensive menu. I was confused at first because the first two pages were all different types of pizza. I was like, "" Is this a pizza place?"" None of the drinks on the menu had prices which I hate and makes me feel cheap to even ask so i don't. So it's kinda like a fun or not so fun surprise at the end. I ordered some fruity beer which was $5 (not bad) the beer was actually pretty good. My partner ordered a long island which was the worst tasting long island i have ever had. It was a glass of sweet and sour mix and didn't even look like a long island. He said he was fine with it but i think he didn't want me to send it back. After finding out it was $11 he wished I would have.  We ordered the jalapeno burger and the Parmesan chicken. My burger was a 4/10. I ordered med/rare it came out medium and it seemed the meat was not seasoned at all. This was the first time I ever put salt on a burger. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good. I've had better at BK. The Parmesan chicken was dry and again under seasoned. 4/10 again not bad, but not good. We ordered chicken won-ton as an appetizer that for some reason came out almost at the end of the meal which the food runner was confused about and apologized for. I thought that they had been forgotten and didn't really want them at this point but we decided to try them as there were only 3. Cool, greasy, and soggy would be my definition of these. Overall I would like to give this place another shot because of the atmosphere. There is a really nice patio with a fireplace in the middle of tables.

We were seated after a 30 minute wait in spite of being told that it would be 15 mins!  The wifey and me both ordered the Rib Eye steak which came with a soup or a salad and we both had the salad which was fair.  After that it took well over 45 mins before our main dish came out.  My 14 oz steak was COLD and served on a tiny plate (I figured it would make my steak look bigger) but the annoying thing was that it was on a heap of fries so every time I tried to cut a piece of my steak I had to stop to rescue one of my fries from falling overboard!  Quite annoying to say the least.  Our waitress was so intense that we actually enjoyed having her as she reminded us of one of our crazy friends!  All in all it was quite an experience ....the patrons next to us were not as forgiving as us and had the manager over complaining about the time it took and the cold meal they had too!  The bill was comparable to the Grand Lux Cafe but unfortunately the food and service was a far cry from it!  I may return if the management stands us a complimentary meal.....but then maybe not!!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-coral-springs-2?start=220

Lunchtime, but there wasn't a wait and it wasn't overly crowded as one might think during what is otherwise a typical high peak time for lunch.  So it was very disappointing to be rushed through our meal by our server, complete with rude condescending looks and comments like ""Umm excuse me its a restaurant policy to drop the bill off"", when it appeared we were taking longer than she had liked for us to hurry up and ask for the bill.  Very rude!  What if we had wanted dessert? What (gasp) if we just were not ready for the bill because we did not want it yet since we were still eating with plates in front of us?!  Honestly, if we didn't have an appointment to be somewhere, I would have taken the time to report to management,however since I will not be back, figured it's more important to just rate it here and let you know food was delicious but good food can't over compensate for horrible, insulting service.  Especially at a brewery where you expect good times/service to go along with great food.   In looking at the other reviews, it seems there is much to be desired with the wait staff.  Maybe try another location or something since the food was pretty delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-coral-springs-2?start=220

He was a welcoming and had that type of ajar personality. The time it took for him to get our drinks was only 3:05 and that's pretty quick. I also think that the menu is fantastic and the food quality was pretty good.

Katelyn T.,"Pompano Beach, FL",68,110,10,1.0,8/22/2013,"Not impressed. This is maybe their first week so from seeing loads of cars parked out front since the opening, I figured we would go check it out. I have to say, the place looks like a step down from cheesecake or maybe looks like it could be part of that chain. Very nice starting with high hopes. Our server stated it was her first day and she was great! Now let me start by saying, there were six of us all coming from helping a friend move and was very hungry by 9 which was the time we got there. We ordered our drinks and appetizers and boy were there SO much to choose from, probably a little too much. Anyways, we got the combo app. and it was... interesting. It came with spring rolls, spinach dip&chips and mozzarella sticks. Food wasn't even fully cooked, the spring rolls were warm and a bit cold in the middle, spinach dip and chips... it literally was like Alfredo sauce and spinach and mozzarella sticks, well that was okay. Dinner came, once again our food wasn't fully cooked. One of my friends dishes were, not going to lie, it was cold in the middle. He proceeded to have them take it back and he didn't want anything after. His girlfriend got a pasta dish, the pasta was over done (hard/dry noodles) We got a manager and he was unpleasant and rude. But he said he'd take care of some of the meals. (50% off each meal) Desert, well the server knew we weren't happy and brought us a ""bazookie?""A cookie made in a pan type thing, well we got it and ONCE again.. not cooked. The cookie's ingredients were not even close to being done on one side. Not impressed at all! Before we left a few of us wasn't feeling too hot.

The mocktails are so sweet they're toxic, but in a good way like Britney Spears sings in the song of the same name. I found myself feeing like I was in the middle of a happy hour in a bar specialized in giving me happiness through their fruity virgin drinks. I ordered the sriracha Brussels sprouts and was delighted with the size and good taste for such a cheap price. The pizookie desserts are delicious and have the consistency of playdoh(again in a good way) with an amazing taste almost like that of cookie dough.

It's what someone should expect from a chain like Bj's and TGIF i guess. On the other hand, that pazookie was amazing! I love the contrast of warm and cold, and how the cookie is almost raw.... mmmm.  I would come back just for dessert, but then again, it's very busy for dinner so i'm not really sure if i would come back. EDIT: I'd also like to point out how i have come here for dinner before.

Just isn't me, particularly when dining out)Another time was the grand opening and we were kind of forced into our item. This time I went with high hopes and was let down. First of all the place is as dead, but for some reason it took at least 5 minutes for someone to seat us, and the person who sat us seemed annoyed that she had to. Once we were sat our drink orders were taken and then our server vanished. We closed our menus (signal for ""we are ready to order"") and waited. It took about 10 minutes to place the order. Once we placed the order it took almost 20 to get our food. And as I said before, the place was dead. Our server checked in once to see how we were doing then vanished again. We all finished our food and he finally appeared to ask if we have room for desert. We didn't, we were ready to go.  Overall the experience was very underwhelming. Nothing bad, but nothing to make me want to come back. If you have average food you need to have awesome service. If you have a heave service the food needs to blow me away.

They now use a sort of iPad to take orders, I assume to decrease the amount of error (which I find pretty cool). We each had a glass of wine and started off with the spinach and artichoke dip as an appetizer. It was a great size and came hot with a bunch of chips.  On the weekends they are running a new special which includes this double on the bone pork chop that comes with a honey mustard sauce on the side. My mom ordered that with two sides and it was delicious!  I had their sirloin with two sides and I thought it was rather yummy!

We sat for 14 minutes before being acknowledged by our server (she was not attentive until my muscular attractive brother showed up halfway through our meal.. and allllll of a sudden she realized the rest of the party existed..what a hot mess). Food was awful, lots of salt on already superbly salty chips that came with our spinach dip (they were old chips salted to the max n probably sprayed with pam as they left the kitchen bad..notice my emphasis on salt!).. Burger was bloody raw when my brother asked for well...now cmon i have seen a rare burger with more color & sear on it.. My meatballs and mash had already formed a skin on it..on both potato and the sauce covering meatball..just gross..why in gods name would you even serve someone this crap...i could never present anyone this plate of food...i immediately sent it back and was so turned off i couldn't dare order another thing for myself. Meanwhile my poor nephew is complaining the cheese on his pizza tastes funny..we all taste it and low and behold it actually did taste funny..he picks then eats only the pepperoni and disregards the rest. My hubby had a Tennessee chicken sandwich..dry as hell and just a overpriced KFC sandwich without the pizazz of KFC (and i dont care for KFC but they actually won this round..sadly and thats not saying much). The store smells of dirty mop, dirty rag, and humidity mixed with dirty dish water...POW it hits you as you go into the restaurant..i honestly had a bad feeling when the smell hit me before the shenanigans began and i should have just moved our party to chillis or someplace close by...im sorry to say but every person in my party had major complaints.. The only thing enjoyable, tolerable, and edible was the beer, my husbands side salad, my nephews pink lemonade...yup yess thats it!!!.

Britanee S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",76,73,538,4.0,12/15/2017,"Last night I stopped in for dinner for a Thursday night the house was packed. Upon signing in with the waitress she alerted us the wait would be about 15 minutes. That time seemed pretty fair to me so I grabbed a seat and waited. We waited no longer than about 5 or 6 minutes and were notified via text our table was available. While entering the restaurant and while sitting waiting for our table I looked around at the decor and building  architect which I found to be very nice. Its nicely built with a rustic feel to it. The colors are settling dark browns, deep mustard yellow, deep dark orange. Very settling and relaxing if you ask me. Decor defintely received 5 stars from me.  Once seated we were provided our menus and it was a very large one with many varieties. This in some cases can be bad or good depending on the person. For a drink I chose the special of the day Titos Vodka and pineapple juice and it was yummy. After we started off with calamari as an appetizer and this was indeed a great choice. After looking at the menu for a while to choose my dinner I finally decided on the Barbecue chicken deep dish pizza. The presentation was nice. The pizza its self pretty average. I was able to also taste some of the Ribs they have on special for thursday as well and they were pretty good. I shared a mini cookies and cream Pizookie and it was amazing. Totally a fan fave for me now, I cannot wait to try this again. Overall the food was pretty average for a restaurant so I would defintely rate the food 3 out 5 stars. My waitresses was very nice, friendly, accommodating, and attentive. She made sure to check on us quite often which sat very nicely with me since I've experienced it oh so many times how servers can leave you behind. Even as the night went on her attentiveness slowed down a little but it's totally understandable. I still would rate her a 5 out 5 just for her effectiveness. Its appreciated.  As far as pricing it is a wide variety which is very accommodating and affordable for everyone's lifestyle. I would like to go back and try this place again.

It was wayyy better than what I had before this. It was very flavorful and really Peruvian with the tastes. The shrimps were cooked perfectly. The spinach was okay not head other heels, it just added a different texture to the dish. A side of fries did not come with it I just asked for. The French fries were greatly salted and not soft which is a plus.  This is dish is....   Didi approved",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-coral-springs-2
Nancy M.,"Coconut Creek, FL",1143,607,3207,5.0,5/13/2017,"Arriving anywhere at 7 15 on a Saturday night the waits going to be murder. We called ahead and reserved a table so our wait was literally 5 minutes and the line was way out the door and the restaurant was filled to the brim. We were taken to a large crescent shaped booth and sat comfortably. We ordered drinks ( I had a Caribbean mai tai mule which was a rum based mule. It was so good, I had two!) I also had a spip of the orange creamsicle soda it was really great   . We also ordered appetizers which were the avocado egg rolls which are deep fried stuffed with avocado cilantro shredded carrots and red chilies which really gave it a kick. Those were my favorite. We also ordered fried calamari and for some reason it was warm not hot like it should have been (mine was kinda almost cold in my opinion) so when our waiter Alex asked how our appetizers were I said the calamari was cold. He immediately removed it and brought a fresh cooked order. Very cool of him to do and what was even cooler was GM Scott Goldman coming to the table to apologize for the med warm calamari and informed us it was taken off our bill. He didnt have to do that but that was a very classy move on the GMs part. Right there you could tell Scott takes pride in his restaurant and does an above superior job as GM. Thanks  Scott! For entrees we had the salmon and the Parmesan encrusted chicken. I had a taste of the chicken and it really had a crispy Parmesan crust that tasted delicious. Im on a diet and had the grilled salmon broccoli and rice. The salmon was absolutely fresh, grilled to perfection and was healthy. I loved my salmon. My ex fat lous mom was with us because this was like a pre mothers day meal. She had the salmon like I did and she had hers Cajun. Lou was the one who had the Parmesan chicken.  For dessert we had the chocolate chip macadamia nut cookie with ice cream on top (I had three teaspoons of that ,,1300 calories for the entire dessert so I thought I maintained some sort of diet mindset by only having a taste. It was really good, warm and the melted ice cream was the topping on the cookie (like the icing on the cake) and I loved it! I enjoyed my meal and I was treated so good here tonight I would definitely return! The menu was huge and there are so many other items I want to try. A great meal was had by all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-coral-springs-2

On arriving we were told that there was a wait for more than 1 hour. This was surprising because we could hardly see people waiting and they don't take reservations. We decided to go elsewhere and went back to return the buzzer. At this point we were told our table was ready. One hour to 5 minutes that's poor estimation. Anyways we were happy get a table without going elsewhere. We ordered beers and watermelon basil margarita. The cocktails were obnoxiously sweet and the beer was served after I got my entrees (which didn't come for an hour or so). In all disappointed on the drinks. For appetizers we ordered spinach stuffed mushroom (good), portebello strips (good) and honey glazed Brussel sprouts (decent). For entrees we ordered half a rack of ribs with chicken tortilla soup and side of fries. Crispy jalepeno burger with potato wedges (good). Tip: Go for wedges over fries. We ended up paying 50$ per couple with the coupon. It took 2.5 hours for the whole dinner and the service could be whole lot better.

First and foremost I really enjoy beer and this place has all the usual suspects lined up for the beer lover in all of us.  But look past the usual and you will find BJ's own brew.  Don't pass go, stop right there!  Try a sample of each one from the Blonde to the Tatonka and you will know why this place is just plain great! The best time to go is during Happy Hour.  That's when you can get some good deals. Last night we sat outside at the fire pit.  It was a bit chilly outside but the fire was really nice.  The service was ""ok"".  It wasn't busy outside and there were 3 servers.  Our server was nice but the service was a bit lame.  Took about 15 minutes to get drinks and about 40 minutes for the food to come out after we had decided to order.

What I should have done was save the $23 dollars I spent on this garbage. The pizza was not deep dish. It looked like when I called it in they got the frozen pizza out of the fridge, heated it and added some tomatoes on it. It was horrible to say the least. My friend who recommend the place was mortified as she took the 2nd bite out of this crap. I called to complain and you'd think they offer me my money back but no Stephanie the manager did absolutely nothing. The receptionist agreed as I explained how bad this pizza was as if she knew they had given me crap. The manager wanted me to come in the next day so I could give it one more try. No thanks!

We then realized, wow, it was taking a long time for the food. It was now 6:50.  No food, I flogged the waiter over and he laughed and said ""I don't cook the food, it's not me."". Then 10 minutes later the kid food arrived, 2 of the 4 were prepared incorrectly.  My wife went to the hostess stand and asked for the manager.  The manager told her she was checking on the food.  We are now 7:15 and the adult food comes out but only 3 of the 6 dishes, 2 of them were cold.  We never saw the other 3 dishes.  Still we have never had a manager visit the table. Just a sarcastic server who could no even be bothered to give us coaster or cocktail napkins so the drinks were sweating all over the table, I hate that.  We all looked at each other and decided to get up and leave.  I was so upset.  Everyone had to get their young kids home as it was a school night.  On the way out, I saw the manager and told her our experience was an utter failure.  You told me I was right and after a few seconds of awkward silence we left.  We had to grab a bit near our house way past our kids bedtime.  What a disaster.  We will never visit that restaurant again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-coral-springs-2?start=260

Nancy S.,"Boynton Beach, FL",0,11,9,3.0,7/12/2015,"We made sure to make a reservation for 7 people at 7pm for Sat night. When we arrived we were told that there was no reservation. At this point i asked if the young man if could accomodate 7 people because the restaurant didnt seem full yet. He said they could but we would have to sit immediately cause he couldnt hold the table for the rest our party to arrive. (It was about 6:45pm and there were just 2 of us at that point) We said that was fine and waited for him to put the tables together. At this point a young lady started trying to speak to us from the hostess stand... we were not sitting close enough to hear her. At this point i got up and moved to the hostess stand and she informed me that that could not hold the table for us. I was not understanding because the young man just told us that he was putting a table together. She stated that because our whole party wasnt present that she couldnt hold a table. I then told her thay we orginally made a reservation that wasnt honored and now she was telling me that we wouldnt get a table even though we were already there. I stated that not only did someone at her restaurant not establish our reservation, that we were told we could have a table that now would be given away if enough people came in before the rest of our party.(It still hadnt reached 7pm yet) She also told me that they wouldnt have been able to take a reservation cause the restaurant had been booked for days! I told her when we made the reservation the kady on the phone told us that they wouldnt be able to hold the reservation past 7:20pm... that there apparently was a 20 min grace period but for people already there we were givin no such curtosy. This young lady who never told me her name but said she was the manager was unwilling to help us. At this point we were watching at least 20 other people come in and be seated that did not have reservations. So we realized her statement earlier wasnt true. I was flabergasted at the rudeness and sheer unwillingness to simply help us eat and spend money in a restaurant she told me she managed. There were business cards of the manager on the hostess stand and i asked this young lady if this was her card and she said no. Like i said there were plenty of tables when we walked in that they were happy to seat other people who again did not have reservations in and make us wait. Thankfully she finally came over and said they would put a table together but wouldnt seat us until half our party was there. I said ok and the other person in my party thanked her. At which point (i kid u not) she stomped her foot like a petullant child and said ""is she going to acknowledge me"" (meaning was i going to acknowledge her). Im guessing my statement of ok wasnt enough. The young man we orginally dealt with seated us as soon as one more person showed up. I was wondering how they would count half being that would have been 3.5 people:)) Anyway, our first 15 minutes in this restaurant dealing with a person that is supposed to manage the staff and deal with customers was extremely dissatisfying. I can only hope that she gets some more training and hopefully deals with her staff with alot more common sense and grace than we encountered.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-coral-springs-2?start=260

Beth B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",3,23,2,1.0,1/30/2014,"Ugh... Disappointing 1/29/14 dinner. A birthday no less. We had high hopes, but to be fair,  had only reasonable expectations. Both were to be unmet.  We didn't ever turn into ""those diners"", we acted like we always do, like we want to be treated. Gave the benefit of the doubt, were always kind and considerate, even when issue after issue made the evening almost unbearable.What DID we choose to do? Laugh about it. And, thank god for the outlet-write a review. It's like having an extra $100 in your pocket when someone robs you, like they can't take everything from you-I still have my $100! So, here goes my $100 (AKA: my review):  *SERVICE: Very poor. Wait time told ""20min"". After 20 min., told ""oh, I meant 40min., so it's another 20 min."" Great when you have kids in your party. Awesome news.  Then when waiting at the bar AND when dining, apathetic waiter & bar staff. That's worse than bad if you ask me. Like getting served by a GHOST. They aren't even really there. A shell-in the way, unhelpful, space-taking, time-sucking, useless...But a shell standing between me and my sustenance! *FOOD: Ordered a build-my-own-pizza, clearly from the side of menu (& pointing to it!) not continuing any reference to Pan Pizza. The Waiter-giest didn't ask or clarify, nor did I think a need to, but he brought a deep-dish, greasy pizza. I simply and kindly mentioned that I was expecting a regular style crust and that perhaps I should have stressed that, to which his reply was a blank stare. I ate it with a smile. I reminded him of the side of marinara to dip-it-in that I'd asked for. My husband asked the waiter why his baked potato had nothing (let me clarify here, NOTHING) on it? The waiter didn't ask or clarify what may be available when my husband ordered it, just delivered it as plain as a baby's butt without comment. That item did go back to be loaded, but was sent with a smile. No complaints, we dug into the meal.  Overall the food was ala TGIFridays with a little (more) flair. Helpful? I think that's clear enough.  *ATMOSPHERE/EXPERIENCE: Very busy; Sports on big TVs, but not annoying like many places. The timing of our meal - was laughably poor. So bad, any frustration was waited through to where we could either have left OR stick it out and laugh about it (to ourselves of course, and now to you - bahaha!).  Although ordered at the same time, both some of our table's DRINKS and DESERTS were VERY - V.E.R.Y delayed. Perhaps there was an invisible extra person or two at the table that our waiter-geist could only see and he held those up for their slow-digestion? Not one apology or expression that any of the issues piling up as we dined was abnormal. Zero gratitude or uplifting smile from anyone, even thru our very kind, respectful manner towards our waitstaff (living or dead) smiling and being gracious for their hard work and our utter nonjudgmental manner towards them when it came to the worsening dining experience, of which I've only touched on major points here.  *BILL: excessive for what we got - very excessive for what we had to tolerate. Had the evening been as promised (what anyone living in or visiting the US and dining at a chain, self-professed higher-end, restaurant may expect when walking-in), we may not have felt as though was overpriced. Note-we always tip well, even when there is disappointment since we care how hard of a job waitstaff has get that tips are critical to getting by. Maybe it's also so we never walk away feeling like they can refer to us as ""one of those people"", even when we had one of ""those experiences"". I don't need to be haunted by any of waitergeist's friends from beyond, so I'll do my part and tip well to get out alive - and alone.   *WOULD I RECOMMEND IT? No. Not even to myself if it were a free meal and I hadn't eaten in 3 days. I'd rather eat ramen @home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-coral-springs-2?start=280

Cee D.,"Voorhees Township, NJ",50,13,,5.0,12/25/2014,"I'm really shocked at the bad reviews here. We ate here on Christmas Eve and had a great time and great food. The hostess was really nice and helped us get a table outside even though it was supposedly closed down for a big party. Our waiter Cameron was super nice and made spot-on recommendations for food. We started with a the vegetable and goat cheese flatbread and it came out fresh, piping out, and PHENOMENAL. It was honestly so good we ordered another one for takeout to eat on Christmas day. I got a salad for dinner that was also very good and stole some wedge fries from my husband's burger that were delicious. The best part was definitely the pazookie trio for dessert. We got oreo, chocolate chip, and salted caramel. They were all amazing but the oreo and salted caramel were really special. Being from a northern state we love to eat outside and the outside seating is very comfortable and the ambience is great.

Barry K.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,2,,2.0,3/6/2015,"First, the good news about BJs.  Went for an early weekday dinner, and service was excellent because it wasn't crowded.  The beer selection is terrific, and the salads were wonderful & plentiful.  So far so good.  Then came the entrees, and that's the bad news.  One person ordered a burger well done.  Huge mistake.  It was bone dry, devoid of flavor.  Two of us ordered the pepperoni deep dish pizza.  Another huge mistake.  The crust was limp & lifeless, there was hardly any tomato sauce, the cheese was overpowering, and there was so much pepper it was way too spicy.  It was certainly the worst excuse for deep dish pizza we've ever experienced, and maybe the worst pizza (any category) of all-time.  This was our first encounter with BJs, and we're willing to give it another chance, since the menu is big and there are lots of other choices.  So far, though, forget the burgers and forget the deep dish pizza.  Oh, well...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-coral-springs-2?start=280

Last time we went we were a group of 5 and each one of us ordered a different item on the menu and they were all delicious. The steaks are cooked as requested. Nothing to complain about here.

Heather C.,"Coral Springs, FL",0,34,30,4.0,9/6/2014,"BJ's has been my favorite restaurant since I moved to Coral Springs in January. Last night I was so excited to go because the last few new restaurants I tried sucked and BJs has ALWAYS satisfied me. Of course there's always a wait because it's very popular. I put myself on the call ahead list and after 30 minutes we were seated. After 15 minutes from the time we were seated we had not had 1 waiter come over to us and what really infuriated me was people that sat down after us were promptly served as soon as they sat. So I asked Donald, a waiter, if he could find out if we had a server at all. 10 minutes later, nothing. So I asked another server Ciara if she could send the manager. No manager ever came but Ciara said it was Donald's table but he said it wasn't. Thanks Donald. So Ciara said she would take care of us. She was amazing just like all the other servers I've had there previously. Instead of having our night ruined, she made it awesome and gave us free dessert at the end. My complaints here are that A) you have a terrible server working for you which is probably why you have so many bad reviews. B) the manager never came out which I think is highly disrespectful, especially when asked for. A good manager comes out to make sure everything is Ok. You failed. C) the only reason I'm giving you 4 stars is because Ciara was great.  Try a little more if you want people to come back. There are plenty of other restaurants to go to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-coral-springs-2?start=280

They start off attentive then eventually disappear , not to mention there's a ton of employees on the floor but no ones moving fast enough . The food is nothing great , which sucks because it was actually exciting to finally have a new restaurant in springs .  I ordered the unlimited soup and salad ... Wedge and clam chowder . My wedge salad was drenched in watery ass blue cheese that had like 2 crumbles of blue cheese , my clam chowder came out and it was warm, the consistency of it was thick (almost jello  like ) sooooo, I didn't eat it . Next I decided to order the piranha chili and a tomato and mozzarella salad ,which took for freaking ever ! I'm pretty sure the soups are pre made . pour that shit , scoop my salad and bam ...seems simple but not the case , lol . So the chili looked and tasted great. Only wish it had actually been hot so the cheese that comes on top could've melted when mixed and the big ass scoop of cold sour cream , wouldn't have made it colder than it was ! Tomato and mozzarella no complaints , needless to say , skip the soup and salad !  My friend ordered some stuffed mushrooms and well they were luke warm as also . Nothing comes out nice and hot , why!!??? Overall I'm not impressed and honestly prefer any other restaurant on university drive , especially Big Bear . Aside from the reviews, most people I've spoken to haven't liked it much either and said the service was terrible .

As I was waiting for my table I noticed two customers complaining about the service.  Not a good sign. After a while, it took a while for our waiter to show up. While we were waiting for our food, we overhead to table next to us complain about their meat being raw. My wife order a cobb salad to come with her meal. Her main dish came and no sign of the salad. She mentioned that to our waiter when he came to check on us (someone else brought the food) and she said she didn't want the salad anymore. He said he would take care of that and offer a free desert. He brought the salad anyway... I ordered the Black And Bleu flatbread appetizer, without onions (my thing... I don't like them). Unfortunately, my request was disregarded and the onions were there. I chose not to complain. It was just going to delay our dining experience. While we were waiting for our desert, we noticed another table in front of us with errors in their check. They waited a good amount of time for the waiter to come and fix it. They were pretty upset. When our own check came, the charge for the desert was there. We had to ask for it to be taken out. During this process, we just saw waiters and waitresses congregating around their service area, just chatting and leaving customers unattended.  Basically, the food is good but the store manager needs to keep a closer eye.

After tracking down our waitress since she disappeared for 20 min. We asked where our food was. Since it had been 45 min since we had ordered. She apologized to us,  telling us that she had a big baby shower she was also taking care of. Not my problem i thought to myself. She said our food was coming now. Well it came and along with my ribeye i also ordered asparagus and a baked potato. My asparagus was all dried out but I didn't say anything until i cut my steak. My steak was suppose to be medium it was more like rare. I asked for the manager. I explained to her how long we waited and the food still came out wrong. She also gave me the excuse of the server having been over loaded. Well then instead of thinking it i told her thats not my problem thats yours as a manager. She apologized and said she will take care of it. My steak comes back and now they served me the same steak they just threw it back on the grill. It looked like a lump of charcoal. And it was well done now. I called her back over and asked her if she was serious serving this steak to me. I said look at it. You gave me back the same steak and burnt it. She replied your right it is burnt but i disnt want you to wait any longer for your food. So i said i would rather a little longer and have my food correct then like you served me. So i had her just take the steak back and cancel my order. Then she replied like she was doing me a favor she will remove it from my bill. This was a pathetic display of management skills and making sure your customer is happy. I think its pretty pathetic that in a place like that there so called chefs cannot cook a steak correctly. I will never go there again. I just wish i would have taken a picture of the plate of food she delivered to my table. What makes it even worse is she was the manager.

I didn't even bother to try the food - I made an order for take out - asked a SIMPLE question, ""what is baja sauce?"" (for a burger) and was transferred to THREE people in an attempt to answer this basic question.  Hurriedly told the 3rd person not to bother and to just put it on the side.  I should have hung up then, it took over 10 minutes just to PLACE the order via phone! Made 2 orders for burgers with some minor customization (no cheese or mayo, add lettuce, tomato, substitute slaw for fries, etc - these are not crazy requests, just a little healthier than a ""normal"" order)...She read back the order THREE times and I ok'd it. I was told it would be ready curbside in 15-20m. I allowed just over 30, then when I arrived, did as instructed and called the number to tell them I was here and was told they had to ""check status"" and waited over 10 more minutes. Called back and was told it would be right out. Waited another 5.  Not at all surprised to find that the order wasn't even close to correct. Despite 3 repetitions and she and I reading the order back and forth, they managed to put things on that I specifically requested they leave off, and it looked nothing like what was pictured. Is it fair to picture something that looks perfect, vibrant and delicious - and then deliver something that looks like a cheap diner meal? The slaw - the buffalo burger is pictured with ""baja slaw"" (which is what I asked for) looks colorful and healthy with vibrant colors and a ""baja vinaigrette"" - which is what I asked for...the girl had no idea if there was more than one kind of slaw and had no idea what I was talking about. I was given a tiny container of something that closely resembles KFC's limp mayonnaise covered chunk slaw.  Congealed cheese and mystery orange sauce (perhaps the mysterious ""baha"" sauce), both of which I'd asked to skip, topped off this cold burger (probably b/c it sat around waiting for 30m) and some of the requested toppings were missing.

I dont know if people were expecting classy but the best way to describe BJs is that it is a relaxed atmosphere with a cheesecake factory sized menu of drinking/bar foods with custom brewed beers and lots of crafts. Many on tap like the always great Weiheistephaner HefeWeisse and others.

Lacey B.,"Lauderhill, FL",4,13,6,3.0,1/23/2015,"Walking into the restaurant, I really wanted to like this place. I really did. I hadn't seen my best friend in months, and I was excited for something different that could make up for all the hipster restaurants that we have in Miami. We were seated immediately, at a tiny table for two right by the door. We sat, and we looked at each other and we looked next to us at the open tables that were a little bigger and not as undesirable as this one was. I approached the hostess, and she told me that we could move, so we get up, and we're moved to the other side of the restaurant.... to the same sized table, and to the same awkward openness. Our server Greg was friendly, he recommended a couple of things and put up with the weird way we ordered. We tried the corn fritters which were heaven, the carnitas fries, which were kind of boring and could use a nice refreshing sauce, the California club flat bread which was delicious, but lacking in topping and way too crisp to eat without making a mess, the calamari, which was served on a plate about 12 inches long, with the actual calamari taking up only six of those, and the other six occupied by two little containers of sauce and two slices of lemon...... the presentation was lacking to say the least. The dish that was the end all, that really made us never want to come back was the pepperoni pizza dippers. We were so excited to have something really good and when it arrived, to say the least, we were disappointed. It came with sliced bread sticks that were stale and gross, and the flavor of the actual dip, was just not what either of us were hoping for. It wasn't cheesy, it was just rich in cream cheese and had no extra flavor. They might as well have given me a bagel for dipping it had so much cream cheese in it. The former mac and cheese saved it for us, as well as the corn fritters. We ended up having dessert, but we're really disappointed when we saw they only have pizookies  for dessert, which is kind of stupid since there's a big variety of everything else. Anyways, the dessert ended up being okay, definitely recommend the cookies and cream and the salted caramel ones.

Stephen C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",182,172,626,2.0,9/27/2014,"Went to this restaurant about 2 months after opening which is a decent amount of time to iron the kinks out.  While I must say my experience with the customer service was great, I can't say for the food.  Hands down the decor and design of the Resturant is very nice. The night we went was a Saturday so it's expected this place would be busy as it was.  Our wait was about 35 minutes which was decent for the amount of people it did help the wait that the staff was walking around serving samples of their pizza which was great and they were not stingy with the samples either.  We were so tempted to order a pizza which I wish I would have but after seeing the menu and having a taste for a steak that was my choice.  I was very disappointed with the quality of the steak mainly because there was  significant amount of fat on the steak and it was not exactly cooked properly.  I would have sent the steak back but at the point I discovered the fat I had ate a little over a quarter of the steak and decided to let it be.  The sides I had were ok nothing to brag on but decent.  My fiancé stated her food was ok and she was not impressed and would not go back.  I am willing to give a place a second try but I have spoken to other people that stated the same the pizza was good but the other food was ok.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-coral-springs-2?start=240

For desert we had a cookies and cream pizookie ( they combined pie and cookie) and man was it fresh and delicious.

Our waitress kept coming by & checking to see it our food came out & when she didn't see it, she'd run to the kitchen to check. She then got a manager involved & finally our food arrived. He apologized & said he would comp our dessert. I told him that I thought the entire meal should be comped because of the extremely long wait & he said he had to check with another manager. She then came out & told us that they would only buy us dessert. We then got a teeny, tiny $3.95 pizookie as compensation! What a joke! I can't blame the waitress who tried to help, but the kitchen & the management better get their acts together!

Sean C.,"Plantation, FL",63,11,4,1.0,8/23/2015,"My wife and I received some wonderful news Wednesday August 19, 2015 and wanted to celebrate and decided to try this restaurant out for the first time. Well needless to say we had a HORRIBLE experience and will never go back to this place ever again! We were greeted within a timely fashion and sat down and ordered drinks right away. Our server was amazing she helped me order one of the specialty craft beers and was very knowledgeable about the beer selection. This was NOT our horrible experience. The service from our waitress was amazing and this review had nothing to do with her directly. This review sorry has to do with the food and the management staff of this establishment! My wife and I ordered calamari and baked mac and cheese for an appetizer. The calamari came out burnt cause the oil in the dryer hadn't been changed in days and when I began to eat it I found myself almost choking on a piece of plastic. The waitress was there at the table when this happened and was completely professional and apologetic about this and asked if we wanted a new order. She quickly went to the kitchen and had them rush a new order for us. While we waited we began to eat the Mac and cheese we ordered which by the way was basically soup, noodles and some store bought bacon bits. The new order of calamari came to the table and surprise surprise it was the same thing.. Burnt and greasy!!! Then our entrees come out.. I had the newest burger on the menu. A brisket, bacon bbq burger which I ordered Medium (as I do with every burger) and low and behold it was a hockey puck!! WELL DONE!!! My wife got the fish and chips and just like the calamari, it was burnt, greasy and the batter on the fish was horrible.. No seasoning no flavor!! The fish inside the batter had a smell that no whitefish of any kind should have. My wife eats fish often enough to know that wasn't 100% safe to eat. We did see the server talk to the manager but not once did he come to our table to try and make corrections or even see how the meal was. The management staff acted as though it was inconvenient to stop by our table. Needless to say, if you haven't guessed it by now we will never go back to this restaurant ever again!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-coral-springs-2?start=240
Ben D.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,13,,2.0,10/10/2013,"So we went for my wife's birthday and looking forward to the latest restaurant in Coral Springs. The positive.......large, open, clean and great attentive service. The beer is excellent. Out of all the brewery restaurants that claim to brew in the style of the masters, they got it pretty close. The not so positive......food. The first warning was the shear amount of items offered along with the themes of food. They offered Pot Roast to Jambalaya. Asian to American bistro. Pizza to Poke. I thought, how can they offer this variety and in mass quantity and still be profitable. My theory was soon confirmed. My wife and her sister had the chicken and pasta, brother-n-law had the Pot Roast and I had a burger with wedge fries. I can sum up the details of every dish by saying everything originates from the term ""Food Product"". It is either from frozen or from a bag. I don't know if that is the truth, but that's what my taste buds tell me. The $225 bill for four makes the failure to meet expedition sting a little bit worst.

The atmosphere was great, the building is well designed, and the bar is definitely attractive as soon as you walk in. They had a great drink selection, I tried the prickly peach sangria, it was okay a little on the strong side and little bit too much sour mix, I added some sprite and it was good.  The root beer they make there was delicious and creamy. For appetizers we had the Ahi Poke, it's diced ahi tuna with crispy wontons. It was delicious and the tuna was very fresh and I was a big fan of the wonton crisps.  For the entree we had the deep dish chicken bacon ranch pizza and I enjoyed it. It was nice and crispy and full of flavor!  For dessert we had the macadamia nut cookie with vanilla ice cream, I believe it's called the POOZOKIE. It was pretty awesome. Overall I enjoyed my experience and I'll definitely be returning. I would've given it 5 stars the only issue I had was the server wasn't too knowledgable about things on the menu when we asked questions but overall he was nice and the service was pretty good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-coral-springs-2?start=240

It was exceptionally fruity and did not taste like cider, but it was good to drink. I ordered the calamari (Seafood Lover) and it looked every impressive when it came out, but when I ate it, it needed salt! The calamari was not crispy at all and I ate all of it because I was starving and could not wait (or else I would send it back!) My friend had 2 blondes. The service was confusing. My first server was very nice and knowledgable, but it got confusing when different servers came up to ask if we had ordered. Then my server came back and stated that his shift was over and this was our new server. If he was going to get off in 10 minutes he should of let her take the table early or have the manager come over and ask serve us until our server came. Then a new server came over and explained that she was our server so I was confused. If the service was up to par and the calamari was flavored correctly and crispy, it would have gotten a 5.

Athena C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",27,22,1,1.0,3/15/2015,"Ok so upon arriving we were told a 1 hour wait. Didn't look that crowded but we chalked it up to being a Saturday night. Wrong it was because service was slow. We actually get called earlier and thought ambiance was pretty cool so we felt good and ready to order. Our waiter was brand new only 3 weeks in. Kind of strange they would put him on a Saturday night but he was trying his hardest to get it all right so I'm not mad at him......entirely. First question I asked was "" what's good here?"" He tells me, ""well we are known for our pizza and beer so yeah "" um ok. I have an encyclopedia of a menu in front of me and only thing that's good here is pizza? Well he was actually right because our food sucked and we didn't have pizza. I wanted ribs they didn't have. My son wanted cheddar mash they no longer served that even though it's still on their menu. The appetizer we ordered was supposed to be nachos. They were frito chips with crap on top. Gross. We got our drinks and my 5 yr. old was thirsty watching us drink because the guy forgot his drink. For like 30 minutes. Not kidding. My other son asked for a refill and never received. We were there for over 2 hours! I ordered a rib eye cooked medium. It was the dryest steak I ever had in my life. The waiter offered me A1 and forgot to bring it. My steak was halfway done and stuck in my throat by the time he came back. My mash potatoes felt like cafeteria mash. It was clear our food had been sitting out forever. My husbands sauce for his pork chop wasn't even a sauce by the time it came out. It looked like poop. I have pics don't worry. The kids meal didn't come with cheese for the burger so we requested it when we first ordered. My son was done with one of burgers before waiter brought out a slice of cheese. He charged us a dollar for that cheese too. I forgot to mention our food didn't come out at same time. 2 people were eating 10 min before everyone else then another meal then few min after the rest. We spent over a hundred bucks and left so unsatisfied and unhappy. It's just unbelievable to me how bad a place can actually be. I try and give benefit of doubts which is why I don't totally fault our waiter because he is only 3 weeks in but unfortunately our experience here has been the worst I have ever had at a restaurant hands down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-coral-springs-2?start=200

We ended up making a reservation and coming in on a Friday night. My friends were so impressed. They had the table ready when we got there. Our server was Sydney and she was lovely.

Shari H.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",12,8,,4.0,11/20/2013,"My fiance and I visited this restaurant on a Thursday night for dinner.  When we arrived, I was already aware of the open seating on the patio and so we requested and sat at a table on the patio.  It was a little chilly out but we went ahead and ordered drinks and appetizers to begin.  This was my fiance's first visit and my second.  The drinks were good and the apps were fantastic, as I knew they would be.  It got a little chillier than I expected and our server, John was gracious enough to find us a table inside and help us relocate,much to the chagrin of one of the hostesses who was not pleased with this change.  We sat inside for a while before our new server attended to us which was a little off-putting after the prompt service we had received from John on the patio.   BTW, John wasn't even supposed to be our server on the patio, but saw that the assigned server was a little behind and decided to be proactive and pick up our table so we wouldn't have to wait. The entree was okay.  We ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken and a lemon chicken pasta dish.  There was way too much sauce on the pasta dish and the parmesan crusted chicken was a little bland.  It actually tasted much better the next day!  All in all, the apps at BJs are fabulous, drinks are great.  Jury is still out on the entrees.  I'll try it again before making a final decision.  Service is outstanding!  Kudos to John!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-coral-springs-2?start=200
Sierra K.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",139,205,40,1.0,9/23/2013,I wasn't impressed. This place is always packed because the people of coral springs never leave. It is the new hot spot because of size and abundance of alcohol. The food is not that good and service sucks.The waitresses were clueless about the type of beers. The place was not intimate and I felt like I could hear most peoples conversations.  Would only go back if it was empty and I had no where else to go.  Typical sports bar. That makes about five in coral springs. I really wish there were other places to go than the endless sport bars that all serve the same food. The waitresses know they will get business and act like they don't need the money.(again because coral springers never leave the area)  MEh.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-coral-springs-2?start=200

Mary P.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,3,,1.0,2/13/2014,"Worst service ever. I called on Wednesday to make reservations for 9 on Saturday, and the ""manager"" who took care of me over the phone said they didn't take reservations until 9:30, but that I could go earlier and they will put me in the waiting list as a walk in. Which I did when I got to the restaurant at 6:19. I explain this to the host in the front and she said no problem that still might take about an hour to hour and a half (that was ok to me). An hour later I come back to the front and I asked them if they could add 1 more person so instead of 9 we would be 10 and also asked how much longer was it going to be. Their answer was that we were going to be seated at 9:30 bc my reservation was a that time (that same person didn't put my party in the wait list, she automatically pulled a reservation that apparently the manager put on the computer even when he said I could walk in). I spoke to the manager and explain the situation to him (very nice tall skinny guy, can't remember his name). We expecting to have a better night sat down to have some appetizers and drinks.  Cynthia was hour server, she looked inexperience, everything was taken way too long.  We even asked another server what was going on, why was it that even to get a drink was a nightmare and he said ""the service here is the worst, I'm sorry you have picked this place for your reunion"". We decided to pay our tabs and just go to another restaurant. But the nightmare didn't stop there, Cynthia gave us a crazy bill whit things twice more times than they were supposed to so we told her to verified it and make different receipts so the birthday guy didn't have to pay (that was terrible) she got more confused so she had to call another manager to fix it for her, we waited for about another hour between they could clarify the account, corrected and we could pay.  This last manager has a 2letters nickname (AJ, JC) something like that.  First time there and the worst experience ever.  Manager, hostess and servers need training.  They didn't even made the attempt to make us feel better and stay.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-coral-springs-2?start=340

When we got the beer one person liked it the other thought it was not good. We exchanged it for another terrible tasting beer... The food arrived and 5 of the 6 meals were ok. The enlightened turkey burger was under cooked. Almost raw inside. By the time the waitress returned most of the people finished eating so it was returned for a credit. I would have been ok with returning the food and exchanging it for something else but the waitress wasn't coming back to the table. We ate there on a Thursday evening.

The first three weeks was impossible to get in this place without a 2 hour wait on weekends. We were dying to try it out, we figure it must be terrific.  We finally got to go on a Sunday afternoon. Its a big place.  The hostess told us that our waiter/waitress would sign us up for the rewards program. We asked our waiter. He did not want to be bother and told us to go to the website and sign up. The menu is American Pub basic fare.  The beer was good. We ordered clam chowder soup, Turkey sandwich came with french fries (McDonalds type) and Crispy over fried calamari.  The quality of the food is mediocre. They are trying to imitate Cheesecake Factory (far from).  Our waiter mix our checks with another table, when we call it to his attention. He took the check left, came back with the same check and told us that the other table had paid our check and he could not re-do it without getting in trouble. Told us to take out of his tip. It was a $3 difference our loss between our check and the other table. We paid it and gave him a tip. I was not in the mood of arguing and did not want him to get in trouble. However, looking back we should have asked for a manager.  We decided, we will not be back. Not worth it. I lived in this town for many years and have seen restaurants come and go.

Melanie J.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,4,,1.0,8/26/2015,"So, I first ate at BJ's when I lived in Gainesville. That BJ's is amazing and has excellent service! I loved everything about BJ's. That being said, I was so excited when they started building one in Coral Springs. After they opened, I ate dinner there. The service was terrible and I waited months to go back thinking it was because they were so new they just weren't quite ready yet. I waited and waited and one day decided to go back. Well, the second time was no better. My family member's food was made wrong and the service sucked. That last experience was probably about 3-4 months ago. Today a friend of mine says, ""hey, let's give BJ's one last shot."" Reluctantly, I agree. Third times the charm, right? Wrong! We went for lunch and the place was only about a third of the way full. So you would think there would be good service, right? Wrong again! The service was terrible. I literally saw staff just standing around chatting among themselves as I waited forever for my drink and salad. I ordered chili- it was cold, not even luke warm. My friend ordered pizza, it came out cold. For dessert, we ordered a pizookie trio. Well, turns out they were out of the cookie and cream flavor we ordered, and they decided they would just chose another flavor for us without asking. Turns out, it was a flavor we don't even like. The waiter didn't even care. He just left it. Then to top it off, it was obvious the pizookies had been sitting awhile before they were brought to our table. The ice cream on each one was completely melted and falling over the sides of the pizookie container. Even worse, the pizookies weren't even hot!!! This, after we waited for 30 minutes!  All this to say, I will never go back. The service is always terrible and the food is always cold.

Be careful if you sit near the bar because you might get frostbite.  Server was nice but he gave us the hard sell on things like their rewards card and appetizers and drinks. Eventually we asked him to move us to another table and he found us a table outside on the patio. Much warmer.  The food was okay. Kids mac & cheese was bland but kids pasta was good. Turkey burger melt wasn't anything special. Wife's salad and flatbread was just okay.  To get the kids mac & cheese off the final bill the server had to find the manager who then had to come out and give us a visit before taking it off. He was friendly and nice but the whole process took an unnecessary 15 minutes.  Next time we'll go to Bru's Room.

We started with calamari appetizer. The squid was crispy and delish. I like the two dipping sauces as well. I ordered parm crusted chicken and thought it was great. Nice portion, moist and crunchy goodness. My son ordered the fried chicken, and he liked it as well. My daughter had the honey lime scallops, which i tried, and they were well seared, with a nice spicy sweet finish. Her rice side was ordinary and a bit bland though. Onto dessert. We ordered the pizzookie trio, three different cookies, warm with ice cream on top. We loved it! I had a cup of coffee and we were out the door for $66 plus tip. A decent value these days i think.

We placed the order at around 8:15 pm. I called the location after I received my order conformation to just be sure they received it. I was told no abruptly and to call back in 15 minutes. After closer review of my order conformation it stated I placed the order at 9:00pm and that it was actually for Nov 17 at 9:15pm. When I called back to inquire about this I was put on hold for another five minutes, only for the girl to come back on the phone and tell me that she spoke to her manager and that just couldn't be possible maybe I did something wrong. They took my order over the phone and we went to pick it up. I at that time told the employees at the take out counter that maybe there was a glitch in the system and they should have someone look into it. I was again told that could not be possible. Not to mention the lack of service, but the food was sub par as well. The burgers we ordered were dripping with grease and soggy bread. I really wanted to like this place but that won't be possible.

Zen B.,"Pompano Beach, FL",93,3,,1.0,12/28/2013,"Went there on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and the pizza they brought out was not cooked all the way through. They then brought the manager over for a horse and pony show that we didn't ask for. After explaining what went on he took the raw pizza and said we will make you a new one.....after waiting about 20 minutes, they finally brought out a new pizza. Yes it was cooked all the way though.....BUT....it was COLD! The deep pan that is supposed to be scalding hot was cold! If I was the manager and had unhappy guests I would have made sure that was the best damn pizza they ever had. Especially after being told they were getting 2nd shot at impressing an already unimpressed skeptical patron. Guess my idea of ""good service/good food"" and BJ's are a little different. This is very similar to the last time I ate there. They have no concept of food quality control in the kitchen. It takes more than a nice looking place to stay in business. The bottom line is the food has to be good and the service has to match. BJ's has neither of these in place.  And to boot, the hostess couldn't have been less friendly.  I will be spending my hard earned money else where....I suggest everyone do the same.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-coral-springs-2?start=320
