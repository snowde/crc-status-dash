Sanford L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,20,1,5.0,11/29/2017,"I am never disappointed in BJ's service and food.  I eat at the one in Coral Springs Fl. and the one in Daytona when we are up there to visit. The Pizza are great, and there Deep Dish Ziti, you have to try it,  GOOD TO THE LAST BITE! The staff are friendly and helpful.

Nora M.,"Port Orange, FL",163,156,573,4.0,11/7/2017,"I like this place, it's like good bar food. And their pizza is one of my favorites, especially the buffalo chicken one. Yumm. And they are the best during happy hour. Mon-fri: 3-7 & Sun-mon: 10-close in the bar area. Most of the appetizers, flatbreads and mini pizzas are half off. And I love appetizers, so I usually order 3-5 of those and get to take some back home with me. With the huge verity for a foodie lover, I'm happy. lol The atmosphere is pretty nice and casual. And it's great for meeting up with friends.  I'm a regular here, and I recommend that u try it at least once.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-daytona-beach-2
Tari T.,"Orange City, FL",11,26,4,5.0,10/2/2017,"The decor is as provocative as the menu. Lots to look at and talk about. The hostess greeted us with a smile and the VIP question. Seems if you sign up with the app you can earn points. And with our first time trying and signing up with the app we gots us some freebies! Hubs got the portobello mushroom burger and he was near tears. His burger came with a as-big-as-his-burger mushroom on top, which was grilled to perfection. I got the buffalo bbq burger and it was amazing. Our beers were dark; Porter and Tatonka.  Both amazing. Porter was smooooth. Tatonka was a smidgeon sweet but hoppy. Loved them both.  Our freebie was the Pizookie. Salted Carmel. But the choices were difficult. Monkey Bread Pizookie would be our next pic. But there's something for everyone. OMG amazing!  Taylor our server was the best. We couldn't make up our mind about the dozen choices in beer and she let us test a little shot of them. She was friendly and helpful and just a joy to chat up.  For our freebie dessert we chose the Salted Carmel Pizookie. There are just no words for how awesome it was.  The place was clean and comfortable. This was a delightful experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-daytona-beach-2
Stef B.,"Ormond Beach, FL",51,73,93,5.0,9/3/2017,"I came here for dinner one night because I heard great things about this place - I was excited to try since we have none in NY. It was pretty busy for a week day night but my dad and I got seated right away. The inside has lots of seating available. Between my dad and I, we got beverages, two entrees and dessert and it all cost us under $40. I was prepared and had a coupon for a free entree with purchase of 2 beverages. Check out their website before coming here because they will post coupons and specials that they have. The food was better than I imagined. Several vegetarian options - I got the veggie tacos with a grain salad - so delicious and fresh. My dad got a chicken dish which he really enjoyed.  Then of course we had to end the night with a trio of pizookies (that's what everyone comes for). We got the chocolate chip, peanut butter and the monkey bread. Each one is topped with ice cream as well. My dad and I surprisingly liked the monkey bread the best. Overall, great food, excellent service and environment, and fair prices if you come when there are specials. I definitely will be coming back again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-daytona-beach-2
Don V.,"Hinckley, OH",0,8,4,2.0,1/5/2018,"Went with local Daytona Beach friends who recommended BJs. Not that impressed  My BJ draft beer had a good flavor but was flat.  Our friends burger patty was so thin we joked that it was like 4 White Castle patties connected together.  Each meal of four came out at a different time.  Food tasted OK, but nothing I'd rush to have again. After 4 weeks dining around the area, this was the low point.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-daytona-beach-2

Christopher C.,"Conshohocken, PA",168,1318,6419,3.0,6/6/2017,"While I'm not a huge believer in Gordon Ramsey, I do buy into one of his most basic ideas that you see him talk about on TV all the time.  It's really hard to be all things to all people when it comes to a restaurant menu.  Better to do ten things well then do a hundred things half-assed.   Clearly BJ's didn't read that memo because it's a little weird to be given a menu that has page numbers on it due to the sheer size/volume of what your being handed.  This is the War and Piece of restaurant menus.  I don't know how many entree items are on the menu but I read an article online that said the chain cut just their entrees down from 181 to 150 three years ago.  150!  And that's just the entrees!  Holy Crap! So we came in just before nine on a weeknight and overall the restaurant was fairly dead.  Lots of TV's everywhere with everything on them from college baseball to hockey to basketball.  Add in music turned up fairly loud and ripping A/C and this is definitely not a spot that you're going to be having a quiet intimate conversation at. The best part of the meal was the service.  It was solid from front to back.  I chalk part of that up to the restaurant being dead but overall our server was very good.   As for the food: Spinach and Artichoke Dip - Overall fairly flavorless.  Lots of chips while the dip was mostly a greasy/oily/room temperature/flavorless mess. Small Cheese Pizza - This is the ultimate ripoff at over eight dollars.  Four small micro slices.  In the real world you could get a pizza twice the size for the same price. Cherry Chipotle Glazed Samon & Spicy Peanut Chicken with Soba Noodles - The people who ate both of these were very happy with both the flavor and the large portion size. Shrimp & Asparagus Penne - You would think that these things would work well together but honestly I'm not so sure about that.  The marinara sauce is so strong, acidic and bitter that you can't taste anything else.   The other issue here which needs to be discussed are the prices.  The food is way, way overpriced for what it is.  Like I referenced earlier, over eight dollars for a small four slice pizza with the other entrees being over sixteen dollars a piece.  I guess that would be good if everything were great but it's not.  Some portion sizes are really large while others are very small.  Some things have good flavor while others taste like nothing.  That's a lot of dough for food which is this uneven. Within the last year close to home a BJ's opened up about thirty minutes away.  I haven't been there yet and honestly after seeing what this location is about I'm good with not hurrying over because the menu prices are high for what you get and I honestly think that they would be smart as a chain to cut down maybe half the menu. While not horrible, our experience at BJ's wasn't a great value either.  Three stars all the way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-daytona-beach-2

I do like the modern bar. They have an extensive specialty cocktail and craft beer menu. Even though I didn't try anything, they all looked interesting. They can make almost anything vegetarian, if you ask. We shared a vegetable flatbread. It was okay. I think I would re-order it next time I visit.  We paired it up with a super salad.

Patricia L.,"St. Augustine, FL",259,244,1445,5.0,8/20/2016,"We love BJ's!  We love the atmosphere, the menu, the wait staff and the prices!  This place is huge, so even when the parking lot looks full...you can probably still get a table.  Don't forget they have a more than ample bar! We normally try things from the Small Bites Menu since we normally only need something small when we go there.  Everything is delicious.  Our personal favorite is the Honey Sriracha Brussels Sprouts.  I love Brussel sprouts anyway, but to take a perfectly healthy item and make it so ""apply to the thigh good"" is amazing!  Even if you don't like these normally...give them a try, you'll get addicted!  We get them every time we go! On our last visit we ate a little more than normal...again!  My husband had a burger with fries and our son had a cheeseburger...both were absolutely delicious!  Their fries rock!  I, however, had a pizza and it was amazing! The wait staff is wonderful and perfectly attentive. They seem to have that perfect ""thing"" down to make sure you are never on empty drink wise.  And they don't come to see how your meal is when your mouth is full.  BJ's everywhere seems to have this in common. OK...drum roll...they give a uniformed discount and they have a free rewards program.  Both are reasons alone to return again!  Of course we'll be back...we love the Honey Sriracha Brussels Sprouts too much to not go back.

Woody W.,"Ormond Beach, FL",0,9,,2.0,6/18/2017,"We are big BJ's fans and have enjoyed many a visit - including last year at this very location on this very day - Father's Day. I wish that were true this year, but it's not.  Where to start - we had to wait 15 minutes despite there being ample empty tables - and arriving at about 445 pm (pre-dinner rush). Once seated, we enjoyed reviewing the menu, and again, and again, and again. It took. I less than 10 minutes to get just our drink order taken... not to mention another 10 to get the actual drinks.  We ordered an appetizer at the same time as our meal - because we'd had plenty of menu review time. Strongly recommend the Brussel Sprouts!  Half of our table was served about 5 - 8 minutes before the other half. And, it was the adults served first - a big mistake than anyone who has ever even been near a child knows. But, at long last we all had ""food."" I use quotes because my son's and I who each had burgers enjoyed something more of a charcoal briquette on a bun - well-done ain't got nothin' on these burgers!  We got to listen to the table behind us complain about speed and quality and got to watch the manager do virtually nothing about it - look no further than her for this locations speed and quality issues. Folks will follow a leader and rise to meet their expectations - but this leader wasn't leading.  We had to wait for drink refills (iced tea and water - not exactly complicated) twice during our meal. And, our salad/appetizer dishes were left at the table until we asked for it to be removed well after main dishes arrived. We never did get empty glasses removed from the table - they just kept stacking!  We ordered dessert because their Pizookies are awesome. And we were greeted by our bill before we even got dessert delivered to the table. They made a huge to-do about getting our rewards information before we were seated, but didn't ask to use this before bringing the bill.  We will be back to a BJs, but not this location.  And if you get sat in Lora S's section - grab a newspaper, because you are gonna wait! After we settled-up, I asked to speak with the manager, Vivian. I reviewed the entire contents of this review with her. She acknowledged these were problems and let me know that she ""just needs to give her servers some extra help tonight."" At no point did she offer to make things right or repair the relationship with this customer. As I said before - very poor leadership that results in very poor service and quality.

Not only was the food slow. It was wrong all attempts and they never got the meal correct.  And knowing this, no manager ever came out nor was our raw pizza (after 2nd attempt and over 45 mins.. we boxed it up) comped.  Don't expect the food to be what the menu says.

I was almost speechless while eating my Kale & Brussels sprout salad the explosion of flavors was amazing!

Matt F.,"DeLand, FL",6,64,11,2.0,3/5/2017,"I'd never been to BJ'S before but my wife had raved about the Oviedo location so I figured we'd give the one in Daytona a try. I'm giving two stars instead of one because of the BJ'S phone app which allows you to schedule on the wait list via phone and our flatbread pepperoni appetizer which was pretty tasty. Everything else went downhill from there.  First our server took ten minutes to get to our table, slow service and not very busy so I was surprised by that. We ordered and had a pretty decent appetizer but our dinners were another story entirely. My wife and I ordered prime rib sandwiches with fries. They were very small and just meat, nothing else. The fries were buried in salt. Now I like salt. I use it all the time but between the massive amount of salt on the fries, sandwich and au jus it was almost inedible. I actually left food on my plate and this was a small order that cost me $16.  My son ordered a burger which came out prepared incorrectly. My wife and I are done and my son still hasn't eaten. After 15 minutes a new burger comes out burnt and nothing melted on it. We asked for a manager at this point. The manager was apologetic and comped the burger, appetizer and threw in two desserts. I'm glad because those meals, drinks and appetizers which were sandwiches and fries would have cost us 67 bucks not including tip.  Our server, by the way, never refilled our drinks. I had to ask another server to do that. The table next to ours  gave up on getting service and walked out.

The calamari was tender and fried perfect, the shrimp tacos were filled with shrimp the shrimp were rather small but plentiful the other ingredients seems fresh and they were assembled very neatly not thrown together.

Aisha A.,"Deltona, FL",28,21,8,1.0,5/11/2016,"i went to this location on Saturday 5/7 with a group of 12. Let's just say from the minute they seated us things were off to a bad start. First off, they wanted to seat 12 people plus a baby sling at a table for 8. They then open the flaps for the table and add 4 inches making another attempt to seat us there. Mind you this was around 1030PM and there were probably only 4 other tables of guests. Then they gave us a server who was highly incapable of taking orders and bringing our food to the table in a timely manner. She would bring 2 or 3 appetizers out at a time right after the previous set of plates were empty. In this case, we werent really able to eat as a group and some of us ended up waiting for others to get their food to the point where ours was so cold it was inedible. We are very unsure of what her issue was with getting drinks but everytime someone asked she'd either ignore them to where we would have to hunt her down for a refill or take the glass with a pompous attitude and roll her eyes before coming back to slam the glass on the table to show how annoyed she was. She miswrote two of the orders at our table and when approached about it she just looked at us like we were speaking an alien language to her and she did not know what was going on. No apology or anything. Upon bringing the new meals back she had so much attitude dropping it on the table she almost hit the guest in the side of her face with the bowl. At this point I was highly irritated and could not deal with her snobbiness any longer. I requested to speak to a manager. I have never seen someone learn their please and thank you that quickly! The manager came over, comped two meals and that was about it (we didnt care to have anything comped but if you dont like to serve people then just dont do it!) Now comes time for our checks. You'd think it would be a breeze? It took her 1 hour to print 7 checks. Not to mention 3 of them came back wrong twice and 1 out of those 3 came back wrong 3 times. I feel sorry for those in my group who paid via card. You should have seen how fast this girls hand kept swiping one card again and again at the POS.

Yarko K.,"Toledo, OH",22,62,27,3.0,2/16/2016,"We come down every year for the Daytona 500, and BJ's has become a trusted place for good food. Normally, they tick all the marks, this year, not so much. While we did stop in the week prior to the race, it was not even close to packed, so our experience cannot be chalked up to an overwhelming amount of customers.  The root beer glazed ribs appetizer were delish. Sweet and tangy, with just the right amount of heat. Yum! Their flatbread pizza appetizers are normally homeruns, especially the really unique ones (sadly several have been dropped from the menu) but this time we stuck with the tried and true pepperoni extreme. Unfortunately it was extremely blah. Couldn't make out the different cheeses, and the pizza itself wasn't crisp. The crust wasn't raw, it just wasn't thin and crispy.   As for our entrees, another ""meh"" performance. The spaghetti and meatballs were good. The meatballs tasty and well seasoned (love that they include some Italian sausage), the sauce decent. My companion had teh ham turkey club ... what a disappointment. The lettuce was limp, edges were browning (UGH). The tomatoes were tasteless, and the entire sandwich was soggy. Bummer, because the sourdough bread had great potential, but it was too soggy to enjoy. I'm afraid BJ's is slipping into the rut of chain restaurant mediocrity, which is a shame.

Instead of rare to medium rare they were raw to medium raw with a cool purple center. I would have been embarrassed to put the asparagus on the plate like they did. The mashed potatoes were good. They had little bumpy things in it that made me think they were homemade. Looking back I should have taken a closer look at those bumpy things. The beer was good, glad I picked the one with the higher alcohol content. The service was slow and we had to ask for refills. If you go to there motto page it says ""it's because of you we're continually striving to make sure every moment you choose to spend with us counts. But above all we know people come here to make their good times better."" If only management would read their own site. The part that really amused me most was were they say ""We want BJ's to be a place where the moment you leave is the moment you plan on coming back.""

If it had been busy with customers or staff, a delivery, or anything other then the girls watching television for 15 minutes, this would not been  mentioned.... Once seated our waiter was lovely, however.. when the food arrived it was all wrong, no appetizer, no salad for me and our burgers came 5 minutes after.shortly followed by the bill...so boo, no enjoyment time.. Mom's minus- her fries she ordered, and accompanied by a crazy amount of spicy coleslaw she didn't order..So, just to clarify.. yes, the coleslaw comes with it, it was substituted. To give credit where it's due, the food we recieved and wanted was very good as usual. It's just sad and unfair to the kitchen staff that things are so disorganized on the front.

The first time was early feb and we ordered pizza, wings, and root beer floats and everything was amazing, even the service was spot on. We even ranked it in our top places giving it 5 stars.  We went back the other night, not even a month later and things were just wrong. Our server was friendly at first but with every request we made she grew more and more resentful bordering on rude.  I ordered the root beer float again. Last time I had 3 floats, once price. This time the waitress wouldnt refill my float and when I asked why she said that I would be charged for the ice cream. No idea, so I said no but now fuming that she refused me something that I know I was able to have, having had it not 2 weeks prior. My husband ordered the brussel sprouts with his burger and I got friend chicken. We ordered the wings again too. The wings came out fast but the sauce was off, way too much tobacco to be edible. 2 mins later they bring out the brussel sprouts... we're confused why they're out early but ignore it. 3 mins later our meals are out... now we're pissed. Our waitress comes over like ''oh good everything here'' and we remind her that we ordered it to come out separate, that our dinner will be cold by the time we get to eat to eat it.'' her reply ''oh that's too bad, enjoy!'' Manners really were her thing, we'll leave it at that. The brussel sprouts were burnt.. like char broiled and bad so we sent them back. My friend chicken was wonderful and my husband enjoyed his burger. It was the one that had pulled pork on top, he inhaled it.  I really hope someone contacts me so I can go over this with them.

Shannon H.,"North De Land, FL",203,161,481,3.0,4/18/2013,"My coworker and I stopped here for lunch today and this was our review The good:  We started out with Chicken wonton appetizers and Mozzarella sticks. The Chicken wontons come in tai or buffalo and you get 3 for about $3.00. We ordered the Tai ones and they were very good. I can tell that will be a dish I'll crave and go out of my way to get. The Mozzarella sticks were the best ones I've had from anywhere. They were crispy and flavorful as well as the cheese was nice and melted on the inside.  For lunch, I ordered half flatbread pizza (Black and Blue style) and my coworker ordered the Chicken Alfredo. My pizza was delicious! It had steak, Portabella mushrooms, red peppers, Mozzarella cheese and Blue cheese. It looked like it would be bland but from my first bite I was blown away by how well the blue cheese topped everything off. I'll definitely recommend it.  For dessert, we had a coupon for a free ""Pizookie"" Its basically a cookie baked in a small pizza pan and topped with ice cream as soon as it comes out. OMG talk about melt in your chair, roll your eyes back, and hold it in your mouth to savor the flavor!!! AMAZING! The Bad: I ordered a sweet tea and I received an unsweet tea, our waiter didn't come check on us, so I had to ask another waitress to get me sweet tea. She was very nice and pleasant but then my tea was pretty much Sugar water. I'm very particular about my sweet tea (Its the south in me) and its an honest mistake and a matter of preference.  We asked the waiter for boxes and he only brought us one box and I had to wait for my box for about 10 minutes because he got too busy taking everyone else's orders. My coworker liked her Chicken alfredo but said Red Lobster is way better. When I asked her what would make her lunch better she said its bland and could use some salt and other seasonings. She wasn't impressed. My pizza came with a side of salad and it didn't hardly have any dressing on it...order extra!

Went for lunch and decided to order there soup and salad lunch special. Positives: We had a group of 7, which the hostesses were able to accommodate immediately, seating us very quickly. Our waiter was very friendly and informative about the menu. The beer choices were very robust and the food was good, but not anything special. Negatives: The biggest problem I had with BJ's is the menu size. They have everything from pasta to pizza and burgers to seafood. The menu can seem very overwhelming with nothing that stands out. The server took a while to get to us and take our order. Once the food was brought out to us, we were looking around to figure out how we could start eating. We were never given any utensils until after we asked. Verdict: BJ's seems to fall victim of an identity crisis. A place that is ok in everything and great at nothing.

My sister, cousin and I came here for lunch and were told to stand by the wall and we would be seated next.  Next thing we know, two parties who came in after us were being seated first because they forgot about us.  So as soon as we said something the manager made sure we were seated immediately. Once at out table, we were greeted by our waitress, Jessica.  She was very quick with us and didn't give off the best impression.  Once our orders were in, we sat and waited.  We finished our sodas at one point and were not refilled for about 10 minutes, and when she would bring us refills, the cups were not completely filled.  My cousin's beer did not come to the table until 20 minutes later.  My sister's food came out first and she was halfway through eating by the time my cousin and I got our food.  When I received my food, the chicken fettucini alfredo, it was cold.  I asked the waitress for hot alfredo sauce so I could poor it on to warm up my food and she pawned it off to another waitress and had an attitude.  The alfredo sauce never showed up after waiting 15 minutes for it and everyone at my table had finished their meals.  Jessica was very inattentive, rude, pawned everything off to other waiters, didn't apologize for anything and was an overall terrible serve.  She also kept my change assuming it was her tip....which is was not. We spoke to the manager and he was great.  He took my food and my cousin's beer off the bill and gave us all mystery gift cards to use the next time we come in that could be worth anywhere between $5 and $500.

Very easy to get to from 95, plenty of parking, and there's plenty of seating available, so even if it's busy, it won't take long to get a table. We grabbed a seat at the bar to check out their beer taps and grab some grub. Bartender was great, and service was awesome. I'm always impressed by the selection of draft beers at BJ's, and their house drafts are pretty tasty, although I usually grab a Sam Adams. The menu is pretty impressive, offering a lot of different appetizers and main courses, including a few items you wouldn't expect to see at a place like this. We just ordered a couple of appetizers, and the food came out fairly quickly, it was fresh, and most importantly, very tasty. Every time I've visited a BJ's I've had a very good experience, the service is usually great, and the food has always been good. I especially enjoy the quality of the drinks and the draft beer selection. You expect this to be some kind of sports bar but it's far from it.

There sandwiches are pretty tasty but again nothing amazing. They have some pretty good salads i will say. My favorite thing about all BJs across the country are there beer and appetizers. The both of them are pretty good. I have been to lots of BJs across the country and this place is just like the rest....chain food dinning......so its pretty much always the same.  The service was nothing amazing or special either and thats why i have to give this place a just ok 3 star,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-daytona-beach-2?start=80
Beth N.,"Blacksburg, VA",0,4,,4.0,7/1/2014,"Good food, decent beer, decent service. My husband, 10 month old daughter, and I stopped here for dinner on a Monday night. We were seated within a few minutes, though I could tell the hostess and waitress were not excited about an infant in the party. The atmosphere was typical for a sports bar - but not too loud that you couldn't converse, music was fine, lots of tvs to watch, a bit chilly for shorts and a short sleeve shirt.  My husband was very disappointed by their beer menu. They list many specialty beers and seasonals, none of which were available when we stopped. They didn't have the first two beers he tried to order, even though they were on the menu. He ended up with a beer sampler of their year round brews. The IPA was pretty good; rest were mediocre, but he has pretty high standards. We ordered the appetizer sampler and a small deep dish pizza, and it was more than the three of us could eat. The avocado rolls were our favorites. The spinach and artichoke dip and mozzarella sticks were pretty classic. The other rolls on the platter tasted like spicy Taquitos (not in a bad way). We also had the Chicken Bacon Ranch pizza, which was very good. We would definitely get it again. The server warmed up to us after she realized our child wasn't a screamer/food thrower. Other servers stopped to say hi to her, too. I would say this place is not ""family friendly,"" but certainly ""family tolerant."" Overall, we thought it was a little overpriced, but the food was very good quality. We would stop here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-daytona-beach-2?start=80

Jackie S.,"Daytona Beach, FL",28,325,329,1.0,3/16/2012,"The atmosphere of BJ's is incredible, it is very spacious inside, and has a trendy metro-feel to it.  When I asked our server about what she would recommend from the menu and her only suggestion was a mixed greens salad.  I had the Baby Back Pork Ribs entree, with the mixed vegetable and a baked potato. My fiance had the New York strip steak, which arrived overcooked, with a Caesar salad and a baked potato.  My entree arrived ahead of my fiance's and it was cold, the baked potato was undercooked (it was still hard in the center), and the mixed vegetable was mostly broccoli (which is okay, but not what the server said it would be). When my fiance's steak arrived, you could tell immediately that it had been overcooked, he had requested it to be cooked medium-rare, it arrived past the point of well-done. Our server really didn't seem to care that much since she stated, ""I told you to get the salad."" Seriously? You've got to be kidding me.

She spent most of her time hanging over the table next to us. The manager hovered at the other table as well speaking with those customers. When I presented a coupon that I found on their website, I was told that I had to sign up for their rewards program to redeem it, even though it doesn't state so on the coupon or website. We told the server that we didn't wish to speak with a manager we would just sign up and move on with our night, but she sent the manager over who just made matters worse. She wasn't interested in hearing what the website/coupon said. So I just told her that we filled out the rewards information and we needed to leave. Not worth coming back to this location.

Brooke L.,"Denver, CO",8,34,2,1.0,4/10/2016,I am extremely disappointed in the level of service we received when visiting Daytona. We called a week in advance to make a large reservation for a big party. Our reservation was given out to another party so we were stuck outside on the patio. We were given 3 or 4 servers that we barely saw and took an unnecessary amount of time to get drinks. It took us 45 minutes to get our food and we had to go in and recruit another server to get us refills because we never saw our servers after food orders were taken. There was no communication for the untimely manner that food arrived at the table. When we asked to see a manager we were told we couldn't because he was cooking. Well if they were short staffed that should have been said early on... we would then understand the food arriving 45 minutes after ordering.  I'm very upset because this was a big dinner and supposed to be be a happy and pleasant experience for me and my kids.

Dustin brought our salads very quickly, both with ranch dressing.  The plates were loaded up with the greens, tomato, cucumber, croutons and the ranch dressing.  Oh my, their ranch dressing is delicious!  We both ate every bite of our salads and sipped on our ice cold Chardonnay.  The restaurant was hopping and their waiting area was filled the entire time we were there, but folks seemed fine with waiting and were seated reasonably quick.   Mike and I both commented that it felt really good that there was no rush with getting us in and out of there, just a nice leisurely meal in a place with great atmosphere.  Their bar area has a huge TV in it's center which was playing four different channels, showing various sports events. Our food arrived fairly quickly and it looked delicious.  Steaming baked potato with luscious looking veggies and a lovely ribeye steak.  As we cut into our steaks, we both noticed that they were very rare, barely even warm center on my medium rare, and Mike's medium was almost more rare than mine.  We let Dustin know, and he immediately scooped up our plates and told us he would get the steaks cooked up a bit more and get them back to us as quickly as possible.  Within a few minutes, the manager came up to our table and apologized for the steaks and let us know they were getting them taken care of in the kitchen.  So polite and apologetic, we were very impressed!  Within about 5 minutes, our plates were returned to us with steaming hot steaks, a new baked potato and steaming veggies.  Both of our steaks were perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious!  I don't know what kind of rub or marinade they use, but the taste was as good if not better than Ruth's Chris and Flemings.  Every bite melted in my mouth!  The potato was huge and the butter and sour cream, along with fresh chives was a great accompaniment to the steak.  On top of that, my winter mix of cauliflower, broccoli, fresh carrots and butternut squash was to die for!   As we were sipping our wine, and enjoying our delicious meal, the chef comes to our table and apologizes for the initially undercooked steaks.  We told him that we understood and the steaks they sent back out to our table were delicious and we were extremely happy.  He apologized once again and quietly disappeared as we continued to savor our meal. Dustin then came back to the table and asked if we were ready for dessert.   We had pretty much decided right before then that we were going to skip dessert since we were so full, and already taking home half our steaks and sides to have for lunch tomorrow.  Dustin was like, ""no way, you gotta try this dessert!  You won't regret it! ""  We acquiesced and boy, did we make the right decision!  This stuff was manna from heaven, let me tell you!  A deliciously warm brownie with a soft center (similar to ""dump cake"" or molten lava cake), with peppermint ice cream that melted perfectly along with the bites of not-too-sweet dark chocolate brownie, and the crushed peppermint candies gave the dessert a lovely crunch and so much flavor!  I don't typically eat dessert, and neither does my husband, but we ate EVERY single bite of this dessert. We joked with Dustin that ""we didn't like it at all!"" and he hung out with us for a few minutes and joked about his recent honeymoon in Key West and food and restaurant experiences -- he was just a great guy!  You must ask for him when you go to BJ's!  He was a hoot! Needless to say I am sitting in my sweat pants and baggy shirt and savoring my delicious meal and wonderful experience at BJ's ... Mike said that we should go back soon and I said ""tomorrow?  After all, it will be Funday Sunday""!   . Go soon!  You won't regret it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-daytona-beach-2?start=120

Craig E.,"Jacksonville, FL",47,58,5,2.0,9/11/2011,"Stopped at this chain restaurant on a trip, and it was conveniently off I-95.  Very impressive looking place, but underwhelming regarding food and service.  Prices are on the high side for what you receive.  Servers kept reciting scripted dialogue that included ""what would you like this evening"" or ""have a great evening' - even though it was 11:45 am.  With very few people in the place, our simple order took at least 20 minutes to arrive.  Aside from that, we ordered a turkey burger and a special italian chopped salad that sounded great on the menu with cheeses and italian meats.  The turkey burger was fine, but the salad was mostly lettuce with a nice vinaigrette dressing and a few bits of mozzarella, salami,olives,etc. - very small bits to say the least.  No bread sticks, or bread, or in fact - anything on the side - or to munch on before the order arrived.  There were a couple of good chunks of fontina - there should have been much more stuff for a salad priced between $10 -11.  The turkey burger was over $10 also.  Basically, the food was ok.  Nothing particularly special, and over-priced for some very basic items. For a $30 lunch including soft drinks and tip, we could have done better at Fridays..........",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-daytona-beach-2?start=160
Jill T.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,14,,3.0,11/12/2011,They were off tonight; in & out after agonizing 2.5 hours. Long 30 minute pauses between courses with no anticipation of needs meaning servers came and left without removing obvious dirty plates; never spontaneous water replenishing; salmon very small in portion as well as the ahi tuna and no to the pizza as too much crust and scant toppings. of course the beers- no complaint there. Conclusion is food is so so yet service extremely lax.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-daytona-beach-2?start=160
ron e.,"Wall, NJ",0,18,,3.0,4/9/2011,"We arrived at 5PM on a Wednesday- before the dinner crowd.  We were a party of three and were shown to a table- when we asked for a booth-(there were many available) the hostess gave us a very unhappy look. Our waiter was friendly and tried to be our good buddy. He took our order and brought back our drinks- we waited and waited for our salads. Finally our waiter realized that he forgot the salads and went to get them. He came back and said the salads were delayed because they were baking fresh croutons(  sure or did they open a new bag). Within minutes of getting the salads our entrees arrived- we wound up eating both salads and entrees at the same time. I had just finished my entree (still had a fork in my hand) and my wife was still enjoying her meal when our waiter arrived to clear the table and ask if we wanted anything else. When we indicated that we were not interested in dessert he whipped out the check and placed it on our table and said no rush on the check. (my wife still had half of her entree left to eat) During our meal he returned numerous times to ask how we liked our ""brewskies) He kept pushing the drinks- since I am old enough to be his father I really didnt like being treated as a college buddy. It could be he was rushing us out to have another group seated or he was just not schooled in taking good care of a customer. The food was just ok- nothing to write home about. I think that a good restaurant experience depends on a good waiter and we really felt rushed by this young waiter. I am now not inclined to go back with that experience fresh on my mind.I hope the manager sees this review and instructs his staff that return business is  more important not just the fast tip for that one evening.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-daytona-beach-2?start=160
Sixnine M.,"Daytona Beach, FL",0,17,,3.0,9/22/2010,"new place so some slip ups-speaking of which watch out for the flooors are VERY slippery,saw one lady fall-otherwise was good food and service is so so for now",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-daytona-beach-2?start=160
tess w.,"Lawtey, FL",0,10,,2.0,8/7/2010,"I went there for lunch yesterday. It seems the locals are still checking out the ""new place"" because the wait was horrible, about 40 minutes when they said it would only be 10 minutes. Yes, we should've left after the first 20 minutes went by, but we were also checking out the new place.  The waitress was too distracted, the food came out and looked as if it had been dropped and just thrown back on the plate. We ordered ""lunch size"" portions that were smaller than I'm used to and bland. I had the Cobb salad and my friend had the fish tacos, the salad had 99% lettuce with a minuscule amount of ""other"" ingredients, the tacos were better, but they should have added more chips or something on the side of the two very small tacos. The only good thing was that the beer, it's $3 at lunch time and it was very good. So we decided if we ever go back, it will be just for the beer and eat somewhere else. Maybe after the newness wears off in a few months it will improve, but it won't be on my rush back to list. For a chain Restaurant I would rate it average; the food and beers at Ruby Tuesday's down the street are better without the wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-daytona-beach-2?start=160
