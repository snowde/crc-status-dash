Laura R.,"Highland Village, TX",0,10,12,4.0,10/16/2017,"The food and service is great here! The problem is.. their website is lacking. We live not 3 blocks from here and when we go to the website you can't order delivery (which is an option). When we choose our address it states..""No delivery within 100 miles"". Really??  Recommendation to corporate... This location has awesome service and food! If your website gives the option for delivery (which it does) then you had better offer it or take it off your website.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-denton
Alisha S.,"Rowlett, TX",142,94,127,4.0,10/22/2017,"Celebrated a friend's birthday here. I ate dinner before I came, so I decided to get a cookies n cream pizookie (I'm always down for dessert). It was soooo good! I love the concept of pizookies and this one did not disappoint! It ended up being half off too, so I only paid $3!

Bill Ruff T.,"Quinlan, TX",22,171,79,5.0,8/7/2017,"Had lunch here after looking at a travel trailer. The bar was a great place to sit.

Geoffrey G.,"Denton, TX",110,258,350,3.0,6/9/2017,"BJ's is a great place to go watch a game and have a drink!  Other times it's a really loud, average bar/restaurant.  They have a great selection of beer on tap.  They make a lot of their own beers that are pretty good.  It is a little pricy compared to all the local craft bars in the area. Food is pretty decent.  They seem to be making an effort to get some more healthy options on their menu.  We tried the roasted cauliflower and the beets.  Both were good, but prices are a little high.   If you are going for a nice dinner or date, than this is not the best place for you.  This is a loud and busy place that's much better suited for watching a game or going out with friends.  They have a ton of tvs all around the restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-denton

Raheem F.,"Garland, TX",5,28,33,4.0,11/28/2017,"Came here for my best friend's birthday a couple of weeks ago and our experience was good but not the best. The waiter wasn't very friendly and didn't seem to be having the best day and it was very apparent by the service we received. Food wise, I split the jalapeño crispy burger with a friend and it was quite disappointing. The whole burger tasted unsalted. The meat was bland, the fried jalapeños were tasteless and the burger was just flavorless. The fries were pretty dry as well. I also shared the chocolate chip pizookie with a friend which was the highlight of our visit here. It truly is what Bj's does best. I think I'm just going to stick to ordering desserts here. Overall, my best friend still had a good time with us and she didn't let a bit of bad service ruin her night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-denton

Greg B.,"Denton, TX",18,33,54,4.0,1/26/2017,"This place has surprisingly become one of our new favorites in Denton. That also has a lot to do with the great location right next to the Cinemark and the times that they're open. They stay open until 12am most nights. The service is usually pretty good, although there's been a couple instances where we've waited longer than usual just to be greeted by the host and given a table. I'm talking several minutes of looking at open tables and for assistance with no acknowledgement of our existence.  I'll say though, they've definitely made up for it with the delicious food and drinks we've had here. We typically get our food pretty fast after ordering, and the waiters that have serviced us have all been outstanding and friendly. This restaurant has an enormous menu, so much so that you might be overwhelmed by the vast amount of entrees and drinks offered.  They surprisingly have really tasty boneless wings with several sauces to choose from. On this particular night I had the Spicy BBQ sauce, which I've had here before on my wings and they're very good! Super crunchy, hot, and full of juicy chicken with the perfect amount of sauce slathered on them. Their root beer glaze flavor is also delicious. Ariel went with the Mediterranean tacos, which she loved! She also loves their sandwiches. They also have delicious pizzas and desserts. Particularly the pizookies and monkey bread! Even though we've been several times, there's still so much on the menu to try, which we both look forward to very soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-denton

Tiffany K.,"Shady Shores, TX",85,25,8,1.0,2/26/2017,"I was here for lunch today with friends, it was a busy, understandably so, it's a Sunday. I orders the lemon thyme chicken. A lunch size portion of herb-roasted chicken breast seasoned with Big Poppa Smokers' Desert Gold Rub. Served with brown rice, sautéed red onions, fire-roasted red bell peppers, tomatoes and roasted brussels sprouts in lemon thyme sauce. Sounded good & looked good too. I was brought a bowl with brown liquid with two pieces of chicken, not oven roasted, look like it was boiled. No bright colored oven roasted peppers or Brussels sprouts. It was a brownish collard sauce with mushrooms and and over cook brussels sprouts, couldn't find one pop of color in the whole plate, look disgusting. I took a bite just to see it could taste good ? No I politely called the waiter over and told him that there was no way I was going to eat... Go ahead and just bring me a turkey burger, he apologized and said yeah doesn't look right. The turkey burger shows up looks great cut it in half? Something doesn't look right it's raw. It's raw???  i'm so glad I did not take a bite of it. I was shocked that any cook whatever do that, my 14-year-old nephew knows how to cook a turkey patty and he knows that you can't lay it on the grill for one second. In my heart I honestly feel that it was done to me on purpose because I sent the first plate back. I wished I would've taken a picture of the first plate of food, it was disgusting looking. Very rarely do I send my feedback or complain but when I am paying $13 for a lunch that looks nothing like what I ordered I'm not going to just eat the cost and throw in the trash. I'm now feeling so upset that anyone would do that! The manager came over and apologized saw the raw turkey burger &  acknowledged that it was raw. She asked if I wanted anything else ?   No thank you.  she took it off my bill and we left. I love BJ's in Louisville.

Lily H.,"Denton, TX",0,1,,1.0,10/13/2017,"I just went here yesterday, with a group of 9 friends. Terrible service from our waiter, Collin, I believe. Three of my friends were wrongfully charged 3$ each for food they did not order. Told the waiter and he acted upset at us. He did not change any of the checks, and took too long to even pick the checks up.  Also took very long on refills on drinks.

I called again and tracked down the manager this time insisting to speak with him.  He said he was busy with big groups and hadn't had the time to call me back.  He insisted that his food didn't make me sick.  I was extremely disappointed how the manager handled the issue and I will never go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-denton

J R.,"Dallas, TX",0,11,,2.0,6/28/2017,"$12, 13 or even $16 for a salad?  Really? So, I ordered the Top Sirloin, though mine came out more like a mushy, run over by a fork lift sirloin.  On top of that, I had not even finished my salad when the entree was presented. That is DEAD WRONG!  No excuse for this as the place was only about 15% full, though not surprising when one looks at the menu prices.  Note that the sandwiches on the ""Hoagie Rolls"" are mostly bread in their pictures.   Our first time back in more than a year and all we noted were inflated prices.

Tonight we ordered a burger medium and it came back very rare and the bacon was undercooked as well. Good customer service would dictate comping the corrected meal, but it was not. Also we specifically came in for happy hour, but were over charged. When we questioned the price, it was not corrected. The policy should be honored by all staff. Poor customer service.

Puro S.,"Dallas, TX",3,105,165,1.0,7/31/2016,"Food: 2/10 (+2 for stuffed mushrooms) Service: 3/10 Value: 5/10 Ambience: 6/10 TL;DR - Huge mistake coming here. Hope you all have a better luck. Came here with my family. The place was not overly packed, but it took the server 10 minutes to take drink orders and 5 min to bring them. We confirmed we wanted the appetizer out before the main dish when asked, but lo and behold -- everything came out at the same time 20 minutes later. My sirlion was tiny and was definitely almost well done instead of medium rare. I didn't want to wait another 20 minute for another puny piece of meat, so I ate it with disgust. It came with 5 pieces of asparagus and tasteless mashed potato all for ~$16 I believe. Glad I didn't order the $22 ribeye. The salmon dish looked nothing like the picture. It was barely half the size. The shrimp pasta dish was not good I'm guessing because only the shrimps were eaten, and we didn't take the rest of pasta home (mostly untouched). The price is definitely on the high side for what you get including the poor service. I would recommend sticking with appetizer and maybe burgers for this place.

The beer is worth a try but it's expensive and the food is on par with all the other chains, but there is a huge selection of everything.

However I will say the calamari was absolutely fantastic and that's what kept my rating from being lower than 3 stars. There were 8 of us and the server did a very good job keeping our drinks refilled and being attentive to our needs separating our checks and getting our payment done quickly.

Jimmy J.,"Denton, TX",3,18,1,3.0,1/29/2015,"Food (2 stars): I was unimpressed. I haven't been to many BJ's to know if this place is serving the standard quality. The menu is quite large with a plethora of options. On this trip I was with the whole family and was able to sample a variety of the menu. First, they have a great beer selection. Tons on tap and more in bottles. Their house beers are around $5.50 a pint and roughly a $1 cheaper than any other draft. I tried the Brewhouse Blonde and Harvest Hefeweizen. Both were very good. For an appetizer we ordered the Carnitas Fries with Chile Verde. The whole table agreed the Chile Verde did not taste that great and really ruined the fries. Also the cheese seemed to be the first thing added to the bowl because it was all melted at the bottom and not on the fries. I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger; it was just ok. Red Robin and Chili's make better burgers and for the $10 price tag I expected more. The bacon and cheese were cut thin; I could see through the cheese to the burger. The lettuce was completely wilted. If they put mayonnaise and their ""signature burger sauce"" I could not tell as both buns were dry. My wife ordered the Chicken Fried Steak. The meat was very tender and tasty. The breading stayed together and did not fall off but had little flavor. The country gravy had a good consistency and flavor but they didn't serve enough on the steaks to have with every bite. The mash potatoes were dry which made the fact that they were served without gravy even more obvious. The boys had the Kid's burger and chicken strips. The boys all agreed that they were good. The lettuce for their burgers was served on the side, so it was nice and crisp; wish they would have done that for mine. Facilities (5 stars): Being new, this place is very clean. Walking in the dining room is laid out well with the bar area on the right and tables on the left. The bar itself is an artistic focal point with lighted shelves illuminating the well organized bottles of liquor. There are several TV's located through out the bar and restaurant; not to many to be in your face but just enough so you can watch from any seat. Booths are comfortable albeit a little tight. The bathroom is clean, but laid out rather odd and 1 of the 3 automatic faucets did not work. The parking setup is the only issue and it's minor. There is minimal parking in the front, so we had to park in the back and walk around. Service (4 stars): We had good, but not great, service. The restaurant was probably at 60% capacity. We wanted to sit in a booth and one was available but had to be bussed. It took about 5 minutes to have the table cleaned; not a long time at all but considering I didn't see them cleaning any other tables before ours made me question why it took so long. Our server was attentive and kept the boys' sodas refilled quickly (one of my major markers on quality of service, my glass better not be empty). Orders were brought promptly and issues (missing ranch) were resolved with speed. Value (2 stars): For a mid-week dinner out with the entire family, a couple beers, and an appetizer our bill after tip was around $70. This is on the high end of what we look to expend and for the quality of food not a good value. It would have been nice to have some happy hour specials. Overall (3 stars): I like the layout and look of this BJ's. The beer was nice and cold! I'll be back to sit in the bar and have a few drinks, but the family agreed we probably will not be back for a dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-denton?start=80

However, last week I ordered their Kale and Roasted Brussel Sprouts salad and discovered halfway through the salad that it didn't have any kale at all nor did it have any romaine and very few Brussel sprouts. Instead the salad was full of Arugula and I guess they thought I wouldn't know the difference. I mentioned it to the waitress and she did nothing about it. Normally I would have asked for the manager, but we were a party of six and I didn't want to embarrass our friends. The next day I wrote them an e-mail using the website and so far I have not had the courtesy of a reply or acknowledgement that they received it.

I signed on to Yelp just because of this restaurant. the steak was horrible the baked potato was horrible and how can you mess that up I have no idea my wife got very sick because of the steak and potato. the steak tasted like it had been cooked on a 2x4 plank but yet it had burnt marks from a grill surface and completely burnt all the way across the bottom and had no juice whatsoever  completely dry . we think the potato must have been left out for hours because it was almost pink on the inside. I had a pumpkin pizookie that was pretty good but I bought a large chocolate chunk pizookie for my daughter and took it home and the cookie portion was cooked to a crisp. this is the second time we've been there and the second time we ask for a gluten free menu which is so small and printed out on regular paper you can't even see it not even the waitress could see this or read it. We pointed out the condition of the steak to the manager and he said quietly alright I'll let the Cook know never offered to fix the situation or replace the steak and we were still charged. I will never be going back nor anyone in my family and I would recommend that you not either.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-denton?start=80

We ordered drinks and some water for the table.  My water arrived with something green floating in it.   Our server wasn't anywhere to be found so had to wait until she returned to take our order.  We placed our order - Cherry Chipotle Salmon and French dip steak sandwich.  We saw our server only when food was being served.   When the food arrived it look good.  The Salmon was very good but didn't have a lot of the chipotle sauce as they advertised.  All the couscous was lemon tasting as someone added a lot of lemon to the dish.  Overall it was good.  As for the French Dip, it looked appealing but aft r a fe bites we realized the sandwich was actually cold.  We couldn't find our waitress so my date continued to eat his sandwich being hungry.   After almost completing his dish, our server appeared.  We asked if the sandwich was supposed to be hot.  She said yes and got the manager.  We told him the same thing.   He said he would notify the kitchen and offered to make another sandwich.   Considering my date ate most of his we declined.  It was nice to see they remove his entree from the bill when we checked out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-denton?start=80

My wife is allergic to wheat and dairy, and BJ's has an allergen menu.  It's kind of limited and difficult, but the waitress understood well and had recommended modifications to normal items. Timing is average - not rushed, but not slow.  Waitstaff never left us hanging, and drinks were refilled before empty.  At delivery, the runner asked if it looked right.  Half way through, the waitress verified it tasted good.  At the end, the manager verified the whole experience was okay.

I am in Denton often for work and usually struggle to find something different for mealtime. This location being new, I thought I'd give BJ's another try. Bad idea. Waiter was a fuzzy, less than enthusiastic guy who had the tone of ""I hate being here"" in his voice. When he finally plopped our drinks on the table he said ""I'll be back in a minute"" and walked off. He returned about five minutes later to ask if we had decided.... Um... While waiting for the food to arrive I noticed ALL wait staff was moving in half speed. I had plenty of time to notice that this place had the same cold pretentious atmosphere that I hated about the first BJ's I had been to. After several minutes the waiter returned to say he didn't know what was taking so long and the manager would offer us a salad or soup. I replied that I just wanted our order. Another several minutes later the waiter passed by and said the food was almost done. When I initially sat down, I checked and answered an email. That was at 12:08. At 12:45, still without lunch, we got up and left.

I have yet to find a dish on the menu that isn't remarkably bland. Sadly, the food is not half as bland as the service. I'm fairly certain that one of the requirements to serve at this restaurant is to have as little personality as possible. Even a rude server would be an appetizing breath of fresh air in this drab Bermuda triangle of sad service staff. The pizza is probably the best menu item even though it's about 80% crust, 20% toppings. This location doesn't offer the thin crust pizza option that the nearby Lewisville location offers so prepare to chew some bread. They do offer an extremely thin ""Tavern Cut"" pizza on which the ratios are a little bit better. I'd say this one's about 35% topping, 10% crust, and 55% I'm still hungry.

Mark B.,"Denton, TX",0,3,,3.0,12/10/2014,"Our 1st time to this new location in denton our waiter was very good the food not so much, we both had chicken fried steak which was greasy, had too much black pepper and not enough gravy, mixed veg was uncooked. We will go back after they've been open for a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-denton?start=60
Alisa S.,"Denton, TX",46,31,31,3.0,2/14/2015,"Although I usually enjoy this place, I have to say that they are very proud of their wines, and we are not talking about ""fine"" wine either. A glass of Barefoot is $6, same price you can find this entire bottle at your local grocer. I do not recommend BJs as an idea for ""just a drink"". I give it 3 stars because their wine prices are insane.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-denton?start=60
