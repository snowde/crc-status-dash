Sal V.,"Pico Rivera, CA",78,6,,5.0,3/13/2017,I took my family out tonight and had a great experience because of our severe Joe R. He was very cool and pleasant to us and really took care of us during our dinner. Our pizza came out quick and hot and great. He made sure we had our refills. Hopefully we get him next time we go. I usually don't write about servers at all but when you get a great server like him you make an exception.. thanks Joe!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-downey?start=100

Lisa T.,"Azusa, CA",71,8,3,3.0,10/14/2016,"This used to be one of my favorite BJ's to visit. However, I was less than thrilled when our server, Juan, failed to refill our water we waited our entire visit for, failed to clear our table of used dishes to make room for our dessert, and made us wait an absurd amount of time for our boxes to take our leftovers home.  I tried to take into consideration it was dinner time and busy, but every single table in our area had their used dishes taken away before ordering any dessert. I'm only giving 3 stars instead of 1 because Juan wasn't rude and the food was good. I won't be returning to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-downey?start=100

Jennifer S.,"Portland, OR",666,562,1974,1.0,8/13/2014,"(UPDATED on August 17). Ugh. They disappoint me. Then, they make me believe that they're okay again... only to disappoint me again. Fool me twice, shame on me. Today, my boyfriend and I ordered salads for take out around 9:00pm. In the one time in the past, they put the dressing in a container inside the salad container. We, unfortunately, didn't think we needed to check our meals before we left. (We were sooo hungry!)  Guess what? They didn't give us any dressing. NONE. Zilch. I would've rather had a salad pre-mixed with dressing than a salad with no dressing at all. $30 for salads... salads with no dressing. I know. $30! Ugh.  That's it. I can't even look at this place. It's taken me on an emotional roller coaster. I'm sorry, Downey BJs, but our relationship has ended. - - - UPDATE:  So, I was invited back by the manager after above fiasco. Unfortunately, they didn't do any better. It took almost an hour after we ordered to get our food. I was informed the take out person is new... but an hour? And they almost forgot to give us a sandwich. They tried to be really nice about it - offering beverages, etc. Still. By the time we got home, our take out was cold. Ugh. I'm sorry.

Great server and attentive. She helped me pick out my meal. Which in hindsight is my fault. I am so picky but I will say the Parmesan Chicken tasted well. However, one piece was nicely browned while the other was barely golden. I actually wasn't sure if it was the chicken. Long story short I got sick from it. Kind of knowing the chicken wasn't done.  Other than that, my margarita was the bomb. Wish the fruit wasn't frozen so I could actually eat it with my teeth chattering.  My date enjoyed his food as well. He is simple to please.

Stephanie A.,"Los Angeles, CA",158,114,331,1.0,10/17/2014,VERY disappointed with the deep dish. It is a lie. Don't order it please. I see the manager walking around but he clearly avoided us. I tried to get his attention it was a no go. So the only good thing here is the beer not even the pasta. The calamari is subpar. The beer is great! On the plus side our server Danny was amazing!!

Rayshawn W.,"Paramount, CA",823,560,2240,4.0,11/9/2017,"It's that time of year again where Pumpkin Spice reigns supreme and BJ's has jumped on the bandwagon.  This is my preferred location and still remains to be so. I've never had bad service here. I stopped in to catch a Dodgers game and to grab a couple of appetizers. Fried calamari and stuffed mushrooms are my go to but instead of calamari I went ahead and tried two flavors of wings I haven't prior. The Nashville Hot and Exxxxtra Hot Buffalo are decent but the original hot & spicy buffalo still remains my favorite of the sauces.  On to the Pumpkin Spice aka Spiced Pumpkin. BJ's has conjured up one crazy mix of a drink with Rumchata, Mount Gay Black Barrel Rum, BJ's Pumpkin Ale, and pumpkin puree. A bold mix like that deserved a try from myself. The result is a taste that's as crazy as it sounds lol. I couldn't pin point an individual flavor in taste except for the pumpkin. All others served to give an odd but somewhat strong flavor. Enough of it would probably knock you on your back haha.  The Dodgers took a loss that night but hey, the food and service was good as always. Just another chill night at the BJ's Downey location.

Jessica L.,"San Diego County, CA",187,11,17,1.0,12/19/2017,"I've been a loyal customer to BJs since they opened in Downey and I've really never left unsatisfied or felt like I had bad service. Today, I went to order take out and wanted to use my rewards points for $25 off. When I requested this, the cashier named GLORIA M asked me if she can see an email or proof showing that I had the points to be eligible for the discount. (I wasn't mad yet) But, BJs has the entire thing on their computer system and I never had been asked to look for an email or code online. They literally print out the total points FOR YOU. She insisted that I needed a code and made me look for my email and online account to show her proof I had the eligibility. During the entire thing, she kept giving me attitude and was being rude giving me looks and all. This was frustrating because after several minutes of trying and failing to find proof I had enough points, she just went to the manager and asked for help. The manager showed her how to redeem on the screen and EASY and DONE. What should've taken a minute to order took 10 minutes. Even till the end, she was like ""next time, you still need to show us the code to redeem your points""...there is NO code. It's not even over here... Once I got my food, I wasn't even surprised to see that I got chicken instead of the shrimp I ordered. When I took it to the counter, she insisted I ordered chicken. She faulted me when she got the order wrong....why did I have to be the one to blame for the wrong order? I had to wait another 15 minutes so that I could leave with my correct order.  Yes, not even funny but it's not over yet... She was also discriminating customers? While I was waiting for her second try at my order, I noticed that she offered other customers water while they wait...but she never offered or asked me neither the first or second time.  When my correct order came out, she didn't even bag my food for me. She just placed it on the counter after announcing that my order was out and I had to bag it myself. What place makes you bag your own food order, whether or not you use the same bag...?  Thank you Gloria M! Thanks to you I was able to stay at BJs for 40 minutes to delay my family dinner so that I can feed them with half cold and half warm food!  I've never ever felt so angry with customer service here or at ANY BJs ever. But this was just the worst... Really really really deserves 0 stars, but unfortunately I have to at least leave 1.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-downey
Silvia H.,"Anaheim, CA",2,12,12,2.0,11/6/2017,"I placed an order online for take out to be ready at 3:30pm. I was waiting in line to pick up my order but the cashier was on the phone for over 10 minutes and the other woman next to her simply said ""we will be right with you."" Thankfully a nice man jumped in and started to pack my order and help check my order out. I ordered a 2 flavor pizookie which was sad looking and after my 15 minute wait in their lobby and 2 minute drive back to work, my ice cream was melted.  My chicken tortilla soup should be called Tortilla Soup as there was 2 tiny pieces of chicken in it.  My ranch dipping sauce is unbelievably salty ... how do you get ranch wrong?

BJs is always a great choice when you're looking for great food, exceptional customer service, and an assortment of drinks, let's not forget they  have a nice selection of desert as well.   We were seated in 8 maybe 10 minutes tops. Our server Xochitl or however you spell it? So-she is the pronunciation I believe was perfect. She recommended a few items on the menu that we couldn't go wrong with choosing.

Ben L.,"Long Beach, CA",854,313,3464,2.0,5/30/2017,"I came with a large group and was able to try many different appetizers, including the ahi poke, root beer glazed ribs, sampler platter, calamari, stuffed mushrooms, and buffalo wings. The apps were all right, the best being the ahi poke. It came with crispy chips to contrast the soft tuna. My experience overall was disappointing. Everyone in my party received their entree, and they brought me a top sirloin instead of the ribeye I ordered. By the time my ribeye came out most of my group was done eating, while I had just begun to eat. It really put a damper on the whole vibe. Unfortunately, that wasn't the worst part; the ribeye was awful. It must have been select or canner grade. It was tough, chewy, and low quality. I didn't expect a Mastro's quality steak, but c'mon, I can make a steak at home much better than that for $24. BJ's claims to age their steaks 28 days. I can guarantee this steak was no where near that level. Fortunately I had a tomato soup before the ribeye. It was all right, very tomatoey, and not too creamy. The beignet dessert tasted stale. It's like they served us an old one that had been made hours before and sat around. I probably won't be back, but if so I definitely will never order the ribeye here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-downey

The soup was cold, the Caesar salad had no dressing, and the croutons were stale.  My pizza crust was soggy and limp.  My son's steak was the size of a small burger.  My pizookie cookie was delicious. The one other time we had issues out of the perhaps 60 times we've been to the restaurant, we let the manager know that my prime rib was gray when I had ordered it rare. The manager explained that the oven knob got hit or turned by someone and that all of the prime rib was like that.  Since I had mentioned it to my waitress I thought that something should've been done about it.

michele f.,"Long Beach, CA",55,24,12,2.0,10/25/2017,"The hostess was awesome and the food is great and a fair price.... Here is why I won't be back.  I went to lunch today as I often do and sat at the bar so as not to take up a table for two or four. After a reasonable wait, maybe 5 minutes I was acknowledged and my order was taken.  There were 5 people at the bar area in an area that seats roughly 15 people. There were three very lovely ladies sitting to my left  who where taking up a staff of three people. Great service. For them.  So I wait for my small pizza. (My $16 small pizza) 15 minutes, 20 minutes, 25 minutes. After 30 minutes I signal my bartender (who  was busy doing bartender stuff with the ladies) I had not heard from him since he set my place setting 1/2 hour prior.  I inquired as to the status  of my $16 small pizza.  Here is the thing. I realize the kitchen gets backed up.  I get it. I am in retail for God's sake. Things happen. But....to be ignored, for 1/2 hour without so much as a ""I will go check on your order"", ""it's will be just a few more minutes"", ""do you want another glass of wine"". Unacceptable..  Icing on the Pizza? I ate one quarter of the pizza and inquired about the check. Oh my credit card was charged in record time. But  I was not offered a ""to go"" container for the 3/4 of my remaining pizza. Maybe there is a minimum charge before BJ's offers you a ""to go"" container? There is a reason the word  ""Service"" is used in the Food Service Industry.  I spent a great deal of money over the years entertaining clients at BJ's at the Stonewood center.

Andrew P.,"Long Beach, CA",138,341,761,3.0,6/30/2017,"Came in last night with a friend to watch the Angels/Dodgers game in the bar area. Our original server (whose name we never got; he was a long-bearded guy with plugs in his ears) took a while to get to our table to get drinks. When he did take our drink orders, he took our food orders as well since we wanted to do some appetizers. We ordered 2 waters, an order of Buffalo wings, and a mini deep dish pepperoni pizza. Almost 15 minutes pass by, and no sign of our drinks. We couldn't really find our server anyways, and when we did see him, he would be talking to people (friends) that he clearly knew at the bar (he gave one of them a hug). Mind you, our server never asked if we wanted our wings drizzled or with the sauces in the side (every BJs I've ever been to, they've asked, except for last night). He never brought napkins or plates either for our food.  Our food came out moments later, and we had to ask the lady who brought it out about our drinks. She apologized and then Adrian (another server in the bar area) brought waters out for us.  We also bothered him for some extra ranch, napkins, peppers for the pizza, etc.  We felt bad, but we felt that our server was nonexistent and needed better service. Adrian quickly brought out our needed items and asked if we needed anything else. Eventually we saw him again, and flagged him down for a pitcher of beer. At this point, my friend and I asked Adrian if he could just take care of us instead since our other server was never around (again, could see him talking to one of his buddies). We explained to him that we would prefer him over the other dude since he wasn't taking great care of us and providing the proper service. Without a doubt, he made sure that he could take care of us, and did an amazing job.  He was always on it for the rest of our dining experience, and was super friendly. At the end of the night, he handed us our bill and told us that he took off/discounted some items from our bill due to the inconvenience and unfortunate service. He apologized and said that it definitely wasn't BJs' standards and he felt bad. Overall, Adrian was just super great and we were glad to have the pleasure of him serving us in replacement of the other guy. I don't know if it was maybe because we are two young adults who he (our first server) may have just assumed we weren't going to tip well, or maybe he wasn't a good server...... not sure, but jokes on him because we tipped Adrian over 20%.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-downey

Linda L.,"Los Angeles, CA",497,349,855,3.0,3/14/2015,1 check-in I decided to order take out one night since I wasn't in the mood to leaving the house with NY babies just to go eat. Ordered 2 entrees and a side salad. Pick up time was at 6pm but my husband ran an hour late. They were kind enough to give me a courtesy call to ask if I would still pick up my take out order. I assured them I am just that my husband was running a bit late.  So my husband picked up our take out. First thing I asked was for my salad. Apparently it wasn't packed in. Again another disappointment that my take out order wasn't given the entire order. Upset I called the store to asked if its possible to have a refund over the phone for the missing salad because I did not want to have to go back to pick it up. Manager apologize and was kind enough to give me two options. Either get a refund by phone or he can send me a gift card for the amount + a gift. I thought why not I can wait. The salad was well under $4 anyways. Sure enough. I received the gift card in the mail. The manager had written an apology for the mistake and given me a small gift to go along with the refund of the salad. Though I was pleased with the incident. I'm very pleased with the service. They did the right thing to assure the customer would be happy. The food I ordered came delicious and warm still even though my husband ran an hour late for pick up.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-downey?start=140

I spoke with the manager he said he would bring me out another steak. 20 mins later the second steak came out and it was even worse!! The steak was completely black! So over cooked that it wasnt even tender just a hard piece of steak!!! I was extremely disappointed and angry! I didnt even try to eat it!! I just asked for my bill and asked to speak to the manager again! I payed! Waited for about 10 minutes and the manager never came!

Michael P.,"Paramount, CA",47,23,21,2.0,3/18/2015,"I am writing my review based on our visit last night (St Patrick's day). So I give it two stars based on the fact that we were sat very quickly and the staff who dealt with our issue was very courteous.  Let's see, where do I start? Ok so we sat down and ordered drinks and an appetizer. Everything seemed to be going well, we put in our dinner order and I asked if my ribeye steak could be butterflied to avoid it being burnt. As soon as the food came out, there were two issues, the steak was too charred and it was a New York steak. So the server said I'll get you a ribeye and make sure it's not burned. She offered a soup while I wait. I said sure I'll take one. Let me also add, my parents ordered a burger and it said it had green leaf lettuce. This burger had the nastiest clumps of ""lettuce"" in it, when we brought it to the servers attention she said ""umm ok do you want another burger or what?"" As if there was nothing wrong with the lettuce. My parents just said ""bring us fresh lettuce and we'll eat it."" Lettuce never came. So everyone is pretty much done with their food, when the soup arrives. Didn't look at all appealing. The. She says ""oh your steak should be right out."" Steak came out and it was charred on the outside and very undercooked inside. This is an issue I have every time I order steak at BJ's, I guess I should follow my servers advice and ""find a new plate"" Thanks for reading.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-downey?start=140

Zulima T.,"Cerritos, CA",1,17,7,2.0,7/2/2017,"Came here last night with the boyfriend for date night. Now, we always go to the Bj's in Cerritos but I convinced him this time to change it up and go to Downey instead. His exact words were ""I don't like going to Downey because they always have terrible service there."" We get there and order the avocado eggrolls. Eggrolls come but with no plates. My boyfriend asks the waiter who dropped off the eggrolls (who is not our waiter) if we could please get some plates. He literally did not stop walking from the moment he saw my boyfriend talking to him. He didn't even turn to look at him. He heard my boyfriend ask for the plates and kept on walking. We looked at each other puzzled and he said ""Did that guy just ignore me right now?"" I saw him just look over and keep on walking. I was furious. Our regular waiter comes with the plates and I ask him who was the waiter that dropped off our eggrolls. He says his name is Steven. I told him what happened and that we were very upset. The manager comes over a few moments later and says he heard we had an issue. We explain what happened and he was very apologetic about it. Our food arrives and the girl who brought out our food brings us the wrong pizza. First, she looked completely lost not knowing which table to go to. I suspected that would be our food and when she gets there it's the wrong kind of pizza. Our waiter comes and apologizes saying she made a mistake and that the correct pizza was right there the whole time. We were almost done with our food and a family comes to sit at the table behind us. They ask that waiter Steven something and again this asshole just walks by without responding to them. The lady turns to her husband and says ""Did you see the way that waiter acted?"" By now we're already getting our bill and about to leave. The manager was kind enough to comp our appetizer for the inconvenience. This review gets 2 stars because our waiter whose name I did not get was great and the manager was very nice. However, that dick Steven should not be working there as he has to deal with the public and he is obviously not fit for the job.

Lisa S.,"Long Beach, CA",1311,1836,312,3.0,7/25/2015,"I used to be a fan of the pizza at BJ's, but on this last visit, I feel like there was way too much bread for the amount of toppings. There was a (very) thin layer of meat and cheese blanketing fluffy and oily dough. Don't get me wrong. I like bread, but I also like cheese and meat. After two pieces, I (along with some other friends) got extremely sleepy and wanted to take a nap. We were attending a work event in the patio area, and it was really hot. There were ceiling fans humming away lazily above and windows were open, but the whole place was pretty warm. I was unfortunate enough to sit in the sun for a bit (there wasn't much seating anywhere else by the time I arrived), and I was uncomfortably sweaty after 30 minutes. I had to move inside. There was plenty of room there and around the bar, and I wish they would have let us move inside. That would have been preferable. Actually, they weren't all that happy with members of our group flooding the bar area. They wanted us to order with the server in the patio. However 1) she had too much to take care of on her own, and though she was doing a good job, people wanted more service, and 2) it was too hot out there for many.

Jenni M.,"Downey, CA",425,684,2351,2.0,3/15/2013,"So I went here with my husband because he & a co-worker always stop by one of these if they are having a late afternoon lunch. This was my first time in this restaurant. It was the evening of February 26, 2013 at about 6:30. Place was not really packed at that time. If I liked beer, I'd probably have something to say about the selections, but I don't. I just know that my husband likes the Jeremiah Red beer.  So, a key notes... The hostess & our waitress were friendly & got the job done. Restrooms were decent. The avocados on my California chicken sandwich were green and fresh. The fries I got were the super thin, crispy ones. They were good.  Now for my seemingly harsh critique... I hoped for much more roasted green chiles (I noticed they spelled it ""chilies"" on their menu--say what??) than they put on it, but I'm not where near Hatch, New Mexico, to school them on the glory that is green chile. The chicken was cooked fine, but the sourdough bread was saturated with grease. Ultimately, I was totally turned off by the fact, though, that my first set of silverware was dirty. The leftover food on the fork surely would've been too easy to see as they were rolling them up because I saw it before having even unwrapped the napkin. Then there was something floating in my lemonade that shouldn't have been there. Maybe it was like pepper or something, but how the heck did it get there?

Jackie G.,"Irvine, CA",0,3,1,1.0,9/20/2016,"Last night I decided to have some dinner with my friends. We arrived and we're interested in the bar area. Knowing the bar area is self seating from the many times I have visited this restaurant , I see a booth becoming available, and ask for it to be cleaned to be told by the hostess in the front that the party standing next to her phoned ahead for the booth. I was very confused by what she told me because being a premier member I've attempted to call ahead for a table to be told that parties of 9 or more are accepted for reserved tables. I don't understand why she said they phoned ahead if that party arrived minutes after we did and I heard the young lady ask for the booth once we were already standing next to it.  The hostess needs to be properly retrained, I understand the concept of self seating but honestly do not believe she does.  Definitely a disappointing visit last night",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-downey?start=180

I love their avocado/chipotle eggs rolls with the sweet sauce ( little hint of spicy, but good ! ) The 3 star rating is really only for the second dish we had which was the Calamari. It was too greasy and not crunchy at all but a bit rubbery and the 2 sauces that came with it just did not compliment the Calamari. One seemed or tasted like a thick ranch style dressing but the consistency of sour cream and the second was a marinara that had no real flavor to it.

Not only did we wait about an hour and a half for a ""45 minute"" wait time, or have at least five parties of 6+ people get seated before us even though we got there before, but they also charged us DOUBLE the amount of the check we signed for. I understand that in some transactions it shows up as two charges on your bank statement and one might get voided once one goes through but no, not in our case. It was a single transaction charged for double the amount. Like the time to at least get seated wasn't bad enough.

Ryan M.,"Orange County, CA",909,913,3414,4.0,4/2/2015,"I don't often write about big chain restaurants, but when I do, only because I have to recognize them for their service. This is a special one. With my girlfriend and I having a busy day in SoCal, we decided to eat at a general restaurant. We didn't want anything fancy, but something safe. With a good track record, we dined in at BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse in Downey. Located at the north segment of the StoneWood Mall near the Food Court, you'll find BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse. I always loved the name BJ's. More particularly because of a TV series called, ""M*A*S*H*. There is plenty of parking at BJ's/StoneWood Mall. Unless its Christmas Season, then worry just a little. We walked up to the entrance of BJ's and I saw two doors. One regular swinging door, but I saw a REVOLVING door. OK, when I come to LAX or when I am ever in New York, I will always want to go in & swing around. Once we walked into BJ's, I noticed how huge it was. Tall ceilings & huge dining areas. They were even hosting a little party in the patio area.  We checked in & requested a booth seating. The staff gladly found one for us. I love that they did find a booth, but it was one of those for like six plus people. More room for us to feel comfortable. Our host for the evening was Melinda. We started off with drinks. My gf ordered Lemonade ($2.75) and I ordered a Club Soda ($2.95) with a glass of water with lemon. Not sure why Club Soda is a little more expensive than regular soda. I didn't even have a hangover since I don't drink. I should have just ordered a Sprite. When Melinda asked us if we were ready, my gf answered before she finished her question. Let's say that we were very hungry after our busy adventure through SoCal. She wanted to start with an appetizer. She ordered the Flat Bread Margherita Pizza ($9.50) with no tomatoes. We would order our main meal a few minutes later. I know my gf loves this flat bread very much. After inputting the appetizer in, Melinda gave us a few minutes to look over the main course. My gf and I were discussing what she should order. I had my eyes set on a salad. She had two options for herself. It was either the BBQ Chicken Pizza or the  Shrimp Scampi Pasta. I told her to order the Shrimp Scampi Pasta because we had the flat bread. When Melinda came back, we started our order. I had no questions about my order. I ordered the Barbecue Chicken Chopped Salad ($12.95) with a separate side of Honey Mustard dressing. My gf asked Melinda about her preference, but ultimately my gf went towards the Shrimp Scampi Pasta ($16.50). Once we placed our order, the flat bread came. Great timing for two hungry people. Just think of it as a small version of a pizza. Love the cheese & the small thin crust. Don't forget to add the Parmesan cheese. I had finished half of my Club Soda and Melinda was already on top of it by getting me another glass. About 10-15 minutes later, our food arrived. Like many other Yelpers, we took pictures of our food. My salad was delicious with the mix greens with the onion rings with the barbecue sauce. Also, I loved how every time I munched into the salad, there was one ingredient felt like I was eating an apple. I am not sure if it was the lettuce or an ingredient I am not familiar with. Dipped both the onion rings & chicken slices with the honey mustard, it made the meal more spectacular. As for my gf's dish, she tried the Shrimp Scampi Pasta and was already feeling nauseated with it. She had me sample it and the taste was very bland and dry. According to the menu, its supposed to be ""Flavorful shrimp tossed with delicate angel hair pasta in a light blend of olive oil"". The pasta felt like the oil was never there and the pasta felt like it was poorly cooked. She couldn't deal with it and flagged down Melinda. My gf told her that this dish was just not right at all. I had to agree with her. So, my gf wanted to have her dish switched with one of her two choices. It was the BBQ Chicken Pizza ($15.25). The male supervisor or the Shift Manager came by our table with a sincere apology & would get the order taken care of. The Shift Manager came back & personally delivered the Deep Dish BBQ Chicken Pizza. He apologized for the food preparation. The final test: My gf's enjoyment. I didn't get to try this out, but my gf loved it. We were back to high spirits with the dish. Although her food was not originally done right the first time, it was making sure the customer was taken care of. When it was time to check out, we saw that Shift Manager took off the order for the Shrimp Scampi & comp'd the BBQ Chicken Pizza. Now, this changes everything for my reviews. I don't write reviews for big places, but service like this requires recognition. In a perfect world, things should be done  with one shot. However, we live in a realistic world. We learn from our mistakes & we make the situation even better. Thank you BJ's! Yelp...I Live, Breathe, and Share my Reviews for everyone to read.

Brian L.,"Downey, CA",83,27,7,3.0,11/13/2016,"Here we go... As always (At least how I've seen it), good group effort to bring out appetizers and salads. The skins and mozz sticks were tasty. Our server had a pleasant demeanor and although we were disappointed without the berry cider, things happen and he was apologetic about the issue, which is quite appreciated. I usually do a refill test when I eat, my thing is that a customer's drink (at least the non alcoholic one) should never go empty and if it is...ask each time about refills or handle business if they're using the restroom. We were only asked about refills towards the end, so our server missed at least 3-4 other opportunities to inquire during our visit. Anyways, the issue rarely occurs at this location, but it is good to remind people every now and then to ensure that such an epidemic of no refills doesn't occur. Got it? Good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-downey?start=80

Matt C.,"Bellflower, CA",300,227,321,5.0,7/19/2015,"We like to visit BJ's on Tuesday because it's ""Half Price Wine Day."" Today we had Cayla as our waiter. We love the Watermelon and Feta salads so naturally we started with those. Cayla delivered our wine and poured it for us. She maintained our glasses by stopping buy with her excellent, non-intrusive service. We were in the mood for pizza again and had the flatbread pepperoni which was excellent. We ordered another bottle of wine and Cayla poured it throughout as expected. We come to BJ's fairly often and find the service hit or miss - but usually okay. Cayla is definitely a cut above the rest. She pays attention to the details.  The restaurant was very clean and the food was very good and the service was EXCELLENT.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-downey?start=80

We tried the mixed appetizer with avocado spring roll, some type of chicken roll and breaded cheese sticks.  I personally had the kale brussel sprouts salad with blackened salmon which I really liked.  A good mix of sweet and salty and not too heavy.  The salmon was delicious.  Someone else had the bison burger and it was delicious.  The steak was too fatty apparently.  I tried the unsweetened tropical tea and it's refreshing.  A few people got the strawberry lemonade which is pretty popular here.  They only have green and black and tropical tea as unsweetened.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-downey?start=80

Hannah B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",35,90,73,2.0,4/15/2017,"The bar staff are very friendly and on top of their stuff. Unfortunately after we were seated it all went downhill. There was no refills of drinks. I ordered a BBQ chicken salad that was completely dry and maybe had two stripes of BBQ sauce on it. Worse part was I had to ask three people for silverware so I didn't get to eat my salad until around 15 minutes after I got it. Our waitress was really unfriendly and made us feel like we were being a hassle even when we asked to pay. She took about 10 minutes to return our card after she took the bill and when she brought it back she handed it to my husband and said ""there you go"" and walked away. No have a good night, no thank you, nothing. The BJs in Cerritos, Orange and Huntington Beach have friendlier staff so I advise you to go there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-downey?start=80

Today I placed a to go order, well, two separate orders, actually. I spoke to Chris. He was very nice and accommodating. Lolly took my order and was also very nice over the phone. The problem lies in the fact that I called and placed the order at 1:36. Lolly said it would be between 10 & 15 minutes. I get here at 1:50. I park in the designated area and call. They place me on hold for a few minutes and Chris comes back on the line. He says Lolly will bring my order out momentarily.

You also can't go wrong with any beer you choose. Food was good as always. Before our meal we had buffalo wings and mozzarella sticks. Those never disappoint.

Ok, this place is always packed and loud but that doesn't stop me from coming. I love their Jeremiah Red beer, their Balsamic Glazed Chicken and their pizookie (Heaven!). I always try to get a seat at the bar section but the majority of the time it's pretty hard especially when you have Dodger/Laker games. Anyhow, I strongly suggest you give them a call and have them add your name to the wait list (if they have any that day) because waiting time for two can be 10-15 mins, I can only imagine how long it'll take for a big party. Pros: Good food Plenty of TV's to watch the games Good alcoholic beverages Good food Pretty good service (depending on your server, obviously) Cons: Pretty long wait time Loud Parking can be a bit hectic",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-downey?start=200

We got there fairly early and was seated quickly, our server was efficient and polite. the issue here is that we ordered said Brunch which is basic pancakes, weird bacon , and some eggs. Cool no problem, except it took over an hour to get our food. Sure it was a little busy, I've seen worse, but over an hour twiddling your thumbs at the table was not cool, and pops was not happy. After patiently waiting we found a manager and she offered to see the issue and we never saw her again. The food came out mildy warm and the whole experience was just blah. No one was happy this day, sadly. We get it, it's a Holiday, and busy busy, but really over an hour for pancakes and scrambled eggs? Not cool BJ's.  Fyi we tipped our server as usual, he was awesome.

The staff was nice by making sure I got the right size table for my meeting. The other thing was that the staff had plenty of patience with our 2hr meeting.

Rosie R.,"Compton, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/16/2016,"PLEASE IMPROVE. I have been here plenty of times but I will never return. The past 2 times were terrible. It took a long time to get drinks, our appetizers were brought Out at the same time as our entree. The server left all the empty glasses and extra plates on our table for our entire dinner. I had my 2 year old son with me so having the plates clear is important for me to enjoy my dinner. Of course my son wants to throw the plate on the floor. He is a toddler! Either way whether my son was there or not plates should be cleared. Don't bring me another glass of water with out taking the empty one! We told the server we were sharing an entree and he only brought one plate, and took a while to bring us another so my husband and I are eating from the same plate sharing the steak knife.  The cherry on top was that our steak was over cooked.  When the server asked if everything was okay, at the same time my husband and I said no. They called over the female manager that just apologized and said she was removing our appetizer for us. Like she was doing us a favor. We didn't want the appetizer anymore because we wanted it BEFORE our dinner. My husband is a manager of a sports bar and I am a server. We both know that the server could have done better but the manager should have handled the situation better. I am writing this review so this restaurant can improve the quality of service.

Mayra G.,"Gardena, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/15/2017,Worse experience ever. Service was horrible 1st  I had to ask my server for my drink more than two times before she brought it to me. Secondly I order a burger with sweet potato fries. When my food was brought my fries were cold like if they had been out for hours and old not freshly made. I had to wait another 15 minutes to get new ones. After that I had to wait again for me to get a refill on my drink. After that my husband and I order a mini chocolate chunk dessert and it was never brought to us. The server brought us the check before even bringing the dessert. We waited 20 minutes and asked her what was going on and how much longer it would take. Well I guess she never put in the order and said it would be right out. Well that never happened. I asked her to take it out of our check and she had an attitude about. Her response was well it's being made if you don't want to wait for it someone else can take it. What type of customer service is that???? So instead of taking it out the check she gave me a coupon for a dessert next time and said it will be out. I didn't want a coupon We waited another 10 and nothing came out. We finally left without our dessert and without the dessert being taken off our check.

Elle E.,"Downey, CA",0,12,,5.0,7/11/2017,"It's been a while since we had it but i remember the sweet pig pizza is very tasty. The root beer glazed rib appetizer is delicious but the regular sauce they put on their racks of ribs can be kind of spicy. The rib-eye steak is great. We order it medium rare and it is seasoned well and cooked as we like it. Their wedge salad, which is an old fashioned favorite that they do right, is great with plenty of blue cheese and bacon etc on top. We're beer drinkers and usually get their hefenweizer (i'm sure my spelling is off) but this last visit i gave my liver a break and tried the iced tea, it was okay...just iced tea...i missed the hef, it's a great beer. They have weekday deals and their $10 burgers are creative and filling. I like the fries; they seem to have changed over the years and now they look like they have a crunchy coating on them but are very soft and potatoey inside. We usually go on off hours and sit in the bar section and can say this location has attentive, informed, cheerful servers who never fail to enhance our meal. I would also recommend joining their loyalty program. There are tons of bj's so wherever you are you can tuck in for bite and the points add up quickly.

Joseph B.,"Malibu, CA",1,74,8,4.0,9/7/2013,"Came here Friday to have a cool drink and watch the Dodgers play. I sat at  the Bar as the booths and tables were occupied and since I was by myself, sans wingman DCR, being a conscientious, sentient being I didn't wish to monopolize seating that was intended for more than a single customer. Anyhow, Stacy was the Bartender and very attentive. Again, the BJs employees at the Downey restaurant truly comprehend customer service.  A customer walked in and sat next to me. He kinda resembled my wing DCR. I'll call this customer Mr. Oblivious. Anyhow, small talk ensued. he talked about getting ink of  a Unicorn with Patrick Swayze on the back. Creepy (this was the first omen). The Dodgers were winning, I ordered a second one.  Then....Mr. Oblivious receives a phone call. He starts talking while he is sitting at the Bar. His volume grew to the decibel level comparable to sitting front row at a Metallica concert. I discretely asked Stacy for some cocktail napkins and stuffed them in my right ear (Mr. Oblivious was sitting on my right). As his volume increased, I covered my right ear with my hand and still, his conversation was deafening.  The game was in the second inning when he received the call. When he ended the call, the game was in the 7th inning. All the customers around him were giving him evil looks, one Latina was saying a prayer hoping for some divine intervention to end the call (like the battery dying on his White Galaxy S3). The white phone should have been a second omen. How many 50 something, non metro, males carry a white phone???? Finally, the conversation ended. Hallelujah. Thank you Ms. Latina for beginning the Novena. Some of the highlights of the conversation (that  everyone in the bar was able to hear) were: The name of the caller - Sally and her relationship to Mr. Oblivious Her latest gynecological test results (she is okay, just a routine test, no UTIs) A Tamale recipe (the proper method to stuff a Tamale) The new iPhone 5 S/C The weather (SoCal heat wave. Really?, thanks for the update Genius) Sally's grandchild's bout with diarrhea (a young child should not eat salsa and chips) Miley Cyrus twerking at the VMA A recent sighting of a Pod of Orcas off Malibu Retirement Account options (401ks, Keogh/Roth IRAs, CDs, Mutual funds) The Kardashians new addition Nori West Aaron Hernandez' not guilty plea President Obamas options for Syria Favorite Reality TV shows (at this point my ears began to bleed). Thankfully the call ended. Mr. Oblivious  looks around and notices that I have napkins stuffed in both ears. ""WAS I LOUD?"" he asked From the other side of the bar area, Stacy, the bartender, responded, ""NO, BUT PLEASE SHARE SALLY'S TAMALE RECIPE WITH ALL OF US"". I finished my beer and left.  Kids, Today's experience of rudeness was probably on par with ""water board torture"" Thank you Mr. Oblivious, tell Sally that the entire restaurant wishes her grandchild speedy recovery with the bout of diarrhea... sigh, FML...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-downey?start=220

My boyfriend asked if they had root beer and she informed us that BJ's actually makes their own! Along with a few other flavors of soda which included cream soda, black cherry, and orange cream. I asked her about the watermelon mojito and she informed me it was super good and refreshing. Man was she right! I couldn't believe how delicious and super refreshing it was. I would've had 3 but I decided not to overdue it lol She then without asking, brought us samples of the other soda flavors. Which was awesome of her! Our food came out in a timely manner, and was soooo delicious! I had the ravioli with sausage and pepperoni, it's definitely my new favorite dish at the moment. Dessert was delicious as always as well, and my boyfriend and I just sat there talking the night away. We were never rushed and Melinda always remained attentive. She was even sweet enough to snap a picture of us when I asked her to. Overall the entire experience was great. Excellent service, super good food, couldn't have had a better time.

I just don't understand. ANYWAY this time I wanted the food but not the mediocre service so I ordered online for pick up....BIG MISTAKE....upon arriving at the mall I was unable to find parking ANYWHERE the 4 spots designated for BJs takeout were taken after I circled for a half an hour I called the restaurant to see if I could just stop by the designated spots and if someone could come out (since I saw online you also offered curbside service) I had the exact payment in cash...I was told no, that I could stop directly in front of BJs and BLOCK heavy mall traffic and run inside I explained that I would not feel ok with doing that to the public! What kind of person does that. I digress. Anyway she put me on hold for several minutes and then told me I could go to an alley behind BJs and park there. I didn't feel comfortable with that either but it was a better option then blocking everyone! Luckily on the way over there some of your takeout spots opened. Unfortunately the bad experience did not stop there, one of my hamburger buns was literally drenched in VINEGAR so gross, and the mustard and mayo I requested was not on the burger so I ate it with one bun and no condiments and the Brocc Cheddar soup bowl I ordered was more of a cup.

With me being extremely indecisive, he had to come around like 3 times before he could take our drink orders.. BUT each time he came by, he was just as courteous and patient as the first time. And he didn't disappear for a long period of time like most servers do. The timing was pretty perfect and I feel it was perfectly well spaced out! It's a kinda creepy-genius-this-guy-is-brilliant kind of thing. Enough time to leave you alone and think, but not too long to make you wonder if he got kidnapped or something (let's be real, here. You're all familiar with servers going MIA while you make your decisions.). Anyway, we seriously got our drinks (a beer and a strawberry mojito that will make you experience true love.) within 2 minutes! On a Saturday night! With a full house! It was fantastic!! Our appeteaser (stuffed mushrooms) was scrumptious! And came out at a decently quick time. Then we decided to also get some boneless wings to devour before ordering some food! They have a nice variety of types of sauces for the wings, and we chose an order of the teriyaki and an order of the garlic Parmesan. My goodness, those wings were delicious!!! The teriyaki had a slight kick of spiciness, yet sweetness, and had a very unique flavor, and the garlic Parmesan ones were really good! By this time we ordered another beer, which AGAIN came to the table in like a minute, and we also finally decided on a pizza.. Half buffalo chicken, and half 5 meat! Everything was so great!! Our food, and especially our drinks, came quickly and finished quickly, haha. David was really REALLY attentive the whole time, but definitely not too constant, making sure we were doing fine and that we had everything we needed. I was seriously blown away by how efficient he was!! When I was offered to have my water refilled it took like 30 seconds for him to come back with some. That rarely happens! I'm used to choking on my food and almost dying before getting my water refilled (at least at other places, but certainly not here tonight!!), and again, I'm sure many of you are familiar with the horrible service most people give. But not here! It was SUPERB and awesome service from David and great food. And that mojito!!!!!! I can't get it out of my head! Fresh muddled strawberries and mint, mmmm mmm mmmmm!!! It's a must try if you like fresh drinks with a slightly sweet note! Shoutout to David for being so efficient and friendly! When I go back, I will request having him as our server!! Happy eating!

My mom got the jambalaya, Boy were we in for a sad surprise. it was it god awful... like I literally have no words on awful this was...

Juan M.,"Montclair, CA",111,302,214,4.0,11/16/2014,"This review is for my visit on Thursday, November 6th. This is only the second BJ's I've ever been to, and so far, this is the best one because it is bigger and better lit. A few of us came by after the Long Beach VA Marine Corps Birthday cake cutting ceremony to throw back a couple and continue celebrating the birth of my beloved Corps. We got there, and the young lady told us at the front it'd be about 20-30 minutes and it was probably only about 15. We had leftover birthday cake and asked if they could store it for us and even though it wasn't in a box of its own anymore (it was what was left of the top layer) they were more than willing to store it for us, BUT did tell us that they couldn't be responsible for anything that happened to it since it wasn't covered. We thanked them anyway and decided to keep it with us. It made quite the conversation piece as people walked by our table to admire our ""unique"" cake, which was really, nothing more than an octagon shaped cake with the topper missing and a big ol' dent in the center. Anyway, more people decided to come join us, and we advised the wait staff, and they were more than happy to move us to a bigger area, probably because we still hadn't settled in and ordered anything yet, but I still that thought that was very cool of them. Moving on to the service, I can't complain. ALL the servers were very friendly and outgoing and it felt more like a backyard bullshit session than being in a restaurant. My only complaint of the night was that we had ordered some shots of Patron and a shot of Jack for the non tequila drinker and while the staff was very accommodating in chilling the shots per my compadre's request, when we actually did the shot, which looked like doubles by the way, we found the shots to be watered down, which probably explains why they looked so big. Now, some people might be fooled by this, but a table full of Marines and two Navy corpsmen know when their hooch has been hijacked!!!!! : ) This calls for like a free app or beer or something on our next BJ's visit, BJ's!!!! You guys deserve a do over to correct this discrepancy! HA HA HA..... As far as the food was concerned, no complaints there. Perhaps it was the good company, but it felt like the food came out right away. I ordered some bomb ass carnitas con chile verde fries and honestly, they could give Alberto's a run for his money! The deep dish pizza Doc ordered was good, although it wasn't very deep in the dish. Deep on flavor though. They even reheated it for us when the stragglers finally arrived to the party. Beer wise, I had the Oktoberfest and it was outstanding. Doc's husband got one of their beers closest to a Bud Light and he enjoyed it as well. If I lived closer, I'd probably come here more because of the outstanding service.

So, we decided to give it another try.  It was Easter Sunday, and surprisingly it wasn't crowded at all--we were seated immediately upon arrival, so we thought we had made the right choice. We didn't. After our server took our order, we got our drinks, and patiently waited.....while others nearby, who arrived after us received their food. I wish I would've timed it, but I'll say about 45 minutes before we finally flagged down our waitress (who seemed to be avoiding eye contact with us). She just said, ""your food's taking long, huh?"" She offered complimentary soup or salad, which we accepted.  Our food arrived soon after that. None of us complained to each other, but I know I was very disappointed. I will avoid putting my family through that again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-downey?start=240

Julia V.,"Paramount, CA",81,11,6,3.0,2/24/2015,"We usually go to bjs in Cerritos for wings and pizza of course! But we were near stone wood, so we decided let's give it a try. Here is how that went: Ordered wings: Received wings with ranch drizzled on top (this never happens at any other bjs we've dined at) Had to send the wings back because my husband doesn't like ranch. We were given another set of wings with ranch two more times. Finally we got our wings, but then they had no buffalo sauce on them and they came dry! Haha At this point we were so hungry, we just decided to ask for a lot of extra buffalo sauce to put over the wings!   Lastly I order tomato bisque soup that tasted and looked like pure oil with tomato juice. I couldn't even eat it.  I only give this place a 3 because the pizza and wings were cooked properly and tasted good, plus the server was trying to be helpful as much as she could, I guess.

Next time I will try the pizookie and pizza, can't wait! Also impressive was the handcrafted soda options made with beet sugar and natural flavors.

Jasmine M.,"Long Beach, CA",129,43,26,4.0,3/29/2016,"I love this place at happy hour, me and my friends will come here and just wreck it from 3-7 we find us a seat at the bar and make sure to enjoy a couple beers. I think I have come here more just to drink than I have to order food. The bartenders are super funny and are ready to serve you up another drink as soon as you are looking empty. I enjoy it when my bartenders give suggestions or tips on what to try or how to get the most out of your money. One of the bartenders asked if we wanted to try mixing beers and I thought to myself well that doesn't sound good. But whatever we went for it and it was pretty good, I can't remember what it was of course but it was a mix of two of their brews all the workers knew about it so it must have been an insider things. Also, we were a couple beers in when the bartender mentioned to us that it would be a little cheaper if we were to order a pitcher which would give us about 3 and and half beers and that way we could just go and chill for a bit. So we tried that, I appreciated that tip. I think we were really into trying a couple different brews though so we just stuck to ordered our beers separately. So anyways if you want to have a chill afternoon and drink some beer for cheap this happy hour is the way to go I just like the overall look of the bar itself too like the area surrounding it is so inviting it makes me want to stay longer!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-downey?start=300

Sarina F.,"Los Angeles, CA",94,101,48,3.0,3/16/2016,Ate here about two weeks ago. Food is always great and my husband and I visit different locations all over Southern California. Our server was very friendly and gave great service. There were a few things that happened out of her control. We ordered appetizer and entrees and he ordered a cocktail. The drink came really late like literally 30 seconds before the food. The food showed up and we didn't have the calamari delivered yet. He ordered ribs and I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. The calamari came after the food. Our server offered to take the appetizer back and off the check if we were unhappy that it didn't come first. We told her it was ok. I was not looking but my husband took a bite of calamari and a black long hair had been breaded inside and he pulled it out. We called our server and she immediately apologized and even offered to buy us dessert from her own money. We declined because the restaurant should do that. Not her. It was absolutely disgusting. One of the managers (seemed like from the kitchen) came out to our table and apologized and they took the calamari off the check. However we had left some of our asparagus side from the ribs on the plate so that got thrown away (we were sharing). The ribs however were tender and juicy and my spaghetti meatballs were a nice portion. It was enjoyable because I was with my husband and the rest of the food was great but we didn't really think it was handled properly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-downey?start=300

Patrizia R.,"Temple City, CA",86,52,259,1.0,5/16/2015,"I would give this location no stars if I could. Let me tell you our HORRIBLE (10X) experience in this particular BJ's. The first time BJ's was a disappoint considering I've/we've always been a fan/s. I believe this is a long overdue review since this nightmare happened last Mother's Day, May 10th. I wouldn't want to think that Mother's Day happens to be a very busy day or that weekend per se has been very busy which explains why the service & everything about it was poor (not even mediocre). That should never be an excuse for any establishment after all. The negativity of this visit was just one after another. It's like being shot with a series of bullets until you end up being completely dead since the situation never got better & they weren't able to alleviate the situation either. So here it goes: - We're a group of 6 & 4 of my friends have already placed their orders except for me & my husband. Server took them all & told her that ours will be to follow as I do not intend to eat anyway. Just deciding on what to drink. - Server came back a few mins later & my hubby placed his order too. Told her I still needed time since mine was just a drink & she could proceed with the rest of the group's meals. She asked too if she could go on & have everything ready for the rest of them & the response was clear as sky, ""Yes go on & have them ready"". - Server came back with my hubby's meal (which btw was placed at a later time than the rest of the group) & took/noted the drink I've decided to have. - Server came back with my drink but still without everyone's plates. - Hubby was almost finished with his meal when the rest of the food came (40mins tops).  - My friend who was extremely hungry by then b/c of the tremendous amount of wait time, received his order of Shrimp Alfredo WITHOUT SHRIMP or anything on it for that matter, just the white sauce. - Extremely disappointed b/c of this my friend called the server & told her about the plate w/o anything on it considering they had to wait for THAT long. My friend continued with her tirade mentioning that she doesn't understand why me & my hubby got ours first when we placed ours way later than theirs - To make matters worse, the server who obviously wasn't trained to provide favorable customer service, argued that the reason for the delay was because we (my hubby & I) took so much time to decide on what to eat or drink - (she was pointing at us) - Was too tired & defeated to react & tell her that she was told to proceed with everyone else's meals earlier on - She should realize herself that the proper way of dealing with customers is NEVER to blame them for their establishment's inefficiency anyway - All of us were on the same page. Too tired to care or bother. We weren't the irate customers who would've lambasted the catty server - Dinner went on peacefully & nobody talked about the failed shrimp alfredo until my other friend found a TOOTHPICK in her salad! Luckily she wasn't like me who normally doesn't look at what she's eating & would continue on poking leaves & ingesting it in her system. (I wish I took a picture but we were so defeated, disgusted, dumbfounded by what we saw & didn't realize the picture could've been handy for Yelp) - Luckily she took her time to eat & looked through what goes on in her plate. Otherwise she could've ingested a sharp toothpick (used? hope not) & God knows what's going to happen in her stomach  - We called the manager to complain. Told them about the series of letdowns. He apologized & told us that he sort of knew about the situation b/c the server told him that she felt that the whole dining experience already started off on the wrong foot. (Of course we were all like? What kind of an excuse was that?) - My friend no longer needs to pay for the disgusting salad she had but her nightmare didn't end there. She took my glass of water earlier & just when she's about to consume all of it, she found a dead bug floating in it!! DISGUSTING on so many levels! I was lucky she wanted my glass as I would've ended up drinking the entire thing w/o realizing there was a bug in it!  - We called up the manager UHHGEN.. & this time, we told him that none of us are going to pay for this dinnernightmare we just went through. He apologized & said he'll see what he can do. When he came back, we only paid for the alcoholic beverages my hubby & I had. - I wasn't happy that we still had to pay for something. I honestly feel that their establishment did not deserve a single dime from us. I thought if we complained about terrible customer service b/c the server BLAMED our drinks for the delay of the other meals, then our whole bill will be entirely free!  - And to add more insult to injury (while everyone in our group is still in the heat of the moment) our server came back acting as if nothing happened (no apology whatsoever), asked us if we WANTED BOXES! We were like what?! Box for the salad with a toothpick in it? Are you serious?! Haha that was dumbTERRIBLE",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-downey?start=320

Paint nite has about 20 people there and two waiters to service all the people. I understand that the poor waiters are overwhelmed but as soon as we got their we asked for the happy hour specials, the waitress mumbled through them and I didn't want to be rude so I asked her to repeat them. My other friend couldn't understand her at all so then she asked a question about a special, the waitress Danielle asked us ""are you going to listen now?"" Ugh yes we are. Whatever she never smiled and then a nice make waiter was switched with her. Enough not to tip her but it only got worse. We got our drinks and food almost at the end of the paint session, many mix ups with our food but the worst was when another friend asked for a spoon like 3 times, never got it so she stood up and went searching for one, a random waiter Andrew Ponce goes up to her and tells her ""here is your fucking spoon.""

Susie P.,"Baldwin Park, CA",0,6,,5.0,4/19/2016,"I frequent this BJs a lot, so I'm always happy when the new menu items come in and always saddened by the ones that leave (Cajun Pasta). But today I don't want to talk about food, I want to talk about service! I had the lovely pleasure of being helped by Adrian. I was completely BLOWN AWAY with his service and sincerity. It's not very often that someone takes the time to actually get to know you. He had me laughing the whole night and made sure that I was always satisfied when he went to go check on his other customers. I could even hear the other people laughing right across from me so I know I wasn't the only one. By the end of my visit here at BJs I was saying goodbye to a new friend, but it won't be too long before I get to catch up with him at BJs again. Thank you Adrian, and the management staff for hiring such a delightful person.

Catherine J.,"Downey, CA",35,23,6,1.0,9/1/2013,"This review is based on the most recent dining experience I had with my family. Previous experiences were always great but this time around my mother found something in her food that caused her to bleed.  When we got to this location, there wasn't much of a wait and not very many people. We were a party of six and we were seated in the middle of the aisle where two tables were pushed together. There were plenty of booths open and we felt incredibly squished in-between this aisle where customers were passing through as well as the servers.  We asked for a booth but apparently they were saving them for some customers that just walked which in that case, we should have been seated there first.  Anyway, on to the food. We all ordered different items but I'm going to speak specifically about what was found in my dads portion of onion strings. Now, my dad had not tried his onion strings yet but my mom grabbed the first bite of the finger food.  As she bit into the onion string, she bit into something hard. Then she spit out what she was chewing and revealed what looked like a piece of rock. As we looked closer, it had the color of ceramic so we thought she might have just broken her tooth. She was still complaining about a pain in her gums so I decided to accompany her to the restroom. That's when she pulled out another piece of ceramic that was stuck in the back of her gums. Then she started bleeding. We made sure to check if it wasn't a broken tooth and it wasn't so we returned to the table and I called the manager over.  We showed her the piece of ceramic and the damage that had occurred to my mom and she went to the back kitchen to speak to the staff. Once she left, we found more pieces of ceramic on my mothers plate and kept them to show the manager. When she came back, she told us it looked like a piece of tooth and we told her it wasn't because we already checked to make sure. We told her it looked like pieces of broken plate because the color of the ceramic was the same color as the plates that they use to serve their food. We told her that she should be aware that they are discarding broken plates right away and not serving anything to a customer if something had been broken.  She made my mom file a report because there was blood involved and she comped some of our dishes for us. We hope to never find anymore hazardous material in our food or to any other customers as it could potentially kill someone if they swallowed a piece of broken ceramic.  Be aware of the onion strings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-downey?start=320

We stuck it out and said we would be next, it took another good 20 minutes.  Our food experience was not so great either. We were greeted by a very rude waiter.

First off it took about 15 for us to have our order taken and that was only as a result of me flagging down the bus boy who was nice enough to take our order. When the waitress finally graced us with her presence and confirmed our order she left without asking if we wanted drinks, which i later had to flag her down for. Our order was simple...queso dip and chips, two coffees and the Pizookie trio: peanut butter, salted caramel and monkey bread. The queso dip made it to our table along with our two coffees that were accompanied by four cute little creamers. (Four creamers for two coffees...really? ) As for the Pizookie trio...at least they got one out of three correct, and my impression was that it's a common mistake because the waitress knew which flavors they mistakenly included. Maybe Bj's name comes from the fact that their service blows.

Add grilled onions... and by grilled I mean, if the Downey, California Fire Department shows up, then you guys did it right. The woman wrote all that down and somehow it came out wrong.  BJ's screw up number.... umm. Sorry but, I lost count. A member of their management team comes out removes the burger from the bill, subtracts 25% from the overall bill and still gives us the burger done right but, I had to take it to go or be late for a play in downtown Long Beach.  I am so tired of being disappointed by this chain... Really... Portland, OR... Beaverton, OR... Clearwater, FL (about 4 or five times), Citrus Park, FL.

Pooh Y.,"Downey, CA",0,10,,1.0,10/2/2017,"BJs as a franchise is awesome. I have been to this location many times but tonight was just awful. The food is always great but service is what makes or breaks the experience. Tonight was not busy but the wait for food and drinks was outrageously long. The server Yanira was rude and unattentive to our party of five. We asked for our checks to be split into three and her attitude went south. Our drinks took longer and longer to come out and when asked about a promotional deal, she was not happy. It's not like she is paying for the free pizookie, BJs is. All I can honestly say is that tonight would have been a descent night if we had a server who actually would do their job without such a bad attitude and a smile. Even a fake smile would have been fine with us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-downey?start=40

The drinks were ""stuffed"" with ice cubes resulting in a watered down experience. I ordered the barbacoa with cauliflower - the waiter explained that the barbacoa was not meat but simply a sauce. Well, the dish contained small pieces of chicken, no barbacoa sauce and not cauliflowers but pieces of cucumber. I know we should have returned both dishes but we were in a hurry.

Jessica T.,"Long Beach, CA",603,113,222,5.0,8/8/2016,"BJ's is one of my favorite go-to restaurants when I am craving American food. This location is big and clean. I've been to BJ's in Cerritos and Del Amo Mall and they all look the same. Service is always good at any BJ's location I have been to. If you had to try one thing I suggest their deep dish pizzas. It is so mouthwatering and delicious. The bread is so plump and fluffy. My favorite flavor is the BBQ chicken. I also love getting the pastas here, the garlic bread that comes with the pasta is delicious as well. If you want to try an appetizer I suggest the avocado egg rolls. For the beer, I tried the tatonka stout (8.5% alch) and it was great.  For dessert try the pizookies! They have multiple flavors and seem to have a new flavor on the menu every so often. The pizookie is a freshly baked hot cookie with icecream on top. It is the perfect combo. The cookie smells so fresh and every bite is amazing.  If you come with a big party there may be a long wait, so I suggest calling ahead and making reservations. Also, if you come here often you should sign up for the BJs rewards program. You accumulate points after every meal and can get discounts or free pizookies depending on your point value.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-downey?start=40

I've been to several other locations and never had such a great experience. Our service was amazing. Angela was very attentive. She brought refills early, extra sauces before we even had a chance to ask and even had a stack of napkins on our table before our food arrived. When you eat out with 4 kids you never know what kind of service you'll get. Sometimes children turn a server off and they try to ignore the kids completely, not Angie! She spoke directly to our kids and let them order for themselves which they LOVED. She had a smile on her face the entire time and never appeared frustrated even though she had several tables in her section.  We ordered an appetizer sampler, large deep dish pizza, BBQ chicken salad and a guacamole burger on special. Everything was very good and cooked exactly how we ordered it.  The only unfortunate thing is that we don't live in the area and the BJs closest to us has never been impressive. If you live nearby, definitely eat here!

Vanessa S.,"Riverside County, CA",0,9,1,1.0,8/23/2015,"Ok so let me start off by saying I've been to multiple locations of bjs and I've never had an issue, until this past weekend at the Downey location. I went on a Friday night at around 9:30, my boyfriend got us a booth at the bar section and the waitress seemed very nice, a few minutes later she came to tell us she was done for the night and a waitress who's name starts with a ""D"" was gonna serve us for the remainder of the night, ok fair enough. She asked if we were ready to order and we said we needed a few more minutes. She didn't return for about 20 minutes if not longer. She hardly even made eye contact with us so we couldn't wave her over. Once we made eye contact with her we waved and she took our order. When the food came, they didn't give us utensil or napkins so we waited about another 15 min for the napkins and utensils. We really felt like she was purposely avoiding us. We thought maybe it was because it was only the 2 of us at a booth and that annoyed her, I really don't know. That night we were there from 9:30 to 12 am, we would have left earlier but an hour if not more was spent by us waiting to get service. In the time we were there the waitress only stopped by our booth 4 times, all 4 times because we had to wave her over. This girl made it so difficult just to get a beer. She would walk past our booth and wouldn't make eye contact with us or asked if we were doing alright. I've never experienced this at any other bjs. We weren't rude or obnoxious, we sat quietly at the booth so I still can't figure out why she would be avoiding our booth. And no, it wasn't overly busy that night, it was a regular Friday night type of crowd and we noticed everyone else at her section was getting served. I'm very disappointed especially since I love the bjs franchise. Not cool bjs, not cool at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-downey?start=400

Angel C.,"Downey, CA",0,10,2,2.0,6/13/2013,"So, we had a high school grad that decided he wanted to eat here. Let me start by saying that the hostess said it'd be a 30 minute wait. Of course, an hour later, our large party started getting frustrated because we were told they were waiting for two girls to finish eating  to clear up an area for us. Surprise, surprise-- they finished and then sat another party that arrived after us there. As we asked why that happened, the manager told us they honor reservations first. Wtf, she could have said that before pissing us all off. The staff simply doesn't know how to communicate clear expectations with their clients. We were finally seated in two separate areas. Our waitress was ok but seemed too stressed for a large group. I personally had to ask 3 different employees, including the manager, to change a channel to the Dodger game.They all said yes and never did. I hate to be an AHole, so I let it go. Other TVs away from us had the game going. So this is what prompted me to write this review and knocked a few stars down in the service department. The manager did send some courtesy avocado egg rolls after we ordered. That was kind of her; she later did come to apologize about the fiasco. However, you can't excuse poor service because the restaurant is busy. Later, we got a different server to replace our first, and he was great! He even brought out complimentary deserts for our graduate. I was at one star at the time. The food was average. My cheese and tomato pizza wasn't any better than Pizza Hut's, but the beer and wine was good. The prices are reasonable as well. The environment was clean but I personally don't like to be surrounded by cholitos, so I'd go elsewhere. So if you want great service here, don't get your hopes too high.

Lu C.,"Downey, CA",1,9,,1.0,8/11/2015,"I went to BJ''s Downey for lunch today and was not happy with their service and food. Let me start by saying we arrived there around lunch time walked straight to the bar and sat ourselves down. We were approached after a couple of minutes by a server and were asked if we were ready to order and we were so we did, that was the end of our good experience. I ordered the soup and salad, I had requested extra cilantro and avocado on my soup and neither happened when it arrived I asked my server that I had ordered extra cilantro etc. and she's basically arguing with me that I already have extra on my soup needless to say I told her to bring me more..she did finally. My kid ordered the kids Alfredo/broccoli pasta and it had a big hair implanted on the dish next to the pasta I called over the manager and he agreed to make another one  which but at which point I was already done with my meal. They had the audacity to charge for my kids meal in spite of the huge inconvenience. What I failed to mention was the fact that it was my sons birthday and with all the time wasted we had no time for his pizzokie which he was looking forward to.

Parking is obviously ample since it's Stonewood mall and the service was pretty fast during a busy lunch hour. The pizookie is great, the service is well above average, and the beers are actually high quality.  I'm looking to try a beer flight during my next visit to a BJ's.

It had corn and beans which gave it a great taste perfect for the summer. Just is. Our appetizers were good. Calamari was fresh and it was not chewy. Now comes the bad part. I would have given this place 4 stars, but the hostesses sucked! I don't know what it is, but good looking hostesses who spend half their time talking to their friends who work with them instead of greeting people and making them feel welcome is my pet peeve. It would be nice to walk in and be greeted, instead of waking in and waiting to talk to someone to be seated. I really don't care about eye candy at the front door.

Our waiter disappeared halfway through our meal, never came to check on us or ask if we wanted to order pizookie (which originally we wanted to do) it wasn't until we were finished with our meal ready for boxes and brought boxes until we were asked if we wanted to order pizookie. Naturally we said no because we're aware pizookie takes a while and it was already approaching 11 p.m. After he dropped off the boxes he disappeared again for 15 minutes before coming back to ask if we wanted additional boxes we said no and he told us he'd bring back our bill. It wasn't until 11:28 until he brought back our crumpled up bill. By the time we got out of there it was close to 11:45.

I am not sure why I continue to frequent this particular restaurant. Each time I come to this restaurant I have encountered such poor service and incompetent servers. The wait time is horrible even if you call ahead and they give you an estimated time you will still have to wait the time they tell you when you actually arrive. So there is no point in calling ahead. Today my son and I decided to come because we haven't been here in quite some time and figured something should have changed since our last visit but no it is still the same. We decide to sit in the bar area in a booth as suggested by the hostess as service would be quicker. But no, we sat at the table for 11 minutes (yes, I timed it) before I had to go and complain before we were even greeted or offered drinks. Seriously? 11 minutes that is ridiculous!!! So finally they send someone over to greet us and apologize. We ordered our drinks and food as my son always orders the same thing. But the food takes even longer which is surprising since the place was practically empty. The food was overcooked and dry. Very disappointed:( My son didn't even finish his food.

I would absolutely recommend booking a party at this particular BJ's.  It's easy for guests to find, there is ample parking, and the management makes the process very easy.  We were able to come in 30 min. ahead of time to set up decorations.  They did a great job seating other customers away from our party, to the extent that they were able to.

My boyfriend ordered their infamous root beer but much to his disappointment, they ""ran out of chilled mugs."" Therefore, they brought out the root beer on ice, diluting its goodness.  Next to us, we had a large party finishing up their food. Our waitress drops a dressing container on the floor which explodes over to our side, splattering my boyfriend's $200 pants. She apologizes once (only once) and informs us that she will let the manager know. (side story: another waiter spilled an entire platter of melted Pazookie ice cream on my bf a couple months back) We order the rest of our food. The large party next to us has a drunk idiot who is yelling at his friend to leave the restaurant. For about 20 minutes, he yells out, ""HEY YOU! GET OUT! GET OUT!"" Servers and managers just walk on by, not dealing with this unruly customer. Then, he creepily stares at me and tells me to stop smoking. I don't know what the hell he was on, but I wanted to punch his Raider loving face in. Long story short, the Happy Hour mini pizza was good as always.

Amanda C.,"Norwalk, CA",0,8,,1.0,1/16/2014,"This review is for my visit last Monday night. Although I expected it to be busy, what with football and everything, the restaurant was surprisingly pretty empty. Despite that, the service was HORRIBLE, nothing compared to my other visits and definitely upset my family and I.  We sat at the bar area and at first our waitress seemed attentive and friendly, but this quickly changed to her being forgetful, rude, and neglectful. She messed up our drink orders twice, ignored our table to chat with and kiss up to (for lack of words) the two tables on either side of us, completely ignoring us and making it so we had to flag her down repeatedly. To make things worse, she argued with us when we asked to have something changed because she didn't tell us everything when we asked her specifics BEFORE ordering it. It was clear we didn't know about it when we asked her specifics, and I found it unprofessional of her to not be clear initially, be argumentative when we told her she didn't tell us, AND to try her best to make it our fault so as to not have to change it. And when she changed it, she STILL messed it up! By then, we had had enough. My boyfriend and I always love to tip (and generously, might I add), but even he was upset when I suggested leaving a tip, flat out pointing out that she had been sucking up for it from everyone else and didn't need it from us. I felt bad, but he was right. I'd suggest going to the cerritos location instead. But if you really have no other choice, just avoid the bar area if you can and opt for the dining area; I've had better service in the dining area from a trainee there, and that's not saying much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-downey?start=460

My wedge salad came, but by grandson's did not.  I asked about it and waitress said it should be coming soon.  Well my definition of soon was apparently not the same as hers!  it came more than 10 minutes later -- plus we still hadn't received our appetizer!  Hello -- did our waitress notice?  No! My burger and the waitress grabbed by salad plate -- Hello, I'm not done with it; she didn't even ask!  Where was my grandson's order? Why can't they grill 2 burgers at the same time? and our appetizer? As my grandson's burger arrived, the waitress did not offer us any condiments; we had to ask for them and we also had to ask again for our appetizer.  She left to check on the appetizer and came back with the answer ""the kitchen lost the order"" hmmm.  She offered to still fill the order if we wanted which we did (WHY?)   The appetizer arrived luke warm -- probably was sitting waiting for her to pick up and deliver to our table!   Waitress didn't offer any reasonable explanation nor did she offer to comp us anything.  Not good!  I gave her a minimal tip -- she was nice and cordial just lazy and non-attentive!

Kirstie M.,"Downey, CA",7,12,2,1.0,5/6/2015,"The worst customer service experience I've had with a restaurant ever. My boyfriend and I came to the location about 1045p and waited about 15mins for a table which was not a problem to us at all. We were seated and our first round of drinks came quickly. Our server did not come to the table for about 15 mins before he took our order which again was not an issue. Our server came back 10mins later and said he lost his checkbook that had our orders in it and needed to take them again. At this point we were a bit frustrated with the timing of everything. It had been about 30mins in and no food and our drinks were empty. I ordered a salad and requested that it come prior to our food. 45 mins had passed and our server was no where in sight. The restaurant was not crowded and there seemed to be a good ratio of servers to tables. The server finally came back after 20mins and said he was so sorry about the wait and that he would check on the food. He asked if we needed refills when he saw our empty cups. He came back with refills like 5mins later and said nothing to us. A table of four that was sitting across from us that was seated about 15mins after my boyfriend and I received their food first and one of the plates was exactly what my boyfriend ordered.  at that point we had been waiting for almost 1hr 30mins for our food. We were very hungry and did not receive the best customer service. I am fully aware that BJs is not a fine dining restaurant but, the expectations is that a customer can at least receive their food in a timely manner. I ended up stopping the server and telling him that we are just going to pay for the drinks and leave. There were three servers in the front just laughing and talking to each other while a few tables were patiently waiting for their plates. The server came by maybe three times max. To make matters worst the server was like I talked to my manger you don't have to pay for your drinks and did not show face. I myself am a manager and work in an elevated customer service environment and I make sure that when there is a situation that I personally rectify the situation and ask the customer if there is anything further we can do. The manager never came by or wanted to speak to us. My assumption is he was the only older guy wearing a blue collared shirt that was hanging out in the front of the restaurant talking to the hostess. It was by far the worst experience I've had at a BJs. We ended up walking down to Buffalo Wild Wings and had a great experience there!

Generally friendly staff, from the Maître d' to the busboys. I would like to apologize to all who have rated BJ's or any equivalent restaurant higher than my 3 star rating. Restaurants of this calibre, in my estimation, cannot really be reviewed any higher. If you've read some of my reviews and noticed some of my ratings, one would perceive me to be inconsistent. Not so! I will rank a hole-in-the-wall located in an unpleasant part of town higher based upon what they offer with respect to the specialty of the art of their cuisine and at times, value. I have had fabulous meals at restaurants with lower Health Department grades than B, or even at some places people wouldn't even dare set food in because they have a numerical grade, being on the cusp of closure! So why only 3 stars? BJ's fall within a generic restaurants category. I suppose if I were a connoisseur of (handcrafted) micro brews, I would rate this place higher, but I'm not one to consume alcoholic beverages. Having dined here in the past because friends couldn't settle on anything else, I've tried the pizza, flat breads, avocado egg rolls, calamari,  stuffed potatoes, salads, burgers, pizookies, etc...nothing that I would say, ""wow! I need to be here every day/week!"" food is A-OK. Service, again is generally good. Facility is clean. My menu was a little gross, as each page was sticky! :-/ At this visit, I was with a group of 20. Several pizzas and appetizers were on order. As a side note, I'm quickly determining that pizza in today's vernacular bare resemblance much closer to focaccia! If I want pizza, it has to be thin crust. If I want thick crust, I'd order focaccia. I'm tired of seeing these super thick, deep dish pies labeled as ""pizza"" and thin crust being labeled as ""flat bread""! Maybe I'm a bit critical, but I needed to vent! I ordered the Field of Greens Salad with Chicken along with a bottle of Pellegrino. They only stock one size of Pellegrino. I was surprised that the bottle was the tiny 250 ml bottle! As for the salad, it was tasty, but may have had too much dressing, at least for my tastes. My final thoughts....BJ's is a perfect place for teeny-boppers and 20 somethings, strapped for cash wanting to feel grown up. I'd venture to say they cater to the same demographic whom consider The Cheesecake Factory the pinnacle of culinary excellence! If you do a little investigating, you'll be surprised to find just how many restaurants there are around you offering a more excellent dining experience at a similar price point.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-downey?start=360

Today was bad, I walked up to the hostess and asked how long the wait was, she said 30 min. I said oh not too bad and gave her my name. As we were approaching the 30 min mark I started noticing that people who walked in after us were being seated. I approached the hostess again and asked how much longer the wait would be, she gave me a blank look and said you didn't give me your name and I thought you went to the bar. I said no, I gave you my name right after you said the wait was 30 min. After looking around she finally said you will be seated shortly. There is no way she didn't see me waiting.

The next table that sat next to us during the 2 hours we were there got seated and had their food in 35 minutes. I started timing table to see if it just wasn't us. Sure enough people around us were coming in and out and we were left to hang. I guess our money is not as green as everyone else's. I asked a lady who looked like a manager to check on our food because we hadn't been served in an hour and she just said, ""that's unacceptable."" Really?

Michelle L.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,20,10,3.0,6/20/2011,"Tried the Saturday Brunch. No wait, they opened at 10 & at 10:30 we were the first people there thus seated immediately. We were a party of 7 but the hostess gave us only 1 brunch menu so we had to go ask for another.  Our beverages came quickly but we waited forever for our waitress to come back to  take our order. When the waitress finally came back, she was very unfamiliar with the brunch menu which she repeatedly told us. As we ordered, she peeked over our shoulder reading the item to find out what side items came with the meal. When my dad asked for wheat toast, she said ""I don't think that comes with toast."" He pointed it out on the menu and she felt the need to once again tell us she was unfamiliar with the menu.  If someone is unfamiliar with the menu, should they be repeatedly advising customers of that? No. Should she be waiting on more than 2-3 people? No.  When the food came, another young lady assisted her in delivering our plates. Not very good service on that end either. When I told her she had my plate,  instead of walking around the table to place it in front of me, she decided that handing it across the table,  crossing over the heads of 2 people, was a good idea. She just passed it over to me! This is ridiculous. How can you cross a plate over 2 heads? How difficult was it to walk a few steps over and place it on the table, which I'm sure they must have been trained to do??? I looked over at my sister & we both said ""What the..."" Overall the food was decent, as to be expected from BJs. The staff could use a little more training.

I've already heard and read bad reviews about this chain in general. I was hesitant to try it and even more so when I was told that there's a 35 minute wait. What?! I wasn't that hungry anyway so I decided to stay and get this BJ experience over with. A table opened up in the bar area so we decided to go for it. By the time the server came over, we were already ready to order. Got a deep dish pizza. I wanted to see how it'd stack up against the Chicago deep dish that I liked. After almost a half an hour wait, the greasy fluffy mess they so called a pizza finally came out. Actually, it wasn't so messy since we opted to not have the chunky sauce. The first bite was a disappointment right away. I finished off my slice since I was already hungry. All this time our server vanished so we had to order from another server. I wanted a Midori sour. Waited for a good ten minutes or so when our server came by and place my drink to the table next to us. WTH! Good thing the other table refused it and told the server that it wasn't their order. First sip. Hmmm. There was something off with the concoction but I couldn't quite figure it out. I don't drink regularly but I know how my Midori should taste like. It looked like it with its signature green color but didn't taste quite like it. I liked it anyway because the alcohol was strong.

No drink refills we didn't even see our server.. For a long time.. So the people with soup and salad were not able to enjoy their meal with us because they got their meal first and the server was not around to get them seconds. Finally the server comes around with water only, no refills for kids drinks or anything, soup and salad was requested at that time and boy that was a long wait for it come out.  We also order dessert for the kids and wow that took long too, Then some friends were walking into the restaurant we invite them to join us, they ordered soup and salad,, we order dessert to keep them company, our dessert took long too, and some people got the pazzokie first and one person got it once everyone was long done with their dessert their food took long to come out and when it did they were not given any napkins or forks so another wait, they needed more soup and salad could not find server, finally she comes out and we have to request seconds, which took to long, that they had to go and take it with them, they were in a lunch break..

A group of 5 went on 9/11/11 and this is what we found. First, there is a new corporate policy of no audio of the NFL games. Instead you get to hear the standard background music just loud enough to make it hard to hear those around you. That makes watching the games difficult, but what is excruciating is the poor service and general ""why are you making me work"" attitude of the staff. Some examples include : We never played the audio of the games. Otherwise everyone would be trying to get their games on. -oh you haven't decided yet? -when the food didn't come out, the manager was nice but the waitress would not accept reponsibility and just put it back on us saying ""well I kept asking if you needed anything..."" terrible. -when asked if the coffee could be warmed up, the waitress tried to convince us it was hot because she burned her hand... nonsense.

Patrick A.,"Downey, CA",5,9,57,4.0,5/2/2010,"I have been a fan of BJ's since I was turned onto the Brea location.  When I heard they were going to add one to the Stonewood mall I was afraid that it would be the ""crammed into a mall space"" situation like the Montebello store. I was pleasently surprised to see that it is a corner space with a lot of windows and nicely laid out. The menu has a large selection ranging from standard bar-food (sandwiches, wings, nachos) to salads, extra large potatos and their famous deep dish Chicago style pizza.  Everything I've had has been good to very good. As this is a brew-pub I must make mention that their house brews are all tasty but this location in particular also has an impressive collection of non-house brews on tap (european, belgian, and american micro-brews).

They had a spot where you can walk-in, make the transaction, and peace out! Back to your oh-so-lovely 9-5 routine.

The manager came over and apologized and asked us if we wanted anything else.  Well, I wanted the check but my friend was hungry and so we order the sliders and the spinach dip.  The sliders were very dry, almost choked.  They never brought us ketchup or any kind of sauce to put on the sliders.  The ordeal  continues, when Alex our waiter brought us our drinks, he spilled my drink all over me and never bothered to come back to check if it had been cleaned.  So we asked him to clean it up and bring us some ketchup, well that really made him so mad that when he brought us the ketchup,  he slammed it down on the table and angrily wiped off his mess.  As Alex was cleaning, my friend told him thank you and he didn't acknowledge her so she told him again, she told him 3 times and just ignored her.

Sonia R.,"San Francisco, CA",11,23,1,1.0,9/9/2009,"I understand that this place just opened, and that maybe the majority of their staff is inexperienced... but come on. First, the spacing in the restaurant is very crammed.  There is a section of individual tables runs down the center of the restaurant... but because they're crammed in the middle of the booth section, it doesn't leave much room for someone to walk past this.  Best part of this is, you HAVE to walk through it to get to the bathroom at the other end.  It feels like you're walking down a movie theatre aisle;  you don't want to give your butt to someone to squeeze on by, but you don't really have any other choice.    Second, I'm not sure if they were understaffed, or if the waiter just didn't know how to manage his time, because the couple at the table next to us saw him about 5 times before he even decided to check up on my table.  I sat through my entire meal without anything to drink because our waiter never followed up with us.  NOT cool.    Third, its located at the Stonewood center in Downey.  This place already has enough commotion going on with the Acapulco restaurant in one corner, and the Olive Garden in the other.  The parking lot to this place can barely cater to those going to the mall and those two restaurants mentioned, and they add ANOTHER restaurant?

After carefully researching via the World Wide Web, I discovered BJ's was actually a dining restaurant and well established across America.  So we ventured on a Friday night and at first glance the presence of the restaurant can be a little overwhelming but you'll get used to it since hundreds of germ-filled citizens will be surrounding you. Since we accidently didn't have reservations, we were handed some sort futuristic contraption that would repeatedly blink red, implying that an empty table was suddenly liberated. The menu looked ordinary so I wasn't blown away by their selections. The food although was exceptionally delicious - it better have been considering it's Bruce Wayne expensive there! When it comes to the appetizers, one necessity I'm going to add is to try the astonishingly delectable Avocado Rolls. You will NOT be disappointed and I will take that advice to my grave!

I said I would like a pink lemonade. One coworker got a strawberry margarita and the other got a blue moon and we ordered an appetizer and pizza.

When she came we asked where it was and she was like oh you ordered an appetizer ?  We were mad but we let it slide and told her the appetizer. A few minutes later a bartender said that the computer was supposedly broken and needed our appetizer order. We were furious so we went and talked to a manger and explained to him that we didn't want anything free but that we were servers and that the service was so bad so he said he would bring our appetizer out. After we ate our appetizer she came and dropped our bill off without even asking if we needed anything. So we asked where our pizza was and her face was in complete shock because she had forgotten. She took the bill and left and had a different server come to us and say that the computer was broken and that they needed our order again so we told the manager that we weren't going to pay for any of it and he said that it might have been because she was having a bad night.

Only downside was that our server was not attentive. My friend had to keep on looking around to find our server to get her drink refilled. Towards the end, she even raised her hand to get his attention. What are we, elementary school kids trying to ask if we can go to the bathroom? If you are a server for a big group like 12, you should check more often, not just abandon us. Once again their food was okay. Not that decent. Its just same for all the other BJs locations.

Gina G.,"Los Angeles, CA",209,66,165,2.0,3/2/2016,"My boyfriend and I were looking for a place to eat and I suggested BJ's since we'd both never been to this place before. We arrived and walked into a small section specifically dedicated for take-out and only take-out. I guess we weren't paying much attention when we walked in and missed the fact that there are two entrances and both entrances are for two  different things. The man behind the counter cleared our confusion and led us to the hostess. We totally felt like dorks.  Our nice hostess asked if we were okay with sitting in one of the booths to which to we replied with a yes. I really liked that she asked us first instead of just sitting us anywhere. Im pretty sure this was mostly due to the fact that it was a slow day and most tables were unoccupied anyway.  Our waiter took no time to head towards our booth. He was attentive the entire time and kept the refills coming. To start off we ordered the avocado egg rolls appetizer. The egg rolls were all right. I wasn't too fond of the overly mushy texture but my tastebuds enjoyed the flavor; the tangy sauce was amazing too. For our entrees I ordered the Hickory Smoked Brisket and Bacon Burger while my boyfriend tried their new Baked Deep Dish Ziti. My meal was merely okay. It was full of flavor but there was not much of a wow factor to it. My boyfriends Deep Dish Ziti on the other hand was phenomenal. I kept sticking my fork into his plate (sorry not sorry). Half way through our meal our waiter informed us that he was leaving and that another waitress would be taking over. The waitress was just as attentive as he was. Awesome customer service.  Our appetizer and entrees took quite some time to come out. Hunger doesn't know patience and neither do I. I didn't understand why our food was taking so long since it wasn't very busy that day.  I don't know if I see myself returning to this location again. I see a lot of reviews raving about pazookies and other dishes so I'll keep that in mind, but theres definitely better out there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-downey?start=60

April Y.,"Buena Park, CA",260,532,254,1.0,5/3/2015,"I've been to numerous BJ's, and this is by far, the worst one.  My family and I get here on a pretty busy night- NFL Draft and, Ducks playoffs, and Clippers/Spurs Game 6. We were expecting to catch the various games on TV while we were there. Upon entering, we noticed there was only ONE screen in the bar and just a few TVs around the restaurant. The one screen showed 4 different channels, but the NFL draft was shown larger than the other 3 channels. The smaller screens were barely visible from the bar, so we requested our server to change the setting to make it all the same size. Once the screen sizes changed, it was so much better. However, due to the higher bar tables, it was so hard to see the games because of the heads blocking our vision. This location really needs to add more TVs throughout. It's a pretty small location, but there should be at least two more TVs in the bar. What is a disappointment.  On top of that, our server at the bar was awful. He barely came around to check up and did not smile once. However, we ended up with another server when our original server went on break.

Jess G.,"Downey, CA",349,349,1553,2.0,4/14/2015,Their burger is alright. It was salty and some patches of the burger were extra saltier than other patches of the burger. I don't think it was worth $7.75.  During a weekday lunch rush they didn't have anyone at the take out counter yet they had 3 hostesses at the hostess/seating counter. I had to wait for one of the busy servers to notice me and give me my order. How to fix the problem? Train one of the 3 hostesses kickin it at the hostess counter to also do take out orders and that would take a load off of the servers. This wasn't the first time I've had timing issues with this BJ's location. They're either understaffed or being managed by time insensitive managers. Another time I went to dine in during a lunch break and actually had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. Another other time I was there for 3 hours on a Saturday night with a large party.

We ordered chips and guacamole which took a while to get. We order three top sirloin steak dinners ($23). All medium well. We received burnt steaks instead! Talk about to quality control. It amazes me that someone can serve these and think it's ok. They even smelled burned. Anyways, of course I asked for medium well steaks and sent these back. My granddaughter was too hungry to wait so she ate hers which was the less burnt of the three. Our waitress didn't bring out the steaks and promptly took the steaks back. Needless to say I'm very disappointed. The wait was just too long for my taste. Paying over $100 for a party of 5 with no alcohol, you should at least enjoy your meal. Sucks when half our table is finished eating and two of us are still waiting for our food. Our waitress was great but the kitchen staff needs a lot of improvement. With so many places to choose in Downey, you would think that management would keep better tabs on the kitchen crew. By the way this was a Monday evening. 3rd pic was replacement steak which was much better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-downey?start=20

Offered good recommendations for us both we kept ordering. He was friendly, good sense of humor and always checked on our table. That's what customer service is all about.

Tina H.,"San Bernardino, CA",181,348,2265,4.0,5/7/2017,We have come to this location with our kids a few times it's very kid friendly. Kids can defiantly be kids so go a head a let them be loud! all of or food came out at a normal speed:) so it wasn't to long to wait for a table of 7  We all enjoyed our food half of the family liked the pizookie and some didn't care for it. But all of our meals were to our liking no complaints here. Staff are usually very friendly and very helpful! (We have got a bad apple ever once in a while but not to many!) That's are 1 point deduction for a few bad apples. Other than that we are happy customers:),https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-downey?start=20

Joseph W.,"West Covina, CA",2,8,,5.0,11/8/2017,"Every time me and my family come here, the place is always filled with people but we still get to sit down and enjoy our dinner. The place isn't very loud like other restaurants and that's what I like about it. Also the food is delicious and we don't have to wait that long for it and when we order dessert, we always get their famous pizookes and they are very warm and delicious and they never disappoints all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-downey?start=20
Marlene R.,"Downey, CA",6,5,2,1.0,5/12/2017,"I'm not one to yelp bad reviews but I want to share my experience at BJ's because it was poorly handled. I ordered a salmon salad and I noticed a dead fly in my food. I immediately let my server know and he was very dismissive of what I said. He walked away and said ""Well this is not our fault"". I expected him to come back or the manager to my table to address the situation but NOBODY ever came to apologize on behalf of the restaurant. My server Daniel T just dropped off the check and didn't acknowledge what was going on. I am truly upset with the service at this restaurant, let alone the hygiene that takes place in their kitchen!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-downey?start=20
