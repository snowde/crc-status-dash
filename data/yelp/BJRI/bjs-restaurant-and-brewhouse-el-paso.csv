Ashley S.,"El Paso, TX",2,10,9,4.0,12/17/2017,"Usually a little slow but tonight was quicker than usual. Their soups are really delicious but normally arrive on the lukewarm side  Tonight I got a mini pizza, and its totally worth any wait. I've had Chicago deep dish pizza, and this pizza definitely is a good substitute for El Paso",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-el-paso
Estefany M.,"El Paso, TX",26,186,179,3.0,11/10/2017,"Dined here on a Wednesday night. The restaurant was very empty with just a few tables with customers and a few individuals at the bar. Our waiter was great, he was very friendly and informative, providing information about their main dishes and his opinion/suggestion on menu items. I ordered the Peruvian shrimp quinoa and my husband had the seared ahi salad. In addition we ordered two alcoholic beverages with a mojito and a BJ's Irish root beer. I enjoyed the mojito and thought it was very good! As for the BJ's Irish root beer, I was not a huge fan. It was too sweet for me personally. As for our main entrees, the ahi salad was delicious, fresh and super healthy! My dish- the Peruvian shrimp quinoa, was also delicious! The mixture of quinoa with shrimp was fantastic- it just had an excess of lemon for my personal taste.  We finished our dinner with the pizookie with churros- a seasonal special! It was delicious and highly recommend it if you are an avid fan of churros- like myself! Overall, service was good, I was unhappy with my alcoholic beverage for the amount I paid for the BJ's Irish root beer was not worth it, not tasty. Save your money instead for a desert. I thought the Desert was much worth it in comparison to the drink.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-el-paso
Jay B.,"El Paso, TX",66,221,325,3.0,8/13/2017,"Some people would describe BJ's as a high end Applebee's or Chili's. Me? I'm not so sure. This is actually a tough review for me to write because BJ's has always been one of those places to me that...doesn't quite fit a perfect little slot. Plus, I think it's a bit pretentious to call them ""high end"" anything. But...let's talk about this in detail, because it's not like this is a bad restaurant or anything. Truth is...it's actually been years since we last visited BJ's. We're fairly certain the menu was given a major overhaul since the last time we visited (which must have been sometime back in 2006 or so). I couldn't even tell you what I ordered back then. But I'm certain it didn't compare to the hand pulled turkey dip, which was freakin' phenomenal, btw! I was impressed by the fact that they used carved turkey rather than thinly sliced turkey. The horseradish was a nice touch, too. Not too overpowering at all. But before I could have the meal, I ordered some clam chowder. The wife also got her favorite: the tortilla soup. Wanna know what these two bowls of soup had in common? Whilst they both tasted good, they were also both unfortunately served lukewarm. My question is: what the hell happened?! It's as if all the soup warmers in the restaurant were broken and they decided to have some kid toss it in the microwave in the back; only they put it in there for 10 seconds instead of 30. I'd have sent it back to get a much warmer portion, but by then...the main course would have already arrived and I wouldn't have wanted any more soup at that point. Such a shame. I was a little surprised to see that the decorum hadn't changed much at all since I last visited this place. Then again, they *are* technically a chain. They have a revolving door out front. I don't think I've seen many restaurants with revolving doors, but okay. Not a deal breaker for me...just...weird. Once again, I have to point out the delayed and dubious service here. Though not outright bad per se, it seems more like...hit or miss. Towards the beginning, the server was alright. But it initially took 10 minutes after seating before we were even acknowledged. And then at one point during the course of the night, it took ages to get refills for our drinks. Not sure why this is such a huge problem. Perhaps they're understaffed, but I wouldn't know. I'm not the manager. Ultimately, the prices for what's served here seem reasonable. I'd recommend BJ's to folks who are looking for gastropub food that's slightly different from the typical neighborhood family restaurants such as the aforementioned at the beginning of this review. Still, I don't feel as if they compare even remotely. I would certainly go back and try one of the burgers or maybe even the fish n' chips. For right now though, I'm giving BJ's 3 lukewarm bowls of clam chowder out of 5.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-el-paso
Brian M.,"Queens, NY",1155,1121,7054,4.0,12/1/2017,"As a New Yorker from the city (Manhattan!!) I refused to and rarely ate at chain restaurants until the Army brought my ass to El Paso because I'm a proud supporter of local businesses. However, after being stationed at Fort Bliss for over 3 years, I think I've eaten at every chain restaurant there is in America lol. That being said, my first encounter with BJ's was on Veterans Day. I was never in America during the months of November (Deployments hello??) so I figured it would be the perfect time to snatch one of those Free or Discounted Veterans Day Meals and picked BJ's because the menu online looked decent and I didn't want generic Applebees or Chili's bullshit. Well guess what? Turned out to be a success!! Seriously never knew this place was a chain until I looked it up on Wikipedia! The food was contemporary, above average, although slightly hipster. The place has a nice vibe too. For occasional drinkers like myself, they even have their own version of Sparkling Sodas (I always get the Cucumber Mint one which is light and refreshing). I came back the other night for dinner and it was consistent and satisfying. Definitely one of my favorite 'chain' restaurants in El Paso!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-el-paso
Charles Y.,"Chicago, IL",259,216,216,4.0,7/17/2017,I called for reservations and was told no same day reservations. Im not mad about that...I was just expecting long wait time and trying to get over...LOL We went on a Friday night so I was expected a 30 minute wait. Nope we were immediately seated and only a portion of our party was present! Server for the night did a great job. The food was on point. I had combo deep dish and it was so good I was happy to have some left for the next day. If you looking for a deep dish pizza in El Paso then this is it. If your a thin oven baked kinda person then there is some good alternatives in the area.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-el-paso
Jose D.,"El Paso, TX",0,23,27,3.0,6/20/2017,"Today's visit was a bit disappointing. My wife and I went for a late lunch. Our menus were dirty (almost every page) with old stuck pieces of ""whatever"". I had to comment to our server. The salmon was excellent. The Parmesan crusted chicken was less than attractive. It tasted stale as if the chicken had been in a freezer for quite some time. The ceaser salad was good (not much can go wrong here). We also had desserts to see if we could salvage lunch and fortunately we did. I would come back as I've had better experiences here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-el-paso
Eddie G.,"El Paso, TX",0,14,13,2.0,6/18/2017,"Well, previously, the description of this restaurant from me has always been good and satisfying.  But today on Fathers Day has been not an exciting event for myself.  The wait time was respectable and seating was nice from our waitress. The establishment cleanliness is a 3 out of 5 today sad to say. The drinks we all ordered were made nicely with no complaint. But ultimately, the reason for eating out was a letdown- the food was not as good as it normally holds as for a higher ranking. The Shrimp and Asparagus Penne was very sad and disgusting! The mini pizza I also order was good as always. All around, the food was below average. The steak was not cooked to order and was bland. The ribs were underwhelming. Their ""premium sides"" weren't worth the money. Makes me think they have new cooks or the current cooks just don't care about sending out good food anymore?  The only reason I'm rating this a 2 star is because the waitress actually tried to help. The manager came to the table but the visit was so brief, I was not able to give him my feedback. I'd rather send my friends and family to Cheddars next time as I will be certain to spread the word to the 1000 members I work with. Word of mouth can be very impactful!  Definitely very disappointed in this establishment.  We will not return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-el-paso
Cindie B.,"El Paso, TX",103,28,10,5.0,6/9/2017,I have no idea why I waited so long before coming back because this place is the BOMB. large restaurant so we didn't have to wait on a Friday evening (impossible with little kids) and the food is AMAZING. Best fish tacos (grilled) I have EVER had. The prime rib special on the weekends is a great deal (comes with desert and the cut is huge) and super delicious. My kids love the spag and meatballs and fun to try the flights of beers. will not wait so long before going back.  thanks to BJs for another great experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-el-paso

My best friend and I, were the last customers to leave because we were having such a wonderful time talking to her. Regardless of her many tables, she managed to tend to every single one of them, kindly and in a timely manner. We ordered the turkey burger and the portabella mushroom burger (being a vegetarian), along with deserts, and an amazing brussel sprout appetizer. We loved everything so much that a to go box was not needed, and being surrounded by wonderful people and superb decorum, encouraged us to stay and finish everything off.

Lisa C.,"Honolulu, HI",1,31,27,4.0,10/7/2016,"I was meeting a friend for dinner and she arrived before me. She informed the hostess that I have a service animal (thinking she should, but she didn't really know better either) and the hostess sat her in the very back table stating it was to keep kids away from my SD. When I arrived I was a bit confused by learning this since my SD is my responsibility and I do not require ""special seating location far from all other patrons"" when I go anywhere. I've never been out to eat and had anyone go under my table to attempt to pet my dog. That is just awkward and I am very capable of correcting someone or addressing a parent.  The table was round  and awkward for my SD to tuck under since she had to try and curve her body around the bench and table leg. We made it work though. The server was nervous and asked if my SD bites because she is afraid of dogs. I'm sorry but if a SD bites it probably isn't really a SD to begin with. I tried not to be snarky in responding to her since she didn't know any better (apparently) and that was that. I prefer to educate rather than be rude but I was already irritated for being seated near the kitchen under the excuse of ""kids"" might touch my dog.  Aside from the SD issue, the food was amazing. I ordered the baked ziti and it was delicious!! I believe we had nachos for appetizer and that too was very good. So 5 stars for the food, 4 stars for the service. Please teach your staff to ignore service animals and unless special seating is requested by the handler do not take it upon themselves to think we want to be isolated from the rest of the restaurant patrons.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-el-paso

Eddie P.,"El Paso, TX",21,122,290,4.0,6/6/2015,"I always enjoy coming to BJs because of the environment. I feel like I'm not in El Paso. I know sometimes a lengthy menu is painful to look through but their menu is full of good stuff. Most of the appetizers are really good. I've sometimes had my full meal of appetizers. Must try the avocado egg rolls and the corn fritters. The drink menu is extensive as well and the best part is that they brew their own beers. I usually go for the Jeremiah Red which is a red Irish ale. They are famous for their Piranha Pale Ale which is actually featured in a dish as part of the chili. The pulled pork sandwich is always really good and it's really big too so beware. On this particular visit I ordered the New England Clam Chowder on a sourdough bowl......amazing. Definitely a must try. Their pizzas are really popular too and have so many options of toppings and crusts as well.  However the wait times at BJs always extend longer than predicted. I got there early to get a table for 7, they told me 25 minutes and we waited an hour and a half almost. We ordered our food quickly but it took another hour to get the food. I always think it's due to high volume of customers but even when it's dead I've had to wait a little longer than my butt sitting in the chair likes. The service however is great and the food always makes up for the wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-el-paso?start=20
Tanya Y.,"Chicago, IL",1420,699,3712,4.0,8/21/2013,"People forget BJ's is a chain restaurant. Think a better, high quality Chili's or Applebee's. As you might guess, BJ's is my first pick when choosing between chains. This BJ's feels very open with its 3 different areas (bar, main dining, and a dining area past the window/doors) and its high ceilings. TVs are conveniently placed around the restaurant, usually showing football, baseball, basketball or tennis. Watch your step when walking to the main dining area - I've seen at least 3 people trip and fall on the stairs. There are larger booths that could probably seat 4-6 comfortably, but they also have booths for 2. The smaller booths are roomy enough for sitting, but if you're ordering a lot you may have to start condensing plates. And even though BJ's is higher priced, anything you would wear into a Chili's is fine in here. In a huge chain like this I don't expect a culinary genius to be in the back preparing my food, however I am never disappointed with the dish I receive. In fact it usually exceeds my expectations. The last time I was at BJ's I ordered the Fish and Chips. Delicious. The fish was cooked properly and perfectly golden brown all around. I'm pretty sure their batter is made with one of their own beers. When getting any dish here with fries I almost always order the thin, crispy ones but if you like some more oomph to your fries they do have waffle fries I believe. Some of their dishes are a little different than what you'd expect (i.e. the Mac and Cheese comes topped with pieces of a cheese cracker...perhaps Cheese-it's or Goldfish), but the menu does outline the dishes so you shouldn't have any surprises. The menu is extensive so you're guaranteed to find something you like.  It seems like they have endless amounts of drink possibilities. Yes, it's a brewhouse so you can order many different beers and specialty drinks (some that change with the seasons), but they also have specialty sodas (I love the cream soda) and other drinks worth a try or two. All the staff is really nice and knowledgeable. I almost could've given this BJ's a 5 star, but service isn't always the fastest. The fact that they have no problem to immediately rectify any issues you may have without making it a huge ordeal is almost redeeming though. And although it is a chain, this is definitely somewhere you should try when in EP if you haven't been to one before.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-el-paso?start=20
Angela P.,"El Paso, TX",29,2,,2.0,1/30/2016,"Okay let me start off by saying we have been here before and the service was good and so was the food but DO NOT come if you have a party bigger then 4. We had a 10 top table and we were treated like crap since we walked in. We waited over an hour and a half to be seated, to only get a table by complaining to the host.  Once we were seated we waited 15 minutes before we got our drinks and placed our order after we waited about 20-30 minutes. As the food was coming out one order was wrong which is not bad for the party size but then they burnt the steak another person in the party ordered and tried to bring it 20 minutes later after everyone was finished eating. After that they brought the bill and tried to give us a discount on it instead of stating that they were at fault and compensating. And for the wait no one a apologized and the company did not give a rats ass.  The server herself is the reason this gets another star because she tried and she took care of items on the bill to make up for the lack of the company. We will probably never return, just because the company sucks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-el-paso?start=20

Edmond L.,"Orlando, FL",23,180,373,1.0,11/10/2014,"Ate here back in July with a buddy.  Food came out quick, accurate and service was good.  It was a weekday and we went for lunch so it was pretty slow.  Pleasant experience. Flash forward to last Friday, November 7th.  Came here with a party of 6 for dinner.  Server, forgot his name but he looked like the scientist from Terminator 2, failed to write down our orders and decided that he could memorize 6 orders from memory.  Okay, we'll see how this turns out... I said to my wife, ""he'll probably be back a couple of times.""  A couple of times was an understatement.  Despite coming back to the table about 4 times, he still go the orders wrong by bringing the skinny fries instead of the wedge fries.  Mother in law ordered a half rack of ribs with mashed potatoes.  Her food came out cold, potatoes tasted like they came out of a box.  Friend ordered a full rack of ribs, they were flavorless.  The food was sent back.  Mother in law decided to get a burger instead since my 2 buddies who joined us got burgers and they didn't mess those up.  Friend decided not to chance it and just ate the chicken wings she ordered as an appetizer. What about my food?  Remember how I said the server failed to write down our orders and waned to memorize everything?  He forgot to put my order in...  In all, I got my burger 1 hour after sitting down.  And he brought skinny fries instead of the wedge fries I asked for.  I just about lost it.  If it weren't for the fact that I had a light breakfast and an MRE (Meal Ready to Eat) for lunch and was starving, I would've just asked for the check and went to Taco Bell or some place cheap where you would expect them to mess your order up. Manager came over, apologized profusely for the cold food and orders being wrong.  I suggested to him that maybe the server should have a pen/paper to write down orders. The only good thing that came out of it was that my food, my mother in laws food and my friends food was not billed. Also, parking was sorely lacking.  Restroom was clean, though. My first experience here was good but the second experience here was bad enough for me to not go back again.  After driving from the west side and hitting traffic on I-10, it turned out to be a 1 hour commute.  It's simply not worth taking a chance again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-el-paso?start=20

The veggies had a heavy hand of butter, but I ate them all :-) and finally the salad was amazing! It had a balsamic vinaigrette that was perfectly portioned on the salad for a nice kick.  For the beer: fantastic! I had 2 flights (4, five oz samplers per flight) and my favorites were the red and the Hefeweizen. Close runners up were the IPAs.

A large group of us came here after my sister's graduation, and we were luckily able to get a table for all of us on a busy Saturday night without a reservation. Good thing the restaurant is so huge!  I really enjoyed that they have delicious house wine for around $5.00 and a great beer selection (obv). We ordered the avocado egg rolls, and they were OK, a bit rich for my taste, but I loved the spinach artichoke dip. It was SO good and not greasy like most of them are. I loved it!! I had the chili as my dinner and it was pretty good. Not super memorable but not bad either.  Our waitress was excellent and kept our drinks full and plates cleared.

My husband's looked as though someone had sat on it before plating it. My bacon was burnt to charcoal and my fries were stale. The BBQ sauce that they put on the brisket tasted more like syrup than BBQ. I had to pull my burger apart to even try to finish it.

The portions of food are plentiful and I had enough pasta to last for two additional meals.  I ordered the Shrimp Scampi pasta with extra shrimp and my husband ordered the chicken limone.  Both were good.  We were a little less impressed with our appetizer (tuna poke sashimi) but this was El Paso after all and I seriously doubt if they fly their fish in fresh every day.  The tuna was the right color but had none of the traditional poke flavors you'd expect.

One thing I really appreciate about this BJ's over other locations is the atmosphere, it is, for whatever reason, just a little bit above sports bar casual, which makes watching the game here a little more enjoyable (READ: folks aren't as rowdy).  Huge screen with multiple games, and they all combine to make a MEGASCREEN for Texas Longhorn games, understandably so.  Hook 'Em! \m/",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-el-paso?start=40

My husband got the shrimp tacos and said the shrimp tasted precooked as well.

I had a Lemon Drop and it was surprisingly fantastic.  Food, on the other hand, is awful. We ordered a deep-dish pizza which was all bread and didn't even come in a deep dish or any dish for that matter. We also ordered the boneless wings, which ended up being soggy little nuggets that were nearly inedible.

The seats at the bar are great for viewing games, and the other tables and booths are for a more refined dining experience. I had the parmesan chicken and it was crispy and juicy with great sides. Two other's got the BBq bacon pizza and were enjoyed. They brew their own beers. Ask for their seasonal selections as those are usually the best ones. At under $5 for a pint the price is right too.

Jana T.,"Lorsch, Germany",94,94,16,1.0,6/2/2013,"A group of us went to the El Paso location on Friday night, 645pm. We were 7 and our waitress was Jennifer. Food was great. And that is where it stops for the good. The service was truly the worst I have ever seen there. It started with incorrect drink orders went on to extremely slow refills. We only had appetizers and wanted a few to go orders. I had asked for some balsamic vinaigrette for my flatbread. It took two reminders and 25 min to get it. By that time the flatbread was cold. While waiting, another waitress brought me some soup which I declined to receive because I wanted to finally eat the flatbread (still waiting remember) and did not want cold soup. The to go orders put in by separate waiters because Jennifer seemed totally overwhelmed. The manager came to us several times, saying he would see what was going on. When one lady in our party asked for a dessert, Jennifer wanted to bring us the checks before we had more drinks and dessert. Who does that? We declined saying we were not ready for the checks (you realize we said checks as in plural) and she insisted that it would be easier later. Really, who cares, make your system efficient and quit rushing us. By the time we were ready to leave, she forgot to put in another to go order and it took another 1 hour and 10 minutes for us to receive our checks. We finally left at 2145 after a few drinks and appetizers. When we told her now horrible the service was she slammed the pens on the table saying she can't do more than one thing at a time. The manager also made medicre attempts at remedying ghe situation. Jennifer never apologized knowing that her service was the worst ever and the manager told me that he had another waiter tell him that Jennifer would be in need of help with our group. I asked him why and he actually incenuated that we were problem customers because he thought we were a party who must have been there the week prior. I have no idea where he got that idea but it had been a good 5 months that I had visited BJs with any friends. Jennifer got zero tip from us because our dissatisfaction was purely based on her horrible service and the manager needs to get a check up for not making it right and making poor escuses.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-el-paso?start=60

Most of their prices are reasonable. I wouldn't suggest getting their sampler platter it was pretty skimpy for $18. If you ordered 3 appetizers separate I feel like you would get a better deal. My husband really enjoyed their ahi tuna little appetizer plate. Mac and cheese was ok, would not order again tho. Watermelon and feta salad is out of this world. I enjoyed their deep dish pizza, but that is because I'm from Chicago and don't really appreciate paper thin pizza. Their white chocolate almond raspberry pizooki is an absolute must! The coolest part of dinner was their rootbeer and cream soda served in a frosted mug, awesome and delicious!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-el-paso?start=80
Misty E.,"Fort Worth, TX",32,22,26,5.0,10/14/2012,I love this place! I've only been here since Aug 15th and I've been there quite a few times. The regular margaritas on the rocks are great and the alcohol sneaks up on you lol. The food is outstanding. The full rack of ribs I was expecting to be something like chilis or cheddars but no...they were huge and hanging over the edge of the plate. The baked potatoes are huge. The desserts are delicious!!! They have smiley face fries for the kids and mac and chz too! The pizza here is great as well!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-el-paso?start=80
Nicholas V.,"El Paso, TX",10,118,5,4.0,9/24/2010,"Great beer selection and huge menu.  To me this place is great for someone that likes Applebees or Chili's but is looking for a little more variety.  You get the same chain comfort with a better atmosphere, food selection/quality, and a better bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-el-paso?start=80
Amanda G.,"El Paso, TX",12,45,87,1.0,7/5/2011,"Awful place...My husband and I walked in and the hostesses were engaged in conversation amongst themselves for 5 minutes before they even asked how Many people were in our party. We sat down at a dirty table, in uncomfortable seating/arrangements the waitress who took our drink order not only didn't come by until we were seated for 10 minutes but had someone else  bring our drink order, which was incorrect; after glancing at the menu for sometime and not seeing our server comeback to take our order we got up and left. I will never set foot into that restaurant ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-el-paso?start=80
Jenna L.,"Florence, AZ",35,369,88,4.0,7/22/2010,"I have eaten at BJ's in CA and AZ, and this one is just as nice.  Location is kind of crazy to find on gateway in with a BUNCH of other restaurants/ shops.  Very nice building, plenty of parking.  Friendly staff at front of house and server.  Had Avacado Eggrolls, Mozzarella Sticks for apps.  Yum.   Small Caprese salad and mini Spinach and Artichoke pizza for dinner.  We all shared the Pizookie Trio for dessert.  OMG!  Yummy cookie flavors with ice cream on top.  We loved peanut butter cookie w/vanilla ice cream and the triple chocolate.  We also had the cookies and cream - good as well!  Between 8 of us we didn't finish them all! Microbrews good as other locations.  Overall, great experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-el-paso?start=80
Ann G.,"Blythe, GA",1,267,1,4.0,3/27/2012,"I really, really like this place. Unfortunately my stomach tends to disagree with me. I'm SO FULL whenever we leave! I can barely get out the door. That may be because I can barely get in the door, but I digress. I usually order the broccoli soup in the bread bowl. They really should just break down and call it a broccoli cheese fondue. It's VERY thick and VERY cheesy, so if you're looking for a thin broccoli soup, go elsewhere. I've enjoyed everything I've had there, though, and we've been four or five times now. Service is sometimes a little on the slow side, but they're friendly!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-el-paso?start=80
Ivan T.,"El Paso, TX",47,64,46,3.0,11/7/2013,"I have been to BJs on numerous occasions and have always enjoyed excellent, friendly service and delicious food. My favorite dishes to order are their pizza (Mediterranean is THE BEST) and their Parmesan Crusted Chicken. I recently tried their margaritas (Peach and Pomegranate) and they are delicious and fruity (they do not skimp on the liquor here, folks). My only problem with BJs is that during my last visit the waiter was rude to my partner and I towards the end. He all of sudden did not like that we asked for a split check. Also, he forgot to add the points of my check to my rewards card and was hard-faced when he said good bye to us at the end. Fortunately I spoke to the manager after the experience and he was very attentive, and assured me he would speak to the waiter. I am wanting to try out new, local places, so very likely I will not be back at BJs in a while for the sake of experiencing different restaurants. Avoid this place on weekends since it gets extra packed (sadly, it seems it's the ONLY trendy place here in EP, so everyone and their mother goes there for dinner on Fridays).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-el-paso?start=80
Happy J.,"Glendale, AZ",17,192,15,1.0,3/23/2009,"The host, who was leaning over the reception desk, was on the telephone when we arrived. Our entrance wasn't acknowledged for several minutes to a point where my companion said if no one noticed us quickly we would leave. We decided at that moment to eat in the bar area. As soon as we started to walk to the bar, the host decided to get off the phone.  We escorted ourselves to the bar area and sat at a tall table. It took a few minutes for our server to greet us and even longer for our soft drinks to arrive. It was my friend's birthday, which I mentioned to our server. She had a blank look on her face and asked if we wanted an appetizer. Obviously, either she or the restaurant don't make a big deal about someone's birthday. We ordered the nachos as an appetizer and they had a strange taste and informed the server of this. She apologized but left the uneaten food on our table after taking our dinner order. When dinner arrived, our server took the uneaten nachos away. Portions were small and the taste was okay. We had to flag down a different person for drink refills. My companion noticed our server spent as much time texting on her phone as she did using the cash register. That was also a reason it took a while for us to get the final bill. Both of us were surprised to see the appetizer off the bill as our server never mentioned she would do this.  We had heard of BJ's Restaurant and had never visited one until this visit. Overall, we're not planning to visit this BJ's restaurant again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-el-paso?start=80
Michael C.,"El Paso, TX",8,36,11,4.0,4/2/2012,"Well we did go at 3- pm on a monday which is not a busy time. Seating and food was prompt. Shrimp tacos, maybe there should have been a third taco?  There was a good amount of shrimp on each. The wife's fish and chips were good, hard to mess those up, really good sized portion. Atmosphere was nice, normal expected for a chain. It's way up on the hill so be ready for the El Paso wind.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-el-paso?start=80
Jenna W.,"Colorado Springs, CO",58,113,8,4.0,1/13/2012,"I was a little nervous to go here due to the previous reviews - I was not expecting much.  I went with a big group (reservations of course) and the service was very friendly, they were clearly prepared for us, and everyone seemed moderately pleased with their food.  I split the lettuce wraps with a girlfriend, as she had a fussy infant and we were not sure how long we would be able to hang,  The price was a little rediculous ($11 for an app? Of mostly lettuce? Hmm) but it was good- of course we ran out of insides long before we ran out of lettuce lol. I think it was a good venue for the event and I will be back, maybe not constantly, but I have not been scared off completely.  (it reminded me of Rock Bottom Brewery a little bit)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-el-paso?start=80

Beer was still good, burger was good, fries were good.  It was still A-OK but now I have more confidence in their food and wouldn't hesitate to go back, whereas I was hesitant to go this time.

Jessica Y.,"Chicago, IL",31,254,24,4.0,1/21/2009,"Apparently there are BJ's Brewhouses in Dallas and Houston, but this is the only one I've ever been to and I had to put it on the ""yelp map."" The thing that put this meal over the top for me was the pizookie. Yeah, so it's a horrible name, but it might be the best dessert that ever hit my lips - and I dine with A LOT of people that love their dessert. The cookies and cream pizookie is out of this world. A huge chocolate oreo cookie with three scoops of vanilla ice cream and oreo flavored mouse a top. I'm a fan of under baked cookie, but this was in the same ballpark, with a much better texture - you have to try it!  Otherwise, I think the big draw of this place is the huge menu and the neighborhood atmosphere. My friends , the El Paso natives, tell me it's always busy at BJ's, and I can understand why. It's just a well thought out layout and an unpretentious atmosphere. There could be a few more TV's, but you can definitely go here with a group and have a great night.  About the menu, it seems like they are big on the pizza - Friends recommend the buffalo chicken, which I must admit is pretty darn good even though I'm not normally a fan of spicy food. There is also a great selection of salads (I had the BBQ chicken chopped - reminded me of CPK - another favorite!). There's also the standard appetizers, potato skins, nachos, etc. And a great mixed drink menu. Even though I didn't try the beer, I do know that, DUH, they brew their own. There's a lot of info on their brews on the website - they look like they are pretty serious about it!! On a side/slightly related note, I saw the Dallas location had a brew/food pairing night, maybe they have these in El Paso too?!? Another bonus on the location, there's a cute little shopping center surrounding it. If you live in El Paso, I'm probably not telling you anything you don't know. If you're just visiting, head to BJ's for a great meal and a fun night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-el-paso?start=80
