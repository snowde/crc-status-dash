Aya E.,"Sacramento, CA",419,217,423,4.0,12/17/2017,"My party of 4 and I stopped by for an early dinner around 4pm and it turned out to also be Happy Hour (3pm-6pm). You have to sit at/by the bar in order to buy from their Happy Hour menu. I started off with the calamari (~$12) as an appetizer. As my main dish, I got the BJ's Brewhouse Burger with fries ($6) + cheese ($1.50). The burger/fries combo is part of their Happy Hour and for $6, I must say it's a super good deal! I was also in the mood for a light drink so I went with the Kona Big Wave pint (~$6). Service was decent but the food was really good! It was definitely more of a comfort/cheat meal but it hit the spot, so I can't complain! BJ's is a good spot for large groups and because they have such a wide variety in their menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove
Jef T.,"Elk Grove, CA",4,1,2,2.0,12/31/2017,"I ordered the Chef's special on the menu and enjoyed the meal very much. However, come to realize that once my credit card charge was processed, that the waitress charge me more than I indicated. I am very disappointed with the level of integrity displayed. I did not speak with management as I did not want the miss to loose her job. But the temptation of extra tips is certainly an unjust action.  In sum, be wary and pay with cash.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove
Karli D.,"Elk Grove, CA",91,340,768,3.0,12/14/2017,"So, this restaurant is just a convenient place to eat at times simply because it is open late and they have craft beers.  I am not a huge fan of this chain restaurant but it hits the spot on occasions.  Usually I either get the chicken bacon ranch deep dish pizza or the chicken tortilla soup and house salad combination.  The staff is so-so and sometimes there is a long wait for a table (try to grab a spot in the bar area as it is open seating).  I do think the happy hour is decent and they also offer happy hour during all pro football games which is a major cost-saving plus.  Overall, just mediocre food and service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove
Kali D.,"Elk Grove, CA",462,391,3861,2.0,8/27/2017,"Again I have tried so many times with BJ's but they always seem to fail us. I received an email advertising a 6 pound wing special for the Mayweather fight, for $28. I thought this was a great deal and I placed my order online. About an hour later I received a call from a manager at BJ's wondering when I want at the wings?? Well let me think... The next day when the fight is going to begin like I put in my order? She proceeded to tell me that the order was already made due to their error in the system, basically my order was the fourth one done this way. So she update my order to reflect the next day at 5:30 for curbside pick up and apologized. They donated all the orders to EGPD. Fast forward to the next day, we arrived at 5:30 on the dot and pulled up to the curbside space. I called the phone number to request they bring out my order, I was advised it would be a few minutes. OK we can wait but when our wait turned into over 10 minutes I started to get frustrated in 104 degree weather. I gave it another five minutes and hobbled my butt into BJ's. I was so pissed and hot that I think I let a cuss word fly out and demanded to speak to the manager. I explained how could you make a order the day before but you can't make the order on time today? Also all these folks are sitting curbside in these heat, that's not good for us or our cars. She apologized and said they were a bit overwhelmed and gave me $30 in BJ's gift cards. Basically my wings for free.  I'm only giving BJ's two stars instead of one because they donated the wings to our local police department and they did seem apologetic. Ugh!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove

Shyelle S.,"Sacramento, CA",137,11,,1.0,1/9/2018,Had the worst service ever by Jacob. This waiter sucks. Not only is he super slow but he's rude. We ordered drinks and he was in another room eating pizza. Once our food came it was brought out by another lady and he didn't come check on our table once. Then at the end of our dinner we asked for drink refills boxes and he disappeared again. He finally came back to our table only to ask if we would like boxes. So he pretty much forgot about our refills too. I understand that when it's busy people can forget things and Im totally okay with that..but the restaurant was super slow today. When he gave us our check he threw it at our table. He was the worst waiter I've ever had and i will never return to this location thanks to him.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove
Jay K.,"Los Angeles, CA",231,315,569,4.0,6/7/2017,"I'm a fan of BJ's I can't help it. The experiences have ranged, sometimes the food is so overly fattening I've been left with a tummy ache and other times I've had really memorable experiences.  I came here for my brother's graduation and used the app they suggested to be put on a 'waitlist'. It's not really a reservation since you can't do that unless you have a party of 7 and over, but it's somewhat like priority seating?  Obviously being in a small town where the HS is from Elk Grove, a majority of the kids and families actually ended up back in EG at this BJ's. It was PACKED. Wow, I heard the waitress say the wait was upwards of an hour and thirty minutes, but because we had used the app around 8:00 and gotten to the restaurant around...9:40 (?) we were actually seated within about ten minutes. Parking was a hassle because of how busy it was, but normally it isn't.  Our waitress was great, super friendly and accommodating to my family. Major plus for her.  We started with calamari, which I unfortunately stayed away from because ya know diet. Meh. And then we also had the avocado egg rolls, which my mom and dad both love. They were pretty spicy, at least for me. Good though! I also had a virgin mint mojito, because no calamari but I will down a glass of simple syrup.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their food. I got one of what seems to be their newer bowls, it had salmon and quinoa in it with veggies. It was actually not bad! Loved the salmon and ended up pretty full. I didn't finish all of my salmon, but did some decent damage. The brother had his lovely spaghetti and chicken thing, mom had a burger, dad had a mushroom vegetarian burger thing and my aunts had dishes I didn't try and forgot about. The important part is, no one sent their food back and everyone was happy.  We ended the night with two chocolate chip pizookies. They have some sort of Wednesday deal where the original ones are half off. I didn't hear anything she said after that as I furiously decided which one I wanted to buy for 50% off. I'm glad we got two, we have the family members who just want a taste, but seem to consider half of a dessert 'just a taste'. Having two satisfied four people well.  Overall, great experience. It also helped that the atmosphere that night was exciting.  A lot of families celebrating graduations for their kids. While it wasn't our first option, I am glad things went well for us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove
Kelly L.,"Sacramento, CA",305,50,96,3.0,5/19/2017,"I've been to BJ's countless times for all types of occasions. Just to eat, birthdays, dates with friends/SO, etc. However, I have been going less frequently because the service here is increasingly inconsistent. Sometimes the service is great, sometimes the service really sucks, like really sucks... This used to be the go-to spot for birthdays within my friend group but I'm really glad that we out grew that.   One of my favorite dishes here is the Southern Fried Chicken (pictured). I also really like their Jalapeno burger. Too bad they don't have the crispy thin fries anymore!!! (or that's what they told me last couple times I went, I'm heartbroken). And of course, who doesn't love their pizookies! I'm actually really craving one now that I'm thinking about it!   Those dishes are the main things that keep me coming back, but I usually just get all of those things to-go now a days to avoid the inconsistencies with this particular location. But BJ's as a whole is a good place for lunch/dinner. Be sure to sign up for the email/club. They often do buy one get one free entrees and free pizookies with purchase! So if you like BJ's, be sure to get on that. And on their rewards system! I always forget to tell them to add my points when I pay! Oh, another comment - I do like that they're open late. Sometimes I don't want to go for fast food but most restaurants are closed. So I've had a few late dinners here. So that's a plus.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove

Harvey K.,"East Bay, CA",4848,491,2810,4.0,3/8/2017,"I had a pretty good experience at this BJ's today. So a few of you know that I'm a basketball referee. For California high schools, their version of March Madness (state playoffs) is here. My crew was assigned to a game in the Sacramento area yesterday. Our original plan was to go to Stagecoach Restaurant for our pregame meal, but we arrived 15 minutes after their closing time. BJ's in Elk Grove became our backup plan at the suggestion of one of my crew mates.  This BJ's is located in a big shopping center right off the Laguna Boulevard exit of Highway 99.  We walked in at around 3:30pm and the restaurant was pretty empty. We were prompted greeted and seated by one of the hostesses. The interior was very clean and the design appeared very similar to other BJ's locations that I've been to.  One of the servers came by with menus and took our drink order. Since we were kind of in a hurry, we quickly ordered: - Broccoli Cheese Soup (small, $4.75) - Chicken Club Sandwich ($11.75) - Late Night Burger (Wednesday special, $10) - Hickory Brisket and Bacon Burger (Wednesday special, $10) - 2x Diet Pepsi ($2.95 each) - Root Beer ($3.25) Food didn't take too long to arrive. I had the brisket and bacon burger and it was pretty decent. The patty was cooked to a perfect medium and seasoned well. It was topped with chopped brisket and two strips of bacon. The light bun held together despite the heavy ingredients. The fries were crispy and delicious. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. My two partners liked their food as well. PQ, who had the broccoli cheese soup and Chicken Club Sandwich, told me both were very good. ES, who had the Late Night Burger, appeared to like his food as well. His burger came with a fried egg, bacon, and pepper jack cheese. A liberal amount of chile verde was also a part of the burger. ES told me he loved the sloppiness of the burger!   Service was very good. Two servers constantly checked on our needs and refilled our drinks. With T/T, the bill came out to $56. Not bad for three people! I'm usually not a big fan of chain restaurants but my experience at this BJ's today was a pretty good one. But with that said, it is unlikely I will return to this particular BJ's because I'm not from the area.

I explained what happened to the person who answered and she apologized and transferred me again.  OMG!!!! It happened again!!!

Nick S.,"Sacramento, CA",39,77,113,4.0,2/25/2017,"My go to place now for anything really late night in Elk Grove. We went here again last night an hour before closing on a Friday night and there was plenty of seating with the choice of the bar or booth. Though it had plenty of seats, it was still decently filled with people. Never really have to worry about parking since the lot is huge, unless you like to park close.  This night, service was great and the mixed drinks we got were awesome. We had gotten the strawberry freeze and a strawberry mojito. The freeze was sweet and yet the alcohol was a hit still. The mojito was also very good, could sit there and order a ton without realizing we would get drunk. I got my usual California chicken club which is always a hit for me. The chicken is moist and the avocado is fresh. I usually get extra sauce in the sandwich but this time it came with a perfect amount. The other order was the bj's house burger and was pretty good itself if you didn't want bacon or cheese. I'm only knocking a star down because the pizza hasn't been tasting as good as it used to be. The usual bbq chicken had very little flavor and chicken itself.  If you're looking for a late night place to eat in EG, this is probably one of the few places that's opened.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove

Not fair having two hands in the same box trying to sort out the pieces that kinda had cheese on them. 1 person only received salad dressing btw.  (I was not able to include pictures, bj's should be ashamed) 1 person ordered a salad instead of fries with her order - was not received.

""Friendly, quick, and complete and accurate order"" is my wife's mini review of our experience tonight, and she's right. Though we usually eat in the restaurants dining room, we may have to use this to-go service on exhausting days, days when BJ's is ridiculously busy (most every day), or just to keep our sanity in a pretty loud restaurant. The next time I dine-in, I'll be sure to capture pics. Overall, the service here has always been stellar, both for to-go and dine-in.

The other night we went and asked to sit in Daniella's  section as she is our favorite server. The host that sat us must have been new because he sat next to her tables but not her section a male server picked us up, again we had no problems with this, a little irritated but nothing to nag on.  However the service we got from him was mediocre, we opened the silverware rolls we got and we have 2 forks but no knives, when we had asked for a knife it was not brought to us we got our drinks and he took our order, we got potstickers and sweet potato fries to begin with. Those took about 10-15 min to come out. The fries were cold, our drinks weren't refilled until our entree's came out so we were sitting with empty cups through out appetizer portion. Onto the entrees, my friend got the BJ's Favorite Pizza and I got the Honey Crisp Chicken Salad.  My friend loved his meal although again slightly cold, my salad had so much lettuce and only about 3 chicken strips, I had asked for no tomatoes or cucumbers but that was on the salad when it came out. The salad in it's self was good, the honey mustard dressing was so good.  When the check came my friend paid with card and I paid in cash. The server ran the card at the table then went to get my cash back from a register, and didn't come back for about 10 min.

Jason J.,"Sacramento, CA",239,143,194,2.0,9/17/2017,"I rarely ever write a bad review but my recent experience at BJ's was awful. It started once me and my family walked in. There were a several people waiting in front for a table, it was safe to assume the hostess was trying to figure out where they were going to accommodate them on the floor since it was a larger party, but all I ask is to be acknowledged. Luckily once everything was sorted out, she was able to take us to a table and apologized for the wait. Once we sat down, our server greets us a few minutes later. He grabs us water while we look through the menu, and everything seems like it's going pretty smoothly. Side note: we arrived at 11 with a movie at 12:10, which is down the street, and we already lurched tickets with assigned seating.  We put in our order a few minutes later and patiently waited. BJ's is notorious for the long wait for food, but I've accepted that and enjoy the food. I was looking looking around and realized that everyone was getting their beverages and food way before us and we sat down and ordered several minutes before. I ordered a Bloody Mary, and probably wouldn't have received it if I didn't remind our server, because I don't think it takes 30 minutes to make a cocktail. I honestly think our server forgot to input our order and it didn't help the situation that he was completely ignoring us. If the kitchen is backed up, or you forgot to put in our order - whatever - let us know what's going on! I've never walked out of a restaurant in my life, but that experience was not acceptable.

Parmesan Crusted Chicken: The first time, the chicken was cooked perfectly and came with a side of their lemon Chardonnay butter sauce to top it off with. The second time, the chicken was burnt and I couldn't even finish it because of the nasty burnt taste. Maybe if they had given me a side of the lemon Chardonnay sauce that it's supposed to come with but had forgotten to give me this time, I could have possibly covered up that nasty taste but it's not likely that it would have helped. Burger: We ordered a different burger both times and they were average. Again, both times the burger tasted burnt even though we requested they be cooked medium well.  Oh well, I didn't really have high expectations so I'm not too disappointed but it is frustrating to pay for overpriced unappetizing food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=20

Shelby C.,"Elk Grove, CA",453,18,33,5.0,11/11/2017,"Before reading my review, I want to give a disclaimer that I have been here so many times I've lost count. I've had both good, bad, and great experiences. Today was a GREAT experience. Today we came here to celebrate Veteran's Day. We were a party of 6 with 3 children (7, 8 & 13), 2 adults (myself and my boyfriend) and a senior (my boyfriends father). Both my boyfriend and his father served for our country, and seeing as though BJ's has had the ""Buy a Hero a Beer"" campaign along with today's Veteran's Day special, I thought it appropriate to bring him here because there is always something good on the menu for everyone. When we came here, I had initially called 1.5 hours before we arrived to put our family on the call ahead list. When we arrived however, we were NOT on the list. I initially got a little flustered and upset, because there was a lot of people waiting and I didn't want to make our family wait a tremendously long time. I showed the hostess my call log on my phone that showed my phone call to the restaurant, and the duration of the call so it shows I was on for a couple minutes. She went ahead and accommodated us and placed us on top of the wait list so that our wait time would cut in half. Fortunately, the wait ended up being even shorter. We were walked to our table and sat properly. The only thing that I should've suggested to the hostess was to try and find a table a little closer to the front so my boyfriends father wouldn't have to walk very far (he has trouble walking far distances or standing for long periods of time). As we were seated, we were greeted within about 30 seconds of sitting down by our server Kristiane J. She has served us before and was very sweet. She took our drink order immediately, and was patient even when myself and a couple of the kids were hesitant in placing our drink order. She came back with all of our drinks, which filled up an entire tray because my boyfriend and I asked for water on top of our beverages. I know how difficult and stressful it can be working in a busy restaurant and making a trip with a heavy tray. She also did great and remembering who got what drink, then kindly took our food order. My boyfriend and I ordered the boneless wing appetizer with the root beer glaze and Nashville hot sauce. Both were AMAZING, and the Nashville ones were AMAZINGLY PERFECT! I seriously love that flavor and so did my boyfriend. They were perfectly battered and filled with a good amount of white meat. I was extremely happy with this dish and look forward to having it again. For our entrees, my boyfriend and his father ordered the Mandarin Orange Porkchops, our oldest ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger, and our 8 year old ordered the kids Mac and cheese with fries. I ordered the sirloin with asparagus and white cheddar mash potatoes. The food took a little while to come out, but not so long that we were getting upset or concerned. Our waitress did an amazing job updating us about the status of our food, and even triple checked when she walked by and noticed nobody and brought us our food yet. The only issue we had was with my sirloin, which I ordered medium-well. When it was first brought out, it was OVER well-done. We could tell immediately before I even cut it open. I was honestly not going to bother sending it back, because I've worked in the restaurant industry before and I know how sending food back can frustrate the flow of the restaurant or the servers and cooks. However, the food runner insisted I ""get what I am paying for"" and kindly took my dish back. When it was brought back out later by Kristiane, it was actually at a medium-rare level, and had to be sent back again. I FELT TERRIBLE and I told her that. She said no, please don't worry. You deserve to get what you paid for. She ran my food back, came back within a few minutes, and the steak was cooked was a good well-done level. I wasn't going to fuss anymore (I was hungry too), so even though I wanted a hint of pink it was still good enough that I could eat it (the first time it came out, the steak was extremely dry).  Kristiane also went out of her way to check for another promotion to honor my boyfriend and his father, in which vets receive a free dessert for having the BJs app on their phone. She also checked on our food regularly, refilled our drinks at the perfect time, and got us boxes so we could take leftovers home. While my son was boxing up his food, he dropped most of his fries on the floor and she insisted to get us some fresh fries to replace the ones he dropped. I was truly happy with her exceptional service, and it made for a great day especially to have a nice day out for Veterans Day with our two vets. I look forward to having her again as our server, and truly recommend Bfs for anyone because there is always something for anyone with their versatile menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=20

BJ's is a great place for a small outing, or for a major festive party. Their menu is fantastic, their root beer is exceptional, and their pizza is pretty much to die for. I love all the regular deep dish options, with the Mediterranean, the spicy pig, the BJ's favorite, in the great White being my favorites. If you like sports, they have several TVs around the restaurant for you to keep up with the latest sports news. BJ's is great for holiday evenings and birthday parties, or a late night chill session with the bros. All in all, I love this place. The waiters and waitresses have always made me feel like I am their most important guest.

Allison L.,"Sacramento, CA",301,282,2340,4.0,2/22/2016,"I eat at BJ's about once every three years and only because other people want to. It's not that I have anything against them, it's just a very crowded, calorie-heavy, and somewhat expensive restaurant. It does offer a wide variety of food, however, so it's good for groups.  I came here on a Saturday night around 6:30 with my boyfriend, his two nephews, his sister, and her husband. When we arrived there was already a crowd of people. There is a parking lot but it was pretty full. The hostess informed me it would be a 45-50 minute wait. I gave her my phone number and she said they'd text me when our table was ready. Luckily it wasn't too cold outside so we sat outside and waited. It ended up being an hour before we were seated. This is pretty normal for BJ's.  We got a corner booth table. Our hostess was pretty friendly and brought out our waters quickly (though the refills later on were slow).  Some of the dishes I tried: Avocado egg rolls: very tasty, but a little too much avocado. You can't eat that many of these.  Potato skins: nice and crispy on the bottom but still soft enough. Lots of bacon!  Chicken Alfredo: kinda strange that it comes with broccoli mixed in, but I guess that makes you feel *healthier.* Generous portion.  Chicken club flatbread: in the appetizer section, but large enough for an entree. Chicken, bacon, tomatoes, aioli, and avocados on a crispy flat bread. A nice change from the thicker, saucey pizzas.  Chocolate chip pizookie: perfectly warm and melty with nice cold ice cream on top! Everything was tasty and the temperature of the food was hot, which was good. The manager actually knew my boyfriend's brother in law, and he went out of his way to make sure we all had a great dining experience.  This is the kinda place where you end up eating and talking for about 2 hours, which is probably why it's always so busy and has a wait time.  Overall, a positive experience. I don't frequent here too often but I would recommend if you have a group of friends or were getting together for a birthday dinner.

Bartender was great, took 2 mins to get to me and got my drink and order taken care with easy. So 5 stars so far.  Food comes out, looks great. Ordered the Rib eyed steak, medium rare, with asparagus and mash potatoes. When I check it to see how well it was cooked, it seemed alittle too rare. I checked the edge, but when I checked the middle it seemed to have only been lightly seared on each side.   So 2.5 stars for that, and mash potatoes were bland.  When I told the bartender about my steak, she quickly had them try to fix it, but you can't really fix Steak that way, but I appreciate the effort. So 3 stars .  The employees from where I was sitting at the edge of the bar were very loud and ranting about customers, I would just recommend they take that to the back or tone it down, I Bartend so I get the frustration but some other customer might now. I probably won't make this my first stop or even top 5 when looking for a good meal in Elk Grove but if you just want mediocre then it works for a quick bite and drink.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=80

First off, we get there and waited like 10 minutes to be seated because they took forever cleaning a table. We sat down and our waitress did not come to us until approximately 10 mins or so. They finally came, we ordered drinks and got it in 5 mins. Then they came and asked if we were ready, we said yes. We ordered everything we wanted but the wait time was superrrrrrrrrrrr long! We waited for almost 45 mins! Our waitress Danielle kept going away for so long and never stopped at our table to relieve us by saying that they are working on our food. My GF ordered an appetizer and it never came until our entrees came. Also the food quality was bad, although the flavor was okay. There were some food that was hard, not steamed long enough, not cooked enough, some were dry as well. My friend never got a side dish that she asked for. The waitress says okay and goes to the back and makes us wait 10 mins and then tells us that there were no more of that side dish.. We didn't feel like complaining and waiting longer for our food so we said no more and ordered dessert. Dessert actually came out in a quick and timely manner, presentation was nice, quality and taste was on point. Of course we didn't tip them.. dreadful.

William L.,"Sacramento, CA",1745,1258,9456,3.0,9/29/2015,"You know, I've been to BJ's at Elk Grove many times for the past 5-6 years, so I got a chance to write this review for now. As a customer dining here at Elk Grove BJ's, I was satisfied for their experiences and honesty for me. I was such an honor for making me a great customer. Located near the Highway 99 entrance at Laguna Blvd, BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse delivers all kinds of food and drinks from specialty entrees (ie. pizzas and signature dishes), finest beer and wine selections, the well known popular dessert Pizookie, and many more. As I entered, the atmosphere is quite large for this lone building, so you can have great dining pleasures here as well as the bartender side too. The concept remains the same as most BJ's restaurants do across the U.S. The employees for this BJ's are doing a great job as I welcome there. The bartenders, hosts, and servers are maintaining the customers very well for recommendations, orders, and the quality of the food or drinks. So far, no cons at all. For the lunch entree, I ordered the Lemon Thyme Chicken which this plate contains one seasoned chicken breast with sauteed vegetables and fresh mild salsa on top over brown rice. As I ate it, it tasted very good! The chicken breast cooked perfectly well and eatable as well as their vegetables and salsa too. Their Lemon Thyme Chicken presentation looked much better than the Arden or Roseville location. Not a bad complete meal at all. Additionally, I also ordered the Chocolate Chip Chunk Pizookie which it's free for purchasing an order of $9.95 or more for today's exclusive offer on 9/29/2015. So far, that Pizookie is incredibly awesome! I can feel the baked chocolate chip cookie dough very smooth and elegant. The two scooped vanilla ice cream on top also tasted good too. What a great Pizookie. There's some good amount of parking available, so you can park anywhere near or far without the hassles. In the end, BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse in Elk Grove is the finest, and nearly better BJ's restaurant that I've ever dined. Perfect for happy hour pleasures and friends/family gathering. My rating: 3 1/2 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=80

Misty T.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",269,141,215,3.0,7/31/2017,"My friends and I decided to go here for dinner on a Thursday. Never had a problem with BJs and I'm actually a fan of the chain. However this location was a mess that night. We got there and there were quite a few people waiting. My friend asked how long the wait would be and they told us 25 minutes. Okay! Cool! No problem. But no. We waited for an hour. Because it was busy, we didn't want to rush them but once we noticed people who got there after us were getting seated, it was time to speak up. So the story goes, someone else took our table who had a ""similar name."" Similar, not the same. They never announced the name and believe me, we were actively listening because we were so hungry and anxious to eat. So Im guessing someone went to the counter and they just assumed. I don't know. After the hostess told us that, they seated us shortly after. We ordered two chicken parmesan chickens and ribs with asparagus -- no appetizers. We waited another 45 minutes for our food to come out. Speaking about just my food, my broccoli was under cooked and my potatoes were cold; only the chicken was warm. After, we ate. We were so done. We've been there for so long and the service was eh. I completely understand the service was eh because it was busy but, I don't think I'll be back any time soon. I hate leaving these type of reviews but it wasn't a great experience.

Amanda S.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",559,133,134,4.0,3/14/2017,"BJ's is the go-to place in Elk Grove to have dinner with family and friends. They are able to host big and small groups perfectly. They are usually busy, so although there's a parking lot, parking can be hard to find. The wait can be long for a big group, but if you have a BJ's premier reward card, you can get priority seating. Their website says: ""As a member of the BJ's Premier Rewards program you will be treated as a special guest every time you dine at BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse. Once you reach 1,000 lifetime points you will have exclusive access to make reservations* at BJs anytime.

My go-to orders are chicken wings (ask for it extra crispy!), chicken bacon ranch pizza and of course, the pizookies! I've tried the new crispy flatbread nachos - and it wasn't worth it. Just get the other flatbreads. The last time I came here, I had excellent customer service from Dylan! He made sure to let us know about the specials for the day (I have never had that from a BJs server) and even let us know about the free pizookie offer that they had going on.

If you have never been to Bj's then its a great place to try or go with a group of people because they have a little bit of everything.  I would say not all the food is great, but they did perfect the pizookis, and I do enjoy their craft beers.  One thing I do not like about this place is they get rid of a lot of stuff on their menu randomly.

Jason B.,"Corona, CA",45,189,162,5.0,10/16/2016,"You may be a fan, or you might not. Really depends what you're looking for. Let me explain.  When I first went to a BJs, I expected something other than what it was. I had already become well entrenched in craft brew snobbery, by countless visits to independent brew pubs and micros. So walking in to BJs I had expectations that were pretty well not met. Initially.  When I go to a place that serves it's own brews, I'm expecting to see giant fermenters, miles of steam pipes, a huge copper boil kettle, a massive mash and lauter tun, all that! I crave the permeating, cloyingly dense sweetness of a fresh malty wort being boiled, and the trip to heaven I get when they dump in the first load of hops and the air becomes pure lupulin magic.  I didn't get that. What I got was a fancy restaurant, built around a brew pub theme, with beers served that apparently they brew elsewhere especially for BJs. So you understand it took me a little while, a couple of beers, and perhaps one corner of a napkin before I got past my preconceptions.  Having done that, and set on a course to enjoy myself in spite of myself, I ordered some food and tried some of their signature brews. The Tatonka Stout is by far my favorite, with many other close seconds. Whatever else you might say, they do serve good beer. Their own, and other micros and Belgians.  Why do they still get 5 stars? Their food. O.M.G. it's freaking amazing. Their pizza is off the chart. Just go try it. You'll not be disappointed.  Not a brew pub! Not a brew pub! Not a brew pub!  But still worth the trip every time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=40

How does a steak lose flavor? I keep trying to find the clever item on the menu but it's just not there for me. Ahi poke? ...nope  ...chicken pita tacos? ...nope! oh wait! greek yogurt ""sauce"" is not tzatziki but just yogurt (how is that a sauce?).

Shayn A.,"Sacramento, CA",33,58,5,5.0,6/18/2017,"I love BJs and especially the one in Elk Grove. We usually go at least once or twice a month. Their rewards program is one of the best around. I always use the preferred wait list via the app. and it is so much less of a wait than what one may usually experience when just walking in. I went to the one at Arden Fair on Thursday and it is not nearly as good as Elk Grove. Food is consistent and always tasty. Menu is extensive with lots of choices. Service can be hit or miss, but last night we had our best server ever at BJs, Stacey! Stacey was fantastic. She was a great combo, she got us everything we needed, was attentive,  made conversation (but not too much conversation), and always anticipated our needs. She was like one of the family!

Your host stated she can put me on the list, but I need to download your app and preorder. I explained to her we were a dental office and on our 1 hour lunch break but also celebrating my bday. I enjoy the menu at BJs and wanted a fun lunch experience since it was my choice to pick a place. I downloaded the app, had an awful time getting my coworkers salad order in, took 3 different try's and she had to pick a different item since none of the 3 salad choices were avail. My order was in by 11:55, and our dine in time was for 12:15. Part of my party arrived, they were seated and given menus, after our office Mgr tried to explain we already preordered and asked if the food was ready for 12:15. The host was confused and didn't know what was going on. I arrived a couple minutes after when Dennis the waiter comes to get our drink order. My office Mgr said, its Shirley's bday today. He didn't make any eye contact or acknowledge what she said. He continued to ask for drink orders. I leaned over and showed him my phone with the order detail and asked if the order was fine, he waived a piece of paper and said I have this. Never looked at me or answered my question, he was so rude and impolite. We did not see him until 12:44 when our food and to go boxes were set down on our table. He left and came back in 5 min to give us our tab. Nobody at our table had any time to eat our meals, nor were we asked if we wanted anything else, no acknowledgement that it was my bday, we were rushed, and honestly it was the worst experience by a BJs restaurant and their employees! It was awful!! I left there apologizing to my Drs, the ofc manager and the rest of my coworker for the behavior that your restaurant delivered.

He was running around trying make sure everyone was taken care of but was struggling. I appreciate his service during my time here at Bjs.  I'm giving the store a 2/5 because there was no manager to help him out. There was no one to clear out the table for dessert. No one was helping him make the experience better. I don't blame my server for the poor experience I blame the manager for not helping him out. The poor service reflect the manager on duty.

Tina H.,"Elk Grove, CA",121,24,3,3.0,12/29/2016,"My coworkers and I always come here to grab a bite after our shift, so I know the menu really well. I just wished they had more pasta options! I really miss the cajun pasta they had a while back. I decided to take my family here for dinner around 6:30pm on a Thursday night and it was jam packed. I was told by the hostess that the wait would be around 30~40 minutes and that I would get a text when the table for 4 would be ready. 25 minutes pass and our table is ready. My family and I got Samuel as our server. He was great, it took him a while to get our drinks, but I totally understand since it was pretty busy. He checked on us several times throughout our meal and was overall a patient server, just a little forgetful (we didn't get a to-go bag and had to ask for water refills).  My family and I ordered a variety of items on the menu. For the appetizer we got the boneless chicken wings with sriracha dry rub and crispy flatbread nachos. I found the boneless chicken wings to be like a better version of chicken nuggets, but more crispy and a little bit on the salty side. The crispy flatbread nachos were amazingly good for something that didn't have meat at all! For the entrees, we got the clam chowder bread bowl w/ a side of caesar salad, fresh atlantic salmon, new orleans jambalaya, and the parmesan crusted chicken. The clam chowder bread bowl that my little sister ordered had less soup than we anticipated, it was mostly sourdough bread. My mom liked the fresh atlantic salmon and my dad enjoyed the new orleans jambalaya because of the dish's spices. I thought the jambalaya would be more on the soupy/saucy side, but it still tasted good. The entree that I did not enjoy was the parmesan crusted chicken. The chicken was not crusty enough, was kind of on the dry side, and just lacked flavor, so the price of $16.50 for that dish was steep, however the mashed potatoes that came with it was so good though! Every time I go to BJ's, whether it's with friends, coworkers, or family, the food is decent and the portions are pretty big. The service is average. Overall, I always enjoy coming here to eat and catch up with friends. And when I drink, I get the strawberry splash because it tastes like jamba juice with alcohol :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=100

Upon arrival, there was a lack of hosts at the front. It took a decent amount of time for us to get seated. You could easily tell that they were short staffed. Once seated, we had some time to look over the menu. I was starving so everything looked good, neither of us could decide what we wanted for our entrees, so we just decided to start off with an appetizer. The appetizer arrived, and we were ready to order, however our server was nowhere to be found. I'm a very understanding person, however 30 minutes passed and there was absolutely no sight of her. It took my angry mother to walk around the whole establishment to finally find her, which I find absolutely ridiculous. At that point, we didn't even want to eat there anymore. We didn't want to have to wait another additional 20+ minutes for our food to arrive. The server apologized and the manager came out to tell us that she's comping our appetizer. Funny story though, I saw the manager come out 15 minutes prior to apologize to another customer for something else.

I will say this the first time the manager on duty was nice enough to to send me a $15 gift card but my friend who's order was also messed up never heard back. They had the wrong ice cream flavor and her mushrooms were un-edible because she asked for one main ingredient to be removed. Another confusion is I ordered curbside pick up a different day, but where the heck do you go for the curbside pick up, good thing I went in so they again didn't give me what I ordered and had to wait.

To the lady who complained that you got there before us and we were seated first...umm try the waitlist and maybe you'll get seated faster.  Food is ok, in my opinion. I ordered the french dip in which the bread was burnt. My little kids got the kids cheeseburger meals and the the meat was enough for just one bite. What the heck was that about? Hubby and my oldest daughter ordered a sirloin and they were happy with their meals- aside from getting an empty bottle of A1 sauce :/  And all our fries were cold and hard.  Anyway, they were busier than normal tonight. I don't think they were prepared for the families coming for the fundraiser. I overheard a server tell a customer that they didn't know why they were busier than normal. Communication between managers and staff maybe lacking? Who knows! All I know is that it was a long wait for our server to come to the table to introduce herself, a long wait for our drinks and appetizers, a longer wait for our food. When our food finally arrived, they forgot our ranch and we got an empty bottle of A1 sauce.  I get they were busy and maybe over whelmed, and normally service is better that's why the 4 stars.

Dina C.,"Elk Grove, CA",31,3,,1.0,6/20/2017,"So tonight my family and I went to BJ's to celebrate our 20th anniversary did not want to travel too far for another restaurant so chose something what we thought to be nice in our area. When we got there the greeting hostess was very nice. However the hostess that was assisting in seating had a look on her face like she hated her job. The actual hostess that sat us assisted in cleaning the table so that we can be seated and she was very kind. Our waitress then came over and took our drink order and she to was kind. We placed our order with a couple appetizers and then our entrées and proceeded to wait as you would expect for the appetizers to arrive. The restaurant seemed to be understaffed as it took so long for us to get our appetizers to arrive and when they arrived at the table were lukewarm at best, as if they were left in the kitchen for some time. We then realized we did not have utensils or napkins or even appetizer plates and we had to ask for that as well. Upon inspection of the silverware we noticed spotting and food particles left on some of the utensils. When our meals arrived my sons plate which was hot wings should have been hot from the heat and not from the sauce but they two were lukewarm at best the fries that accompanied his dish again barely hot. The chicken on my salad as well as the shrimp on my husbands were also under temperature. We did not complain only because it was so late and felt that a complaint would only delay our meal that much longer.  I would not suggest returning to this place and I'm very surprised of the number of people who are constantly waiting to get in. Although the price is not astronomical it is a little higher than your average restaurant and you would hope that you get what you pay for and clearly on this visit we did not.

I have had alittle bit of everything here and I've concluded that nothing is overall that great. If you want a drink stick with the beers or wine.

My husband and I both ordered the rib eye because the menu had so much going on that we figured they didn't do anything well and let's face it how can you screw up a ribeye. Especially one they felt they could charge 27.00 for. Well let me tell you, they did it. My husband's came first with the rest of the tables meals, myself and one other person in the party waited a full 15 minutes before our plates were delivered, which of course made everyone else's food cold because we are civilized and wait for everyone to be served before we eat. Back to the steak. It was ordered medium rare (both were) it came and it just looked dry. Not the kind of seared so it's juicy inside dry, but shoe leather dry (at this point I look at the ""loaded"" baked potato that consists of a slot with some cheese, sour cream and bacon bits shoved in it, it wasn't even cracked open just slit) he cut into it and it was this wierd dayglow red. But when you touched it it felt like a well done steak. It chewed like a well done steak, so the only thing that we can figure is that they must add some sort of food colouring to the meat. Mine was no better except the colour was a little more natural. We didn't eat 3 bites of it. The server never asked how it was and seeing how this was not our birthday celebration we didn't want to make a scene. However after shelling out what amounted to about 80.00 after tip for a meal we couldn't eat I thought maybe we should warn people off.  Seriously, maybe this place does something well but it ain't the meat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=140

Food was as expected and service was good.  After our server brought our check, we were pretty much left on our own. The check came quickly after the dessert came out. We put our card in and continued to finish dessert. After maybe 15 mins or so, the waitress hadn't come back to pick up the card to run it. We decide to wait a little longer and keep chatting. Another 10 or so mins past and still no waitress. The restaurant had gotten busier, but to not come back within almost half an hour is a long time!

He takes the bill and card to the back and comes back to tell us only the server can run it, so he gave it to her.  Another few mins waiting at the front, we haven't gotten our card or receipt back. I see a guy, who looks like he can be the manager and asked him for help. He too was running around that I had to come back to him again and remind him we were still waiting for our card. Finally we were able to get our card back and sign.  It was such a long time waiting and such a hassle to get our card charged. Everything was good until the restaurant got busy and it seemed like everyone, including the manager, was too busy to help.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=140

Khan L.,"The Pocket-Greenhaven, Sacramento, CA",72,5,,1.0,6/28/2016,"Let me start of with saying that this rating is due to the horrible server (Chandra A #191) that we had. Food is consistent with all other bj's. I do not wish her to get fired but she defiantly needs to be retrained.  Came here yesterday for dinner with 3 other friends and I would say it was a normal day. They had a good number of tables filled, but being super busy was defiantly not what had cause these errors to occur.          First she stopped by our table and asked for our drink orders.  While one friend was still decided on her drink, she just walked away without saying a word. And when she did come back and my friend had ordered an alcoholic drink, the server did not even card her. Which we didn't really care as my friend is 27, but she was definitely not doing her job.  After we had placed our order and the food came, she never returned to check on table. We had to ask other servers for assistance. Which they were glad to help but it was not their job to serve our table.  When she final came to ""check"" on us, she had the bill and asked if we would like anything else. We had ordered a pizookie at the beginning with our meal. When we reminded her of this, she just said ""oh yeah."" Also at this point we had ask her for two to go containers and one soup container.  She then came back with the two to go containers, and the bill before our pizookie even got to our table. We also reminded her of the soup container which she stated with an attitude that she's getting it.  We had 2 gift cards and asked to split the rest onto 2 credit cards. Which should be roughly around $20 each. She then returns and states that the machine ran most of the bill ($45) on my card and the machine was not taking my friend's card. Asking my friend if she had another card. At this point it was only $5 so I just asked her to charge it all to my card, which was not a big deal. My friend then went online to reviewed her card history and the card that was ""declined"" had already been charged. It was the one that had been charged the $45, which her bank probably froze the second time she tried to swipe it for an additional amount.  And if she had split the bill like we had asked, we don't understand how a $45 bill would have been charged. It would have been $20, and the other $20 was declined.  When she finally came back after charging our cards, we confirmed that my friends card was charged the $45 and mine was charged $5 (our names and last four of the card numbers are on the receipts, which she could also had seen to realized that she had charged the same card that she stated was declined) Also at this point we still did not get the soup container, which we asked for again. When we saw a few minutes later that she was assisting a different table we asked a different  server who got it right away for us. She never came to apologize or I don't even think she remembered/cared that she forgot it AGAIN. When she finally came with the pizookie and I was in the middle of packing my meal. She then picked up one plate from our table and proceeded to grab my plate from my hand (when I was still packing) when my friend had her empty plate right in front of me.  And as we were sitting there finishing our pizookie and chatting she came back to grab the bill from under my hand and just walked away. I would think the proper thing to do would be to ask for it. But I guess not for her.  Her rude attitude definitely ruined our night and made us regret going there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=140

By then our coffee cooled off and again I had to ask another employee where is our server?  There was a noticeable buzz kill with the atmosphere infected by the lack of service. I felt embarrassed as their host to bring them here. I'm usually a good tipper, but it goes both ways. I left a dollar.  A few months ago I was here with a local friend. We sat at the bar on a Saturday for lunch. I completely finished my meal by the time he received his order. It was no fun eating alone. Management offered a tepid sorry, but no comp.

Very cool for kitchen efficiency, but results in poor customer experience because depending on order flow in the kitchen you can, and I've experienced, receiving the main course before the appetizer.

I felt the service on the day we went was spot on. Our waitress was very attentive and kept checking on us throughout the meal.  Food was pretty good for a chain restaurant. My hubs is really into the little greek tacos they offer. I tried the cold quinoa salad and it was delicious! I'd eat that by itself.  I ordered the fish and chips. The fish was nicely cooked and the breading was good. I didn't like the tarter sauce, it had thick cut pickles or something, super overpowering. Get the thick cut fries and a side of honey mustard, yum! There's a sweet and salty kind of vibe going on.   We passed on dessert and all that jazz. The servings are big enough for 14 people so I had tons of leftovers. I left the fish and took the fries. Pro tip: reheat them in the oven at 425F, or under the broiler if you dare!  Thanks for giving back to our Veterans BJ's Brewhouse. It was really fun to see all the cars in the parking lot with the different service branches on them.

He took at least 20 minutes to help this guy out, huddled with his manager and two other employees talking and laughing on this one computer screen, like the intro to the old scooby-doo where there reading that book. (keep in mind there was two computers). Totally unprofessional, and you can get better service at the Mcdonalds across the road for 1/3 the price. I was not aknolwedged that i would be helped out (even if it would take longer). i wasn't even looked at!  Finally, the guy leaves and I get to Nick. He gives me a sigh and a tired, ""hello... name"". Like im inconviencing him by being there. At this point I just wanted to get this food and leave. I tell him my name is John, and I give him my gift card and a ""VIP"" card to take 20% off. And for some reason Nick wasn't trained on how to swipe a card into the machine, and has me wait around 10 more minutes so he can grab his manager again and work this ""VIP"" card. They need to fire this guy or train him on how to be an appropriate server, because it seriously needs work ASAP.

The burger had no cheese and a lot of lettuce, pickels and tomatoes. The fries were wedge, weren't all the way cooked. My boyfriend order the pasta Parmesan chicken and the chicken wasn't cooked so he just ate the pasta. The Egroll appetizers were super soft. Not crunchy like a egg roll at all like we have experienced in the past. I was up all night my stomach hurt so bad from eating barley have that burger, It was bad meat.

She said she can't refund me because I had no proof and they had no record of my transaction. Finally she ended up giving me $45 in a bj gift card. I didn't want that. I just wanted my money back. I got sick from it and threw it away. Don't ever order to go here. They seriously don't give a care at all about to go orders.

I go here with my coworkers for lunch (at the Folsom location) and I usually order the unlimited soup and salad: Wedge salad and Tortilla Soup. Mmmm! Now dinner for me has been hit and miss at the Elk Grove location. I would like to start with saying...I miss the pot roast!  Whhhhyyy did they take it away?! I've ordered calamari on two different occasions both times it was bland. I added salt and pepper and it was tons better! The order came out fast, but the batter wasn't cooked all the way. Whompwhomp. Same thing with the pizza. Maybe it was a rough night in the kitchen...? I've ordered the Black and Bleu burger, cooked to perfection! The seasoned shoestring fries, not so much. It was lacking seasoning and the fries weren't crispy.  I'm not a fan of inconsistency, but I keep going back expecting it to be the awesome food from my memory. Maybe it's new management?

Patrick S.,"Seattle, WA",83,55,101,4.0,2/20/2015,"I come here occasionally. I have a love-hate relationship with BJ's, but mainly love. I always get avacado egg rolls and they never disappoint when you're dining in. Decided to try their curbside service this time. The avacado rolls were slightly soggy but still delicious nonetheless. First time trying the carne fries, they were surprising tasty but probably wouldn't order again.  As for other appetizers the spinach artichoke dip is one to try. I've had their broccoli cheddar soup twice, but the second time around the taste was slightly off. On another note I tend to try all their chicken dishes, I suggest the southwestern chicken (I hope that's what it was called). And it's a must to get a pizookie, any flavor will do... They're all mouthwatering! Plus you get a free mini on your birthday! As for servers, great customer service. There has never been a meal where I was dissatisfied with the staff.

I decided to go 15 minutes later than the time promised just to give them more time since it was a Saturday. When I arrived, my order was still not ready, and the employee did not even have the courtesy to apologize for the inconvenience. In fact she had an attitude the whole time she processed my transaction. While my promised time was 7:45, I arrived at 8am, I had to still wait for my order for another 30 minutes. After  30 minutes of waiting I decided to go talk to a manager, and explained him the situation. The manager instead of apologizing for proving the worst service ever, had the decency to ask me for my email address so that he can email me a coupon. Like honestly dude, you think we are that desperate for a cheap coupon or free food. I turned him down and just asked him to give the food I ordered. The manager himself does not seem to live up to customer service, ethics, and professionalism, so how can we expect him to manage his employees. While I had originally given BJ's a full 5 star; however, majority of the  reason I give restaurants receive 5 star is mainly because of their service. Well, today BJ's did not match up to its service, it was the worst most terrible service I'd received; therefore, I am giving this place a 1 star just for their food, but a zero star for service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=220

We hit this place up after Arena Cross this last weekend and Joanna was our waitress. She was great! She was attentive and gave great beer recommendations!

Sonia S.,"Walnut Creek, CA",59,1,,1.0,9/30/2017,"If I could give a negative 5 for a review I definitely would. We came here for my graduation and after waiting 25 minutes my name was called for our table of 7. When I went to the host (Ashley) for my seat I was asked to wait another 5-10 minutes as they didn't have the menus /utensils ready. I waited and once my name was called again I was seated at a roomy, booth in the back near the mirrors. After my remaining party arrived we were asked by the waitress (Lindsay) if there was any way we could relocate to another booth as there was a person who had a reservation and it was their birthday and they sat at this particular booth every year. Out of kindness we were ok to move and Lindsay told us our appetizers and bazookies would be free for the inconvenience. It turned out to be a falsification that a party requested that booth for their birthday; this was said in order to get us to move because of an error made by the host (Ashley) of incorrectly seating us. On the way over to the other booth, my friend slipped and fell on the floor onto her back and hit her head on the floor. The wax on the restaurant floor was uneven and even those of us wearing flat shoes felt the floor was slippery. All the diners around were absolutely shocked yet no one came to even help. Not a single waitress came for at least 2-5 minutes (this is all on camera). We were told a manager (Morgan) would come by to take care of us. Morgan's attire matched that of the other waiters so we had no idea that she was a manager when she came to check on my friend. Morgan offered an ambulance, initially my friend declined because she wanted to try to sit down and see if she felt better. Immediately, Morgan came out with an incident report (we find out later that someone falls almost everyday at BJs), which probably explains the speediness of the incident report delivery. After about 15-20 minutes an ambulance was called to check on my friend because she felt dizzy and was in pain. The ambulance said the charges wouldn't be covered and that cost would need to be worked out with the restaurant. Another manager (Stuart) had came out to check on us and told us the cost of the ambulance would be covered. Mind you, we have another waitress (Kalani) by this time. Kalani asked us in an angry tone why we had called the manger over to our table and it had nothing to do with her, she wasn't aware of the fall as she was just handed our party as one of her tables to serve. Our new booth was crowded, in the dark and near the entrance and we deeply regretted agreeing to move tables. Once we told Kalani that our friend had fallen, she informed us that the waiters wear non slip shoes. When the ambulance arrived, the paramedic even commented that the floors are slippery. Kalani tried to serve us food while the ambulance was present and we asked For her to take it back as we are dealing with the paramedics. Once we rejected the food, Kalani gave our party a really dirty look and walked away with a really unprofessional attitude. Stuart (manager #2) came by again but argued that he was doing all that he could to take care of us and we expressed otherwise. Stuart himself told us that people slip and fall all the time here and I asked him how that was okay or acceptable and ""what if it was an old person - they would have probably fractured a bone."" Stuart also refused to pay for the few drinks we ordered  because he stated CA laws prohibited him from covering the cost of the drinks. We all wanted to split the bill and he said ""what a mess!"" and I spoke up. I told him that none of this was our fault , it was their fault for the unevenly waxed floors, and instead of making us feel like a burden, it's the company's responsibility to keep paying customers happy whether it's 1 card or 5 cards that we pay with. I also told him that his team lacks communication and synchronization as the host's mistake lead to the shifting of tables. We had to ask him for our vouchers for the bazookies and as he walked away he made a comment under his breath of ""Oh, God!"" This was an absolute disaster and the poorest, most uncoordinated customer service I've ever experienced at BJs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=220

Very well priced and this goes great with their hefeweizen. This place is well organized, speedy with their food and really good customer service.

BJ's does tend to garner a wait on evenings, especially during the weekend, but you must remember that it's only places in Elk Grove open past 10! The menu has something for just about everyone, it's spacious, and there's a bar, so why wouldn't it be popular? Anyway, the service is always friendly and attentive for the most part--it can get very busy & a water glass may go unfilled for a while, but alas. The food is tasty. I like the turkey club with those crispy thin-cut fries. The gluten-free pizza is really bomb--you don't need to be GF to enjoy it. My favorite item is the bone-in chicken on the appetizer menu & I sometimes order it as a meal. The only miss has really been the baked pasta, which was on the salty side. Pizookies are always good, though I'm still annoyed the company did away with the apple crisp one. I like the salted caramel, though.

Nancy G.,"Sacramento, CA",0,3,,3.0,5/26/2017,"Let me start by saying thanks to the manager, I believe his name is Sammy,  it turned out to be a better night then how it started. My family decides to celebrate our stepdad's birthday there tonight. We get there at 6pm with a party of 18. Of course we knew it would be a wait, we were told 90 minutes. So after 2 hours we ask how much longer do we have to wait the hostess tells us there's 3 parties ahead of us so maybe another 15 min. AFTER those 15min we ask again and she tells us we still have to wait, she has no room for us yet, and doesn't know how long it will take. So we ask to speak to the manager. He tells us to ""give him a few minutes he was going to sort things out for us, we had waited too long already""... He sits us in less than 10 min!!! The server was so attentive and did his best to keep up with so many of us. He took our orders right away and made sure our drinks were refilled. By the way manager even brought the kids appetizers so they wouldn't be waiting too long for food. The food didn't disappoint, I had the chicken Alfredo pasta and it was delicious. I love the raspberry lemonade.  If It wasn't for the very long wait and hostess giving us the run around I would have have them 5 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=320

That made the experience pleasant because it was after the gym and we were famished. Service was acceptable, not great and over the top and not tacky either.  TIP: don't come here on the weekend if you are hungry. You will wait like a starving slave till you see your bones protrude through you chubby flesh. Come any day before Friday and after Sunday.

Avocado egg rolls, california club sandwich, thin cut fries, hawaiian mahi mahi, you just can't go wrong! It's a fun place for birthdays too, just make a reservation whenever possible. And on top of that, the pizookies are the best. They introduce new flavors every so often but every flavor I've tried is so good. I like the pizookie trio because you can pick 3 flavors if you can't decide.

We started with the avocado eggroll appetizer. Cooking the avocado really brings out the nutty flavor of the avocado. The dipping sauce was a little too sweet for me. I had a dinner salad, nothing special. For dinner I ordered the deep dish BJ's Special Combo Pizza. It was excellent. The dough was light and airy like puff pastry, a pleasant surprise, not what I was expecting. The toppings were not oily or greasy and the red sauce was tangy. For desert we shared a S'mores Peanut Butter and Ice Cream dish. There's no way one person could eat that, and I'm still buzzen from the sugar rush.

Kristen B.,"Elk Grove, CA",143,106,50,3.0,5/28/2015,"I recently went here with my family to have an early birthday celebration for both my parents, since all my sisters were back home, which is very rare nowadays. When we walked in, the parking lot seemed fuller than the inside of the place. We were seated right away at a booth directly across the big screen, showing the Warriors game. Fasho! Even though we already knew they lost, it was nice to watch the game too. I don't remember our waitress's name, but if I had to guess, I think it was Norma. Anyway, ""Norma"" was SUPER nice and just how people in the retail/customer service/restaurant business should be! She took our orders, and my family and I just chatted amongst ourselves and watched the game til our food came. I ordered the bison burger. Since my previous experience with bison burger, at another restaurant, was a big fail, I had to see if it really was a big fail, or it was just because of the situation. Since the bison burger was in the lighter menu, the portion isn't as big as your typical burger. It also had a side of colesaw. The burger wasn't too bad. It didn't amaze me though. The colesaw, same. It didn't amaze me. However, my dish DID fill me up halfway through. If you have a small appetite, I suggest you order from the light menu. It's cheap and portions are just enough to fill you. The downside to our meal was that my sister ordered the pork chop from the light menu as well, and it came with diced potatoes. One of the potatoes was still frozen in the middle. We didn't tell ""Norma"" because it was just ONE potato, but this is just an fyi. Check to make sure your food is thoroughly cooked before digging in. Other than that, everyone enjoyed their food. My other sister, mom, and dad ordered salads, but suckers are HUGE! Kinda wished I got a salad instead. I wish I had room for a pizookie because those things are BOMB.COM! I think I saw that they do 3 mini pizookies for some set price. I think I would do that one day :) Overall, food was just eh, but our waitress, ""Norma"", was excellent! Friendly, patient, and super nice!

After she took our order, our food didn't come until 30 to 45 minutes later, but our food came out lukewarm to cold. We didn't complain about it because if we had to wait that long for our food to come out, we wouldn't be out of that restaurant until 4 or 5PM.  A different server gave us our bill and we quickly sorted our money. And again, our waitress did not come until 20 minutes later.  Our food would have been amazing if it was served to us right when it was done being made. Our service was just terrible. I am honestly really disappointed on how they were functioning that day.

When we were done, he came to the table and asked my stepson if he wanted a pizookie. For free!! I just could not believe it. Our day was made.

I've been to other BJ's locations but none of them have been as consistent as BJ's of Elk Grove in regards to quality of service and food. I'm not sure of whether BJ's reheats premade entrees or not. But whatever they're doing here, they're doing it right to set themselves apart from other BJ's locations.

Amber W.,"Sacramento, CA",118,16,14,1.0,4/13/2017,"This was the worst experience I have ever had at Bj's, and I am a faithful customer.  On 4/11/17 I made a reservation for lunch at 11:30 for 15 people for 4/12. When we arrived, there was no reservation. The young hostess who told us there was no reservation was not very helpful and almost rude. We let her know that we were in a hurry and had to get back to the office, yet she showed no sense of urgency to get us seated. When we were finally seated, we were put into an area that had no hostess. Another 20 minutes passed and I ended up flagging someone down to find out who are waiter/waitress is because at this point we still have not even been served water. After another few minutes a waitress named Selia shows up to our table  and apologizes to us saying she just started her shift and doesn't know why the hostess sat us in a section where there was nobody to help us. We explained to her that we had already been waiting for almost 50 minutes and were in a hurry. She was professional and took our order quickly, making sure our food was a priority in the kitchen. The free dessert they offered us at the end of our lunch did not hardly make up for the horrible service we all experienced.

The food got here quick. My friend and I we both got burgers. He got a double burger and I had got a bacon burger. When the food came out the presentation was beautiful. I didn't request for my Burger to be medium but it came out pretty rare. That was probably the only negatives when it came to the food. Later on in the evening there was a really big group of people who showed up and when I start asking the waitress for more barbecue sauce she forgot once or twice probably because she was pretty busy. I don't want to hold it against her because I also work in the food industry so I understand. She told us that if we signed up for rewards then we get Free mini pazooki.  I ordered the Oreo brownie Pazooki and my friend ordered the triple chocolate pazooki.

Daniel H.,"Sunnyvale, CA",26,83,,1.0,8/23/2015,"Let's start with the pro's...  The food was good and the price was great.  The reason I give this 1 star is because of what we experienced at the restaurant.  The waitress was actually very awesome and very nice and sweet to my kids.  It really pisses me off of the experience we witnessed.  But let me start at the beginning.....      I was born and raised in the Bay Area but my family and I live in Austin Texas.  We came to Elk Grove searching for homes as we are planning on moving there.  We went to see a realtor in Elk Grove and afterwords decided to try BJ's.  There is a BJ's in Austin TX, but never really had an inkling to go into it for some reason as we associate it with alcohol more often then a food establishment.  Don't get me wrong, we like some liquor every once and a while but never thought of it as a place to want to drink or eat.  The BJ's in Elk Grove was right across the street from the realtor, so we decided to give it a shot.      I ordered some Clam Chowder, which was excellent BTW, and my wife ordered a specialized salad which was also great.  We were greeted with a friendly waitress that immediately took care of us.  The problem started as we were waiting for our meals.  Not less then 10 feet away, a guy, who I guess was her manager, pulled her aside and started yelling at her in front of everyone.  The place was pretty full of people and I could clearly say that over 5 groups of people eating there heard this scene.  As both my wife and myself have been in customer service pretty much our entire lives as well as my degree is in Organizational Psychology, I was seriously appalled by what I witnessed.  I mean the manager yelled at her so loud that she almost started crying right on the floor, and both my wife and myself were just stunned and very uncomfortable about what we had just witnessed.  As a managers performance, that was probably one of the most unprofessional things anyone could do to anyone under their employment, and not just the employee, but themselves, as they speak and act on behalf of the company.   I do not know what the waitress could have done to have been treated so unprofessionally by the manager but we asked to speak to the manager he never came.  Either way, we have every piece of data that they would need to find out when it happened, but I seriously doubt they even read these nor care about that experience after what we had experienced on how they treat their employees. No food is worth of having to watch that type of disrespect for their employees and customers.  The manager should have taken her off the floor and spoke to her, not yell at her, period.  If need be write it up, whatever the case may be, but belittling, yelling, and disciplining an employee in front of customers is just wrong.  I sure as hell won't support any type of business that feels that this is a good way to treat employees.  The employee was so embarrassed, that she could not even look at us in the face anymore.  I don't blame her.        I really do not know who trained this manager at his job, but he is just not manager material.  He is either a bully that gets off on treating his employees like dirt, or just a very poor excuse for a supervisor.  If this company allows this type of behavior, I cannot see how they are still in business.   Sorry, I tried to remain semi-professional in this post, but even days after the fact, which is what I do before I post on here, I am still steaming about this experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=360

Trevor A.,"Sacramento, CA",100,122,13,3.0,10/14/2013,"Went for a late lunch Saturday afternoon around 3 pm.  PLENTY of bar area seating and not  long wait for tables.  We chose the bar area to watch some football & get ""quicker service"".  Apparently it was basically shift change time.  The waiter that started serving us was clearly on his way out the door. It took him 10 minutes get to us for drink orders.  And rather than get me what I wanted he pimped the house brews instead.  So I ask for samples of two specific ales.  He brings those after another 5 minutes and 2 more neither of us asked for.  Luckily this wasn't added to the check.  After we ordered our food the slow waiter vanished for he day for a much more lively and attentive server. The beers themselves served their purpose.  I had a black & tan like concoction that was with an IPA that I found too citrusy on its own and the delicious stout.  Black & tan like because it was clearly not poured over a spoon.  At this point it had been nearly 20 minutes since sitting down so I didn't get too particular about that.  My date for the evening had a wonderful porter with some raspberry soda or juice added.  Normally not my thing but I almost ordered one to go with dessert. For whatever reason I remembered their burger selection being MUCH better than what it was.  Every one of them had mayo and thousand island style sauce.  No biggie.  They gladly removed them both.  Another buck fifty for cheese and bacon.  The Swiss cheese was wonderful.  The two strips of bacon were like baseball glove laces.  Thin and chewy.  Not so great.  Burger itself was cooked to order and plenty juicy.  Saved the entire meal.  Because the cheap iceberg lettuce with it did not.  The regular fries are the dreaded shoestrings.  The seasoned fries are steak cut and MUCH tastier. The chocolate chip pizookie left us leaving happy enough to not write the place off forever.  Total check for the two beers, two burgers and pizookie was $42.  $50 after tipping the waiter that showed up off the bench. Definitely NOT waiting more than 15 minutes for a table here ever again though.  Insanity.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=360

Karen G.,"San Jose, CA",142,276,184,3.0,1/2/2013,"I love BJs, so it makes me sad that during the one hour I was here, FOUR different families (including ours) had a complaint for the manager. I can't even imagine how many they got throughout the day.  The hostess was MIA for a long time when we walked in. I saw a family leave after they had been waiting to put their name in for a table. We were then seated at a table by the grumpiest hostess ever but my mom had asked for a booth and told her so. There was an empty booth that was available but needed to be cleaned. The hostess sighed loudly and said ""ok but it will be a wait because I don't know when they'll clean up. You need to go wait at the front"". Um rude much?? So I said, ""yes we know we need to wait at the front, thanks "". Do you think she asked for anyone to come clean the table after we had already waited for 20 min? Nope.  My dad ended up asking for the manager, while my mom was ready to leave (btw, this was technically a low key anniversary dinner for them. Not a good start). The manager quickly apologized and cleaned the table himself. After the rude welcome, we had a great time. The food was good and our server was quick and attentive. If you've never been here, you HAVE to try the avocado rolls as an appetizer. I also ordered the tomato bisque, the stuffed mushrooms with artichokes, spinach and feta, and the tomato with mozzarella salad. While I thought that the salad was very good, I found it a bit strange that it was topped with Parmesan cheese. Regardless, in my case, the more cheese the better!  Note for management: I wish I had gotten the name of the young girl at the front, but if you know who was working on Tuesday, January 1st around 2:30 - 3:30 pm, she needs an attitude adjustment. Our bill came to over $130 and our money would have gone elsewhere had my dad not spoken to the manager who quickly helped us. I am sure you can understand how it feels to walk into a restaurant expecting a great time and be greeted (actually, she barely said two words to us) by a sour-faced person who exudes ""I hate my job"". Does not feel good. I observed her with other guests, and I even heard someone next to our table say, ""what's her problem??""

THEN I get back to work. My flat bread was COLD, the salad dressing was wrong for my salad, and I got the wrong piadino( ordered caprese but received chicken bacon ranch). The only good thing was the fries which are pretty hard to mess up... I order to go from the BJs at least once a week and it usually is not an experience like this!

Monica C.,"Sacramento, CA",1247,451,5677,1.0,3/3/2015,"I usually have an "" ok"" experience when I'm here with friends for HH or for a dinner party. ""Ok"" because I'm usually too distracted by conversations and alcohol to pay attention to the service and food. It's another story when I'm not with friends and when I'm actually not drinking. My experience lastnight is a perfect example . I woke up from a nap feeling hungry and sick . We all know that when a girl is hungry and not feeling well, you shouldn't do anything to piss her off. Well, I decided to do what mr. Stoppelman did but instead of searching for a dr, I actually was looking for a place open for some soup . While Mr. Stoppelman came across the fabulous idea of yelp out of his curiosity, I came across Bj's brewhouse using yelp :) They were open and I thought clam chowder and a baked potatoe sounded like a great idea. I then call to be placed on hold for 15 minutes . I think that's the longest I'd ever been put on hold and I was already annoyed . To make matters worse, I come in to pick up my food and get ignored ! Clearly there were employees standing there not doing their job but instead talking up a storm with each other. So, I had to wait 20 minutes to finally get some help which was another annoyance . Last and final annoyance ? I come home and notice my potato looking ugly with dried vegetables on them . If you look on the menu, it says it comes with Alfredo sauce on top but it didn't even have any, leaving my potato and its dry vegetable toppings even more dry . Did you think I was done complaining ? cause I'm not lol after eating my soup, I almost swallowed a piece of plastic that was cooked in my soup . Thanks Bj's! I will most definitely not be returning .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=300
R Y.,"Elk Grove, CA",5,67,,1.0,2/27/2015,"Made a reservation for eleven people on Wednesday for a Friday night gathering. On Friday I called again to add another person and was told I didn't have a reservation. My original reservation was for five PM and I was told that the earliest I could get in now was 9 PM because they couldn't find me! What the heck! I escalated to the manager and he said that we would be squeezed in at our original 5 PM time but that we would be have to leave after two hours. My answer was that we wouldn't hang around as long as our order was taken and delivered in a timely manner. We all showed up at 5 PM, were seated almost immediately, then everything went to heck again. A couple of my group had special orders due to allergies and their food came out wrong! So, even though we hate sending things back, we did. It took quite awhile for. Their food to come back out. But, it was finally made correctly. Three in our group ordered dessert, two provokes and a small vanilla ice cream. They brought the check with the desserts added, but we hadn't gotten our desserts yet. We paid the bill, assuming that our dessert was on the way. Boy, were we wrong, it took two reminders to our waiter that we had yet to get our dessert. We ended up being there for nearly THREE HOURS!

I got my usual clam chowder, which I'm in love with because everything else here is bland or salty. My party though got Alfredo, jumbolaya, ahi poke, and a pepperoni extreme pizza!

Services usually meets satisfaction until you have more then basic questions or needs.  Mind you, they aren't extreme requests.   One of my recent visit, There was misunderstanding about the bill, I felt the server could've done better about trying to fix the problem, instead he acted irritated and acted like it was too late since the card was swiped. We all know we can void a transaction so I'm not sure why he felt it was such a hassle to do so.  That didn't sit well with me or my group.  My experiences from past visits, the servers don't pay attention to the table and forget us or our orders or refills.   BJs usually packed especially on weekends so I'm sure my review won't tarnish them, but I hope whomever reads this can agree that what makes a good server is more than taking your order and asking if you want refills.  I treat people with respect and only ask for same.  We don't go out of our way to make your job or life hard, we just want to have a great experience and everyone has their needs be it allergy or calories, or just understanding the ingredients on menu.   Hopefully BJs sets standards where their employees are happy to work for them so then they can be happy to serve us.  Ex) in n out n chic filet  It doesn't have to be 5 star dining restaurant to few like you are being serviced.  Check out pho Le, love their service everytime I come there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=300

There wasnt really any reason to be there more than an hour and half. Well all i can say is dont ever get the waitress named stephanie s. One thing is she had an attitude to whole two and half hours we had to wait. When we got our food it was great besides mine and another person in the party. But i wasnt going to complain because i was already way to hungry. But when it took them 30 mins to come clear plates and another 35-40 mins to bring desserts on top of it being my friends birthday dinner was a little to ridiculous. Mind you at this point there isnt a big crowd and our server was no where to be seen along with having to speak to the manager twice and the manager finally clearing the last plate. We thought at least she had talked to her well it didnt appear to because asking for our checks three times and then having to flag down a busser along with talking to the front to get the manager back over it had already been 2hrs and 15mins. Then ontop of that we had seperate checks and she couldnt even get that right. Being someone who had worked in the restaurant industry before as a server when you have unhappy customers try to at least communicate. But when you cant even give me the correct number on how much im paying for my own food and add someone elses drink to my order after i had just seen my previous check saying 20 and it magically jumps to 33.... this doesnt sit well with me. Im sorry but after this incident i will not be eating here again. I will gladly spend my money somewhere else with customer service and give them a tip they deserve.

Need less to say we thought of going to some place in downtown, however due to the weather we decided on staying local! I can definitely say that was a big MISTAKE! So it was a FRIDAY night and I know many places tend to get busy! So I called in and put my name on the list so when we got there we wouldn't have to wait as long! So I called about 4:45Pm and put my name on the list and I was told it would be about an hour wait, so i was like ok not bad since my cousin will be back in town by then. My cousin arrives before I did and my cousin was told it is still an hour wait when it was already 5:45PM. So she calls me and tells me and I was like ok lets go to a different place, although that didn't make sense to me at all. So we decide to end up going to apple bee's although our first choice was BJ's! while we are on our way to Apple bee's I get a text message that our table was ready from BJ's! So I hurry up and call them and let them know we are on our way! However noone picks up the phone! SO I asked my mom to call and I kid you not they answered in one ring! So that was a little odd! So my mom tells them we are coming they don't say anything! we were already in the parking lot so I drop them off and went to look for parking! Minutes later my mom calls saying she was told it's still an hour wait, although we waited for so long! So I was totally upset and din not want to dine here at all! I call and speak to the manager VANESSA!! and explained to her the situation and she kindly told me that we should not have been told we would have to wait another hour, in fact we shoulde been seated right away! She insisted we come back and I chose not to since I got the run around! I simply told her she can send me something via my email and I would kindly return, she took my info down and she still has not reached out to me! WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!!!!

It's pretty much the go to place to eat if you want something good, you don't want to drive far, and there's something everyone in your group could eat.  Pretty much everything I have ordered here I have liked. There was this one time when I ordered fried calamari at the Roseville location and it looked nothing like how I usually get it. Aside from that, everything is good. The avocado egg rolls are really yummy if you're a vegetarian. I usually always get the Thai shrimp lettuce wraps. I just sprinkle some lemon on that bad boy and I'm a happy camper. I've also tried their pizzas and I just think they are amazing. Most of the enlightened menus are pretty good. You can never go wrong any of the pizookies. The beignet is ok.. I would rather order a pizookie any day.  Anyways, just went there a couple days ago. They have a new menu. I think they added about 9 things? Not sure. I didn't get a chance to try any of them but the scallops and the kale salad looks yummy. Will have to try those on my next visit.  I finally tried the tomato and mozzarella salad that I have been eyeing forever. I loved it! Probably gna be in my top favorites salads every time I go there. Also tried the new salted caramel pizookie. It was alright. Wouldn't order it again.. The giradhelli chocolate on top was a little too much for me.  As far as drinks .. I'm not the best to ask.

We had a Great White deep dish pizza and a Double Deluxe burger.  The pizza came out with marinara sauce, even though the menu said it was alfredo. So, I told the server and she told me that ALL of the pizzas come with red sauce as the base. There's alfredo in there, too, really! Okie doke. I'm not sure if their menus say that, but it didn't say anything about red sauce online at   For most people, this wouldn't be a big deal, I guess. I just don't like red sauces in my pizza, and it's jarring to get something you weren't expecting. On top of that, the cheese wasn't fully melted and the whole thing came out cold. The burger was supposed to come with all sorts of toppings, but we asked for it was just burger, bacon, and bun. They forgot the bacon. The burger was SUPER dry.

The salad on the other hand was not good tonight. The salmon was baked and greasy instead of grilled and delicious and was just bland. I guess I'm not supposed to know the difference and since it is to goThe salad was small in comparison to every other time and there was no avocado in the salad. Last the dressing was watery like they were running out and added water. So disappointed in my dinner tonight.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=260

Shaquila D.,"Sacramento, CA",1,41,,2.0,3/10/2017,It is now 945 and I am just getting home from bjs mind you I live literally 5 mins away. I just ordered two baked potatoes with broccoli and chicken and it literally took over 40 mins to make. Normally I am quite angry when I have to wait to eat but at that I'm pregnant and my child is probably more angry then me. After telling the cashier that the baby I'm my tummy is upset he said I'm sorry well one of your potatoes is done did you want to eat that whole the other one is done. Uh no I ordered take out not take out but eat in the restaurant. Idk I guess I expected more compassion when I told them how they were kinda not just starving me but also my little person and they didn't seem to really care. Don't get me wrong they said sorry but it wasn't an apology that I felt was real. I originally asked for my refund and was about to just leave but magically my food was ready. No point of starving the rest of the night I let them keep the money and left. Bjs may have just lost one of their regulars.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=260

Danny G.,"Sacramento, CA",300,57,113,3.0,7/14/2015,"I came here on Saturday July 11th and to be honest was pretty disappointed. Even though BJ's is in an area that I frequent I still don't come here very often. On this particular trip I was actually pretty disappointed with my visit. First off, when our drinks were brought out to us our waitress just placed them on the table and walked away. Suffice to say, we didn't know who's drink was who's and needed to do a taste test in order to know. Luckily, we were all family so germs weren't a huge issue. The next thing we noticed was that our chicken wings were not steaming hot. Yes, the outer crust was fried well but the temperature of the chicken meat was lukewarm. Within 30 mins, the 4 of us started to get slight stomach aches. I'm not saying it was because of the chicken but the only thing we ate were the wings and the 4 of us were not complaining of stomach issues until after we ate the wings.   This visit wasn't the best, I have had better experiences at this BJ's before I began yelping. I'll chalk it up to a somewhat busy Saturday night and write up a follow up review on my next visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=260
Kurt C.,"Sacramento, CA",694,407,2176,4.0,7/6/2014,"I've been to this location too many times not to review it.  Consistently good service. They do a great job maintaining the restaurant's casual yet sophisticated look. I always see a diverse group of people dining in, which is an indicator that they are very welcoming of any race and age group.  Jerry Burst! If you drink alcohol, try it. It's one of their beer and cider blends that I happen to be a fan of. It's Berry Burst cider and their very own house brew, Jeremiah Red. Good aroma of caramel malts, full-bodied, and a bit of hops to it. Taste like it smells, but more robust.  For my main course, I ordered from one of their enLIGHTened entrées -- the Maui Glazed Pork Chop. It was perfectly grilled, tender, with a little kick from the sweet and tangy sauce. It came with steamed green beans and oven roasted red potatoes.  And, of course, if you've heard of BJ's, you know to associate them automatically with their famous pizookie dessert. It's almost mandatory to have them at the end of your meal here. We got the trio this time with Salted Caramel, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut, and Cookies 'N' Cream.

Bruce S.,"Elk Grove, CA",237,361,2176,2.0,11/4/2014,A few months ago we received 2 $50 gift cards to BJ's. We went in 3 times for lunch to use them up. No reason to return again as this place is nothing special and the service isn't good. Their prices are high also. They make their own beer so why do the prices start at $5.00 a glass and go up? Not a good deal. All three times we ate there all our order came out at once. Not the appetizers first like we expected. Twice it seemed like we sat for quite a bit before our food came out. Once we got it the food was good enough. The last time we went in we had $13.00 left on the gift card so that means the first two visits averaged $43.50 each. That's too costly for lunch and we will never go back. My Wife had visited another BJ's previously and got sick after eating the calamari.

Ida H.,"Sacramento, CA",977,1010,10894,4.0,11/4/2012,"Ever since a BJ's opened in Elk Grove, this has been a favorite place of mine.  And even though it is a favorite, I haven't been able to eat here as often as I would have liked.  I have come here on several occasions and always enjoy the food, the lounge/sports bar, and the atmosphere.  Just sitting at the bar is nice and I have fond memories of hanging out with my girlfriend, splitting some appetizers.   While the menu offers a large selection of meals that will satisfy any appetite, including specialty salads, vegetarian and gluten free.  I was happy to see that they also have a section called ""Enlighted Entrees"".   This is where they keep the lower fat and calorie dishes - under 575 calories!  After careful thought, I chose the Creole Tilapia.  Our waitress was great and gave useful information that helped me with my decision.   It was a good choice, that had perfectly oven baked Tilapia topped with a salsa style sauce, seasoned rice, and a mixed green salad.  The flavor was there and satisfied my hunger sufficiently.  I felt like I could eat this huge amount of food and still comforted in the thought that it was all low in calories!  I was expecting a spicier version of fish, because Creole is used in the naming of this dish.  But it was still something that I would definitely order again!   We got very attentive service even in the middle of a shift change.  Three different servers (one in training), made us feel welcome with friendly smiles and pleasant small talk.  My boyfriend and I enjoyed our dining experience.  In the past, we would consider coming here for dinner, but then drive past when we saw a line at the front door.  But on this occasion, I was gently reminded that this place is huge inside, and accommodates a large crowd.   I don't think this will be a deterrent for us anymore!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=260

Mamie K.,"Elk Grove, CA",56,186,661,2.0,6/21/2015,"We hadn't been to BJ's in a while & decided to head there for dinner one evening.  As we thought, it was crazy busy.  Lots of people waiting (inside & out).  We only had a table for 4 that evening so we thought it should go a little quicker.  We were told it would be about a 30 min wait.  So not bad considering it was a Friday evening.  As we were waiting for our table, they brought out some pizza for people to nibble on. I looked around as they were seating people.  It was a little odd, noticed quite a few tables who were empty & sat empty for almost 20 minutes before they would seat people.  Not sure if they have new managers.  But noticed some of the booths which could easily seat us were being held for larger parties like 5.  This is a little odd considering the last time we had gone they told us those booths were too small for us & was only for parties of 4 or less.   After waiting for the 30 minutes, we finally got buzzed.  They took us to our table which was in the far corner of the restaurant.  We were seated and the server came over almost immediately to take our drink order.  At the same time, we place our order for an appetizer - Calamari. We received our drinks and shortly after placed our food order.  The calamari came out shortly.  As it was placed on the table, we just stared at our order in a little shock.  For the price, it seemed like 1/2 the order was missing (portions have definitely shrank).  Not sure if we will be ordering it again.  As we sat there staring, we were also looking at how we were going to eat our appetizer.  No place settings at all.  So I had to wave down the server to request napkins and utensils.  Soon after our order came out: Caifornia Flatbread Pizzas:  can't go wrong with flatbread pizzas - very good Ahi Tuna Salad:  lots of pepper on the ahi tuna; a tad bit too spicy - didn't realize there was smidges of wasabi on the sides of the plate, definitely gave the tuna a kick We did have to wave down our server several times to get our glasses filled with water.  Water glasses sat empty a little too long.  Not sure if it is a new policy on only filling the glasses with water if requested by the customer.  But they did not check on us to see if we needed additional refills.  I know they were busy (they did have a quite a few large tables).  Just felt service was subpar.  Not sure if we will be going back soon.  Our visits here are seldom due to the service we receive.  So will give a new review the next time we go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=260

I ordered their jambalaya, ahi poke, and a Caesar salad! Totaling to around $31 dollars.. The weird thing is whenever we order ahi poke during dine in, we only get a few cubes of avocado which is such a let down. But when I ordered through takeout, they gave so much avocado like how I expect it to be with the ahi poke. Maybe I should order more through takeout!

Alex H.,"Sacramento, CA",389,67,89,1.0,8/2/2014,"The quality of this BJ's has really gone down since it opened. Not only the food, but the service as well. This review is based on the past three experiences I've had here.  The food has been very mediocre and takes forever to come out. The pizza especially has gone down in taste. They're very bland and doughy tasting. My last order of BBQ Chicken came out luke warm. My calamari appetizer came out chewy. Their Chicken Fried Steak was less flavorful than in the past and they consider a few sprinkles of corn as a side of vegetables. The pizookies here have gotten ridiculously sweet to the point where it's very hard to eat more than a few spoonfuls. It's pretty disappointing.  The service here when seated is pretty good, but I've found that they tend to need reminding and don't come around that often. My water was left unattended on multiple visits and my beer and condiments i requested almost never got to me. One of my servers started completely ignoring me after I got my food. He walked past our table time and time again without saying a word. I had to flag him down to get his attention. I definitely wouldn't recommend this place to anyone and I doubt I'll be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=260

VeeVee N.,"Fresno, CA",60,624,11980,3.0,6/9/2014,"Came here on a busy Friday night w/ a large group. The wait time was long, but expected. We arrived at 6pm and weren't seated till a little after 730pm.  We were seated, but it took a minute for them to figure out who our server was going to be. A girl in our party was noticed by an old friend of hers, who was a server, and he offered to get us started. With our large party it took a while to get our drinks. We tried some 'hand crafted' soft drinks like Root Beer and Cherry something or other. I took a few drinks of my Cherry drink, but it tasted like it was made w/ a sweetener. I do not like artificial sweeteners, so I asked him if I could have a Pepsi because I did not like the sweet after taste of this drink. He came back w/ the same drink!!! He thought there was something wrong w/ the drink and that I just wanted a new one. My regular pepsi did not come out till I was almost finished w/ my meal. We ordered 3 apps...mozzarella sticks, and some boneless buffalo wings in Maui Sweet & Garlic Parmesan. We ordered these two flavors cause there were kids in our party and didn't want anything spicy. We were very disappointed when we bit into the Maui Sweet and found they were incredibly spicy, even for the adults. What was even more disappointing is that on their menu it states that the boneless wings are served w/ 10pcs...however we only received 5-6 pcs. Our appetizers came out at separate times, our waiter comped one of them because it was so late...just came out right before we got our dessert. The mozzarella sticks are not bad, but they aren't good either. They are way different from the traditional fried mozzarella that most people are used to getting. The breading was strange and had ZERO flavor at all. The only thing that made it edible was drowning it in Marinara sauce.  The boneless wings were good, had a nice flavor, crunch an the chicken was good. The only bad thing was that they were waaaay too hot to enjoy. I cant really do hot stuff, but others in our party that do even complained about how hot they were. Didnt get a chance to try to Garlic Parmesan since they brought them out just right before dessert. Service in between was hit and miss. There was also the earlier confusion of not having a designated waiter, and the kid that had been helping us was apparently not supposed to and so 2 managers came out and scolded him right behind our table. I think that was tacky on their part, there is a reason why they have an office or seperate place in the back...hell, go yell at him in the kitchen. Shame on the management though for not having a designated server for us. This boy tried to help us when he saw that nobody else was...so kudos to him. I felt bad cause he worked so hard, and then another person came in and took over...I hope she split the tip w/ him. Our food came out an everything looked delicious. I ordered the mini Chicken, Bacon, Ranch deep dish pizza. I am no longer going to order pizza from here, unless it is the regular hand tossed variety. Their deep dish is a joke. Basically you are praying for a disc of bread sprinkled w/ a few toppings...totally not worth it. The tomatoes that were on top were like the ones that you would get from taco bell, there was barely and bacon or ranch. I asked for an extra side of ranch because there was no detectable amount on my pie, and I never received it. It was a waste of almost $11 for a giant loaf of bread...NEVER A G A I N!!! Another person in our party ordered the Balsamic Glazed Chicken and it was so delicious!!! They were served on white cheddar mashed potatoes, although you couldnt really taste the 'cheddar' at all. The chicken was cooked to perfection and the crispy onion strings on top were a nice touch. The plate was very aesthetically pleasin and almost looked too good to eat. I wish I would have chose this as my entree on this visit...I def will next time. For dessert we had the Peanut Butter Pazookie. I think I am also going to hang it up where this is concerned. The Pazookie always takes longer than the other desserts, but every time I order one it comes out w/ some parts undercooked. I have maybe had it one or two times where it was fully cooked. I just don't like biting into what's supposed to be a cookie, and end up pretty much eating cookie dough. The flavor is not bad, but probably wont be something I order again. The girl who stepped in to help us really brought her best game and had no problems. I think the management really needs to step up their game and get their teams organized, thats what they are getting paid extra for. I think one of them should have at least apologized to our table...they were already there chewing the one server out, so why not say 'Hey folks, sorry for the trouble...' I mean our party spent almost $300 there. The food here is typically good and there are plenty of choices #flagproof",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=200

The waitress we got was a bit ""Lost""at times but that wasn't the problem. I ordered the classic ribeye med-rare and it came well done. That was couple cook beyond what I'd asked for. Worse part was, they tried to kill me with salt ""overdose""! It seems as they took all the salt from the salt farm and put it on my plate. So  I asked for new steak to be cooked med-rare and no salt on my food. After 10min later I got my new plate of food, this time I didn't have to worry about dying from salt Overdose, but damn the steak was nasty enough to make me loose my appetite. They took a frozen steak, dipped it boiling water and threw it on the grill for a minute. You can see the whiteness from being boiled and you can taste the water squirting out as you chew. I made a mental note to self, "" Never order steak from this place again if I'd ever come back!"" Eat at your own RISK!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=200

Then i got the bill and it was full price and the server said i promise this one doesnt have one of my hairs in it.

Also, a lot of the times, it is crowded, but they do try to get you seated as soon as possible. One thing I do recommend though is the pizzooki (not sure if I spelled that right). It's sooooo good.

Kevin T.,"Diamond Bar, CA",40,80,74,3.0,7/18/2013,"Best Beginnings Appetizer Combo: - Came with 8 small santa fe spring rolls, 4 mozzarella sticks, 4 avocado egg rolls, and a small bowl of chips and spinach & artichoke dip. And all with their own type of dipping sauce. - Perfect for a group of 4 people. We were actually pretty well off with just this appetizer (as in full enough) so when the pizza came we were definitely full after a single slice. Everything on the platter was really heavy, from the bountiful of avocado in the large egg roll and cheesy dip. Tasted great, but the heaviness basically is what made us filled up. BJ's Favorite Deep Dish Pizza: - Crispy bottom on the crust. But more like a crumbly crispy since the crust was kind of dry. - Nothing spectacular about the pizza. Good taste, but too ordinary for sit-down restaurant pizza (as in a more ""upscale"" place).

He informed us my meal would be complimentary.  I did indeed receive a California Burger with potato wedges.  That was the only thing right about my order.  The bottom bun was soggy like it had been sitting a while.  The burger was on the verge of being cold.  The burger had a pink stripe in the middle indicating it was cooked medium and not well done as ordered.  They are pathetic. We are a small group that on Wednesdays visit local restaurants.  We will not be going back to BJ's of Elk Grove.  I find it amusing that there are plaques on the walls outside the front door that indicate the names of the site manager and assistant manager and they are ""share holders of the company.""

r l.,"Lodi, CA",36,589,33965,4.0,5/31/2012,"Yesterday... on a Bike Ride to the Elk Grove area... After arriving within the City Limits of Elk Grove by Bicycle yesterday, I was salivating over the thought of a Guiness Float which I had last month at a drinking establishment in downtown Sacramento... which satisfied my craving for Ice Cream and Alcohol and was absolutely refreshing. I worked my way West-ward on Elk Grove Boulevard stopping at almost every drinking establishment looking for a place that served Root Beer Floats... knowing that finding a place that served Guiness Floats would probably be fruitless. I went through countess restaurants perusing their Menus till I happened on BJs on Laguna... read their framed menu posted at the entrance... Voila! There it is... a ""BJ's Handcrafted Root Beer Float"" !!! On the menu... Custom-made Guiness Float (**** 1/2 $6.75) (   ) Now... this is why I chose BJs over any other drinking establishment in Elk Grove! I took a seat at the Bar knowing that I had to have a ""personal"" relationship with the Bar-tender. I described the Guiness Float I had a month ago... Two Scoops of Vanilla Ice Cream dropped into some Guiness and then some Guiness to top it off... ""Can you do it?"" The Bartender replied... ""I'll do my best..."". When the Bartender returned with his concoction... I have to say... BJs is great on presentation... even with an improvised on-the-spot Dessert / Drink. The Pint Glass was literally frothing over the sides of the glass, with wisps of vapor emanating from the sides and the top of the Dessert... reminiscent of something made by a mad-scientist in a Horror Flick! And the Dessert Drink really hit the spot... especially on a very Hot Bicycle Ride yesterday! If there was any criticism though... it would be some experimentation... I requested two scoops of Ice Cream... for those with sweeter taste buds, it'd be best to ask for three. And the Ice Cream at BJs is of the soft type - more like a soft-serve rather than the frozen type. Maybe a request to place the scoops of Ice Cream in the freezer then to make the Float at the end of your meal might be preferable.  Stayed for some... Wyder's Pear Cider (***** $6.95) (   ) Prefer Cider over Beer... anytime, any day of the week. Other options were a Berry Cider or a Belgian Framboise (Beer)... Question to BJs... What about Apple Cider? A visiting Englishman wouldn't recognize the Ciders at BJs... Black & Bleu Burger (** 1/2 $10.25) (   ) (   ) (   ) Blackened half-pound Angus pattie with a melted, creamy Bleu Cheese topping, with Applewood smoked Bacon, roasted Garlic Aioli and Tomatoes between some toasted and Buttered Artisan Hamburger Buns... with a side of seasoned Wedge-Cut Fries.  Between the Blackened Hamburger Pattie and the Bleu Cheese... you would think this would be... ""One Tasty Burger!"" . Nope. Despite the handsome presentation of the entree... 1) the toated and buttered Hamburger Buns were rather Dry, very Dry... on the verge of imminent staleness. 2) BJs has to learn how to Blacken meat... when you Blacken anything, there is a degree of Saltiness... and this Hamburger just lacked that flavor. 3) Bleu Cheese lacked sharpness and flavor... it might as well been any kind of Cheese other then Bleu. 4) Wedge Fries... count em... only about a dozen wedges or so. Such stinginess at BJs... Seansoned? With what?  After the meal, asked the Bartender how much would it cost to upgrade a Burger at BJs to a 1-Pounder... $3.99 for an extra Hamburger Pattie... Hmm... Looks like I won't be having any 1-Pound Burgers at BJs anytime soon.... I could direct you to my favorite place to get a Black & Bleu... but then you'd accuse me of just being a promoter... From the Greeter at the entrance of BJs to the Bartender, who obligingly listened to me and concocted my Guiness Float... the people at BJs are some of the nicest and cordial service people I've met at a restaurant. On the verge of being syrupy nice... seemingly cultishly nice - too good to be true. Maybe I'll ask for a Cider Float next time at my local BJs... After this Brunch / Lunch yesterday... between the Guiness Float and the Pear Cider I had a buzz leaving the restaurant... I could not work off the buzz until after ten miles of Bike Riding during the ride back to Lodi. Made it back, though, as you can see...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=400

This is our spot to go to when we all just want to get together to hang out, celebrate something, or decompress from a long work/school week. We go here so much that our regular waitress, Sarah, remembers us each time (she's such an awesome waitress, btw). If you want to catch a big sports event, this is a good place to go to... But I recommend getting there early because it gets packed! They have plenty of tvs for you to watch the biggest sporting event going on that day, so I'm sure you can sit anywhere and be in sight of a TV.  My friends and I love the bar area. Now as far as the main dining area... Well, we try to avoid it. Depending on when you go, there's usually a wait. I, personally, haven't had a lot of good experiences with customer service with the waiters/waitresses in the main dining area. Whether they're slow at getting you a refill, or sending down the wrong order... There has always some kind of negative experience in the dining area.  The 4 stars are mainly for the bar and it's service there. Always an enjoyable time with the homies.. And great for happy hour.  My recommendations: Any of their craft beers...

Scott F.,"Elk Grove, CA",2,15,1,2.0,2/4/2015,So this is the 3rd time I have been in there and saw everyone else arround me get Sat and get drinks before we did. I shouldn't have to sit there for 15 mins to be asked what I would like to drink. I then went up to the front and asked them to take my order and the floor manager walked by me 3 times looking for a waiter to take it and still nothing. Great manager...  Service is half of the business restaurants and apparently in this generation it's ok to be lazy and not care about you're job.  The food here is ok. It tastes good but nothing special. Not worth waiting around for.  We tip way above very good even if the food is crappy. As long as the service is good like they actually care about their job.  I am in customer service myself and people get the million dollar service no matter how little of money is spent and I don't expect a tip. I would rather be thanked for good service. Bj's doesn't care... It's sad. Good luck,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=440

When your salad arrives order your entree... Many a time I've had a table over stuffed with food items and feeling rushed.  Things to try Deep dish pizza, good toppings, ask them to cook it extra long for a crunchier crust.  Burgers, never had a fail here, juicy and well presented.

It really gave it a nice kick next was the BLT salad (a personal favorite when I come in but the spinach wasn't washed so I didn't finish Henze the 4 stars) and broccoli cheese soup. For our meal we had the Bacon and blue burger and let me tell you it was melt in your mouth amazing. Its been a long time since I had a burger that good. Paired it with the Jeremiah red on tap.

The server put in the wrong pitcher order, finally got our pitcher of cider an hour later with no glasses, didn't write down our requests so they came out wrong, she disappeared most of the two hours it took from seating to cashing out, other servers had to assist our table, as the designated driver they didn't even comp my iced tea, and we got dessert AFTER the bill and to-go box came!!  I have never complained, until last night, but I couldn't take it anymore!  The manager was just as rude and non-service oriented as the rest of the crew.  He didn't even bother to cash me out when I complained about the bill, so I had to flag down the server, again!  The manager's attitude explains a lot! I should've yelped before going out for my daughters birthday, even though we really tried to have a good time, it was tainted by the wicked witch of the serving crew.  $70 for pizza and cider!?  Really, I should have called into Round Table for home delivery, That would have been a lot more fun!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=420

I called a few days in advance knowing that it may be difficult to squeeze in 12 people on a Friday night after work.  I called BJs and spoke with their bookkeeper Sarah who was able to make a reservation for 630 PM on that Friday.  She forewarned us that we needed at least half of the people present before we could be seated and said she would try her best to get the table but could not promise that the table would be ready at 630 PM on the dot.  She was great with communicating everything to me so that I could rely the message to our friends and coworkers. My husband and I arrived at 630 PM on the dot (we only had two other people with us) and the hostess quickly seated us saying that our table was ready.  What?! Really, that's awesome.  It felt great to bypass all the 20+ people waiting in the front that didn't make a reservation (SUCKERS!). Our table was in the smaller room to the left and it was perfect.  They set out 12 seats for our party and our waitress came by to take our drink orders.  The rest of our party trickled in a few moments later.   The food was decent but the company and customer service made the experience that much better.  Although we didn't order any pizza (we ordered avocado egg rolls, soup and salad) but the dinner we did get was pretty good.  Nothing spectacular but good enough to enjoy!  We never skip on dessert so we ordered the Pizookie Trio (DELICIOUS).

Julie K.,"Sacramento, CA",31,78,137,3.0,9/24/2011,"My first time to a BJ's!! I thought our waiter was pretty hot. He was very attentive when we arrived. We must've sent him away like 7 times when he came to take our order. We were busy chatting away the entire time, sorry hot guy.  His service was pretty good up until we ordered dessert. After we ordered the dessert, he gave us the bill before we received our dessert.  In his defense, it was pretty busy and jam-packed while we were there--apparently a norm at BJ's. Plus we were the only table that stayed there from a little before 7 until midnight. ..Still, it would've been nice to have our waters refilled again while we were having that sweet sweet dessert--and for the 2.5hours afterwards as we lounged and chatted away. Was he not satisfied with his tip on the bill? I ordered a Chicken A La Fresca, while my companion ordered his usual-- some pasta dish.  My enlightened entree was ""okay-good"": the chicken was succulent and flavorful, but the rice was buttery *dislike*!!  Luckily the mushroom sauce cloaks the buttery taste a bit, so it's not too bad if you mix it together. Portion-wise, it was decent. We had the famous Pizookie for dessert-- half white chocolate macademia nut, half chocolate chip, topped-off with a scoop of vanilla ice cream-- Did you know you can have a half-n-half Pizookie?! My companion (who's a BJ's regular btw) sure as heck didn't. Our waiter was kind enough to tell us when we were debating which of the two flavors to get. Too bad he didn't refill our waters when he took our dessert order. I suppose he could've been telling us to leave and make way for new customers by not refilling our waters.. And if that was his plan, too bad for him, it failed. We stayed there 'til closing despite being parched. Sorry, hot waiter guy. =OP""   One star off for us dying of thirst for 3+hours. Another off for the buttered rice--1) they should've put ""buttery rice pilaf"" on the menu, and 2) the buttery rice doesn't go well with the chicken!! Thank goodness for the mushroom sauce! [Guestimation on the 5hour stay: Half-hour before we were ready to order, half-hour for the food to arrive, one hour to consume, half-hour for Pizookie (arrival and consumption), and lounging about the rest of the time].--Hey, time flies when you have good company. =O)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=460

Always, always expect trouble parking, and waiting outside for at least 25-30min for a table to open up. But hey, it's a decent restaurant chain and everything we ordered was good. Among the group, some opted for the special which was $19.95 for two people's worth of food (including appetizers and dessert)...we otherwise got avocado eggrolls, ahi tuna poke with fried wonton to start, and some beer. Main dishes ranged from pizza to fish to bison burger to calzone and macaroni and chese. On a good day the nomster in me can polish off a calzone ""for two"" but this time I got the calzone for one and the small plate of macaroni and cheese. Calzone was good, dough wasn't underdone, artichoke hearts, cheese, spinach all good together. The mac and cheese though: it looked like rotini, with a thin creamy sauce, and Goldfish crackers on top. It's saving grace was the bacon. The waiter comped us three mini pizookies so that was nice and yummy too. Roast beef dip I took to go was made right before we paid the bill so it was still warm to take home as well.

Devona Y.,"Elk Grove, CA",169,84,35,4.0,3/10/2012,"3 words. BABY BACK RIBS. delicious :) full rack for $20 .. on the pricey side ? yeah. but it is a restaurant. And the meat is just right. It just melts off the bones. If that doesn't get you.... It does come with a giant baked potato and a choice of soup or salad. I think its worth it if you're sharing for two . $10 each person.. not too bad i'd say. & its plenty of food for two.  They got this special for mondays where selected drinks are $5.  I can only remember two drinks on that list though because those were the two me and a friend ordered. haha. It was the Lemon Drop and the Cosmopolitan.  The Cosmo was made a little bit too strong. My friend had to have the drink remade and then had grenadine added to it. But still didn't satisfy her. The lemon drop on the other hand I had no problem with. I loved the sugar they had on the rim of my cup. haha.  But anyways. Don't get me started on the pizookies though. Now thooose are delicious. It's like a must have whenever you visit Bj's. Yeah, you can make it at home but come'on it's more delicious at a restaurant.  They even got a red velvet  pizzookie!  My sweet tooth is definitely satisfied with one of these.  I always get good service here. Except.. dun dun dunnn....Today. I had called in the morning at least 5 hours beforehand for a table at 6:30. This is a reservation for my sister and her friends. And they're a couple of teens. But besides the point. The party all arrived by 6:20. You'd think it'll be alright to be seated at 6:30 on account on being early and having everyone there. Nope! The girl at the front says the wait would be 1 hour and 30 minutes. Come'on!!!!! I didn't call and set up reservations just to have them wait an 1hr30min !  I immediately asked to speak to a manager and he was nice enough to get them seated ASAP. He was really polite about it too. They got seated at 6:45, so everything was all good after that.

Sherrine K.,"Davis, CA",107,49,6,1.0,8/4/2015,"The food is good don't get me wrong, but when you have service 3 times in a row that's shitty.... I think that was my family's last time going there. Each occasion we were judged by how we were dressed.  Occasion 1: dressed well due to going out shopping in Walnut Creek and returning back to EG and not wanting to cook. The server seemed to have a bad day, and took that out on us. She never came by to see how the food was tasting, nor did she make the experience extraordinary... So we felt she didn't really deserve a tip. We left 10% because we aren't assholes. I for one am a bartender prior, and have never had or given such stupid service. Keep your mood elsewhere. Because when she came to pick up the check, this pretentious little server decided to gawk at it and what? You think you deserve 20$ for not doing anything for us??? We saw the busser more than you! Occasion 2: We had a long day during Ramadan, and didn't want to cook a terribly long meal. So we came out here again, despite the bad service. Now dressed in PJ's, basically, we received bad service again from this man. He was taller, had brown hair, and looked about 27. He frickin doesn't give us service. He spent more times at the other tables than ours. He would laugh with them, and then come to us and look at us like we weren't worth his time. Jokes on him, my mom owns one of the most prestigious salons and is well off, and my man runs a luxury car dealership. So we aren't broke. But for bad service, I notice all this stuff. Because at my old restaurant job, we were told never to treat anyone bad or to judge by looks. Just to GIVE GOOD SERVICE.  Occasion 3: This is where I was BEYOND LIVID. We came back from a wedding, and since eating super early, we came in later in the evening and wanted to eat again. Now we love the food which is why we come here, but this is our last time coming for sure. We had a thicker lady server who looked 30 something. She was okay at first, but I saw that the male server from Occasion 2 spoke with her while walking away... (i know this tactic. ""Watch out they aren't gonna tip you well.""). As soon as she came back we all noticed she was different. She gave us glares, shook her head when walking away when we weren't ready to place an order, and never really refilled waters... Sipping on ice is not cool. They wanted to give her $40 dollar tip on a $110 dollar check because they were in good spirits from the wedding, but we were arguing because honestly she didn't deserve it. Especially with her tag team partner. I don't know how much in the end they tipped because I was irked and left early.  Management: CHOOSE BETTER SERVERS. Not older entitled people who use serving as their career because they couldn't get a normal job due to their attitude and judgmental behavior.

Lycan L.,"Rocklin, CA",0,14,,1.0,9/22/2016,"I usually love BJ's and the food has always been good but I went to this location and had the worst service ever. I went with my brother and 4 business partners and all I ordered was a burger. This female waitress took my order and we waited until we had a bigger table to sit at because the table we had was small, but anyways we all ordered and switch tables. Everybody received there food except me, and at first I thought they were just taking time to make my burger but then 25 minutes passed and I still haven't received my food so I waited for the waitress to come back. She walked pass and ask if I was okay I told her I haven't gotten my food but she was in her own world and just said glad to hear like I said something else and walked off and I waited another 15 minutes. She finally walks by again and I told her my dilemma and she said oh really let me check. She finally comes back and says the servers drop my burger at the wrong table and basically made me waited for no reason. I'm pretty piss at this moment because my whole group was basically done with there food while I'm still waiting, she tells me they'll have your burger any minute and she walks off. 35 minutes pass and I still waiting for my burger and then she finally brings my burger and man was I disappointed. The burger was greasy from top to bottom and seem like they rushed it and it just tasted soggy and gross. I can't believed I paid for a crappy burger with crappy service, I'm never coming to this BJ again.

When I ask how much longer till I'm seated the girls in the front told me they already called me. I was right out front of the restaurant and could hear them calling everyone else but me and no text. Then another girl checked the list and said they didn't call me and instead of looking at me in my face and just telling me herself, she puts her head down and tells the girl next to her to tell me I would be seated next. then I sit back down and no more then 5 min they called another party of 5 when I'm also a party of 5. Then I went in to ask why they couldn't seat me and they said well we did tell u it would be a 30 to 40 min wait. Now a totally different girl talking out her ass before she knows  what's going on. Then the girl who took my name told her Ive been waiting for almost an hour. So instead of admitting they skipped me they don't know what to do and all get stuck, and I have to just tell them to ""just make something happen"" before any of them move and even try to figure something out. It's so sad that's who they have running there greeting. Ow yeah.... And when I finally got seated and got my food, I find a hair in my good.

Kristen C.,"Sacramento, CA",13,39,,1.0,3/11/2014,"This is, by far, the worst BJ's at which I've eaten. I really enjoy this chains' food and beer, but this specific restaurant severely lacks in customer service. Recently, my boyfriend and I decided to order some takeout from this BJ's after finishing up some shopping in Elk Grove. Initially, we attempted to call for Curbside Takeout. We called, got transferred, then waited on hold for over three minutes before we got fed up and hung up. For whatever reason, we still thought it's be a good idea to head down there and order food in person. The host directed us over to the Curbside Takeout counter. No one was there. I think it finally took ten minutes for someone to realize that we had been waiting. Granted, the place looked pretty packed/busy for a non-weekend night, but I saw at least a half dozen staff members walk past us. No one helped us and no one bothered to answer the phones that rang on and off either. Finally, someone darted out of the kitchen and took our order. This guy obviously seemed rushed and frazzled, but seemed to get all the details entered in correctly and took our payment. We ordered two specialty salads and a fried appetizer. He told us the order would take about 15-20 minutes. Great! Especially we needed to be back in South Sacramento for another commitment in a little over an hour. Fifteen, twenty, thirty, thirty-five minutes passed. Multiple people came and went with their food orders. Multiple servers were standing around the main station at the entrance of the restaurant. An off-duty employee came in, picked up her food, then took some time to go back behind the counter and talk to those that were working. Still no sight of our food. Finally, my boyfriend, who rarely gets mad, stood and waited up at the pick-up counter for five minutes before someone addressed him. This guy, who replaced the one who took our order, heard my boyfriend's complaints, which centered around the total miscommunication with the time frame for our order and our expectations not being met by this experience. (If we knew it was going to take 30-45 minutes we just wouldn't have ordered food and would have gone elsewhere.) This guy was nice and did everything he should have done - checking on the order in the computer and the kitchen, updating us, offering us drinks, then finally getting the manager after our order still wasn't produced. We both felt genuinely bad for this guy since this mess was totally not his fault and we thought he did a decent job with the situation he was given. (Can't remember his name, unfortunately.) The salads came out and the appetizer came out ten minutes later. At that point, we were explaining things to the manager who offered to return the food, which didn't make any sense because we had been waiting for forty five minutes at that point and we had already paid. In the end, we unhappily took our food and raced home with barely any time to eat before our commitment that night. As we checked on the food in the car, we discovered that the chicken in my salad was cold and both salads looked horribly underwhelming and small. For all we know, the salads were made in five or ten minutes then, for whatever reason, the fried appetizer somehow took thirty minutes to drop in the fryer. The appetizers were also not crispy and seemed lacking in ingredients. Absolutely ridiculous. When we ate the food at home, it was alright. I just couldn't enjoy it because of the experience we just had. We will not be visiting this BJ's again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=580

From am to pm! this review is for my visit earlier the year, March 2012) Food: Chicken Fettuccine in Alfredo Sauce, I really enjoyed the pasta but not the chicken part. I wanted to enjoy it but it was just so bland and chewy. Took me too long to chew the strip of chicken just so i can swallow it. They portion was just right, not skimpy. The pizza here was different from the pizza i eat. Here it was fluffy and deep dished. We had the cheese burger pizza or somethin like that, It didnt taste as good as I hear.  Service: Nothing spectacular, nothing amazing. They are just too busy to really give you the service you deserve. It's pretty much you get seated, they take order and come back with food and rarely check on you. Drinks takes forever to be refilled. They get busy so it is understandable, but when you see them chatting it off while youre waiting 20 minutes after being seated (not including the 15+ minutes wait to be seated)... Gets annoying amd irritating. This place isn't what I would expect, due to the fact it's always busy... until a better visit, i wouldn't recommend this place for good food or service.

First, the Restaurant is always packed. Hope you're not that hungry when you visit, because you'll most likely be waiting forty five minutes to an hour. I was offered to sit at the bar, which was packed, but not exactly what I wanted with a date in tow. Second, the service is terrible! Don't expect to be greeted at the door, they're too busy trying to cram people into tables. If you're lucky enough to sit down, order right then and there or you'll be waiting a while for a return visit from the wait staff. Third, the food was good. Only redeeming quality this place has.

G S.,"Sacramento, CA",1,3,4,4.0,10/26/2013,"Came here for lunch today with a friend. I ordered ""BJs Favorite"" personal deep dish pizza and a salad. For the size I ordered it would've been $14.95 and $2.35 extra for the salad. The waiter then mentioned that for a couple dollars more I can get the pizza special for 2 (and just save the rest for dinner). It came with a bigger pizza, choice of salad or soup, and a pizzokie to finish it all off. All of that for $19.95!!! So of course, I opted for that instead. I also got the Oktoberfest beer just to be festive. My friend ordered the shrimp jambalaya which was what I was originally going to get. The pizza was just ok. The sausages on there didn't look that great. And, I'm not sure but it didn't seem cooked all the way. I had a lot leftover and ate it that night. It was not good at all. Normally, you can eat leftover pizza cold but this one had to be heated up! The salad was good though. I had more than enough being just a side salad. The beer was good too. I had a taste of my friend's jambalaya and it was delicious. Perfect amount of spice. So, as far as food goes, it all depends on what you order.  Service was great. Our waiter had great customer service and was very helpful with the meal. He definitely helped me get the most out of my money! Wish I remembered his name.  Although my pizza wasn't that great, I'd still come back. The people there were nice. The atmosphere was nice.

It was not very tasty but cooked nicely. Well, when I got the bill... It said salmon dinner... I asked why and the waiter said I ordered the bowl and it is the same price. I ended up arguing with him because he told me if I don't specifically say LUNCH bowl, then you automatically get the more expensive dinner size. What?  He told me I didn't say anything so therefore that's what I got. I ordered at a little after 12 noon and he couldn't ask if I wanted the lunch size or the dinner size? And then he says, ""Well you did pretty good and ate it all.""  By then I was obviously annoyed with this and he said he would fix the bill to the lunch-size price. I suggest that if there is a choice, then the waiter should ask the diner what size they want... He said he only does that on weekdays. That's just ridiculous. Humph.

Kyle G.,"Los Angeles, CA",119,165,30,3.0,6/18/2012,"I came here with my mom after it became apparent that Paesano's is *the* place to be on Tuesdays at 5. I know it's really important to be seen at a happenin' spot in Elk Grove and all, but we were really hungry, so we opted to dine elsewhere. And thus BJ's. The service here wasn't really ""bad,"" it just wasn't really great. At first, our waiter was really energetic and stuff about changing our dishes (eliminating the cheese from the bruschetta and pasta, leaving the bell peppers out of my mom's fish dish. She doesn't like bell peppers), which got us kinda excited to have our food just the way we wanted it. I don't know if he forgot or just didn't care or what. The pasta dish indeed had no cheese (he pointed it out very enthusiastically), but there was cheese in the bruschetta and bell peppers with the fish. We didn't point it out, because he seemed so happy with himself. Actually we didn't point it out because we're both the type of people who are like ""hum dee dum should we say something??? How can we fix this without making a fuss????"" So ultimately my mom picked out the bell peppers and I didn't eat bruschetta. Just to be complainy, I'll add that many of the pine nuts in my dish were burnt. Also, I had to add like 4 cups of salt for it to have any detectable flavor (I might be exaggerating), but I guess that's just personal preference... Overall, the food was decent, it was served quickly... And thankfully only 2/3 of what we ordered... wasn't what we ordered. The place is clean, though, and stuff like this doesn't always happen, so I won't be too harsh with the rating. BJ's gets points as a restaurant because some of its menu items can be veganized. I also like their handcrafted beers. I'd go back when I'm in town, too. That's partly because my options are limited, though (and BJ's is open pretty late).

Margaret T.,"Sacramento, CA",131,97,37,2.0,1/28/2014,"This review is based on my last visit here. We were a big party but got seated right away but service was slow and sloppy. We came around 8:30pm on a Wednesday, the restaurant was not busy. After taking our order it took more than 30 mins for our salads to come out. We ordered appetizers too but those came about 15 min AFTER the salads which was a little backwards. After waiting another 30 min our food came out - COLD. the cheese on our pizzas had that waxy, been sitting there look and were not warm. The pans were even cool to the touch. Our food was the same way. We even asked  to reheat our pizzas and the waitress kinda stood there and then told another waitress ""They said they want them reheated because they think they're cold, here"" and shoved them off like it was our fault. After reheating and having to wait about 2 hours for our main courses to arrive we just boxed it up and went home.  They get 2 stars because I know they have given great service to us In the past.

Joe K.,"Rocklin, CA",233,197,162,2.0,5/28/2012,"I've been to BJ's many times in the past at other locations and never had any issues with the food. The waiter, Joe was attentive, friendly, and always on point. I ordered the pork chops and after receiving it I wanted to send it back. The pork chops were so overcooked that I was having a tough time cutting into it with a steak knife.  The chops were also unflavored and just all-in-all bad, period. At least my raspberry iced tea was good. If I could rate the service, it would be at least 4 star and the food was 1 star. Oh well, it sucks but it is what it is. Maybe management will see this review and make sure unseasoned, overcooked, and burnt pork chops don't terrorize another unsuspecting patron.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=600

Mrs C.,"Sacramento, CA",3,54,4,2.0,6/8/2014,"Patronized the restaurant on Saturday June 7, 2014 and found it to be very busy in the bar area. Service was very slow initially but improved. The steak was cooked as ordered but over seasoned with a heavy salt which overpowered the flavor of the meat. The cook has the grill time correct but is misguided in believing that a little seasoning is good so a lot of seasoning is even better. Don't order the ""Wedge"" salad as it is simply a slice of white head lettuce with a sprinkling of condiments lacking flavor or appeal. Overall, the meal was ok but that being combined with the slow service will cause us to not to visit again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=600

We have come here quite a few times and had a enjoyable time and food so when we had relatives visit we decided to go there. We were extremely disappointed. First off it took more than 10 minutes after being sat for somone to even acknowledge we were there. They said that it wasn't her table but will take our drink order. 5 minutes later our waitress showed up to take our drink order. We told her it was already taken. She took our food order. My son and I ordered burgers medium. My son wanted only lettuce and tomatoes on it. He also ordered a bowl of clam chowder and my self a ceasar salad as a starter. Took forever for our food to come. They brought his clam chowder out with the spoon submerged in the soup handle and all. They also completely forgotmy salad which I decided to forgo since our meal had showed. Our burgers were well done/burnt. They forgot my sons lettuce and put the tomatoes on the side. My wife got one of her usuals the brussel sprout salad. It was not at all the quality what she has had before. Lettuce not fresh and sprouts were small and few. So the quality of service and food has totally fallen.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=600

I have dined here on a few occasions, but my last stop was to pick up a couple of party platters for a Bridal Shower I was helping host. When I went in to pre-order my dishes (caesar salad and fettuccine alfredo with grilled chicken) I was assured  the party trays were generous and filled. However, when I picked up the food a week later, the pasta tray was only half full with little to no alfredo sauce. The pasta was so dry and flavorless, it did not impress me or the guests. When I placed the order for the salad I was offered a variety of salad dressings on the side, but when I picked it up I was only given one type. Although I was given plenty of napkins and utensils, it would have been helpful to provide serving utensils on top of it.

I let them know that and told them I didn't want to eat anymore and I didn't.  Then we come to pay, we gave our waitress the right amount, and before giving her the check with the money, we checked like 3 times. She comes back and says we are missing $17.54, so we checked everything again and the full amount was there.

Lisa H.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",124,306,17,3.0,12/20/2012,"Normally I would probably rate BJ's a little higher since we come quite often as a family and typically have decent experiences (it would never be above a four star, however). But we came here yesterday with a group of 12 from work for our holiday celebration and they really messed up our group dining experience. I have been here for groups before and they were fine, so I am going to chalk this up to an anomoly, otherwise I probably would have rated this even lower. First off it took a while to be seated even though we had reservations and then it took them a while to bring menus. Ordering seemed to go okay. Personally I try to order as simply as possible in group situations just because things can get messed up easily. Things got very messed up quickly. My food was fine. I got a buger melt and it was satisfying. However, one person in our party had ordered a pizza with no onions and when they brought it, sure enough there were onions. Someone else's soup was lukewarm and someone else had ordered a bowl of soup and recieved a cup. When she asked if it was a cup, they confirmed that it was and she said she wanted a bowl. They said they would bring her another cup to make up for it. She never got her other cup or her brushetta that she ordered. Everyone was done eating and she asked the waitress for her brushetta to go. The waitress was like ""you didn't get it?"" and looked around the table like she was lying. When the bill came she was also charged for a bowl of soup. The new pizza also had to be boxed to go as it never came out during our two hour lunch. Multiple people were also charged seperate entree prices for items that were lunch specials. It took even longer to get the bill straigtened out.  BJ's is almost always crowded, so try and come on less busy times or in small groups unless you want to wait forever. They have lots of beers and the pizza is usually pretty decent. I hope that our work lunch was just a one time issue because we typically consider BJ's to be a pretty solid choice for our family.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=680

The Dude ..,"Elk Grove, CA",155,73,3,5.0,1/5/2011,"The waiting area is spacious and nice. The outdoor waiting area reminds me of a club that has a back door patio. Ambiance and feel makes it upscale. only thing that griped me was that I couldnt smoke cause someone brought their kids and was standing outside by the ash tray. On the plus side seeing children makes it feel more laid back then upscale, does this make sense? If a parent can bring their kids to a bar then the food and atmosphere is great right? We were seated at a bigger table for just me and my girlfriend. It was like winning the lottery, first in line gets the next table and we got the kings booth or something.  although we did get a few ppl near the bar staring at our table like they wanted it. It's good to be envied. The food and beer came fast. Always love it when you get your beer within 3 minutes if asking for it. Loved the artichoke dip, freshly made chips were nice and warm. And the chciken wings were huge. The pasta was fresh with nice cream and butter with out an over powering grease feel. All of the portions in the food was great. Had people staring at us wanting our table but ehhh too bad, sucks to be them. You check in at the front desk for a reason.

Scott B.,"Sacramento, CA",20,30,11,1.0,9/22/2010,"Firstly, I do love the food here.  Great pizza.  Decent prices.  Good beer selection.  But I just can't get past something very important: The service is absolutely terrible.  It ruins the experience every time I go.  I've given them at LEAST 8 shots at redeeming themselves, and they have not done so (for some reason I keep getting roped into going here because groups of family or friends end up here, to my protests).  From the second you enter the place, the hosts are ALWAYS snooty and rude, and the wait staff is short, rude, and slow, with a few exceptions.  I imagine the wait staff is terribly overworked, so I don't blame the employees themselves, per se.   Frankly, the fact that they are always busy seems to make them think they are doing something right.  Who am I to blame them for not making changes, when they are still the most popular restaurant in Elk Grove?  In reality, the Elk Grove suburbanites are just so fad-obsessed and have ZERO standards, they don't seem to care.  I can say this, because I spent the first 22 years of my life there.  I've seen all the great locally owned restaurants get put out of business by the onslaught of chain restaurants (RIP Elk Grove Brewery, Papa's Pizza, Plantation Coffee, etc).  When the next fad chain restaurant opens in Elk Grove, this place will hopefully get a severe reality check.  My favorite restaurants tend to have very overworked staff, and service isn't the best, but at least they aren't outright rude.  I can't say the same for BJ's.  I've had great experiences at other BJ's locations, but Elk Grove is the exception.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=680

Ice shavings. Salmon was like sushi. I like sushi, but not at BJ's.  Oh yeah... Our waitress dropped off our check after the appetizers - before our main course.

So it's nice when its a bigger group because then everyone can talk as loud as they want!  Dishes to Avoid:  1.   ALL BURGERS!! Even when it's slathered with sauce the meat is still very dry and tasteless 2.   Spaghetti- I believe it was something about spaghetti romano or something like that? But it's spaghetti with marinara sauce that.... literally looks like they cooked the angel hair and then popped open a can of Ragu boiled it and poured the sauce and some seasoning on top... not very appetizing....  Dishes to try:  1.  Their pizza's! I've only tried a couple of them but they're all very good! My favorite is the BBQ chicken pizza! Their pizza's are....i  guess they're called deep dish pizza's? Verrrryyyy good!! Full of flavor and everything tastes fresh! 2.  Their Cajun Pasta! I believe that's what it's called... or is it Tuscan Pasta...? Anyways its the spicy pasta. It's absolutely Delicious! The presentation of it is rather plain but the flavor of the pasta makes up for it.  3. Their salad with the tortilla chips in it... I can't remember what it was called but it was more of a mexican salad with cilantro dressing. Very tasty and fresh.  4. Bazookie! It's basically a cookie baked in a personalized little pan with a scoop of ice cream on top. it may sound simple and a little bit plain... but everyone i know is always talking about how good it is! I agree! Overall I gave it 4 stars because it always take's forever to get seating. Also even when I do to go orders it takes a while.

O M G.,"Sacramento, CA",9,1724,8466,4.0,8/10/2008,"We stopped in for lunch the other day after watching a movie and it hit the spot. We just felt like having some beer and appetizers and it was a perfect addition to our afternoon. It wasn't too busy that we had to wait for a table like many other times but sitting there, looking around.. the servers used to be a good looking group when they first opened. Looking around it went downhill, our server was intense and looked at us like she wanted to eat  us. But we laughed and thought maybe it's a lunch thing like at strip clubs where the not-so-great looking dancers work the day shift. I think it was more bearing on their looks because they all looked miserable or had very eager to please tension in their face..  Now, BJ's has an extensive menu. I think the pizookie is their niche and not to mention their own brews. My favorite being the Jerry Burst, a mix of the jeremiah red and berry burst cider. My only qualm that i've encountered thus far regarding their menu is that seasoned fries is an appetizer option and on the menu it says to choose crispy thin or wedges and we wanted cripsy thin and our server said.. the crispy thin fries are not seasoned, only the wedges are. SOOOOO... that made no sense to me to have that listed that way and irritated me a bit but that's that.

Jeff B.,"Sacramento, CA",39,8,,1.0,10/6/2013,"One out of five stars. Let me explain why. My Fiance and I arrive on a Sunday night at 7:05 pm. We were seated at around 7:20. As soon as I sat down my toes were splashed with beer from a puddle that resided under our table. That was cleaned up by the hostess - which isn't her job. A few minutes later our server came out and took our orders. We wanted a lemonade and pepsi plus our entres. Over ten minutes later our server came out and said that she was going to have another server help us and immediately walked away. We still had not received our drinks at this point. The new server came out and said she would bring out our drinks right away. By the time we had them at our table it had been 20 minutes after the initial order was placed. We both sat at our table drinking and talking until we realized that a significant portion of time had passed since we had placed our order. When the substitute waitress finally approached our table it was 8:40 pm. I kid you not. She asked ""Is everything okay?"" My fiance said, ""No. We don't have our food. So nothing is okay."" The waitress seemed shocked and said that the previous waitress, who took our order, had told her that we only wanted drinks. Hahahaha who goes to BJ's and orders a pink lemonade and pepsi? So, at this point, we became very irate. We had waited over an hour to hear that our original server had never even placed our order to begin with. Serious? At this point our back up waitress gets the manager who comes out and offers to take care of the meal. He was kind and empathetic towards us. We didn't want to wait any longer so he offered $75 in gift cards. I refused them at first but he somehow convinced us to take them and apologized profusely. He even offered to box up our meals when they were ready so that we can take them home. Again, we refused this offer as we just wanted to leave.  What should have occurred is that our original waitress placed the order like she is paid to do. I'm sure it's not a hard thing to do and I'm sure she has had plenty of training in doing so. Unfortunately, that did not happen. What should have occurred next, is the sub-waitress should have said ""Oh I apologize for the wait your food is almost ready."" Instead she said, ""I was told that all you wanted was the drinks."" By saying this she had revealed that our order was never in, and we had been forgotten by the original waitress.  I spent nearly two hours for $75 worth of gift cards that expire in two months. When we left BJ's it was 8:50 pm. I gave the gift cards to the man who worked the Taco Bell drive through in Elk Grove. I figured I would get rid of any bad karma that may have caused this terrible incident and colossal waist of my time. I hope he enjoys BJ's more than we did tonight.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=720

When we walked in the front desk person informed us she didn't know how dine in worked she needed to ask please wait in waiting area. We saw open seating in bar area so we took advantage of seating ourself. The front desk girl said she would send someone who knew how the dine in worked. We were greeted my a waitress who we informed we ordered dine in and as as well informed us she didn't get many dine in orders sat in bar area so she didn't know how it worked then asked us for drinks. A different waitress/ maybe hostess dropped of a Tab which had our dine in order on it. About 15 mins later (30 mins into waiting) a manager came by and asked for the tab (we must have looked irritated at this point). I could see him bouncing around to different POS systems and questioning a lot of the staff with our tab in hand. When he walked by with our waiter I could hear him telling her to put in a rush order. He then came to our table and informed us that our order had never been processed and he was going to give us free appetizers. He came by many times after to make sure we were taken care of and did take care of the two appetizers we had ordered through the dine in order. He was very appologetic and informed us he would be talking to his staff personally about the experience. My boyfriend hates BJ due to the fact that every location: Natomas, San Bernadino, Arden Mall And Elk Grove continuously mess up our service or order. I have to beg him to take me due to the fact I love the stuffed mushrooms and Italian dressing.

I love pizza and by no means a hardcore pizza connoisseur, but their deep dish pizza SHOULD NOT be called a deep dish pizza! First of all it did not even come in a dish! It was more of a puffy pillowy crust pizza! Take your average pizza and inflate the crust, Voila! BJ's deep dish pizza! it was even more absurd that the waiter informed us that in a ""deep dish pizza"" the tomato was on top! I should of told him that normally the sauce is on top and not a few pieces of tomato! I mean it wasn't a badtasting pizza, but it was definitely not a deep dish pizza.

Second of all, good brown beer, dumb name.  Brewnette.  It packs a good punch, tastes rich and yeasty, without bitterness.  I even tried the pairing with Santa Fe springrolls (these are pretty crispy and tasty, but the cilantro collected in my teeth, which I don't mind, but apparently my dinner partners thought it was funny.) I tried the BBQ chicken pizza.  Eh.  It's okay.  It's filling.  The pizza ""crust"" is almost a sponge, so it's different from what you might be used to.  We tried the flat appetizer pizza with tomato and basil, and that was nice and light and crackery (better than the deep dish, in my opinion.)  If you do get one, the mini is plenty for a single eater. The standouts were the beer and the flat basil/tomato pizza.   70+ bucks for 4 people, our check was 46 bucks for two people with beers, 2 appetizers and a mini pizza.  The atmosphere is a little better than Chili's and WAY better than Red Robin, while remaining ""kid friendly"".  It's not optimal for kids, but it's good for ages 4 and older (because they can eat.)

But it's also a good place to for one-on-one dates because they have a bar area with a few cozy little booths and seats at the bar with several large televisions. I like to try their different kinds of deep dish pizza (BBQ Chicken is my fav!!) They also have a vast variety of beers and ciders. I recently discovered split beers, like the Snake Bite, and they also have other combinations of half cider, half beer. I want to go back to try them all. I gave them 4 stars because I always have a good time hanging out with my friends here, or stopping by for their happy hour late at night. It's one of the very few places in EG open past midnight on the weekends. But be forewarned: it can get very crowded on certain days, so expect to spend a few hours altogether--waiting for a table, waiting for your food, slow service, etc--if you're planning to come on a weekend night. If you really don't like waiting then I suggest going somewhere else. I bumped them up half a star because they hand out free pizookies on your birthday!!!

Jared P.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,6,,5.0,7/13/2015,"I've been here twice in the last two weeks (as well as many times before) and I have to say my experience has been consistent and excellent. The only thing that ever annoys me is they don't give you a napkin and utensils when you sit down (had to ask both times). First time I went with my girlfriend. We were seated instantly near dinner time, had a very bubbly and helpful server named Adam, and had our appetizers in under 10 minutes. Same experience for when I went with my parents and brother at dinner time, really quick service. My girlfriend and I got the Avocado Egg Rolls and Sriracha Honey Brussle Sprouts, I highly recommend both. The egg rolls are like nothing you have ever had, creamy avocado slices with a southwest filling and ginger dipping sauce, it works deliciously, and a big portion. The brussle sprouts I will get everytime now, only $5, good portion, and the taste is unlike any brussle sprouts I've had, perfect. They are crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, drizzled with a sriracha honey sauce that doesn't over power either taste, nice and tangy, you need to try them. For dinner we got the Black and Bleu Burger and the Pulled Pork Sandwich. Our food was there in under 10 minutes after the appetizers, very fast. The black and blue is great, blue cheese, bacon, roma tomatoes, and roasted garlic aioli, I nearly licked my girlfriends fingers after she gave me a small bite. The pulled pork was fantastic as well, it's huge, great coleslaw, tangy bbq sauce, nice big chunks of pork and a bit of fat back, it was just juicy and filling. After all that we were freaking stuffed, and we had only been there for 30 minutes! Plenty of to go boxes. Adam was prompt all throughout the service, got us anything with a smile and was fast, he got a nice tip. I can't say anything bad about this place, it's like an upscale Cheesecake Factory, and has nearly as many items, something for everyone. The place is really cool looking too, just like a giant sports bar, but not noise or crowded feeling, very nice murals, tons of big screens, and really good low priced beers too.

Krista G.,"Elk Grove, CA",500,61,86,1.0,1/25/2016,"Tried the Curbside Pick To Go last night for dinner. First, you should never offer a service that you can't follow through on. The ONLY good thing about the experience was the online ordering. We schedule our pick up for 7:30pm. We arrived at that time and called the phone number as instructed. A girl answered and said they would be right out. 20 minutes later we called again and they said our order would be right out. 40 minutes after arriving someone finally came out. We made payment by credit card, which the server had to walk all the back into the restaurant to process. BJs can't afford mobile POS systems? The server returned with our receipt and we voiced our experience and her response was ""I'm only a Bagger."" If you're the only point of contact for a business, then your more than just a Bagger you represent the business and you should not give an excuse like that to a customer. We arrive home (we live less than 1/2 a mile away). We unpack the bag and find our order was wrong. I looked at the itemized receipt and everything we ordered was on there it just didn't make it into the bag. How hard is it to put an order together when everything is listed with the details? Seems like if your job is only a Bagger you should be excellent at it. Due to the excessive amount of time we waited, everything was cold and our ice cream was melted.

Very bland unless slathered in BBQ sauce, kind of tough and they had that precooked/reheated flavor that meat sometimes gets. Also, my very berry cider was rather weak but refreshing anyway.

Rodney B.,"Elk Grove, CA",82,38,116,2.0,5/9/2011,"Summary: The food was mostly good, the service...not so much. I've eaten at this BJ's several times since it opened. They have a delicious clam chowder and a great wedge salad.  We decided to stop here for a Mother's Day brunch and were surprised how short the wait time was.  Our party of 5 was seated pretty quickly and we ordered right away. The Service: The waitress didn't want to put in my ""spicy bloody mary"" order in with the bartender since she said ""it's comes from a mix and it already comes spicy"" (I've had spicy bloody marys there before). They were supposed to be featuring a white berry tini for May (Mother's Day) and when my wife ordered it the waitress said they were ""out"". When I asked which ingredient was out, she said ""it comes premixed, so I'm not sure. I'll ask the manager"". Later she came back and said the manager would be coming by to talk to us and that they ""found"" the ingredients to the white berry tini. The manager came by and poured the cocktail, but didn't say a word to us. I asked what happened with the berry tini and he said they were out of the monin syrup, but they just got some in.  My wife tasted the drink and it tasted like cough syrup. My meal came out with less than half the eggs it was supposed to have. I waited for about 10 minutes for the waitress to come by and check us with no luck.  I was pretty surprised by the lackadaisical attitude showed by the waitress and manager. Even when they were made aware of issues, they didn't seem to want to actually engage. Just a quick ""I don't know"" or waiting for us to ask for an update. The Food: The french toast itself was delicious. Crisp on the outside and perfectly cinnamony. My wife loved her salad and my kids ate all of the dishes they ordered (captain crunch crusted french toast sticks, macaroni and cheese, and a grilled cheese sandwich). We ordered pizookies for dessert and they were all great....except for my wife's which was overcooked and hard as a rock (instead of chewy and gooey like the description). Even then, she said the flavor of the pizookie was great, but it was just way overcooked. By the end of the meal we just had to laugh at how bad the service was and how lackadaisical our waitress (and manager) seemed. I'd probably still go back for the food but I'd order it to go to avoid the service. I think I've spoiled myself by eating at so many of the great  non-chain restaurants here in Sacramento.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=500
Christine M.,"West Sacramento, CA",0,6,1,5.0,11/7/2014,"I would like to preface this by saying: I do not typically enjoy chain restaurants.  I find them to be somewhat generic, impersonal, streamlined, corporate and I think those qualities can put a damper on a quality dining experience.  That being said, I truly enjoyed my experience at Bjs in Elk Grove. Though it was fairly busy, the host And hostesses were friendly, polite and handling the rush with great poise.  While we waited for our table we had cocktails at the bar. I've had trouble in the past being able to grab a drink while I wait for my table, problems range from unfriendly staff, too crowded areas, slow service,etc- it can be exasperating and can sometimes put a damper on the whole evening.  Luckily, this was not the case.  The bar staff was warm and friendly, though obviously busy.  The bartenders were patient and helpful While I choose a drink- I finally decided on one of the bartenders recommendations, Top Shelf Margarita, while my boyfriend had a Jeremiah Red.  Unlike other bars, we were able to be greeted, order and receive our drinks in only a few moments. While we waited in the bar area I observed the staff and servers. Many times in ""rush. Hour"" servers can be stressed and frazzled when they are attempting to juggle all the aspects of their jobs, but it really seemed that everyone was getting along, working together and taking the busy hours in stride. Also, the manager, Vanessa, seemed to be successfully involved in the entire process. It's incredibly refreshing to see a corporate restaurant manager really involved in the entire guest experience- which I think starts with backing up her front of the house people. Vanessa had caught our attention when alcohol transformed some preciously pleasant patrons into something less than desire able.The guests were unsatisfied with the  wait time for a table, and were frankly acting, in my opinion,  verbally abusive towards her as well as the staff. She expertly defused the situation and prevented further disruption to the entire restaurant.  She was calm, rational and handled what could have been an embarrassing conflict with poise and professionalism.  When we were seated our server, Nia, was pleasant and enthusiastic.  She seemed to genuinely be in good spirits, which, as I stated before, has not been my typical experience in chain restaurants.  The pizza we ordered was good; however I do prefer my pizza with plenty of sauce.  I have never tasted such a rich and delicious crust before. The manager from the incident at the bar did personally greet our table and we commended her for the way she handled the confrontation earlier, as well as how well her staff was preforming that evening.  We had (or I had!) the salted carmel pizookie for dessert and it was decadent and so worth all the calories! Though I don't frequent ""chain"" restaurants often, I truly did find my experience at Bjs to be enjoyable.  When people have a strong, dedicated manager, or leader, it reflects in almost all areas of the business.  I believe it truly is a feat to be as busy as the Bjs in Elk Grove is and to not buckle under the pressure of the ""rush.""  I believe the success can be attributed to strong leadership, as well as a talented group of people who work so well together.  With so many amazing restaurants competing for business, it's the restaurants with friendly, outgoing and genuine staff that help restaurants to stand out amongst the crowd. I apologize for the length of this review, I just believe good work should be rewarded with good feedback and Bjs Elk Grove, has made me a ""regular"" at Bjs from now on, thanks to Vanessa and her team!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=500

Robert S.,"Sacramento, CA",68,35,2,3.0,3/31/2012,"I ate here twice in the past week or two. I got the fish and chips both times. Very tasty. Unfortunately the rest of the experience was kind of disappointing. The first time I went was on a saturday night, they were incredibly busy so it took a good 10-15 minutes to be seated. Fair enough, it was a saturday night. The girl at the front desk was hardly friendly though. The food was good enough to get me to come back and try it again. I went back less than a week later to have the fish and chips . This time it was a weeknight, and somehow even though the restaurant wasn't packed like it was the on the weekend, there were plenty of problems. We weren't greeted by the girl at the front desk (a different girl from the other night) for about two minutes, while we stood there waiting. It took another few minutes after she finally acknowledge us, to be seated. She was running around trying to find seats and seating others. She told us that they only had one busser on. After we ordered and our appetizers arrived, we realized that they hand't given us silverware or napkins. So we waited for a good 5 minutes before we could get the attention of our server and ask for silverware/napkins, while our food was sitting there getting cold. Our server was not the problem. She was obviously overwhelmed and did her best to give us good service. It appeared like the place was understaffed. There was however more than one busser on, despite what we were told and you could see other tables getting impatient as well, stopping the bussers for help, for their checks, etc. The table behind us couldn't find their server either. I can say that the fish and chips, stuffed mushrooms, and crispy won tons were all very tasty. They seemed pretty understaffed and overwhelmed which didn't create a very good experience for the customer.

Oh yeah, sometimes we get lucky to get seated in less than half an hour (like yesterday, we were able to get a seat as soon as we walk in). I've had only cocktail drinks so far and they were pretty weak, but next time I'll try their beer because after all it is a brewhouse. Service is pretty decent, except that yesterday my friend was had dirty, unwashed forks that he had to take back (ewww!) I LOVE getting stuffed mushrooms and fried artichokes. Then sometimes I'll get an entree if I'm in the mood for it. As far as desserts, I like the peanut butter pizookie, but I sure LOVE the baked strawberry beignet.

Tim M.,"Sacramento, CA",53,21,,2.0,7/12/2011,I love the food here but the service licks my mud butt.  Because residents of Elk Grove have nothing better to do expect your evening trip to BJ's to be full of waiting.  Waiting for a table... waiting for a waiter... waiting for your water/beverage refill...  waiting for the check.  Why so many people flock to BJ's when there are far superior restaurants (locally owned and not chains) is beyond me.  Even on off random nights like a tuesday night you can find yourself waiting 45 minutes to an hour for a table.  If you do go I recommend the grilled chicken pasta.  If you have a sweet tooth you can never go wrong with a pazooki.  Its raw unprotected impregnable sex in a pan!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=780
Jaime F.,"Sacramento, CA",265,79,,5.0,5/17/2011,"I don't hand out five stars like I hand out BJ's (hahahhah get it?) but I can't help it in this instance since BJ's has become what I like to call my ""default place"" here in Sac.   A default place is simply that place you go to when you don't know where else to go and don't want to spend an hour Yelping to find a new place that may have wilted lettuce and a snarky gay server.  The place must have a decent beer selection, a menu big enough to please everyone in the party, have consistently tasty food and passable service.  BJ's has all of these things along with a drink menu offering a variety of over priced yet curiously tempting cocktails, such as their in-house made root beer with Captain Morgan and a dollop of whip cream.  Fuck yes.  Does it cost, like, 20 bucks to order one of these cocktails? Yes, but what do you expect?  It's a brewhouse, don't be like me and order a vodka soda at two in the afternoon.  From 11-3 you can get awesome specials on food, beer and cocktails.  Go during these hours if you don't want to spend too much.  They're also always happy to let you sample their vast beer selection.  BJ's isn't something notably special; it's not innovative or creative, it's not fusion anything, it's American fare with a million page menu and a good variety of pizzas.  Their appetizer menu, while not cohesive in any sense, is always good and offers an interesting variety.  You can get a plate of Ahi tuna set next to a plate of nachos set next to pot stickers set next to basket of chicken strips underneath a deep dish pizza.  You can get a Maui glazed pork chop (delicious) or a giant burger, a plate of pasta, a turkey club, mini tacos, a bowl of chili in a bread bowl, mac and cheese etc, etc.  Everything is decent, nothing ever sucks, and that's why this is a default place.  I often skim the reviews before I write my own and I noticed a lot of Yelpers talking shit about the service, claiming they had to wait, or their servers messed up or OMG THEY WERE OUT OF SOMETHING.  I've never had a bad experience with the service and while I have had an instance when they were out of something, I don't hold it against them because, like, they're a restaurant and have customers and sometimes whoever is doing the ordering for products in the kitchen may not know a party of 600 is going to come in and all order pork chops.  There menu has 78 pages, order a fucking pizza if you can't get your pork chop and try not to cry about it.  A default place is important, it's a necessary staple when you enjoy dining out and a simple solution when no one can agree or nobody knows what they want. That is why BJ's gets five stars.  They've delivered a service that other restaurants in town can't do.  They've facilitated an easy out, a chance to avoid disagreement and complication by saying, ""lets just go to BJ's.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=780

The spaghetti is usually always good though. I think the service really depends on if you're eating with a party or not. When I eat here with my bf, the waiters are usually attentive and friendly. When I eat here with parties...whole different story. It's like the larger the party the crappier the service, but what can I say? Most restaurants are like that I guess.

Mike L.,"Sacramento, CA",153,94,51,3.0,4/1/2013,"Quick hint:  If you want better service, sit at the bar area.  Not only do you get happy hour discounts, but the service is waaaaaaaaaaay better.  I can't say that all the service down in regular seating is all bad, but I've had at least 3 times where the service was incredibly horrible.  Two of those times, I saw people seated after my table, get service and food and pay their bill before mine even received our food (same server).  I'm really not one to complain either as this is a pretty busy establishment, but on those two occasions I had to say something and in the nicest way possible.  The managers handled the situations professionally and offered appetizers, desserts and even cut the bill in half, which was really nice of them, and another reason why I come back.  But it really shouldn't happen this many times.  I love the food here and their beers are pretty good also, just the service makes me second guess coming, well actually, I pretty much only sit at the bar seating only now.  So if I had to rate the food, it'd be 4 stars.  The bar service is 5 stars.  The regular seating service 2 stars, it averages out to about 3.5 (I know I'm Asian, but I pretty much suck at math).  I come back for the food and beer (happy hour).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=780

The spinach stuffed mushrooms are delicious. I would normally order those for appetizers, as well as the seared ahi bites. My favorites are the classic ribeye steak and the baby back pork ribs. Both are outstanding, even though they may be a bit pricey. I've also had their BJ's Favorite Pizza, which is wonderful. And can't forget their chocolate chip pizookie. Those are amazing.

They do supply a lot of parking, only thing is that you'll work up an appetite just trying to walk back to the restuarant. Service is generally good. The food is decent, nothing I would call extraordinary. I think what makes this place special is all the beers they have on tap. My first time there, I asked the waitress what beer would go well with my dish and she ended up brining this guy who asked my a whole bunch of questions about my beer preferences. They eventually brought me 3 different types of beer to sample (they were all pretty good) and the one I ended up picking did go well with my food. I am sorry for not remembering the name. Mind you, they could of just said ""Bud light"" and I would've been fine drinking that with my food.  But that was an interesting experience, something I was not expecting. Would I recommend?

Lynsey C.,"San Francisco, CA",294,117,,4.0,1/12/2009,"Normally I'm not a fan of  big chain restaurants, but BJ's blows all those feelings away (no overly sexual pun intended).  My roommates used to drag me to the San Jose location when I lived in Campbell. I never really got excited about it but it was next to the movie theater and they had delicious beer so I let it happen. I went to this Elk Grove location with my dad over the weekend to grab a quick lunch and watch part of the Charger game. We sat at the bar and ordered up drinks. My dad had a bloody mary and I enjoyed one of their Hefewizen's. His mary was delicious and spicy, he practically drank it one gulp he loved it so much. My beer was ice cold and served with a smile. We scored seats right in front of their gigantic flat screen which was AWESOME for watching the game. My dad ordered the Italian Chop Salad and it was huge! He couldn't even finish it and my dad is a big dude (6'7"") ! I decided to switch it up and NOT go with what they are famous for (chicago style pizza). I ordered their wedge salad and mahi mahi tacos. The salad was fresh and crisp. The tacos were delightfully tasty and sweet. I would have liked more spice, but I always say that. I was kind of bummed that the guacamole/avocado sauce (not sure which it was) appeared to be poured out of a bottle.

Steve E.,"Elk Grove, CA",9,87,,3.0,9/1/2009,"Let's begin this review by correcting a misnomer.  While the BJ's chain uses the word ""Brewhouse"" in their name, they do their actual brewing in separate breweries, not in their restaurants.  Given all the big-screen TVs tuned to 24-hour sports channels on the walls, a more accurate name would be ""Restaurant/Sports Bar.""  Now on to the Elk Grove BJ's. AMBIANCE:  If I had to give it a name, I would call BJ's décor Industrial Revolution Moderne, featuring exposed A/C ducting overhead, large Leninesque murals of the type that depict the workingman's struggle against capitalistic oppression, and neo-impressionistic art filling the gaps in the walls between the murals and big-screen TVs.  I can't say what sort of mood BJ's decorators were trying to achieve with this style, but I did feel an overwhelming urge to shout ""Do dna"" every time I picked up my glass.  I will give the designers credit, however, for utilizing enough sound deadening to lower the typical sports bar rowdiness to a mild roar so it's possible to carry on a normal conversation at your table. FOOD:  BJ's menu is substantial, and once you get past five pages of beer, wine and cocktail options, plus two pages of appetizers, your lunch/dinner choices run the gamut from relatively healthy (veggie dishes, salads and the promise of a gluten-free menu in the future) to such an overwhelming selection of calorie-laden, cholesterol-infused dishes that you can feel your arteries hardening just reading the choices. Variety abounds among the selections of appetizers, deep-dish pizzas, burgers, sandwiches, and specialties.  There's something here that just about everyone will enjoy.  And the food is good--without exception, everything I've eaten at the Elk Grove BJ's has been tasty.  Try the Texas-Style Chicken Fried Steak (under Brewhouse Favorites) with white cheddar mashed potatoes.  It might do you in, but you'll die happy! For a chain, the level of preparation and the quality of ingredients are surprisingly high.  Prices are also on the high side, but given the food quality and hearty portions, most will agree that BJ's offers fair value for your dollars. SERVICE:  The quality of service at BJ's is similar to their menu--there is a lot of variety.  As with most chains, there seems to be inconsistency in the way corporate training and service criteria are observed.  You may get good service or you may have to remind your server several times to refill your water glass or bring a needed condiment.  Given the pretty decent chow BJ's serves up, a little more emphasis on efficient, friendly service would earn them a four-star rating. Be aware that the Elk Grove BJ's is a popular joint, so timing is everything.  For lunch, show up by 11:30 a.m. or be prepared for a wait.  For dinner...well, just be prepared for a wait. TIP:  Guys, if you take a date to BJ's, don't let all those flickering big-screen TVs distract you.  Women are seldom flattered when you appear more interested in the MLB highlights than you are in them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=780

So you stuck a plate of perfectly seared tuna in front of my face along with a pile of mixed baby greens, Napa cabbage, red bell peppers, tomatoes, avocado, and pickled cucumber.  You tossed it with rice wine vinaigrette and topped it with crispy wontons and green onions.  You even put a small dollop of wasabi in each corner of my plate.  Was that supposed to persuade me into thinking your salads are something more than mediocre? You provided excellent attentive waitresses that took great care of us.  I suppose you thought we should be impressed and that would persuade us into thinking you are something more than mediocre as well?

David L.,"Sacramento, CA",3,15,,2.0,8/11/2008,"Every single day I pretty much drive pass BJ's and I see so much people here and wonder ""Why?"" I've been to BJ's twice now and my first impression of the place was that it has a nice interior and that was it. I first came here with my folks when it was their grand opening. Ordered and waited for something that wasn't worth waiting. The food was distasteful for all of us, it wasn't anything unusual it was just not delightful for our tasting.  So it has been around 2 years since I've last visited BJ's and since my last visit was during their grand opening I've thought maybe they caught on to their distasteful food and decided to change chefs or at least their recipes. So I'm back here at BJ's now, this time for my friends 21st birthday. All of us just started to enjoy the night, drinking ourselves to happiness. Then we ordered some food, I ordered the California grilled chicken sandwich. When our food finally arrived the waitress yells out ""California burger!"" and not realizing it that was my order. So I had to chase her back for the California grilled chicken sandwich and not the ""California burger"".  When I took a bite out of my sandwich I almost gaged, not because of the effect of the alcohol because I know I didn't drank much. Wow! nightmares just came and haunted me from the first time I was here, I think I'm scarred for life. Don't come to BJ's expecting good food, it is a brewery restaurant so I was wrong to judge their food when I should be looking at their drinks. ~Forget what you heard, want to go somewhere good?

Our food came sporadically but they were hot and presented well.  HOWEVER, after getting about 1/8th through my Jambalaya, I chewed on something hard and when I took it out of my mouth, I freaked out and almost threw up because it looked like a piece of someone's acrylic nail!!!  To my dismay, I had to inform our waitress and she summoned the manager right away. The manager took my plate and came back a few minutes later to inform me that it wasn't someone's nail - thank God b/c if it was, w/ my OCD, I would've stuck my finger down my throat and gargled with clorox for days! It was however, a piece of those plastic ties and still unacceptable.  He offered me another plate and would make sure he'd put a rush on it.

TRACY R.,"Sacramento, CA",585,679,856,1.0,8/2/2010,"Every time I venture out of Sacramento down town to eat in Elk Grove; why am I always horribly disappointed? BJ's Restaurant on a Sunday was fairly busy (probably because it's one of the only decent restaurants/bars in that area). I met up with a girl friend to catch up over a couple of drinks since she lives in that area. It's a good thing I didn't try to have a proper dinner, because people were outside waiting for a table just to be seated. We waited near the bar until a patron left and quickly took their seats. We ordered two Salty Dogs, which just tasted watered down, so minus one star. We ordered chicken wings and sausage flat bread to share. The chicken wings were pretty tasty. It came with a sweet and sour sauce and ranch sauce. We ran out of both sauces and tried to flag down the waitress for a refill, which she never returned with, so minus another star. The flat bread was pretty good as well; with a great balance of cheese and sausage. The ambiance of the place was ghetto; so minus another star. There definitely wasn't a diverse type of crowd that down town attracts. Imagine going to a family restaurant where all you see are males age 25-35 dressed like rappers wearing baggy pants, baseball caps, tennis shoes (Air Force Ones or Jordan's), and either a white t shirt or jersey. If you're not a rapper, then dress your age!!! Definitely NOT the place to go if you're looking for single males. Plus, they probably have bay bay kids with one or two baby mamas. I give this place only one star since the only good thing about it was the chicken wings and the flat bread. But everything else was whack!

R K.,"Sacramento, CA",14,17,,1.0,5/30/2013,"We returned to eat here last night and we were not pleased.  I used to love the pizza here - I had imagined the cooks in the back preparing a pizza from scratch each time, because they tasted so good.  Last night the magic was gone and we even decided not to return in the near future.   We each ordered Caesar salads which were good.  I ordered the Tatonka Stout, which was as good as I remembered.  Then the pizza came out.  It was cold!  I mean the cheese wasn't even melted cold.  I mean cold to the touch cold.  We called the first server we saw and she apologized and took it away to be heated more.  It came out again - it was luke warm.  Usually when I had pizza here the slices were too hot to touch.  I always had to use a knife and fork to eat the first slice, that's how hot it used to be.  But even after the pizza came out the second time I could grab the first slice with my hands and take a bite without having hot melted cheese heat up your mouth -  it was like it had been sitting out for half an hour.  I don't know how they make their pizzas here, I guess they are pre-made and frozen and then thrown in a blast oven or something.  But last night they couldn't get it right.   We complained again and the manager came out, apologized and asked what we wanted.  We said we wanted a new pizza because getting the same pizza reheated three times would dry it out.  She agreed and we waited for another pizza. The new pizza was weird.  It was luke warm in the middle and steaming hot around the crusts. We decided the food preparers (I won't even call them cooks) didn't know what they were doing.  So we just ate a couple slices each and took the rest to go.     Though the manager checked on us, we felt she was a little abrubt and uncaring.  We paid full price for the lousy experience.  I have been to places where a manager will a least give you a free drink when they screw up - and they screwed up badly here - but not last night.  We tipped the waitress a good tip because she was attentive and the lousy pizza was not her fault.  The salads were okay, and the Tatonka Stout was devine.  But we aren't going back, at least not for a long time.  If I want to reheat a frozen pizza I can do that at home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=660

Faye V.,"San Francisco, CA",47,59,52,4.0,1/10/2012,"My restaurant nightmare is sending food back to the kitchen. True story. I am extremely afraid of getting pubic-hair-pizza or spit-back-spaghetti. I have never ever returned food to the kitchen - no matter how badly -- at least until we were served an overcooked steak at BJ's. The twist? It was because of this overcooked steak that BJ's at Elk Grove made me a fan. It was actually my mother's order. The scene: It's the week before Christmas, we hit up BJ's after a shopping marathon, all starved. Drinks and appetizers came, followed by the main dishes. Everyone dove into their plates like vultures. But, as famished as mamskii was, she wasn't touching it.  She was so turned off, she just pushed her plate aside. Luckily for us, the server noticed her dissatisfaction and was extremely kind about everything. Furthermore, the manager himself came over to remedy the situation. Within 20 minutes, a brand new steak arrived, cooked perfectly at medium well - served with a baked potato and all the fixings. Their overall method of the handling everything impressed us all. The staff was very courteous and the manager's extra effort did not go unnoticed. Although it was my nightmare come true, my fears waned - a little. We've eaten here before and everything has always been a-okay. The food is decent, the servers efficient and the atmosphere perfect for a group of 10 equipped with two toddlers and a man-child. Our cups never went empty, our meals always served timely. Most importantly, because it's a chain, the menu is reliable. Spit-back spaghetti is still a fear - regardless of where I eat. However, if you want a laid back joint to enjoy a few beers with friends or have dinner with the family, BJ's at Elk Grove is a good option. Our fave appetizers are the wings, nachos, calamari and bruschetta. The pizza and pastas have never gone wrong and the fish dishes are a nice surprise. If you have room for dessert - that pizookie is pretty darn delish. I believe that others may not have gotten the same service - but I'm glad we've been lucky.

Why you might inquire: Drink order mistake #1: wrong drink but could not remember what I ordered anyway. Drink order mistake #2: hot tea but no cup to put it in. Salad: forgot any dressing whatsoever. Entree: wife finished hers before I even got mine. Entree: way too long under the heat lamp and dried out my food.

Eric T.,"Elk Grove, CA",454,4,,2.0,4/6/2011,"I've gone to this BJs since its opened, and the only reason I've been going there is for their food and larger space for parties. We all know the food quality and menu, since it is a larger chain of restaurant, so there isn't much to change there from the other BJ's.  Biggest critique I have for this place is their staff. I have been there at different times of the day (lunch, dinner, happy hour) and I have never had an above par experience. Whether it be feeling rushed, messing up on an order, messing up on a receipt / ring up, or being spilled on, it always seems like something goes wrong. And I'm not the type of person to look for the flaws it just seems like there isn't a high standard there.

The guys killed their sandwiches, while I only finished half of mine and couldn't eat anymore, but the food was awesome.  Our waiter totally sucked though. He kept forgetting our lemons for the beer, forgot to give the brother's ID back to him (since he was out of state, they had to take it for verification), and forgot to bring him his beer.

Amy T.,"Houston, TX",973,503,162,4.0,1/7/2009,"This is the only BJ's I have ever been to. I have been here several times and my experiences have been good and bad.  I came here last night because we were in the mood for pizza and other foods. My boyfriend had the small mediterranean pizza which was very tasty! The small size is also a large portion of food, probably enough for two small appetites. At the price of $14.95 it was well worth it. I ordered Derek's Favorite Meatloaf Sandwich. It was meatloaf on top of buttered toast and mashed potatoes on top of all of that. It was the perfect combination! The dish also came with vegetables. The meatloaf sandwich was less than $9. The food is usually good other than pasta! I have had the pasta here and it was dry and the chicken pasta comes with overly grilled burnt chicken! I had to send back the chicken before because it was too burnt to eat. My only complaint regarding the food would be the dry pasta, other than that, everything is satisfying.  The famous BJ's pizookies are truly to die for! My personal favorite is the apple crisp with vanilla ice cream. My boyfriend and I love it and are always able to finish it all because it is just THAT good! The combination of the warm apple crisp and the vanilla ice cream is perfect. At the price of $5.50 it was definitely worth every penny.  BJ's is an affordable place to eat. They usually have a great deal of specials. They have lunch specials that cost less than $9. Also, at certain times their mini pizzas only cost $5.  The reason I gave this place 4 stars is because the service is not always outstanding. Some servers fail to acknowledge you as a paying customer and neglect you completely. It doesn't hurt to smile to the people that you are serving.  I am definitely a fan of this location and will continue to be a returning costumer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=660

The beers are pretty standard with nothing really jumping out at me.  I'll go between the Red and the Nut Brown for the usual beers and have enjoyed some of their seasonal styles.  We just went and they had some pumpkin beer but I'm always afraid of that because most that I've found use pumpkin flavoring at the end, not actual pumpkin in the brewing process.  I haven't had a good pumpkin ale - perhaps this might have been the first, but I wasn't about to try. The pizza is good quality and a decent take on Chicago-style pizza.  The crust is tasty and airy and the toppings are plentiful.  The proportions of the pizza (crust/sauce/cheese/toppings) is great.  For a chain I think BJ's is right up there with Old Chicago. Usually my wife and I will get the Texas BBQ Chicken Chop Salad.  This thing is massive and big enough that we both make a comfortable meal out of it.  We get the dressing on the side b/c my wife feels that they over-do the dressing but it doesn't bother me (I like the dressing/BBQ sauce combo).  I also enjoy the chop salad b/c I find them to be easier to get bite of everything each time w/out having to stab around a salad. I have ordered the fish 'n' chips here and have mixed feelings.  When I ordered it I ordered with the potato wedge fries which were seasoned.  I do enjoy the wedge fries and the seasoning but I'll have to get the chips next time to see how they rate.  As for the fish the pieces were decent sized however I didn't like how the breading was crunchy on the outside and mushy on the inside.  Because of this, the breading was falling off between bites (sliding off the fish).  The outside again held up well to the malt vinegar, but the mushy inside killed it for me. Overall I really like BJ's and we do go there quite a bit for the salad, pizza and beer.  OH!  And the pizookie - oh yea, that's awesome as well.  I can't tell you which I prefer because I love them all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=880

Alison W.,"San Jose, CA",413,1590,952,4.0,6/2/2009,"Headed here after a disappointing start to the night at Mandangos. It was a little after midnight so only the bar area was open. And all the tables were full so we had to wait a bit for one to open up. Finally the four of us squeezed around a table probably meant for two. It was dirty and someone promised to come wipe it down but it ended up staying unclean through the whole meal. Our waited was awesome though - I'm sorry I didn't get his name though - he was upbeat, funny, straightforward (no BS) and recommended this beer concoction that he said all the BJs workers loved. I don't remember what was in it - two different types of beer and one of was this berry flavored one so it was kinda sweet, which is perfect for me - the usually non-beer drinker. Anyways we ordered the appetizer sampler, chicken wings, and a chocolate chip pizookie. I have to get the pizookie every time I'm at BJs. I'm a baker myself and I know they can be made at home cause it's basically a giant cookie topped with ice cream but they must put a little something extra in it cause it's just so much more delicious. The food was average - nothing spectacular. My friends and I stayed till they turned the lights on and they kicked us out. I'm glad we ended the night on a high note.

I'm baffled that they are still open.  the food was awful & it had clearly sat for a long time before it was brought to us. Dinner was not kinda warm it was cold. I tried to play it safe and ordered the fish and chips, they had no seasoning completely bland.  Long john silvers is much better, and the potato wedges that came with the fish I'm certain came off a plate left over from the lunch run. You know how fried potatos get after sitting for awhile - that tasteless yuk.. There you go. We also tried the special sodas which they make. Sadly they even messed those up. The sodas came w/no ice just a frosted mug i'm still wondereing if this was intentional or an oversight. But the sodas are pretty strong (root beer, black cherry) and they needed to the ice to cut it, plus they werent cold! The waiters were very sweet but obviously had no wait training, reaching around us awkwardly, over our heads, and forgot to bring the utensils. It was so bad it was like being on Punked! We waited 30 minutes for the check and my 78 yr old dad started ranting about leaving w/o paying because they would never notice. The worst dinner experience I've had in a long time.

Jay K.,"Elk Grove, CA",153,472,4,5.0,7/10/2010,"BJs is a corporate restaurant paradise. They have gotten just about everything right for a chain restaurant and it shows. On any given night there will be at least a 10 minute wait to be seated at a table. This is why I usually choose to go to the bar, where the full menu is still available. Their technique for selecting and hiring service staff is near flawless. I cannot recall ever having a bad service experience here. As far as the food goes, there is not a loser on the menu. From salads to pizzas (half off at happy hour) to entree dishes and sandwiches there is nothing that you won't drool over. This is a restaurant where you will never have to be afraid to try something new. Feel free to ask for modifications too, they will be done with no attitude whatsoever. Drinks are pretty standard for a corporate restaurant but we usually get hooked up pretty good. (remember to tip people!)

Mike A.,"Sacramento, CA",0,6,,1.0,1/16/2010,"Wow... horrible experience w/ customer service. When we walked in at around 10:30 on a Thursday night, there didn't seem to be a host because we were standing around looking for somebody to help us for a good 10 minutes. There seemed to be a lot of people working, but we didn't seem to catch anybody's attention other than the patrons already there. Finally, a person who was already sitting down pointed out to their waitress that  we'd been at the front waiting for somebody for a long time. When the waitress came over she just said ""it's self-seating hours only right now."" uh... like I was supposed to know? So we walked into the ""self-seating"" area where we waited another good 30 minutes before a different server finally came around to give us menus. When we tried to order, she said that they only had appetizers and mini-pizzas after 11:00. Well, if i had gotten sat and given menus 40 minutes earlier like I was supposed to have, I would've been able to order what I wanted. The server went to check with a manager if I could still order a large pizza. The answer was ""no."" When the manager came to talk to us about it, he talked to us with apologetic words, but had an attitude clearly showing that he didn't care. I couldn't order a large pizza but I could order the mini-pizzas. How does that make sense? Doesn't this place close at 12:00 anyways? Whatever. The service was consistently  horrible and although the food was decent, (got a few mini-pizzas) everybodys' night was ruined. I usually write good reviews, but the horrible service was unacceptable to the point that I had to rant here... Anyways, maybe I'll try this place again in the future, but it wont be for a while.

Being in elk grove u are limited to places to go for drinks at night ( either bj's, friday's, applebee's or bull wings) and this is probably the place my friends and I like to go to best. So the happy hour deal is half off mini pizzas, $2 off appetizers and $1 off drinks and pints.  The best deal is for the mini pizzas so sometimes I come here just for that! It may seem small ( 5""ish) but being deep dish, it is pretty fulfilling! My favorite is the BBQ chicken which comes with chicken, cilantro, red onions and a wonderful BBQ sauce. Mmmm! Don't forget to get red chili flakes and Parmesan to finish off the pizza!  The appetizers are ok, I've probably tried all of them from the numerous amount of times I've been there. A good thing about bj's is that they change their menu every so often (3 months or so..) so it doesn't get TOO boring. I like the buffalo wings (xtra celery please!) and the artichoke dip. The avocado eggrolls are yummy because they come with this great, sweet honey-like dipping sauce. I rarely eat their actual entrees here but I have had the Cajun pasta and I must say it is pretty tasty with just the right amount of kick to it! Lastly, you can't forget the pazookie! My favorite is the original chocolate chip pazookie but they have a couple different ones now (white chocolate chip, chocolate cookie with chocolate chip and red velvet). Red velvet?!! I think this is the latest addition so my friends and I had to try it! Tried it and Eh.... Not good! The cookie was super super thin to the point where it feels like we were working extra hard trying to scrape the cookie off the bottom while the ice cream was melting away on us. Not ordering that again. For drinks you should try the Jerryburst! It is my favorite drink there which is a mixture of their berry burst cider plus their Jeremiah red. I was introduced to this a couple months ago by my friend and ever since then I havent ordered anything else!

Many of the breakfast places had a wait time of half hour minimum so on another lark, I thought maybe good time to check out BJ's and see what their breakfast is all about. My first observation was how empty the parking lot was so I was pumped that - yay - it's all good now.  The entire experience was disjointed. It took ten minutes to take our order and another ten minutes just to have the juice served &  HALF hour for the breakfast to be served. The gal delivering just plopped the plates on the table and didn't ask if any thing else might be needed.  The potatoes were ""mushy"" and I heard the couple in booth behind us comment that their potatoes were served ""cold"".  Come payment time, I also asked to speak with the manager, who I believe name was Lee.  I had observed earlier that he was momentarily checking the sport that was on the tv, which normally wouldn't have caught my attention.  However, I would be darn sure my patrons were being accommodated b4 ever taking that step. Remember, the place was not busy so it would have taken just moments to do a quik sweep to see how the customers were doing.  As I told him about our disappointment in the various aspects, and even mentioned, overhearing the folks in booth behind us expressing their dissatisfaction, I thought for sure that would have prompted him to take a few steps and just act as if he was checking on his own how they were doing.  That didn't occur.  That really made me question his interest  in the customers.  I am a patron of BJ's other times of the day, but breakfast will not occur again, ever.  With an overall 3 star review of this location, it causes me to question whether the management is monitoring the YELP reviews or any other avenue of reviews.  I think that would be time well worth spent!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=800

The kids of all ages enjoyed the cookie pizza piled high with ice cream.   We requested a mix of different flavors and they gladly obliged.      Service was good and high chairs were brought out immediately when we were seated.  We were a fairly large party and the hostess came right out with a time limit to linger after we were ready for the bill.  Although she was rightly motivated to seat those waiting, it seemed a bit rude to push us out.

It looked like she had picked up someone's leftovers and brought it to me.  She came back with the correct soup and when I asked her where the silverware was she had a blank stare and said oh you wanted silverware????????

Gayle P.,"Winter Park, FL",8,30,,3.0,11/4/2011,"Ok, here goes... First, go early or on off- peak times to any BJs. The wait time is awful during ""normal"" dining hours. Most of the staff is very accommodating. I've been visiting this chain for a while and some of my favorite entrees are no longer on the menu. If you ask nicely, they'll make it for you anyway. As another reviewer commented, the service is hit and miss. The hospitality industry tends to have a high turn-over rate, and many great servers move on to other opportunities. For the time being, beg to sit in Christine's section. She is very upbeat, without being annoyingly chipper. She is very efficient, anticipates your needs, offers suggestions based on past orders, and remembers your name. DO NOT recommend Sean!!! Curt, short, assuming, smart-aleck who forgets you're there as soon as he drops the check. Marlon's also nice...easy on the eyes and knows the ropes.  All in all, decent place.

BUT....what really makes it stand out amongst the other restaurant chains is their Berry Cider Beer.  Sigh, I quote from Will Ferrell from Old School, ""Fill it up again! Fill it up again! Once it hits your lips, it's so good!!!!"" =)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=840
Amanda H.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",122,154,13,4.0,5/24/2007,"Despite the unfortunate name (ahem), BJ's delivers flavorful food with a few twists here and there...like gigantic 30 oz stuffed potatoes that serve as meals. Do not lump BJ's into the category of yuppie suburban restaurants like Chili's, Applebee's and TJIFriday's. BJ's shows some creativity in their menu.  The Sesame Chicken Salad was fabulous - a definite repeat. Slices of quality chicken smiled at me from their bed of napa cabbage and spinach.  These flavorful leaves were garnished with sliced almonds, mandarin orange segments and dozens of wonton crisps. Be sure and ask for the dressing on the side - they brought me two cups of it and I didn't even use one.  You know the one indecisive person in the group who keeps asking the server questions or for more time to decide? I am so that girl. And for those of you like me, consider yourself warned: the menu is huge. Not as big as The Cheesecake Factory's, but still substantial. It doesn't have many pictures, and, perhaps it's juvenile of me, but that's often how I make my choices on my first visit to a restaurant. Check out the website before going - there are more pictures to help other indicisive people who struggle with large menus. Some specifics: Root Beer If you love root beer, you should give BJ's version a try. It's not so sweet as commercial root beers, and there's less carbonation so it's smoother. My friend said the Iced Tea was really gross - like sugar water, but I didn't try it.  Pasta The pasta is decent, but you can have pasta just about anywhere; I suggest trying something BJ's is better known for like their deep dish pizzas, stuffed potatoes, sandwiches, etc. Dessert I thought the Pizookie dessert (warm deep dish cookie with ice cream on top) was a little over-hyped, but it's still delicious. A great item to split.  Explaining the rating: Minus one-half star for service. Our server was very nice - when we saw her - but otherwise, incompetent.  My root beer AND water were never filled during my meal, and she didn't come by for me to ask her for more until she dropped the check. :(  Minus other half of star for lack of parking (I was forced into the Daphne's lot) and general circus-like feeling in the restaurant. This is not a ""relaxing"" place to go. It's packed. All the time. :P Double charged? Don't Panic: When my friend got home she noticed the restaurant had charged her bank card twice. She called up and talked to a manager, but he said that it's part of their system and that the second charge would go away (something to do with how they run the tip?) and it did. Just wanted to give the warning and hopefully save future BJ's diners some stress.

Davis T.,"Sacramento, CA",28,104,8,4.0,9/12/2006,"I first tried this place on my birthday and I got a free Pizookie dessert thing of theirs. It was bascially a big chocolate chip cookie in a deep pan, topped with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, choice of chocolate, white chocolate, caramel, and a cherry. It was bomb!  The only food that I have tried so far here is the pizzas. Their bbq chicken pizza, and their great white pizzas. A Medium BBQ Chicken ($15) is HUGE and is good for four people. I tried their Great White during lunch ($7) , a small personal size but was still filling for me.  I tried their seasonal brew which was some blend of an Indian ale and one of their brews. It was smooth, a little bitter, and left a little woodsy to no aftertaste afterwards. I also tried their Berry Cider which was actually beer!!! It was so good and was almost like a light juice. I could definately drink a pitcher of that.  Service was slow because they were switching shifts but I unexpectedly was later served of by a friend back from high school, no idea that he worked there. It is just weird for me to tip a friend.  I would return here again and try their other brews and something else besides pizzas. I left here happy and full with a lighter wallet.

Valerie C.,"Sacramento, CA",89,26,,4.0,6/9/2008,"This may end up being a long review... Well BJ's has a very fun atmosphere for dining, and working.  I worked at a BJ's in Vacaville for a year.  I really love the menu (it's a big menu, too).  Every time I have eaten at a BJ's I have a hard time deciding what to order, since there are so many dishes I crave. They fairly recently added a sampler-type appetizer to their menu, which I think was a good move.  I've tried every appetizer they offer and have not been disappointed by any of them.  Their appetizer menu is large, taking up two whole pages, and ranges from spicy chicken wings to thin crust pizza to lettuce wraps to... well you get the picture. The rest of the menu has so many items, I'll just categorize them:  delicious sandwiches, big tasty salads, scrumptious pastas, giant stuffed potatoes (truly giant), down-home foods, steak and ribs, and pizza. There aren't quite as many dessert choices, but the pizookies are very satisfying.  A pizookie is ""pizza"" + ""cookie"" and for every one they sell, BJ's donates $0.25 to a MS research fund for children (I think it was for MS I may be wrong). Now let's talk about the service.  Here is where I let out a long sigh.  BJ's has such potential to be one of the best restaurants ever (in my opinion), however there are so many problems with the service. Having worked for this restaurant chain/franchise/whatever, I understand how difficult it can be to provide great, or even ok, service to guests.  BJ's tends to put a lot of responsibility on its servers (instead of hiring more people) and it ends up affecting how well they can take care of the guests.  Sometimes you get a server with a bad attitude, but that seemed to be rare - they filter those types of people out pretty well, and everybody I knew that worked with me had a great attitude and did their best. That being said, I'm not going to go into more detail here about what makes it so hard to give great service in these restaurants (feel free to message me if you'd like to talk about it).   Just note that if you come to eat at a BJ's restaurant, there's a chance you will wait longer for your drinks and/or food than at another restaurant, but for me, the food is so fantastic (and I am sympathetic to the servers) that I don't mind the wait too much.   A good alternative is to get a seat at the bar - it's right next to the kitchen and the food comes out as soon as it's ready.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=840

She goes ""oh, they're not all here yet"" looking confused because our reservation was at 8pm and if my party haven't been sat yet I would've see them sitting in the lobby or outside. But just to make sure I asked her again ""so you haven't sat them yet?"" Then she goes ""I JUST TOLD YOU, THEY'RE NOT ALL HERE YET"" with an attitude! In that exact word and in a rude demeanor. I'm like okay, super annoyed, I just started to walk outside to look for my party. Before I got to the door a different host came from behind and asked if I'm part of Josh's party. I told her yes. She said I already sat your party. Wow. Not only was the first host rude but she didn't know what shes talking about. I get it, people makes mistake, it was a miscommunication which I totally understand, but her attitude is what did it for me.         Btw miss Rude was tall, light skin, wavy, curly hair and was sitting people all night.

Every time we've come to this location the service has been mediocre to poor. We usually don't dine at peek hours either. Today we came right after the lunch rush was over and before the dinner crowd. Maybe 60 people total in the restaurant. Our waitress Nadine started out promising. After she took our orders that was the last we saw of her until she brought the check. She never checked on our drinks or checked on us at all. When she brought the check she forgot to deduct the coupon I had told her about prior. (Which is ok) but that took another 10 mins before she got back to us. I even asked for a refill on my daughters drink and she forgot. I had to go up to the front desk where Morgan I believe had outstanding customer service. She offered us drinks to go and went to talk my husband about the bill. Also the table next to us had to wait a good amount of time before a server showed up.

I ordered a baked potato with the works and they forgot the works and gave me just a baked potato. Then when I went in to slice the steak I requested medium and it was over cooked and dry as hell! They forgot my fries too and the Brussels sprouts were rubbery and not crispy! I know my husband probably should of double checked the bag to see if everything was there but why should we? We didn't even bother to go back and complain. Sadly, I threw away the food and went to Leatherby's across the street... SO.MUCH.BETTER!!!

So as I agreed to give it another chance we walk in and there is no wait, I ask the hostess if we may have a booth he says give him a min. So I sat on the waiting bench, another party walks in he calls us both up at the same time he gives menus to the manager as he proceeds to walk us to a table section when I remind him I requested a booth, he says oh. As we walk to a booth section there was the other party sitting in our booth. He then seats us in a dirty booth which needs to be wiped down still. At this point I'm ready to go because it's all bad already from the jump but I say I'll give it a chance and wait til it got wiped down. I then go to sit down and the boot seat is just all broken, there is no reason a franchise like this should have broken booths. I then tell my wife I'm done I don't want to come here anymore and that she can eat here with out me anytime and I wouldn't be butt hurt.

Crystal T.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,4,,1.0,7/19/2017,By far one of the worst experiences I have ever had in a restaurant. It took 10 minutes to be greeted and another 10 for our waters. We ordered pizza and salmon. We had to ask for silverware and pre-drops.  My boyfriend ordered a side of brussel sprouts with his salmon and he was charged the appetizer price. Our food was cold but since at this point we had been there an hour we didn't want to say anything. Our server tried to make up for our terrible experience with a free dessert. Wasn't worth the 25 minute wait. It was cold and hard. It wasn't even just our server that was less than stellar but every other server who was working. 7 servers walked by our table with plates stacked up and plates on other tables without cleaning them up. They clearly had their sections and that's all the cared about. I work in a restaurant and attitudes like that is a big reason why we probably had a less than enjoyable experience.

Now it is quite normal to have an order messed up and be told incorrect wait times. It's seems like a lack of leadership, proper training and experience are to blame. The last time we visited, my sister ordered a vegetarian version of a chicken sandwich. My sister does not eat meat at all, but she was almost finished with the sandwich when she realized they did not take the bacon off the sandwich. We told the manager (Vanessa) about the mishap. We were not looking for the item to be taken off the bill, since the majority of it was eaten, but what would have been sufficient is a simple apology.

Service here is so-so.  I've had servers who were friendly and quirky, then servers who were rude and didn't even care.  I guess they didn't want the tip that badly.  They don't do separate checks, but you can pay with multiple cards as long as you indicate which is which.  The kitchen is closed around midnight, which would have been nice if the server had told us because it was a friend's birthday, and he didn't get his complimentary pizookie!!  You know how we like our free stuff, especially when it comes to food!! Anyway, I like to order the Angle Hair Toscana pasta with shrimp.  The portion is HUGE and it comes with two pieces of garlic bread (yummy).  If you go during lunch hour, I'd recommend to order the ""half-order"".  The Grilled Chicken Potato (part of their ""Giant Stuffed Potatoes) is pretty good also.  There's plenty of potato, chicken and the jack cheese is perfectly melted.  I tried the Chicken BBQ pizza and was not a fan, partially because I didn't like the taste of BBQ sauce on my pizza.  The Great White however was pretty good.  The ahi poke is a great appetizer.  The seasoning on the chips fulfills the flavor of this dish.  And of course, don't skip out on a pizookie!  They have red velvet, which was pretty good ... but I'd probably stick to my all time favorite, white chocolate macadamia nut.

Eugene C.,"Elk Grove, CA",46,65,3,2.0,12/11/2010,"Mediocre chain restaurant and brewery. The BJ's brand beers run the gamut from very light to very dark, and they are mostly OK. They aren't exactly the experimental type, and seem to lean on the side of caution as far as flavor and hoppiness are concerned. They price their in-house beers slightly cheaper than the other small selection of local/imported craft beers they have on tap (like Stella, PBR, etc.). Price is between $4-6. Food is OK, but to me are somewhat expensive (upwards of $10) for what is just your run-of-the-mill pastas and variations on hamburgers. Nothing is exceptional or unique, and everything comes across as bland. Foodies can look elsewhere. Since there isn't much else to do in Elk Grove, on the weekends they tend to be very busy. For lack of better alternative pub options, this could be about as good as you can get around here.

Most of the time, my disappointments are understandable. In one night, over half of what my table ordered was unavailable (racks of ribs, large pizza sized pans, etc) and so we all chose something else that we ended up not being happy with. My pot roast looked like dog food and tasted how I imagined dog food to taste.  I've also had really bad experiences with the service.  I once waited over 20 minutes for ranch dressing during a slow weekday lunch hour. My server finally got it for us and told us that if we asked someone else, chances were that it went in one ear and out the other because they were not in charge of our table.  Rude!  Our server was nice, but I feel like it is only because we were the ones tipping her.  Another time, I went during a happy hour with three other friends, one who was in crutches.  We were told to wait for a table to clear up and so we did.  Every server (and even a manager!) who walked by us just glanced at us, gave us the elevator eyes, and then continued walking.  NO one asked us how we were doing or said a simple greeting.  Eventually, one of the customers sitting at a table asked my friend with the crutches if he wanted a chair.  With half an hour until happy hour was over, we noticed that over 3 tables already had their credit cards waiting but no server to pick it up. When we were finally seated (with 10 minutes to spare) our server was really nice and allowed us to order off the happy hour menu (which wasn't THAT great, $1 off drinks, $2 off appetizers, 50% off mini pizzas).

KM Y.,"Elk Grove, CA",51,13,96,2.0,7/22/2012,"Good food, BAD service. I normally go to Bj's after work on Saturday, with a coworker, because they're open late. But every time that we've gone the service has been horrible! The servers normally take a long time, are not very friendly, and they NEVER ask you if you need any change back and just take the change you should get back. One time in particular I asked our waitress if the pesto had nuts in it (I am allergic and told her that) she hesitantly said no, then about 10 minutes later she came back and said ""actually our pesto does have nuts in it. I didn't think pesto had nuts in it."" (DON'T SAY THAT IT DOESN'T THEN IF YOU HAVE NO IDEA!!!) Immediately after she took our order for appetizers and I ordered there stuffed mushrooms. I didn't read the description of the appetizer (that was my fault) but it just sounded good to me, apparently though the mushrooms had a ""drizzle"" of pesto all over them yet the waitress didn't say anything even though I told her more than once that I was allergic to nuts which was in the pesto. Our appetizers come out and the waitress immediately leaves (without seeing if everything looked ok) and I'm left with stuff mushrooms covered in pesto. The waitress disappeared for a long time and then finally walked past our table and I waved her down and asked her if the green stuff was pesto...she looked at me puzzled and said yeah. I told her once AGAIN that I am allergic to the nuts in the pesto and her response, with an attitude was ""well you shouldn't have ordered that then""...I was very irritated at this point  by her terrible customer service and just plain out stupidity, but I tried very hard to be patient. I asked her if they could remake it without the pesto and she tells me that she thinks they put the pesto in the stuffing (I was kind of speechless at this point because I wanted to yell at her) so I just changed my order altogether.  The whole time she never once apologized to me about almost killing me and she gave me attitude as though I was inconveniencing her. PLUS to top things off at the end of our meal she took our check and money and never came back with our change. To sum things up, I honestly think that this waitress is a serious liability if she doesn't know what's in the foods and obviously isn't paying attention to the customers who are specifying food allergies.

You give this place got 3 stars average but you know you come back here all the time for happy hours. I always go here for happy hours and on the weekends for there drinks. Happy hours are from 3-7PM and 10 to closing, on weekdays. I believe its a dollar off cocktails/drafts, 2 dollars off appetizers, and half off on their mini pizzas. Man that's is a deal. Why? Because that the only thing that's it good here...Appetizers, pizzas and drinks. You can only get happy hours special inside the bar area. It's first come first serve and you seat yourself. Its pretty big. I never had to wait for too long for a table.  Appetizers: I had almost all the appetizers. My two favorite and must get appetizers are going to be the chicken lettuce wraps and the Santa Fe spring rolls. YUMMM.  The chicken lettuce wraps comes with 6 cabbage leafs, a bowl of chicken mixed with seasoning and other veggies, and two yummy sauce (I believe it's housin sauce mix and the other is wasabi cream). There so much flavors going on and I absolutely love it. You feel good eating it too because it seem like a very health dish. OhhhhMG the Santa Fe Spring rolls is stuff with avocados, cream cheese, and other garnishes, all wrapped in a wonton wrap and deep fried. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. It comes with two dipping sauce but I only use the guacamole dip. Next on my must get list would be the chicken wings. Its deep fried a toss in their sauce and drizzled with ranch and hot sauce. I usually ask for the sauce on the side because I like my wing crunchy. The wings are nice and juicy and the sauce makes the everything comes together. I usually don't eat flat bread; I like my pizza fluffy. I had flat bread pizzas once here and once at Bistro 33 in Davis; BJs' is definitely better than Bistro. Everything else is pretty decent nothing to rave about but nothing to hate on either.  The only one I wouldn't recommend is probably the calamari...no good =[ just stay away from.  Pizza: The pizza crust and dough part is really fluffy, just how I like it. Beside that nothing much of different then other places. I'm not much of a pizza fan but something about half off makes everything taste better. That's a deal. You can get full off a 4 dollar pizza. They have lots of options. My favorite is the great white. Great Alfredo sauce on a pizza...YUMMY! They're not shady with their toppings either and that is always a plus. I use to order other stuff here like pasta or even there sandwiches during the lunch special but I don't think it's worth it. I am not saying it not good; I am just saying that I can something better for cheaper elsewhere.    Drinks: This is probably the best place in Elk Grove to get drinks, chill, and have a good chat with friends and family. Drinks here are ...well the best in elk grove. They have a huge cocktail list and my favorite are the mojitos. That is my favorite drink in general but bj's makes it the best. My sister usually goes for the martinis and I feel like their martinis are really strong because she always get buzz after a drink (that usually doesn't happen). They either have really strong alcohol or they are not shady about it. They have a huge selection on draft. I am not much of a beer person, but they have the beer sampler, which give you about 1.5 pint (i think) of all there beers that the make themselves. That's 8 different beers and my brother had that for his birthday and couldn't even finish it (he is a heavy drinker).  I usually don't have problem with service here. They're all nice people. Come to check on you, refill drinks, ask us if we want anything before they give us the check ... you know all the typical stuff. Sometime they can be a little slow though. When it get busy the food takes forever to come out but its a restaurant, what can you expect.  Last thing! THEIR PIZOOKIES ARE HELLLLLLLLLA BOMB!! I usually only get the original chocolate chip and vanilla bean. Its so good. The cookie is nice soft and warm, while the ice cream is creamy and cold. All together, it's like heaven in my mouth!! And you get it for free if it's your birthday! YAYYYY!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=740

The other problem is that their hosts and hostesses do not greet you with a smile or a welcome.  They look like they would rather be anywhere else than the restaurant.  Bad or slow service is not typical for BJ's but rude hosts and hostesses are always par for the course.  I actually get the feeling when I walk in that they are annoyed that another customer has arrived.  NOT a good idea for the first persons you see when you walk into a restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-elk-grove?start=740

The pizzas where are chicago deep dish and it's really good. the bread is very thick and chewy. It's so GU-UHD that a few times I just come here to get pizza to go, driving past other pizzerias. I also really enjoy the baked potatoes. they are so big it's like radioactive size or something genetically mutated to be so big! It's enough for a meal not a side. They even have a large variety of different baked potatoes too. One time i had an Alfredo Baked Potato and it was full of mouth watering goodness. There was everything you would find in Alfredo Noodles in A POTATO! BRILLIANT! The Roasted Chicken here is so enormous. my friend that we call the blackhole could barely finish it is was so big. There was also a lot of flavor and it was extremely juicy! And the Pazookies here are AWESOME!  ice cream, check! cookie, check! Assembled together, O ....M....G.... yummy!

It turned out to be a good suggestion. I was surprised at the number of people out for dinner late or out for a beer  on a Wednesday night.   The place was hopping!   I was a little concerned that it might be too noisy for dinner conversation.  Somehow, that turned out to not be a problem.   Not sure why, because the ambient room noise level was really loud. One of us had a mini-pizza, one had a dinner salad with shrimp added, one had a shrimp pasta dish. Me, I had the meatloaf.   i was feeling in a basic food sorta mood. Everyone  enjoyed their meal.  the food tasted pretty good! Table service was fast and friendly.  Portion size was pretty generous.   My meal came with cooked veggies, 3 thick slabs of meatloaf, and mashed potatoes.  I also had ordered a small dinner salad to go with it.  The lettuce was fresh, crisp, and not watery.  the blue cheese dressing was nice and not overly gooey.

When we got the food, the bread from my sandwich was soggy and my fries were cold and gross. By this time we were fed up and hubby had to talk to the manager. He came, looking extremely bored, and ""listed"" to our complaints, then just asked kind of drinks we had. Without an apology or an  ""I'll be right back"" he stormed off and sent the server back out with the soda. She basically slammed the drink on the table without saying a thing.

Ordered one night around 11:20 which is close to their closing time which I get is a little inconvenient but not that bad since it's only take out. Ordered the three mini pizookies, beignet, chicken Alfredo, and a side of wedge cut fries. When I called to order, the girl immediately seemed annoyed and asked for my number three times. When I got there she told me she didn't write my number down, which I thought was weird since she asked me to repeat it 3 times, and didn't get a chance to tell me that they were out of beignets. A little disappointed because at this point I wasn't able to substitute it for anything because it was 11:50 and the kitchen was closing and if she had written my number down I could've gotten something else. So the only thing they could give me was another pizookie, even though I've already ordered three. And they didn't give it to me for free which I had thought, they charged me. Then when I got home I saw that my chicken Alfredo was extremely dry with very little sauce and only a couple pieces of chicken and broccoli while the fries were barely cooked. So I called the next day to explain very calmly about my bad experience and how I understood that it was around closing time but still wanted good food. They sent me a $15 e-card which only made up for the pasta and we went back a few days later to use it and again had our order messed up when it was four hours before their closing time.

I ordered a lunch menu of lemon chicken with rice and said it's going to be dinner portion with a lot of rice and chicken. That was not the case. It was lunch portion at a dinner price. I argued that the serving was very thin and the brussel sprout were under cooked and under seasoned.
