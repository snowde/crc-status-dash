Cassie B.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",15,47,39,5.0,12/28/2016,"Went a little out of the way to give BJs another try because an awful experience at another location. Our server Alexandra was on top of of her stuff! She gave great service, didn't feel too rushed or neglected. She kept a smile on her face, kept our glasses full, and walked us through the holiday specials. I go out to eat often and would consider myself to be a tough critic. 5 stars easily, I would drive the extra distance to return here and get this great service again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-folsom?start=40
David T.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",46,15,16,2.0,1/29/2017,"We came here for my friends birthday on 01/19/17 and the server was nice, but very non attentive to our table. So we ordered the margarita flat bread pizza and to be honest, it was not worth the price and it tasted bland, had better pizza elsewhere. Also, my friend order parmesan chicken which tasted like it was frozen and it wasn't that hot more like room temperature. The only saving grace was the pazookie, which was the best the of night. Got the oreo, macadamian nut and salted caramel. If I had a choice I wouldn't come back here, but maybe I'll give it a chance next next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-folsom?start=40
Jeff B.,"Carmichael, CA",14,22,6,2.0,9/9/2017,"I have been to BJ's in Nevada, Sacramento,  San Rafael, Folsom and the food has been great. However the Folsom location on Bidwell St has some serious issues with the staff. We put our name on the wait list through the app. And when we entered the restaurant we waited for about 5 min while the manager and 5 of the wait staff clustered around a computer station away from the door. They had no one paying attention to arriving guests. Finally we made our way over to the cluster of wait staff and they found us on the list. We moved back by the door and they started to seat people who arrived after us. Went back to the cluster of wait staff and now they could not find us on the list. Finally they did seat us. During this time no one paid any attention to the arriving guests. Seems like they were just in their own bubble. Then we had a coupon for a free desert. The waitress said that looks like a small one. My wife said the coupon does not specify a size. She then said she will have a manager come to talk to us. He never came and after a long wait she brought the dessert. I would expect this during a soft open not from an established chain. BJs if you are listening please wake up your Folsom staff. They really need instruction in how to interact with guests.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-folsom?start=40
Congjing Z.,"Sunnyvale, CA",155,75,390,3.0,4/10/2016,"Dropped by here for a quick bite. The restaurant is very clean and the staffs are super friendly. To start off, I ordered the fried calamari. It's very well fried and seasoned. Great choice for appetizer. It's the only reason I'm giving it a 3 instead of 1 star.  Entree: hickory burger and shrimp and asparagus penne. The burger is average, abit over salted. The fries are not crunchy, but taste alright. Shrimp asparagus penne tastes like it was made by a college student. The shrimp isn't fresh, sauce tastes like canned food, and the pasta itself was over cooked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-folsom?start=40
Brookie W.,"Kailua-Kona, HI",184,1,,4.0,7/16/2017,Went on a little late minute dinner date here on a Sunday night. First impressions where mediocre due to the hostess skipping us in line for some one else. I ordered the avocado spring roles which where good but the pastry rap tasted a bit to sweet in my opinion. For the main corse I ordered the lemon thyme chicken which was better than expected. My Date ordered the chicka avocado club which was truly enjoyed.  When all is said and done service is alright. Food is pretty good but not fabulous. I would return in the future.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-folsom?start=40

Today I came for dinner and the cooks accidentally gave our pizza to the wrong table (an honest mistake) and us the incorrect pizza as well! We ended up waiting another 15 mins for our pizza but the waitress and current manager, J.R were sooo awesome and kind about the mixup. They offered our entire table appetizers or salads to eat in the mean time that would all be free, and also gave us our pizza on the house! I'm really impressed with their customer service, it's great. Always a solid time at BJS!

Nicole K.,"San Jose, CA",204,90,430,3.0,6/3/2016,"I Came here to have drinks and a light dinner.  Service was decent could've been better. The bar was only half-full & it took a while to get our server to give us menus & take our drink order. We were in the bar area. I ordered the housemaid root beer and my friend ordered one of the signature cocktails on the cocktail menu. For dinner she ordered the buffalo style boneless wings and I ordered a mini pepperoni pizza and a Caesar salad. The food came out hot, that was a plus :-) made up for the lack of service prior to getting the food. The atmosphere was fine and inviting and it was very clean. I would definitely come back again but probably sit in a different area where more servers are available.

Daffodil L.,"San Francisco, CA",12,79,93,3.0,3/27/2016,"Lunch Seared Ahi Tuna Salad which was delicious but just wayyy too expensive for what you get! Probably ~4 slices of seared tuna atop a bed of mixed greens, picked cucumbers, sliced red pepper, wonton crisps, and some dollops of wasabi on the side.  Everything was very fresh and if you're on a diet, I found the salad perfectly edible without even adding the vinaigrette dressing. The pickled cucumbers were especially tasty. As a warning, the wasabi scoops are on the perimeter of the plate, and take it from me, you do *not* want to spoon up a whole wasabi scoop accidentally...  But in the end, I paid $15 + tax + tip at lunch for mostly salad with a measly portion of fish. If it were up to me, would not come back because the value for cost is just plainly lacking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-folsom?start=40

Luis S.,"Sacramento, CA",75,11,,2.0,7/14/2017,Bj's is such a generic place. I have tried many dishes. They do not know how to cook steak. This place is just overpriced because drunk people don't care what they eat. Pizza was ok. However their best and the only reason I go there is for their piezookie.

Service was incredible. We were convinced our server had three clones of herself lol! My husband's ice tea didn't even hit the table and she already had another one waiting for him.

Linda M.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",0,11,4,2.0,6/5/2017,"I've struggled with writing this review.   We want to like this place, but it's sooo hard!  They have so many things going for it, and when they get it right, it's very very good. First, if you like having ""drinks"" with your meal, good luck.  We've experienced nothing but inconsistent serves.  So much so, we don't know what to expect anymore.  We were once served a double in the same size glass as a single at the same sitting.  When confronted, the server (and manager) tried to explain it off by saying it was due to the amount of ice in the glass!  lol...  I don't know why they're so funky about alcohol serves, but they are.  If this is important to you, don't hold your breath. Second, food delivery is a big problem.  Do not order your appetizers with your mains.  For sure, you will get them all at the same time - no matter if you ask your server not to serve them together.  You're only hope is to order them separately (if you want them separately). Lastly, it is all but guaranteed someone at your table is going to get served cold food.  I know and appreciate that it can be a challenge to coordinate everyone's meal to come up at the same time, but it seems they have given up trying long ago.  Doesn't matter if your group is large or small, someone is going to get the short end of the stick.  Hot french fries??????  We let that expectation go, long ago. Basically, if you get the proper BJ's experience, you're lucky!  When you do, it's enough to make you keep trying.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-folsom?start=40

Lori E.,"Webster Groves, Saint Louis, MO",54,1,,5.0,11/28/2016,"While out shopping my stepmom and decided to grab a bite to eat and she suggested BJ's. I had never been but she assured me that there was a huge menu and I would definitely be able to find something I liked. She was so right! Not only did I find something, I had a hard time narrowing it down!  I finally decided on a pizza, the two people I was with getting a salad and a burger. When our food came I was really blown away by the obvious food quality. You could see (and taste!) the freshness of our food that it really usually lacking in most other places. Not only was our food great but the service was too! Our server (I can't find the receipt for her name, I'm sorry!!) was nice, polite, and attentive to all our needs despite the busy time of day (Sunday, brunch/lunch, short wait, full house) But the whole reason I came here to review is our great service started at the door. I for the life of me can't remember his name (tall, blonde ponytail, super nice!) but our host was awesome, he made great conversation on the way back to our table, and even stayed to finish our conversation after we were seated that one of my guests thought he was our server! Most places the host throws down your menus and runs away so this was a great change. Definitely give this place a try, with this quality of food and amazing service you won't be disappointed. I already looked to see if there is one back in my hometown, and success! There is! Can't wait to check it out!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-folsom?start=60

It took them 25 minutes to get a bread bowl and soup out to me, by the time everyone was done I finally got my order. Don't waste your money or time here.

Marcus M.,"Folsom, CA",403,266,399,2.0,12/4/2015,I'm not a huge fan of bj's but it was the only thing open so I had to do it. I'm a firm believer that bj's has average food and beer at a high price. For appetizers I ordered the southwest egg rolls which were super mini sized but the dipping sauces that accompanied them were delicious. For the main meal I ordered the Mediterranean pizza. I'm not going to lie this pizza was legit and very enjoyable. Our waitress was prompt and nice but it annoyed the CRAP out of me that she brought us the bill before asking us if we wanted to order anything else before the kitchen closes (we came 1 hour prior to closing)! I had a pizuki and another beer ready to be devoured but we were denied due to the kitchen being closed! Boooooo bad experience... once again...next time no matter what the case may be I'm forgoing on bj's and rather eat chicken nuggets from a 10 legged chicken from McDonald's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-folsom?start=60

David L.,"Monterey Park, CA",32,5,,1.0,9/3/2017,"I went with a party of 15 on a Saturday with a reservation.  Got seated right away.  Ordered nearly $400 of appetizers, non alcoholic drinks, salads, entrees, and desserts.  Appetizers came in an average amount of time.  Entrees came at various times.  One steak order never came.  No explanation why.  When we inquired, the waiter said they overcooked the steak and had to cook another one.  I suspect they actually forgot.  They comped a soup and salad to the starving patron.  By that time, everyone in my party finished eating.  She had to take the steak to go.  On top of that, they never refill the cups of water.  I went out several times to the bar to get water for myself and my daughter.  Even worse, when the appetizers came, there were no small plates at each seat.  When I asked for some, they didn't bring enough for everyone.  I went through several cabinets to find more.  When the bill came, they double charged us for the steak (they removed one charge when I complained).  Take it from a Berkeley MBA (I am also a physician) --- take your business elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-folsom?start=60

Carly A.,"Irvine, CA",2,149,,4.0,8/16/2016,"I've been here a countless number of times mostly because my mom loves this place. In the past (when I didn't care about my calorie intake lol) I would almost always get their pasta because it is just so good. Lately though I've been more conscious of how many calories I take in so that's where I'm grateful that they have a ""light"" section in their menu and it actually offers a lot more choices than other places I've been to. I normally order a chicken or their shrimp pasta from there but when we were there last on Sunday I decided to try one of their salads because I've never had one here before. My family and I came in on Sunday and it was beyond crowded. Despite that, our waitress was still very attentive and sweet. I forgot the name of the dish I ordered but it was a kale salad with a strawberry vinaigrette. It also came with brussel sprouts and sprinkles of grapes and blueberries. I personally wasn't a fan of the salad because kale and brussel sprouts are naturally bitter and topping that with the sour vinaigrette just didn't taste pleasant to me so I'm never going to order that again lol. The grapes and blueberries definitely offset that though, being as sweet as they were so thankfully that was on the plate. My family and I always order the wings that come with a side of buffalo sauce and ranch as appetizers and those are always super good and crispy. My mom always gets the clam chowder in a bread bowl and I always take some of that because I love how crunchy their bread is and when dipped in the soup it's sooo good (literally drooling rn).

Lexie K.,"Folsom, CA",0,11,4,2.0,7/28/2017,"I have waited quite some time to write this review in hopes that my experiences were maybe just a one-off, but it seems that isn't the case. I've eaten here plenty of times, both inside and takeout, and here's why this particular BJ's is getting 2 stars. Positive: Waiters, waitresses, and hosts are always nice. I have no issue with the customer service whatsoever, they have always been great. 1st Negative: Takeout is NEVER on time. When you say 20-25 mins and take 45-60, that's not cool. And it happens literally every time. The one that sticks out in my mind is when I waited over 50 mins in the takeout area for my food (a burger and chicken). And this was in addition to the 25 minutes that they said it would take. I'm a pretty patient person, but that's just insane. During that time all I was offered was a cup of water. Wonderful. 2nd Negative: The food itself. In the restaurant, the quality is fine. If you order takeout, it's awful. I have gotten soggy eggrolls, cold fries, overcooked and undercooked steaks, wilted salad, cold mashed potatoes, and burnt burgers. I live 5 mins from BJ's, doubt the drive caused any of that. 3rd Negative: The orders are always, always messed up. Sides of sauce are always missing, entree sides are usually wrong, modifications (i.e. no pickles) are forgotten, etc. And I totally understand that this happens sometimes, it's no big deal. But this happens every time. Every. Time.  So, BJ's, I tried to like you, but I don't. I think the kitchen may be the issue, but I really don't know. At this point, I'm over it.

We have the Premier Rewards card also so it's not like they had the card and we didn't. We had a $25 voucher for the Rewards loyalty program that we tried to use last night and were told the system wasn't working to give us that deal but they could give us a ""complimentary"" $10 off and we can use the $25 off next time. Well, that ""complimentary"" $10 off is the promotion they are running at the moment when you spend $35. I would rather them offer that promotion instead of acting like they did us a favor for giving us $10 off. Seemed kind of fake but oh well. Like I said, the food is always good and the menu is massive. Also, where is the pumpkin pizookie! We asked the hostess and she said to ask the waitress. We asked the waitress and she said she didn't know. We asked the manager and he said maybe sometime in mid Nov but not sure.

Great layout with large bar area, booths, tables and area for larger groups in back.  The food was good. I mean really good for chain style eating faire. I had the calamari and a flat bread pizza. My friends had the gluten free pizza and salads. Everyone said the food was good and had no complaints.  The server was awesome. She kept up filled up and met all our needs on a very timely and friendly manner. That's hard to find these days.  The bar area was really fun. We had a booth.

If you were there did you notice how slippery and unsafe the floors were and no ""Slippery Be Careful"" caution signs. Did you fall or almost fall?

Hours later at Sutter Hospital in Jackson she was diagnosed with a fractured knee cap(patella) in med terms.

I ordered take out this evening and it didn't go well. The order: 1 Nacho 1 Pale Ale Chili 1 Beef Sliders 1 Avocado Egg Roll 1 Pepsi The problem - when I arrived at the curb side takeout, I called the number and it took quite a while just to get someone to pickup the phone.  Irritating but not the main complaint. The chips of the nachos were covered with the mix and thrown in a tin.  Maybe I'm asking too much but I have come to expect through my to-go orders that the chips and the mix are separated so you don't end up with nacho soup.   The bowl of Pale Ale Chili would have been great if I wasn't given a cup. The beef sliders were missing everything but the lettuce and pickle.  According to the online menu, I'm missing onions and ketchup. The avocado egg rolls didn't taste like they usually do, some how between the spices and cooking process, the avocado tasted metallic ( two others verified this, unprompted and I didn't ask a loaded question; ""Like does it taste like metal?"", the plus side being I know I'm not completely nuts.   The Pepsi.  This was ridiculous.  I ordered a Pepsi, that was $2.95.  I knew it might be quite over priced.  Wow was I off.  The plastic cup that I was given is smaller than a red SOLO cup.  Oh and they were out of lids, so the whole way home I played don't spill the soda.   Short of wanting ""A Drink Like That"" - I will never be going back there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-folsom?start=120

Several minutes later, the server came back and told us the manager had re submitted our orders and our food would be out soon.  About 30 minutes later or so later, our order came out.  They obviously made NO extra effort to get our food out to us since the thin crust pizzas too longer to get out than the deep dish.  At least, this time our food was perfect. When we got our bill, we noticed they had given about an $11.00 discount.  That was appreciated, but we were a bit miffed that the manager couldn't find 60 seconds of his/her time to stop by our table to make sure we were satisfied and offer an apology.

We got the Quinua Shrimp, Cherry Glazed Salmon, and BJ's Classic Flatbread Pizza. My mother in law is allergic to spice so we requested her shrimp to be spice free. The kitchen responded beautifully. Her dish came out with perfectly balanced flavor and not a hint of spice. A happy mum in law makes for a happy family. Thanks BJ's!  My husband loved his meat extravaganza (pizza) and my salmon was delicious, but I couldn't finish my plate because I was too full--that's ok though. I love leftovers!

Dan K.,"Roseville, CA",128,171,35,1.0,10/8/2017,"Having been to this and other locations, this is so far my least favorite... I've been here twice, a fairly long time ago and a few weeks ago for takeout.  Although my first visit was probably a year ago, I still remember it fairly well, as if it was yesterday, so that could've changed, but more or less, this is a blended review from both visits combined. The service was probably some of the worst I've received, ever.... it was fairly slow when I came here. I'm not sure if our waitress had a bad or an off day, or maybe she was new, or just didn't want to be there. It took us a while to get our orders in. The drinks took almost 20 mins to come out. One of the appetizer came out before the drinks, while the second appetizer never came out at all, nor did the soup. Although they made it to the final bill, which we had to fix, which probably caused another 15-20 minutes delay, I can say I'm glad that I didn't have to pay for something that I never got.... the food was pretty good, although they did get the order wrong, completely missing the few special requests I made.  My second visit was for take out, since the food was decent the first time, but the service was bad and I really didn't want not have an extra couple hours to spare... this was completely the opposite experience. They were friendly, helpful, attentive, getting the order right, getting me out on my way quickly! The food this time however was the complete opposite... we ordered pasta, jambalaya and a couple of appetizers. The appetizers were decent (not as good as the first time), the entrees were mediocre at best. We might as well went to the grocery store down the street, went to their frozen food section and it would've been better and cheaper. We couldn't even finish the entrees aside from a few bites...  All in all, the 1 star rating is a blended reflection of what I've experienced in the couple of times I've been here. If I ever have to come out to this place, I will probably make sure to drive an extra 20-30 mins, to get to a different location, as I've had better experiences at those...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-folsom
Ram G.,"Folsom, CA",2,46,13,3.0,10/2/2017,"Our family of 4 were there yesterday October 1st for dinner. This is not the first time we went here. In general, we wait for 30 - 45 minutes to be seated. We heard about the Bj's app to get on the priority waiting list? Any way that was useless because our name was never on the list after we reached the restaurant. Fortunately, there was no wait and we were seated immediately. Our waiter was Mr. Steve and he was absolutely great.  We ordered one cocktail, and 2 soft drinks between 4 of us. After the drinks arrived, we also placed an order for 3 appetizers (tortilla chips with spinach & artichoke dip (yum), Mozzarella Sticks, Avocado Egg Rolls ( the best and dish unique to BJ's), 2 Entrees ( 2 Shrimp and Asparagus penne). The food was great, hot and delicious. Service by Steve is Immaculate. So why am I giving 3 instead of 5 stars. Here is the reason: One of the waitress (don't know the name) got our Entree's before the appetizers. When we asked her why, she asked us, ""do you want me take this back?"" Really? To my understanding, the word appetizer means: "" a small dish of food or a drink taken before a meal or the main course of a meal to stimulate one's appetite."" Then Steve came and he was at least honest and told us why there was this mix up. Oh! yeah, We got a free Pizookie (white chocolate macadamia cookie) for registering our app. I may be severe with my 3 star rating. If I have the option, I would give 3.5 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-folsom

However, even though I could walk here from my house, I just do not go here very often. In reading the menu and trying to decide what to eat today, I asked myself why I do not come here more often.  I settled on the potato skin appetizer and a half rack of baby back ribs, which comes with two sides (I ordered cheesy mashed potatoes and clam chowder). The skins were much smaller than I remember and they had very little cheese on them. The clam chowder was decent but not great and the mashed potatoes were good, but served without gravy. The ribs were, like the soup, decent but not great. However, they were very small. Overall, the food was nothing better than average.  Our waitress was attentive enough but a little annoying. For example, we had been done with the appetizer and the plate sat on the edge of the table. She asked if she could take the empty plate and then actually waited for a response.

This review is strictly for our lunch/food experience today. Suzan, our waitress was a gem and took really good care of us. She was friendly, personable and very accommodating.  Ordered an appetizer to start. The Siracha Brussels sprouts. I highly recommend this dish. Not too spicy and the sprouts were cooked perfectly...still had just a bit of a crunch to them. My wife ordered the clam chowder in the sourdough bread bowl. Middle of the road chowder but the bowl was exceptional. I had a good time eating what was left of the bowl after she was done. She also had a small ceasar salad...again middle of the road but damn decent nonetheless. I opted for the Mahi-mahi fish tacos. I don't think that there is such a thing as a bad taco. If there is, I have not been introduced to it. My tacos today were a little different in that they came in a light pita shell. Ingredients were on point but the shells were a little too soft and doughy in the middle and a little too crunchy around the edges. A minor issue because if I am being completely honest, I would probably eat a plate of tacos even if the shells were completely made of cardboard. I told you...I love tacos that much!

The burger was good, really enjoyed the spicy flavor, the broccoli was gross.  The broccoli was lukewarm, overcooked and tasted old.   My other half ordered the  black and bleu burger. It's beef patty with chipotle, bleu cheese, bacon, grilled onions, tomatoes, on a Parmesan-crusted bun with roasted garlic aioli and fries.    Again burger was spot on good but the fries were lukewarm and tasted old.

It was very busy but we scored one of the last booths in the bar and were greeted promptly, water and drinks came and orders taken perfectly. Even with the happy hour signs staring at us we figured we were out of luck since not on Saturday. But alas we were informed by our server that happy hour was on since an NFL game. How great is that!  So four of us chowed down on deep dish, mini-pizzas for 1/2 off, chips and queso and a full-size burger with fries for $6. Food came out piping hot without much wait and our server did a nice job checking in on us. Pizzas were excellent and the burger had nice toppings; not the best beef ever but decent.

I was told the wait was 20 min to get my food and in the end it was an hour waiting.

Guy confirms I'm in the system.  I get there at around 715 and the other half of my party is there and tell me that my call ahead wasn't in the system. I go to the hostess stand and double check. The girl goes ""yeah we can't find you."" Then...just a staring contest. I ask how long it would be if I were to add my name now and she goes to confer with the others behind her. My sister walks in and I explain to her how the call ahead didn't get through and now I'm checking wait times. The hostess returns and says ""well, you would've had to wait anyway because there are other large parties here that also called ahead, so..."" 1) That's not the point. The point is I called and confirmed my name on the list and no such thing ever occurred.  2) What if I called BEFORE the other parties? Now you'll never know because I wasn't on the list.

Jennifer S.,"Sacramento, CA",3358,493,984,4.0,3/9/2014,"BJ's has one of the biggest menus of any restaurant in the area. You can satisfy pretty much any craving here.  If you only get one thing, get a pizooki: an amazing soft gooey cookie served to you hot in the cast iron it was just cooked in, topped with ice cream and whipped cream. The best flavors are white chocolate raspberry and red velvet. I haven't tried it yet, but they now have a gluten-free pizooki, too.  The pizzas are really good. The crust is a little bit on the thicker side, but is really flavorful, and doesn't have that bread-y taste that some pizzas have. My personal favorite is the sweet pig pizza. The wedge salad here is one of my favorite salads anywhere. It probably has a ton of calories, since it's smothered in bleu cheese, but it's amazing. Maybe what makes it so good is that it's literally a quarter wedge of a lettuce head, so it's really fresh, as opposed to shredded lettuce which is allowed to be prepared well before it's served. The giant baked potatoes are pretty legit, but they are really truly giant. I'd recommend either splitting, or getting a half order with soup or salad. The house beers are amazing. My last four paragraphs started with the same word because I had a Jeremiah Red earlier. Word to the wise, they will let you sample small servings of beer for free, so you can make sure you like it before you buy it. The avocado egg rolls here are not the best ever, but they are pretty legit. The only problem is that sometimes the avocado is over-ripe (I've had this happen probably 1/3 of the time).  This is a good location. Even though they are always packed, they seat pretty quickly, they are usually very clean, and the staff has great customer service in spite of the fact that they all appear to be under 18.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-folsom?start=80

The mashed potatoes were soooo good along with the onion straws. for dessert we got the lemon and blueberry pizookie and mmmmm heaven is a fresh out of the oven chocolate chip cookie with cold vanilla bean ice cream melting all over it!   All in all it was a perfect dinner and my mom was very happy and had a great time.

There were five of us, but not everyone got the same treatment. Some had drink refills, others did not. Awkward. It took a long time to get our food and even longer time to get the attention of our server for any reason.

(our server was Aishani) I ordered a raspberry sparkling lemonade which the server confirmed, she brought back two waters. Never got that drink. She never checked on us once we got our food. My husband had half of his fries left so asked her if he could get another side of BBQ sauce .... ten minutes later (after serving other tables) she came over and asked if we would like any dessert. I said ""no but can we get that side of BBQ sauce?"" Five minutes later.... after she'd served two other table multiple times.... still no BBQ sauce. So I stopped another server and asked her if we could get some... she went straight to the kitchen and came right back out with our sauce. Yay. I think her name was Sam.  On the other hand our regular server came right after saying I see Sam got you the sauce.  :|  yes she did. And later Sam even asked us if we wanted a refill on our waters which our regular server did not, not even once. And now we're going to see how long it is until she comes to pick up the check so we can leave. It's already been about five minutes. Oh look Sam took it for us what a great server she is. I hate bashing on servers because I know they get a lot of crap from people. But my husband and I have been very patient and I feel like we are being ignored because we are only two people and  not four like the other tables (bigger tips). Ok so we didn't receive the right change with our check so now we are waiting on that.

Rose G.,"Folsom, CA",2296,167,106,5.0,1/6/2015,"BJ's is one of those restaurants that you actually appreciate the fact it is a chain.  From the moment you pull in to the parking lot you know you will have a good experience. The parking lot is never full as they have ample parking, even though it shares it with other businesses. Sometimes there may be a wait for a table on a weekend night, but the front of house is run smoothly and efficiently so you never have to wait long. The longest i have ever waited for a table was 6-10 minutes during dinner rush on a saturday night on a holiday weekend. That in itself says a lot about the restaurant. As you get seated in a COMFORTABLE AND PRIVATE BOOTH OR TABLE, you are immediately greeted by your server and they have a wide selection of craft beers, unique cocktails, and the usual array of soft drinks, etc. I always recommend trying their house made root beer or one of their cocktails,  Their menu's signature dishes are always superb, and range from classic burgers to GLUTEN FREE pizza, to pasta dishes and health conscious dishes. I ALWAYS bring large groups here as not only do they have ample space for large parties, but they have such a diverse menu, there is literally something for everyone. They also have SEASONAL MENU ADDITIONS which are just a delicious as their regular items. Some personal favorite dishes are the WATERMELON and FETA SALAD, the SPINACH AND ARTICHOKE DIP, the CAJUN PASTA, the ENLIGHTENED SCALLOPS, and BBQ BISON BURGER. Oh, and of course you have to cap off your evening with a PIZOOKIE, I am a fan of their GLUTEN FREE CHOCOLATE CHIP.  Service is always excellent, even on busy nights, and being a regular I believe i have been served by all of their waitstaff. They always have a smile on their face, they are FAST AND PROMPT, and in the past year of going maybe once every couple weeks I have only had one small error to an order. Food is usually out quickly, and you never feel stranded after your food is served. Their hours are amazing, one of the only open past 10pm establishments in the Folsom area. Overall, amazing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-folsom?start=180

Funny!   Then our server came around and other than trying to get us to have as many refills of beer as possible, was pretty inefficient.  First of all she never got us refills of soda or iced tea until we flagged her down. If I want to have dry-mouth eating, I will go to a Thai or Vietnamese restaurant with one server.  BJ's has 30 servers and everyone is inexplicably in the back doing God knows what.  She also gave me wedge fries instead of skinny; and didn't tell us that the veggie pizza is on wheat crust now.  The pizza was also slightly burned.  Wheat crust is really unappealing.  I like veggies, but that doesn't mean I am a whole grain hippie who enjoys eating a deep dish pizza that tastes like a slice of dry Ezekiel bread.     We didn't even get a pizzooki!  We were over  BJS like we're all over Kim Kardashian on the ""news.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-folsom?start=180

Open seating in the bar is always a plus when you don't want to wait around. She made great suggestions for beers and eats and it was awesome.

I'd be happy to take her off your hands. I just hope Taylor is there next time we come in. Her constant smile definitely made the day a little easier.

Michael A.,"Loomis, CA",7,56,6,3.0,6/16/2016,"The last visit could be summed up as strikingly average.  It wasn't disappointing but given all the other dining options it didn't provide much reason to return.  My girlfriend's Barbecue Chicken Chopped Salad was average.  The chicken looked like it had been taken out of a plastic bag marked ""diced cubes of barbecued chicken"", warmed up, and mixed with the salad.  The Mahi-Mahi Tacos were average.  The sauce was a little too bland for me; it existed to cement the meat and vegetable filling together rather than add some spice.  The new beer on tap (Magnolia Peach) was okay. The house Hefeweizen was pretty tasty, but not enough to warrant a refill.  I think the correlation between taste and price is where BJ's beer falls short.  The beers are reduced from $6.50 to $5.50 for Happy Hour.  If the house beers were exceptional this would be a great deal, but the house beers are too generic to make the brewery a destination.  Think of BJ's as a Chili's or an Applebee's that brews its own corporate beer.  If you want to drink something unique or complex, BJ's probably won't have it.  If you want a beer that's not Budweiser to go with your meal, BJ's will suffice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-folsom?start=160

In fact, BJ's gluten free pizza was one of the best Kris and I ever had.  The salads weren't outstanding, typical restaurant starter salads.  I got the House Salad with Italian dressing while Kris had the Wedge Salad.  But the pizza was SO good. Thin crust with melt-y fontina cheese topped with sweet caramelized onions and grilled Portobello mushrooms. Gosh I want some right now!

Not a good quantity or quality and it only had 4 pieces. Then the couscous was so skimpy too, not even funny. There was maybe two table spoons worth of couscous in the box. Not even kidding. There was so little couscous that it looked like someone had already ate part of my meal. The other thing that bothered me was that everything in the box was floating and swimming in juice. Literally more juice than the actual couscous. I have always gotten this meal and I know what it should look like. In my many years, it has NEVER been like this so I know it's not normal. I expect more than a few strands of veggies, a couple table spoons of couscous with a box full of juice. Very disappointed.

I called our waiter over and he apologized and said he would go get it for me. After five minutes he didn't return. Someone from the kitchen brought out our entrees but not our appetizer. My husband mentioned this to her and she went and retrieved our fried artichokes. When our waiter finally returned he apologized for still not having my drink and I told him to just forget about it. The food was great but the service was horrible. The last time I went to BJ's was with my mom for lunch. We both ordered a salad and endless soup, the tomato basil bisque. BJ'S has really good soups. The waitress brought out only one soup and told us we could share since they were making a fresh batch. That was a little awkward.

Madeline O.,"Chicago, IL",1,20,3,1.0,1/20/2013,"If I could give no stars I would.  The best adjective to describe my experience was disconcerting.  Let me describe what happened. We arrived on a Sunday evening (1/20/13 around 8pm) and were promptly seated since the restaurant was half empty (the hostess was great).  Our waiter (and another staff member) were preoccupied with a group of young girls and were unable to provide any service unless prompted.  Our party observed the male waiters flirt with these girls multiple times for long periods while we received little to no service.  We patiently waited for an excess of thirty minutes before we flagged down someone to take our order.  In this half empty restaurant we needed to ask for utensils, refills, order food, and to receive our order.  To add insult to injury the waiter forgot portions of our order.  Frustrated, I approached the staff member and asked  to be helped while he was still flirting with the girls. Needless to say this made the young girls angry. Those girls started to talk about (and make fun of ) our party WITH the waiters. Aware that the girls were young teenagers we disregarded the taunts and attempted to continue our dinning experience. We observed both waiters continually attending to the young girls and joining in on their conversation about OUR party.  This was BY FAR the worst dinning experience of my life.

Tonight after a 3 mile hike and a couple of hours of intervals road riding we didn't feel like eating out. I ordered to go from BJs. I hardly ever eat burgers, but had a hankering for one tonight. I placed a simple order. When ordering for pick up the gentleman was very pleasant and seemed proficient. I had the option to ""add cheese"". I asked specifically to add BLEU CHEESE crumbles. When my husband came back with a soggy burger that had some cheap bleu cheese dressing poured all over it, I was EXTREMELY disappointed to say the least. I don't eat burgers often and was really looking forward to it after my extremely active day...therefore I ate the slop.

My mom, my four-year-old nephew and I had to wait during every process of our visit. Just to order drinks, 20 mins. Ordering food, over 20 minutes. Getting refills, your check and boxes...don't even know how long it took. Our waitress was terrible. She basically wasn't even our waitress because I had ask other people to get things for us because she never checked on us. As for my order, the food was good except she gave me the wrong order. I would've sent it back but by that time, I was starving and wasn't in the mood anymore. Also, my nephew's food was given at the exact same time as my mom and I's food. First rule of dining with a kid, their food should always be served first! When we got our food, our waitress didn't come to ask us how everything was at all. She came at the end. No refills...NOTHING! My mom and I had every intention of ordering dessert when we came in, but we were just so fed up with the experience that we had to leave. People who gotten there before us had their food and orders before us. It was so frustrating to deal with, especially on my birthday. I used to really love this place because of the service.

One person ordered the Moroccan Salmon and the filet was dryer than your mouth after smoking meth. They had it sent back and chose the bison burger instead. I ordered the bison burger as well. Patty was cold. And there was a ton of cumin seasoning all over my plate. What I realized shortly after was that they probably forgot to season the coleslaw so they just hit it with some cumin after the fact. Tasted like crap. I ordered a side of fries as well. They came out about one minute before I finished my burger The person who returned the salmon received their bison burger. The patty looked phenomenal compared to mine, but they had no seasoning at all on the coleslaw.  What I've realized is that BJ's is awesome for appetizers and good brews.

I ordered the tilapia off of the healthier options part of the menu. When it came out it was a good size on a bed of rice with a side salad. I didn't eat the salad because it was the rabbit food kind and I prefer the crunchy iceberg lettuce. It wasn't the best fish I've had, but it wasn't bad either. The waitress was polite and efficient.

Joe N.,"Folsom, CA",440,151,36,1.0,3/23/2012,"this place has gone down in service and in food quality. I must bother my fellow yelpists with a long story. as a self proclaimed foodie, friends like to accompany my wife and I to eat so they can try new things. a friend who just moved from Arizona and after a long day of shooting and driving around folsom a group of 5 of us built up an appetite, we decided to go to BJ's to watch the bulls game and allow my Arizonan friend try the famous pizzookie. boy was that a mistake. we ordered 3 burgers,  1 fish and chips, 1 nachos for food. Drinks ordered: 1 soda, 3 waters and friend ordered a Jeremiah Red. from the time we sat down to the time we got our drinks? 20 mins. from the time we got our drinks to out server to get our orders?+20mins at this point we wanted drinks refilled. this is the time the Red came out. the Hostess not our server finally bring out the food. as soon as she set down the food she knocks over a full cup of water. but instead of truly caring she looks almost annoyed at us, looks at my friend asks him if hes ok. he replies with a yeah, but guess what? the water was totally going the other direction on the table and the person opposite him totally gets drenched, looking like she has loss control of her bladder. while she spills this water she drops part of my wifes fries. all thats left was 5 1/2 fries. but instead of saying hey i'll bring you a new side of fries she just drops the rest of the food off and walks away.  Dang it just writing this makes my blood boil how crappy the service is. eff the story here was everything that was wrong: - service took forever we were there for lunch and it took over 2 hours. -hostess brings out our food spills multiple things gives us a half hearted apology and walks away not even cleaning it. -server is off doing her own thing. comes by maybe 4 times during the duration of our stay.  -all of the burgers were asked for for medium/rare. one burger came out half burnt/half pink. one burger was missing the lettuce tomatoes and onions -we had to wait extra long for our food with no update from our server or refills . -the nachos we had were pretty much chips with cheese, none of the other toppings were on there in any quantity to be considered acceptable. -we ask for the manager it takes another 10 mins, we then complain to the manager, manager makes crap excuses  says he will take care of one of the burgers and then tries to UPSELL us a pizzookie. -we finish food in 15 mins we try to get our check, cant get a hold of our server. dirty plates on our table for another 15 mins. only after i started to take pictures of our food does the manager come by and clear our table. - trying to get the check that the manager had to hand us. he asks us if we wanted a pizzookie my arizonan friend never trying one we agreed. in the end of this disgusting ordeal. We ended up still paying 40 dollars for the meal. manager only comping the burgers and the pizzookie.  i've told everyone i could about this issue and it seems like i am not the only one who had a crap experience like this.

Jillian O.,"Camino, CA",3,4,,2.0,1/21/2015,"My last two visits to this particular BJ's were less than satisfactory. Last night in particular was probably the worst. We had a party of 10 and they told us there would be a short wait due to a party just finishing up and just paid. Apparently in their eyes ""finishing up"" means 30minutes +. We finally got tired of waiting since it was getting later than we wanted and they could only seat our party in two booths next to each other. Not ideal when the guests of honor couldn't even sit with one another. Finally after getting our drinks (wrong I add, and with getting a new server right after ordering drinks) we ordered our food and they were able to move our group to a table where everyone was able to sit together. One appetizer finally came, but my salad I had ordered to come out before my entree never showed up. Once the food arrived luckily MOST everything was correct. I had to ask for my salad which did come out correct. Another person's order was the complete wrong item, and the server said ""I'm sorry, I heard you talking about another item so I thought you just wanted that"".  I feel part of the issue is the switching of servers, and other servers bringing out food to tables they have no idea what they ordered. This is not the first time the orders have been mixed up and I've only experienced it at BJ's. Also, if you no longer make the boneless wings, take them off the menu!

Service here was always terrible. But there was one, particularly bad, night I had dinner here with my boyfriend. We received, possibly, the worst service EVER.  So we ordered the Santa Fe spring rolls and shared the BBQ chicken pizza. He had a coke which he had a hard time getting refilled. The first time he asked her she took his cup and never came back. Then he asked her where his coke went and she had forgotten it in the kitchen. She came back after 10 minutes. This happened probably two more times with my water refill and his coke. Then she got our order wrong. Gave us the Avocado egg rolls instead of the spring rolls. Then we had no plates or silverware and it took forever to get her attention. She was too busy chitchatting with a group of guys at the bar and then moved to the kitchen entrance to chitchat with her coworker. Seriously? When we finally got the check, my boyfriend and I were surprised to see that our bill was $60. All we ordered were the pizza, appetizer and soda. Then we realized it was because she charged us for several items we didn't even order! What the hell was wrong with her? In the end, she apologized to us profusely and fixed the bill so we left her SOME kind of tip. We were much too nice. I've also been here for Happy Hour. HORRIBLE prices for Happy Hour drinks and consistently horrible service. At least they're consistent?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-folsom?start=260
AJ V.,"Carmichael, CA",1,13,,3.0,7/24/2013,"Gonna start with a pleasant surprise - the seared ahi is AWESOME. Who woulda thunk it? BJ's, you get an entire star just for that. As for brew, IPA fans should down a couple Hopstorms. Tastes like it sounds, in a very good way! Lager fans will enjoy the Oasis Amber (featured as of this writing). It's mellow and slightly skewed toward the malty side of the spectrum. Good show with the brews, BJ's! You earn another star. Of course, that leaves only one star for the rest of the dining experience. Uh, oh... Friday, 5:15 on a scorching hot afternoon: My wife and I enter BJ's Folsom location with healthy appetites and driving thirsts. We start with appetizers and a couple beers. Our server brings the beer, but mistakenly serves us each the wrong one. To be fair, the Oasis and Hopstorm have similar color when served. The two taste so different that I notice the error immediately and we switch our pints. No harm done. The restaurant isn't very busy yet, so we see most of the wait staff, including our server, congregating together chatting amongst themselves at one station near the rear of the dining area, opposite the bar. Remember the appetizers I mentioned earlier? Our server didn't. 45 minutes go by until she returns to the table to tell us the appetizers should be up soon, and by the way, are we ready to order our entrees? We place our dinner orders. A few minutes later, our appetizers arrive... cold. Our server, who was standing nearby, must have overheard us talking about it. She came back and said, ""Oh, are they cold?"" (Anyone think she doesn't already know they're cold? Neither do I.) Anyway, she does the right thing by getting us new appetizers and not charging for one of them. Soon after, warm appetizers arrive. Hooray! But wait, our entrees are ready, too. What a predicament. Eat the hot entrees and let the now-warm appetizers get cold again, or eat the appetizers and let the entrees go cold? Heck, I think I need another Hopstorm. Where did our server go? Looking around, I see that the staff is no longer aimlessly loitering about and that the Manager is in the house. Coincidence? I managed to order another beer, and we proceed to devour the surprisingly good food we are finally served, followed up with Chocolate Pazookie for desert (which my wife ordered, since I refuse to say the word ""Pazookie"" out loud) So, after all was said and done, it ending up being a nice -  wait a minute... what's this? We were overcharged for beer. Dang.  A note to the BJ's Manager: The food is spot on, but table service sucks.

What I really appreciated was I never had to call our server for a refill as she was always checking in and she also kept our waters full - always a good idea during a long game!

It took 30 minutes after we got our drinks to put our food order in then 45 minutes after that we finally got our food. However, the fries that came with one of the burgers were cold and the other burger didn't even come with fries or the onion strings that came on the burger. After telling the server about the onion strings, we never got them. We had to wait another 20 minutes for the fries that didn't show up originally. We went for a birthday and we had told our server about it, and he said he would bring a pazokee but it never came. They even ended up running out of co2 for the soda machine!!

The BJs special pizza was also good, basically combination pizza consisted of sausage, pepperoni, etc. For appetizers ordered the chicken wings, which was amazing, that's a must. Finally the sampler which had artichoke dip (loved it really hot), avocado egg rolls ( did not like at all, no flavor and the dipping sauce was horrible), southwestern egg rolls (pretty good, had zesty taste to it), and mozzarella sticks (pretty typical).

We were seated in the massive dining room an there were televisions in view of everyone, including my baby who loved that. He never sees TV so boom! He learned how to watch the NBA Playoffs at dinner. WE had a booth and it was comfy and not too loud which was nice.  Our server came over and while taking our drink orders informed us there were ""no specials"" on anything, ok. When my sis asked which drink she preferred between one or the other she said she liked one, but gave no reason why, um ok. She took our drink orders and left, we had all asked for water also, I think it is customary to ask now which is nice sometimes you get water and didn't need or want it. Wasteful these days!  Returning about 10 minutes later with no drinks she said that they were out of IPA beer, would I like something else. Sure, did they have a comparable one? She looked at me blankly and said "" here is the menu"" I think the servers should know a bit about their drinks, but here I guess not. Also I think it would have been appropriate for her to bring everyone elses drinks as it was hot out and hey maybe they were thirsty. I chose another beer and when she returned again with all our drinks we asked again for water, since she had forgotten it.  We ordered a pizza which came out in great time, it was super good, but we had to ask the busser cleaning the table next to us for peppers/cheese etc. He looked confused/pissed that we asked him and walked away. He returned a minute later and smiled at me then started to clean the table next to us again. Our server appeared in a few minutes and asked what we needed, uh why did she have to be bothered?

Calzone dough very good, almost flaky, nicely browned, not doughy.  Marinara sauce, cheese, and ingredients all very good, EXCEPT the meatball was not whole meatballs.  It HAD TO BE previously frozen little diced pieces of very processed meatball mixture.  And those little pieces were flavorless.  They could have disguised the processed nature of the meatball filling with some herbs in it. We would order the calzone again, just with a different meat, although the meatball experience makes me wonder how processed the sausage filling might be.

Jason C.,"Shingle Springs, CA",6,35,28,4.0,11/28/2015,"So in general I enjoy to sit and eat at all restaurant bars if possible. BJs has an amazing bar. I do feel like it should be a little longer and whats with the two seat low corner on the end?..... Oh well, all of that really doesn't matter because the service, and the food were amazing. The menu is somewhat of a book that can be a little tough to navigate but believe me if you are hungry take the time to read it. If you are a craft brew fanatic this is a good stop so put it on your list. I ordered the wings with the xxxxtra hot buffalo sauce. The sauce wasn't as hot as the menu would lead you to believe but as a wing addict these were very good. I give BJs Brewhouse 4 stars, the atmosphere is inviting and there is something for everyone to enjoy.

S B.,"Sacramento, CA",0,63,32,3.0,6/24/2016,"Let's say you are, driving across the country. You've been driving all day, you're tired. You're hungry. You need something to eat. You know what you like. You like burgers and fries. You stop at McDonald's because they all look the same and you know exactly what you're getting, whether you're in San Diego or Atlanta. If you have time to look stuff up and maybe check your Yelp or something then you find the place that does crawdads or bison steaks. That's... why you go to BJ's. You know exactly what you're getting. It's a known commodity. That said, BJ's, and chain brew pubs like them have always been an anomaly to me. If all I want to do is eat, I'll go to Burger King. If all I want to do is eat, and I want to go to a nice place, I'll go to a nice place to eat. If I want to hang around and drink, I'll go to some old, rustic pub with some character to it. Bricks. Real bricks. Massive wooden timber trusses. The thing about BJ's, and the strip malls in which they sit, is that Scotty can teleport you to one in Fresno, Stockton, Sacramento, Los Angeles, Phoenix, or wherever they have these things and you wouldn't have a clue where you were because they all look exactly the same, and they all have the aroma of fresh stucco and construction adhesive. Kind of like the rest of the strip mall, as well as the oversized, overpriced, slapped together in a hurry tract homes in the neighborhoods surrounding the area. Which is fine and all, except... the place isn't cheap. It's kind of pricey, for what it is. The food is fine, I can usually manage to order up something that will fit within my special dietary requirements and enjoy it most places, and this place is no exception, but food wise, although it's better than Denny's, it isn't much better. It still has the ambiance of a hospital cafeteria, and, well there are the TV's. Obviously I've gone there, and more than once, but generally I'm with a group or it's someone else's idea. If I'm meeting someone for whatever reason, the place really doesn't matter. Otherwise, if I'm hanging out, I'm not going to be in the middle of suburbia anyway, so I guess a BJ's wouldn't be applicable. Don't take this as a negative. It's a fine place to bring a group of people. Be prepared to drop some coin. The menu is big enough most people can be accommodated. Also, they are a brew pub, so if thick, sugary, syrupy, overly-hopped craft beers are your thing (and there are lots of people that do like them) then this is your place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-folsom?start=100

Last time I got to go the food was ruined from sitting in the warmer while waiting for a salad. Also the salad hardly came with any dressing. I was scrapping it out of the cup to even get half what should be on the salad. They had told me when i called that it would be 20 minutes. When i arrived i had to wait another 15. I went back and it was replaced but the manager for some reason kept asking me if it was the portion size... That had nothing to do with it. Then I had to wait another 20 minutes to get my food. No offer to refund the meal or anything. Very disappointed. The last and final time I went in was not as bad as an experience. Very slow to get the food but it was OK.

The waitress forgot one of the entrees for our table of four, so we stairs at each other for ten minutes and watched our food get cold while we waited.

Almost instantly after being seated, a friendly server came to the table. Her name was Stephanie. She explained the menu to us and made recommendations. We asked for shrimp cocktail which she was very sad to announce that they didn't have. She did offer to talk to the manager and the chef to ask if they could make it for us but we said that was ok.

Sara B.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",174,170,142,4.0,8/17/2008,"I went here as part of our company's quarterly luncheon. The service was good in the sense that the waitresses were friendly and constantly kept checking in on us to see if we needed refills.  I can't say much about the prices, since I honestly didn't look at them. I've been to the one in Elk Grove before, and I vaguely remember most entrees being around $10 or less, but I could be wrong. As for food, I decided to try something new this time and so, I ordered the fettuccine Alfredo with grilled chicken breast, which was very disappointing. I wanted something fattening, rich and creamy, but this dish just didn't meet my expectations on any level. It tasted way too bland and dry; I couldn't taste the creaminess of the sauce which Alfredo is known to possess.  On the plus side, their Pizookie is to die for! It's a warm and huge chewy cookie, that's topped with scoops of vanilla ice cream. You can get the cookie in chocolate chunk, white chocolate macadamia nut, peanut butter or oatmeal raisin walnut. I personally prefer the chocolate chunk one. I tried the Oreo Pizookie, but it was way too sweet. The wait time is usually super long; this time around it was okay since our company made reservations, but the one in Elk Grove is always packed and has long wait times. I can't say the same for this location, since the quarterly luncheon was the first time I went there, but most likely it's the same. All BJ Restaurants are pretty popular and well-known. Overall, it's a good place to eat, but next time I'll be sticking to the Great White Pizza that they have, which I usually order. Now THAT is pretty delicious!

Took a while to get seated, so I got to view some of the dinners coming out and I was all about the Asian salad, so that is what I ordered for dinner. It was a long wait, so we had an appetizer platter. It was pretty average, nothing really special. Then our dinner came out and I got this lame salad that was the size of a salad you have with your dinner. I felt as if they gave me the bottom of the barrel, what was barely left over and didn't want to take the time to make me something decent. It definitely did not look like the same salad these people got at the bar I was next to. I even asked them what salad it was. My sister ordered the same salad and it was the same issue and hardly any dressing on it. It took forever to get the waiter, we had to ask the water boy if he would get her for us. It took her a bit to get over to us and then we told her what was going on. She said she was ""sorry"" and I told her it wasn't her fault, but because we had to wait so long, I did not want my salad at all. She said she would go get us more dressing, but I told her again that the salad was not what we asked for. Then the manager comes over and asks if he can do anything for us and I said ""no thank you"", because the wait was a long time and I had lost my appetite. He explained they ran out of the fixings for the salads and that was why it was so small and he also said they were out of the dressing. I would had much rather they come out and tell us they were out of that type of salad and check and see if we'd like to order something else. What a bunch of BS. My g/f had the fried chicken. What a joke! Boxed mashed potatoes, canned corn and dried out fried chicken. It wasn't even hot! GROSS!!!!

Then we get the fritters after everything. She called the manager over, Tim Onion, he came to the table with a VERY defensive attitude about it all.  He would not back down about the steak not being even close to how it was cooked and just overall RUDE!

Marti A.,"CA, CA",0,14,,2.0,8/6/2015,"The oxymoron here is that BJ's, up until recently, would always get a 5 star review from us!  The lunch crowd gave us the first clue.  Usually, this restaurant is standing room only at lunch and dinner times.  Today it was, conspicuously, rather empty. In spite of the sparse lunch crowd, the first obvious difference was the slow service.  Then, we noticed the lack of condiments on the table.....only salt and pepper.  One must ask for sugar for iced tea, etc.  Finally, we placed our order. Mine,  (the lunch) Southern  fried chicken and my husband's, a small flat bread pizza with a salad.  The chicken was a small, thin and dry piece on top of a HUGE mound of potatoes with a small dollop of gravy.  This is accompanied by a corn mix scattered around the potatoes.  It was difficult to cut the chicken, it was so dry and hard.  The potatoes were tasty but dry without gravy to enhance them and the corn was like an afterthought. Usually, this is a small (but visible) piece of chicken on a small mound of potatoes on top of a nice portion of the corn mix.  The gravy usually drips down over the potatoes.  All very tasty!  The veggies compliment the chicken, potatoes and gravy as a Southern dish should.  The pepper gravy is so good that I always request a small side to augment the standard.  The lunch item I was served today made me feel as though we were in the wrong restaurant.....no comparison!  My husband's lunch was a small salad which was mostly slivered carrots, instead of lettuce, and his flat bread pizza was extremely greasy. Please know that we have had these items before and that they were delicious and well prepared.  We do not expect haute cuisine at BJ's but, we have always enjoyed the good service, outstanding food, atmosphere, camaraderie and reasonable prices which have all been consistent.  We are hoping that there has been a glitch in the system where, perhaps, the accountant decided to take over the BJ protocols? or, the CFO?  We fervently hope that whoever designed the ""NEW"" image for BJ's, has since been replaced with the old model!!  We would rather pay more and leave with a happy heart and a satisfied palate.  We plan to return before searching for a new favorite.  We are members of BJ's Premier Rewards and would like to keep this as our 'go to' standard.   Marti and Al",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-folsom?start=280

Horrible service, very unprofessional, you don't make reservations and then change your mind about reservations when the party is there. Who yells and argues with customers like that? In front of everyone in line and people at the tables were looking.

Cathy P.,"Portland, OR",464,382,5,4.0,1/24/2011,"Never been to a BJ's anywhere. Was visiting husband's family in Folsom (the city, not the Prison) and we went here for lunch after our 8 year old niece's basketball game. Very large, very noisy, but comfortable with a friendly waitstaff and real cloth napkins. I can't help it, I NOTICE these things. Kind of a sports-themed motif with some Hollywood thrown in is the best way to describe the interior.  Husband and I both ordered the halibut fish tacos but they had run out of halibut and were substituting cod. Great choice! Panko-crusted, perfectly fried fish wrapped in corn tortillas with chipotle mayonnaise, Santa Fe dressing, Napa cabbage, carrots, red onions and cilantro. Served with tortilla chips, avocado cream sauce and fire-roasted tomato salsa. To tell the truth, I thought the portion (2) was rather small and could have eaten one more but that's probably because I was starving and they were SO GOOD. A huge, the biggest baked potato I have ever seen (the size of a small dog. SRSLY) was ordered by my BIL and he managed to pack every bit of it away. Nephew had the pulled pork sandwich & french fries. It was also a huge portion. Little niece only eats pasta (yes, a real picky eater) and had the angel hair Toscana pasta and said it had too many tomatoes in it (she doesn't eat veggies) but it looked good to me. SIL had the Cuban burger. A half-pound burger served sandwich-style, topped with oven-roasted ham, Swiss cheese, crispy dill pickles, Dijonnaise and mustard and of course, lots of french fries. Everyone but me and the kiddlings had beer. The Piranha Pale Ale and Jeremiah Red were the big hits.  I know this goes against everything the media says about putting calorie count info on menus, but I was really appreciative that BJ's made this info available. I did use the calorie counts of a few dishes in making my final choice; it wasn' t the ONLY deciding factor but it was one of them.  BJ's has the biggest menu, as in pages, I've ever seen. It was almost nauseating turning all the pages. Everything from pizza, salads, sandwiches, burgers, pasta, to desserts. Let me tell you, if you can't find something to eat here, you won't find it anywhere else! Not fine cuisine but not fast food either. I nice place to spend some time with family or friends.

Christine W.,"Folsom, CA",32,7,,1.0,8/7/2013,"This was our second attempt and giving BJ's another try. My husband & I had brought my brother and his wife here about a month ago to try for the first time. The food was good but the service was HORRIBLE!  Thinking it was because it was dinner time we would give it another try.  This time my husband, myself and & his bff went for lunch last Friday. We arrived at 1:15pm waited 10 mins to be seated. Not bad. However we sat another 10-15 mins before our waitress ""stopped by"" to get our drink order. At the time we ordered our drinks we ordered chips and salsa too. Our drinks came out pretty quickly however  We again waited another 10-15 mins for chips & salsa to arrive.  There was 3 adults eating and she brings up a small bowl of salsa with not alot of chips.  Instead of taking our order then, she dropped off our chips and left. Finally another 10-15 mins later she decided to stop off at our table to take our order. By this time we had finished off our chips and salsa and asked for more. After about 5 mins and seeing her walk by our table and not saying anything I caught her atten to asked our out salsa & chips. She said they ran out and had to make more..... Our orders were pretty simple, a salad, sandwich and the BBQ special you have currently going on. We waited another 15-20 mins before our meals were brought out by someone other than our waitress. Still no salsa or chips. I said something to the gal who brought out our food.  She seemed surprised when I told her we were still waiting for fresh salsa to come out as our waitress said they ran out. Amazingly she left and was back in less then 2 mins with fresh salsa & chips. By this time we now had our food and wasn't hungry for the chips & salsa. But at $5.99 for a cup of salsa and a small about of chips, you bet I'm asking for seconds. What a rip off!!  Only saving grace was the salsa was pretty good.  After receiving our food we waiting another 10 mins before she stopped by to see how our food was and if we needed anything else. That was pretty much the last time we saw here except to walk by our table to help others tables around her.  Finally I caught her atten to ask for our check. It was closed to 3pm and we wanted out of there!  2 hrs for lunch???  Really??  When I asked for the check nicely she gave me a look  and said ""I was just going to ask you if you want and dessert?"" with attitude. REALLY???  It was all my husband could do to keep me calm We felt like she didnt' think we were good enough to dine in this resturant.  Don't worry this will be the LAST time we eat there!

Ethan H.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",0,1,,4.0,5/18/2013,"Summary:  Today (5/18/12) I went with my family to the local BJ's. The hostess was very kind though we had to wait 30 minutes (no reservation). Once we were seated, the waitress immediately started us off with some drinks. The raspberry lemonade was amazing. Food:  For the appetizer, we got the ""onion strings"" which were much better than onion rings. They are lightly breaded and not to oily. My daughter got the spaghetti and meat sauce which she said was very good. The shrimp scampi was a little less flavorful but still decent. I also got a tomato bisque which had just the perfect blend of flavor and creaminess. For dessert we shared a pizookie which is to die for.  Service:  The hostess was very kind and politely told us to wait for our table 30 min and was exactly that. The waitress quickly to our drink orders and came back 5 min. later to take our orders. After we got our food, the waitress came back multiple times to check on us and was a very kind young lady.  Overall: The food was pretty good while the service we received was amazing.

Waitress at the next table lost half of the steak fries on the floor and completely ignoring the fact by serving the dish anyway. 2. Another young waitress bringing a house salad and nachos to our table when we hadn't even ordered. 3. Wait staff standing around looking completely flustered and lost. As for our meal, it wasn't much better....dirty silverware, luke warm soup that was poured into a bowl from a small silver urn (huh?), and a house salad (that we did actually order) drowning and wilting in ranch dressing. My Jalapeno Burger was bland and woefully overcooked and burnt on the edges, and our food was brought to us by not the server who took our order, but by three different servers who magically appeared out of nowhere complete with lousy attitudes.

Other dishes, I haven't touched because of the price point. I can't justify paying to much, when the menu does not convince.

Dianne H.,"Placerville, CA",2,23,,1.0,5/4/2012,"Went there with a friend and chose the half baked potatoe and salad. Well let me tell you first of all it says it is half of their giant baked potato. I've seen their giant baked potato and what I got was not even close to ""half"" of that. In fact it was a half of a medium potato, flat as a pancake and not fluffy like a baked potato should be, that told me that it was probably left over from the night before or had been sitting in a warming oven for some time. Okay, next--I ordered it with sour cream and butter and the waitress said well for a few dollars more you can get cheese and bacon on it. The bacon consisted of about 4 chopped up pieces and the cheese was like yellow gooey glue, not in the least bit appetizing. The salad was your garden variety ""pale leaf"" lettuce with a few sliced tomatoes and not much else. Iced tea $2.75. Lunch with tip ended up costing $15.00, a far cry from the $5.95 that I had intended to spend. Well not  their fault as they did not force me to order the iced tea. It could have been so good had the potato really been ""half"" of their ""giant"" one and if it had been fluffy and had not had a glutenous mess of cheese on it. I have been to the BJ's in Elk Grove, what a difference as that one in Elk Grove served up this same dish wonderfully.

We ordered their nachos as an appetizer for the five of us and were pleasantly pleased by not only the size, but the taste.  I ordered one of their heffe-weizens and was reminded of sipping those heady beers in German Gausthauses while stationed there.  The only thing missing was the slice of lemon, which I stole from a friend's iced tea - she never even missed it. The menu was a little eclectic with some of everything included.  Two people ordered personal pizzas which they were pleased with and I ordered the pot roast sandwich.  Imagine a huge helping of tender pot roast beef, served open faced on bread, and topped off with mashed potatoes and gravy!  My arteries are clogging as I type this, but it was great! After the main courses were done it came time for desert but we were all so full, we decided to share.  We ordered this brownie creation topped with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, and chocolate sauce!  The brownie was warm and served in the same pan it was baked in.  As the five spoons tore through the mountain if ice cream and whipped cream, the entire thing quickly disappeared.

Our food took a little longer than usual to arrive. My friend who ordered the salad was kindly greeted with a plate of lettuce and chicken devoid of any utensils. I'm sure that made him 2nd guess not ordering finger food. And my two mini pizza's arrived uncut...I assume they were trying a pazookie style that night..

There regular menu is good too, but the happy hour menu is to good to pay full price. I normally get a pepperoni mini pizza, and a salad. Sometimes Ill get another mini to go since there so cheap. The only down side to eating happy hour is theres not many tables available, so if you want to get a seat u have to stand around and wait for someone to get up. They also brew their own beer. I recommend the hefeweizen. I got a keg of it a couple years ago for my wifes b-day. It was only like $100 and its the best hefeweizen ive ever had.

So i paid $5 for a cookie.  I felt that the staff got lazy and didnt double check my order like responsible staff should.

It's one of those places that no matter who you bring here, I would wager that most anyone can find something on the menu that they are going to like. We came here on a Saturday night, it was fairly busy but we were sat immediately. We ordered an appetizer and two entrees. The food came really quickly and was good. One complaint: we had to wait for refills on our iced teas several times... even though we invited her to leave behind a pitcher of iced tea... OK, we more than invited, we ASKED her to leave a pitcher behind but she said she wasn't allowed. What? That's just silly. That is the first time I have ever heard of such a ridiculous rule.

After finishing our meal, which was good as expected, we ordered dessert... big mistake. True story - it took them nearly twenty minutes to bring one dessert, and ten minutes to get our check, with our server nowhere in sight.

I didn't want to believe the bad bits - prefer to experience a place myself without expectations. The reviews were all accurate some good service, some bad service. The food is good but, service was very slow, and we needed to keep asking the wait staff to come back because orders were missed for entrees, drinks, dessert. The same person took our orders, but would disappear before taking all the orders. Don't know if he got distracted or ? One order was forgotten and one order was incorrect, so two in our party waited while their orders were filled, but the rest of us had our food. At least two of the hot entrees were brought cold. I said at one point, maybe the staff was busy and three people next to me all said in unision, ""No, they're not.""

There was no one else waiting to be seated, wait staff passed by us, no one acknowledged us, another hostess joined the counter and we still stood there.  I overheard someone from the wait staff tell one of the hostesses that there was a table requesting to speak to a manager, we continued to wait, not sure what the holdup was for. About 10 minutes after we'd arrived, the second hostess told the first hostess (who had greeted us) that she should probably seat us; wow, what a concept; guess she couldn't figure that out on her own. Finally we were walked to our table.  We sat down and waited for someone to come take or order.  There were about 5 or 6 wait staff working, and we were passed by some of them several times but no one greeted us, no one even made eye contact.
