Jim P.,"Chanhassen, MN",1,68,7,3.0,8/12/2017,I had three opportunities to eat here and it was definitely a contrast to say the least.   First time we came for lunch.  I got the soup in the bread bowl and it was very good for a casual feeder but below par for top tier restaurants. Service was good and the place was clean as it is new. The menu is diverse.  Second time was for dinner. I can't remember the last time I saw a clusterf*** as this meal.  Service was great but it ended there.  The appetizer came out with loads of salt (and I like salt) and when we complained to the manager he attempted to tell us that a deep fried appetizer is pre salted on the outside. He brought another one out which was fine. My friends mixed drink had no alcohol in it. My other friend's meal arrived in three stages. This was a total fail and I can't remember some of the other stuff that was done.  Third time was for dinner. Service was on par and the food quality also improved.  I would pass until the opening dies down.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fort-wayne-2?start=20
Cw M.,"Fort Wayne, IN",1,10,16,3.0,9/14/2017,"Really loud and unexceptional. A large fast-casual, Appleby's on a grander scale. My flatbread pizza was great, the service was very good, the setting was good, the decor was good, my large group was seated fairly quickly and by staff members that seemed very concerned that we not have to wait long (thank you, again)....so you might be thinking, why 3 stars? This restaurant format, with the exposed wood tables, metal walls, stone, etc just seems to amplify sound. TV's are on (often muted, because who can hear them?) People are trying to talk over the echoed din of the crowd and there is nothing to absorb the cacophony until your ears are ringing. I had a group of 9 people, and you could maybe talk to the nearest 4, and just barely that. This place is a solid 4.5 if you were dining alone with earplugs, and could be a 5 with time, but this is not a place to socialize unless you can shout into your friend's ear. The prices are a little on the higher end for this format, but there were lots of choices that looked really intriguing. With the giant barn building shape, I have no idea what they could do to wrangle the noise level.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fort-wayne-2?start=20
Londa T.,"Matteson, IL",0,3,6,5.0,8/1/2017,"Its really good!  The decor is appealing to the eye.  We had the avocado rolls, cherry Chipotle wings and the deep dish Mediterranean pizza.

Tyler S.,"Fort Wayne, IN",44,9,,5.0,6/18/2017,"2nd visit: Drinks: Jeremiah Red, Berry Jerry, Nitwit, and Watermelon Mojito; all delicious. Appetizer: Ultimate Pepperoni Flatbread; a really yummy thin crust that wasn't crunchy or cracker-like, very good Entrees: Shrimp and Arugula Pita tacos; came with a quinoa, tomato, corn and onion salsa, the shredded Parmesan cheese kinda took over, but it was good, too. Half-rack of ribs with clam chowder and tomato & mozzarella salad; the ribs were really excellent, especially if you like to ""kick it up a notch"" as I do, the chowder and salad were decent. Overall: Gave me pint glass that read: ""Happy Father's Day 2017"" with a card to get 20% off over the next 3 weeks...we'll be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fort-wayne-2?start=20
Patrick T.,"Fort Wayne, IN",123,8,2,5.0,7/7/2017,Absolutely fantastic food and service! Called ahead on a Friday night and we were seated in less than 15 min! Ordered the Prime Rib Special and it was fantastic! It came with 2 sides and a salad which were also very good. Plenty of food for the price!

Dale B.,"Fort Wayne, IN",394,178,,5.0,5/28/2017,we've been to BJ's two times and loved it each time.  Get the app for your phone.  The free appetizer is worth it.  The best part is being able to call ahead and reserve a spot.  The interior is very welcoming and fun.  Not sure I understand the garage doors inside though.  The bar area is a comfortable place to sit as well. We have tried multiple things from salads to sandwiches to appetizers to pizza.  All have been good every time.  The menu is HUGE!!  The service is committed to making things right.  We've been a couple times during the training/opening period.  So things were a little crazy...but well worth the visits!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fort-wayne-2?start=20
Barry V.,"Fort Wayne, IN",0,7,9,5.0,5/8/2017,"We went to BJ's Brewhouse over the lunch hour on a Friday. At 11:45 AM it was already packed. We tried the Spinach Artichoke dip as an appetizer. Chips were hot and crisp and the dip was flavorful.  For lunch, I had the hot ham and cheese with fries. The outside of the sandwich was grilled with Parmesan for a crusty cheese coating that was strong but tasty. My wife tried the BJ burger with bacon and I got to taste it...really good burger! My son tried the Chicken Bacon Ranch Piadini. He thought it was okay but he probably wouldn't get it again.  The staff is friendly and efficient. I set up the BJ Brewhouse app and paid from my phone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fort-wayne-2?start=20

Corinne S.,"Fort Wayne, IN",107,35,55,2.0,8/4/2017,"Unfortunately our first experience here was so terrible, I can't ever see myself going back... Ambiance: Atmosphere and decor are impressive. Probably the best thing about this place.  Service: TERRIBLE. Being a server myself, I completely understand when a server gets overwhelmed on a busy night with too many tables. She was also training someone, which doesn't help. BUT, BUT, BUT! it's all about how you handle the situation! If service is slow, or things get messed up, you APOLOGIZE and GET THE MANAGER. Our server brought me food that had cheese on it after assuring me that it was vegan. I understood she made a mistake before I ate it, and I ordered something else. But what REALLY UPSET us was how my friend's food was handled. She's a vegetarian. Asked for the vegetarian burger. GOT SERVED A REAL BEEF BURGER!!! She took a few bites before realizing it was the wrong patty. (Needless to say, she was puking in the toilet the rest of the night.) Now again, I understand that could be the kitchen, or expediter's mistake...but everything was handled completely WRONG. I'm telling you, it's all about how you handle a situation... We never saw a manager until the very end. Especially when a restaurant first opens, managers should be checking in with EVERY table to make sure guests are happy. The burger was still on my friend's check. Then the server looked confused when my friend wanted it taken off the bill. THAT SHOULD BE A GIVEN. Finally the manager came over, and was not apologetic in the least.  I still tipped the server well cause I couldn't bring myself to leave a bad tip, especially when I'm sure the rest of the table probably stiffed her... but the whole experience was a huge disaster, that could have been avoided if it just would have been handled better. Food: Lots of options. Drinks: I did enjoy the draft brews. Prices: Standard. Parking: All around the building. ***My friend did complain to corporate, and we received a $200 gift card as an incentive to give the place another try, but as far as I know, no one has used it yet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fort-wayne-2?start=20
Danielle C.,"Fort Wayne, IN",61,4,2,3.0,6/7/2017,"Ate here for lunch, I ordered the shrimp tacos but got tacos that I wasn't expecting.

Bob E.,"Fort Wayne, IN",5,48,,3.0,4/16/2017,"Stopped in this last Saturday. Just opened a week ago, and it was busy. Inside is smaller than it appears from the outside. Huge menu. We tried a flatbread, and it was decent. the wife had a salmon salad, and I had an Ahi Tuna salad, both had nice fresh greens, but were just okay, and over priced. Salmon was a little overcooked, and the Ahi portion was small. The house beers were on a par with Granite City, (average at best) if that's what you are into. They did have a decent selection of guest taps. Beer prices were also a little high. Service was friendly, if a bit uncertain. Two members of management stopped by to chat briefly. Due to the great location the place should do well. Probably won't make my regular rotation, but would not be opposed to returning.

Tori S.,"Fort Wayne, IN",7,38,49,5.0,6/23/2017,"I've been to BJs a few times and have yet to be disappointed! We love the beer sampler! It is not as ""classy"" as Granite City nor as expensive, so I actually like that! I feel Granite City out prices themselves.  If I want a classy experience and a good steak that's what I have Club Soda for! *truth* Where as BJs hit it right on! If you want to try a verity of things get the appetizer sampler (you will love the egg rolls) and a beer sampler! Such a great first date thing to do and place to go! My boyfriend and I both said that we wish we could have gone here. Light energy, easy, and fun! The portions are perfect even on the appetizers.

Sarah C.,"Lake Forest, Fort Wayne, IN",28,16,9,3.0,8/17/2017,"First time here for dinner and the service was decent. Whoever was in the kitchen had a love affair with pepper. From my brothers spaghetti, to the steaks, and mixed veggies it was all heavily peppered. There was nothing memorable about BJs to make me want to come back.

Anita H.,"Germantown, WI",2,14,,5.0,6/8/2017,"Visited while in Ft. Wayne for a basketball tournament. First visit was for lunch with a group of 12, encompassing multiple families. We had such a great experience that we came back the next day - again a group of 12, but a somewhat different mix of guests. Here's why we loved BJ's: - Large menu with lots of variety. Not only was there something for everyone, most had a hard time choosing from the multiple items that looked good at the time. - Kid friendly - Great service. The order system sends orders in real-time. For example, on the first day, our server began taking drink orders. About half way through, we realized that due to time constraints we should probably put in our food orders right away, so she came back around and started taking food orders without leaving our table. While she was taking food orders, servers began to appear with our drinks! - When food was delivered, several servers came out making it a quick, efficient process for feeding a large group. - Multiple families were easily and cheerfully accommodated at the end, by breaking into separate bills via seat number. - Throughout the meal, servers were attentive keeping drinks refilled, and making sure we had everything needed. - And I shouldn't gloss over the fact that the food was good! The only meal that one of our guests had that was described as ""average"" was a chicken Cesar salad. All other guests enjoyed their food choice. Ditto for the local brews. Please come to Germantown, WI - we need a place just like this!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fort-wayne-2?start=20
Samantha S.,"Fort Wayne, IN",79,5,,1.0,8/5/2017,"Bad service. Okay food. It took us a half out to get our drinks  and it wasn't too busy at 11:00 pm. We ordered a beer and a non alcoholic cucumber drink on the menu, which no one on staff knew how to make. The calamari was okay. The server kept blaming coworkers for her bad service. Unprofessional. Taking orders on the tablets took forever and the server was rushing to find things and kept ringing in the wrong items.

Gs1 S.,"Roanoke, IN",4,59,1,5.0,6/18/2017,"I had low expectations of this place, because it looks like another Friday's/Chilis/Applebees, etc. The place is well-decorated and very open.  The menu is huge, too big in my opinion, but you're almost guaranteed to find something you want.  We ordered the Brewhouse blond asparagus, which is basically deep fried asparagus. It was great, and was free with a download. The draft beer menu is also large.  They have their own line of crafted beers, as well as a great variety of others.  We ordered pizza and the parmesan crusted chicken.  Both were excellent!! The service was excellent as well. The only negative is that the server didn't give us the appetizer for free like it was supposed to be. We didn't even bring it up, as she was so nice, and it didn't cost that much.  We'll download it next time, because there will definitely be a next time. This place should put Chili's out of business within a year.  Highly recommend this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fort-wayne-2?start=60

Amanda W.,"Fort Wayne, IN",5,13,2,3.0,4/18/2017,"It wasn't a terrible experience. Just very confusing from the start. The fact that no names are taken at the hostess station seemed a little odd to me. How do the hosts keep people in the queue straight? And why did I have to wait 5-10 minutes for a table at 11am when there was a full staff and plenty of empty tables? (I used to work in a very busy restaurant, and this floored me. The hosts are the first and last faces guests see, they can make or break the experience. Maybe it wasn't their fault names aren't taken, but in my past experiences, taking down names is the best way to go to keep order.) I was asked how many were in my party a second time, and it appeared I'd be seated then. I was told I would not be seated just yet. But when it was time, I nearly missed it because I wasn't informed. Someone just walked up to me and said, ""Party of 2? Right this way."" When I was seated, it took a few minutes before a server got to my table, which is fine because the menu is 20 pages long, and far too many choices. (Kudos to all of you servers who know it by heart!)  When our server did arrive, he was very friendly and knowledgeable. My sister and I both ordered a grilled ham and cheese with tomato basil soup. She also ordered a strawberry mojito (which was more expensive than our meal). The soup came out before the meal, but we ordered the soup as a substitute for french fries. They should have come together, I thought. We still had fries on our plate (which was fine, we didn't have to eat them.) The food itself was average. Nothing to write home about. I was a little overwhelmed with how many people came to the table to refill water, deliver our food, remove our plates, and bring boxes. And it seemed as though some of the staff just 'hovered' in the walk ways. Too many people just standing around. It was nearly impossible to have a conversation with so many people. We also had a bit of a wait to get our bill receipts after our server ran the cards on his handheld device. The devices were really neat, however, because he could order our food from them, print our ticket to the printer, and run our cards on them. The price for our meals themselves were reasonable for what we ordered. I *may* try this place again after a few months of them being in service. I know it takes a while for new places to get their stuff together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fort-wayne-2?start=60

Server didn't check up on us at all or even go near us to see if we needed anything (we needed ketchup and drink refills lol) by the time we did get refills we had the checks brought out to us and everyone was already done.

Tracy E.,"Harrison Hill, Fort Wayne, IN",36,3,5,2.0,5/2/2017,"So unimpressed with this restaurant! We have been twice and the food is average at best! The music was so loud I couldn't hear my husband at dinner but could hear everything the booth behind me was saying because they were screaming to hear each other. If I wanted to go to a rock concert I would have went to the Coliseum. My jumbo spaghetti and meatballs were not even close to jumbo the meatballs were the size of a ping pong ball and I am being generous saying that. My husbands baked ziti was undercooked and not even hot. He ordered the Ahi tuna salad to replace it and it was missing the avocado. The other thing I totally don't get is why 10 people came to our table. I have been a server for 15 years I understand having someone run your food for you or get you a refill on your drink but not having so many people come to your table.

Allyssa B.,"Fort Wayne, IN",0,1,,2.0,8/1/2017,"From start to finish this experience was completely disappointing. When we arrived the hostess sat us and informed us our server would be with us shortly. A few minutes later a young lady greeted us, handed us menus, and told us our server would be with us shortly. Then the real server arrived and asked us if the lady who provided us with menus got our drink order. She did not. I ordered a cheeseburger well done, cheese only and my boyfriend ordered the wings. When our food arrived it was delivered by yet another person other than our server and who was a different woman than the woman who greeted us with menus. I instantly noticed that my burger was prepared with lettuce and tomato and quickly picked it off. I was going to let it slide until I noticed it also had mayonnaise and some orangish colored sauce as well. I politely reminded her that I ordered cheese only. She looked at the receipt as if I were lying and then questioned whether or not I wanted it remade. I told her I did. Within one minute she returned the burger to me with the same plate, fries, picked off lettuce and tomato, and burger with mayonnaise and orangish sauce soaked into the burger. First of all I used to be a server and as a server you need to take into account not only presentation but also people's allergies. My boyfriend at this point was just as annoyed as I was and asked her how the burger was remade so quickly. She admitted they only swapped out the bun (as if it wasn't evident) and then made an excuse on how that's ""just what they do."" We asked for a new burger and she took the plate away. Then finally my true server brought out a new burger and plate, but didn't care to give me the fries. We literally had to ask for a side of fries! The only good thing I experienced there was they have 1/2 wine by the glass or bottle on Tuesday. Other than that, I was completely disappointed and don't know if I'll return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fort-wayne-2?start=60
Byron H.,"Rome City, IN",0,5,,1.0,4/29/2017,"We decided to try BJs for the first time Thursday evening. It ended up being a terrible experience. Once we sat ourselves in the bar area it took nearly 10 mins to even place a drink order that took another 10 to get.  We only saw our waiter one time when he took our order. They have a weird way of waiting on tables. They try to send multiple people with food, and drinks. They just lose the customer attention and customer service in the process. The were several waitresses that were very helpful and could see our frustration in our waiter. I did not catch his name or I would put it on here, but he was taller, skinny, younger guy with black hair. Anyway. We were hoping for a great experience and left very disappointed. I felt awful for leaving a $2 tip on a $45 bill, but that was honestly generous compared to the service we received. As for our food. It was very bland. I had the French Dip slider which was Luke warm at best.  And it was $14. It could have been sold in a gas station for $2.99.

Service: hit or miss.  I came one time and the service was not good at all. Not friendly and seemed like they didn't want to be there.  The next time she was smiley and friendly.

I really loved how accomidating they were with the request of no butter and etc for sus being vegan.   Food: being vegan this place has a few choices to pick.  I got the qinue bowl and it was super super good.  We got an artochike appitizer which was delicious but,  be sure to order with no cheese if you are vegan.  My partner got the cauliflower tacos and those were also an amazing choice.  All ordered with no cheese.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fort-wayne-2
Danielle C.,"Fort Wayne, IN",6,85,18,1.0,12/28/2017,"I have dined here twice since they opened. Different days of the week and at different times. I'm sad to report both times were horrendous and I left the restaurant disappointed. I really want to like this place and dine here in the future but given a staff that doesn't seem to care once you're seated and management not around to discuss the tables mishaps and us having to flag down any other staff member that walked passed us and had the guts to look at us so we could corral them to our table Justifies that I cannot go back nor leave an upbeat kudos review. The first time we had a party of 12 for a Christmas Office dinner that was paid for by the company. 7 of us ordered the rib special that came with a full rack of ribs, salad, two sides and a dessert. They ran out of ribs, baked potato and some vegetables. Instead of coming to the table to notify the guest and ask what they'd like instead they took it upon themselves to replace items they didn't have with what they chose. Umm why?  Adult beverages took 15' to come out if at all, desserts weren't delivered to everyone that ordered their famous pizzookies and water or drink refills never happened. Management was flagged down at the this visit and the owners were given a huge stack of gift cards for the issues. Ok so the second trip had to prove better since it was earlier in the week earlier time and a party of four, right?  WRONG!!  I Called ahead for seating and still endured a 20' wait when we got there, once sat it just went downhill from there. Our server was friendly and got our drinks out in a timely matter so I'll give him that. But after that randy failed on every level. Drinks were never refilled unless I flagged him or someone down, our food took 30' until Randy came to our table and said ""hmmm I wonder where your food is!""   5' later it came out.....cold and you could tell it sat on the kitchen line for awhile. Two of the meals were prepared wrong, missing items and one hamburger was so well done it was dry and inedible. Don't worry we never saw randy again to tell him any of this but the hostess and other staff members retrieved our missing items and at least got us hot fries which was my meal that night since my hamburger was a hockey puck that I ordered med but came out well. Randy wasn't to be seen again in till he brought the check and even when we asked for boxes to take all of our food home he still was clueless. Yep, you guessed it not manager to be seen to let them know so we could at least get a decent burger remade. But my trash can loved it!  It thanked me for it!   For a Place that opened up a few months ago I'd have thought the kinks would be worked out but it appears that they aren't. Which is to bad, I really wanted to like this place. I want to go and have beer and burgers but unless a miracle happens I just won't be back.  Other than that the establishment is very cool. The brick and lighting as well as the decorations prove to be popular with everyone. It can be noisy but that makes it all part of the experience. It's more of a Brewhouse so if you're expecting to have your grandpas birthday party dinner here be prepared to experience a fun atmosphere with little noise muffling happening. It's also very busy so I would suggest taking part of the call ahead seating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fort-wayne-2

Got a kids pizza and honestly it was no better than Pizza Hut, again nothing great just average. I know they have their own beer but I did not partake this time.

Joe S.,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",0,6,2,3.0,10/21/2017,"I'm just going to get to it. First off the pizza was good the crust was actually good for thick crust (light and airy). For that I'll say it was good.  Now when I called to order I ask specifically if it was a true Chicago deep dish and not thick crust. I was told yes. Not true though as stated above. So I have looked up the definition of Chicago deep dish. See below.  Chicago-style pizza usually refers to deep-dish pizza, which is a thick pizza baked in a pan and layered with cheese, fillings like meat and vegetables, and sauce, in that order. The crust is usually 2-3 inches tall and gets slightly fried due to the oil in the pan.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fort-wayne-2

Cassandra C.,"Fort Wayne, IN",31,44,60,4.0,4/18/2017,"So the bf and I decided to give this place a try since we had a coupon  and we'd never been to a BJ's.  So first of all Monday is a half priced pizza day, so be ready for the kitchen to be slow and secondly they have $5 margaritas on special too. The menu is highly confusing... it jumps around so much I flipped through about 6 times.  We decided against a pizza and instead wanted to try a bit of everything. We ordered the mozzarella sticks as the app, he ordered the French dip with a bowl of chili and I ordered a bowl of clam chowder and a mahi mahi taco and shrimp taco.  So my bf got his chili within 5 min or so of us ordering, I got mine after our food came. Our app was delivered after we were finished eating and had been waiting on our boxes.  Besides the service lacking, and I don't mean just server ..... we never saw the manager, the kitchen obviously dropped the ball and out server was distracted by a table demanding free stuff.. the food was really good. I love soups and both the chili and chowder were good enough to bring me back. My boyfriend loved his French dip and raved about how it didn't even need the dip. My tacos were good too, a little heavy on the sauce side. Really they just needed cilantro and lime juice . All in all we would go again.

He had the Penne with Asparagus.  It had no flavor and kept adding salt, pepper and hot sauce.  We'd been traveling all morning from  Kentucky and were hungry, so this was such a disappointment.  The bartender asked if I wanted a box.  I declined, not even my teen boy would've eaten it and if you have teen boys, you know they demolish leftovers.  I didn't say anything other than no thank you, on the box.  BUT.....with 3/4 of my food left plated why wouldn't he ask if everything was ok?  Clearly it wasn't.  For crap service dude, enjoy your 9 cent tip.  My husband NEVER does that, I guess there is always a first.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fort-wayne-2

I ordered the Atlantic salmon with broccoli and it was really really tasteful.

I sent it back and they gave me another pizza free of charge. They were nice about it and the new pizza looked much better but it seriously wasn't even good .... it was basically pizza hut pizza . I wish I ordered the thin crust like the people next to me, but I thought that's all they had so I didn't realize I was going to get a thick crust. I wish the server had asked what crust I wanted.

They had a lot of low calorie options, but I got the Barbacoa Chicken. For 520 calories, I was very impressed with how flavorful and delicious the entree was.

Lots of different choices for whatever you might fancy that day. For apps, we got calamari and the California club flatbread. Both highly recommended. My family all got burgers because on Wednesdays they have $10 loaded burgers and endless fries. I had the bacon guacamole burger which was juicy and flavorful. My girlfriend had the BBQ bison burger which was also delicious. And the endless fries, well it was unfortunate that I could only eat one refill because they are bomb. Crispy and potato-y.  Service was pretty good. For it being so busy and brand new to Fort Wayne, we got our food and drinks in pretty good time and the staff was prepared.

They have a feature where they notify you of your table being ready via text message (which allowed us to hang out in the comfort of our car to pass the time). 2. Guests who chose to stand at the front of the restaurant were offered refreshments/small snacks to make the wait less awful. 3. The customer service was superb.

Sally Albright _.,"Fort Wayne, IN",0,58,,1.0,5/30/2017,"We always love to try new restaurants that pop up in the Fort--my home since birth--so, of course, we headed on over to Bj's to see what it was all about. Our answer? Inedible food, mediocre service, and unreasonably long wait times. After using call head seating (we were seated immediately upon arrival), we waited over an hour for our food. and we spent much of that time sitting in our booth with empty glasses, waiting for drink refills from a waitress who rarely showed up.  Even the beautiful dining room (and, it is really gorgeous) didn't take the sting of an hour-long wait after 8pm on a weeknight for food that was stone cold when it arrived. Our mozzarella stick appetizer was disgusting. It was bland, lukewarm, and had a faint burnt taste to it, even though none of the breading was actually  burnt. For our main course, we ordered an (overpriced) signature deep dish pizza and a tavern cut flatbread for the table. The toppings were anything but fresh and flavorful. The cheese wasn't warm and gooey, but cold and a bit hard, even though the deep dish pizza was still in its pan. This made me wonder how long we'd been waiting for food that was waiting for us, while our waitress did side work in the form of busing other tables and rolling silverware (seriously!).  The deep dish pizza crust was woefully underdone, causing us to stop eating after the first bite. We would've sent it back to be cooked more or replaced, but we were told that could be another 30-40 minute wait--not worth it. The flatbread was even more tragic, and its crust resembled unleavened dough (dough made without yeast, or without having been given the chance to rise at all). It was clear that the kitchen staff had no idea what they were doing. We asked to speak to the manager, and he finally appeared another 20 minutes later. He was truly apologetic, and offered dessert on the house in addition to comping our inedible meal. We took their signature dessert to go, and it would've been good (pizookies in two varieties), if not for the fact that the cookies were horribly burnt.  Neither the hostess who seated us, nor our waitress, could give any food recommendations because ""the menu's so big, and I haven't worked here long, so I haven't really tried anything.""

Patty N.,"Fort Wayne, IN",21,145,14,4.0,5/30/2017,"We went here on a Saturday night at 8:00.  I called ahead, but still had to wait about 45 minutes.  That's ok - it's a Saturday night.  The 3 in our party all got the same thing.  We wanted to try different items, but the prime rib deal was so good - we couldn't pass it up.  A large portion of prime rib, soup or salad, 2 sides AND a pizookie for dessert was only $27.00.  What a deal!  We also got the free appetizer for signing up online.  The meal was very, very good and the pizookie?  Awesome.  We got the tomato soup, clam chowder and broccoli cheese with our meals instead of salads - they were really good.  The prime rib was cooked perfectly and had great flavor.  The green beans as a side were really spicey - won't order those again, but the asparagus was good, but a little spicey as well.  The cheddar mashed were good.  Service was very friendly and helpful.  We will be back - can't wait!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fort-wayne-2?start=40
