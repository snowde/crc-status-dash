Johnson T.,"Baltimore, MD",87,42,26,4.0,12/30/2017,"Great place to meet your friends, tinder date, or possibly, your future hubby. The atmosphere is great, you can easily ghost away from your horrible date or sit back and slam some beers back with your bffs during game night.  I was in there for a total of about 10 minutes. I met with a couple friends who have already stuffed their faces and were ready to leave. I managed to try out their lager, which was not too appealing to my taste. Great part of my experience was the bartender. I told her the flavor was not that great and she swapped it out for their Hefeweizen. The Hefeweizen is actually pretty damn good. I would give them a try though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-frederick
Rachel S.,"Martinsburg, WV",10,21,,1.0,1/10/2018,"Some of the worst food I've had. I ordered the clam chowder and there was so much flour in it that there were chunks of it and it gelatinized after about a minute. Came out luke warm and in an absurdly shallow dish for an EIGHT DOLLAR ""bowl"". I've been to high end restaurants that charge that. Not crap places at a mall.  Then I had the Great White (?) deep dish mini. Apparently they don't get that deep dish means the toppings are deep, not that the bread is 2"" thick with a dusting of toppings. It tasted like a Dominos breadstick dipped in their garlic sauce. Exactly like that.  Horribly disappointing. Won't return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-frederick
Keisha C.,"Frederick, MD",7,50,33,5.0,12/13/2017,"I've been here twice with my best cousin whenever she comes up from PG County.  The hostesses are very friendly from the moment you walk in through the revolving doors, and they hand you menus and take you to any seat of your choice. To me, the environment of the restaurant is good. The restaurant's lighting is a bit dark, but I like it. As for the waitresses, they're very friendly and they make sure that everything is good to your liking. I usually get the half rack of ribs with the Caesar salad and fries, or I just get green beans if I don't want the fries.  I have to admit that the food is a little bit pricey, but totally worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-frederick
Alice G.,"Denver, CO",1272,1030,2083,3.0,11/14/2017,"Overstimulation! TVs, music, high ceiling! Fun good energy on a Friday night. We started off with a couple of drinks in the bar, and the flatbread nachos which were yummy and delicious. Probably enough for a meal.  I tried the seared Ahi salad where there were tiny little squares of tuna in a big big giant bowl of greens. I don't think there was much value or protein in this meal. Daughter had the salmon in cherry glaze and fared much better. Nice suburban dining for Friday night!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-frederick
Meagan P.,"Middletown, MD",142,136,200,5.0,9/24/2017,"BJ's not only has a massive menu and delicious food; they have fantastic service and a great happy hour as well! My favorite thing about this place is that I can order something different every single time. Seriously, their menu reminds me of the Cheesecake Factory...endless choices!  My most recent visit was on a Friday evening around 6:00. Their happy hour stretches from 3:00 to 7:00, and I was pleased to see their handcrafted beers were on special for $4. They also have select appetizers for $6 (I would recommend the spinach and artichoke dip). If you're looking for one of their craft brews, I would recommend their amber ale, the Jeremiah Red.  I ordered the Lemon Thyme Chicken for $13.50, and boy was it amazing. It was seasoned wonderfully and the rice was flavorful and delicious. Finally, you HAVE to try their Pizookie dessert. They have a variety of options, but the s'mores is my favorite. I normally don't order dessert at restaurants, but I always save room for this dish. It has a chocolatey base topped with warm peanut butter, toasted marshmallows, and a generous scoop of vanilla ice cream. It is delicious!  Finally, the service here is awesome. Our waiter, Mark, was funny, friendly, and attentive the entire time. There was a problem with my bill and he was apologetic and quick to fix it.  You can't go wrong with BJ's. I always look forward to dining here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-frederick
Brittany H.,"Germantown, MD",96,153,211,5.0,9/23/2017,"This restaurant has the biggest menu I've seen! It was so hard to decide what to get off the menu for dinner.  The tried the white peach margarita, it was very sweet but good! I got a second drink called Jerry Burst. It was a mixed beer of their red ale and their berry cider. It was lightly sweet and very easy to drink.  We made it for happy hour and tried one of their apps off the that menu. The spinach artichoke dip we ordered was so delicious. Very creamy and had a great consistency.  For dinner I chose the Southern Comfort sandwich. It was massive, I took a half of it home for lunch. The chicken was perfectly fried, with ham, cheese, and an awesome Alfredo sauce. It comes with fries that I also really liked.  For dessert we tried the s'mores pizookie. Trust me, you need a few people to finish this thing. It is HUGE. (See a theme here? You get a ton of food!) it has toasted marshmallows, peanut butter, and chocolate on the bottom with ice cream. It is one of the best desserts I've had recently!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-frederick
Kay S.,"Frederick, MD",4,39,52,4.0,11/4/2017,"UPDATE: (delayed) company sent me a gift card to visit again. Honestly, I wasn't going to. I can't take my family to a restaurant that doesn't have kid friendly silverware. But, kids wanted to try it again! SO GLAD WE DID! Had a much better experience. Pizza was crispy and toppings weren't greasy. I had Peruvian Shrimp Quinoa and it was SO FRESH AND FLAVORFUL! Hubs had tacos, which packed a good flavor punch! Didn't try the pizookie but we WILL go back. I still recommend all you parents out there have that plastic silverware on hand! Staff waa super as well!  My bison burger bun was soggy and disgusting. Our Pizookie came out WAY over cooked (solid chunk) and it was burned into the pan. We had to scrape off little bits just for our daughter to try. Very disappointing, fortunately it was free but still ruined our first BJs experience.  No kids silverware available?! My 5 year old got spaghetti everywhere, struggled to eAt and at one point poked her own mouth. We ended up just taking it with us for her to eat at home. I  will never return to a restaurant that doesn't have a smaller fork or spoon available, not family friendly!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-frederick
Jennifer G.,"Fort Lewis, Joint Base Lewis-McChord, WA",145,223,15,4.0,7/27/2017,First time at a BJ's restaurant. My friend and I ordered the lettuce wraps and a pizza. It was the thin crust one but not the flatbread in the appetizers. Everything was good. The waiter should of told us the yellow sauce with the lettuce wraps was spicy mustard. I would of been prepared better when I tasted it!  The pizza was good. Crust was super thin. I probably could of ate the whole thing. But we happened to come on a free dessert night so we didn't resist. I got the salted caramel and my friend got the double/triple...lots of chocolate one. The chocolate one was a but too chocolaty for me. Over all good experience and food was good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-frederick
Jayda N.,"Frederick, MD",12,1,1,3.0,11/15/2017,"Very nice and clean restaurant. The service was quick and good, my first time going and it was on a Wednesday. I got the Shrimp & Asparagus Penne.

Sam L.,"Gaithersburg, MD",128,458,718,3.0,7/15/2016,"An expansive American restaurant that also serves their own beer? It's not a new concept, but BJ's decor, menu and drink offerings are massive. Unfortunately their execution is average - meaning that there aren't that many ""wow"" moments. I tried their samplers (pick 4 beers in 5 oz) and found 3/4 to be eh (the winner was the nutty brewnette). Their crispy calamari portion size was also a bit small for the price and definitely taste like re-heated. It seems like an ideal place for work happy hour or a quick lunch spot. But I'd go elsewhere for dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-frederick
Marley D.,"Frederick, MD",110,136,135,4.0,5/10/2017,"Alright, I know I said I'd never come back here again after a string of less than displeasing service. However, Being that BJ's is one of the few restaurants open late at night I've been giving them another try. 1: service has improved significantly since the first few experiences I've had. The bartenders are ALWAYS great, sit at the bar for good service. In the last 15-20 times I've sat at the bar/high top tables, my order has been wrong only once, but it was taken care of promptly. Thank you.  2: the menu has had some changes over the past year and I will say I appreciate it. The food has improved and I must say I actually enjoy dining at BJ's now. 3: the restaurant is always kept clean, the bar area is very nice and despite being busy there is never an unusually long wait for food/drink orders. The bathrooms are also kept very clean so that definitely adds to this rating. Is it possible for a restaurant to change and get better even after a series of poor experiences? Obviously, yes.  Give BJ's a try if you're in the area, between the friendly bartenders, great IPA selection and good food; there's not much to complain about.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-frederick

I ordered the Crusted Chicken which was a little dry but otherwise delicious!

LA A.,"Silver Spring, MD",68,63,48,3.0,9/20/2017,Arrived at around 9:21pm with a party of ten people they seem a like shocked that we had so many people to accommodate. We got seat quickly and our server came to the instantly and introduced her as Cat at that moment I had a good feeling I could tell she was a veteran server right away she began to take out drink order in her tablet before exiting she mentioned that out drinks was being made already. She returned to our table with all of our ordered beverages and proceeded to take the appetizer order of calamari and a sampler platter at this point it went all down hill from the kitchen stand point. I'm not sure if the kitchen was busy or short handed because our appetizer too more than 25 to arrive to the table.. the calamari was good just need a pinch of salt as for the sampler platter all item le tasted good except the avocado egg roll they were  horrendous it literally was just mushy avocado deep fried in wonton wrap absolutely no seasoning it taste bland. As the server was picking up the dirty dishes we told her about dislike for the avocado roll she did mention you can exchange for more another sampler choice I highly recommend that you do. So after we were finished with the apps it took another 15 to 20 for entrees to arrive at the table and we had to return the vegetarian pizza cause it was ice cold so we waited again and the replacement pizza was piping hot. Buy the time it was almost 11pm and we wanted to leave. Our server Cat did her best with the circumstances as a veteran server do. This was my second experience at BJ's and encounter the same experience server was good but the food was mediocre not sure if I would ever dine there again in the near future.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-frederick

D H.,"Frederick, MD",0,18,57,2.0,7/15/2017,"Hit BJ's on a Friday evening after work with the family looking for relaxing time with food and beverages. We have been here several times before and this evenings visit was less stellar than in the past and wanted to pass along a review in case others have experienced similar. There were groups out front of the restaurant when we pulled up which should have tipped us to the dining experience to come. Shrugging that off we approached the hostess with several servers standing around and requested a table for 3. Received the standard verbiage of ~30 minutes before seated. Turns out as we waited this was the default answer for all that approached the hostess station seeking tables 30 mins wait and wait we did. Feeling for the family's with children in hand we continued waiting compounded by the fact that several tables were open empty and servers were standing around. Again this should have tipped us of the service/experience that we would eventually receive this evening. Getting hungrier and not relaxed as expected and after several couples finally got seated ahead of us we inquired about seating and asked about the empty tables. Vague response that we were next. After getting seated we learned from the server that the kitchen was the choke-point and caused a cascading effect, slow food, slow serving, slow to handle the volume of hungry customers waiting. At least the server was straight forward. Again we tried to return focus to relaxing and enjoying dinner but as it turns out more disappointment awaited. Our main order arrived at just around warm temperature. Sauce was left off appetizers and drink which run about $10 each was mixed incorrectly. So suffice to say this wasn't the best visit we have had here and based on this evening we would be reluctant considering all of the other choices in the are to visit again. To yelpers considering visiting, take note of the visual cue's, busy out front, empty tables, servers standing around, and apply to decision-making. Manager visited the hostess station once that we saw and should have noticed what was going on and the unhappy faces of customers waiting. Considered having a one on one with mgr but rather than prolong the situation we deferred. We'll consider options before visiting BJ's in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-frederick
Harris H.,"Germantown, MD",63,223,7,5.0,11/6/2017,"We have been wanting to try this place, so on our way  back from vacation we gave it a shot.  As we were sitting down, we looked around more and it really is very nice inside.  Our server was excellent and was on top of everything.  We were laughing at the menu.  It is literally a book and will take you some time to get through, much like a diner.  I settled on the jambalaya and it was very good. Plentiful amounts of sausage, chicken and shrimp.  My wife ordered their brisket burger and just couldn't say enough about how great it was.  It as cooked exactly how she wanted it.  It was a perfect ending to a great vacation.  We will definitely be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-frederick

Chris M.,"Alexandria, VA",1,65,56,4.0,4/14/2017,"The food was very good, prices were fair, and the beer was cold!  Our server was very pleasant and knowledgeable about the beer selection, making great recommendations.  The menu is like a phonebook, so read it cover to cover.  I almost went with the salmon tacos until I found the mahi mahi tacos a few pages back (much cheaper).  The kids' portions were substantial.  My only complaint was that the stuffed mushrooms could have been cooked a little more.  When the bill arrived, I was surprised to see our party of 2+4 kids come in under $50.  If traveling up 15/270, this is a great place to stop for a bite. Though there were no significant sporting events going on during our stay, you can clearly see the awesome 107"" flatscreen from about anywhere in the restaurant.  We were in the opposite corner and I could read everything on the screen for the CNN broadcast, so I'm sure this place is great for Ravens games.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-frederick
Doris B.,"Olney, MD",4,16,,4.0,9/15/2017,"I was there at 6:30 Thursday night with my husband, daughter, son-in-law, & grown granddaughter.  We were seated right away.  Husband, granddaughter, & I had pasta--better than some Italian restaurants.  The servings were generous enough that he & I took some home.  My shrimp & asparagus penne was loaded with asparagus & had a nice amount of well cooked shrimp.  Daughter & son-in-law had the 6"" pepperoni pizzas, which they loved.  We ordered the pizookie trio, which was huge, considering they were ""minis,"" and all three were delicious. The service, however, was the problem.  Our server was friendly and personable, but she was not attentive.  We had to stop another server to ask for drink refills; she brought my son-in-law water, but he had had Sprite.  We also stopped someone to ask for her so we could get a box for leftover pasta and order dessert.  I had also asked her to change the channel of the nearby television from the Orioles to the Nationals, but she didn't.  She did say, ""Didn't they change it?"" so perhaps she asked someone else to do it.  Then it was changed.  Still, we all felt ignored.  Perhaps she had too many tables or they were shorthanded.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-frederick

Donna H.,"Germantown, MD",250,29,11,4.0,2/23/2017,"I love this place. It is my go to American restaurant and I've been a customer since it opened.  Let me start with how beautiful the restaurant is, from the exterior to interior. The dark wood and trimmings on the walls are extravagant. At the bar, the bottle set up and the amount of taps are aesthetically pleasing.  The service here is sometimes a hit or a miss. When I sat at a high table near the bar, I received great service and was always checked on. However, at the other tables I noticed the service was pretty slow especially in getting the check and refilling drinks. Even when it's not busy, refilling drinks and checking up on us was an issue.  Here are the couple dishes I have tried:  --Hickory Brisket and Bacon Burger- amazing! This burger has so much flavor from the barbecue sauce but what really took the spotlight was the hickory pulled pork.  --New Orleans Jambalaya- The first time I had the Jambalaya was when they first opened and the dish tasted great, however recently the rice was too wet which really made the dish unappetizing.  --Spicy Peanut Chicken with Soba Noodles- okay dish, nothing special to order again.  --Roasted Salmon Peruvian Quinoa Bowl- the salmon was well seasoned and the veggies really complement the salmon. (Healthy option!!)  AND BEST OF ALL!! --PIZOOKIS- My all time favorite is the limited edition snickerdoodle. The cookie is warm and melts in your mouth. There is a crisp at the edges and the ice cream just tops it all off.

Marc S.,"Frederick, MD",17,15,,4.0,11/3/2017,"This place is very interesting. Most of my experiences have been very positive. Food is always good, service is usually great. Over the course of time I have had to endure my fair share of below average servers. These people tend to come and go so don't let a bad experience discourage you since they do tend to hire many excellent people too. I tend to go in here during the middle of the week every week for lunch and I can say that the two bartenders I see are always awesome (sadly I don't remember their names!). These two remember my order and give me great service every time I come in. They are always on top of my rewards and make sure my account gets updated with every visit. The food is amazing. The avocado egg rolls are unique and delicious, the pizza is usually awesome, their lunch menu is great, and the pizookie is amazing. They have some unique selections that separate them from the rest ie avocado egg rolls and pizookie. Even their salads are pretty filling if you would rather keep your meal light. Although you may run into a few bumps on the road, don't let that stop you from coming in here because the food is consistently great and 99 percent of the time the service is also just as great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-frederick?start=20

I got the chicken Alfredo pasta chicken looked like pre packaged grill mate chicken and there wasn't even a lot of it.. the pasta was very dry which led it to be lacking it flavor.. there was barely any sauce on the noodles.. they clearly do not know about noodle to sauce ratio...

Melanie K.,"Clarksburg, MD",33,225,158,3.0,3/1/2016,"We stopped in for an early dinner on Monday. It was one of the few (perhaps only) restaurant we've been to in recent memory where we didn't check any reviews prior to going in. The atmosphere is cool--very contemporary and sleek, with dark wood and marble table tops. There are tons of tables and a really large bar area. The beer menu is, in a word: extensive. The menu was pages (and I mean PAGES) long and at least 1/2 of it was filled with craft brews, in-house brews, and cocktails. It got to the point where I was thinking, ""They do serve food here, right...?? Oh, there it is."" We didn't drink. We were saving room for a nearby brewery tour/event we were attending. Next time! Onto the food. Hubby got a bacon turkey burger and seemed to like it. In the bite I took, I found the burger was moist and flavorful and the bun was tasty. I got a buffalo chicken grilled cheese with fries. The fries were crispy and yummy. The sandwich was OK. I mean, the flavors were decent (the bread was the star), but for some reason I was thinking it would be pulled buffalo chicken, but it was basically breaded boneless wings on toast. Heyyyoo carbs. Not the kind of meal you eat and then feel awesome after. I only ate half and still felt kind of blahhhh when I was done. I know this is nit-picky, but I also didn't like that my sandwich and hubby's burger were served on metal trays akin to a particular BBQ chain. BJ's felt a little classier than that, so the trays were out of place and kind of off-putting. Our waitress was extremely friendly, but a little too attentive. I liked that she gave us suggestions off the menu, but I didn't like how often she came over to our table. I think she stopped by the table 3 times during just our appetizer. An inattentive server would be worse, but there were times I felt a awkward by her presence. And then when we were paying, she stood near the table and before we were even done pulling money out asked if we were going to need change. I'm sure it was because it was early in her shift and she didn't have a lot of change, but c'mon. Be a little more tactful, girl! I'm sure SOMEONE could make you change if we would have needed it. Bottom line: I would come back. This seems like a good place to bring picky eaters or a large group because the menu is huge, so theoretically everyone should be able to find something they can eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-frederick?start=20

Flavors didn't mesh well, just tasted like a hamburger, fatty bacon, and mediocre brisket. The boyfriend ordered a ""deepdish chicken philly"" HA! It was chicken and veggies sitting on top of half cooked dough. And it was served on a plate. We literally thought they were bringing him the wrong dish when they dropped it off. I ate at a BJ's in Colorado Springs and was very happy with the food and atmosphere.... After eating here we just left feeling guilty for eating like crap and didn't even enjoy our cheat meal.

After that day have pretty much been there every Wed and Fri for the last month. Any pizookie is good but my family loves the cookies and cream and the monkey bread. The baked ziti (which I've had 5x) is life when made right. You can even dip the bread in the bowl and soak up the rest of the sauce. The pizza is ok, I like that the crust is thick and buttery. We didn't like the spaghetti and big meatballs, matter fact about to throw it away now. What is most impressive is the customer service. It actually places the icing on the cake.

We are not chain restaurant people, but if you're out by the mall and doing some shopping, it's a great option. We've been here several times now. We love their mozzarella salad with balsamic glaze. It's so good and so cheap. They won us over with it before we ever actually got our meals. I had a Mediterranean dish and it was filling and quite good. With chain places, you never know what you'll get but we were super impressed. And- we love their beer! They have a great selection and their waiters/waitresses that we've had have always been knowledgeable about what they carry. If you're out running around at this end of town, give them a try.

So I went in not totally sure what to expect. I always check the bathrooms even if I don't need to go. However in this instance I went twice- this one was clean and it was restocked and swept during my visit. That's something I appreciate in a restaurant. It was Sunday afternoon and it was busy but not packed. I can't remember our server's name but he was great. He was attentive without visiting our table too often. And he gave great recommendations. Drinks - Made in house Root Beer and Cream Soda. And my favorite - Strawberry Lemonade! So delicious. (and unlimited refills!) Food - We started with the Root Beer Rib - yummy.And then we each had a salad. I loved that I was able to make a few changes and additions without it being a big deal. Mom had the fish tacos - she loved them. Husband had the Brisket, bacon, burger and wedge fries - More love. And I had the deep dish 5 meat pizza. I just (30 min ago) had the 2nd half for lunch - it warmed up beautifully on my pizza stone and that makes it worthy of 5 stars alone! Pizza does not always reheat well. Why did I have half my pizza left over? Well that's easy, I wanted to save room for the Pizookie mini's! We had the Cookies n Cream, Triple Chocolate and the  new Monkey Bread Pizookie Mini's as a trio. I would happily have had the dessert first! They were SO good.

The avocado rolls were creamy and unlike anything we've tried before. For entrées she ordered the Mediterranean pizza. A mix of pesto, tomatoes and olives with feta and onions. Great filler. I had the chicken bacon Mac and cheese which was very filling. The awesome: the beer here is fantastic. The lager is award winning. The Kolsch and the Irish ale is spot on. Not a fan of the Heffeweissin(too sweet- like banana bread) but the winner of the beer flight was the oasis red ale- just enough punch with no bitterness.  The bad: Frederick law prevents the beer leaving the building in a growler.  There are kid items, and they can accommodate large parties of up to twenty or do with advance notice.

We sat at the bar (already had dinner) and order two beers, one locally brewed BJ's (I wanna say it's the summer berry brewed cider, which was so good, but that totally screams girly-spritzer-girl-who-doesn't-drink-beer)... but that local brew and one not (a Blue Moon).   Cookies and cream Pizooki's - It was everything everyone said it is: AMAZING.  A cold scoop of vanilla ice cream and a dollop of oreo whipped cream (never seen that) over a gooey hot brownie!  And as if we couldn't get more glutinous, our fabulous bartending waitress  mentioned how good the S'Mores pizooki was.  So it's safe to say we'll be back to try that AND the food next time.  Mission accomplished.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-frederick?start=40

Kendrick P.,"Columbia, MD",70,13,22,1.0,4/1/2016,"Okay let me give you the settings. 6 adults 2 kids. Thursday night (Ravens vs.Steelers tnf). One 29 year old looking to have a nice family birthday outing. We arrive at 7:45, we're seated, don't get noticed until 8. After that we order our drinks. Another 10 minutes pass. I look around and see a decently crowded restaurant nothing overflowing and no line at the door. 8:15 and we're looking for a waiter to take our order and bring us drinks. Eventually the first guy comes back and takes our order and brings half of our drinks. Appetizers come out at 8:45. One ""adult"" in our party ordered a milk, still no milk. 9 o' clock approaches half of the meals come out. 9:15 comes and everyone has their meal now, except for Tim. Tim is now missing his milk, and his meal. The Ravens vs Steelers game is on and the Ravens are up 7-3. Time passes and we're watching the game and chatting on about Joey's birthday and what not. 9:30 Tim has no meal and the waiter hasn't revisited the table yet. The group starts to feel bad as some of us are half way through our meals or further. We flag down another waitress and ask her about his burger. (She actually becomes our waiter for a little bit.) She goes to kitchen and comes back stating ""the burger is on the grill it'll be out soon"". 9:45 Tim has no burger, and no milk. 10:00pm Tim has given up, doesn't want the burger, doesn't want his milk wants to pick up Mickey D's on the way home and sob. Some how we get a new waiter, from the other two, coming by and asking how we are doing. Again we restate Tim's burger hasn't come out. He claims ""the burger is on the grill it'll be out soon"". 10:20 The manager comes by and we mention the predicament. They immediately bring out a burger. Unfortunately, it's not the burger that he ordered, but Tim is starving at this point and would settle for garbage scraps. He eats the burger completely, restating that this is not what he ordered and that the burger is poorly made. The manager comes by, we express our concerns. At this point Tim is livid with the service he's received and claims he is never coming back to this BJ's. The manager takes over the table gives us our checks that we've been waiting on. Gives Tim a free meal and a $50 gift card. Tim attempts to decline the gift card because ""I never want to come to BJ's again"". The manager does a decent job handling the circumstance calming Tim down, not allowing any of the other waiters to interfere. Eventually Tim accepts the gift card, but gives it to the birthday boy because he refuses to step foot in this facility for the rest of his life.  Alright, let's take a step back from the overall experience and focus on Kendrick. I ordered a specialty pizza and wings. Pizza was very mediocre, wings were alright but not worth the price. I would say the service was shit. Food is overpriced. But really I just felt bad for Tim.

When our waiter came back, his comment was: ""Thanks for being so patient."" Not sure if that was suppose to be funny, but seemed a little snarky for a waiter. I'm sure the place is a nice place, but we didn't have a good experience. We ordered Asian Chopped salads and when the food came, they gave us a Dijon-like dressing when we should have gotten a honey-ginger dressing. My friend also noticed that some of the ingredients in the Asian salad was suppose to have grilled chicken breast, romaine, bibb lettuce, Napa cabbage, red bell peppers, snow peas, green onions, shredded carrots, sesame seeds, crisp wonton strips, cilantro and mandarin oranges. We only had chicken, lettuce, wonton strips, and mandarin oranges.  My friend's daughter ordered off the kids menu (garlic chicken pasta with broccoli). My friend wasn't expecting long noodles (for a kid to eat) and mentioned when she ordered it last time they came out with small, short spiral noodles.

We go online and order a chicken tortilla soup and blackened Cajun pasta. At 6:55 it says your order will be ready at 7:45. Wow. Okay. So we go up there early thinking it might come sooner than an hour. We get there and sit at the bar and have a drink. We tell the hostest who we are and where we'll be. She comes up a couples of minutes later saying that the online order system doesn't show up until it's closer to when our food should arrive. So we tell her our order. We wait a full hour. She never stops by and is nowhere to be found. When it comes out I only see the soup and ask where is everything else and she says it's already inside the soup. So all of the avocado and tortilla strips and cheese are sitting in hot soup. Brilliant. I tell her that it's not right and should be on the side. She goes back and the bartender agrees that it was just put together wrong. No exaggeration a full ten more minutes later she saunters out with an ""I don't give an eff"" attitude. We take it and leave. Get back to the hotel and my husband's meal is completely wrong. They didn't even put the chicken on the pasta. The soup tastes like she just used the soggy tortilla soup and put more stuff on the side. Come on people! It's pasta and a pre-made soup!!!  I have never in my life written a bad review about anything but this visit sent me over the edge. What a waste of money.

The cheese they sprinkled on top didn't even melt....  the marinara sauce was cold. Seriously? If you're going to use frozen mozzarella sticks, at least do it right. Then, my main dish was the chicken with rice, black beans, feta cheese, and sauce.  Again, chicken was warm but the rice and beans were cold.  The cheese didn't even melt.   It was the worst restaurant meal I've had in a long time.  I don't know if management changed, but I definitely won't be back unless something is fixed in their kitchen.

The other steak was served missing it's shrimp which took another 10 minutes to come out. They finally brought-out a new steak and asparagus of which was acceptable, but the steak was still over cooked. One of the entrees came with a free desert, but it ended-up a separate charge on the bill. The waitress eventually took it off but was very put-out by the fact we asked for the correction.

Leilani R.,"Ballenger Creek, MD",11,65,127,4.0,1/12/2014,"I enjoyed my first visit. It was a Friday evening and we were on the call ahead wait list. Despite that, it took 45 minutes to get a table. I can't imagine the wait if you just walked in. It's a new place so I would expect long waiting on weekend evenings anyway.  I enjoyed the Jeremiah Red, the Oasis amber and Nutty brunette beer. I will definitely go back and try the others. I'm not so hung up on them not brewing ON site like others have expressed in their review as it is their beer being shipped in anyway. I don't have a need to see the brewing process. I've frequented Barley and Hops for years (as well as other brewery type restaurants) and I work in Biotech Biopharm. I'm over seeing all the shiny tanks. Besides, Brewers Alley moved their brewery outside their restaurant and that helped expand the bar area tremendously.  That place is STILL hopping without the tanks and I'm sure that's helped in bringing in more customers.  The food was good. I had the hand tossed spicy meatball pizza. It was tasty and probably could have stayed in the oven a little longer. I like crispy bottoms. I tasted the deep dish. It was good too. Very airy and not so dense. The mini size was tiny but probably a good option if you loaded up on beer and appetizers beforehand. Could have used more cheese/toppings.  Overall I would visit them again. Every new restaurant needs to shake out the kinks until they can get into a more consistent/efficient mode. Beer is good IMHO. Besides, taste IS subjective so don't base whether to try this place or not from someone else's opinion. Try it the craft beer out and judge the taste yourself. Ambiance is nice. Waitstaff was pleasant enough.  Oh, the bathrooms were stylish and pretty clean. Always a plus in MY book if you want a good review. ;) Welcome to Frederick, BJs!  We need more places like yours in this town and more night life places that stay open longer!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-frederick?start=60

Steve L.,"Brookeville, MD",4,35,,1.0,11/21/2015,"Been here twice in 30 days.  Normally, I'd learn from the first time, but each time it was the place my young nephews choose to go for their birthday dinners.  (The older nephew attends a college in the area and he does not have enough life experience to know about good and lesser restaurants and the younger nephew choose BJ's because that is where his older brother choose to go.) Pluses - this is probably a great place to have a couple of beers, some mediocre bar food, and watch several games at once.  The bar area is large and the beer selection is impressive.  That is where it stops. I want to note that I essentially had the same experience for both visits.  A group of 7-8 of us each time, with a reservation, and in fact slightly early, and the restaurant was not full.  The hostess essentially ignored us until our reservation was called.  Once the reservation was called, a table had to be found for us that accommodated 7-8 people.  I certainly had the sense that there was not much of a plan to seat us, and ""they'd get to it when they get to it"". The main issue is the service at the table, or lack thereof.  I observed that the server had no more than 3 parties each time and was not spending a lot of time with the other 2 parties.  Just bringing water to the table was time consuming.  Then she left for awhile and came back to take drink orders, which took an unusually long time for delivery.  (How can ice tea, soft drinks, and maybe one bottle of beer take 10 minutes?)  Then she left again prior to asking if we had any questions about menu.  She eventually came back and took the orders.  An extraordinarily long time passed again before appetizers were delivered.  So and so forth throughout the meal.  While both servers were very pleasant, I just can't figure out the time factor issue.  Bottom line, a fairly simple meal took almost two hours. The food itself was OK to good, but not something that I'd return for, given the service.  For the second visit, my nephew ordered a 1/2 rack of ribs.  A full rack was delivered (which he would have eaten without a problem).  The server realized the mistake, told him that she'd ""be in big trouble"", if she didn't take the plate back and bring a plate with a 1/2 rack of ribs.  What did she (or the kitchen do)?  The rack was clearly cut in half and who knows where the other half went?  (The clean white rib was showing where it was cut vs. a properly prepared 1/2 rack.)

Elisabeth H.,"Frederick, MD",45,148,9,2.0,2/12/2014,"Ate at BJ's for the first time last weekend and was very underwhelmed. The restaurant looks great, the service was good for the most part, the food was not bad but nothing to write home about. We popped in on Sunday night for a light meal and were impressed with the space. The restaurant was much bigger then I had expected it to be from the outside. We were seated quickly and our waitress came over right away. We both tried some of BJ's drink options a beer and cider. I eat GF so can only comment on what I could have which was the cider, and it was bad. I have tried several different kinds of cider and I found this disgustingly sweet. It almost tasted like a strawberry wine but even sweeter. Not what I was looking for but if you like really sweet drinks I would recommend you this.  The menu is massive, almost reminds me (size wise) of the Cheesecake factory and was a little intimidating. We opted for the cobb salad and a GF pizza. It was all very underwhelming but the salad more so. I have a 'thing' read big pet peeve with shredded taco iceberg taco lettuce being passed off as a salad. It seems cheap to me and like corners are being cut especially when you are paying around $13 plus for  a salad. The quantity of toppings was disappointing also very sparse. Just very blah.  The GF pizza was good, not bad but not great. I have had better and personally think Domino's is better.  The service was good with a couple exceptions. On the website they advertise a gluten free menu we asked for one but were told they ran out? Which is strange I feel like people don't get to keep or take home their menu. In the absence of the menu the waitress was as helpful as she could be but didn't want to assume so I was left with few options. At $45 for two people to have one drink share a salad and pizza the price is a little high. Had the food been better I wouldn't have minded as much, but it wasn't.

Steve B.,"New Market, MD",0,69,,4.0,7/6/2015,"We've enjoyed dinner at BJ's twice in the last couple months (I had to rewrite that sentence twice, because inside I'm a 12-year-old boy). First, my wife and I took our little grandchild, and on a Saturday late afternoon, it was a long wait in the crowded little lobby. Once we got in, though, it worked well for us. Extensive menu, and all we've tried has been good. Long list of beers (including their own and other micros) and fun drinks. TV's all over, and lots to look at. Service was pretty good. Our second date there, just the two of us, kept pace with the first. We enjoyed the appetizer combo (which I knew would be too much food, and it was), the seared Ahi salad, and the parmesan crusted chicken. All were good, and my chicken was excellent. I tried a few of their beers, which were tasty. Pros: long and varied menu. Cheerful service, and pretty quick to tableside. Lots of drink choices. Lots to look at. Servings are pretty big, but there are lots of smart choices on the menu. Cons: The wait for a table (we did not call ahead, which might have helped). Loud, ""warehouse-y"" atmosphere. We'll be back to try more things on that menu, and I have high hopes. We'll also plan to beat the dinner rush if we can.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-frederick?start=100

My kid was completely happy with his food. They have tons of side choices for little ones instead of the same old boring fries or veg of the day.  Side note on cool for kids factor: the crayons are triangular  so they don't roll off the table and the kids drinks have bendy straws so the aren't tipping and spilling everytime they take a drink.  Only parents of toddlers can appreciate not having crayons roll on the floor every 4 minutes.  Overall,  an enjoyable experience. 4.5 stars overall.

All of that said - the manager came by the table and apologized for all the mistakes, slowness, etc. She didn't make excuses and simply owned the problems. That was refreshing and we were willing to leave it at that. She then said our lunch was on her and asked if we wanted anything else to eat/drink.  We thanked her for the free lunch and declined any more food, etc.  The fact that we received a sincere apology would likely have been enough to make us give it one more try.

Derek H.,"New Market, MD",11,34,67,2.0,12/21/2013,"This restaurant is new to the area. They opened across the street from Barley and Hops, a local restaurant and brewery.  It's also across the street from an Applebee's.  Given the title, I was expecting something more...like a better restaurant and brewery.  They had a wide variety of beer but it was clear they didn't brew it there. (not that there is anything wrong with that)  But honestly, with brewery in the title, I wanted a nice beer paired with my lunch.  The beer is priced double that of Barley and Hops and comparatively half as flavorful. The food is certainly tastier than an Applebee's.   The interior and exterior design of the restaurant is great.  In the end, you don't go to a restaurant to look around. You go there to eat and take in the entire experience.  Our server was really slow but pleasant. The place has only been opened for a month so maybe she's really new.  For an appetizer, I had a chicken tortilla soup. Very cool serving presentation and full of flavor. Seriously, that was a really tasty soup!  For the entree, I had the barbecue bison burger.  The plating was nice but it really lacked flavor. It didn't have chipotle BBQ sauce, pico de gallo, or baja sauce (as listed on the menu).  I actually looked up the burger, once I got home. I bet it would have been a halfway decent tasting burger, if they would have remembered to include everything listed in the menu description. The one thing worth going for was the dessert, a ""Pizookie"" trio. It's three mini fresh baked cookies (white chocolate and macadamia nut, chocolate chip and a chocolate on chocolate), with ice cream, served in mini pizza style pans.  Proceeds from Pizookie sales go to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. A little charity is always nice. If you want to have a tasty beer (made on site) with your lunch or dinner, go across the street to Barley and Hops. If you're thinking of maybe going to Applebee's, try this place. I'm sure this location will get better in time. For that reason, we'll give it another shot.  Until then, I'm looking forward to a few outings to Barley and Hops. ps. If you have kids, bring some paper for drawing. They hand out crayons and a paper menu but it's really not that fun for a kid.  A few math problems?  Really?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-frederick?start=120

Daniel M.,"Frederick, MD",0,19,,2.0,2/1/2015,"I place BJ's in a category of restaurants that seem to be focused on image and setting as much as they are about food. I suppose a lot of restaurants strives to have an identity beyond just food in some way, but sometimes it seems that the food takes second seat to the overall feel.  I was curious to try BJ's when they opened, they seemed to be going for that more 'upscale chain' type restaurant (think Gordon Biersch or Cheesecake Factory).  When we walked in, we were met by what seemed to be a team of staff whose first question was whether or not we had a reservation.  I do understand that there are certainly some places where a reservation was essential, but I had a hard time believing that only a week after opening, this massively expansive restaurant had become such the hot spot that a reservation was required for 11 am lunch on a weekday. We were seated in a very comfortable booth, and while we waited (and waited) for someone to take our drink order, I had ample time to survey the decor.  Overall, it felt forced and jumbled. Incorporating elements of various high end establishments I had visited over the years. My overall impression was that they really had no individual identity, they were only mimicking elements of other establishments. Looking over the menu, it was clear this approach carried over to the food offerings.  Most items on the menu seems vaguely reminiscent of other restaurants.  We selected Avocado egg rolls as an appetizer, as I really enjoy the ones from Cheesecake factory, and these seemed to be virtually identical based on the description. The only difference ended up being the flavor, which was sadly absent. Bland and undercooked. We ordered a variety of burgers and sandwiches among us, and the common opinion was that we had all tried something similar someplace else, and it was better at the other place. The burger patties were frozen, and seasoning was not to be found. The fries not he side were no more than food service grade frozen from a bag.  While I don't feel that any of the food was such that it was inedible, it seemed to have little effort put into it. If you are looking for a comfortable place to meet with friends, have some drinks and a bite to eat. This wouldn't be a bad place (although it gets a bit noisy when it starts filling up), but if you are looking for a memorable meal, this really isn't the place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-frederick?start=120
Lloyd W.,"Williamsburg, VA",3,148,14,2.0,1/1/2015,"After having lunch at BJ's with two business associates, my attitude is as indifferent as the service we experienced. The noontime hostess took our name and brushed us off to the side with all the warmth of the cold post Christmas week weather. Once seated (a very short wait) our waiter (Mark T.) approached before we had settled in and asked for our drink and appetizer order. When we passed on an app, he asked for our lunch order...Again, we had not been in the booth for more than 45 seconds! I understand all about turning tables but give me a break. So we ordered and the food was delivered in short order and the server conducted the ""auction:"" ""Who had the Cobb Salad? Scallops? So you must have the Fish Tacos then?"" Then she left never to be seen again which was fine except we had no silverware. We flagged down our waiter who was gone for at least 3 minutes before we asked another staff member who was kind enough to deliver the utensils and napkins. Mark T. never returned to ask about our food. The food was OK (a 3-Star on the Yelp scale) as were the portion sizes while the soup was warm at best. The total experience was a ""2"" due to indifferent staff starting with the hostess and ending with our waiter's ""hit and run"" drop of the check without even the obligatory ""have a nice day."" Of course the check provided the so very handy calculation of a 15%,18% and 20% tip.

Adele A.,"Frederick, MD",0,9,,3.0,1/17/2014,"I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars. I went to BJs for lunch with a coworker last week. CONS:it took (no exaggeration) 20 minutes for a server to come over to our table. And after he took our drink order he said we weren't his table and our server would be over shortly. Ten minutes later he came back with our drinks (we never saw the person who was supposed to be our server). The tables are awkwardly close together and we were seated right next to a four top. The menu is pretty expensive. I ordered a salad that was $15. Granted it had salmon on it and it was delicious, but I'm not sure how often I'd like to spend $15 on lunch.  PROS: immediately upon walking in, you are in awe of the building. High ceilings, a beautiful bar, lots of space and TVs. The food is very good and the selections are bountiful. They make their own soda which seems to be a big hit there (I didn't try it).  BJ's is a chain. They market themselves as a Cheesecake Factory type restaurant but specializing in deep dish pizza and beer instead of cheesecake. Their beer prices aren't that great (happy hour drafts are $4...

Steve P.,"Williamsport, MD",0,3,,1.0,4/26/2015,The food came out very slow. The tea was like water. The waiter was nice but couldn't keep up with the volume of the restaurant. He seemed like a veteran but still wasn't able to keep the kitchen pumping out his orders. Maybe not his fault but guess what..... not mine either.   There were 7 of us and they weren't able to accommodate is all at a table. I sat in a chair at the end of a 6 person booth. This was uncomfortable.  I asked for a burger medium rare and it was well done. There was sausage in the lasagna we ordered when we clearly asked for a vegetarian meal. He apologized for like the fourth time. Lots of apologies from the waiter. All four burgers were cold. The shrimp scampi pasta had almost no sauce or flavor.  There were TVs showing sports but the one by my table had the news on. I couldn't tell what was being said so I didn't watch. There was lots of noise. These arson the booth were cracked and torn.

Laura R.,"Frederick, MD",0,3,,4.0,4/11/2014,"We went on a weeknight and called ahead so we didn't have to wait at the restaurant. The atmosphere was nice--I didn't feel like I was in a cheesy chain restaurant. Our waiter was friendly and on the ball. We ordered the corn fritters and santa fe spring rolls. Both were great but the corn fritters were AWESOME! Highly recommend those. My husband ordered the jalapeño burger and didn't like the way it was cooked (the outer rim was VERY charred), but the flavor was good--not as spicy as you'd think, but still good. I had the double deluxe burger and it was delicious! We split a chocolate chunk pizookie and I had a surprisingly fantastic cup of coffee. I would go back just for coffee and dessert!

However the waiter dropped a full glass of iced tea behind me & my coworker which splashed our coats  & partially our clothes. They came by to clean up floor fairly quickly - we were given a few extra napkins by the waiter who said he was sorry.  I get that he may have been embarrassed, but it was really treated as a nonevent.  And we did not make any kind of scene.  We're quite sure the staff did not tell the manager. Unfortunately this, along with a few other minor mix ups with our orders, didn't leave an overall great impression. Food was good and fair value for the prices.  Nice decor and not too loud. All in all, consensus was would go back and maybe try their brews after work.

It should be just another 2 or 3 minutes."" .....oooookay it had already been more than 40.... It was another 15 minutes before we were finally shown to our table. Things didn't get better though..... We sat for about 10-15 minutes with server after server walking past our table and no one came to greet us. We finally tried waving a server over and she looked right at us and kept walking.... Nice. We were finally able to get the attention of another server and we placed our order.

Mark A.,"Frederick, MD",0,6,,2.0,3/15/2014,"Had dinner with my family tonite, party of 4.  Called ahead and was told there was a 30 minute wait (didn't understand this but okay).  Arrived at our reservation time and was seated within 5 minutes - felt bad for all the people that were there before us.  Stacy, our server, was very nice and informative. That's where it ended. Took nearly 2 hours to complete the meal!  Our two beers came our rather quick but nearly 15 minutes for the kids sodas to arrive.  Stacy lost the first tray when another coworker bumped into her but I would have thought that someone would have expedited the re-order. Corn fritters came out after 10 minutes but realizing the other tables were not getting their stuff, I ordered calamari - took nearly 25 minutes to arrive. After 90 minutes, I grabbed the manager to let him know we had been waiting and he said he would check on it. The burgers and tacos arrived soon after. Never heard from him again but saw him walking thru the restaurant picking up menus and running back to the hostess station.  The charm we had seen initially from Stacy had all but evaporated., We asked for the check and Stacy said the manager had adjusted the bill because of the wait, I had to look at the bill to see what was up, seeing he had taken off the calamari as a nice gesture.  As we walked out I stopped the manager to thank him but also the say he should have followed up with us at the table.  His comment was ""I got real busy"". Really? I worked in the business for many years. I have not had service like this in a long time.  It was just beer and burgers.

We ordered drinks, apps and our sons dinner when she finally arrived. Our drinks came, then half of our apps. We placed our orders and again waited. About 30-35 mins later our food arrives. We had to ask where the other half of the apps were that we never recieved and OUR SONS which we had ordered 40 mins or more prior to this. Took our first bite and ALL of our food was cold! Asked for the manager. She took the food back, both her and the server blamed the kitchen and said they would bring us fresh. About 10 mins later our food comes back out along with our sons, finally. Our sons food was not even what he had asked for. We had to ask our server for refills on water (only time we saw her). The couple we were with were finished their dinner by the time we finally got ours so they ordered dessert. Our son asked the server for a few strawberries and she said of course she would be back. About 15 mins go by and still no dessert and no strawberries, however the waitress dropped off our bills! Finally, after asking for the dessert and strawberries again the dessert came out. It wasn't until we left that we got the strawberries from the hostess at the front desk!!!!! This is the worst service and excuses we have ever heard!

You can tell a lot about a place from the dressings they serve.  Ranch came with the dinner salad and was also placed as a side to the kids meals.  Right out of a plastic container with out even a hint of a quality name brand.  $10.95 for spring rolls that came out a bag from the schwans guy. The fish and chips was ok but lacking in flavor even though the batter was made with one of their hand crafted beers.  I hope the beer on its own has more flavor or what's the point.  Wife said her salmon was pretty good but nothing special.  Could have gotten it at an Applebee's.  Service was ok as well which is to say that we were served. When the waitress asked if we had been in before we answered ""no"". Great opportunity for here to upsell us on the menu or dessert which we didn't end up ordering.  No. She took the time to tell my two kids that they had ten hand crafted beers which we didn't order either.  Know your audience and in the mean the, remove some of the used dishes from the table once in a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-frederick?start=200

Jerry W.,"Frederick, MD",0,22,,4.0,1/19/2015,"With its beautiful Art Deco mural, granite tabletops, dark wood accents, and stunning bar, BJ's is truly a gorgeous restaurant - hands down the fanciest sports bar I have ever eaten in.  That being said, the menu doesn't reflect the decor, that isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I think its important to note.  The menu serves casual dining staples like grilled salmon and rice pilaf, rib eye with mash potatoes and green beans, pizzas, burgers, and a handful of pasta dishes (you get the idea).  During my visit to BJ's, I had their burger with cheddar and bacon and a side of french fries ($8.95).  My wife had their raspberry tea mocktail and shrimp tacos (two), which were stuffed with shrimp (at least 8 shrimp per taco) and came with a side of tortilla chips and two kinds of sauces.  We also shared their corn fritters with chipotle/bacon aioli (best bite of the night).  My burger was flavorful and my wife enjoyed her drink and tacos.  Our meal came to 27 dollars.

Angela S.,"New Market, MD",0,1,,4.0,1/8/2014,"Haven't been in person but have had carry out.

He called and offered to bring me carry out. He read most of the menu to me (great selection and range of foods offered) I decided on the fried chicken. You get two chicken breasts, cheddar mashed potatoes, vegetable and a white gravy. My husband asked for the gravy on the side. Who wants soggy fried chicken?  The meal arrived quickly but the gravy was on the chicken. The bartender took it back and placed a second order. This time it took awhile. The bartender apologized profusely for the delay and had the manager comp the meal. The cheddar mashed potatoes were great. The vegetable (corn) and gravy were okay. The chicken was very good. I reheated the chicken in our toaster oven for a few minutes. It was crunchy on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside. I think the use of a few seasonings in the coating would be nice.

Ashley P.,"Washington, DC",100,293,56,5.0,9/13/2014,"I had a great experience here! I always try to visit a BJ's when I can, since they support Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. So, it was a nice treat when I spotted a recently opened location in Frederick, while in town on business. I walked right into a clean, airy, modern restaurant, and was warmly greeted. There were a good number of people there at 6:00ish on a Wednesday night when I went, but I didn't have to wait for a table. My server was friendly and attentive. I went with the pepperoni pizza, which is always a hit. I noticed it wasn't deep dish, so it would've been helpful if the server had asked, since I incorrectly assumed it would automatically be a deep dish pizza. Womp womp womp. Still, it was delicious, and a pepperoni lover's dream! For dessert I went with their s'mores pazookie (butchering the spelling here), and it was literally one of the best desserts I've ever had in the almost (I said almost) three decades I've been living!

Francis S.,"Frederick, MD",6,65,13,1.0,8/9/2014,"So as you know I will just put it out there as I see it. This place opened and I waited until they had a month to get it right. Well I have been once a week since and I can say it's not because the food is overwhelming, or the atmosphere although they are ok. What keeps us going back are a few good dishes, some decent adult beverages, the sports them, but the biggest reason is the Server we found is a diamond in this coal mine of a restaurant. Yes the server and a couple of dishes will keep me as a regular. However this place lacks a lot of things.  1) For starters the management staff - is un-attentive and avoids conflict at all cost. Many times we have had an issue with a dish or something from the kitchen. And most of the time the manager never stopped by the table. The GM is what I like to call ""Decorative"" meaning they are there from 9am to 5pm and out the door just to do the bare minimum. The rest of the managers including the GM do no table touches to check on the guests. Also I have to say ""From my own experience"" the GM is not to be trusted. She has told many untruths and I have lost all respect and confidence in this so-called management staff.  2) The kitchen - this can be a hit or miss process. The chicken dishes are your safe bet and a few apps are ok. Forget the salads and some times the fish is over cooked. They do burn things as roasted veg should never be black and look like lumps of coal. Pizza is a bust. Get to a local pizza shop if you want pizza but not here.  3) The Servers - I can count on one hand (right or left you choose) the number of good servers and on 1/2 of a hand the number of excellent servers. But it takes all my fingers and toes and yours to start with how many poor or just out and out bad servers there are. Again management allows them to run amuck and holds none of them accountable. When the poor servers start complaining that the good and excellent servers have a loyal following and only want to sit in their sections as unfair you know it's not good. So when management fails to manage and weed out the poor performing staff but instead causes issues for the other servers there is a problem. I have a favorite server and we have become friends as a family with this person. I request to sit in their section and will wait to get a table there. But because the whining others the GM will force us and others to sit where the service is going to be crap. And to top it off will lie to your face as to why you can't sit with the server you want. You know I ran many restaurants and I never refused a guests request to sit in a requested servers section. I made every effort to make it happen unless the server was off or getting off of a shift. But never did I lie as this GM and management staff have done.  4) The Bar - You gotta catch the right bartender or your basic mixed drink or house special will be screwed up. The beer selection is good for a on-site brew and the homemade sodas are good as well and refills on the sodas are an excellent value. But again hit or miss at times with the bar.  Over all this rating I gave BJ's is largely due to management and some food issues. I know if new management came in and cleaned out the poor performers this could be a rock solid eatery.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-frederick?start=140

Bryan Y.,"Sykesville, MD",0,9,,5.0,1/31/2016,"Fabulous!   Yes it took one hour to get seated in a crowded waiting area but it was Saturday night so expected.   The bar was open so technically you could easily start drinking while you wait  ...    The food was on-point.   Hot, well cooked, and a ton of menu & alcohol choices.   Nice portion size for sharing.   The waitress was awesome!    The reviews on here have some truth but ALL of the food complaints could have been easily straightened out by telling the server or manager, no big deal.    Give this place a try.  Its a great casual, warehouse-y experience after shopping or just a spot where you can relax in jeans and down beers.   Better than the Applebee, Greene Turtles, Ruby Tuesday, etc .... chains, in my opinion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-frederick?start=140
Robert L.,"Walkersville, MD",0,4,5,2.0,7/26/2014,"It was our second time at BJ half an hour ago. The service was super slow with a total of three different people waiting on us. My husband ordered a burger and it was cold, dry, and not even half a pound! I ordered Hawaiian mahi mahi, supposedly with spicy soy ginger sauce, and the flavor was bland. There was no ginger at all! We also ordered the tomato mozzarella and the tomatoes where anemic. BJ's food are not worth the price they are charging.  On our first visit, the bison burger was as dry as leather.

Jim R.,"Frederick, MD",1,24,44,3.0,12/9/2015,"Great burgers! Very possibly the best hamburger choices in the entire region! They've got one of the largest menus I've ever seen. The thing could become a lethal weapon in the event of a barroom brawl! The food is definitely above average. Lots and lots of choices. If you're dieting, you may want to avoid this establishment. As for the atmosphere ... Well, it's more akin to a military mess hall than a fine dining restaurant. A lot of noisy people noisily eating and sloshing suds. Nice bar appropriately separated from most of the eatery seating. And, of course, it's equipped with the obligatory sports television sets. I'm not particularly crazy about the steaks. Tried the ribeye. A bit tough. Same for the strip steak. Hey, this ain't Ruth's Chris, for cryin' out loud. Ruth's specializes in USDA prime. You'll get USDA choice here. A lesser cut, to be sure.

Laura F.,"Charles Town, WV",0,1,,1.0,1/27/2015,"This restaurant was a huge disappointment. It was beautiful inside as far as looks go, but that's about as good as it got. Our waitress took forever to get to the table. 7 Mins is way too long, keep in mind we have a small child with us, too,  to even be acknowledged when there are 4 tables in the whole place, most of which were eating. When she finally got to the table, she had a nasty attitude. We felt very rushed. We ordered our drinks, after another 10 mins, they arrived.  We finally made our food selections, bad idea. I ordered the Mediterranean Chicken Tacos, my husband ordered a simple bacon cheeseburger with the thick fries, and my son ordered the corn dogs with carrots. When our food came, the pasta medley that comes with the tacos tasted like some sort of medicine. It has a chemical taste to it. The tacos were bland and had zero flavor. I noticed my husband had stopped eating halfway through his burger and asked him what was wrong, he said it tasted funny. The bacon looked like a dog treat and the burger looked like meatloaf. The sandwich had sat too long under the food warmer and was hard as a rock. Our waitress came back long enough for me to order rice instead of the nasty pasta that came with it. She huffed off with the pasta and said that it would be a few minutes for the rice.... it was 15 and i was already finished my meal by that point. We asked for a manager and he honestly seemed like he couldn't have cared less about our table or the issues we were having. After a long drawn out conversation, he took my husbands food off of our check and had our waitress drop it off. Magically, her attitude perked up when check time came. She still didn't get that great of a tip.Probably one of the WORST places i have ever been in my life.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-frederick?start=140

Chelsea R.,"Frederick, MD",45,49,14,2.0,8/14/2014,"Every time I have been here, the service has been sub-par, but I waited to give them a chance to settle in before I gave a bad review. Last night was my fourth visit to BJ's, and likely my last.  I came for dinner and had about a 5 minute wait at 7 pm. Not bad for the dinner rush, I have to say. Then we were seated and the waiter, who must have been new, came over to greet us. We ordered our drinks, and the beer took over 15 minutes to arrive at the table. We ordered our food:calamari as an app, a small pizza for me, and jambalaya for the person with me. 20 minutes later, the pizza shows up. (We have no utensils at this point either. Every time I have been here I have had to ask for silverware.) We asked about the calamari,  and he tells us he ""must not have caught that"". 10 minutes later, I am eating very awkwardly so that my pizza doesn't get cold...and he brings the calamari (which was VERY greasy and cold). We had to ask about the jambalaya, which he had to search for, and had apparently forgotten to put in as well because he didn't have any idea where it could be. We finally got the jambalaya after I was completely finished eating. It was a lousy experience to say the least.  Even though I love the food, I don't want to beg them to bring it to my table. BJ's is not the place for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-frederick?start=140

Maz W.,"Clarksburg, MD",1,49,39,1.0,8/13/2016,"I agree with the reviewers who said this place has gone downhill. Case in point is what happened when we came for a birthday dinner one Saturday night in July. They were obviously understaffed in the kitchen, or should I say overwhelmed? One of our kids had to wait nearly an hour for his pizza-- apparently because they made a mistake and gave it to someone else, even though it was a special order. I asked for a burger without mayo, and when it came an hour later, it had a ton of mayo. I sent it back, waited 30-40 min, and it came back without any of their sauce. When I cut into it, it was burnt and inedible. At that point I was the only one in the party who had not eaten yet, and everyone was done. The manager apologized and didn't charge us for my burger, but I guess they were ok that someone came to their restaurant and sat there for 2+ hours, watched everyone else eat, and left hungry. To be fair we had better experiences in the past. But I am not returning or recommending this place to anyone. It could very easily happen to someone else, given the poor quality control in their kitchen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-frederick?start=80

It had a nice grill taste to the burger. I ate it on a gluten free bun, which was ok. I suspect the regular bun is much better. I also had a Tortilla Soup instead of fries. The soup was not the best I've had but very good for a gringo restaurant.

Emily M.,"Loudoun County, VA",8,24,30,2.0,10/10/2014,"I agree with previous reviews that say this place would be a lot better with some management/staff changes. I'm not sure exactly what needs to be done, but I've been here 6 or 7 times now, and I think only one of those times was both my food & service ok.  Sometimes the food is cold, sometimes the food takes forever, and for the fact that 'Brewhouse' is in the name, I have yet to talk to waitstaff that knows anything about beer. The last time I was there, our waitress said framboise was a 'style of beer' and it's called that because it's 'creamy'.  That aside, I keep coming back because it's one of the larger restaurants in Frederick, and since it's a chain, it's easy to get a group of people to agree to go there.

Like gyros with an excellent side of seasonal grains--great flavor. Like a jacked up taboullie (sp?)! The jalapeno burger was really good. Although overcooked and the bun got a little dry it had tons of flavor. It woulda been a 5/5, but still only dropped to a 4/5 due to the discrepancies. And the go-to BBQ chicken salad was as good as we remember from our Burbank, Cali days. Smaller and less chicken since '08, but the times man. Ahh a stroll down memory lane pre-08 meltdown.

Mike C.,"Rockville, MD",5,60,86,3.0,11/17/2014,"I've been wanting to try this restaurant for sometime now, and I finally did it. The interior was huge, with quite a few television sets to watch games. I was seated promptly and greeted by a waitress, who in actuality probably had not had much time on the job.  But that's fine. I know people have to start sometime. She was very nice and promptly pointed out the specials of the day. The only thing that I think was lacking about her service was not bringing me more napkins and not refilling my drink without being asked. Anyways, to the food. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with the wedge cut fries. It comes with a side of coleslaw. It also comes with a straw onions on top of it which made me wonder where I was going to even put the barbecue sauce because it was so high. The coleslaw was kind of odd because it was huge chunks rather than the shredded type that I'm used to, but tasted fine. The sandwich came with a little container of barbecue sauce which I poured on the sandwich and also put the coleslaw on top of it. I had my doubts at first, but once I tasted it they were erased. It was probably one of the best pulled pork sandwiches I've ever had. The meal was VERY tasty. For desert I had the Triple Chocolate Pizookie, which was a large chocolate cookie in a pan, heated, with chunks of Ghiradelli chocolate. It's then topped with 2 scoops of chocolate ice cream and a Ghiradelli dark chocolate square. Also VERY delicious. Overall, I highly recommend this place and look forward to trying some of their other foods. Give it a shot. Update: While I was there for my first visit, I signed up for their premium rewards program. I specifically asked the girl if my meal could be counted towards my points which is one point per dollar spent. She told me that would be fine but they needed to put it in at the end of the day. About a week later I went to the site to try and check on my point balance and found that I couldn't put a password in anywhere because I was not given one. I called their customer service and they said they were updating the site and that they would send me a new card which they did. They also sent me an email which showed I had a zero balance instead of the points I was supposed to receive. So I called again and basically their phone customer service act like they're doing you a favor. They told me they would have somebody call me back which never happened. They are really not helpful at all. In fact if you don't have a receipt which I didn't because it was about a month before, they won't add the points. I feel if I'm giving them my personal information to sell or whatever they're doing with it at least I should get something out of it. Basically I was very unhappy with their customer service and it still has not been resolved. I'm only asking for a mere 22 points! It's not like I'm going to lie about it. It's taking more time away from my day just to contact them three or four times in the past month. So now for the third time they've told me they'll have somebody call me back. We will see. They've had issues ""updating"" their website for a MONTH! Who does that? And as far as the points, I know if it was Amazon I was dealing with and I had the same problem they'd credit my points right away and probably send me some gift card or something to make up for the hassle. To be honest the food is really good in this place, but I've been so turned off by this whole experience I probably won't eat there again. It's a shame because I really like it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-frederick?start=80
Karri V.,"Frederick, MD",62,113,21,4.0,9/16/2014,"What a pleasant surprise! I was unsure what to expect because of the reviews for this place but we had a pretty nice experience for lunch on Saturday.   First, what the heck is going on with that hostess station? They formed a line of people waiting to be sat which would have been fine but we all just stood there for 10 minutes not moving. Those girls seemed really confused and in no hurry to fix the issue. It was just really weird.  Luckily, everything was smooth sailing after that. Our server, Courtney, was really sweet and professional. She seemed very knowledgable about the food and drinks available. We started with the spinach and artichoke dip and a few small plates for the table; those corn fritters were excellent. My husband and I each did a beer sampler. Being a dark beer drinker, I was surprised that my favs were all lighter (specifically the blonde). I look forward to trying more of what they have to offer.  All of our meals were really good and well prepared. My only complaint was with the shrimp on my pasta. They had absolutely no seasoning or flavor whatsoever and it really brought the whole dish down. Other than that, everything ordered was tasty. We will absolutely be back.

The one complaint I have is related to the call ahead seating.  During one of our visits with the family we did call ahead and were told 30 minutes.  So we arrive with about 5 minutes to spare, and were told that our wait would be about another 20 or so minutes.  When we explained that we did call ahead, they said that since more people had come in since we called, that our wait time had been pushed.  Somehow, in my mind, that's the whole point of having call ahead.  We weren't pleased but we didn't let it ruin our night. To me, call ahead folks should be given higher priority for planning ahead.  Hopefully it was a one time fluke and somebody just screwed up.
