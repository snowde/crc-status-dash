Daren C.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,24,8,1.0,12/18/2017,"Definitely not one of my favorite visits at this BJ's location.  We arrived here at 10:01p (see the attached photo of our parking validation) which means we were in the actual restaurant by 10:05p or so. We sat in the bar area where a server and a manager passed us every 5 minutes or so. After being here for about 20 minutes, someone approached us and asked if we needed menus. We said yes. 10min later someone came back to take our order. Fast forward to another 10min from there and we finally got our drinks. In total, that's 40min from the time we sat down to the time we got our drinks. At one point, the manager walked past and we grabbed his attention in hopes of expediting the experience, but that yielded no positive results. He said he'd have someone ""take care of us"". We still have not received an apology... No discounts are being requested and we don't want anything for free; a simple apology would've been awesome though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale
Sara M.,"Atlanta, GA",192,302,59,3.0,11/30/2017,"My dining experience here was a bit of a roller coaster but overall, our sever was such a sweetheart that he brings my rating up a star all on his own.  Here were the hiccups:  1) I understand it was game five of the World Series in which the Dodgers were playing, but they did tell me they could tune one TV on the patio to the Steelers prime time game. Unfortunately, it took them 20-30 minutes to finally get the TV to which they directed us to the right channel. They originally set a different TV to that game to accommodate the other Steeler Nation party on the patio. I wouldn't have minded moving if it hadn't been for the fact that we were seated way before they even showed up. So once they finally tuned the correct TV, they had the other party move to our TV area. 2) We ordered an appetizer sampler platter that came out after our entrees.  3) My steak was raw. Not rare. Raw. And worse, this was a ribeye, so the fat hadn't rendered out. I hate sending food back but I had to in this case. My other gripe regarding this was then being asked if I wanted a new steak or my old one cooked longer. Ehhh I think a new steak should have been the default action. But I just asked for the latter because I'm a chickenshit and didn't want to seem fussy. I guess I deserved the charred piece of meat that was brought back out to me. Now, as I said, our server was a total sweetheart. He handled all of the above-referenced hiccups in a friendly and professional matter. Even when I was starting to get antsy about the football game still not being on.  I'm not sure if they were understaffed (but really, during a Dodgers World Series game??) or just disorganized but this isn't the slam dunk sports-watching joint I was hoping it'd be. The food was mostly fine, though, so I'd be willing to give them another chance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale
Tuan V.,"Westminster, CA",0,9,1,3.0,11/10/2017,"-Waiting service was slow to say the least.  I could write more about the attitude, but I'd like to give the benefit of the doubt.  Seems like our waitress had a long day.  The service overall including the second person who waited on our table was very, very slow.  I grew impatient because I put enough money for 1h 45m in the meter, and the whole dining experience was pushing that time limit.  -Food was pretty good.  They got my order wrong, but I kinda enjoyed the order I didn't want.  My girlfriend enjoyed her clam chowder.  The bread bowl was excellent.  Dessert (monkey bread) was excellent and made up for some of staff's shortcomings. If anyone from the establishment is reading this, nobody likes waiting 10-15 minutes for the check to come out, and another 10 minutes to get it back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale
Sarni N.,"Los Angeles, CA",1731,41,361,5.0,12/14/2017,"BJ's is always a good place to eat and drink. We come here often. All the servers have been super nice. Food has always been good. Portions were just right - we were able to finish everything without feeling overly full and had room for dessert. And of course, the Pizookie (a soft cookie, baked like a pizza with ice cream on top -- it is sinfully delicious!) They have a good selection of craft beer! They have a great bar area with lots of screens. But overall, its a cool place to eat, watch games, and unwind after work.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale
Em H.,"Sun Valley, CA",203,386,151,4.0,1/2/2018,"BJ's has really grown on me over the years.  I've come to various occasions at this particular BJ's, and also just for a random lunch or dinner with friends, and I really like it.  The ambiance is pretty chill and modern-ish with their high ceilings and dim-ish lights.  Also, the staff has honestly always been very friendly and efficient, which I really appreciate.  The food is fairly well priced, especially when you add the coupons they send (through email or the mail), the rewards app points/deals, happy hour stuff, etc.  Their pizookie is obviously to die for, and their deep dish pizza is a killerrr.. I prefer this BJ's to the one in Burbank for the ambiance alone, although the one in Burbank has more convenient parking (this one has either street parking on Brand, or the lot behind the restaurant, which is free).  Definitely recommend it if you're in the area or have never been.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale
Shelia D.,"Glendale, CA",905,194,924,5.0,10/5/2017,"Our waiter was Jonathan and honestly he was fantastic. So happy and positive and very helpful. He told us that they had a promotion going on that offers $4 beers and $3 pazookie. Say wahhhhh?!? Of course we took advantage of that deal, especially since we found out it's for limited time only. I also ordered the Tuscan Tomato Bisque, the Spinach & Artichoke Dip and the Avocado Eggrolls. They all came out so fast and the tomato soup was so delicious. It came in a bread bowl and it was so delicious! I'm not a big eggroll fan big the avocado eggrolls were great. And so was the Artichoke dip.  The only sucky part about this BJs Restaurant is their parking. It is an underground parking structure behind the restraints built for the entire building which includes other businesses and restaurants. But I rather walk a little and have fantasy service and great food than the other way around. Plus we needed the ""exercise"" after all that delicious food. Now to think of it, maybe that's why they designed the parking that way, hmmmmmm?  Anyway, loved our service, loved our food, and can't wait to go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale

Alexa R.,"Granada Hills, CA",519,96,252,2.0,10/12/2017,"Unfortunately I did not have the greatest experience here. I love BJ's but not this location. I am about to go walk out of this restaurant. My friends and I came here for pizookies but Waiting one hour for one pizookie is pretty unfair to me. Our server sounded like she did not want to be there. On top of that, our order was forgotten so we had to wait longer than expected. I also was bummed that they didn't have a happy hour menu with food (at least we didn't receive one).  Plus side: $3 pizookies until 10/15!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale
Cyl J.,"Glendale, CA",314,297,740,4.0,7/18/2017,"The food is awesome here, but the service was lacking as usual. My friend and I decided to meet here yesterday for dinner. Parking is right around the corner by Islands and could potentially be free depending how long you stay and if you remember to get your parking validated. It wasn't crowded, so we were given a table right away. We asked the server for a few more minutes, but we didn't get our order in until maybe 10 minutes later and after this family behind us got their order in before us. Our food finally got to our table and I was quite pleased with the Peruvian Quino Bowl with Shrimp that I got. It was a good sized portion and very filling. Our server didn't check up on us often, so it took a while to get a water refill and to put our order of pizookie in for dessert. We eventually got our order in for a white chocolate macadamia pizookie to share and I was excited when it came to our table. It was a warm delicious cookie with two scoops of ice cream on top. BJs just needs to learn how to step up their service, especially when dinner service isn't that busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale
Jessica K.,"Burbank, CA",346,175,295,1.0,4/29/2017,"Jeeeeez no wonder I have never come here before. Well to this location. I decided to go because of the bogo meal deal.. but as soon as we sat down -- regrets. Took about 15 minutes for the waiter to even introduce himself and get our drink orders. Strike 1. Then we start waiting some more.. 30 more minutes go by then finally the food. THAT IS INCORRECT. I said no wontons on my Ahi Tuna Salad and of course the dish has a heaping amount.  They took it back and told me they accidentally brought the wrong one. and yes it looked like it had been sitting there for a while because the greens were wilted and soggy from the dressing.  GAH. It's a $16 salad I need it to be amazing. like really amazing. But no of course BJ's gotta mess it up.  OMGOMG almost forgot- this salad is supposed to have avocado and my salad had a whomping 3 pieces, 3mm in diameter. LOL gotta get technical when you skimp out on my avocado gg. $16 worth of greens basically.....  Plus the waiter was awks and barely checked up on the table. My bf's drink was empty 70% of the meal because it was so difficult finding the waiter to even try to wave him down. Never coming back to this location. So many better choices in the area.

Darien C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3015,223,141,5.0,8/27/2017,"Finally at my 200th Yelp review!! YAY!! It only seems right to review this BJ's location because the service we received last night was definitely five star worthy!  I usually go to BJ's because I love their pizza and pizookies. I've only been to this particular location once though and it was a few years ago. Yesterday I happened to be in the area because I wanted Porto's. Its literally right down the street from this restaurant and when deciding where to eat for dinner it came down to BJ's. Perfect! I put our party on the waiting list through the BJ's app and we set off in their direction.  One great thing about this restaurant is that there is a big parking garbage literally a few feet away from the entrance. You get two hours free WITH validation from the restaurant. So that makes it pretty convenient. You don't have to worry about circling around looking for parking since there is plenty of space in the parking garage.  So when we entered the restaurant I was actually shocked to see the waiting area empty! On a Saturday night?! It may have something to do with the fact that the Mayweather Vs McGregor fight was on this particular night and BJ's so happened to not be showing it so maybe people opted for the Buffalo wild wings down the street or maybe a bar in the area that was showing the fight. Nonetheless, there was hardly a wait for us.  We did wait for maybe 5 minutes or less but they gave us a nice booth for a party of three so that was pleasant.  We sat down and started looking over the menu. Even though i already knew what I wanted. Our waitress came around and introduced herself, I feel bad I don't remember her name! But she was attentive during our entire visit. She gave a long intro on the restaurant's most popular and most recent additions to the menu.  This particular location offers a child's ""appetizer"" consisting of a side of fresh fruit and I believe it was a garlic knot. Super cute and I'm surprised to see that they are the only location doing this! I've gone to quite a few other locations scattered across SoCal and none of them did this for my son. So I am glad to say that this location definitely has an advantage for this with little ones! It's nice that they added this feature with the kids meals. Now on to our appetizer. We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip. The waitress put in the order quickly and we were pleasantly surprised to see it come out very VERY quickly. However, upon eating it we discovered it had a very liquid texture and the dip was COLD!! We flagged down one of the other waitresses walking around and let her know the situation. She quickly took it back and said they would make a new one for us.  A few minutes passed and our waitress showed up going asking about our appetizer. We confirmed with her it was cold and she apologized right away, mentioning that she brought it to her manager and the cooks were making us a fresh one. Imagine our surprise when the manager, Demetri, came by our table and PERSONALLY apologized for the mishap with our appetizer. He mentioned to us that he suspected there was a step in the cooking process that was skipped.  He was kind enough to take the item off our bill. And even brought the new dish to our table himself. He was very kind to us and made sure our visit was nothing less than five star. Definitely the main reason I think so highly of this location now!  The rest of the visit was great! Our food was good. The service was prompt and I definitely look forward to coming back in the future should we be in the area. Demetri is a wonderful manager and he really does care about the experience his customers receive! Five stars all the way!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale

Got the 1610 calorie hickory brisket and bacon burger!!  Hooo, Decided to treat myself out from all the gym workouts and this burger does not disappoint.  Juicy sweet and tangy BBQ sauce, tender smoked brisket, applewood smoked bacon on top, all with melted jack and cheddar cheese, red onions and mayo.   And those fries...

We also ordered asparagus and by the time we got it, it was cold and undercooked. Very disappointing!!! The Manager did apologize and get my wife another steak, but we had to wait about 25-30 minutes to get it.

Bruce M.,"Northridge, Los Angeles, CA",212,92,171,2.0,3/9/2017,"Unfortunately, we did not have a great experience here. A group of 12 of us came here for lunch today during our lunch break. Now, we understand that with a group that size, our orders would take some time. However, we ended up waiting over an hour for our food and the restaurant was not overly busy. We ended up having to speak to 2 waitresses and the manager as we couldn't wait around forever. I will say that when the food did arrive, it was delicious. I got the soba noodles with shrimp and while the sauce was a bit too tangy, it was still scrumptious and filling for a meal.  I must also commend the manager who came by and apologized to each one of us, comped or beverages, and decided to cut our bill in half as an apology. While the initial experience was low and I have to grade it on that, the manager ended up bending over backwards to try and accommodate us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale

Elina A.,"Glendale, CA",10,23,12,1.0,10/22/2017,"This review is NOT for our server Kayla... she deserves five stars for her excellent customer service.  This review IS however for management to properly hire and train competent kitchen staff.  You are not preparing your servers for success at your restaurant if you do not have cooks who are preparing meals as they should be. There's only so much customer service   You can provide at some point the quality of the food is just as important if not more. The quality of the food that was served to me tonight with the most disgusting presentation of food I have ever tasted.  After a long and stressful day I decided to stop by for a very late dinner.... Order was simple enough, the Santa Fe salad and requested that the chicken be warmed up, I have this aversion with eating cold chicken. The waitress Kayla did her job, she put in the order and even showed it to my husband and I, ""Santa Fe Salad with fresh grilled hot chicken"" also ordered chicken wings with sauce on the side... food shows up, chicken is ice cold, and wings had sauce smothered.  To the kitchen manager, it is not that difficult to read, the instructions were there, customers make requests because they want to eat food that they enjoy. We don't have $$$ to just throw at some chain restaurant because are feeling generous.  So frustrating to ruin someone's appetite with incompetence.

Harry S.,"Glendale, CA",19,48,,1.0,12/14/2017,"Family and I had an utter nightmare dining experience here a month ago. I figured I would let the anger subside so I might approach a review with objectivity over sheer animus and rage. The rage and animus persist. It was that bad.  My 12-year-old insisted on eating here for his birthday. The host assured us we would have heat lamps if we sat outside, or would have to wait an hour to sit inside, even though it was empty. He couldn't explain why.  It was a cold night. Wife, three small kids, and I kept pleading, but the heat lamps did not arrive as promised. Instead, they put one about 10 feet form out table with a dim flame that gave no heat. We were freezing.  To make matters worse, we had a horrible waiter. Neglected the table, got our order wrong four separate times, brought us cold food, and a plate of food that looked like it had fallen on the floor and molded back together by someone with filthy hands.  We decided to leave mid-way through the meal. But, our waiter disappeared. I roamed the restaurant in search of the waiter or manager. Eventually found a manager that was dressed like a slob and completely useless and unapologetic.  We should have just walked out, but waited patiently for the check. When it arrived, it had a series of items we ordered, but which never came. We reminded our waiter these items never arrived and he repeated over and over, ""I will check on it.""' We couldn't wait out in the cold any longer. Paid the full amount, including about $35 of food that never arrived.  There was not one redeeming thing about this place. The food and service were awful. The restroom was filthy. Management was useless.  This now takes first spot for worst dining experience I have EVER had. Sadly, this will be the most memorable part of my kid's birthday.  My contribution today to the world: NEVER EAT HERE. IT IS HORRIBLE.

The only thing I would change is how tart it is. All the textures worked really well and everything was cooked just right. Like I said, there was a tartness to the dish I wish was not so tart.  Churros: AMAZING! Great idea! It's basically a plate full of tiny churros and ice cream on top. The churros were cooked fresh and perfectly crisp. Define a great change from the -sometimes , too sweet, pizzookie! Price: I thought the price was slightly overpriced, but it's what I expected from a chain/ corporate restaurant. However, the food was acceptable, so no major complaints.  I took two stars away because for the price they charge and being a corporate restaurant, I think they should have servers who can actually attend to their guest. Our server, like I said was a nice person, but she was just never around. Although food would have been 4.5/5 stars, service makes a huge impact especially when your family comes to celebrate a birthday and is paying $350+.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=20

Wendy L.,"San Gabriel, CA",377,7,1,1.0,12/13/2017,"Dishonest service from the waiter!! Be aware of how you split the bill. Our bill was $284, so we gave the waiter $275 in cash and told him to put the rest on the card. Well what we got back was a credit card charge of $50, which made no sense. We thought he included the tip as well, but we asked him and he said no. It was extremely sketchy, and we asked him to count it in front us, but he only counted $225. However we were certain we gave him $275, because we counted it beforehand. Be cautious of how you pay at this particular BJ's, either pay the exact amount in cash or put it all on the card. Don't split like we did or else you might get scammed! Never coming to this particular branch again.

Chuck D.,"Los Angeles, CA",654,1173,8494,3.0,8/23/2016,"I was craving a pizookie HEAVY... I havent had one, in literally DECADES. I dont know why but I was on a mission one recent Friday night and I just had to make my way to BJ's to have one. Good thing it closes late because we got there around 9/930pm. The place was busy as you would expect on a Friday night. We waited about 5 minutes before we were seated. We were given one of the elevated big booths which in retrospect didnt make sense, as we passed several open tables for 2 on the way to the booth. Oh well, we went with it.  Since we were on a mission for a pizookie we only ordered a couple of appetizers so we wouldnt get too full to enjoy dessert. We ordered the calamari appetizer that came with tartar sauce and cocktail sauce for dipping. I prefer cocktail sauce when eating calamari but sadly theirs was bland. It really lacked flavor. I didnt know why. The calamari was just ok. It wasnt the worst calamari I had but it certainly wasnt the best. I think the calamari could have been fresher. We also ordered the burger sliders app with crispy french fries. This was tasty as the sliders (2 with cheese; 2 without) were really good even though the burger patties were on the thin side. It was still real tasty though and the bread was good. The crispy french fries were great and went perfect with a little bit of ketchup. I would def order that again. The pizookie was GLORIOUS. It was better than I remembered it to be. We got the OG chocolate chunk with 2 scoops of vanilla bean ice cream on top. It was so good. The cookie still warm and soft went so well with a dollop of that delicious vanilla ice cream. Such a perfect dessert. Definitely needs to be shared by 2-3 people... Craving satisfied. Expectations exceeded. Service was ok. My empty water glass was sitting there for a while. I even put it at the end of the table which is usually the universal sign of ""fill me please"". We had to flag our waiter down to finally fill it. Another complaint I have was we used a Yelp check-in offer for a free pizookie with $10 spent on food. When we orginally got the check, the pizookie was on the bill. We had to remind our waiter about the supposed free pizookie and he made the adjustment to the bill and removed it. Glad he did but it should have been noted from the start that we had a free one that night. Anyway, those are the only things that come to mind service wise. Our waiter was friendly but just not as attentive as we would expect or prefer. Parking is in a pay parking structure. I think they validate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=20
Gem T.,"North Las Vegas, NV",13,147,218,2.0,9/1/2017,"Food was good, service from Julio and Tara was exceptional but we almost walked out of there before we even got to our table. So, here's my story. We got there at about 7:45 tonight, there was only one lady ahead of us so we waited patiently for our turn.While she was being led by the male host to her table, a couple ladies walked in and stood inline behind us. To our surprise, the blond hostess completely ignored us who were standing directly in front of her and proceeded to ask the ladies behind us how many were in their party. We got her attention and told her we were not with the earlier lady. She proceeded to tell us that the ladies behind us came before us. SERIOUSLY! When we told her we were there before them, she had the nerve to ask the ladies behind us if that was true and they both agreed we were there before them. Instead of apologizing for her mistake, she grudgingly picked up the menus, told us to follow her, stopped at a table and said your waiter will be with you shorty and that was that. I was left perplexed and fuming mad. If we didn't have a starving child, I would have walked out of there. I told our server what happened and she in turn mentioned it to the manager who came and apologized and said he will take care of it.  I appreciate that everyone was very apologetic but she totally ruined our night. I hope that this will serve as a learning experience for this young lady.

Thomas D.,"Los Angeles, CA",350,113,495,4.0,11/3/2016,"BJs in Glendale is one of my favorites stops for food and drink. The drink menu has a varying degree of choices from hearty & filling to healthy & vegan. The have an amazing Hickory BBQ burger that's one of my top burgers in LA. If you're a meat fan you have to get it! It's packed with ground beef, bacon and brisket.  This is also a cool spot to come check out a game at the bar. On my latest visit, Andrea was the bartender and did a great job with my drinks. The pazookie is another reason to come here! Nothing tops the warm cookie with a scoop of ice cream on top.  BJs is a great spot for your large events. We held a wedding rehearsal dinner here for around 30 people and it came out to around $500. They price you at about $15/person and the deal includes unlimited pizza, pasta and salad. What a steal!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=60

Shervin Y.,"Glendale, CA",424,106,162,3.0,4/14/2017,"We have been in the downtown Glendale area for 7 years now and rarely have we gone to BJ's on our lunch break. Last Thursday, we had a business meeting and couldn't agree on a spot so we all opted for BJ's as the safest bet. The two hosts were friendly enough and sat us at a booth near the bar. From what I remembered, there used to be a lot more TV screens everywhere but I've never been a fan of that unless it's a sports bar and you don't mind being distracted  from every angle while you're trying to focus on your food. Our waitress was nice enough. We ordered a mini Spicy Chicken Hawaian Pizza, Root Beer Ribs and Chicken Tacos. The Spicy Chicken Hawaian Pizza was prepared to perfection, it was warm and fluffy and had a fine balance of flavors. The Ribs barely had any meat on them and left an extra sweet aftertaste that made me feel a bit nauseous. Do not expect to be full after these ribs. I didn't have the chicken taco, but my friend was raving about them. Again, they didn't look like they would fill you up. That point was proven when  my buddy said he was starving just a few hours later. PROS - Validated parking - Friendly staff CONS - Inconsistencies in new foods on the menu. It's generally a good idea to stick with their classics.

On the inside, they weren't too busy, so didn't make sense. However, we had a large party and the patio was nice and spacious.  We ordered most of the shareables and the mini deep dish pizzas. The shareables was your typical bar food. The pizza is always great! The best part of the meal was the sea salt caramel pizookie. Wow. I've had pizookies... this one by far was my favorite.

The bartender was sooo stressed out. She took my order but walked away while I was ordering. I wondered if she heard me, but didn't want to ask for confirmation, it felt awkward like I'd be poking a stick at someone already annoyed.  The food was slow, when it came out, it was the wrong order. I told her that it wasn't correct, she said, ""I'll help you in a few minutes. I'm too busy now"". One of her colleagues said, ""I'll do it"" and took my order accurately. She did apologize and said it was her mistake.

Andrea M.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,,2.0,10/22/2017,"Poor house management.  -We ordered 2 large pizzas (simple, straight off the menu) and a salad.  -Food didn't come out for close to 45min later and pizza was cold, cheese had solidified and pan it came in wasn't even slightly warm. -Likely it was made within a reasonable time but had been sitting in the kitchen for a while before being served. Delivery pizza would arrive warmer than this. It tasted dry and like store bought frozen pizza.  -For a place that was originally founded in pizza, it was extremely disappointing to get such bad pizza. Not to mention the service, which was slow and rather inattentive. We had to ask for our check several times. We had validated 2 hour parking, and didn't even make it out in time.  -I've eaten at other BJs before years ago, and remember the pizza being great and served hot. Not sure if it's this location in particular or a change in their business model but definitely not the same anymore.  -Restaurant was fairly full as it's in a high traffic area, but having a continual flow of customers is no excuse for poor food and service. I noticed many tables full of people waiting for a while for food like us, without anyone coming by to check on them or apologize for the wait.  -It's pretty simple, pay attention to your customers and your product.

Jeanna M.,"Glendale, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/17/2017,"I have had the worse experience ""ever"" with my visit to your Glendale BJs Restaurant. I am extremely upset.  For the first time and last, I ordered two pizzas online for take-out at 4:39pm... the pizzas were to be ready at 7pm. I ordered the pizzas for a special occasion... I had people waiting for me. I arrived at the restaurant at 6:50. I spoke to the worker, Katherine. I showed her my order information on my cellphone. She stated that the kitchen was still working on my pizzas and they would be ready soon. I sat there in front of them and periodically asked if my order was ready. At least six people came and went with their take-out orders. People were going in-and-out of the dining areas.  Kathrine offered to have me pay while I waited, it took at least 20 minutes to get that correct. The manager, Armando Gonzalez, needed to come assist twice because it was done incorrectly (his fault). He came once and discounted only one pizza, then he needed to come back to discount the other. He should've got it correct the first time. The staff was running around like chickens with their heads cut off... disorganized, unprofessional, inappropriate, rude. The manager was just as bad as his staff, who he obviously does not supervise.  I waited in the restaurant for an entire hour (6:50pm to 7:50pm). There was one young male employee there, who looked at my husband and I (in the eye) and sang loudly... ""hit the road Jack, and don't come back here no more"". I should've got his name, not that it matters to me anymore... I will not be returning. Your restaurant is getting a very bad review from me and my entire family (who waited so long with horrible service). Additionally, I received my two pizzas after an hour of waiting... they were two, cold, uncooked pizzas. I live a block away. I walked a block to get home and open the pizza boxes to COLD, UNCOOKED, doughy pizzas. On my order, I specified that I wanted the pizzas ""cook well done"". After waiting in the restaurant for a full hour, you would think at least they would freshly and thoroughly cook them... but NO.  I literally feel sick. I am dissatisfied with the entire experience from beginning to at this moment. It is not over for me. I will continue to complain.. Again, it was by far the worst experience in my many years of life.  Dissatisfied",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=60

Ryan H.,"Lake View Terrace, Los Angeles, CA",1,4,1,1.0,7/20/2017,"Last night was the last time I go to the Glendale location. When my wife and I arrived on a Wednesday night for dinner we were told the wait was 20 minutes.  After waiting 30 minutes and noticing multiple open tables and multiple parties leaving, we asked why we hadn't been seated yet? We were then told 10 more minutes.  Once we sat down it took about 10 minutes for our server to come and ask for drinks. By this time we knew what we wanted to eat. Keep in mind the restaurant was not busy as there were 10-12 available tables just in our section.  I asked for cheese on my burger and got it without cheese, so the wait to eat was extended. At this rate we had been there for an hour.  A different server brought our food out, didn't ask if we wanted any condiments and just left. I tried to make eye contact with our server from a distance, once she saw our food had come out she turned in a different direction and didn't even bother to come and see if all was ok.  Our server approached the table next to us. At this point I was able to get her attention and ask for ketchup and ranch. We asked for two ranch sauces and got one. We asked for the second one and got it 10 minutes later.  After requesting for the check and providing my debt card we sat there for 10 minutes before our server took care of the bill.  While waiting for our server to take care of the bill  a party sitting next to us began to complain about the service. One person in a sarcastic voice said we got out napkins I'm sure it will take 30 minutes before we get out drinks. Overall it took us over 2 hours to eat and leave on a Wednesday night.

It wasn't too packed and our food came at a pretty normal time, yeah we did wait but not long enough to complain.  Our server was pretty nice, he gave us 2 free pizookies instead of one, not really going to give out a name incase a manager reads this and fires him or whatever since it was only 1 pizookie per table.  The food was pretty ok, not too bad and not too good. It's just like a whatever place. The prices are pretty good too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=40

I have visited a few times before today and felt that although they were not busy at the time, my previous waiters were not very attentive. They actually almost made me late getting back to work from my lunch break, which was pretty annoying. My 2 star rating is solely based upon those previous experiences.

Alaina V.,"Los Angeles, CA",31,27,1,1.0,12/26/2017,"I waited for the manager to follow through before I posted  this review of our horrible visit last week. While I can understand that the night we visited was very busy that does not excuse the lack of quality of the food, lack of cleanliness and unfortunate lack of service. Our table of 8 was sat fairly quickly and then for two plus hours we endured a fair number of just ridiculous errors. Food and soups were served cold (not even warm); wine glass served with lipstick marks then brought back with obvious marks where those lipstick marks were wiped away. The calamari appetizer was brought out - with the waitress explaining that the portion was much smaller than usual but we could keep it if we wanted to.  One of the kid meals was missing fries and I kid you not - they brought out a plate of fries in record time - and upon inspection by the child - there was ""stuff"" on the fries like it was from someone's else's meal or order - god forbid from someone's plate after they were done! The pace of service was unfortunate - and our waitress was very nice and apologetic. The only good parts of the night were the adult entrees - thank goodness!

Luther D.,"Pasadena, CA",4,13,,1.0,5/31/2017,"Other than being in a great location, I think this was the first BJ's experience that made me say ""Not this one."" Maybe because its all the same company, no one will care, but I will go on record for those who actually spend their money to expect more from what I this particular location offers.  Let me paint the picture if I may: Its a Tuesday (yesterday) and I walk in behind a 3 people in a group. Behind my party of 2 is 2 other parties. One party of 2 and another party of 1.  We all stand in the lobby waiting for someone to come greet us.  No one around. We all stood there for several minutes before one guy behind me proceeded to the table area to find someone who could seat the parties.  The young lady comes to the front with a look on her face like WE were bothering her. Like she was just there to get a check and did not feel like seating anyone. With no eye contact, she proceeds to tell each party that the wait would be five minutes. Now I must add that from a human perspective, its hard to believe that its going to take ANY time to seat these parties because you could see approximately 12 tables with no one seated. I mean, it looked empty.  But whatever. Now mind you, the couple behind me was a party of 2, but for some reason, whatever it may be, the young lady sat them before us. Why? I dont know, but I felt like that was kinda rude considering we were first. But whatever. Our server did his job....The first time. Not the second...or third. What do I mean? I mean he literally took our order and we never saw him again. Someone else brought our food and he never stopped by to check on our table. NOT ONCE. No water refills. No ""Is the food ok?"" Nothing. But again, for some reason, he made it a point to stop at the table behind us twice during their meal. Did I stink? Because I swore I was clean.  The ribeye was prepared properly. The broccoli looked like baby broccoli. The creamed corn was probably the best of the meal next to the one glass of strawberry lemonade that I had.  As I went to the bathroom, I overheard one guy at another table say ""he had been waiting over 10 mins and no service...WTF?"" But what was interesting was as I continued my walk to the bathroom, I saw 3 servers standing near a POS machine talking and laughing and another server in awe of the NBA highlights on the screen. yea...4 people, not doing their job.  Im very big on service. Food is a close 2nd but service first. The people working here dont seem like bad people.

Helen P.,"Los Angeles, CA",180,217,164,3.0,6/8/2016,"I've been to this location a few times and I have to say as much as I love their pizza, I don't really like their service. I came here yesterday with my coworker for lunch around 2pm. The restaurant was not that busy, there were a few tables here and there but the restaurant definitely wasn't crowded. We got seated by this guy at the front who kept mumbling- we could not understand what he was saying.  Our server was this girl who had a nervous giggle. Whenever we wanted to order something or ask for water she would giggle- it was odd (because really, nothing was that funny). My friend got the California Club lunch and I got the Unlimited soup and salad combo. I got the chili because I wanted something hearty and the mozzarella and tomato salad. In about 10 minutes my friend got his sandwich special first. I saw there and stared at him for a few minutes while he ate his fries, since he's a gentleman he was waiting for me to get my food so he can devour his. Several more minutes pass by and now we are wondering why ladling premade chili and a cold salad would take longer than a hot sandwich?  Finally several minutes later our server appears with my food. I was tempted to order my next round at the moment since it obviously takes forever for them to get it out but I resisted. She never returned to check up on us after we started eating. I finally caught her again and asked for the Caesar salad, they actually did give a decent portion of the chili so I didn't bother trying another soup.  My friend wanted to order dessert- he got the caramel and sea salt pizookie and I got my Caesar salad (which most of it was limp romaine by the way). We were on a bit of a time crunch because we were on our lunch break so we started getting worried when his cookie didn't come out. We also couldn't find our server anywhere and mind you the restaurant WAS STILL NOT BUSY. We had to flag down a different server so we could ask them to tell our server for our check- she finally brought it out and we immediately gave her our cards to pay. We also scarfed down the cookie because we were running pretty late at that point. I gotta say, I would not recommend this place if you are looking for a quick lunch, they seem to take their sweet time and can't really say the service was all that great....too bad because I still love their pizzas!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=100

We had previous ok experiences at the location in Woodland Hills but even at that location, food quality was declining over time as well as service. I have been coming to BJs for over 10 years but that time is over.  I would have given one star but the waiter was really friendly. I have to give this location 2 stars because the food was just NOT good at all. I would compare it to maybe Applebees or Chilis quality to be honest. I ordered the shrimp penne pasta. When the food got to our table, at first glance I could tell the food was reheated maybe or not prepared fresh but I was hungry so I dug in. I look through the pasta to see how much shrimp is in it and no lie there were literally 5 pieces of shrimp. I wish I took a picture. And not to mention, it tasted like Stouffers. I sent the pasta back and got a baked potato. Nothing else looked appealing on the menu except for the pizza. My husband ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken which it too tasted low quality, and had no flavor. The texture was just off and it was not fresh. The broccoli that came with it tasted like they opened a bag and threw it in a microwave. We also ordered calamari which was really good, thank God. I happened to look at the website while eating and saw a free appetizer deal which of course the waiter didn't mention. I was also able to use my Bjs rewards and for another $10 off. So saved about $25 that night.  In summary, food was garbage.

I've heard service is very slow at this one, but me and a group of 6 came in and gave it a shot. Normally I get the Great White pizza, but this time I wanted wings! We ordered, server was awesome and everything was great.  45 minutes in and we asked about our food and someone comes and hands only 2 of the hamburgers down (4 meals still not there). One is fine, and one is completely cold. Like clearly very old. So we politely asked to get it warmed up or remade and thought it was no problem. About 5 minutes later, the burger that was sent back came out and was COLD AGAIN and my boneless wings came and as per usual, I always use a knife and fork. I know, I'm weird.... but thank God I did. When I cut into it, it was completely RAW. Like not a little raw, I mean it hadn't even touched the fryer - RAW. It looked like it was tossed in batter and coated with sauce and plated, no sign of being cooked whatsoever.  I have never been so shocked at a restaurant. We couldn't believe it! I didn't even think to take a picture as I was just staring at a raw piece of chicken. What's even worse is I thought maybe it was just one of the wings.... but no... EVERY SINGLE piece was raw!!!! We got the manager and he was so shocked, apologetic, and comped the meal and offered something else. But with that, my appetite was shot.

As for dessert i shared a regular sized pazooki  which was a good combination of soft cookie and ice cream.

The girl who was there told us that the wait time is around 30 mins and I said okay. 30 minutes have passed and all the people who were ahead of us got all their tables. Most of them were parties of 2 and 3 people so it was understandable that they would get their seats first. A few minutes after, a surge of people came in with parties of 5 and 6. What was surprising is they both got their tables within 15 minutes of getting there and while we were stuck waiting for about an hour already. I talked to the the server and she said the tables are being prepared. I waited a few more minutes then I got back to her. She said the same thing so I gave her 5 more minutes and then we just left around 10:30 pm. We waited about an hour and 10 minutes. I personally think it has a lot to do with how our group looked.

We ate there tonight, and we had another problem. I ordered the spicy pig pizza, which is always good. However, when it FINALLY arrive (about forty minutes after I placed the order) the pizza was not even slightly warm. I'm not exaggerating. There was NO warmth to the pizza, not even in the center. I don't know how long it had sat out, but the pizza was stone-cold. I started to just eat it...after all, there are worse things in life than cold pizza. For whatever reason, I decided to complain (which is not something I normally do. I could count on one hand the number of times I've sent food back to the kitchen). Once I finally got the server's attention, he carried the pizza back to the kitchen and ran it through the oven again. When he brought the pizza back, the edges and bottom were burned...and the pizza was only lukewarm.  He offered to have a new pizza made, but by this time the rest of my party had finished their entrees. I just ate what I could, and left. It wasn't fair to expect my date to sit there waiting for another pizza to cook.  I probably wouldn't be making a big deal about this if it was the first time it has happened to me there. People can, and do, screw up. Since I can remember at least four times something similar has happened in the last two years decided to say something about it.

Barclay W.,"Saint Paul, MN",354,901,4,2.0,4/12/2016,"I have a love hate with BJ's restaurant. The nice part about BJ's is that, much like every other big chain restaurant, the food is fairly consistent wherever you go. No matter where you are you know what to expect from the food at BJ's.  That isn't to say the food is amazing. The food is what you would also expect of a large chain. Good, but not as great. Their menu is too large to ensure that they can produce every meal at the highest quality. Still the quality isn't bad and you always know what you are going to get from them. In that sense I kind of love this place because when I am in doubt I know I can grab something decent here.  What I HATE about this place is the service. The service at this location is a joke, both for takeout and dine in. I've done many takeout orders from here because my work is right above here, so it is a favorite lunch meeting spot. Almost consistently I know that there won't be anyone at the to go counter to help me. I've waited 5+ minutes for someone to come out and help me. Other waiters and the host(ess) have seen me waiting and do not say anything. There is also a good chance that the food won't be ready or the order will be wrong somehow. It does not reflect well on me when I am late with the lunch because they couldn't get their service together.  When I have eaten here for lunch the service has been just as bad. This place is basically empty when I've come for lunch, yet the service moves as though they are slammed. This place is right below where I work, so it is quick to get here. Still it can take over an hour to eat and leave because the service is just that bad. Thankfully there is a way to pay with their app now, so you don't have to wait the 15 minutes for your server to get your check.  I know I'll keep coming back while I'm here because this place is convenient and the food is passable. For anyone looking for a quick bite, there is much better and faster options around.  33/100",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=120

We were a party of 9, a mixture of kids and adults, going out for dinner after a show at the Alex Theater down the street. There was no one at the hostess station when we came in. We stood around for long enough that one person was walking into the dining room to get someone's (anyone's!) attention.  When the hostess did make her way over she was not particularly friendly. The wait for a table was reasonable but the service left much to be desired. Our server was friendly but it took a ridiculous amount time to get our meal. Even the grown ups were getting hangry. There didn't seem to be any sense of urgency, just one mumbled apology for the delay.  One of the desserts was wrong and the server assured us the correct one would be out in ""2 minutes."" Well, the correct one didn't come out until everyone had finished and we had already paid the bill. The correct dessert arrived literally one minute before we stood up to leave.

Alex N.,"Glendale, CA",6,43,1,1.0,12/28/2016,"I've been to the Glendale BJs several times already, since they opened for the first time, up till last night.  First time I went there, it was so unorganized as I noticed it was employed by a lot of high school kids (at least it appeared to be). Food wasn't as consistent or delicious as the one in Burbank, the one I used to visit before the Glendale one opened.  Many years later, things haven't changed.  It's still super unorganized and I probably will drive to Burbank to continue to eat at BJs, even though I live in Glendale. Last night, my wife and friend came to the Glendale BJs and ordered the Xmas special (with shrimp, ribeye, cesar salad and tortilla soup), balsamic chicken, and the late night burger.   The cesar salad and soup came out 20 minutes AFTER we ordered it.  The waitress (i forgot what her name is but she was very friendly) said the soup ran out and they had to make a new  batch.  But when my appetizers arrived, the soup wasn't even warm..it was almost cold! The balsamic chicken was super dry and tough and we really needed to knife at it to break it up.  The burger was ordered medium and came well done.  It took 15 more minutes until after we finished our meal to get our pizookie, which the cookie came super hard and the metal round dish it came in was almost cold as well.  The cookie so so hard that it broke in pieces when we dug in it, instead of being able to use a spoon and grab it like butter.  They were trying to deliver other pizookies and food to us that we did not order, or already had, so we saw how disorganized they are.  We overheard another party complain about how long their food took as well and they complained to the general manager.   This was unacceptable service and the only good thing about the dinner was the waitress who was friendly throughout the night.  I will continue to go to the Burbank one as this branch has not changed since my bad first experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=140

I honestly never expected to eat here but I made a new acquaintance in the neighborhood and she suggested going here.  The service here is kind of strange. I don't want to say it was bad because my server offered advice and suggested the happy hour menu which saves us both money.  We moved to the bar to take advantage of the reduced pricing. At that point it got weird because he didn't give us a happy hour menu. He returned to see what I wanted and I asked what the heck was on the menu. He said he didn't have  one but could tell me. How do you NOT have the menu. Weird. He showed me the beers that are discounted but that was of no use to me. I had already ordered a lemonade. I thought, why did I move over to the bar?  So with the minimal info he gave I got the pepperoni flat bread and bbq wings. The food was great. This the 3 stars. But, why didn't we get any napkins or silverware? So he came by to see how we were doing and I asked for napkins and utensils. He returned with a stack of tiny, square bar napkins. It was like I was at a food truck.

It was just a thick piece of dough with what seemed like a bit of cheese and absolutely no sauce. Thank god I asked for tomatos, mushrooms and olive or there would be nothing but dough. Truly crap. They should be embarrassed to put that out. I'm embarrassed for them. My husband picked it up curb side and had to talk to three different people just to get it.

They've known about this reservation for weeks, and still did nothing about the pitiful state of their heat lamps.  Also, parking sucks here, you have to park in another structure and walk a significant distance, not good for my 90 year old grampy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=80

We've had long waits for food even when the place is empty like it was tonight.  Told the waiter to put an order in for the kid's pizookie in 5 minutes since the waiter said it can take 5-15 minutes for them to make it.  It took a half hour.   They never put my rewards number for the check like they usually do when I give the number to the hostess.   And the usual: took forever to get the check. Waiter never asked how our food was.  Never asked if we wanted anything else until I was signing the check.  Also, the waiter twice forgot to take the Monday night discount off the pizza.   We're never going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=80

She wouldn't look at me or talk to me. She only every responded or talked to my friend and would actually look at her. Not sure if it's because I'm a man? Maybe she thought I was someone else? Maybe she didn't like that I had some tattoos & piercings. I don't know. I just do know that this was the worst service I've had since I've been in high school. Food would have 5 stars.

Carmik T.,"Gilbert, AZ",70,384,751,3.0,2/26/2017,"Came in about 3:30 yesterday afternoon.  Parking is somewhat complicated, parking garage closest it's $1 every 15 minutes! We decided to park a little further away ( a few blocks) set the meter for 1:45 mins. We arrived at Bj's; I had to use the restroom prior to sitting. Both sinks faucets were on & one of the sinks was almost over-flowing! I tried turning them both off ( after I washed up of course) neither one would completely shut off. As I left the restroom, I approached one of the servers ( sitting on a bar stool @ the bar) & told her about the issue!  The restaurant didn't seem to busy, but our server Racheal; we noticed had quite a few tables in her area. However, ""all in all"" the restaurant during that time wasn't crowded by any means. In fact, we also noticed one of the chefs was either on his lunch break or off work as he was seating in a booth on the computer while we dined. Ordered our drinks when Racheal came to greet us. My daughter & myself got the Mango Lemongrass tea, my husband got the Sunset Peach Fusion $2.95 each. Neither seemed to be that ""spectacular in flavor"" for the price. We got our drinks fairly quick, although when asking for sugar that took a bit! We ordered a Large Caesar salad to split & a bowl of clam chowder. Our main Entree was a large pizza. In looking at the receipt (after), it also stated that the soup was a main entree? Ok!! Anyway, the food took some time to arrive.  The salad was presented first, that was good. The soup arrived with the pizza & was less than luke warm & less than satisfactory! The serving size very disappointing for $6.75 ! No complaints on the pizza!  Our daughter had the kids meal & for the price /portion, the best deal of the day! $6.25 that was less than what they charged ($6.75) for that lousy soup.. LOL Our girl really enjoyed the honey mustard dip that came along with the chicken strips!  Over all disappointed with the service & the cost. Our daughter had to use the restroom after we ate and I accompanied her. The sink issue was still a problem. The faucet my daughter used was HOT & slightly burnt her skin when she put her hands under the sink. Urrgg!! Fix it!!  BTW- By the time we returned to our vehicle the meter time had almost expired. Glad we fed it all those coins for that full amount of time we spent dinning..LOL",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=80

However, we got seated at our table and it was pretty dirty with multiple visible food particles. The waitress was very nice and friendly but then the water cups and plates came and they had dirty stains as well. We let them know about the table and they apologized and cleaned it but it was still dirty. I guess we just gotta let them know, maybe they were really busy. I kind of wish they can take some clorox wipes every morning and wipe all the  pages of their menus down. The menus were so sticky and gross. When I first opened mine, it literally made me lose my appetite. I saw pieces of some greens, like lettuce and parsley, stuck on some of the pages and it was such a turn off. My friends and I were really hungry and it was pretty late, so we sucked it up and stayed. I just wish they can read this and learn something from it. The vegetarian deep dish pizza was very salty but still delicious so we did finish it haha!  They have a big bar and the restaurant is spacious so it can handle big groups of people.

Food calamari: pretty good. fried food, how can you possibly get this wrong. Nice and crispy.  mozzarella sticks: cheesy and nicely spiced. underwhelming though and can't justify it's price tag for damn cheese sticks. portobello strips: delicious and crispy. of course nowhere as good as Bottega Louie's but I'd definitely order this again. chicken lettuce wraps: garbage. I wouldn't eat this again. it's the white man's version of chinese lettuce wraps with large, nasty chunks of chicken breast. strange, strange mix-ins like celery and wasabi dressing. far from a culinary feat.

That was it that was all she had to say.  Did not answer the question I asked and also did not seem to care.   Since there was some confusion (because the website indicated that they serve breakfast until 2 PM) the manager kindly offered to let us order from the breakfast menu.   Again, the waiter was extremely nice. But then the kitchen got the order wrong!  Waiter was apologetic but did not offer to fix, and manager never came back to the table to see how our visit was.

Beer:  The Red Ale they have here is very good, I also enjoy the hefeweizen they offer on tap.  BUT... The absolute best tasting (and high potent) beer I have ever enjoyed in my life is the winter seasonal beer they offer ""Grand Cru"", simple excellent.  I refer to it as the ""Nectar of the Gods"", it is similar to Chimay but without the bitterness, and it has a sweet aftertaste.

Tu-Anh N.,"Oakland, CA",918,461,3553,5.0,1/1/2014,"Hands down the best BJ's experience I had!  And I owe I all to Latanya (Tanya).   Her service was over the top stellar and this was on a super busy new year eve night!although she was swamped she had such a positive and enthusiastic energy!   As soon as we sat down she immediately told us she will get to us.  When she did as promised she told us all her recommendations on beer, appetizer, pizza and entree.  It's always nice to hear those. I ordered some water with no ice.  Tanya came back with my water with no ice AND a bowl of lemon wedges, something I forgot to ask!  She also came back with a sampling of soups: clam chowder, tomato bisque, and chicken tortilla.  Sweet! I wanted to have a drink since it was new year eve!  Tanya gave us her recommendations and brought me out 3 samples of beer...woot! Unfortunately I had already planned on a cocktail and decided to get a: WHITE PEACH MARGARITA - $9.25 This drink was very sweet but since it was served over ice in a tall glass, I figure I can take my time on the drink and let the ice dilute it a but.  The sugar rim was nice but unnecessary since the drink was already so sweet.  I appreciated the peach garnish and then noticed more sliced on the bottom!  When I took a bite into though I instantly got a brain freeze, forgetting that this peach slice has been sitting in a pool of ice! Haha!  I ended up not finishing this drink because even about 2 hours my margarita was still too sweet and I was not in a mood for a sugar headache later. We decided to go for the holiday special where we get 2 appetizers (salad or soup), 2 entrees from a selected list, and a pizzookie for $35.  Here's what we chose: HOUSE SALAD it's one of those dishes that will make you feel less guilty when you main entree that is a burger comes out. In reality, this salad holds no nutrients.  Maybe there are some in the shredded carrots, but all this plate hold was lettuce and purple cabbage and ranch sauce...which is quite unhealthy, haha.  Oh there are tomatoes, too.  Yeah don't get a house salad.  Cesar salad is probably no better. TOMATO BASIL BISQUE Because of that soup sampling we had I chose this and it delightful! It was tangy enough, salty enough with that nice sweetness of tomatoes and that richness taste we know from creamy tomato soup! I loved it!  I should have gotten 2 of these instead of that house salad. BALSAMIC-GLAZED CHICKEN Our marinated chicken breast grilled and served over baby field greens, caramelized onions and white cheddar mashed potatoes and drizzled with sweet balsamic glaze. I went straight to the mashed potatoes!  I loved how the white cheddar made it rich an creamy!  It complimented the balsamic glazed chicken so well!  The onions was like the icing on the cake!  I'm not usually a fan of grilled chicken breast because it always comes out dry to me.  But the glaze and mashed potatoes helped.  Oh and the greens was way better than the house salad haha. FRESH ATLANTIC SALMON - Blackened Flavorful fresh salmon fillet either flame-broiled or blackened. Served with rice pilaf and vegetables. Tanya gave us 2 options on how wed like this to be cooked: blackened, New Orleans style with spices but not spicy, or just grilled, which she says is still good.  After elaborately explaining to us how blackened is and that she is from New Orleans, we went with that one! We were so pleased we did!  The fish was amazing!  The butter sauce complimented it well and I love sauces.  The fish was NOT dry and that's a common reason why I never order fish at a western restaurant, but I am glad I did this time! PIZOOKIE - CHOCOLATE CHIP I Requested the vanilla bean ice cream be served on the side instead of on top, that way I can take home the rest of the cookie I don't finish!  The cookie is always perfect to me: warm, GOOEY, and half raw!  Always plenty if chocolate chips!  The ice cream was yummy too but I was too full to finish it. I enjoyed the dinner for the most part but the reason why I am giving my 5 stars was because Tanya!  She made me laugh so much!  She clearly hardworking, enthusiastic, I love how friendly she is and is  so charming!  I've been to various BJs many times and this was my favorite visit!

It wasn't terrible, but it was definitely sub-par compared to the other BJ's i've visited. Firstly, our waiter never came back to ask how the food was or to refill our drinks. And we couldn't even track him down the entire meal to ask for refills. Finally he showed up after everything was done, nice to see you again buddy. That was pretty lame customer service if you ask me. Secondly, our food was just not that good. I tried the new lasagna which didn't look like the photo AT ALL. For the sake of this review, I counted how many sausages were in my lasagna... 3. Absolutely ridiculous. The cheese was pretty tasteless and the tomato sauce was really overwhelming.... pretty much the only thing you could taste. My friend's crusted chicken was reallllly chewy as well.

The thick crust pizza was one with a bunch of toppings. Dough was also disappointing. The saving grace was the jambalaya and fries. The jambalaya was only good because it was loaded with chicken/shrimp/sausage. Other than that the flavoring was just okay, as was the rice pilaf under it all.

First, refills were slow to come, so we sat for most of the time with empty waters and sodas before having to ask for more. Then there was a mix-up with the sandwiches when a friend who ordered no bacon still got some, and then had to ask that the kitchen remake it when they just brought back the same sandwich with the bacon peeled off. Another friend didn't even eat her jambalaya because it was incredibly salty. Then, I tried to arrange with our server to get the free birthday pizookies as a surprise, and for the flavors to correspond to whatever the birthday people picked off the menu. We ended up getting too many pizookies? Rather than just bringing the birthday flavors based on what flavors were ordered, they brought the birthday pizookies PLUS two additional regular pizookies that we had to pay for. Oh well.

We are usually understanding about our waiter/waitress having a bad day because we have worked at restaurants for years. I don't even think he was having a bad day because he was rather communicative and friendly with other tables. It started with him forgetting to bring us a diet pepsi. Then, my sister spilled her drink, it definitely made loud enough noise for everyone to hear; however, he was too busy chatting with his co-workers to notice it. Her napkin was completely wet, and he doesn't offer to give her a new one. He did bring her a new drink, though. He never checked to see how we were doing (we were there for an hour and a half) when my brother's 1/4 left diet pepsi looked like iced tea because he needed a refill 25 minutes ago. When we finally asked for a refill, he took 11 minutes to bring him a diet pepsi after we were done eating everything. He brougnt us our check even before we asked for our check or refill for my brother's diet coke. He never smiled when he had no problem laughing with his co workers, he unnecessarily circled the suggested tip amounts, as if my brother didn't know how much to tip.

Mary H.,"Alameda, CA",1,18,,3.0,12/24/2016,"Turning out not to be the best stay in LA from a service perspective. The food here was classic BJs. Our group had ribs, clam chowder soup, jalapeño burger and salads. The food was good. The service not so much. I was seated first, while the other two members of my group were parking the car.  Although the restaurant was nearly empty at 5:30pm, I waited 20 minutes to be seated. No big deal. It took our server a while to get to the table, but when he did, I ordered our drinks and told him the rest of the group would be there shortly and we knew what we wanted. It took him another half hour to get back us. By then, the three of us had been sitting there with empty drinks for about 25 minutes. He placed our order and then that's the last we saw of him until it was time to order dessert. In contrast, the guy who brought us our meal from the kitchen was superb. He asked us how our food was, refreshed our drinks twice and brought us needed condiments. Where was our waiter? Catering to the table next to us who ordered tons of drinks, appetizers and dessert. He killed them with good service and kindness., while ignoring us completely. I should mention that I reluctantly complain about servers because I know what a tough job this is and what they have to put up with. In fact, we try to be as polite and flexible as possible to try and make up for rude patrons we have seen. This time the service couldn't be overlooked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=260

First and foremost, BJ's Pizza has seen a severe decline in the way it does business. I went there tonight to have a nice, warm meal and what I received was a Luke warm atrocity. I ordered the ribeye steak with a side of chili and pilaf. The entire meal, and I mean the entire meal, was like warm at best. When the chili was brought out, it was getting close to being a gazpacho. I asked the server to please reheat the chili and I never saw that bowl of chili again.  Almost sounds like a song. Then came the main course and that was not even quite like warm. I ordered a ribeye medium well and it was almost rare. The rice pilaf was awful and not even warm either. Never going back there again, girlfriend was mortified. Also, to make matters worse, I had to get out of my chair just to let them know that the dish was cold.  Awful place, awful experience, done with BJ's forever.

Nora G.,"Sun Valley, CA",1,2,,2.0,5/19/2017,"I went to this BJ's with my niece and her son, on Mother's Day, as a second choice because we couldn't do the 2-21/2 hour wait at a busy restaurant at the Americana. We got to BJ's at around 8:45pm, there was no wait, and we were seated at a table with no silverware or napkins. We didn't think much of this, but about 45 minutes later when the food finally arrived (we were occupied with conversation), we realized that we had nothing to eat it with. It took a few mins to get our waitress's attention, and then another 10 minutes for her to come back with a refill of a drink, but with no place settings. When I reminded her, she said ""they're rolling them right now"", which drew laughter from us but also frustration, because we realized that there were no table settings on any of the empty tables around us. Oh and also my niece's soup in a bread bowl came lukewarm and had to be sent back, and the wait for food & service was way too long, and the floor was being ignored--paper napkins lying next to our table, along with a fork and various ""scraps"" just left under & around the tables.

The first call, they hung up on me after putting me on hold. Second call and I was on hold for 5+ minutes. I hung up, called a third time and let the person who picked up the phone know that I was having a hard time placing an order, and could he please just take down my order. The guy responded, ""Sorry I am the host so I cannot take your order for you."" So finally, a woman picked up after I was on hold for a good 3 minutes. When she asked me what type of fries I wanted, I turned to my coworker and asked him what he wanted, and she was extremely rude and said ""HELLOOO?"" Uh... If it takes me 3 calls and countless minutes to get ahold of you, I'm sure you can wait 5 seconds for me to get back to you on what fries I want to order.  My coworker picked up the order and came back. My coworker's order was completely wrong. We asked for the Grilled Chicken Club Sandwich with a cup of broccoli cheddar soup, and they didn't even give us the soup. I also specified TWICE for no bacon, and they still put bacon in the sandwich.They also did not provide any ketchup for our fries.  My order, the New Orleans Jambalaya entree, was super greasy. The entire bottom of the plate was covered in a thick layer of grease.  Am definitely not coming back to this location again.

Rita W.,"Rockville, MD",527,337,1553,3.0,3/29/2011,"BJs can be a yey, a nay, or a meh, it's just alright. Yeah, it kind of hits the whole spectrum, depending on luck. The food has a lot of potential to be ZOMGWTFSOEFFINGGOOD, but hey, that's why there's alcohol, right?  Anyways, I usually get some appetizers, a burger or pizza, or whatever here, since it's a pretty standard place. I've also had some drinks and their cider, which was good. Can't go wrong with some ethanol content unless you're allergic or pregnant and whatnot.  The food I've had seemed rather consistent. Their avocado eggrolls are good if you like your avocado eggrolls pure avocado (I uploaded a picture for you awesome yelpers and lurkers to see). They are a bit more avocado-y than the Cheesecake Factory avocado eggrolls, but they are nothing compared (not in a bad way; in fact, I do prefer the avocado to the non-avocado) to the CPK eggrolls because the CPK ones are filled with a bit of avocado and a bunch of non-avocado, such as bacon. But yes, the name avocado eggroll doesn't lie at BJs.  One buddy once ordered one of BJs burgers, but he had to send it back because apparently it was super gross and inedible, but I'm not to judge, since I didn't take a bite of his food.  The prices are pretty standard - more pricey than fast food, cheaper than Olive Garden for the most part.  Service can be either good, okay, or bad. I've had all three. It's a good place to go with friends to grab some drinks and share a bunch of appetizers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=300

Turns out it was the same burger I cut, because I cut it again, and it was just as raw as before, lol. ""cut it yourself"", gimme a break.

The restaurant was not busy as it usually is so our wait time seemed longer than it should have been. When the waiter finally asked us for our drinks he returned with all but 1 he had forgotten. As he later took our meals, he didn't right it down and ""memorized"" all our orders. My Cesar salad arrived first and the bowl was half way full. The lettuce was so old with black spots and croutons where stale. I asked for a fresher salad and the waiter was really nice about getting me a fresh salad. We also ordered the queso and salsa verde dip with chips which was amazing except for the chips included more chip crumbs than chips. The waiter again was nice enough to bring extra chips. First, someone came to drop a guacamole burger which none of us had order. The person was so angry when none of us claimed it because none of us had ordered that.  When the meals we actually ordered arrived, try were wrong either we ordered wedge cut fries or thin cut fries and all were wrong. Again this was brought to the waiters attention and he was nice enough to bring the correct type. Food ended up being really good but experience wasn't as pleasant as its always been. Idk if the really manager wasn't there or if something was just off but usually everything is always perfect at this BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=320

Bernard L.,"Los Angeles, CA",35,48,11,4.0,9/27/2015,After 4 years I decided to give the Glendale location another try. You can't stay mad forever right?  To say things are slow at the Glendale BJ's location would be putting it mildly. There are maybe 20 people in the whole restaurant watching various football games.  The waiter (who was handling all the tables) was nice and courteous. He got my order promptly and checked up on me frequently.  I think I will start making the Glendale location a regular stop during football season. I hate crowds and this place is definitely NOT crowded.  I have always enjoyed BJ's during football season for their beer but I tended to favor the Burbank location for their service. In the past I have been disappointed with the Glendale spot but hey have turned me around.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=320

Casa De Aurum ..,"San Fernando Valley, CA",0,95,132,3.0,11/11/2014,"I normally enjoy eating at BJ's in Glendale,  Ca; especially during my lunch time with the ordering ahead online option.  I always have great service & if ever there's an issue,  it is always taken care of.   A few weeks ago, we (6 co-workers) went there for lunch and had a perfect example of poor and in adequate service.  We were seated immediately as there was very few tables in use.  We have a 1 hour lunch breae & we showed up at work 2 1/2 hours later!   It took 45 minutes to get our food and still some orders were incorrect & incomplete.  When the servers brought out our food and we brought the errors to their attention,  their responses were always let me get your waitress.  Our waitress wouls always come....about 10 minutes later.  When we told her what was wrong, she would just acknowledge by saying okay.  Eventually the items came out.   This was not the end of it.  When the bill came, we all looked at the price of our individual meals and pitched in an extra $ 2 for tax and tip (cash & credit card). The waitress came back saying that she did not charge anything yet because we were still approximately $60 short.  We were astonished and could not understand why but just for the sake of getting out, a few of us put additional money in to cover the cost difference.  At that point, we really started to review the bill we noticed there was additional items that did not belong to us. We informed the waitress of this discovery and her response was:  oh I see what I did.  I'll get that corrected.  She came back with a new receipt & removed our drinks for the error.  She came back with the corrected bill, the credit card receipts and then questioned the additional $27.  She actually had the nerve to ask if the remaining balance was her tip.  At that point we were just waiting for a simple apology on her part and it never came. I can only hope that this waitress was new & did not know what she was doing. However, that was not the case.  She was so unenthusiastic, looked like she really did not want to be there and did not care about the service she provided.   I hope that if management of the BJ's of this location - Glendale, CA & on Brand Blvd. reads this review they will have a serious conversation to their staff and in particular this waitress whose name is Andrea.  If you are seated in the section of waitress Andrea, I would highly suggest us to sit somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=320

Bigger crowd, but nonetheless, they were able to accommodate us. The waitress was sweet at the beginning, but she began to develop some major attitude as the dinner progressed.    Sure, we were a bit loud, but last time I checked I wasn't at the public library. She also brought the check when we were nowhere ready to leave. Cool.    One of my friends asked if she could split the bill, and homegirl grunted SO loud that we all paused for a second.    Sorry - did you not want to do your job?

Sometimes they even lower it even more for whatever bizarre reason. I really like to see the people I'm around and what I'm eating, thank you very much. They do serve some great food, but that doesn't ignore the fact that your customers should have to wait so long just to order.

This location in particular is the problem. I have been to a 5 star BJs and it was great.  One experience in particular was when I ordered the Chicken Alfredo. Everything was fine except the two very stale breadsticks. I kindly asked for some fresh breadsticks, and I kid you not, they brought back two bricks for breadsticks. Sadly, no one on my table had the jaw strength to eat these burnt one week old bread.  I didn't mention anything to my waitress instead laughed at my buddies trying to bit into rock hard bread.

Everything was delicious (plus with 2 HH orders 10 wings total for $8 can't beat that in LA) the wings were crispy and meaty. The avocado egg roll was yummy I don't love the sauce that comes with them I wish it was spicier and less sweet but that might just be me.

If you're here just to get a beer or two it's definitely not worth the trip or the money for that matter. Happy hours fall on such ridiculous times especially if you're working so you can expect to pay full price pretty much everytime you're there. However, if you're here for a party or the food they've got some bomb options you can choose from. I used to always get the Avocado Egg Rolls as an appetize, grab a meal like the BJ's Jalapeno Burger and wash it all down with a Porter. It's rather pricey here too so you can expect to drop around $30-$40 for a full stomache. Portions are big but honestly it's worth it. Service here is below average... even on less busier nights I'd find myself waiting for a simple glass of Blue Moon or even water for up to 30-45 minutes. The servers are friendly but the service itself is not worth the trip or tip for that matter. BJ's was always a fave place of mine, and they have always served me with a smile on their face so it has earned 3 stars in my book.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=340

Average food, average service, average ambience. Today I went to watch the Euro League finals and the TVs crashed around the 35th minute. They came back around the 45th minute without audio and the main TV never came back on. The TVs kept crashing and we were forced to wait 5-10 minutes at a time before the TVs would come back on. I missed at least a quarter of the game because of that. When I complained to the waiter, he and management did absolutely nothing to compensate for the issue. My sole purpose in coming to BJs today was the watch the game with friends but that didn't even successfully happen. I would have been better off watching the game at home on ESPN. Today, I'm a disappointed customer and I would like all Yelpers to know about this atrocious experience.

Nick T.,"Glendale, CA",136,310,116,2.0,4/13/2014,"How this place remains in business baffles me with Cheesecake Factory down the street. We placed a take out order using their mobile app. because we felt like having their nachos, barbecue ranch salad, and avocado egg-rolls.  We discovered the nachos had recently been canned from the menu so when we called to cancel, the guy said he will do the nachos. Fast forward $40: Nachos: Portion size was RIDICULOUSLY small. There was hardly any cheese, no sour cream or guacamole, just a few pieces of chicken, a few beans and chopped tomatoes, some weird sauce, and that's pretty much it folks. Now that I recall, I got better nachos at Taco Bell for god's sake.  Salad: Again portion size was RIDICULOUSLY small to the point that it looked like a $5 side salad. Straw that broke the camels back was that they used iceberg lettuce....WOW. Charging more than $12 for a side salad and you couldn't use Romaine.  Avocado Rolls: They were pretty good considering the other stuff hence the reason they get an extra star.  Overall, I hadn't been to BJ's since Cheesecake Factory opened in Glendale and now I know why. Cheesecake charges about the same for the above items but you get better qualify food coupled with larger portions.

Coworker and I decided to come here to this branch for happy hour after a long shitty day of work. Stoked, we plan out our meal on the way there, beer included. Oh, and possibly a pizookie if we weren't too full.  Our excitement ended far too quickly when we:  1.) didn't get greeted. A ""hello, how are you?"" Would've been sufficient.  2.) our table didn't get cleaned, we had to flag someone down to clean off the table and ask for menus.  3.) took forever to take our order. 4.) food took forever to come and finally when it did...  5.) we had to ask for utensils and plates.  6.) no one came to ""check up"" on us or ask if we needed anything.  At this point, coworker and I are beginning to feel like they're probably not paying attention to us became we're minorities. Mind you, the bar area is not crowded and other tables were getting served. The food was decent, but the service really messed up my mood and appetite.  All in all, this visit to this branch was whack. I've been to other bj's locations and their service is stellar compared to these knuckleheads. We spoke to Danny, the manager during that shift, we came around 6pm-720pm. I felt sorry for the guy. His wait staff sucks. Danny did however, knock off some appetizers which brought our bill down from $32 to $22. And Lee, who I overheard was supposed to be our waiter should probably look for another job.

VERY knowledgeable, and good upseller. def an asset to the company, and the parties that are assigned to her section are lucky. HOWEVER, on other occasions, i find that i have to wait too long for soup refills (when i get the soup/salad combo), or the check takes like 30 years to come out, which is unacceptable regardless, but esp bad when you're on a time restraint (uhh like your lunch break?).  no complaints about the free pizookie that comes out on your bday though :) and their mini pizzas are good. actually so is their mac n cheese. and their tomato mozzarella salad. ok fine, im a pig and everything here is good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=400

Nate J.,"Los Angeles, CA",56,35,4,1.0,5/11/2013,"I have been to many B.J's before but have never made it to this one until today.  We arrived at around 3:30pm and, not surprisingly, the place was rather empty.  We get seated quickly, met with a waitress quickly and order quickly.  Everything is off to a great start.  Sad thing is is went all downhill from there. We ordered an appetizer, took about 10 minutes to come.  Not bad.  We ordered 2 pasta entree's, that took another 20 minutes.  Kind of long, but I will forgive them because I was watching the game.  Girlfriend bites into her pasta, stone cold.  I bite into mine, pipping hot.  Basically this means they made hers immediately after ordering and it sat there for a good amount of time.  We grab out waitress and ask them to reheat it.  I finish my entire meal before it comes back.   At this point we have been in the restaurant about an hour and we, regrettably, order a Pazzookie.  For those who don't know what that is, its this ungodly amazing dessert where they serve an under cooked cookie in a pan covered in melting Ice Cream.  This is where something very peculiar happens.  Earlier a different waiter than the one we ordered from brought our food to the wrong table.  I note this because 10 minutes after our dessert order the same waiter brings a single small Pazzokie to the table behind us and they say they didn't order it.  He acts surprised and says you must have gotten a free dessert.  They said thank you and he went on his way.   15, 20, 25 minutes go by, no dessert.  Then all of a sudden a third person comes to our table and says he was sent over to see if we needed anything else.  He acted like we had been sitting their too long and we were an annoyance to him.  Let me note the place was still only about half full.   To stop this review from becoming a book, the service was horrible.  Other than our actual waitress, every one was rather rude.  It took us over an hour and a half to have our meal in a place that was half empty and pumps out mainly pre made food. I would suggest NO ONE to go to this B.J.'s.  Go a few more miles to the one in Burbank.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=400

Kiki C.,"Glendale, CA",135,56,30,1.0,7/27/2015,"If I could give negative stars, I would. This is not just a review on less than subpar service, but also a case of prejudice.  The hostess, Karina, (if that's even her name), sat us down as soon as we entered and began to hand us our menus. I was shocked to see that she couldn't even pass me my menu because she was so absorbed in staring at my friend, a Muslim woman wearing her traditional hijab, nothing special. It was incredibly obvious, and Karina knew it. I was clearly sitting there waiting to receive my menu, watching her demeanor.  Our server, Corinth G (goes by Coco), came over about 5 minutes after being seated and asked for our drink orders.  10 minutes to receive waters.  Another 15 minutes and she takes our orders. We ordered two MINI pizookies.  About 20 minutes later, TWO servers (both young women, one a tall caucasian and the another a short Filipina) came out to bring two MINI pizookies. I have never seen TWO servers waste their time to carry out two small bread plates.  No nearby tables needed two servers to deliver dinner meals, something was clearly off.  This prejudice was so apparent, nobody else was getting treated the way we were. Seconds after we received our pizookies, Corinth placed the check on our table. SECONDS LATER. We didn't even begin to eat. As she was walking away with her back turned towards us, we hear a ""no rush"".  As we were leaving, I was asking the hostess what her name was and she chuckled. She clearly and connivingly chuckled, smiled, and said ""Karina"". I have never felt so disrespected by not just one, but FOUR workers.  Last time I will EVER be returning to this BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=220
Richard K.,"East Bay, CA",465,404,3716,2.0,1/15/2013,"I normally like BJ's such as the former Chicago Bulls player BJ Armstrong, the music of Bon Jovi and sometimes Billy Joel depending on my mood, and of course the real reason why all guys ""get up"" in the morning.  Sadly, unlike the ""awesome BJs"" mentioned above, I can't say that I like BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse because every time I go to their chain restaurants I get the same shitty service. It appears that BJ's has a universal policy for ""suckage"" and it's obvious that they must not share tips because none of the waiting staff look out for one another. I mean why is it ""so hard"" to get some damn water? I really wish they had those buttons that Korean restaurants have because having to flag someone down for water while ""choking"" on pizza is not fun.  Also, I don't like how Happy Hour (HH) at BJ's only applies to the bar area and not the regular booths and tables. ""Deep inside"" I wished that we had gone to Yardhouse instead because at least at Yardhouse, HH extends to the entire restaurant and they have a much better beer selection with a more professional staff that actually knows what the hell the beer they are serving tastes like. For example, when we were seated at our booth I asked our server what the guest tap Magic Hat tasted like since there was no flavor profile summary on the menu. This was met by ummm let me just get you a sample instead of any attempt at a description. When I did taste the sample, Magic Hat reminded me of nasty ass cough syrup. Thank god I settled for Bear Republic's Racer 5 IPA ($6-something).  Food-wise the wife and I ended up ordering the avocado eggroll thing and a medium-sized chicken bacon pizza. The avocado egg roll ($10- something) was ""way too thick"" because it consisted of a blend of avocados and cream cheese that was so heavy that it felt like it was getting stuck ""deep in the back of my throat"". The chicken bacon ranch pizza ($20- something) consisted of chicken with bacon, cheese, red onions, diced tomatoes, and ""globs of white stuff"" that I believed to be ranch that looked nothing like the picture on the menu. Taste-wise it was okay, but it was nothing ""orgasmic"". In fact, I think that for the price, the new handmade pan pizzas at Domino's taste lightyears better for a fraction of the cost. I hate restaurants where plates are not washed properly like the plates that were brought to our table, since finding other people's particles (OPP) of food on plates is disgusting. Also, it's exasperating when I need to look specifically for my server to get a glass of water because other servers are not in charge of our booth. And lastly, I especially get irked when it becomes an ordeal just to pay and get the fuck out.  In the end it's obvious that the BJ in BJ's must stand for Bad Job because their food and service quite frankly ""blows"". That could be why there is always someone training someone because of the high turnover. And I guess I'm not down with ""OPP""! Oh yea, and despite the 2-hour free validated parking, the parking structure has blind turns and it doesn't help that it's filled with speeding assholes.   -------------------- Pictures: Avocado Egg Roll Chicken Bacon Ranch Pizza -------------------- * There is a purpose to the words in ""quotations"" in my review, after all I am reviewing ""BJ's"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=220

Tiffany R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,1,1.0,6/8/2016,"Yesterday I had the worst BJ's experience and I just wanted to share. I ordered a caesar salad and the lettuce was wilted and dark and looked awful. Even the chicken had blood spots and fat coming off of the pieces. When the waiter came back I had moved all the gross-looking salad pieces to the top so he could see why I was unhappy with my salad. I then asked for a different salad instead. He made a fuss and seemed very annoyed. When he brought me my new salad, I noticed that they simply put other salad ingredients on top of my old salad rather than bringing me a new one. At this point though, I was very hungry and preferred not to make a fuss by speaking to the manager or getting further involved in the matter. It doesn't stop there, however. After our less-than-great meal, we ordered a pizooki to-go. After we got to our car and opened the pizooki box, I was extremely disappointed to see that our pizooki looked like someone had eaten half of it before giving it to us. It was very flat and did not even fill out the circular box. It was not even in the shape of a circle! It looked like someone ate it before us. I have attached a picture of the pizooki we received for reference. This picture was taken before we even started eating the cookie. I am very disappointed with the service we received, and also pretty surprised.

So he called his manager over and he proposed ""would you like a new dish or a free pizookie?"" Uh.. why would I want any other dish from that kitchen that put PUBIC hair in my food? Hell no, I don't want anything else from your kitchen. So after about 5 minutes of telling him NO, he finally just took the dish off my bill....  Disgusting. Never going back.

Chris K.,"Burbank, CA",0,5,,2.0,7/16/2014,"I ordered online today for my lunch break at work (7/16/2014). I ordered the enlightened turkey burger but wanted to change the side from mixed greens to a baked potato. Did it online without a problem. Set the time for pick up at 12:30. Seems simple enough... then I arrive at the place. I arrive at 12:30 as I indicated the pick up time would be. It took 10 minutes for anyone to even come help and there were servers everywhere, many of them not doing anything. Finally, when I was helped I told the person the order I had and they brought out the turkey burger with mixed greens. I told them I ordered it with a baked potato. The guy proceeded to tell me I didn't because it wasn't on the receipt or in the system when he looked it up. Funny because I still have the e-mail copy of the receipt and it clearly says baked potato. Oh and on top of the to-go container, it said ""side: potato."" When I continued to say I ordered it online and made the side a baked potato, he acted as though it was an inconvenience and told me he'd have to get his manager because it costs more. No where when I was ordering it online did it say it would cost extra to switch that. Poor service, poor online ordering system. Would not recommend this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=460

It is the day before 4th of July, so they should expect that the place can get packed. The receptionist was great. But the server Hector was not as friendly. It seems we felt rushed with ordering our food. I guess because he had a lot of tables to take care of.  It took ages for the food to arrive Food was inconsistent. We ordered the BJ Blue Ribbon BBQ - the ribs tasted good, but it was COLD!, the chicken was ok. We ordered the macaroni and cheese for my daughter, and i think it was undercooked, tasted bland too.

Tee N.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,10,4,1.0,1/22/2017,Came out on a Saturday night to have our belated Christmas dinner. It was 8 of us. I'm not going to go on and on about how horrible it was because in reality the company we were in mattered more than the disastrous dinner. I will just mention the highlights. Service was ok but things were forgotten and we had to wait. Food was brought without utensils. Upon arrival of the burgers my heart sank. I have NeVER seen a less appetizing burger in my life. No juice at all just dry and stale pieces of meAt. My friends burger looked like someone had taken a bite out of the meat so before the guy who brought it out left she asked if the burger was supposed to look like that. In shock he said no and took it back to the kitchen but by then the damage was done. She didn't want the burger anymore and cancelled it. My husband ordered his with cheese and it came with none. The appetizers we paid a WHOPPING $18 for were so ridiculous.  We all work in the food industry so we were just in shock at the shit you can put out there and call it food. The list goes on and on but I'm not a book writer. I just wanted to say my peace about it. The positives were the drinks and pizzokie. Like I said the company we were in made up for everything. And we genuinely enjoyed ourselves. We were just disappointed that we had to pay for such poor food and service. Next year we won't make the same mistake. Thank you for showing your true colors BJ's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=240

After eating we were left waiting over half an hour just to pay our damn bill, eventually walked to the front and asked the hostess, she walked it over to the server (I don't know why if he wasn't doing it in the first place) ten minutes later we finally had bill paid. 40 minutes to pay a damn bill. It took less time to eat the damn food. TERRIBLE service, we most definitely didn't tip and he's lucky we didn't just dine and dash since he ignored us the whole time and helped EVERY other table around us.

Zach Q.,"Los Angeles, CA",112,257,152,3.0,6/26/2014,"Being relatively new to CA, I had never been to a BJ's before. I heard good things about the beer selection so I had been meaning to check it out.  The place looked pretty nice and was well kept. The server started out by telling me he was gonna turn my good night into an excellent night. (Fail) I was surprised at first by the beer selection cause I had expected a lot of taps from different breweries. I just didn't realize their main focus was on their own beers, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  My wife ordered a flight of BJ's beers, I ordered a Sierra Nevada seasonal IPA bottle.  The flight that my wife received was well priced, but the servers messed up the order of which beer was which when they brought them out. They don't bring them out on a paddle, so there's no organization. They were out of the beer I ordered, and also the second beer I ordered, so I ended up getting a foreign beer, which I really enjoyed. They do have a good selection if Belgians in bottles. The BJ's beers were just ok, nothing to write home about. The food menu had some good options. We got a pizza which was really good but pricey for a 15 dollar small. We also got two apps which were cheap, and tasty.  When my server brought out my bill, they had charged me for both the beers they were out of, which just added to the frustration.  Overall it wasn't a bad visit, but I don't think there was anything that will keep me coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=240
Cydney M.,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA",82,670,3555,4.0,8/17/2012,"This BJ's Restaurant across the street from The Glendale Galleria is pretty good! O.K. so Drake, our server, gave me a hard time because I forgot his name and called him Dwayne.  My bad.  And the dishes look like they need to be thrown in the nearest recycling bin.  I still like it compared to their restaurant in Burbank which is dark and dreary or Rancho Cucamonga where you freeze to death before you get your food. FOOD: 4 stars.  Great lunch specials with flatbread pizzas and salads.  Everything has the calorie count.   This is a great place to bring kids because pizza is one of their major food groups, but then again pizza is my favorite too.  They have a Kids' Menu, Gluten-Free Menu, Curbside Take-out, handcrafted beer, cocktails and wine and many other items on the menu.  My son and I both had the following: Half Margherita Flatbread Pizza and Salad lunch special combo.  It wasn't the best pizza in the world, but I ate the whole thing so that's a good sign.   The salad was really good.  This was one of the lower calorie lunch special options. My son's friend had one of the individual deep dish pizzas and he really liked that.  My friend had the mahi-mahi tacos and she really liked those. There is a photo of the lunch menu next: Win win in my book.  Pizookie - Holy cow are those good!   I just had one bite of my son's.  Bottomless sodas and ice tea not too shabby.  Full bar, but none of us were partaking of mid-day.  Come on!  We're moms, not lushes. SERVICE: 3/5 stars.   The jury is out on Drake our server.  I needed him to replace our dirty looking plates and he was flirting with the hostess.  Dude, you can do that later!   AMBIANCE FACTOR: 3/5 stars.  It is a chain restaurant, but they have some interesting artwork on the walls.  Romantic: I will say a BIG NO.  Good for lunch with the co-workers or the family a BIG YES.  See my photo. PRICES ARE MODERATE: 3/5  stars.  Specials are pretty good at no more than $10.00.  The menu is huge and of course they have beer and other drinks.  Once again, it was lunch and our kids were with us.  Just say no and all that.  Set a good example for the next generation.  Next Monday when my son is on a Missle Cruiser, USS Wayne E. Meyer, in Santa Monica Bay headed toward Catalina all bets are off, but we'll be visiting an actual brewery instead. PARKING IN STRUCTURE: 3/5 Stars.  2 hours free with validation, but you will lose at least a half hour driving up to the roof when you arrive and back down when you leave.  Yes, you may see a couple spots, but they're only big enough for a motorcycle. LOCATION: 5/5 Stars.  Northwest corner of Broadway and Brand Blvd. in the middle of  Downtown Glendale, California, not to be confused with Glendale, Arizona.   It is across the street from  The Glendale Galleria, so for us shopaholics that is a really good thing.  In addition, Bloomingdales will be opening right across the street in a few months.  Yay!!!!  The Americana at Brand is just a couple blocks south on Brand Boulevard. In conclusion, this is a chain and while it is not unique it is still pretty good as far as food goes.   Definitely come here instead of eating in the stinky Food Park at the Galleria.   P.S.  A newer BJ's Restaurant will be opening in Old Town Pasadena in the next year in this really historic looking building.  I can just tell this new one is going to blow the rest out of the water.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=240

From the moment we sat down the bartender acted like he didn't want to be there and when we asked him questions about the food and drinks he wasn't helpful. I'm convinced our drinks had no alcohol in them. Im a lightweight and didn't feel a thing. The wings we ordered were the nastiest wings I ever had. Mind you everything we ordered was because he recommended it to us.  Now were annoyed and ready to go. Two women come to sit at the bar and his demeanor completely changes. He's being very helpful, smiling and laughing. Now it gets worse, a lady comes to tap us out because he completely ignored us for 10 minutes even though were right in front of him.

Nicole M.,"Glendale, CA",386,194,1266,1.0,4/17/2015,"So I went to BJ's last week and the week before and had issues with the staff during both visits.  Saturday- April 4th, 2015 around 7pm My waitress Elisa H. had the worst attitude for no apparent reason. The minute we took our seats she took a really nasty demeanor with us. When we sat down my friend was ready to order her salad, as an appetizer, and I wasn't ready to order, but I didn't care if her salad came out first, but to Elisa it was a big deal. I let her attitude slide thinking maybe I was making something out of nothing, but as our dinner proceeded I could no longer stand her attitude. I get that maybe she was having a bad day or maybe she was upset about having to work on a Saturday night, but there's no need to treat your customers poorly because of it. It's like she wanted us to leave the restaurant. My friend and I wanted dessert after dinner but she didn't even ask us and instead tossed the check on the table while we were still eating. Usually waiters ask if you want to see the dessert menu, good thing we both knew we wanted pizzokies so we let her know, but you could tell that she was annoyed because we weren't leaving. Isn't the staff supposed to want you to order more? That means you'll get a bigger tip!!  Sunday- April 12th around 12am So my friends and I came to get pizookies (yes, I love them), and we were glad that BJ's closes late. We ordered a trio and when we got our pizookies they were extremely undercooked. At first we thought it was because we had ordered one gluten free cookie, but nope all of our pizookies were grainy. It was like we were eating melted cookie dough (food poisoning alert!) We let our waitress Karla M. know about our issue and she didn't seem to like what we were telling her, so she went to get her manager. The manager (unfortunately, I didn't get his name) walks in and immediately takes an attitude with us saying that we're wrong and that pizookies are supposed to taste like that. We asked him if he wanted to take a bite but he declined as he is a diabetic. I repeatedly let him know that I'm a pizookie expert, and had just had one the week before, but he wasn't buying it. After going back and forth about our pizookie problem he reluctantly took them back and put in a new order for us. I really don't know why it was so hard for them to just take it back and bring us a new one without any rude questions or unnecessary remarks. It's like they thought we wanted a free pizookie or something. The thing cost around $9, and we only had one bite of each cookie, it's not like we had consumed the entire dessert! We called our waitress pretty quickly and addressed the problem, but they acted like we were thugs. I also don't know why we didn't get an apology. Aren't you supposed to make your customers happy, why make them feel like they're doing something wrong for speaking up.  I'm just really surprised by the nasty attitude that a majority of the staff has at this BJ's. I was even more shocked to see how rude and condescending the manager was. I guess the problem stems from management. I'm never stepping foot at this BJ's again. If it's not a problem with the staff, it's a problem with the food. Can't I just enjoy my pizookie in peace!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=240

Vanessa M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1210,766,2685,3.0,4/29/2014,"3 1/2 stars. I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants like Bj's, Cheesecake or those other ones. It's just my personal taste. Although the food is decent I'd never pick to go unless my friends insisted or I'm held hostage :) Paying for a salad that's over 1,000 calories or a sandwich that's more than 1,500 calories or so is not really ideal for me but hey that's just me. They are great though for happy hours and drinks. And of course...  drum rolls please... their PAZOOKIES! If you have not had this or know what it is you are missing out on life. A giant warm baked cookie with 2 scoops of ice cream. It's every fat person in ourselves dream along with the smokers with their munchies or anyone who loves dessert!! I recommend half chocolate chip and oreo or peanut butter! And you get a free one if it's your birthday (although I believe it's a smaller size). _Chicken  Lettuce Wraps. This was good and somewhat on the healthier side. But nothing special. I just got this because it was one of the lightest on their menu and my friend said it was good so I tried it out. Pretty tasty and refreshing a nice appetizer to share. _Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms. This was pretty good. Comes in 6 bite sized mushrooms, filled with spinach, feta cheese, chopped mushrooms, herb bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese, then sprinkled with crispy bread crumbs and drizzled with lemon pesto sauce. The mushroom was moist and warm, a great appetizer to share! _California Club Flatbread. This was great! The flat bread was thin crusted, which I love. Grilled chicken, crisp Applewood smoked bacon, tomatoes and mozzarella cheese. Drizzled with roasted garlic aioli and topped with fresh diced avocado. Very light and not too cheesy or heavy. A little on the salty side. Great to share as well or have as your main dish.  _Barbecued Bison Burger. Lean, ground buffalo, topped with chipotle BBQ sauce, a seared green chili and pico de gallo and served on a toasted bun with Baja sauce, red onions and lettuce. Served with tangy slaw tossed with Baja vinaigrette and topped with green onions. This was just okay. Although Bison drew my attention the food was quite an opposite reaction. Was not a big fan of the bison patty seasoning. It was a bit bland. The slaw was boring and had barely any dressing.  Overall the food is decent and they offer a huge selection of pizzas, sandwiches, appetizers etc to fit anyone's need.

Nora C.,"Pasadena, CA",0,3,1,2.0,7/20/2015,"I usually don't write reviews, but unfortunately after yesterday's disappointment, I am writing a bad review about one of my favorite restaurants.  At the beginning we had to wait, not because they were busy, but because our buzzer was not working. Then we placed an order (only 1 pasta and 1 french fries) and it took an exact half an hour for them to bring only the fries. After waiting another 10 minutes they brought the wrong pasta. So we had to wait another 15 minutes to get the correct one. Luckily the waitress was nice and she apologized for taking too long, saying that they have a big order and they were working on it. I understand the wait because they had an unusual situation, but that wasn't the only problem. The thin fries, which I usually order and love, looked and tasted really bad as if they fried it twice using rancid oil. When I told the waitress, she looked at it and said ""that looks nasty"". It really did. So they replaced it. Also the dishes were dirty (see picture). Plus we already ordered a piazookie (which we are addicted to), but by the time we had the correct pasta and the normal fries we realized that we were there for more than 2 hours so we had to cancel the piazookie order. When we got the bill they didn't charge for the piazookie but then they brought one anyway. I asked them to take it back since I'm not charged for that. What a disorder. As if all this wasn't enough, at the end we ended up paying for the parking, even after validation, because we parked there for more than 2.5 hours. Such a disappointing experience.

It ended up being 10 and from then on our waitress seemed as if she were done with us. I understand that figuring out how many checks, who is ordering appetizers and who isn't, etc., can be frustrating for the waitstaff, but our service proceeded to be horrible. It took about 50 minutes to get our drinks and appetizers, two or three of our orders were incorrect, we had to ask for refills, sugar, plates, enough pizza stands, and we saw and heard our waitress complaining to other waitstaff about us. The manager came over and addressed a burger that had been sent back as incorrect by sending out a new burger, but he left our waitress on service at our table which made a very awkward atmosphere.

May P.,"Los Angeles, CA",102,226,2,1.0,1/9/2012,"After careful review of their allergen menu, I decided to get a cheeseless mini vegetarian pizza, as the dough is vegan, and a salad. The salad was great, but the pizza was the most pathetic piece of crap I've ever seen. They're not kidding about it being mini. And you would think that with a cheeseless pizza, they'd naturally put more marinara sauce on it or olive oil to retain the moisture. That's pretty intuitive, right? Nope. They basically just baked some bread, put some tomato sauce in the center and tossed in about a quarter of a handful of olives, bell peppers and onions on top. I'm not joking. They were so stingy with the toppings that I had to complain to our server that this was the most pathetic piece of crap I'd ever seen. $10 for a piece of crusty bread with some crap on it. C'mon man, I got nothing else on this pizza, and you're gonna give me this stupid excuse for a meal? I'm never going back here. It wasn't even comped. They offered to have them do it again, but honestly, by the time it came back out, my friends would have already finished the meal and would be stuck waiting for me to finish. Bull$hit.

This is like my second or third time coming here and something funky always happens. Last visit my poor brother had to wait like an hour for his burger because they made a mistake the first time.  This most recent visit was just as iffy as the last. My mom and I took a seat around 3pm on a Saturday. It took about 20 minutes for a waitress to decide to take our drink order, by that time we already looked over the menu and placed our order at the same. We started off with a tomato and mozzarella cheese balls salad type thing ($2.97) that wasn't too bad. Then, came the chicken wantons and to my lovely surprise there was a strand of HAIR in it, the manager deducted that from our bill but still really!! A PIECE OF HAIR WAS IN MY FOOD!!!!

Karla G.,"Los Angeles, CA",562,261,361,2.0,2/3/2012,"I am a huge fan of BJ's. I love their salads, pizza and beer. The BJ's we frequent the most is the one in Woodland Hills. Anyhow, I chose to have a dinner party at this particular location this week because it was closer for the people in my party. We got there and the hosts were very pleasant. We went in, sat down, and waited... and waited... and waited some more... By the time I was done reading the menu for the 100th time, I decided to get up and ask someone to please send our server over because we were starving. The host tried to chase the server down and was ignored. The server finally came over, took our order and... we waited.... and waited... and waited some more for our drinks & appetizers. Oh boy. ""This isn't going to end well"", I thought, so I calmly walked over to the hosts and asked to speak to the manager. Kate (the mgr) came over, was extremely apologetic and immediately took action. She took our orders, checked on our appetizers and drinks and slowly but surely things started to turn around. I explained to Kate that this was not a good time for our server to provide crappy service because I had guests there and it was a very important occasion, so I wanted everything to go smoothly. She totally understood and REALLY made our experience great from that point forward. She took the wrong appetizer back & brought us the right one, got us our drinks, got us chips & salsa and even gave us a couple of extra pizookies for the kids to make up for the frustrating first half of our dinner. She went above and beyond any manager I've ever dealt with at any restaurant and for that, I am extremely grateful. Thank you BJ's for having an exceptional employee like Kate, she REALLY, REALLY, REALLY turned a potentially awful situation into a positive one!  Kate also gave me a $25 gift card to compensate for all that went wrong, so I will definitely give this BJ's another shot and hopefully give them a better review as well. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=500

I was very disappointed. The mahi mahi was a bit fine a lil unflavored but it was passable. Below that contained more of red peppers, onions, I think its cabbage,  as for peas - it said it had snow peas which I didn't see any, few pineapple and like a dash of rice. I posted up a picture but I forgot to take it before I ate it lol but anyway thats how my food was. I also drop the rate of it being a 4 because it wasn't so flavorful. As for appetizers - no calamari this time so we got spinach & artichoke dip and boneless wings. The boneless wings were good I guess because it had bbq sauce but tasted something you would like at a fast food joint. I love the spinach and artichoke but they don't give enough spinach and artichoke to consume that many tortilla chips.  Our waitress was great though, she was very friendly and patient with us which I give (5 stars).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=520
Melissa D.,"San Diego, CA",5,85,2,2.0,10/27/2011,"I've never understood some people's obsession with BJs. I always thought it was overrated and overpriced. However, this location on Brand is pretty bad. In general, all restaurants on Brand get pretty busy at night and on the weekends. However, this place is extra bad. The service is here is emabarassingly slow. Everytime I've been here, the server disappears for about half an hour and then suddenly else some other server shows up as if they've always been taking care of you. Let's just say, I've had to wait nearly 20 minutes and ask 3 times just to get a glass of water. And once your food arrives, you better make sure you have everything you need because you won't see that server again for quite awhile. In fact, he/she just seems to disappear. You can't flag her down because she's no where to be found.  If you've never been to a BJs, definitely avoid this one, or at least bring a good book and a jacket (the A/C is always on full blast). If you're still interested in trying it, go to another location but don't expect much from their food; it's just okay.

I ordered the broccoli cheddar soup, and it was more of a thick dip, than a soup.  The cocktails I ordered were way too sweet and syrupy, ugh!

Stevie K.,"San Bruno, CA",148,50,65,4.0,1/11/2012,"Glendale.  Saturday Night.  I'm in town for a seminar and all I can think about is where am I'm going for beer, food and place to watch the playoff games. BJ's naturally (especially since it's walking distance from the hotel).  Well I'm no stranger to BJ's so I knew what to expect. Delicious beer, decent food and a good atmosphere with good service. I've got to say that the place was fairly busy but I was able to snag a tall table next to the bar with my friends. Since I'm still sticking to my new year's resolutions I scan the menu for some healthy options and what do you know, they have a section just for this. It's called Lighter Fare or something like that. Well I'm debating between the Tilapia with rice and a chicken something or other. I ask the waitress which is better and of course she tells me both are great. I go with fish and a Lightswitch Lager which also happens to be low calorie, for beer at least.  Food comes out and it looked, smelled and tasted delicious. I pretty much wolfed the whole thing down in fifteen minutes while chasing it with two of those light switches. The only complaint about the food was with the rice pilaf. There were a couple of hard balls of rice, kinda like when you leave the rice cooker on and a ball forms at the bottom, but's that my only complaint. The fish tasted good, was tender and flakey and didn't stink.  All in all it goes like this:  Food- 3.5 stars Beer- 4.5 stars Service- 4.5 stars Atmosphere- 4.0 stars",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=520

Jen L.,"Oakland, CA",132,192,59,3.0,4/2/2012,"5 stars for excellent service! I know BJ's is a chain restaurant, and most chains don't have fantastic service just because they are a chain and will constantly have customers no matter what. But our entire table was thrilled by our server's (I wish I could remember her name) pleasant attitude on a BUSY Clippers' game Saturday night. Our large party (15+) had just come from our friends' wedding at the Methodist church a couple blocks away, and on a Saturday night, we were pretty sure everywhere would be packed and wouldn't let us in. However, to our pleasant, pleasant surprise, BJ's said they could accommodate some of us outside and some of us at the bar, which worked out perfectly since some were going to get drinks and others weren't. BTW, the entire lobby area was full of people waiting for a table, but they didn't want to sit outside. Even on a rainy night, the heat lamps offered plenty of heat, so sit outside to skip the wait! Inside at the bar, seating is open, so we were able to snag good tables and booths. Like I said earlier, our server was so fun - she gave us recommendations on apps and beers and had fun with us when we ordered our round of shots. The atmosphere was lively and fun in the bar area and lent to an excellent end to a Saturday full of memories! My big gripe (which is why I minused two stars) is that the drinks were unbelievably weaksauce; we even had to ask if there was any alcohol put into the drink. The mojito tasted like sugar water, the gin and tonic like water, and the cranberry vodkas like watered down cranberry juice. Sad since we're paying so much for the ALCOHOL, not the ice.

The staff themselves were also OK - everybody was very polite.  However, this place has a serious problem with organization: 1) True wait times were 2-3 times longer than projected for seating, food, etc. 2) After waiting 20-30 minutes to get a seat, I noticed that there were still a large number of unoccupied table.  This implied to me that they were severely understaffed, and this was why they were not utilizing all of their seating at ~7 PM on a Friday 3) I probably had to wait about 10 minutes to get a beer after ordering it.  I was told this was because it was so busy, but I don't see why it should take that long to pour a drink. 4) Our pizza was delivered to the wrong table, so we had to wait for another one to be made from scratch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=520

I ordered this with  a side of strawberry sauce (the stuff they use for the beignets). Obviously, this is ooey gooey deliciousness. But, oh, wait! I didn't receive that exact order! UGH. THE SERVICE: 1 star; What started out as great and friendly service, turned into a total bitch move on our server's part. When the Pizookie arrived, it had the side of strawberries, but no strawberry syrup. We asked for it again 3 times. So,  as the ice cream is melting, we waited and waited for the sauce. It never came, so I decided to just eat the damn melted pizookie. THEN...I am like, ""WTF, this is chocolate chip. Or is it? Maybe the C&C just looks exactly like the chocolate chip one.""  I never, ever eat chocolate chip anything bc it's elfin boring, so I know I didn't order that shit. When we alerted our server, he said, ""Yes, that's the chocolate chunk that you ordered, I have it written down right here."" I had to get a little stern, bc don't tell me that I ordered my last choice of something. I wouldn't have even ordered it! I told him, ""Yes, that's what you wrote down, but thats not what I ordered. Trust me, I would never order that, nor has the word 'chunk' left my lips in years."" He copped a 'tude...it went on for like 2 minutes (ridiculous),...we asked if we could get the one we wanted. The correct one took forever, had no strawberries or sauce, but it was still MFing good. When the bill came, both pizookies were on the bill. And, no we didn't eat even a third of the wrong order. Basically, I won't go on further, because this is so stupid, but he had to get the manager to comp it off of our check, it was ridiculous.  OVERALL: Seriously, eff this place.

It hurt not ordering my usual deep dish, but the ""Chicken A La Fresca"" was surprisingly tasty, fresh and flavorful. Memorably good! One of those rare instances a restaurant chain offers a healthy option that's a homerun. The great service and upscale atmosphere you enjoy at BJ's are always a plus.

There were plenty of choices in beer and you'll be able to find something that fits your taste no matter what it is.  I felt it was bold of server to tell me her favorites, because beer is a personal thing.  A young lady from Southern California and a guy from the Pacific Northwest are poured from different beer bottles. The menu has lots of choices - mostly burgers and pizza, but I chose the Balsamic Glazed Chicken.  Its probably best thing for you on the menu, served with mashed potatoes and spring greens.

Ordered a feta cheese and watermelon salad, which blew me away. The negative part of this review and the whole reason I came was the pizza. The problem was there was too much bread and absolutely no sauce, which is the exact opposite of the perfect deep dish pizza in my opinion.

In the time the glass was on the floor someone could have gotten hurt badly.

Sad to say, I cannot remember the name of my server- however to describe her, she was about 5'3' - tanned- long dark hair- most likely of Latin decent- middle aged- very thin. I was there on  a Saturday evening about 8PM. To begin with, we never had to flag her down for any requests. She made sure to check-in with us frequently without ever disturbing us. As part of the Dinner For Two deal, we ordered the Tomato Bisque Soup, which we were happily able to enjoy with side Garlic Bread on the house! (Never have I been given that when ordering this soup.) Did you also know that you can incorporate 2 of your favorite Pazookie choices into 1!? Yes, you can request it to be 1/2 and 1/2. Something our server offered us which enabled us to try two of the Pazookies we were keenly eyeing. I recommend ordering 1/2 Chocolate and 1/2 White Chocolate-  No doubt, it will hit the spot!

(so about 90 minutes into the night.)  another friend got a soup and salad.  the soup was the first thing to come out after the drinks.  and the salad came out 40 minutes later. (about 15 minutes before the poke.) all in all, the food is uneven, ranging from friggin delicious (thick cut fries), to practically unedible (calamari, pizza, ETC.)  the cocktails are kinda gross.  seriously.  we sent back the mango mojitos (bc we never ordered them), and the mojitos we got in exchange were seriously disgusting.  i'd normally send back drinks that tasted that shitty - but if they got two shots at getting it right, figured the third shot would just be futile and a waste of time.  (the other cocktails, they tasted like juice.)   the beer is pretty much fantastic across the board.  the service is... well, they're really nice.  but they got half the orders wrong half the time - AND THEY TOOK FOREVER.  (you know... real sweet, but kinda incompetent.) i was hoping this could be a new hang out place since it's so close to where i live - and i seriously used to go to the Burbank location like 3 times a week for happy hour.  but after these two visits, too many people left unhappy and unsatisfied.  i give this place 2 stars since the service was nice and some of the food was good.  otherwise, THIS PLACE IS CRAP",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=540

The food here is no different from other BJ's we've eaten at.  Service is what really makes/breaks this place.  We've had fantastic service and we've had service that we swore would make us never return (although we did). Make sure you get your parking validated.  This is not one of the public Glendale places with free 90-min parking.  They do have cheaper options now (Barbacoa tacos = love!) and their bar has never been too shabby with how they make their cocktails.

The waitress was really nice, and fun to talk to.  We talked about things we gave up for Lent, and even talked about the glucose-free pizza they offered on the menu.  She was funny, and very friendly.  I would not mind asking her to be my server again (if only i could remember her name!).  Anyway, the food took a while to get to us, but when it did, it was very yummy.  I got the glucose free cheese pizza with extra toppings of black olives and mushrooms.

We also tried their bruschetta on focaccia, which I also liked a lot! But the ""liked a lot"" and ""amazing"" doesn't stop with the appetizers.  Their calzone and angel-hair pasta were just so perfect too! It was one of those days you wish you had a bigger stomach so you can put more food into it and let your tongue and other senses enjoy the meal a little longer!

As with any BJ's Restaurant the food is mediocre but the pizzas are especially disgusting, namely the new portobello one with a balsamic glaze. Seriously? I didn't think anyplace could screw up portobello and balsamic. Their pizza dough is greasy, doughy, too chewy.  The pizookie choices are their saving grace although its best just to stick with the classic chocolate chip pizookie or the white chocolate macadamia. All the others are too sickly sweet. If you check in, you can get a deal for a party of two: $19.95 for a medium pizza and pizookie. It's great because at only $10/person, it's more than enough for what you should pay for food here.

Vineet S.,"San Francisco, CA",583,21,,5.0,5/1/2012,"I've been thinking of reasons to not like BJ's of Glendale. I haven't any. So I read some other 1-star reviews, just to see what my fellow humans had to say. 1. Some 17 year old: ""I decided to get a cheeseless mini vegetarian pizza"". Why would you go to a comfort food/beer garden and order an amputated pizza? With a vegan crust? Why don't you just swallow the Sierra Club's website? No carbs there. Go hug a Yeti.  2. Half naked wannabe in front of an $8000 corvette (Kelly Blue Book Value): ""Go down the street to OUTBACK STEAKHOUSE..half the price..great service and almost half the price"".  Also, is it ""half the price"" or ""almost half the price""? I suppose being naked in front of a 4-figure car complicates decision making.  Seriously, I can imagine a conversation with this specimen to go like: ""Oh my GAWDI just HATE Seattle!"" ""You're in San Francisco"" ""Whatever... Same longitude"" ""That's.. Surprisingly accurate! Do you even know what a longitude is?"" ""Duh... It's the opposite of shortitude."" These two aside, it would seem that most complaints come from not-so-stellar service found on Friday and Saturday nights. Because everyone comes here. All the time.  However, I frequent this establishment every 8-10 weeks, and I've ALWAYS had a great time. Every time. We've had two birthdays here of parties of 12 and 6; been here during happy hour and regular hours; sampled nearly half the menu in some form of the other; service has been great but not stellar; and we never had trouble with parking. I won't get into details about the menu - just don't order random weird stuff. Their pizzas and appetizers won't disappoint.  Entrees are fine, too. Desserts are worth saving some real estate in the tummy for.  I'm not a beer aficionado, but my bros order for me and their draughts are always crisp and aptly chilled. I haven't any complaints.  I've never tried their soup and salad special here, come to think of it. But that's probably because I have better things to digest .

The gluten-free pizza is one of the best in the city for my celiac daughter.  The wait staff also volunteered that a side dish wasn't recommended and offered an alternative without prompting.

I can't blame the waiters, but I can only blame the restaurant.  BJ's is one of those restaurants.  This one waitress kept asking us every 2 minutes if we were ready to order, obviously to get a large tip in the end. By the 5th time, I asked her if she could give us a little extra time. I must of offended her somehow because she completely ignored me the whole day and charged my card TWICE.  The bank would have taken me behind the building to violate me if my balance went negative, lucky me, I kept a little extra.

I hadn't been to a BJ's for a very long time, and the first time at this location.  I liked it!  It was buzzing on a Friday night at 9pm and quite loud.  They offer validation for up to 2 hours of free parking in the structure (located just behind the restaurant, and shared with CPK and Islands).  They sat our party of 2 right away, yay, because I was starvin' Marvin.

There was very little of the other ingredients, it was practically a giant ball of lettuce that looked like it was glued together. The chicken in the salad was bland and had no taste. My friend got the BJ's Brewhouse burger and she's lactose intolerant so she asked our waiter if there's any cheese in the burger and our waiter said no. Her burger comes and she eats half of it before she realizes something tastes off. We took her burger apart and saw that there was shredded melted cheese melted onto both of the buns. We specifically asked if there was any cheese in the burger and our waiter said no, it wasn't written on the menu either that there was shredded melted cheese on the bun. We tell our waiter that her burger had cheese in it and he said there isn't supposed to be any cheese in there. He was apologetic and offered to bring her a new burger but by then we were all done with our food and weren't going to wait another 20 minutes for them to remake her burger.

My 1-start rating is for this *specific* (Glendale) location because they have the absolute *worst* service! I kid-you-not. On multiple occasions, my party and I have had to ask for utensils numerous times before getting them. If you sit at the outside patio area and need their torches lit, good luck with that! The employees are also very disgruntled and seem to not like one another, which explains the poor service. I avoid this location even though it is almost walking distance from my place and I go to an alternate BJ's location where the staff is much happier with their work environment and so are much more pleasant when they are serving you.

Several new booths, new dividers, and overall, the look of the restaurant just feels a lot more clean and put together these days. I came here for late-night Happy Hour, and while I'm still a tad sad about the newish ""4-5-6"" Happy Hour Menu (namely that the Mini Deep Dish Pizzas are no longer 50% off but instead $6, eliminating the steal of the century $3.50 Cheese Pizza option) my friend and I ordered Wings and Angus Beef Sliders with thin cut seasoned fries to a resounding bill of *drumroll* ... $9.81! Pretty great. I would definitely recommend coming here when Joe and/or Kat are working at the bar. We came to sit about 20 minutes early, expecting to have to just kill time until Happy Hour with a small bite or something, but Joe let us order early!

Hailey Z.,"Glendale, CA",301,626,508,2.0,3/25/2012,"I got a nasty ""compliment"" from someone that I know is friends with the waitress that I am referring to in my review below. I have taken this waitresses name off my review just to appease her, but I think it's lame that someone that I'm sure works at this BJs that knows this waitress to write someone regarding my review. Regardless if someone is a single mom or had a bad day, you need to leave your drama at home and work your hardest to get through it. Yelp is a public forum for people to write about their good and bad experiences. If I have to mention an employees name to steer consumers away from that person so they can have a better experience than I did, then I will do that. Here is my redone review: Would have given this place more stars had we had a better waitress. To all who dine here, stay away from _______(name withheld because someone was upset that a name was mentioned). She is the worst waitress alive, would disappear, lacked major communication skills and just flat out had the stink eye the entire time and her attitude sucked. Never saw one smile come to her face, she never wrote anything down and anytime we'd ask for something she wouldn't even acknowledge us. Asking for refills was the worst, we'd ask and she wouldn't even acknowledge that we asked, she'd just come back 10 minutes later and would just fill up our glasses, without even smiling, no your welcome, nothing.  I'm not a fan of the Burbank location and now I'm really not a fan of this place. The parking here sucks just as bad as Burbank too. Free 90 minutes. At the rate our waitress was going, we were just 15 minutes over 90 minutes. For some reason we owed $5.50 in parking for those extra 15 minutes. I'm done coming to this area in Glendale. ****I would also like to add that this review was not powered by the fact that I didn't get a smile with my refill like the angry complimenter had stated, it was because she was a rude person that day that didn't take the time to see if we needed anything else after she dumped the food on our table. Everything she did was done with attitude.

Keely G.,"Los Angeles, CA",797,262,55,2.0,6/14/2012,"Been here a few times (it's close to the office) and it's been pretty good -- decent lunch specials, etc., however I'm going to have a helluva time convincing my co-workers to ever step foot in there again after yesterday. So, we walk in and it's not busy at all (except for the bar where a soccer game is on). Our waiter comes right over and asks if we are ready to order our drinks and food. Whoa buddy, although I appreciate the enthusiasm, we literally just sat down, can you give us a minute to view the menu? Here's where it all went downhill. FRY-GATE. We ordered our entrees, along with a side of thin fries. Impossible to screw that up right? Wrong. Their first attempt came out cold and NOTE TO BJ's: shoestring fries should be somewhat crispy, not like soggy actual shoe stings. Next attempt: Still not hot and still soggy as hell. So fed up, we ask to try the thick fries. Next attempt: As I type this I'm still waiting, because they never came. Our food arrives... Mine was the chicken quesadilla which was ok -- stingy on the chicken and cheese and was not really filling at all. We tell our waiter that the fries never came and he goes to check on them... Instead of coming back with the fries, he asks us if the manager came by... All 3 of us say in disgusted unison: ""No"". Off he goes to get the manager.... The manager never comes... Instead our waiter asks if we'd like a pizookie. Since we are still eating and since we are pissed and waiting on a manager who would never come, we assumed that the manager didn't want to deal with the situation, so he authorized this peace offering, which we accepted. Lo and behold when the bill comes, we are charged for the pizookie!! Wtf! We see the manager across the room and try to wave him down. He ignores us. Meanwhile, we just want our check so we can get the hell out of there, but now our waiter is M.I.A... Naturally! After about 10 minutes we see him with his only other table and flag him down...10 more minutes for him to charge the cards and bring them back.  We left hungry, feeling ripped off, annoyed and were late for our meeting. No bueno BJ's. P.S.

The beers on tap were also a great complement to our food.  Our server was really nice to. Anyone who cards me deserves a gold star!  But the downside, and major downer it was, were the desserts. The monkey bread was good, but tasted something similar i made with Pillsbury crescent rolls! The beignets are New Orleans, French style donuts. Deep fried, tasty goodness.. usually. These were not even donuts, but a sourdough dinner roll dipped in sugar!! I was appalled! How can they call it something it's not! It's wasn't even a donut!

Stephy S.,"San Francisco, CA",5000,2603,1054,3.0,3/22/2010,"Being who I am and having been where I've been, when a friend informed me that her Bday Bar Crawl was happening on Brand Blvd in Glendale and starting at the very corporate chain restaurant/bar called BJ's, well, my first thought was ""ugh."" I ain't gonna lie.  However, since I missed her dearly and hadn't seen her in many many moons, I pushed that ugh under the rug and decided I was going to go where ever we were going so I could see her.  Well that, and I was told Damon's was a stop on the crawl and that is one of my fave places around, sooo, hehe, that helped. And so I scuddled on down to Glendale, parked in the mighty structure and made my way into corporate happy hour. I ordered a Greyhound and when it arrived and I was told it was only $4.50 for a gigantic glass of it, well, my tune changed. This may not be so bad after all. As I caught up with friends at the bar and eyeballed the food it looked like what I would expect from a chain called BJ's. Most of it was colorful and had zig zaggy sauce stripes across the plates of nachos or bruschetta. There was the resident cheese dip of some sort that almost tempted me, but knowing there was a Damon's cheeseburger in my future, I stood strong. The crowd seemed to be a nice bunch of after work folks. Some dressed in ties, some perhaps coworkers sneaking off for a date/drink after work and definitely a few first dates. I love people watching and am pretty good at it and definitely heard a few, ""soo, what kind of movies do you like!"" Aha, first date 101. There was also a nice pair of gentlemen sitting at a table with a number of free seats who kindly offered them up to us girls standing around the bar. And here I read that chivalry was dead! Very cool indeed. Overall, BJ's is what it is. It's a chain and if you don't mind chains, then this will suit ya just fine. I however still and will most likely always prefer the mom and pops, but hey, that's just me.

Fred C.,"Los Angeles, CA",48,24,5,2.0,8/6/2010,"BJ's is your standard American food.  Nothing fancy and nothing spectacular.  Nice beer menu though.  Overall, a decent three star place to eat. What throws it down to two though is the craptacular service.  I'm talking about the Glendale one though, this may not apply to the Burbank one.  I haven't eaten there in a while.  Anyways, I went here to eat with my girlfriend (this was a while ago).  Once the waitress served us our food, we proceeded to get ignored while: (pick one) A.  waiting for refills B.  waiting to get our check  C.  waiting to pay for our check D.  waiting for our ordered desserts E.  WTF all of the above This didn't need to be a list... We asked for a manager and got the kitchen chef.  We were supposed to get a refund for dessert for the time we spent waiting but no, they messed that up to and again, we had to wait while they fixed it.  ZOMG.  This is getting ridiculous.  The manager eventually comes out of his hiding place to talk to us and tries to put on a jester act.  Lol, it was laughable.  Pathetic attempt at customer service, and no one wanted to speak up for it.  Except for the kitchen chef guy.  Hats off to you, sir.  You have my respect. We haven't gone back since.  I don't know if the manager is still there or what but the experience has killed any thought of going back.  If you're thinking of going here, just keep in mind that it'll be hit or miss. It's not going to get one star because the food is decent.  Hopefully no one else gets treated like we did.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=600

You can start with the tomato basil soup and house salad (my favorite order) and then, after you finish, bam! switch it up and get the broccoli cream and Caesar salad, then bam! skip the salad entirely and just get chili. I don't know any other restaurant that allows such switchery, but it is something that should be done by every restaurant, cost efficiency be damned. Then there's the fact that service is consistently fast, and that, this being the middle of Glendale, people watching is pretty primo.

Javier J.,"Los Angeles, CA",1656,1996,248,2.0,2/8/2010,"As someone who has experienced a great number of BJ experiences, and enjoyed many of them without much complaints. I mean, who's going to complain about a BJ's experience? You can't complain about eating out... But when it came to this BJ experience, I have to say.. this one sort of sucked.  If you've read that paragraph in any way other than it was intended.. well then, you have a dirty mind my friend. And that's more than likely why I will call you friend. Besides, you can't blame me for making those easy jokes. The pizza place named BJ's will get mocked by me like the Costco like whole salers store chain in the South called BJ's Whole Sale which also sales BJ's Gas. Believe me, that's gas you'd want when you're getting serviced to fill you up with BJ's....  On to the review. First off, for as many times as I have been on Brand, I haven't ever really bothered coming tot his BJ's. I saw no need with a better one that felt more at home in Burbank. Not to mention that with Porto's just a stones throw away, I'd rather have myself some Porto's sandwich. So when I decided to come to this one it was a brand new BJ's experience...(I'm really not this immature.. I swear) There's something I love about BJ's (I'm not even going to try.. that one says it all itself) I love the beer. Their beer is really good and there's a variety of flavors that one can try.. So when I saw an ad for the 10th Anniversary ale, I just had to try it. So when I sat down It was the first thing I ordered. The waiter, in a rare BJ's situation let me completely down. Told me  ""Oh, sorry, we just ran out of that yesterday""  and to and insult to injury followed it up with  ""Oh it was really good.""  Dick move.. Dick move. Rub it in more how I'm not going to chug some delicious fluid down in this BJ outing.  Got to ordering pizza and the waiting game began. Now I know full well how long it normally will take for a Pizza order to get put out.. and I'm a pretty patient person, but it did feel like the pizzas took their sweet time to get out there. So when that happened we decided to order the pizookie at that point so that we can make sure we're not waiting too long after the pizza is done to get it... bad move. You could even say it was a bit of a... Boner (Ooooooooh!)  Most places would wait a while to put the order in, they were really quick to the punch and the pizookie came out while we were still working through the pizza. What the hell, timing should be a major sticking point. A good server doesn't bring out desert so quickly. It's sort of premature at that point. And really, the last thing you want is all your stuff to come out quickly..   Pizookie was good, but how could they not be considering what it's made out of. It was the happy ending to an otherwise lack luster BJ's experience.  The management would like to apologize for any crude language and lame puns in this review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=600

I am not picky at all when it comes to my food, if I am going to BJs, I expect chain restaurant qulity food (meaning adequate, but mass produced - basically edible). Unfortunately this restaurant has not been this quality for a while. I gave them three strikes before I crossed them off of my list of lunch/dinner spots to hit in the area.  The first strike was lunch one day: we were seated immediately (plus!) but then we were not visited by a wait staff for over 20 minutes. you might be thinking, hey, they were probably busy - well no, that's not the case. There were 6 tables full. We couldnt even get a wait staff to make eye contact. they have all mastered the look off into the distance without being available... Strike two: On another trip, that part of the visit went fine, we were seated and helped immediately, but our food took over 40 minutes to get to us. And by the time it finally made it to us, it was wrong. there were 6 of us and they got 2 orders mixed up, 2 orders were completely wrong and they forgot my boss' order completely - as in, they forgot to make it/place it for those 40 minutes. Strike three: Again, I am not a picky eater. However, the food I ordered was so bland and tasteless and wilted/sad looking that I barely picked at it. It was so unmemorable I cannot even remember what it was I ordered to report it here.  Like I said, other BJs are great - I love their beer and their ""buffalo style"" pizza is to die for!

Brito M.,"Los Angeles, CA",188,60,26,2.0,8/26/2011,"ehhh don't waste your time. I went to BJs for my first time with some coworkers, and I wouldn't really recommend this place for any event... really.   Firstly, I seriously dislike menu overload. With every cuisine option imaginable, BJ's has no focused speciality resulting in mediocre food. Too much quantity equals low quality. To help me select one of BJ's best items, I asked my waitress what is good, and she replied, ""I eat everything."" (Although it seems impossible with their 2000 items, she really did look like she ate everything).  She also appeared slightly disturbed that I wasn't completely ready to order, and that I was taking her time away from something else. I'm sorry maym, the reason you're employed over a computer is so you can adequately attend to patrons, so LIE TO ME and tell me any item on the menu! She might have had too many tables than she could handle. Throughout the dinner she rarely visited our table, and was very short when she was present.  Anyways, I decide to order the avocado roll for appetizer, caesar salad, bacon cheeseburger(highlighted on the menu) with shoe string fries, and the pizookie. Avocado Roll - surprisingly good, but not restaurant quality (I do believe I could have preheated that from a box, and it would have tasted the same) Casear Salad - Average Burger - Average Fries - Sad. Very Sad. They were just not vivacious or anything to enjoy. Plate fillers really.  Pizookie - REALLY delicious! We ordered a half peanut butter, half chocolate chip combination, and it was GONE in 3 seconds. This is remarkably similar to UNO's deep dish cookie.  The food was just too bland, and the food coming out of the kitchen was slow and sporadic! The appetizer took forever, and then our salads all arrived to the table individually. (This isn't that big of a deal, but why couldn't you just wait until the salads were prepared?) After finishing the food we had, we waited patiently for the main course. We were then told by the manager that one of the dishes was taken out and given to another table, so we were to wait longer for our entree. Fine. Things happen, but what REALLY turned me away was the 12 minute dessert! By this time, my stomach enzymes are telling me I'm full ! I strategically eat everything possible before I'll feel that I'm full so I can eat more! This was RUINED.

I guess I shouldn't have expected too much from a brewery in terms of great food.  I ordered the veggie burger on wheat bread and wedge cut fries. I was surprised to see that the bread was buttered and grilled which I wasn't expecting and the wedge cut fries were breaded and then fried. The flavors were ok but just not very healthy at all. The rest of my party seemed to enjoy their food.  The server was very friendly and nice but the actual quality of the service was lacking. We had to ask for ketchup and mustard 3 different times and they were very slow in clearing our plates from the appetizers. They brought my brother the thin cut fries even though he ordered wedge. The server brought out a new order of wedge fries and we got to keep the thin fries too which I suppose is a good deal unless you're watching your fat intake.  It was my brother's birthday so they brought out a free pizookie. Everyone seemed to enjoy having a little taste of this. I had two spoonfuls and that was more than enough, very sweet.

Jennifer C.,"Burbank, CA",152,110,4,1.0,4/19/2009,"I really really need to rant about the dinner I just came back from.  Tonight has produced a laundry list of irks that has gotten this BJ's blacklisted. At the end of our meal, our waitress asked if we wanted Pizzokie, and we decided to go for it.  While we waited, we paid for the bill, and she returned the change with a ""Thank you, have a great night.""  We thought that was a bit odd, and wondered about the state of our beloved Pizzokie.  We figured maybe someone else would bring it.  So, we waited.   Our waitress was really great at avoiding eye contact, and walking in the opposite direction, btw.  After 28 minutes, our patience dwindled.  We had to catch another waitress in passing, to ask for the pizzokie.  She sent the request to the kitchen, and said she informed our waitress and the manager. Again, waiting.  Ten minutes later, the waitress and the chef came to apologize for the kitchen's mistake (...no manager...hm, interesting.)  The waitress said the pizzokie is on its way, and it'd be refunded in cash.   Ok.   Waiting, and in another five minutes, PIZZOKIE!  Yay!  We ate it in under five minutes, but had yet to receive the refund we were promised.  All the while wondered where the hell the manager was.  Another 25 minutes passed.  And so did our patience. We had to call yet another waitress in passing to specifically request to speak with the manager.  He finally showed his face, and when he got to our table, all he did was cut us off and speak over us.  He wouldn't fully hear us out, and assumed he knew all our grievances, so he went through the same old crap we already heard, cash refund, yada-yada... and after all that he had the nerve to ask me to smile.

Lets not forget the salt content. It was spicy and salty. I will give credit to the Andouille sausage. Its flavor was unfortunately the compensator for the crap dish.  Yes I meant crap and NOT crab. My boyfriend was unfortunate. He had a nice white salad with stale croutons. I tried a crouton..every eaten a dried baked potato? That was the crouton. His main dish was a steak which was sub-par at best and then it came with a giant baked potato. No one can fcuk up a baked potato which is why this place gets one star.

This place seemed understaffed especially at the bar. There were only two bartenders behind the counter there when I went with a couple of friends. It was one tall black dude and one shortish, white gal. All the seats at the counter were filled up with people so ordering over people was a bit annoying especially when you're trying to speak over that corporate jerk talking about his ""company goals.""  When the black dude finally came around to us, he asked for our ID's. We gave it to him and then turned around and ignored us for a good 5 minutes while he was filling up beers and cocktails for other patrons that were on the counter. When he finally came back, he gave our ID's back and then asked us what we wanted. I asked for a Stella and my friends asked for Hefens. He turns around and ignores us for another 5 minutes. At that point, I was like ""wtf??"" He and his partner was apparently making a large order for a group on the other side of the restaurant/bar. When they finished making that big order and placed it on the server board to have it whisked away by a waiter, he finally came back around and got our beers. He whisked away my credit card and didn't return it until another 5 minutes later. Notice a pattern?  I don't blame the bartenders though. If anything, I feel sorry for the bartenders there. If only the managers there would lend them two more guys or gals to help them out, the bar would be an excellent place to chill after work in Downtown Glendale.

The set up here is slightly different than the one I usually go to in West Covina. I think it's smaller, but has a large outdoor patio which I've never seen at a BJ's before. It also appears to be a bit dimmer, which is good. I like dark places.  I drove here for a co-workers birthday, and what should have been a 30 minute drive ended up being closer to an hour because my stupid azz got lost.

Justin G.,"La Canada Flintridge, CA",60,13,,2.0,5/29/2008,"Bjs is pretty much a disappointment.   I used to love BJs back in high school.  It seems like at least once per week I'd be driving my girlfriend and some of our mutual friends out to Burbank to get pizza and pizzookie, and it was fun, if a bit expensive (f-*k you Carl for always ripping the toppings off the pizza so you could ""eat the saucy bread"" and never picking up the tab. . .)  Anyway, those days are gone, and are replaced by the days of BJs Glendale. Days of infamy. When BJs first came to Glendale, I was stoked. Not stroked. Stoked. Why? Because Glendale sucks. Glendale has very little in the way of variety when it comes to lunch fare. Glendale perpetually smells like garlic and onions, and not in the good way. Glendale's trash trucks drive around with signs saying ""Don't trash Glendale. Don't litter"" and you wonder ""What does it matter? This city kinda sucks anyway"". But BJs offered that brief ray of hope. Sure, it's a really similar concept to CPK which is just up the escalator from it, and there's an Olive Garden in the same building. Sure, I can't take advantage of the beer selection at lunch. But there was hope nonetheless, in the form of their salads, and their deep dish pizza, and their lunch specials. Hope that was in vain, it turns out. Why? Because the food just doesn't do it for me anymore. It's over priced for one, which was excusable when I liked it. But lately it just feels like eating anything from there is akin to trying to use Crisco as an exfoliant. It's greasy, it's over priced, it just doesn't cut it. It's hard to really attack the food of a chain restaurant. It's all the same, and BJs seems to be pretty consistent. Not bad, but not thrilling anymore. It is what it is. But I will say a few words about the staff: they're nice, but incompetent.  Of the 6 or so times I've been there since it opened, I would say that 4 times involved a complete screwup on the order. Once it actually worked out to my benefit, because they ""had forgotten to make enough small pizzas"" that morning, so we got a medium instead.  But the rest of the time it's been kind of annoying. Worse, I can't use this restaurant as a lunch spot. IT'S TOO DAMN SLOW.  Every time. Without fail.  I don't know if it is because the restaurant is short staffed (though I doubt it, since people have stopped eating there during lunch as they realized it is slow and it's remained slow even with the decreased customer load), or because of some inefficiency in the kitchen, or what. But it's a problem and it hasn't been addressed properly by the restaurant's management.  If I order a salad, it will take 20 minutes minimum to get it. Usually it's more. Nobody comes around to refill drinks. God help you if you need to get the bill quickly. It's not even like I'm ordering pizza or chicago style deep dish pizza. Everything takes at least 1.5 times as long as it should.  As a consequence of all this, they don't get much of my business. I do like their beers though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=700

Poor slow service or rushed food? Not at this BJ's. I think i fell in love with our waitor from the get go but that has nothing to do with my 5 stars ;) I've never been to a restaurant with more than 10 people so when I saw how fast they seated us and how fast our waitresses/waitors were attentive to us I was very pleased. Right away they introduced themselves to us, took our drinks, and placed our appetizers. As our drinks came, we had 3 waitors and I could hear the small conversations each one stirred up with my family members. How cute? Their menu is grand, I couldn't select just one thing so I just went with the Crispy Chicken Sandwich. I recommended the desserts to my family since everyone was asking me what dish they should order. Thankfully each section of the table ordered different appetizers AND main courses. I'm not sure on B.J's policies when it comes to parties larger than 7 but they gave us 24 free beer shots! It was the most nicest gesture. I'm not a beer drinker BUT i had two shots! (forcefully shugged by my brother and uncles)   Kids ordered chicken tenders and burgers. The women ordered pasta and sandwiches, the men ordered steak and chicken.  We never ran out of our drinks, our service was super attentive and even the manager came out and asked each of us how we were doing and asked with a smile!  This B.J's sits right on the corner of grand avenue before The Americana Mall. Its structured fairly big but makes you feel adequately comfortable. The inside lounge had a fireplace and looked cozy as the outside was more spacious but very New York-like.   Service Great! Food Delicious! Atmosphere Comfortable!

Mary S.,"Van Nuys, CA",31,43,4,1.0,4/5/2012,"I do not understand why Yelp does not allow you to give a place no stars. This BJ's does not even deserve half a star. One of the worst BJ's Restaurants I have been to and one of the worst services received from a restaurant. The whole place reeked of bad service. The bad funk started right when we walked in. The girl handling the front desk was so incompetent and had no professionalism. I get that it was packed but you need to keep your cool and do your job. I could have slapped her and that would not have helped. We finally get seated and had to wait several minutes (well over 15) to get a menu just to look at. We actually had to get up and ask another waiter to bring over a menu. When our waiter finally comes around she introduces herself and this man she was training. Before I continue with the rest of the bad funk..... Why would you have the MOST incompetent employee training new staff.....WHYYYYYY????? We were starving when we arrived here and we probably lost about five pounds waiting for our food to come out after we finally ordered it. When they finally did bring the food out my Asian Chicken salad had NOOOO dressing....none what so ever. Really if I needed to cut down on calories I would have told you. My cousins California Chkn sandwich did not have mayo and it was requested and my friends order was actually okay. My cousin did not make it a big deal and decided to eat it anyway UNTIL she realized the chicken was bloody and raw. We then had to hunt down our server because she disappeared again. We did not find her but found the man that was in training. He apologized and took the plate away and said he will have the server come by. My cousin waited over 10 minutes for the server to come by. The whole time we thought they were bringing out a new plate but instead she just came over to ask if my cousin wanted a new sandwich and that the manager would be over to speak with us shortly after. My cousin asked for another COOKED sandwich.  When the manager came over (which we had not requested) he was not apologetic at all. He had the nerve to tell my cousin that they were not trying to kill her or anything.....and not even in a sarcastic way...So then he got a mouthful from us. We waited several minutes after and still no new sandwich for my cousin. You would think these people would make it a priority after they ""tried to kill her"" by feeding her raw chicken. We once again went on a hunt for our server (who was not apologetic at all) and told her we were leaving and wanted the check. We told her we do not want the sandwich or to be here for another second.  The trainee apologized and tried to be as accommodating as he could but what can a trainee do for us.  You would think our server would try to get us out of there fast since we were not so friendly at this point. Instead we had to ask another waiter to hunt her down so we can pay our bill (minus the sandwich) and get the heck out of there. My friend actually tried to tip our waiter but we had to stop her. Tip her for what....the horrible service and her attitude.

We were graced with a salad, potato skins, chicken wings, and pizza for the all-you-can-eat festivities. Everything was really good and worth the price we paid ($17/person). My only gripe was the staff was a bit slow on refilling the food for our little banquet. Didn't they know they were feeding about 30 people (mostly college students and Yelpers)?

This BJ's has a great selection of beer and even beer flights, but the food is just okay.  It's just your typical American fare.  The pizookie, of course, is delicious, but I've only ordered it once since I've been too full (and too cheap) to order it again.   I've found that this BJ's is lacking in customer service.  I have to ask for my water to be refilled and once, I asked for water and didn't get it.  It also takes awhile for the check to come.  This is one of those places in which every time you need the waiter, he's never around and whenever you don't need him, he seems to pop up.   With standard food and no extraordinary service, this is one of those places you should stop by if you're super hungry and want a good beer, but not if there's a much better restaurant around (which in Glendale, there are plenty of other places). And in case you're wondering, I've been trying to figure out what the ""BJ"" in BJ""s Restaurant and Brewhouse stands for.  It's apparently some great mystery because so far, I can't find the information online or the official website....it can't really stand for the obvious, can it??? Update: I emailed BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse to ask what the BJ in the restaurant stood for and the director of operations emailed me back with the following response: ""As far as what BJ's stands for it is just a name no meaning behind it.  The original owners picked BJ's as the name it does not stand for anything.  I hope that helps.""   So either the original owners were smart - or geniuses!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=620

Dony P.,"Los Angeles, CA",38,73,5,3.0,4/7/2009,"I've always enjoyed BJ's for what it is.  A good place to sit down and have some greasy foods, beers, or that piezookie thingamabob.  But I wanted to give props to this one in Glendale.  I thought the service was very friendly and attentive.  They had cooked our deep dish pizza wrong in the kitchen, so the manager came out and told us they had to start another one.  This was good, because he did not want us to sit and wonder what was taking so long.  I appreciated the honestly in telling us they needed to start over.  In the interest of getting our food to us as quickly as possible they brought it out, when it could have been cooked a little bit longer.  Normally I would send it back, but it was good enough to eat, and my girlfriend and I had a show that we were attending, so we didn't have time to wait.   So instead we contently ate it.  The manager came back out, to ask how it was, and I thought I would answer honestly and said the pizza could have been longer to fully melt the cheese.  I could have lied and said everything was perfect, but I figured he wanted to know, so I told him.  He apologized and we were surprised to later find out that they charged us nothing for the pizza.  Now normally this sounds like a less than ideal dining experience, but I really do appreciate everything they tried to do for us that evening.  They start our order over just to make sure we got what we wanted, and that it was good.  They tried to serve us in a timely manner, and made the effort to follow up on the food.  When they discovered it wasn't fully melted, they made it complimentary, because I'm sure they want us to come back.   Normally, I find that the food is good and consistently what you expect from a sit down chain restaurant, but I just wanted to highlight the particular care we received at BJ's in Glendale.  These people will treat you well.  I want to give 3 and a half stars, but maybe I can give it 4 after a few more visits.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=720

Gergana B.,"Redondo Beach, CA",101,84,2,3.0,1/7/2011,"I rarely write review for chain places (because really, what's the point?) but this BJ's was among the better of the locations I've visited.  I have to start by saying I am a fan of the type of food they serve--most of the time I will be happy choosing from a wide variety of plain, American-style food: salads, soups, big ole sandwiches with a pile of fries, pastas, and of course their deep dish pizza.  I usually order off the sandwich menu and have yet to find something I don't like. Their soups are hearty and the pizzas are rich, although I've had friends complain about the chunkiness of the sauce. Food always gets a solid 4 stars.  This particular location is actually quite a bit better than the others I frequent. It beats the Westwood location as far as wait times, layout (the Westwood one is impossible to navigate), more grown-up clientelle, and parking! The Burbank location seems a bit more family-oriented, and the fact that they have valet only sucks! Parking and crowdedness also knock off point for the Culver City and Belmont Shore/Long Beach locations. In relation, this BJ's has a lot more going for it than the other locations I frequent.  My only gripe with this chain is their beer--for ""hand-crafted, silver award winning"" brews, they are hit-or-miss and pretty mediocre. The pale ale is the only one I remember being special, and I even remember being so disappointed in their brown ale I shudder when I see it on their menu.  Oh well--I will keep visiting you for your tasty sandwiches and pizzas and just forget the beer, BJ's-- if you bring the bruschetta and ""Together at Last"" appetizer combo back, you might become a regular place again. For now I'll stick to the Yardhouse for stellar beer and above-average American bar food.

Ninkasi D.,"Pasadena, CA",32,121,4,4.0,11/7/2007,"Updated Again: 2/14/08 - The GM sat down with my friend and I, listened to ALL of our concerns, and was SUPER responsive, rather than being defensive about the things outlined here. There's been a major turnover in staff and things are improving. Updated 1/27/08 -It didn't take long for this BJs to loose two stars - and believe me, those are only for the beer, which is sometimes far from being spot-on. But the reason why I've reduced my rating from four stars to two is because, with the exception of my first visit there, there hasn't been ONE time that I have eaten here when there wasn't an issue with the quality of service received.  For example: during a recent visit on a Sunday afternoon. I wanted the fish sans chips - in other words, fish n chips w/o the chips.  Our waitress was polite and helpful, took our order quickly, repeated it back to us, and brought our drinks to us without much of a wait. However, things went from good to awful when a server came with our food, slammed it down on the table and walked away. Problem was, she brought fish and chips - exactly what I didn't want - and there was no sign of my salad.  After about five or so minutes, I managed to get her attention and explained to her that I'd ordered fish only, no chips and wanted a substitute salad instead.  Without a word, she stomped away, and came back a few minutes later and SHOVED - literally SHOVED - the salad across the table at me. I said - politely - ""Excuse me, but ...."" and before I could finish she said, ""You wanted a salad. Well there it is."" And she stomped away again. Rather than make a scene, I quietly asked another server for a manager. We explained the situation to her and she apologized profusely for the behavior of this person and gave us a complementary pizookie.  Other weird stuff has happened since then, including being brought our bill WITH our meal and being told that it was a company policy.  There were two occasions where our party had to wait 20 minutes for our drinks, and then had them served in plastic cups because they ran out of clean glasses. C'mon folks - it's a BREWERY with a full bar, for goodness sake! People WILL order drinks, and plenty of them! The food quality has gone down rapidly, as has the service, which is sad because when this place first opened, it wasn't unusual for me to come here two or three times a week. I work on the opposite end of Brand, and the place was a favorite among our sizable group. Sadly, we will have to find another place to frequent. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ There's a new BJ's Brewhouse in town, and from what I've experienced so far, it's good - really good!  I've been a long time frequenter of the Arcadia location, and have been to Burbank several times as well. The food in Arcadia is sub-par compared to what it used to be about 5 years ago, and we always get spotty, if not weird service in Burbank. I love the decor at this location, which is less sports-bar-esque and more restaurant trendy for the office crowd on North Brand. There are still a number of televisions scattered about, but this place seems to be more about enjoying a good session beer or two (of which they have a few), or a night out with a special someone, or just to hang with friends. But I don't go to BJ's for the decor, I go for the brews. And considering that this place is brand new (just over two weeks old at the time of this writing) - and given that a lot of things can go wrong with house brews,  these guys mostly got it right the first time. My favorite BJ's brew, the Piranha Pale Ale, was a bit flat the first night I visited. Not quite enough CO2 in the mix for my taste, and not quite the level of signature hoppy bitterness I prefer. But the Nutty Brewnette (not me - the beer) was spot on, and was smooth like butta.  On subsequent visits - and there have been a few because I work just up the street - every beer I've had has been fresh and tasty, just like momma likes 'em. As for the food...I've found BJ's to be sorely lacking in the grub department as of late, but the folks in the Glendale kitchen have it goin' on. From pasta to fish and chips, the food I've sampled here has been well prepared, served hot, and is quite tasty. And last but not least - service. I know these folks are new, but on one occasion, we were seated at a table near the bar, and while nearly eight different servers passed us by, not one stopped to see if we'd been helped.  Finally, after having his back to us and serving the table immediately next to us, I caught the eye of one guy who rather reluctantly asked, ""Has anyone helped you?"" We said no, to which he replied, ""Well, I don't know where the guy is who is supposed to be here, but I guess I can help you. "" Gee, thanks? Other than that, I've been quite happy with my overall experience here, and I'll definitely be going back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=740

I know that we got there late, but that is no excuse.  If they don't want to serve people after a certain time, I have an idea....don't stay open late!!!  Instead, I guess they figure they'll just ingore anyone who comes in at a certain time.  Not cool!

Nez P.,"Eagle Rock, CA",99,107,,3.0,1/25/2010,"My friend and I wanted to have dinner + drinks last night, and decided on BJ's because it was close to our area. There was a 30-45 minute wait, but I couldn't blame them because there was a football game on and no one was leaving. When we were finally seated, we started off with the avocado egg rolls which I found to be surprisingly good. It had a sweet dip on the side that complemented the avocado really well. As for drinks, I had a Pomegranate Sunset, which I liked. It wasn't strong, I didn't get a buzz, but it was refreshing. My friend got the Raspberry Lemon Drop, and it was way too sweet. In fact it tasted like liquid candy. Between the two of us, we couldn't even finish it, but I could say that it was stronger than the one I had.  For the main course, I had the fish tacos. I did not enjoy them AT ALL. I don't even know what possessed me and made me think that a place like this would have good fish tacos. They were super dry, even with the dips and chips on the side. I finished one and had to force-feed myself the other one. That definitely killed my experience there. Then we both had Strawberry Splashes, which turned out to be an all-time favorite. It had the consistency of a smoothie and had a slight pineapple aftertaste. Again, it didn't give me a buzz, but oh well, we both enjoyed it. Service was a little slow. We started off with a female server who went MIA on us. Then about half an hour later, a male server approached us and said that our previous server had gotten cut and was sent home and that he would be our server for the rest of the night. I thought that because we had a new server that we would get better service, but it took forever to flag the dude down. Whatever. So its minus a star for the slow service, and minus a star for the waste of 9.75 fish tacos. Oh and for dessert, my friend and I shared a White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Pizookie. It was good, but I'm glad I split it with her because it was too big for just myself.

Pizza S.,"Burbank, CA",2,28,,1.0,3/29/2008,"It's bizarre reading the reviews for the Glendale location-- not because they had odd experiences, but because I had one with a lot of similarities to theirs as well. The scenario - Birthday party (not mine, but thanks for asking)  on a Friday night-- 15 of us. We booked in advance the day before to ensure a table. We get there-- sorry, no reservation. Strike one. Strike two came when we ordered appetizers, which, while tasty, apparently don't come with serving plates, silverware or napkins for the patrons that order unless you have to ask for them.  When our individual orders were placed, I and one other friend ordered individual pizzas.  45 minutes later (and most of our glasses nearly empty), the both of us were brought little stands for the pizzas to rest on... only to have the food brought another 20 minutes after that.  If they implied our food was ready with the stands, they ultimately decided it was probably best to have it all brought out at once and tease the both of us-- and the staff had no concept as to who's dish was who's.    Strike three. We (and by that I mean the whole lot of us) felt that the percentage included in bill for tip for large parties was too much for the poor service and inconvenience we experienced there, but rather than being poor sports, paid it anyway, happy to be getting out of there.

Couple of times service has been lacking.  Today, Friday night, was by far the worst restaurant experience we've had in years.  We go out regularly so its pretty telling that it's never been this bad.  Mgr said they've had other issues w/ this server 1st day.  Who starts new person on busy Friday?! We had to ask for utensils.  One of our 3meals arrived 20minutes after others.  We ordered a long island ice tea and she brought them in kid cups!  Server blamed kitchen, didn't apologize for mistakes.  After complaining mgr comp'd & said she'd send over couple of to-go boxes, never happened but that's nothing given everything else tonight.  We didn't eat our food & we will not be going back.  Horrible service!  Whatever is going on @ glendale BJ's it's not good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=740

Dave L.,"New York, NY",112,130,13,2.0,1/1/2009,"BJ's really needs to get their acts together.   I came here with a group of people.  Now, let me ask this question.  What are the odds where two of our orders came out wrong? We had ordered two small size pizzas and to our surprise, two mini's were severed.  Upon complaint, they immediately rushed for two new small pizzas (Mediterranean and Mushroom).  Even these came out mediocre.  One of the pizzas was supposed to be served with mushrooms and yet, BJ managed to forget this.   What made the experience that much worse was the fact that our waitress was suppose to bring the mini pizzas back out for us to snack on, but instead, she returned claiming that it was thrown out.

Jesse L.,"Glendale, CA",2,28,,2.0,8/25/2008,"If it wasn't for tasting BJ's food at other locations, I surely would have given this location one star based on my sole experience at the Glendale location.   I went to BJ's with a group of friends late on Friday night.  We were seated on the patio.  It took a LONG time for us to be acknowledged by our server.  My mealtime companions and I were happily chatting away, however and barely noticed the delay.  When the server finally arrived with our beers, she announced that she was going on her break and that another server would be looking after us in the meantime.  This other server that was allegedly supposed to be watching over us never appeared.  After another VERY, VERY LONG while a third server brought out our salads.  Our entrees arrived less than two minutes after the salads, dropped off by yet another server.  I must emphasize the ridiculously long amount of time between the time that our food was ordered and it arrived.  Our food was cold.  All of it.  We would have complained, but no one ever checked back on us.  Several of us had fries with our meals, yet there was nary a a bottle of ketchup to be found on the patio-- and no server to ask to bring us one.   Eventually, we got tired of waiting and ate our cold, condiment-less food anyway.  As I mentioned at the beginning of this review, I've eaten at other locations.  I've always found BJ's food to be above average, if uninspired chain restaurant fare.  As it turns out, though, it really sucks when it's cold.  Long after we had finished eating, our original server reappeared.  She asked us if everything was okay (it wasn't) and dropped off the check. Luckily, the evening wasn't entirely ruined.  My party still had a great time talking and we enjoyed our beers.  There was also some entertainment provided by other members of the BJ's staff.  We watched (in horror) as a hostess seated a couple at a nearby table that still had dirty dishes from the previous guests.  The best part was, she walked past several other clean, unoccupied tables to do so.  We also watched with amusement as another server (actually the one who was supposed to be watching us while our first server was on break) poured a glass of beer out of a pitcher for the table next to us.  Apparently no one ever told him that the standard procedure when pouring a beer is to go slowly and tilt the glass-- he failed to do this, filled quickly filled it to the brim, then seemed surprised when beer foam exploded out of the glass and all over the table and its occupants.   All of this leads me to believe that ours was not an isolated incident, and there is some incredibly poor training going on at this restaurant.  I will gladly drive to other locations rather than returning here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=780

You could get a better pizza if you ordered delivery and it would have been cheaper.

I have only been to BJs in Burbank before going to the Glendale  location. I love their berry cider, avocado eggrolls, and the pazookie.  So when it opened up here I decided to go there for my b-day with hubby, daughter ,sister, and mother.  I like the decor of the place ,,, however ...since I guess they are going for an upscale sports bar kind of thing...it's like being at the game in one giant space.  Since there are no partitions, the noise level in incredibly loud.  I don't think designers today consider this factor.  In Burbank, although there are room separations, the back room ceiling is high, and you can literally not hear one word the person sitting across from you says.  Huh?  Huh?  How many times can you ask someone to repeat something without looking like an idiot?  Or deaf?  Ha...  Just nod and say 'yeah' alot politely like you understand, and if someone gives you a really funny face...you know you shouldn't have said yeah that time!   ;o) Anyway, G-dale is super loud and obnoxious.  Except it's EVERY seat.  I got up and crusied around to check out the whole place...it's all loud.  Our waiter was a cute little fellow who was super enthusiastic - maybe a little too much so with no real skills to back it up with.  I immediately ordered my cider when he 1st came by.  The appetizers came, I asked about it ... he replied with 'it's on its way!"" ... the meal arrived, I asked about it ... he replied ""it's on its way""... I started eating and I asked a busboy about who brings the drinks...he said he would check.  I was about 1/2 way done before waiter-guy came by and told me that they had run out.  Run out?  And he didn't know this a 1/2 hour before?  This was only one problem ... and kind of a major one since you want a drink...especially when it's your birthday...and dweeb-boy knew that.  In fact, my sister was paying for the event and she specifically asked for the check when we were done, and he promptly handed it to my hubby.   These are just a few of the overall problems we had.  Sure, it was newer then, but their system sucks.  Either they have too many tables per server, or the areas are too big, or something's wrong.  We could never find our guy in the vastness and noise and my elderly mother was having a fit about the whole thing.  One thing I do know is this ... I haven't been back since, and probably won't go again.  Just left a bad taste in my mouth, even though the eggrolls taste great!  If our work group has a lunch, I'll go.  But to pay for it myself...HIGHLY doubtful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=800

min k.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,57,20,1.0,1/25/2012,"came here today for lunch with two others. we ordered the cajun pasta, fettucini alfredo. both with chicken. we also had some tacos. all were lunch specials and the pastas came along with soups. the soups were chilli and clam chowder. first off, the servers were friendly and nice. when i came to the food, yuk. the soups came out later than the pastas. the chilli soup had a strong smell and taste of hard liquor. the clam chowder tasted exactly the same as the progresso chowder except much more salty. the pastas came along with two pieces of garlic bread as well. i've never had nasty garlic bread, and this is the one. omg.. the fettucini.. wow... it tasted sooooooooooooooooooooooooooo bland. the sauce wasn't there and omgomgomg wtf?! seriously?! i was jst eating cuz i felt bad for the person who treated me out for lunch. and even that person said dat dish was a ripoff. and my pasta had no chicken when it came out. but later the server brough me the chicken. i would've forgotten lols. anyways. if you want to get some food, i would recommend microwaving frozen meals.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=800

Then we spoke to the manager who acted like he was completely bewildered and didn't know why the service was slow. Ok so I returned Monday for their $5 martinis & Mojito's around 4:00 and there were like 20 peopl in the whole place again. The drinks were horrible I returned the Cosmo and the mojito and just had the beer.

Paulette F.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,71,2,2.0,1/22/2008,"I've never been a fan of BJ's.  But my best friend loves it, and now that there's one in Glendale, she is in heaven.  Which is why I agreed to go there tonight. This is the LOUDEST restaurant in Glendale.  So loud you can't think.  Forget about talking to your friend across the table.  Especially if you're sitting next to one of the numerous groups of 12+ people OR the obnoxiously drunk girl who has nothing better to do on a Tuesday night than blow out everyone's eardrums because she mistakenly thinks it's cute for her to slam her drinks on the table every time she shrieks her high-pitched laugh. It's not.  Don't sit next to that girl.  Especially if she and her boyfriend keep getting up to go to the bathroom together... I don't give this place much credit.  First, BJ's is an awful name.  Not because I have the mentality of a 13 year old boy but...well, I have the mentality of a 13 year old boy.  Second, the family atmosphere doesn't really do much for the ""micro brewery"" image.  I can't reconcile families sharing a pint while the little ones scream in their high chairs.  I'm sure it happens, but I don't want it to while I'm trying to enjoy a beer.  Especially the screaming kids part.  So really, I just come away feeling like I spent the evening at TGIFridays or some other chain I've never set foot in.  At least Gordon Biersch has its machinery on display.  And doesn't cater to the family crowd! That said, I have to give our server credit.  Apparently they've been trying to work on their slow customer service, because she made a remark about how quickly the food made it to our table.  Even my friend said she'd never gotten her order so quickly.  And my sandwich was pretty good too (had the turkey cobb, without the bleu cheese dressing--ick!).  The drinks, on the other hand, took forever.  Like they had to go to the liquor store to buy more soda.  Soda!  It wasn't even a mixed drink that I could understand taking a while to get.  Oh, and another weird thing is the super slippery floors.  From the faux stone entrance to the hardwood with the tongue n' groove design...it's like asking to fall on your ass.  Be careful if you're in heels! Food was decent, service was fine, but on the whole, the place kinda sucks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=760

The potato was effing TERRIBLE.  I will say that the only redeeming thing about BJ's is the beer and the clam chowdah.  Honestly, how do you get Clam Chowder completely right and fail  m i s e r a b l y  on the ribs, potato and chicken??

Joolie T.,"Brooklyn, NY",1069,1296,1004,2.0,2/10/2009,"eh. i want to give a BJ.... not go to BJ. j/k. sort of. the selection of beers is nice. i'm not a beer person, though. give me some cider and/or hard liquor, please! the location of BJ's is in the busy part of Glendale. the wait for a table isn't too horrible on a Saturday night. the layout of the place is quite reminiscent of Outback Steakhouse... very open and not private. the service here is spotty and on the slow side. our server never checked up on us, messed up our orders and forgot essential condiments or special requests we kept reminding her (and him... we had TWO people to our table) over and over. these reminders never worked. i was miffed.  the menu is basic Applebee's/Cheesecake Factory/Outback/TGIF standard. everything they offered made me snicker and scoff. i couldn't find a light entree to eat. i ended up ordering some basic salad. i was not dazzled. the large plasma tv's distracted me from the boring food, anyway. a little TOO MUCH distraction, though. there were too many different games playing on the screens... i was getting severely dizzy! we ordered a birthday cookie pizza for our friend- he seemed to love it. i didn't even touch the thing. again, something about BJ's food made me want to gag.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=760

John S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,,1.0,11/3/2012,"I went on a Saturday night with my family for dinner at BJ's about a week before Halloween.  The last time I was here was about several years ago so I could not recall if the food was good or not.   When we got there, the place was not overly full so we were seated promptly.  Our server was friendly and took our orders.  We started off with three appetizers which were shrimp in lettuce wrap, flat bread pizza, and fried calamari.  For drinks it was orange juice, pumpkin beer, and cola.  The cola was flat and had no fizz.  The pumpkin beer tasted awful.  Orange juice tasted watered down.  We complained about the cola and orange juice to our server..  The cola was replaced and it was better.  As for the orange juice, our server told us that other customers had complained about the same thing.  Our server told us that the orange juice they use is for mixing cocktails and not for drinking straight.  This made no sense to us.  If you know this, why would you keep serving people watered-down orange juice?  I was given a choice of a substitute or a refund so I chose cranberry juice.  I asked our server if the cranberry juice was going to be the real thing and she kind of rolled her eyes and told us yes.  She brought the cranberry juice.  I tasted it and it was the genuine thing. I would rate our appetizers as being poor to good.  The good was shrimp in lettuce wrap.  In fact, this was the best of all the food that night.  The fried calamari tasted like cardboard.  The flatbread pizza was only decent because it had too much oil.causing the bread to be soggy.   We also ordered two entrees which were shrimp and sausage jumbalaya and shrimp scampi.  The shrimp scampi was not that good.  There was too much breading or what seemed like it.  Maybe the breading was actually parmesan cheese.  Whatever the case, it did not taste good.  The jumbalaya was actually pretty OK except it was too salty and the sausage were too thin. The final price was $87 which did not include tip.  Final summation:  the place was not worth the price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=760
Ryan H.,"Milwaukee, WI",761,203,57,3.0,10/29/2009,"this is one of those places that i think suffers because of how large it has gotten... the food is excellent... the service is hurting a little bit though... anything these people do with a potato is golden... they have giant heart attack baked potato filled with 10,000 worth of goodies, enough for a meal, but here in america a baked potato is only a side so this is tricky... their potato wedges are excellent as well, like excellent.... they also have amazing mashed potatoes, some cheese flavor they add to them makes them in the top five i've ever had... also probably the worst for you... their pizza's are good but nothing to write home about, also nothing to mention first in my review obviously... they also have the pazuki's the fresh cookie desserts with ice cream on top... this is the only time i will probably ever say this, but skip the starter just to make it to the dessert... its worth it... they have numerous flavors of cookies, and the ice cream itself must be made from the utter of a holy cow because it is just that good...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=760

OK - parking - in the garage - very far away from the restaurant so that sucketh. Secondly, the noise level in this place is off the charts - at lunch, at dinner, in the room with all the TV's or the ""dining"" area. You can barely hear yourself think, let alone the person dining along with you.  The food is pretty decent, but it usually arrives tepid. It's also difficult to get a waitresses attention at this location. They seem to be focusing their boobs, I mean attention, on the male customers who more assuredly tip them more. If you don't order alcohol with your meal here you apparently don't exist. They push alcohol more than the food. The only redeeming part of this location is that it is near the best part of Glendale so if you are shopping you can stop in for a bite. (Chicken salad pretty darn great!) Maybe they will hire some male, non alcohol pushing, waiters and my next experience will be better and my food might be warmer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-glendale?start=760
