Eric U.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,2,,4.0,9/4/2017,My favorite late night place for an awesome  Pizza . Last Saturday night we decided to have a pizza so my first choice has always  been BJ's.  We placed our order for beer and waited for the pizza . We noticed It was taking longer than normal for our pizza when the Manager came up and notified us that the pizza was sitting in the window and someone else took it to another table for another customer so we waited for another one to be made and delivered. I know this was no fault of our waitress but when we finally got ours delivered it was cold . I didn't say anything about it being cold but I wanted to .  I feel sorry for the waitress since she told me this had been happening all night to her orders.  We will keep visiting BJ 's since we love the bar and home brewed beer. The pork chop dinner is the best one around Indy,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-greenwood
Lisa B.,"Carmel, IN",4,43,2,1.0,11/6/2017,"The service was horrible, 10 minutes for our server just to greet us.  Our appetizer came out before our drinks, good luck ever getting a refill.  The food was ok, the only really good food on the menu was the mash potatoes.  I think this location needs better managers and employees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-greenwood
Sanford R.,"Bloomingdale, IL",6,349,2,3.0,11/2/2017,"My experience here was ordering take-out. It was a decent dinner, but I think I was expecting a little more. Perhaps it was due to me ordering pizza here though, because my wife really loved her steak. The signature deep dish pepperoni was OK, but not quite amazing. However, both my wife and I loved the pizookie we had for dessert.  I think I would give them a second chance if I ever am near one again. It looked like a nice place to sit down for a meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-greenwood
Nick S.,"Columbus, IN",136,27,5,5.0,12/31/2017,"This place is fun. I first discovered BJ's Brewhouse in Ohio near my college. Then I happened to run into the original California location on a college spring break trip. This chain has certainly evolved from that original pizza shack. The Greenwood location is a huge TV-equipped restaurant with an even larger menu. The deep dish pizza is still a highlight, but if you are like me, you will probably be looking for a lighter meal after filling up on craft beer and appetizers. They have great burgers, Mediterranean Pita sandwiches, and surprisingly salads. Of course they have the Pizzookie, too--essentially a cookie cake baked in a deep dish pizza pan--that is always tempting. Service is quick, and they have a cool app for their loyalty program and to-go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-greenwood

I love the parmesan crusted chicken with mashed potatoes and broccoli. They bring out little garlic bread knots for the kids right after you order, which helps keep them occupied.

Jason A.,"Indianapolis, IN",18,215,2,3.0,5/4/2017,"Not a bad place, I ate here a couple of yrs ago and didn't think good or bad, it's moved up a spot since then. Got in after a day of errands, was tired and it was the closest thing. Place was busy, got seated immediately, waitress was attentive in and out at just the right times. Split the kale/roasted brussel sprout salad, really good, got a small veggie pizza, not bad either drank water as I wasn't feeling the beer thing so late. Got in and out for a little over $30, can't complain. I know it's a chain but this place is a little less sysco-ish than it's neighbors, price point is slightly higher but food quality is better imo.

I also enjoyed the burger I ordered. Really, the worst thing here was the service. We were one of maybe four tables at the time and our waiter was still MIA whenever we needed more to drink, checks, or anything else. He also didn't have a great grasp of the menu when we asked questions and then blamed it on corporate changing things all the time. So overall it was a fine meal, but staff that know what they're talking about and are around to talk about it would really help.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-greenwood
David M.,"Indianapolis, IN",29,89,57,5.0,10/2/2016,"I love this place , the food is great, even better is the beer selection. I come here for a good burger , I really enjoyed the smoke house burger. Also if you want a burger you can feel good about , the bison burger is 700 calories and is delicious.  Wings are hot and crisp and awesome . But here's the best, the staff are top notch when it comes to service . They always are very nice. But here's where it Gets good, so my wife was looking at our bill and was complaining to me about how much it was. Little did she know the waiter was behind her and proceeded to take our bill and said he was gonna take care of it. Came back with 10 bucks off. Like for no reason!

Mike B.,"Great Falls, VA",17,38,82,1.0,9/23/2017,Not your typical BJ restaurant.  I go to the BJs in Virginia and Pittsburgh on a regular basis.   We were a group of five.  Four of the meals came out and my dinner didn't come out.  We had to ask as we weren't told what happened.   I had ordered shrimp tacos. - not a long prep time item.  Every other member in our party had finished their food before the manager took the time to come over to apologize. My food arrived at same time as our check arrived.  The manager said they thought other manager  had handled the situation or moved the miss order up in the process - neither of which happened.  Very disappointing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-greenwood
Jalee L.,"Indianapolis, IN",124,122,244,5.0,5/15/2016,"I am very comfortable with the statement that BJ's is in fact my favorite Pizza in the Indy area. It's a lot of commitment, I know, but I have been through the gamete of local pizza joints and chains alike and nothing can rival the perfection. It's thick (more than hand-tossed, less than true chicagoan) with a blended crust (not rimmed) that is buttery, but never greasy. It's pepperoni is more than just circular, its cubed, sliced and chunks covering every inch. As the name implies- it's Pepperoni Extreme.  It pairs perfectly with BJ's Pizookie (Yes, a cookie made in a pizza tin) served with ice-cream. Cookies & Cream, Triple Chocolate Chunk, Peanut Butter, Macadamia nut, etc etc. Go all the way and do 1/2 & 1/2 on the pizooki flavors. Peanut Butter and Chocolate paired will never lead you wrong.  Since you are at a brewhouse- give the Jerry Burst a try. It's a mixture of Jeremiah Red and a Berry Burst Cider. It lightens the beer and balances the cider's sweetness. If non-alcoholic is your preference their homemade cream soda will hit the spot.  Needless to say, with a meal like this, I wish yelp would let me give 10 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-greenwood
Kim H.,"Greenwood, IN",0,4,,1.0,12/12/2017,Never again! My last two meals were atrocious!!! First meal we were a party of five. Three of the orders were okay but the other two YUCK! The stuffed mushrooms had to be sent back and we finally received them at the end of the meal. My salad had the wrong dressing and my husband's steak was so rare ( ordered medium) he had to send it back. Second attempt at the steak was just as bad- overdone and he couldn't even chew it. Tonight we tried carry out - deep dish pizza. I called and was told I'd have to wait another 5-10 minutes because it wasn't finished. No problem. It was cold and dried out. Not what I'm expecting for a fresh pizza that I had to wait longer for. BJ's is just too much money for very subpar food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-greenwood

I got a lunch item off the low calorie menu - a chicken pesto sandwich with four cheese mashed potatoes and it was good! The potatoes were very cheesy and actually kinda intense, but I liked them. The sandwich was...it was good! But probably not worth the cost. It was about $9 and the bread had been oiled and grilled so it was flavorful but all I could think was how unhealthy it was. Could have used more pesto. Overall tasty.

My husband ordered fish tacos and said they tasted like cheap fish sticks.  Aside from the questionable choice of fish tacos, I've had some hit or miss meals there too. For example, the chopped barbecue salad doesn't suck.  The service is also hit or miss...so basically, it's a crap shoot on if it will be a good night or not. Best to avoid if it's busy, as luck and service will NOT be on your side.

D C.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,12,,2.0,3/24/2017,"Frequented this location several times and usually decent service. Last visit however was terrible. I was there with my fiance - we both state our orders at the same time along with ordering an appetizer to split. Appetizer comes out fairly quickly, but then a good 30-40 minute wait before the server shows up with the fiance's entree. We inquire about the second entree and was told it would be right out. A good 15 minutes later, the second entree comes out....COLD! Server basically disappears for a good 10 minutes (he had literally only two tables filled in his section) - when he returns, I mention that I would like my meal remade since it was brought to me cold. He said it would be fixed and a few minutes later the manager walks over. All he would offer is to basically microwave my dish - no option for it to be remade or something else. After expressing interest in wanting it remade and the manager failing to see my point, I finally agree. My dish is brought out about five minutes later - biting into it, the pasta is now dried out and there's little sauce left from the microwave.

It was my last meal before going back to LA, so they let me choose a place to eat. Upon my research on Yelp, I saw BJ had seared Ahi Salad so I have this place a try.  I ordered clam chowder in a sourdough bread bowl, and it was delicious. Bread was nice and warm. Fresh tasting.  Then Ahi salad was good. Salad was fresh and Ahi tasted ok. Except it tasted like it was just defrosted, perhaps defrosted in microwave. The flavor of fish usually goes away if frozen. it takes more flavor if microwaved. And that Ahi tasted like that.  I ordered west coast IPA on tap. So delicious. Good stuff Everything else was good. I particularly satisfied with the server. She was a top notch. Speed, consistency to fill water, demeanor and language. She can probably work at five star hotel with no problem. Perhaps that was just Midwestern standard.

They have great lunch specials. My wife had one that included a tomato and mozzarella salad and personal size pizza. She thought it was good, and at $6.75, it is a bargain.. I had the avocado egg rolls. Delicious!, just a little pricey at $10.25 for six.and too many for one person. They are meant to share.

Ryan F.,"Greenwood, IN",0,11,,1.0,6/10/2017,"Unfortunately, my experiences here continue to get worse each time I dine here.  Tonight I decided to do three (3) appetizers instead of a main entree.  The brussell sprouts were burnt and over crispy (e.g. the kitchen and/or the runner should not even have allowed this to leave the kitchen) the stuffed mushrooms were soggy and very small, and the ahi poke was missing two (2), poki sauce and avocado, of the six (6) basic ingredients.  A complete disaster of a meal.  The couple sitting next to me received the wrong entree because the waitress pushed the wrong button on the new automated ordering system they are using.  When even appetizers are a disaster it is time to move on to other dining options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-greenwood?start=20
Shelia M.,"Greenwood, IN",0,14,12,5.0,6/9/2017,Lunch is my favorite time to eat here at this greenwood BJ's. Why? Because they have fabulous lunch specials!!! I pretty much always get the half California Chicken Club (yuuummm) then you get to pick a salad or soup.  Tortilla soup is awesome!! Then u can pick a side. It says it comes with fries but you can get a baked potato or veggies if u want instead. (No extra charge)!!! Definitely download the app!! They have offers on there all the time like a free appetizer with a food purchase. Plus I like to rack up points for money off my next visit.  This location is def 5 star in my opinion.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-greenwood?start=20

Building is older and outdated but that's just the kind of place this is. It's definitely not a fancy place but that's why the locals like it. Parking can get a little scarce when it gets busy so you might have to park on the street The food is mostly your standard pub food with Pizza, burgers and sandwiches. Not much for the health conscious here. Good flavor and quality but like I said just pub food and that's ok. Booze, decent selection. Better than most pubs in the area.

The food, whatever you choose, is consistently good.  Sometimes the service is a bit slow, but it's mostly because it is a HUGE place and always crowded.  A few items of note: Pizza - deep dish - amazing.  From individual to large, it takes a bit longer but worth the wait.   Burgers - very very good. Lemon Chicken - delish Bread bowl soups - fantastic. If you're into the beer scene (think brewpub, not Budweiser) they have a full menu of in house brews.  And for the kids (or people like me who prefer the soda to the beer) they have their own root beer and cream soda on tap - both amazing, and as a bonus both come with free refills!

The steak was shameful, barely lukewarm and completely devoid of any flavor - tasteless and unseasoned.  The ginger creamed corn sounded like a good idea but the ginger was way over the top, this dish still has some potential if they aren't so heavy-handed on the spice. It looked like a baked potato but a loaded baked potato is a far exaggeration.  The bacon was burned and the potato overcooked, no sour cream, chives or butter was on it and it appeared to be re-heated.  I requested butter, sour cream, etc after my meal came without it. If it's actually possible, the potato had no flavor & the cheese on it was quite waxy.  I had a cocktail, the Pink cadillac...also rather bland and nothing to write home about.

The pizza was good but honestly not much better than a pan pizza from Pizza Hut. They also put tomatoes on their pizzas standard.

So I made my way to the bar where I stood for over 5 minutes before someone acknowledged me (it was 4pm...nowhere near a dinner rush). While I stood waiting for someone to wait on me, there were about 6 staff members standing around and taking.  Finally, I was able to place my order after the first bartender  told another bartender that I was there and needed to be waited on.  I ordered my growler and while I stood waiting for it, I was greeted by a pretty awful sour smell. Not sure if this was from the bar, or perhaps an area that was unclean near where I was standing, or what. Either way, the smell was pungent and highly off putting.  Overall, I used to be able to quickly stop here for growler and feel welcomed and wanted as a customer. This was not the case today.

When the food was brought out by someone who was not our server, it became clear that the server had completely forgotten the three salads we had ordered.  About five minutes later, our server pops by to see if we still wanted those salads.  I had chosen a salad instead of fries, so yeah, I still wanted the salad I had ordered. Fifteen...FIFTEEN more minutes go by and salads are brought out and, get this, they aren't the right friggin salads!  At this point. We ask for our check, inform the server that we no longer want salads and that she needs to remove them from the bill.  More time goes by and we finally get our checks and not even a single lemonade was comped after such a terrible experience.  That's poor customer service, folks.   The food we did get was mediocre at best and not hot.   Ugh.  You guys, this place is really awful.  Generic and awful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-greenwood?start=60

Anita G.,"Indianapolis, IN",2,26,5,4.0,7/2/2014,"5 months ago I came here with people from work for the fist time and wrote a review, because of Shannon, our amazing server. I am happy Management read it, that means they are using this system which totally replaces stupid cards at the table that you can fill out, but never will. So I came back to this place for lunch the other day and we got seated again in Shannon's area, because I knew I would get great service again. Shannon isn't the kind of server though who greets you with a high pitch voice and gets all excited about it. She is professional, who most of the servers with high pitch voices aren't, and again, she is knowledgeable. She knows the food she sells, she can give you honest advice about certain meals and is just a professional, friendly, highly efficient server.  We ordered a salad with roasted brussel sprouts and they weren't really roasted. Tip for the kitchen: check out how the Barefoot Contessa does ""Roasted brussel sprouts"". Ever since I make them her way, my entire family eats brussel sprouts. Overall the salad was very good. The Moroccan inspired Salmon was good, but the Couscous wasn't real Couscous. They didn't use granules of durum wheat, which is the main ingredient in couscous, instead they used something different. Anyhow, the taste was good. As long as I get seated in Shannon's area again, I will be back for some more great service (hard to find these days) and good food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-greenwood?start=100

We were a little bummed to hear this, but the offerings on their beer list were enough to make a couple of microbrew lovers happy. So that's not a huge deal. We were informed that they were running a special that night, soup or salad for two, a pizza (large I think), and a desert for like $20 or $25. We were all over that. The pizza was pretty damn good. And the crazy Oreo desert was pretty delicious too, and I don't even like Oreos.  Service was great and the vibe inside this place is pretty cool too.

Scotty Z.,"Indianapolis, IN",23,124,2,2.0,11/19/2011,"Capitalist economies have a middle class; restaurants do too. Somebody's gotta be average. This place is somewhat analogous to a politician: you want to like them, they seem pretty decent, but when push comes to shove, there really isn't a whole lot of substance. I reeeeeally wanted to like this place....but even ""like"" would be too strong a word. My girlfriend and I each sampled some delicious beers...but they weren't extraordinary...nor cheap. We each split two dishes plus an appetizer. All of which were good...but again, very conservative flavors, dabbling on the dull side here and again. Nothing really stands out -- sort of like that politician, who doesn't want to take a chance on doing anything bold enough to jeopardize their chance come next November. I almost gave BJ's a third star, except for their beer sampler, which pissed me off. They have ~8 beers, ranging from dark to light. Their sampler is such that one may only sample the top 4, or the bottom 4. When I asked if an exception could be made (as, I was curious how they did both a lager and a red ale), our apathetic, bimbo server gave me some canned answer about ""that's just our policy."" And...not coming back again is just my policy. Policies are great...if you're the IRS. I will say -- the restaurant itself was gorgeous. Upscale, warm, classy, and inviting, it'd be a great place to kick back after work. The bar has plenty of room, and you won't be claustrophobic in the dining room either. All in all -- I'd like to recommend this place...I would... but down the street is both a Bravo and a Cheesecake Factory (one of my favorites), both of whom seem to work a little harder (both in the kitchen and the front of the house) for my money.

Nat H.,"Indianapolis, IN",110,26,5,3.0,9/30/2014,"I am giving 3 stars because I have had better experiences here before, but let's talk about the last birthday we had.  It started out with me struggling to squeeze into the cramp space (and I'm pretty small person.) I usually sit at the bar which is more spacious, and as I learned, provides a higher level of service. I suppose the mood didn't start out so well when the waitress spilt water all over my sister and me. She didn't offer us towel; we were on our own to collect napkins around the table to dry our seats up. I guess she felt that calling us all 'sweetie' continually would make up for it. So we're waiting for the food, the kids trying to color but the crayons kept breaking. No big deal. Some had salads. The wrong salads were given to the wrong people which became complicated when it not was realized until after bites were taken. My aunt ordered rice and found a white piece of plastic like maybe part of a lid in it.  Good thing she's a nurse; she can give herself the Heimlich. Sadly, the food was just bad this night.  Ribeyes were tough and rubbery; not edible. Carrots had brown spots on them. Very thin asparagus and very stingy on the broccoli. One thing they were very generous with was lemons. Everything seemed to be garnished with lemons. My sister ordered the Maui Maui tacos, she couldn't find the Maui on it; lots of lettuce though. So it wasn't all bad - everyone who ordered a chicken dish seemed to be happy. I had the pesto mushrooms and fried artichoke which was pretty interesting.  I could have used a breath mint afterwards though. The desserts were unimpressive; the sundaes were mostly whipped cream.  It was okay; I've had worse, but I've had much better.  In the end though, the server literally stood over my chair until I paid the bill and then gave me one last condescending 'sweetie' for good measure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-greenwood?start=100

Our server was very nice, her name was Ashleigh, very good at her job, not pushy or overbearing and not aloof and inattentive, just right. I decided to try the featured bear, the ""Nit Wit"" a Wit beer, which I really did not care for, it was a little...sour, I guess is the word I would use, not really the style wheat beer I am used to. I switched to the Hefeweizen which was passable, but forgettable. Next time I will probably go for something heavier. We enjoyed the food, though certainly not multi-star material. It was acceptable. We were hoping to get the ""Together at Last"" appetizer a combo of bruschetta and spinach dip, two of our favorites on one plate, but regrettably they were out of the bruschetta so we opted for the spinach dip singled out. It was good, I particularly liked the toasted Parmesan cheese on top, though again, not the best I have ever had. For dinner my companion ordered fish and chips, which is a staple for her. It was one of the best fish and chips dishes we have sampled in recent memory, though I only had a bite or two, I think I would consider ordering it again. My dinner was a turkey burger ""classic style"" (1,000 island dressing, Lettuce, Tomato, on a toasted Brioche) the patty was kinda thin which left me wanting more turkey burger flavor, but over all it was OK. I doubt I will ever order a burger there again, and I look forward to going back for some of the signature pizza. Over all I was pleased with this restaurant. It does not get any awards from me, other than maybe service and hospitality, but I'll go back, after a try a little bit more of what Greenwood has to offer. Though it took me six years to have dinner in Greenwood, I hope to get back much quicker the next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-greenwood?start=140
Dan R.,"Greenwood, IN",0,5,,4.0,3/5/2010,"This place should have a higher rating in my opinion. They have a huge menu with a ton of options. Their pizza is really good. And they have a good assortment of beers to offer. If you get their weakest beer on the menu you won't be impressed, you will need to select one that is stronger. My only complaint is the prices seems a little on the high side. I think the prices have to be set a little high to pay for the massive amount of staff they have working there. Always seems like you see 5 to 8 workers just standing around. Overall it is one of the better places to dine on the south side.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-greenwood?start=140

We got in the restaurant early tonight when it wasn't busy and more than ten tables who came in after us got their food before us. We had a 2 year old and a 6 month old with us and they were at their wits end when we asked about our food. The excuse we heard was that ""the sandwich line is backed up"". We talked to a manager, and all they offered was free desert. We had two fussy kids and were not about to wait another hour for dessert. We had two bills and they took the appetizer off of one and did not adjust the other one at all.

Matt S.,"Indianapolis, IN",3,32,,2.0,10/12/2010,"With each visit to BJ's I'm less impressed. I've been three times now and have been disappointed by the complete lack of healthy options. I wouldn't normally promote salads but BJ's has a Mexican inspired salad that is pretty good if you order it without the onions (if you forget to go sans onions, they put nearly an entire onion on the salad). Really, I keep ordering the salad because nothing is good enough to get me to eat that many calories. And believe me, I'm not afraid to eat an unhealthy meal if it is going to be worth it. I will say that the service is very good, but I've always experienced a long weight. Do yourself a favor and skip BJ's, it is really just a slightly better version of the standard cookie cutter Applebees type restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-greenwood?start=120
Rachael S.,"Greenwood, IN",0,18,,1.0,8/31/2014,"The food  here is typically way overpriced for the quality you receive. i think the fact that this place has so many options makes it difficult for the cooks to know how to prepare everything properly. Every time I've gone it's been extremely hit or miss, with the last handful of times being definite misses. I went once when it was somewhat busy, and I had to send my steak back because it wasn't cooked properly. When the waiter brought me a new one (after everyone else at my table had finished their meals, of course), he sat it in front of me and without saying a word, walked away. The steak still wasn't cooked right but I just wanted to leave at that point. Then last night while being seated the hostess had her phone in her hand/was using her phone the entire time she was working, and our waitress seemed to care less about us as soon as we got our meals. This place desperately needs a management overhaul. I've never seen so many employees doing so little at once.

Sure, the place is huge and filled with mall people. But the food - especially the avocado rolls, shrimp wraps and pizza - is spot-on every time. And the beer ain't too shabby, either. They have their own brews, and also Stone IPA on draft. That's an immediate positive bump of one star. For being so big, the place is actually quite comfortable and appealing. It's not too loud.

We had their 2 for $20 deal with a each of us getting soup/salad, a medium gourmet meat deep dish pizza, and then a shared dessert of the the pizooki (sp?... basically a pizza cookie that may possibly have been one of the best desserts I've ever had). Needless to say, we had MORE than enough to eat and only at half the pizza there, so we got some awesome leftovers. Definitely should check this place out!

The place is big and open, with lots of TV's adorning the walls. Seems very family friendly The service was pretty good, the waiter we had was right on top of everything. He definately made sure that when our beers started getting low, he was there to ask if we wanted another. Quick, timely, friendly service. It helps that we were there with my brother who appears to be a regular, or at least he knows this particular waiter. The food was actually pretty good, we got the deep dish pizza, and it was much better than I expected. We also got the pazooki for dessert, and it was terrific. The variety of menu items was very nice too, lots of options for everyone. The beer was much better than I expected, my wife got a sampler of all 7 of thier offerings (excluding the IPA), so I got to try each of them. Good stuff, The Pirhanna Pale Ale is particularly good. I got a pint of the Kolsch (really good), the IPA (Very good, but not quite as good as the Pale Ale), and the Imperial Stout (Pretty good).I was fairly impressed overall. The only let down is that they don't brew thier beers on site.
