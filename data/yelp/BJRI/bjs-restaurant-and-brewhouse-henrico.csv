Charles B.,"Richmond, VA",64,103,240,4.0,9/20/2015,"Very nice atmosphere third time and have never been disappointed.  The service is great, plenty of seating so wait time is short even on a Saturday night.  The pizza and draft beer is what BJ'S is know for but there menu is huge, not quite Cheesecake factory huge but lots to choose from.  Plenty of beer and drink options. I had the BJ'S classic pizza and the medium and two salads filled us up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico?start=40
Jerome J.,"Goochland, VA",49,28,26,4.0,10/31/2015,"I crave the food here all the time. I was a little confused about this place at first but now I really like it. The restaurant is open and there is great seating. The atmosphere is inviting and comfortable. I've been here a few times and you will not leave hungry. They give generous portions and have a great selection of meals to choose from. I personally enjoy the pulled pork BBQ sandwich which I can nearly taste just thinking about it. Their pizza also looked very tasty and ,again, portions are excellent.  The beer is also great. I like the fact that they do have their own craft beer and it is very tasty. I like that you can come in and have your growler filled inside. I would recommend this place to beer enthusiast and those looking for a great meal with large portions.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico?start=40
Erica G.,"Richmond, VA",64,140,826,5.0,12/6/2015,"If you are wanting a great deep dish pizza complimented with a great libation then head over to BJ's Brewhouse. BJ's is a beer lovers haven. They have a vast amount of beers, ales, ciders and signature cocktails to choose from. They definitely give Capital Ale House a run for their money with their IPA choices. Some of my personal favorite adult beverage selections here are the Blonde Ale and the Berry Cider.  On my most recent visit they had some seasonal berry themed cocktails in lue of the impending holidays. I decided to indulge on the blood orange pom sangria. It was full of flavor but the sweetness of the wine was mellowed and balanced with a cinnamon stick that gave the drink a hint of spice. It was delicious! There are so many unique pizza selections at BJ's. From traditional pepperoni to the sweet pig, there is a pizza for everyone. My friend and I chose the BBQ Chicken Pizza, which was absolutely amazing. This deep dish creation includes juicy chicken accented with fresh tomatoes, cilantro and savory bbq sauce. We definitely enjoyed our pie!  Make sure you leave room for dessert so you can try out their pizookie. A hybrid of a cookie and a pizza, the pizookie is a great ending to any meal. They are served hot, and sweet topped with a scoop of ice cream. My mouth is watering reminiscing about this sweet treat. We couldn't decide on just one flavor, so we got the trio of peanut butter, cookies and cream and salted caramel. Every bite was worth the delicious calories. I am already looking forward to my next visit to BJ's to try a different pizza and pizookie!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico?start=40
Ernesto G.,"Lorton, VA",22,26,19,5.0,7/9/2016,"Great staff, outstanding atmosphere, excellent food!! The deep dish pizza is fantastic, the beer selection is diverse even for this Guinness drinker.

Nancy K.,"Manakin-Sabot, VA",0,3,,1.0,2/21/2017,"I had good things about the pizza at BJ's, so I ordered a specialty pizza for take out. While the crust was deep-dish, there was not even a hint of a yeast taste so prevalent in good NY pizza. The crust, in fact, was very rubbery and unsatisfying. The toppings were unremarkable. They certainly did not taste fresh. For the price I certainly expected so much more. Very disappointed. Won't go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico?start=40
Anna V.,"Henrico, VA",0,15,,3.0,7/14/2017,"I like the look on the interior. Very extensive menu, food and drinks were pretty good.  Have been 3 times so far. Great for late night. I would go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico?start=40
Elaine L.,"Chesterfield, VA",78,2,,2.0,7/8/2017,"The food is good, but the service is absolutely terrible. It took us an hour to get half of our tables food and another 20 minutes to get the rest of the tables food. And it wasn't busy at all! The food was good but half of it was cold by the time it got to our table.

Chris L.,"Midlothian, VA",67,459,18,4.0,9/22/2015,Been here several times and always good.   Not the largest beer selection in Richmond but one of the best varieties.  Their BJ's house beers are very good but they also have on draft many other selections (including light beers for those that aren't into craft beers - something many craft beer restaurants bypass). Food has been very good including the burgers.  I took off one star because we have never been overly impressed with the pizzas (which they have a large selection).  Everything else has been first rate. They kinda don't take reservations.  For up to 6 people you actually can get the BJs phone app and do the call ahead function to put you on the list.  There is also an order ahead option which you could in theory use for a reservation.  You can place a Dine In order for a specific time - so I have in past ordered appetizers dine in for a specific time (thus reserving our table). Not normally a long line except weekends between about 6-8 can be up to 30 minutes from walking in.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico?start=40
Grace L.,"Las Vegas, NV",150,58,164,4.0,6/30/2015,"I first learned about BJs while out in Vegas and was excited to discover that there was one here! This location did not disappoint.  Wide selection of beer and solid food offerings. On this visit we got the spicy Hawaiian deep dish pizza and a lunch portion of the Cajun chicken pasta which came with the option of a wedge salad.  Portions are pretty good, I could have gotten two meals out of the lunch portion of pasta. However the ""Cajun"" flavor left more to be desired. For me it was more of just a chicken and tomato pasta, didn't really seem Cajun to me.  Deep dish pizza is definitely the way to go, and get yourself a salad to go with! I'm pretty picky about my salad and the wedge was satisfying to me.  To top things off we ordered a sampler of three pizzookies, which is always a hit!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico?start=40

Alisha A.,"Richmond, VA",0,7,,5.0,7/17/2016,"I've been to two locations, the one here and in Daytona Florida. Both equally as amazing!  The meat lovers pizza is a good portion, has a ton of meat, and always makes you drool. The burgers are cooked to your liking and has the best selections of toppings. Their burger sauces are unique and a perfect addition. The pazookie is a must have if you're ordering dessert but something you could easily make at home.  The atmosphere is not loud but can be if there's an important game playing at the bar.  Service is fast and very attentive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico?start=40
Kimberly L.,"Chester, VA",12,16,4,2.0,1/9/2017,We ordered a large pizza and baked ziti a couple days ago for take out and it was disappointing. The pizza and baked ziti was very over cooked and dry.

Ralston W.,"Chesterfield, VA",43,76,323,4.0,4/26/2016,"I came in earlier with a guest and it as around 11am. I like off peek hours as I can enjoy myself. It quickly got packed and my tranquil experience was bombarded with noise and happy conversation. The way a good place should be. Our server was very nice but the guy who brought out the food. My guess pointed out how sad he looked. I hope everything was alright but he was almost killing my noon day joy buzz. Place is clean, large. Great choices and did I say my weight staff was amazing.

Sara F.,"Mechanicsville, VA",29,9,55,3.0,5/25/2015,"I went here for lunch in the middle of a marathon shopping spree with my mother. I had the Crispy Jalapeno Burger and it was excellent. The burger was cooked medium as I asked, and the shoestring french fries were crispy. The burger had just enough of a kick to make it a touch spicy, but may be too spicy for people who don't like hot food, What troubles me was the way the beer was served. I ordered the porter, and the staff did not know how to pour it correctly. It was served to me with six inches of head on it and in the wrong type of glass. It baffles me to be a brewery when the staff doesn't understand the beer. After waiting for it to settle, the porter was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico?start=40
Dave W.,"Glen Allen, VA",0,17,,1.0,10/22/2016,Ok 2nd visit was worse than the first If you want beer and pizza I guess it's mediocre at best. All food cooked in pizza oven so never order anything but pizza  Fish in a pizza oven????  But even worse this time when they brought our appetizer they brought us DIRTY side plates!  Told manager who did nothing! Employee who brought dirty dishes to any table should have been terminated or at the very least reprimanded!

Grace K.,"Glen Allen, VA",0,6,3,4.0,11/15/2015,"My boyfriend and I decided to try this place out after hearing really good things about it. I didn't realize what type of restaurant it was; I thought it was just another Kickback Jacks/Applebee's type of place. I was very wrong.  BJs has a very diverse menu and offers quite different things from a typical American restaurant. It made it very unique. Their menu was like a novel. So much to try and it all looked delicious.  We went on a Friday Night so it was very very busy. We waited about 20 minutes for a table. They ask for your phone number so they can text you when your table is ready. Downside to this is there is not much wait space, but I mean most restaurants don't offer a big waiting area.  Got our table ordered drinks, all good. Our waitress was very very nice and fun to talk to. The kitchen was pretty backed up so we did have to wait around 30 minutes after we placed our order.  I got the chicken pita tacos, which are similar to a Greek gyro. They were awesome, but I believe that they forgot to put the sauce on. I was so hungry I scarfed them down before I made the connection there was no sauce.  My boyfriend got a pulled pork burger. He was unhappy with the small amount of pork on it, but he still said it was very good. The French fries were good, but very small and difficult to eat. They almost tasted like onion rings to me.  We then got a chocolate chip pizookie. Only complaint there is they did not put em out Pam spray on the tin; it was very difficult to scrap the bottom of the cookie off. Other than that it was delicious.  We were there for a little over an hour between waiting for food and our dessert. Prices are reasonable for what they offer. Will definitely be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico?start=40
Gladwin G.,"Mineola, NY",84,92,108,4.0,2/25/2015,Went here just for dessert. It was the cookie and ice cream on a skillet. It came out quick. The cookie was warm and the ice cream wasn't drippy. It was perfect.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico?start=40
MaraLee L.,"Petersburg, VA",0,41,31,5.0,10/4/2015,"First time trying BJ's and it won't be the last! This place it great! Delicious food, great drinks, and friendly wait staff! We came in to try the Party for Two deal. So glad we did. The atmosphere in BJ's is great, very relaxing even when the big game is up. The happy hour deals and time is awesome. We got there right after the lunch crowd while the game was on and was surprised and happy to hear about the happy hour deals. Whilst we were enjoying our salad appetizers, Luke, the manager(?), came over to ask about our experience. After hearing it was our first time, he was happy to see what our tastes were in drinks and chose custom drinks to try. I tried the Berry Cider and it's my new favorite. My mom tried a drink recommended by Luke that mixed a light beer with the Berry cider, it was awesome. Now to the important aspect, the food. We each got a salad, which was a niiiice salad for a starter. Then the pizza came, a delicious deep dish ""Sweet Pig."" I can't believe how light and flavorful this pizza was. So good. But then dessert happened, and it only got better. We shared the Peanut Butter S'mores Pizookie. Om nom delicious!! All that said, I cannot wait to come back. I immediately joined the rewards club, so I can start getting some points. :D",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico?start=40
Sandra F.,"Midlothian, VA",15,4,2,3.0,4/20/2016,"I saw pics of the deep dish pizza online & immediately had to try this spot! The ambience was really nice and cozy. The hostess greeted us right away & found us a comfy booth. The waitress came with menus right away & got us drinks! So far so good.. I order the deep dish pepperoni/spinach, cut into 6 slices vs 4 (I was told they were big) and an order of French fries with a side of ranch.. The food didn't take too long, I'll say 20 mins or so.. I was so hyped to try this & super hungry! My pizza was not hot/fresh, like at all.. I'm thinking a fresh pizza would have sizzling cheese, I would have to wait a minute for it to cool but no I was able to hold the slices as I attempted to cut them.. (Attempted, bc I only had a butter knife & it wasn't cut into 6 slices like I asked) finally took a bite & it was as if the pizza was made a bit ago, only luke warm. The French fries were the same but really taste old.. I asked for a fresh batch & a side of ranch that she forgot.. When the new order of fries got to me, I could tell they were fresh.. The grease was an obvious sign & I could feel the steam as I reached for them.. Unfortunately, they weren't all that good.. They taste like crispy air (over cooked).. No potato, just fried, crunchiness with no real taste without the ranch.. Very disappointing to say the least.. I didn't eat all of my food so I order dessert, which looked promising! I ordered the salted caramel pazookie (I believe that's how u spell it) it's basically a big cookie, with 2 scoops of ice cream, Carmel drizzle, chocolate chips sprinkles on top & a hand full of strawberries (I order those separately to add a little extra flavor) Let me tell you this was by far the best dessert.. I've had in a while! It was the right amount of crunch and softness.. It was delicious!! Presentation was great as well.. The dessert made up for everything else that wasn't right! It was so good & I was obviously enjoying it so much that the guys across from me, said they had to order the same! Lol My friend & I both order one, co spidering how sweet it was we really needed water! Our waitress seem to disappear after we got our food.. We needed refills before the dessert even got there but got distracted by the pazookie's that we didn't get to ask her before she slipped away.. I will definitely give this place another try to let them redeem themselves.. For now I will leave the 3 stars bc the dessert was yummy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico?start=80
Cade Y.,"Henrico, VA",0,11,,5.0,12/19/2016,"My girlfriend and I had never been here before and we had gotten an early Christmas gift card to go here so we figured why not? We headed in early Sunday afternoon and were greeted by a super cheerful bartender named Cassie. She gave us a run down on the history, food they are known for and offered suggestions. Already loved the place based off of her alone. The second bartender for the night was Maggie and when she came over she gave us an awesome description of the beers and let us try a few. I hate beer, I have literally never liked it, but somehow Maggie found an amazing beer that BJ""s actually makes themselves. (Golden something or another, wheat beer) We had such an awesome Sunday dinner and will definitely be back to see Cassie and Maggie again soon, probably next weekend!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico?start=80
Shari S.,"Capitola, CA",62,148,64,2.0,1/19/2015,"First of all, my review was originally a one star, but I'm giving it a second star, since after I responded to their post-dining survey, I was promptly contacted by a manager, asking how they could improve. Hopefully that desire to do better will mean that they're just experiencing growing pains. A few key points that made our experience less than enjoyable: *We utilized the Preferred Waitlist option, but that was a total fail. The hostess really couldn't provide an explanation. *We utilized the Order Ahead option so we'd have appetizers waiting for us. Unfortunately, this was a fail as well -- and our server didn't even seem to know what it was about. *My husband ordered a beer as soon as we sat down. After quite some time, he was told that the beer had ""just run out"" and they were too busy to tap a new keg. *While the avocado egg rolls were great, the dipping sauce with them tasted horrible -- as if it had been boiled so long that the pot burned. We advised our waitress that it tasted so off that they might want to address it in the kitchen before they served it to anyone else, and she said she'd have a manager come out, but that didn't happen. *While the fried appetizers & entrees, as well as the pizza, were tasty, the Santa Fe Salad was jsut blah. And I requested more dressing, in case they accidentally used ranch rather than Santa Fe dressing... but that never came either. Overall, the decor is very appealing, and some of the food was tasty, but in an area like Richmond, and especially with the large variety of restaurants in Short Pump, you must do a lot better than just good in order to succeed. Hopefully these are just new restaurant growing pains that will improve with time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico?start=80
Kathleen M.,"Glen Allen, Richmond, VA",17,1,,3.0,6/19/2016,"Waited for 20 to 30 minutes which was fine as we got here right at 6:30.  Server was prompt and courteous.  Husband ordered a burger which he really enjoyed and was huge.  My Ahi Tuna salad was disappointing.  Salad seemed like it had been sitting in dressing for a while, there was a random piece of mozzarella in my salad and tuna was not presented neatly (I.e.

Rob C.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,33,1,4.0,7/1/2015,My wife and I love this place. We drive from Charlottesville and the food is great.

We decided to try their sodas.  I had the rootbeer and the hubs had the cream soda.  Both were amazing.  For lunch, he had the brewhouse burger and I had the grilled mahi taco.  we both enjoyed our entrees.

Now for service. .. we made the mistake of saying we needed a few minutes to look at the menu.   Took forever for the waiter to come back.   After we finally got our order in it was close to 30 min before we got our food and it was luke warm.   We had coffee to drink as it was lunch but our neighbors with beer and wine got much more attention than we did.

Raymond B.,"Richmond, VA",71,7,,4.0,1/9/2015,"I love the BJ's in Northern Virginia. This new location in Short Pump appears to be working out their service kinks. Food is great (as long as you order the right menu items as their vast menu which is 70% delicious, 20% so-so, 10% should be omitted altogether). Their pizza is pretty good as long as your like bready thick crusts/dough, but I prefer their tacos. Their wings are great (not breaded whew!) and we like to finish dinner with their pizzookie desserts which are simple, sweet, hot, and a la mode! I think they need a few months of service staff turnover to weed out the bad servers and as long as their service managers properly walk the tables, check-in with tables, expedite the food properly in the window, and stay on top of order/wait times per table after seating. Cross your fingers - we can all hope that the service gets to where it should be so Richmond can truly experience this restaurant at it's best!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico?start=80

Pablo W.,"Henrico, VA",0,4,1,1.0,11/8/2015,"English   I will never return to this place.  I really DO NOT reccomend it.  I had a horrible experience this Saturday 11/7 at 9:30 pm and it was the first time I had ever been there.  I asked for a beer without foam and when the bartender served it the beer had a lot of foam.  It settled and was filled to about an inch below the rim of the glass. When I ask the girl who ran the beer to my table if they could fill it up a little more she walked off with a horrible attitude and and the bartender whose name was ""Christian""  just let the glass sit there for a minute and then stuck a straw in it and stirred it around to create a foam that reached up to the rim of the glass. They brought it to the table with a rather horrible attitude.  Our waitress came back after this ordeal and asked if everything was ok, I commented what had happened and that I had seen everything unfold and that the problem was still not fixed.  She went to go talk to the bertender ""christian"" and he served me another glass with the same problem.  I accepted the glass even though I wasn't satisfied but the waitress insisted on resolving the problem and went to talk to the bartender.  He just ignored her and turned around to look at me with a nasty attitude while he and a different waitress ( a tall girl with black hair who was working in the bar area that night) laughed about the situation.  I thought that the bartender would have just fixed that problem seeing that all he had to do was put a little more beer in the glass but instead he chose to ignore his coworker, who was trying to fix the problem.  It really bothered me how he treated and ignored our waitress and his attitude he got with me looking at me as if he was challenging me. The beer cost 6.50$ for a pint and that's not cheap.  I asked for it without a lot of foam and  don't feel like that is an unreasonable request.  The bartender just didn't feel like pouring a decent glass of beer and chose to treat his coworkers and clients badly instead.  As for the food, the hamburger cost 12 dollars. The french fries reminded me of Burger King and the jalapeño burger was not spicy or anything as the menu said it would be. But these are personal tastes and maybe another person would like the food.   The attitude of the bartender CHRISTIAN makes me NEVER want to go back.  I do not recommend going to a place where they can't even serve a decent beer and they ignore your waitress when she tries to fix the problem and then laugh at you with the other waitresses. Our witress who was a blond was very nice and helpful, she was tryign to fix my problem with my drink and I appreciate that. The bartender and the other waitress who was working the tables near her were the ones that ruined the whole experience at BJ's.   I will never go back because of that bartender.   Instead of just topping off a beer he decided to let his pride get the best of him and he lost a customer and I will never recommend this place to anyone. I saw the whole situation happen right before my eyes and it really bothered me how he treated our waitress and his customers. SPANISH  No voy a volver nunca mas a este lugar. Realmente no lo recomiendo. Tuve una mala experiencia ayer sabado 7/11 a las 9:30,  y era la primera vez que iba. Pedí cerveza sin espuma pero me la sirvieron con espuma y bastante, pero cuando la espuma se fue quedaba como un dedo y medio sin cerveza, cuando le dije esto a la mesera se la llevo al  bartender llamado ""Chris"" y este dejo que el vaso se quedara allí y luego metió una pajita y la revolvió para ponerle espuma, lo sé porque lo estaba mirando. Pero mi pedido era sin espuma a vaso lleno. Cuando la mesera me pregunto si estaba todo bien , le conté lo que habia visto y que el problema no estaba resuelto. Ella fue a hablar con el bar tender, me sirvieron otro vaso y estaba el mismo problema, yo no estuve muy satisfecho pero habia aceptado tomar el vaso así pero  la mesera  insistió en resolver el problema entonces fue a hablar con el bartender y este  la ignoro dejo el vaso allí y luego el bar tender me miraba con actitud desafiante mientras se reía con otra mesera de pelo negro y alta, yo pensé que el bartender iba a resolver el inconveniente pero no lo hizo sino que ignoro a su compañera.  Me molesto mucho como él trato a la mesera ya que ella trato de resolver el incoveniente y su actitud desafiante al mirarme. El vaso costaba 6,50 USD, no era nada barato, entonces pedí lo que era justo.  Me dejaron con el vaso que me habian traido que no cumplia con lo que pedí  y NO lograron resolver el problema por que el bartender NO tuvo las ganas de hacerlo.        En cuanto a la comida, pedí una hamburguesa . Me costo 12 USD, la verdad que las papas parecian de Burger King, y no era nada picante la hamburgesa, como decia. Pero estos son gustos y seguro tendran otra experiencia. Pero la actitud del bartender hacen que NO me den ganas de volver nunca mas a este lugar ,y no recomendar este lugar, el tuvo orgullo..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico?start=80

The atmosphere is not bad, pretty  busy for a Monday night around 9. The stuffed mushrooms were ok, they seemed a little undercooked. I then ordered the Fried Chicken with no gravy or succotash and subbed in roasted asparagus instead. The chicken was mediocre at best, not horrible, not delicious. The mashed potatoes-white cheddar -were the best part.Both me and my best friend ordered the roasted asparagus, but it was so bad, we  requested subs-I got the seasonal vegetables-overly blanched and a little strange smelling mix of cauliflower, carrots, broccoli and snap peas.My friend got the fries, which were pretty tasty.Overall, I can see myself returning but ordering completely different.

Bullet Bourbon is not rare. There is no excuse for a bar to run out of any standard bourbon. Three of us went to dinner and had drinks and their flat pizza and our bill was $120! If you want overpriced spinach and artichoke dip, look no further. Unfortunately I, like the rest of us live on a budget and don't have money to throw away.

Ashley W.,"Amelia Court House, VA",1,2,,1.0,6/14/2016,"I rarely get my husband out of the house, but he agreed to come out for dinner and beer at BJ'S. He ordered a Dos Equis on tap, our server came back a few minutes later and said they're changing the keg and it would be right out. The beer came...and was completely flat. He asked her and she said well there is still some left and they don't want to tap a new keg, he could get something else or have another flat one. Couldn't believe it, you really expect your customers to drink flat beer at a brewhouse?! So he ordered a different beer and at the end of the meal asked if he could chat with the manager. He explained what happened (and noted the server and the food were great). The manager told him that he didn't taste the beer so he doesn't know if it was flat (so we are liars now?!), and said we had too much information and they don't serve flat beer. My husband walked out and as I was paying the bill  (including asking them to remove the flat beer we sent back), the manager came back and said he did go check and the keg was empty, that they should have given him a new beer and to apologize on his behalf.

Wael D.,"Conway, SC",44,15,3,1.0,7/3/2017,"My dad is obsessed over this place so I've been here plenty of times due to him. The food tastes decent, nothing life changing or anything, but it's good. My problem with this restaurant is the service. I've worked in the restaurant business for years and I've never seen a group of hosts/hostesses, waiters/waitresses, and even a kitchen staff so clueless and terrible at their jobs.  I've never walked in through the doors of this restaurant to be greeted by a host. The two desks for the hosts (which are placed one in front of the other instead of next to one another, what's up with that?) are always abandoned and you'll have to wait for minutes just untill a host or hostess comes to help you. I went yesterday for dinner and the restaurant was not busy at all and my dad still had to ask one of the waitresses if there were any hostesses working.  As for waiting staff, they aren't too terrible to be honest. They are nice people but they take forever to come greet you at your table and take drink orders which is annoying. Also, they will forget any small thing you change to your order. I always order a sweet tea with an extra cup of ice and I've never gotten that extra cup of ice with my drink, which isn't a big deal, I just ask them again. If you change anything on your order though, you are basically rolling the dice on whether it comes out right or not.   And now the kitchen staff. The kitchen does put out some good tasting dishes but they are notorious for being slow apparently. When I first came to BJ's with my dad and sister, my sister warned me that if you come here get ready for bad service wether it was a hostess, a waiter, or slow ticket times from the kitchen. She was definitely right.  I most likely will be dragged to BJ's by my dad again, but I wouldn't recommend coming here for dinner or anything, not because this place is terrible, but because there are much better places to eat in the area that won't have you leaving with a headache.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico?start=20
Sean F.,"Richmond, VA",103,239,1526,4.0,11/23/2016,"The restaurant is very nice and kind of upscale. It has a great ambiance and the staff is always extremely friendly. Most of all, their beer selection is quite impressive, especially for a chain restaurant. They have a great amount to choose from on tap and even more choices in bottles. Their website says over 160 beers! Aside from that, they're also known for their pizza. The pizza is great, but it's a little pricey. One pizza that I ordered came to $28.00, after taxes. Smh... All the other food seems to be reasonably priced and is quite good. Definitely a step above places like Fridays and Ruby Tuesday. Lastly, I would like to mention that on my last visit there, I ordered a pizza without chicken because my girlfriend is vegetarian. Unfortunately, when I picked up my order, there was chicken on it. I understand mistakes occasionally happen and I told them that it was no big deal. Even though I was very understanding about the mistake, the manager, George went way above and beyond to make up for the inconvenience. It really wasn't necessary, but I greatly appreciate it and it's instances like that, that show how great a business really is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico?start=20
Karen R.,"Richmond, VA",72,130,383,5.0,12/1/2015,"So, BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse has become one of my favorite places to dine!  I was actually exposed to the restaurant in California a few years ago, but I didn't really get the full effect then. I've been here with friends, for events, and solo, and all of them have ended up the same way... extremely pleased!  Whether its the beer selection, great pizza, or tasty appetizers, I always leave full and happy.  I haven't dived into their menu fully because I keep wanting to eat the dishes I've already tried again.  Unfortunately, I can get stuck get the same dishes at particular places! But, I can attest that their pizza - deep dish & flatbread - are both delicious.  I also had the Sante Fe Spring Rolls and they were perfectly seasoned!   A must-have when you visit is a Pizookie!  These desserts come in full and mini sizes, well most do.  My personal favorite is the Peanut Butter Smore's Pizookie!  I also love the Salted Caramel!

Jon B.,"Richmond, VA",185,220,192,4.0,4/1/2016,"On last Sunday I was on a mission to have lunch at a restaurant that I had not been to before. While on this mission, I came across BJ's Restaurant. I never even heard of the restaurant until about a week ago. But how did my experience go? To find out, read below.  The Good: Menu- From the looks of things, this restaurant is like Applebees on Steroids. Their menu focuses on sandwiches, burgers, chicken, ribs and pasta. The difference in a BJ's menu and an Applebees menu is the variety that BJ's offers. The menu itself has to be over 4 pages long. Those that are indecisive might take some time to make a selection but those looking for a specific taste in food will have a better chance finding it here than other restaurants that specialize in ""American Food"".  Price/Portion- I ordered the lunch special Chicken Tenders and Fries. Yes it was a safe choice in food, but the chicken tenders were around $7.50. This is a bargain considering that at other restaurants, their chicken tender meal is sold for around $10. The portion of the food was also pretty filling for the price paid.  Taste of My Meal- As stated before, I ordered the chicken tenders meal. The food was very good. The food came out hot and I did not need to add any seasoning to my fries. I could say that I was satisfied.  On the Fence: Service- The server was friendly and more than willing to accommodate any need of the table, but there were times when she disappeared for long periods and the food took longer than I thought it would take given the small number of people inside the restaurant.  Taste of the Root Beer Ribs- I had the chance to sample a rib from someone else that ordered the meal. The meat was a little tough and the seasoning was more of an acquired taste to me. It is definitely a dish that I would not order. Overall: If you are looking for a restaurant that has the Applebees on Steroids theme then this is it. The ambiance is great, food is affordable, portions are great and my group had overall positive reflections on how the food tasted. I could surely see myself coming back to this restaurant and I would be more than happy to sample other dishes on the menu aside from my favorite Chicken Tenders meal.

The place was not busy at all yet we barely saw our server. My friend finally got her to come by and asked for another beer and we waited at least 10 minutes for it to come. Calamari was what I expect from a chain restaurant and was so disappointed in my unseasoned and half cold fries. Sriracha Queso was pretty good when it was hot. My girlfriend did like her tavern pizza. If the service was good I may give it another try, but I won't be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico?start=20

Finally we were seated and thats when we Rebecca Y came along and sweetend the sour taste in our mouths. Not only was Rebecca bubbly and hosptalitable she recommended dishes and was attentive. We settle on the Garlic Parmesan one of Rebeccas favorites and they didnt disappoint. For our entrees we both got the Full Rack of Ribs special. That came with two sides, I had White Cheddar Potatoes and Roasted Brussel Sprouts. Husband enjoyed Asparagus & White Cheddar Potatoes. The special also included a house/cesar salad which complemented the wings perfectly. Our food came out in enough time so we wouldnt be forced to push food down our throat. We fined it out with the mini Pizookie. I had the Ghirardelli & husband enjoyed the White Macadamia Nut. The pizookie was warm and fresh.

From the moment I entered the restaurant I was greeted with care (and a gluten-free menu which helps) and felt right at home even in a chain restaurant. I do not order salmon often while out because most people (especially in a more casual dining environment) over cook it, but not here! The salmon was cooked to perfection! The vegetables were fresh and the menu choices overall were plentiful. Definitely a place to satisfy a group of people. If you have a gluten sensitivity, you will be pleased with the selection they offer. Oh and dessert! You must get a pizookie! It is their version of a cookie sunday. They feature a seasonal flavor (when I was there it was lemon blueberry. It was AMAZING!) And they also have regular chocolate chip and a gluten free chocolate chip version as well. Since I was visiting another city - and I wanted to spread the love - I did not get to go back to BJ's but that was a hard decision every day. To the staff: Well done guys from beginning to end.

Tiffany N.,"Charlotte, NC",1,5,13,1.0,11/15/2014,"Tonight I made my first trip into Bjs Brewhouse, I was let down a few times during my visit that I feel should be brought to your attention. Prior to my arriving at the restaurant I placed a reservation through your Preferred Waitlist, the confirmation said that I had a 40 minute wait.  Immediately after placing the reservation I received a text saying my table was ready, please proceed to the host stand to be seated.  I went up to the hostess stand and was told that they had clicked me in on accident and that my table wasn't ready, that I still had the original 40 minutes to wait.  This was fine and I had a seat.  The waiting room began to clear out to the point we had to stand when we came in and were seated by ourselves (6 of us) when we started to wonder when our table would be ready.  My friends also made a reservation when they arrived and they were told 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes at 6:45. They were told at 8 that it would be an additional 30 minutes to an hour.  At 8:00pm my husband went up to the hostess to check on our table which included two 4 year old children and was told that we would have an additional 30 minutes-hour wait and that I was quoted the incorrect time in the beginning.  Finally we were seated at 8:28 (through my friends reservation on the wait list) and we sat down and ordered, our waitress Tony was very friendly and apologized for our wait.  I received my text after we had been seated. When our food arrived 5 of our 6 guests received their meals, I assumed that they couldn't carry mine as well and that they would be back.  We continued to wait for more time as my friends ate their food and I snacked on some of my husbands dinner.  When Tony came around she checked to make sure everything was okay and that is when I told her that I never received my dinner, she apologized and went to find out where it was.  She returned with my dinner and I thanked her and began to eat.  After a few bites a manager named Luke came over and asked how our visit was going and I couldn't be quiet any longer, I expressed to him how disappointed I was with the wait, service, and that my food hadn't arrived; also that I was hungry and sharing food with my friends until my plate had arrived.  He replied saying jokingly that I had wanted to do that anyway with trying everyone else food, I laughed it off but was not in the mood after this visit.  He told us to let him know if there was anything he could do and hoped we had a good rest of our meal.   We received our check, paid and left; I was very disappointed with my first visit to Bjs and don't know that I would return or recommend it to any of my family or friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico?start=120

Amy L.,"Leesburg, VA",54,176,8,2.0,11/8/2014,"Overall, I'd rate this chain restaurant as Inconsistent. As another Yelper mentioned, the menu had food residue on it. I got a wedge salad that was mostly delicious but marred by a slimy leaf that should have been removed by the kitchen.   I ordered a pizza since that seemed to be a specialty.  About 20 minutes later, a waitress (not our server) comes by holding a large pizza pan with the handle-type thing they use.  [I wonder at the time if I ordered the individual size I had planned, but assume I had ordered incorrectly.]  She sees that there's no pizza ""stand"" so she leaves with the pizza.  Several minutes pass.  She comes back with the stand and the pizza.  I ask her for a plate.  Several minutes go by and still no plate.  Now our waiter stops by and says ""this isn't your pizza"".  Then he goes off to serve another table.  So I have a pizza that's apparently not mine and still no plate.  Finally the waiter comes back to say that they ran out of small pans so they upgraded my pizza for free.  I now ask him for a plate, which he brings after several more minutes.  So I finally have a plate to go with my now-lukewarm pizza.  It's pretty tasteless anyway, but I can't take a chance on ordering something else for fear of how long it will take. In the meantime, I've finished my iced tea and would like a refill.  Our waiter isn't around and no one else is paying attention.  I go as far as to hold my glass up, somewhat out of the table & into the aisle, in the hopes that someone who works there will see.  Several servers swerve to avoid my empty glass. My son ordered a cookie for dessert - the pizookie thing without the ice cream.  The waiter sets in front of him and the next thing my son is crying because he burnt his hands on the pan.  I rush him to the bathroom to run cold water on his hands, but the water is quite warm.  Normally I would enjoy this temperature, but of course it doesn't help me for a burn. We return to the table so my son can put his hand on the drink glass with ice in it.   The waiter comes by and I tell him that he really needs to tell kids that the pan is hot.  He says he did say that.  I don't recall hearing him, but even if he did it's clear my son hadn't paid attention. The manager comes over, very apologetic.  He comps our pizza and dessert.  So at least we didn't spend a lot of money...  During our visit, I saw managers visiting other tables too so perhaps they had an off nite?  Anyway, we were just visiting Richmond so wouldn't have much opportunity to visit BJ's again.  But I think I'd be more likely to go to another basic chain (TGIFridays, Red Robin, etc.) instead of BJs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico?start=120

The beer is impeccable. Really good. Also, our wonderful server introduced me to the idea of putting a few drops of tobasco into a fireball shot. Don't knock it until you try it. This place is so great, my only complaint is that there isn't any outside dining areas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico?start=120

Kevern S.,"Herndon, VA",0,2,,3.0,6/18/2016,"BJ's was moderately busy in a Saturday night; we were a party of five so seating time was a few minutes as supply is limited. We looked at menus and were pretty decided upon seating. Soda and waters to drink and a quick fried artichoke appetizer. The drinks and app came and we quickly decided that the oil was dirty, as well as the dish having a few fries, Brussels sprout leaves and a tortilla chip included. It went back; nothing but graciousness from the server with an offer from a management visit. The soup, chicken tortilla, was brought, with a table side pour presentation. Hotter soup would have been better, but it was tasty. Cafe Rio is superior, for what that's worth. The table ordered two enlightened dishes, a kids burger, French dip, and sirloin. The Mahi and shrimp came out as a Jambalaya and was also returned. The penne shrimp and asparagus was tasty enough, the Mahi and shrimp was delivered; meager on the couscous and the Mahi a bit firm on the cooked side. Ok, it was dry and kind of flavorless. The shrimp had no real flair either. The spinach was more in the volume of maybe... 4 leaves worth... Further consideration led me to conclude the Mahi sauce was heavily salted. The bread for the French dip was soggy before it was even dipped.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico?start=140

Octoberfest-skip, Pumpkin-tasty and reminded me of the fireballs we used to eat as a kid. Sample size was plenty, not sure I could drink a whole glass. IPA and Red-spot on for style, but not spectacular. The porter and stout-very solid, enjoyed the porter just a little more, Nutty Brewnette (Brown)- my favorite of the meal.

The pizza wasn't bad but the extreme pepperoni was anything but with very little cheese, very little sauce, & very few toppings. I expected a better pie than a typical pizza place since it was something the restauratant was known for.

One of my friends ordered a soup with her entree & we all order entrees. My friend received her soup & that was it - none of us received any entrees. We were told the systems in the kitchen went down but our food would be out shortly regardless. THEN we were told that they were waiting to cook my friend's wings & that they would be out ""in 2 min."" After much more than 2 min (and 1 hr & 40 min of being there total) we asked for a manager. The manager brought out the wings as if that would make everything okay. She said that she was told that we had already eaten & were simply waiting for my friends wings! My poor friends & I worked all day & none of us had eaten so we were really looking forward to this meal. The manager brought us all comp cards (as if we'll ever go back) & did not make us pay for anything (what would we have paid for in the first place? No food & one soup?) we were not the only customers that left or asked for a manager either.

Celeena S.,"Glen Allen, Richmond, VA",6,61,211,2.0,6/12/2017,"The times were much better when the place first opened. These last two times I had came for lunch and I was disappointed. I ordered the chicken tenders and fries and the quality was not great .  The fries were soggy/oily and the tenders just..dry and looked sad. The food also took it's time coming out and for such a basic dish(30 mins or so) and non -busy day , I was surprised. The second time for lunch, there were perhaps 12 tables of 2-4 guests and I felt terrible for our waitress. It seemed she was the only one covering all the tables. She was polite and sweet but this puts a strain on her and the timeliness of the service. On the second visit, I opted for the unlimited soup and salad which seems to maintain it's taste and deliciousness. I also really like there daily specials from mom through Thursdays.  Overall, I believe the main factors of what made this a 2 star was the quality of wait staff and the questionable quality of the dishes I've had. In addition to that, waiting for the check took a solid 15 minutes. Our waiter was very busy but was clearing empty tables before handing us the check... At this point, i just wanted to leave and find anyone to just pay my bill.  (What bugged me most was that I believed there was some form of a work meeting occurring in the dining space behind me. Although I do not know the content of this meeting or anything at all about it, I don't believe it was fair for it to occur while the staff struggles. I believe it demonstrates poor acknowledgement/consideration for staff) There was only one other worker the entire time who seemed to be the spirit of the place for that afternoon as she greeted people kindly and offered her presence to customers that helped out my waiter.  Nevertheless, I recommend trying this place out already once for the food but I do hope the help improves.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico

Timmy T.,"Virginia Beach, VA",272,559,,3.0,10/3/2016,"I wanted to eat a new place in the Short Pump area and my friend recommended this place. He stated he has been numerous times and has only had good experiences so I wanted to give this place a try.  As the name suggests, it's both a restaurant and a craft brew house. The restaurant itself is fairly large and is split into two different dining areas, one for the bar/smaller tables and the other side for bigger parties/families. The menu here is way too extensive. I understand that having all inclusive menu reaches a wider audience and attracts more business but some times I feel that is counter productive. The long menu made it very difficult for me to choose something I wanted. It also doesn't allow the restaurant to focus on several small specialty dishes and execute them exceedingly well instead of just average. I finally decided on the spaghetti and meatballs and my friend got the steak and fries. The food came out in about 10 minutes. The size of my entrée could definitely feed two people and I actually took half home. The pasta itself was okay but nothing great and the same could be said for the meatballs. I liked my dish but there wasn't anything special about it. The pizza looked really delicious from the pictures on the menu and I would probably get that the next time I come (if I do).  Our server was nice and attentive. Although we may have gotten a less than desirable reaction when we asked her what our total was since we had a 10$ off coupon in you spend $35 or more. She didn't even address what we just said and just kind of took off with a look like oh one of those patrons trying to see if they can get something free by using that coupon.

There was confusion with our check and we never did get to eat our dessert because we were running so late. This place has so much potential but never lives up to it & the management is not tuned in. Nobody noticed that while we were waiting for a check a party of six came and sat down where ignored and were very unhappy (same waitress).  I think we are done!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico
Theresa M.,"Richmond, VA",4,8,,1.0,9/18/2017,Went for the first time for dessert. The restaurant was almost empty and the hostess told us it would be a 5-10 minute wait for a table. Once we got a table it took the server 20 mins to get to the table. We ordered water and dessert. The water came 15-20 minutes later with the water. I couldn't understand what was taking so long to get water. While waiting I did see a lot of workers standing around the bar talking. We only ordered dessert and that seemed to take forever. We spend 1.5 hours in the restaurant and only went in for dessert.  That was the first and last time I'll step foot in that place. Seems like the staff could care less about the customers.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico
Becky N.,"Henrico, VA",50,67,85,1.0,4/25/2017,"Let me first say, I have been to this restaurant since they opened. I have seen it really good and watch it go down hill in the short time BJ's has been open. I also don't like giving poor ratings, but when I'm birthday lunch is ruined...I think it is well deserved! My co-worker and I both ordered our lunches via their website/app. We couldn't pay online, which was weird but we just walked over (literally the restaurant is in the next parking lot behind my office) to pick up our lunch. She actually headed over about 10 minutes before I did and hadn't returned which was very odd. When I walked in, she was still waiting and so was another lady who had come in before me. So apparently, their sites were down and orders weren't coming through to the check out system but according to management the kitchen had them and were making our orders. We quickly realized that was a lie. We heard the manager ask about my coworker's order and they clearly responded with ""I don't have a ticket for that!"" So she waited another 15 minutes for her order. They gave her her meal for free which I thought was acceptable.  As I waited, I had to verify with the server that my order was being made. He told me it was but wanted to make sure it was entered correctly so I told him I ordered the Santa Fe chicken salad with balsamic dressing instead of the ranch it came with. And I waited....and waited...and waited. So my food was finally brought out to me and the same server who was at the register when I walked in, the who who verified my order and reentered it in the computer, had the nerve to ask me to pay for this meal!!! I had order before noon and the food was not ready until after 1230pm.i had been waiting over 20 minutes in the restaurant alone! Are you flipping kidding me!?!?!? I laughed and clearly stated I was not going to pay. The manager heard me and was at the ready to respond but I cut him off. Oh...side note if you missed it...this was my birthday...my actual birthday. And I was wearing a sash that said I was a birthday princess!!! So my statement to the manager was simple...I understand there was a technical problem with your website, I can sympathize, but I had a salad and waited over 20 minutes for them to make this salad after I walked in the door. It's my birthday and I'm not paying for something that isn't my fault and I was inconvenienced. He didn't argue, and I didn't pay.  Now for the cherry on my birthday cake... As I'm walking back to the office, face red from the irritating encounter, I notice my salad doesn't look quite right. I sit down at the lunch table in my break room and am ready to flip my lid! I have a salad with no chicken, no corn salsa and no corn tortilla chips! And you all had the nerve to ask me to pay $15 for this!! I guess I would have had to wait another 20 minutes for the chicken. I called and the main manager on duty has given me a credit for another meal but I don't think I want to chance another visit here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico
Trey N.,"Richmond, VA",139,49,137,2.0,4/20/2017,"The two star rating is solely for the excellently made pizza.  I had not been here in a couple years because the food had slid downhill so much, I decided not to come anymore, however the deep dish extreme pepperoni pizza was awesome.  I grabbed the size just above the smallest they had, which after tip ended up being $20!  To me, that price is outrageous for basically a slightly larger than a personal size pizza.  I don't remember paying nearly that much a few years ago.  The waitress was very kind and polite, however, the service she offered was not what I would consider adequate.  It was still lunch time, and there were not many people sitting down to eat.  My second drink refill came after I finished eating, kind of needed that ten minutes before, but the waitress had not come around since my pizza was brought to me except to place the check on the table, completely forgetting my water.  I can say that the food I received was good, and possibly I may order to-go, but considering the expense for the little I got and the lack of service, I won't be coming back anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico

Laura S.,"Harrison, TN",47,227,130,4.0,9/13/2016,We aren't big on chains but BJs is the exception We know we will have good solid food and beer    If it's lunch time and we can't find a local brewery with food we look for a BJs   May not seem like a big deal but for work we are on the road traveling  150+ days a year. So we try to find good and unusual spot but sometimes we just want consistent  Flatbread is good   Lunch special is nice  Thalia was out bartender and gave good service   Bonus for the non beer drinker they have great wine and cocktails  Update your electronic board.  No ginger IPA :( on draft but you are still advertising it  Upgrade to real salt and pepper grinders as well  All in all a good but not fab spot,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico
Karoline B.,"Henrico, VA",68,21,,2.0,4/12/2015,"My boyfriend and I have been here several times and have had only one good experience and 3 bad ones. I loved the lemon thyme chicken the first time we came. The sauce was delicious. However the next two times I ordered it they left off the sauce and I tried waiting for it but my boyfriend finished eating before I got it both times.     One of the visits my Togo order was ordered wrong and 40 minutes after I initially ordered them, I finally received my potato skins with the tiny bit of cheese on them burnt off. I had to retop them at home for my brother. Their curbside stops at like 9 I think, though they didn't bother to tell me that when I ordered. They took my car details and everything.     And to top it off, in all of these visits I have never had a table visit by a manager. Not for one of the mistakes nor a general stop and check. It has the bones of a decent place if they could get the consistency in place. Unfortunately they won't be getting my money for quite a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico?start=160

Doug M.,"Glen Allen, VA",0,21,,1.0,5/25/2015,"My wife, son and I visited BJ's Brewhouse two weeks ago for dinner. It was not very busy at all and we were seated right away. We have eaten at this location previously and have always had a three - four star experience. Unfortunately, this time was a complete disaster. App arrived well after meal was received and the meals were inedible. We insisted on paying for our drinks, but left without eating any food. Manager did take care of the bill, which was appropriate considering nothing was edible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico?start=160

Went there last night , not busy , was offering 1/2 price wine,  ran out of wine glasses so I drank my 6 oz wine out of a 20 oz beer glass. . Why offer  1/2 price wine and not have enough wine glasses!!! Why would you market something and not be prepared for the marketing to work.!!! My last two visits were good so I brought my boss and co workers for a holiday celebration . I won't be back in fact tonight I went to Longhorn because I was embarrassed about last night .

Brian C.,"Glen Allen, VA",49,5,4,1.0,2/6/2015,Don't waste your hard earned dollars going here.  Coolest part is pre-ordering and telling them when you are showing up.  Food was terrible.  Shrimp lettuce wraps had wilted lettuce and cold inners.  They got my order wrong even though I pre-ordered and the pita chicken tacos tasted like bad fish with a horrible sauce.  I asked for the side order they didn't include and they brought it and then tried charging me.  The beers are average at best and don't hold a candle to Rock Bottom Brewery beers.  Go somewhere else!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico?start=160
Jodie B.,"Richmond, VA",0,2,,1.0,11/11/2015,Well let's hope the food wins us over because the service sure hasnt.  Took 15 mins to get my tea. Almost 20 mins for my husbands beer.  The calamari was just ok. Didn't come out hot and it was over fried. Dinner - I ordered fried chicken without the gravy  and my husband order chicken Barbados with black beans and rice. Apparently my chicken was prepared with gravy and needed tonbe re-prepared but during that tume my husband's dish sat under the heat lamp and when the food arrived the beans on his plate were dried out and unedible - definite heat lamp fatality. We called the manager and asked for the check for what we ate but didnt want the dinner. He said there were computer problems last night. Well that would account for the extremely long waits but not the quality of the food. - obviously there is no quality control at this restaurant.  The manager did cover the entire check which was appreciated but I doubt we will make the trek to Short Pump again for this particular restaurant.  It's a shame because the food on the website did look tasty.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico?start=160
Naveen C.,"Henrico, VA",16,3,,1.0,7/19/2015,"We had horrible dining experience here ,We never experienced this kind of  rude receiving from  a waitress ,her name is Mariya.We 4 people went for Bjs today at 7 pm that is 07/19/2015.We were showed our seating from the reception staff,it was fine till there,then this waitress Mariya comes and showing so much attitude.She was rude ,arrogant ,impolite,mannerless and need so much training in customer service.Because we mentioned about her rude behavior with manager she was angry and threw bill on our table,I have never seen in my entire life this kind of insulting behavior from a waitress then other manager comes and says he will talk to her ,I doubt about  his abilities as well,when I was explaining he didn t show any concern he just has to listen so he listened ,thats all.for chain restaurants like this they should train their employees how to behave with customers.I will give 0 starts for their customer service and I will never go this place and I ll share my experience with my friends also.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico?start=160
Lauren K.,"Maidens, VA",0,5,1,3.0,12/14/2014,"Went on a Sunday night after dinner service, just to catch the late game and some drinks and apps. Bartender was  attentive, advised us of specials, and drinks and food were received in a timely manner. On a whim, we decided to get coffee drinks and dessert, a rarity to us. The coffee drinks were made specifically, and while we drank them we patiently waited on dessert. Dessert never came, we asked about it, the order hadn't been placed, and it was rushed to us, placed in front of us, then we expressed that we had expected to enjoy it with our after dinner drinks. Dessert was promptly taken away from us and removed from the bill with an apology, and nothing else. Being familiar with the industry, guest satisfaction is a first, and to ensure return visit, management should have provided dessert or at least made a visit to apologize about the lengthy wait. The bartender was fantastic, but the management have acknowledged the experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-henrico?start=160
