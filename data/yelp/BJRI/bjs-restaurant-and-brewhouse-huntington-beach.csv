Trini T.,"Irvine, CA",1,20,2,5.0,10/26/2017,"Lunch time at this location is so entertaining. Plus you ca get filled up on the lunch menu items (until 3pm). Dana, the ""short, hairy, bald, fat man"" is a great singer. Oh, he pretty good at taking your orders & bringing out the bread.   I got the Shrimp Fra Diavolo & it was the perfect portion, right amount of spicy, & a whole lotta yum!!!  Definitely recommend coming here during the weekday & lunch time to meet Dana. I guess you could get a bit to eat as well.  ciao!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach
Alan C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/8/2018,"i'm usually the type of person who'll eat his entire meal in misery rather than bother the waiter, but even i had to send this pure salt burger back in fear for my life.  also no apology.  also our drinks weren't good.  also the host lied saying it was happy hour so we paid full price. here's a haiku tho! burger caked in salt i'd rather live in my tub and eat hard-boiled eggs",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach
Annie N.,"Los Angeles, CA",59,18,6,1.0,1/8/2018,"Came here after seeing a movie. Haven't been to bjs in probably 8 yrs. Upon walking in, the host told us it was happy hour and sat us in the bar. We ordered a margarita, beer, avocado eggrolls, brew house burger, and roasted cauliflower. The margarita was really sweet. The cauliflower was covered in sauce and soggy. Eggrolls were undercooked and salty. The burger was EXTREMELY salty. Sent back the burger and there server took it off the bill. Came back with the check and all the items were FULL PRICE. It wasn't worth dealing with anymore, gave server FULL tip, and left. NEVER. AGAIN.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach
Natalie G.,"Los Angeles, CA",459,119,89,3.0,12/5/2017,"BJ's has so many great options and their food is absolutely delicious! This review is regarding their takeout option. I ordered large pazooki for my sister's birthday to be picked up.  The order was done on time and the box was warm. When we tried to cut the pazooki and the pazooki was stuck to the foil under it. My friend who works in a restaurant said that she thinks that they forgot to take the foil out and just put it in the box. It was a little embarrassing because we invited friends over the cookie was a bit of a disaster. We had to flip the cookie over so we could tear the foil off of it. Pazookis are GREAT when you eat in the restaurant. The food is usually good, but this particular take out experience was negative.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach
Mercedes H.,"Fountain Valley, CA",387,101,533,4.0,9/7/2017,"Have been coming here often for their happy hour! I always have a pleasant experience when dining here, from the wonderful service to the delicious food! The workers are always on their A game with their customer service. Probably the reason why I always come back. The food always comes out super fast! FOOD: Avocado Eggrolls- 5/5: OMG I HAVE to order this when dining here! I'm not a super big fan of avocado but this appetizer is soo yummy! And the sauce it comes with it makes it that much better.  Calamari- 4/5: Love how its not calamari rings but the whole body cut into pieces. Also barely has an batter on it. That's how calamari should be! Portobello mushroom burger- 3/5: Ehhh I love portobello mushroom burgers but the way they cut the mushroom was humongous! The actual mushroom was bigger than the patty.. I took a few bites and I wasn't enjoying it so I had to take it out.  They have a good list of items for happy hour!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach
Steffanie V.,"Santa Ana, CA",318,119,467,4.0,8/31/2017,"I enjoy coming to BJs for happy hour it's the closest restaurant to home & whenever I need to get my clam chowder craving in this is the place I always end up at .  Love BJs happy hour, appetizers & beer till midnight ? Why not ! I had came back yesterday and it was extremely packed on a Wednesday night. My friends and I were seated right behind the host since there were no more seats where the happy hour section is. I then asked our waitress if they would still honor happy hour since I came with a party of 8 and they did honor it. We got started with the avocado roll and calamari & I had put in my order for beer . I then decided I was really craving for pasta so I had ordered a grilled chicken fettuccine alfredo pasta.  For a party of 8 our food appeared quickly I was very surprised & so glad since I was starting to get hangry haha . I wished the pasta was more cheesier but not gonna lie it was pretty decent and I sure did devour it . My friends had then order desserts so we ended our night with pizzooki! BJs recently started this churro pizzooki which I was really looking forward to but was a bit disappointed because the churro didn't taste good. The churro yesterday night was missing the cinnamon and sugar it was also too soft for a churro, hopefully they fix that can't wait to try it again !  If anyone is wondering happy hour at night time is 10-12 also I'm pretty sure I'll be returning relatively  soon . Can't ever say no to BJs happy hour",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach
Earl S.,"La Habra, CA",31,26,30,5.0,1/11/2018,Came here for a few brews and an appetizer. Great location. Friendly staff and attentive bartenders.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach
Cathy M.,"Anaheim, CA",280,1133,1081,3.0,7/12/2017,"Came here last night for their Tuesday half off wine special, which is a great deal! Parking here isn't too difficult after 8pm. There's plenty of seating inside, but my friends and I chose bar seating instead of restaurant seating. They had a 3 for $12 Trio which is a preview of their new and healthier items. We thought we might give it a try. Here's what we ordered: Garlic Knots - These were okay, I personally think I make better garlic knots. It was incredibly dry and lacked any amount of garlic. Eat them while they're still hot, otherwise you're stuck with cardboard. Mac & Cheese Couscous - This was the only decent thing out of the entire trio. The texture of the couscous blended well with the cheese. I definitely enjoyed this dish, I also liked that it was extra baked, so the cheese on top was nice and crispy. Sautéed Spinach & Kale - This was tasteless. It was just onions; some tomatoes, spinach and kale tossed into a little bowl and heated up. There was no taste to it; definitely the worst thing we ordered. **Final verdict for the 3 for $12 trio: I wouldn't try the trio again; I think I would much prefer their actual appetizers over this.** French Fries - This came from their normal appetizers. The fries are no longer thin and seasoned. Now they're just steak cut, salted, and deep fried. You need to eat this with ketchup; otherwise it won't taste like anything. Mashed Potatoes - We ordered this to share. My friend was craving mashed potatoes, and this wasn't so bad. I probably wouldn't eat it alone, but would prefer it as a side with my entrée. Pepperoni Deep Dish Pizza -  1/2 off during HH after 10pm. This was pretty good. It came out piping hot, and I liked how the pepperoni was cut into thin strips so it was extra crispy. The pizza was definitely tiny; you can eat an entire one alone if you didn't eat anything else. I would probably get this again during their HH next time because I really enjoyed it. Estancia Cabernet Sauvignon - Generally sold for about $36 a bottle at BJ's, we were able to get it for $18 for their  1/2 off Tuesday deal. Not bad, it was enough for 3 of us to share. I would recommend this Cabernet, it smells amazing and doesn't taste overly bitter like other Cabernets I've had. Overall experience here wasn't the best. The service was extremely slow; we had to flag down our server several times to get him to bring extra condiments or utensils. However, he was very accommodating despite the slow service. The food took about 20 minutes to get to us, so I recommend ordering right when you get the chance. Nonetheless, I probably wouldn't be back unless if it's their wine deal or lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach
Timothy W.,"Huntington Beach, CA",5,68,25,1.0,7/3/2017,"BJ's is a chain that you can find pretty much anywhere. I've been to several and this particular location several times, but really never have had a great experience with any one.  Their menu is fairly extensive, but that's not necessarily a good thing. Their food, I would describe, as average at best. The consistency is also very poor. At a different location in Nevada, I ordered the same dish several different times. Each time, it was different. Once, the pasta dish, which is supposed to be hot, came out stone cold.  A friend of mine once found glass in his pasta dish at a different BJ's location. But I'll talk about this location.  It's your standard BJ's layout, but it's busy. During peak times, expect to wait 30+ minutes for a table for two.  Our most recent time here, as soon as we sat down and unrolled our utensils, we found both sets to be dirty. Not just a little dirty, but with large pieces of baked-on food. Both mine and my girlfriend's were soiled. We asked for replacement sets and those were also soiled just the same. Disgusting!  We specifically ordered food that didn't need utensils to eat.  The female server, Kayla, repeatedly called me ""hun"" with my girlfriend sitting right across from me. I find that rude and unprofessional.  In the bathrooms, there was no toilet paper or seat covers in the female restrooms.  The beer? I wouldn't bother. If you appreciate good beer, order something from their craft brew menu, not their in-house selections.  My girlfriend ordered sweet potato fries with her sandwich, but was given regular fries and had to send it back.  We will not be coming back to BJ's, not this location or any other.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach
Tracey N.,"Arcadia, CA",313,103,184,3.0,11/25/2017,"Every time I come here, we usually get a table within 10 minutes.  There is plenty of parking spaces around the restaurant. The service here is quick and friendly.  It's pretty big with indoor and outdoor sittings. The bar area has many big-screen TVs and they usually have sport games on.  However, the food quality here is just mediocre.  Definitely not worth the price they are charging.  They need to put a lot more work into the plate presentation.  This time, I ordered the rib-eye steak with the house salad and mashed potatoes.  The plate came out with a big piece of steak and a scoop of mashed potatoes next to it.  It looked pretty plain! I wish I can say it tastes better than it looks but naa, not really...My friend ordered the fresh Atlantic salmon.  The plate looks yummy but the salmon is greasy with oil. I had the chicken alfredo to-go as well and wasn't so impressed with that either.   It's a nice restaurant but I wish they would improve their food quality because the dishes are so bland.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach

This time we got the regular chocolate chunk, salted caramel, and cookies and cream. SO good!  The restaurant is good too. It is a chain but they have a massive drink list and food menu. They probably have anything you're in the mood for. Nothing out of the ordinary, but every time I've eaten here it's been pretty good food.

Mikaela H.,"Costa Mesa, CA",8,83,85,2.0,6/29/2017,"The stars are really only for our server.  I'm not sure why over all these years I still choose to come here because it's never satisfying. Service is usually dull and slow. Food takes forever and isn't that great.  But I love appetizers and have been a loyal bjs customer for years now.  Service : host and hostess are less than enthusiastic. I don't think the person who sat us even said a word.  Our server John was the best  I've ever had at a bjs. He was friendly and helpful. Any bjs I've ever been to the service is close to useless. Like they just bring the food and that's it. He was very different from this and seemed like a server I've had at any other restaurant with good service. So 5 stars for john !  Food : Stuffed Mushrooms - the reason I come here and today they looked like sad shriveled burnt mushrooms. Super disappointed  Boneless wings with root beer glaze : the glaze was good but the chicken was really dry and not enough glaze..  Prime rib dip: super bland, hardly  any flavor and pretty dry. My boyfriend didn't even finish it and he clears a table. Black and bleu burger : well........ there was an eggshell in my burger... so that's all I have to say about that.  We complained about the egg shell and the manager came over and offered to take it off the bill  but we already had a buy one get one coupon. She then offered us a free desert but we were full so I believe it was gonna be left at that until my boyfriend asked to just take off the burger and let us use the buy one get one on our appetizers so she let us use that. So that was nice. Still after all that we spent 40 dollars on a meal that really wasn't worth 10...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach

John is a great server & he's extremely attentive. He apologized for the food & drinks taking long (although we didn't think it took long, considering how busy the restaurant was) & he kept our drinks full.  Not to mention...I overheard a rude customer complain about his drink being low & although the customer was mean, John kept his cool & respected the customers frustration, dropped everything & immediately had the customers drink refilled.

Philip M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,14,1,1.0,1/6/2018,I came for the Saturday brunch as I normally do and was greeted by a pounding rock music background. I requested they lower it a bit but they didn't. I asked for the manager since I come here all the time and know from experience it was really loud. He came out smirking and said he lowered it in two adjacent rooms but not the one we were in. A true smart (bleep). When he left for the back room the sound was lowered to normal in two seconds. So it could have been done easily before.   I love background music but for some reason this morning the guys working the place wanted it to pound you senseless. Besides this morning manager being a (bleep) I really enjoy the good food and waitresses I know over the years.

Kristine T.,"Westminster, CA",2,10,4,2.0,9/14/2017,"This review is for their delivery service. I highly recommend to NOT use their delivery service. Thursday night dinner basically turned into a midnight snack. I called the restaurant and the person who picked up the phone stated the delivery service typically takes around 30 minutes. It took them over an hour and a half to deliver our order and we live approximately 10 minutes from the restaurant.  When the food finally arrived, it was cold. Cold pizza and cold brussel sprouts. Terrible! Sorry BJ's, but your delivery service is absolutely horrible. Not sure if I would even come back to dine-in at this restaurant anymore. So disappointed.

Upon being seated at our table, there was a tablet we had an option to order from. We attempted and failed.  I mean, we are quite tech savvy and needless to say it was embarassing we couldn't figure it out and luckily a server took our order instead.   Anyway onto the food. We ordered the spinach artichoke dip and a buffalo pizza. Food came out super slow and it wasn't busy at all. When it did finally come out, chips were all broken crumbs like those you'd find at the bottom of a bag of chips. The pizza was mediocre and wasn't even hot. Quality was lacking. Luckily the best part was how easy it was to pay on the tablet and get out.

Lindsay H.,"Santa Monica, CA",365,303,180,2.0,7/12/2015,"It was as if this BJs had just opened today with how off the service was. Our waitress was great, but her visits were inconsistent and there were times where so many other people checking in at our table that we didn't really know if we had a waitress anymore. For whatever reason, they only had one bartender working on a busy Sunday afternoon so drinks took a long time; one was completely forgotten. Then, shortly after appetizers were finished, my salmon quinoa dish came - along with another we definitely didn't order. I sat and waited for the rest of the dishes to come... and waited, and waited... We're thinking they gave me another tables order, because then the rest finally came out all together. And then another salmon quinoa dish was delivered to our table a few minutes later (that one was probably mine, even though it was much later than the others). The first salmon quinoa looked like it had been sitting out under the heating lamp for a bit and the chef skimped on the veggies, so the waitress just gave me the second one as compensation. Once we got our meals, the various wait staff stopped by frequently to check in. Unfortunately our dirty dishes didn't get cleared until we asked. Sooo, I think it's pretty clear that our experience was less than stellar. Like I said, everyone just seemed to be off.

It may not be the best pizza, but  If I am looking for a good inexpensive deep dish this end of the OC, I know BJ's can always deliver.  Pizza is something that the Beast and I always agree on, its got to have a lot of meat, lots of sauce and lots cheese on it. And Anchovies on the side. But lately, I have been more accommodating to his needs and allow half the pizza to have his silly little fishes. And you know what? There is zero fishjuice on my half.  We have also learned to alter their standard pizzas and add extra sauce, extra cheese and order it well done, to ensure its cooked all the way through. Sometimes, with multiple toppings the crust does not always cook to our liking, so that extra few minutes in the oven really helps. A large satisfies us and we can usually finish the whole pie ourselves.  If I we dont share the large pizza I order one of the chicken dishes, The Parmesan chicken and balsamic glazed chicken are amazing, and some of my favorite dishes ever. Washed down with the berry peach iced tea. To finish things off, we usually share the white chocolate macadamia nut Pizzookie with ice cream. Service here is never consistent. Which is why the 3 stars.  It is like a roller coaster, up and down, up and down. It makes me dizzy. Tonight our service started out good. I was actually surprised how good it was. But then our waitress got a little busy, disappeared, missed us waving her down  and forgot our drink refills after removing our cups from our table. Then they changed shifts. So we got a new waitress.  Service was in slow motion, at the end of our meal as we waited for our to go  box and check. Then the new server forgot our coupon. *sigh*. In the end everything was resolved and we left full and satisfied. What I noticed is, the other servers in the same sections do not have each other's backs. They don't seem aware of their fellow servers tables needs or tap off their drinks, remove plates, notify your server the customer needs them, ect. It took a few minutes to get our servers attention and the other servers were completely oblivious.  The kitchen crew on the other hand, seem, to be in sync with everyone. Once they bring your order out, they are quick to bring you any condiments you might need.   I also noticed the other patrons around us were pretty much all needing the same things. Checks, to go boxes, drinks, ect. We all must of sat down around the same time. That also makes it difficult to have excellent service. The tiny tables for 2 are not the greatest if your having pizza. There is not enough room for the pizza, the drinks, and a conversation. Its hard to see the person your talking to, if a pizza is in your face, or your worried the pizza is going to fall off the table. Opt for a bigger table for pizza. 4 star food....3 star service = 3 stars I am a fan of the food, but the service could be better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=100
Andrew M.,"Midway City, CA",0,2,,3.0,5/21/2017,"Let me just say that the upsetting experience I had tonight ended on a good note, thanks to the manager, Daniel. When my family and I got our food, my brother had to wait longer for his chicken alfredo because the staff accidentally dropped it and had to cook another one.     Considering that I have worked in restaurant service before, I simply brushed it off because I understood that that stuff happens sometimes. For the record, I want to say that the food tonight was delicious as always. BJs never fails to amaze me with their dishes. However, what got me upset was that when our server finally brought my brother's food, he was left to eat on his own since the rest of us were just about done. Additionally, when my brother's food arrived, our server did not even bother asking us if we wanted drink refills when most of our glasses were clearly empty. That was the last time we saw our server. We never got our refills and waited a while for our bill.   Thanks to Daniel for being such a great manager and remedying the situation. After expressing my frustration, he personally came over to our table with our bill and apologized for the mishap and service. He told us that he took my brother's chicken alfredo off the bill, and put in another 15% discount to reduce our total. At this moment, I felt valued as a customer and perceived this action on his end as excellent customer service. I expressed my gratitude and told him that I will for sure be coming back soon!

The host was no where to be found which was kind of odd. And when he did come to the table he seemed like he didn't want to be at work.  Anyways so we got seated and the seating was nice! Our servers name was Jose and he was so nice! I really liked his customer service. He spilt the check with no problem and refilled our drinks right away! The food was good and it came at a reasonable time. Not to quick and not too long but just reasonable. I did order the ahi seared salad which was amazing!! I will be getting that again but my mother ordered the buffalo chicken salad and said her greens were wet which was not very appetizing to her.

As a bit of a background:  The reason I had initially left my terrible review was because that time we had went, our pizza had taken an eternity to come out, and it took so long that a manager came out and told us we could have a free appetizer while we waited, so we got the breaded mozzarella sticks, which were (are) fantastic. Then we get our pizza, finish, and get the bill, and the appetizer is on the bill, so we felt cheated. We paid the bill, but left no tip because of it and left with a sour taste in our mouths. However, this time, the food came out relatively quickly (the breaded mozzarella sticks were again fantastic, and the Mediterranean deep dish is PHENOMENAL), and we decided to bring up our last experience to the waitress, and she went to get a manager so we could talk to him about it. We told him everything that happened that last time, and he apologized deeply for it, thanked us for continuing to come to BJ's, and even removed the appetizer from our bill! 5 star service this time more than made up for the experience last time, and I will definitely be coming back again..

My primary complaint though is that in my salsa was a label from either a towel or clothing as it said ""100% cotton"" very clearly. The waiter apologized, took it, and replaced my salsa, but that was it.  We also had a coupon for $10 off of $35, it was a good thing we checked the bill as it was not applied the first time the bill was brought. Good food, but I think some procedures and training may need to be updated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=80

The bread was soggy and the avocado was brown-tinged slime. I had to throw my dinner away.My husband had the Ahi salad, which was fine and clam chowder. The chowder was medium warmth because it was in an insulated cup.

One visit in particular they handed us copies of paper with most allergy information missing :/  This last visit on 1/21/17 the staff was great but the managers were lack luster and set a really low standard for customer service.

You add some delicious gourmet beer (Jeremiah Red) and a pazookie for dessert and you got yourself a hellofa place to eat. Where this place falls short is the wait times. Last time I visited it felt like forever to get our dish, drinks refilled and such. It was shame because it wasn't crowded at all and there really was no need for a delay. Perhaps there was, but we were not informed one way or another from our server or even apologized to that it took so long.

One of the server even took time out of his busy night to scoop pizzas on our plates for us with a big smile on his face! I love the customer service here!

I like this place so much that I actually got their app and boy is it handy; most meals you'd go here for end up giving you plenty of points anyway so it's definitely worth looking into. Not like it costs you anything to get their app anyway. Their pizookie obviously is delicious but I'd really recommend smaller sizes unless you're sharing with a party because they get really tiring and I have a huge sweet tooth. Some honorable mentions: I REALLY enjoyed their pink lemonade, their dry rub wings (lemon pepper), the avocado eggrolls (expensive and small though), the strawberry beignet, their pizza ofc, and practically all of their pizookies (except the gluten free one, never tried that, never will).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=20

Despite the fact that it's an ""A-OK,"" (three of five stars seems rather dismissive, I realize), but it really is the Berry Burst Cider that initiates our return.  The service is what you'd expect: corporate, scripted, standardized.  The pizza's tasty; however, I don't know anyone who's placed BJ's pizza on their favorites list.  But BJ's is a great place to gather with friends after work, to catch up a little, have a drink, and get a quick bite.  (Come to think of it, BJ's would probably consider me a 3 of 5 as well.)  I'm good with that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=20

My boyfriend and I came in around 6pm on a Sunday. Of course it's busy and we understand there's going to be wait. The girl at the front told us it was going to be about 10-15 mins. Okay, no problem. So we are waiting and waiting and it's been about 30 mins and were wondering what the hell is going on. So finally, my boyfriend gets up and goes to see what is taking so long. You guys, the hostess FORGOT to put our name in. So then they tell us it's going to be another 5 mins. Back to waiting. They finally call our name and try to seat us at some tiny ass table against the wall with 50 million kids around. Like a chuckie cheese section of Bjs. Wtf, ummm no. So we finally see a table open by the bar and we take it.  So far, things are good. Our waitress is super nice. We ordered our food: half Mediterranean and half bjs favorite pizza and some chicken wings. Then we get our pizza, and it literally looks like the cooks threw a bunch of shit on there. I said half and half you guys and I got a mixture of every ingredient known to mankind. So I notify the waitress. She was really sweet and agreed it looked like vomit and took it back to the kitchen. Eventually, we got a new pizza made properly, the right way. The only thing good about this night was the waitress. It's too bad I didn't get her name to compliment her service in this review. But everyone else: the cooks and the hostesses, you guys suck at your job. So at the end of all this we ended up spending $50 for a shitty experience at Bjs.

I wasn't too hungry so I just got their spinach artichoke dip which is probably my favorite- it's so rich and creamy and just so delicious!  My friend ordered the chicken alfredo but she said her pasta was a little dry.  For dessert we got the pizookie trio: churro, original, and triple chocolate. I'm a chocolate fan but their triple chocolate is a little overwhelming, it tasted heavily of cacao. The original is my go-to and the churro was soooo good! Can't go wrong with pizookies!

The last time, the server said she would figure out for me to either use the $10 coupon for a $35 purchase or used the happy hour discounts on drinks and apps, I trusted her and found out I was out of about $4 when I got home. The drinks used to be $6 for a mojito, now its only $1 off, which brought the price to $7.50, quite expensive. The pizza was kind of soggy, the crust was not crispy This time we had a really nice chap, his name was Preston, it was an unusual name so no family name was needed when I give him this shout out!. We used the $10 coupon from checking in on Yelp. I had the Jambalaya, it was fresh and flavorful but much too hot, they must have sprinkled 1/2 a bottle of paprika, the next time I will for sure request less paprika. My husband ordered the pasta with shrimp and asparagus, the sauce was phenomenal, the fired grilled taste was just out of this world, we complained the asparagus was too chewy, mostly the stem, we saw no tip, Preston brought me another plate of freshly cooked asparagus with tips, really tender and flavorful, we were totally impressed with Preston's fast service and good customer service manners. Preston also gave us a free pizookie, it was really delicious, my previous experience with pizookie was not as good. BJ mojito was the best in the world, what I had in Little Havana was outrageously priced for a 3rd rate Mojito. The mojitos I had on all my cruises, they were all no good!!!

I went to another restaurant before going to BJ's tonight because it was way too crowded and I could count on BJ's to have a seat for me for late night dinners. We sat at the bar and instantly got greeted by our server Preston! He was a great server, love his enthusiasm and the way he answered my question on what he would recommend. I ended up getting the baked ziti and my friend got the late night burger with skinny fries and clam chowder. Since it was Wednesday, they had $4 BJ's craft beers as their weekday specials. The baked ziti was ok, it came out warm and I wish it was hotter. The beignet is a must get for me every time. Screw the pazookie! They have happy hour after 10pm but its not that great. At the moment it's $2 off appetizers /flat breads, half off mini pizzas and I'm not sure what else, check their website for the full information. Make sure to subscribe to their emails for coupons too! I got $10 off spending $35. My friend forgot to tell the server while I was in the restroom and ended up not using it.

Vu N.,"Houston, TX",131,102,1114,4.0,4/18/2017,"This is really a 3.5 star but my rule of thumb is to estimate up, not down.  The why;  2 star: BJ's is a chain, so the interior is much like all the other BJ's you've encountered unless it's your first time. Very clean, trendy, and commercial feel, it's definitely family friendly and group friendly, depending on your circumstances. The ambiance is very laid back with TV's all around if you're catching the game.  Is it intimate? Depends how close you want to breathe In your date's ear.  1 star: Our server, Jordan, did a good job. He was very informative and recommended a few things that we ended up purchasing. I was trying different beers and he brought me a Sample of a seasonal pilsner which I thought was cool. Attentive enough without over doing it.  1 star: The food is nothing spectacular. But it does get the job done. We ordered the chicken wings with the sauce on the side. Guacamole dip and chips, and the new nacho flatbread pizza. I can't really complain but there was nothing wow about it. But when I'm drinking a beer, anything taste good.  Why not a 5 star review? Because that would mean I stand behind the product. Believe in it. Do I believe in BJ's? It's good for on the fly drinks with a couple of pals while I'm in town on short notice on a late Easter night when all the other restaurants are closed.

If you go on their website, you can get a FREE APPETIZER OR FREE PIZZOOKI if you spend more than $9.95 which is pretty easy to do so don't forget to show your waiter/waitress. Although our waitress forgot to take it off our bill.... We also ordered a chicken bacon ranch pizza and that was good. A small size (6 slices) is big enough for two people because keep in mind it's deep dish, so you'll be full. My boyfriend made the mistake of getting a medium lol (8 slices).  We also got a strawberry lemonade. It took forever to come out because the waitress ""forgot"" about it... No worries though because I will tell you to never ever ever EVER get a strawberry lemonade here. It's seriously full of syrup... Like SUPER SWEET SYRUP. It's so bad... I felt like I was drinking corn syrup. It was SO disgusting. Oh, and our waitress forgot to charge us for it... But no complaints there lol. Seriously though, she forgot basically everything..  Also, if you ask for complimentary bread, they WILL give it to you. I didn't see anyone with it, but if you ask, they would bring it out for you. Strange.  In the end, we only paid $23 for an appetizer, a medium sized deep dish pizza, and a strawberry lemonade lol because basically the appetizer and lemonade were free. That deal online is pretty cool.

Let me give you the run-down on my experience [today]  I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken, and it came with a side of mashed potatoes.  I wanted a full BAKED potato instead, so the waiter, Cory, was kind enough to switch my potatoes to a baked potato instead of mashed.  Okay, first trip of my order:  The sour cream and the butter both were on the side, when I wanted to get all of them ON TOP of the potato like people usually do.  So, they took my plate back, and the chef put the chives, butter, and sour cream on top for me.  Second trip:  I didn't see the pepper gravy on my chicken, so I kindly asked them to put the gravy on top of the chicken.  They put the gravy on top of the chicken.  Yes, I know those are small issues, but I'm sometimes OCD about things like that - again, not to say it's a bad thing, but on the other hand, I'm not Mr. Perfect. :)  All in all, the food (and service) today was at par, so I may try again another day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=60

We had to ask her twice for our drinks, twice for ranch, twice for our check and three times for a to-go box. By the end she was no longer apologizing and said, ""Here"", then left. A good portion of her time was spent flirting with the table next to us. It took us over 2 hours, from the time we got our food, to get our check and leave. We called in a pizza for carry out the following week. All we wanted was a good pizza without the poor service. When we got home, the pizza was wrong and one of the best parts, the tomatoes, weren't even on the pizza and it was so dry. It was missing other toppings as well. Next time we know to check it before we leave. I've truly never had a pizza screwed up for delivery or carry out and didn't think to check it. We should've known. I gave 3 stars because of management. If something isn't right, they make sure it is before you leave (if dining in). It will probably be a long time before we come back, as we have a bad taste in our mouths after these last two incidents.

All throughout our meal she kept constantly checking on us making sure everything was good. Towards the end we decided to try to pay at the table which didn't work out so well but she offered to close our check for us and take off the game purchase we accidentally made.

Then after we finish eating the waiter didn't come over to our table for a while and we were ready to order dessert, once he finally came he didnt ask if we needed anything else he just set the check down and we stopped him to get the dessert we got it and within a couple min. the check was back on the table. they were more in a rush to get paid then they were to serve us.

I called the location again and Kennedy transferred me to her manager.  The guy was helpful too because he sensed my frustration (of course I said that ""I've jumped through all the hoops you wanted me to, but I still can't pay for my food"".  I guess they don't really want curbside or business customers who just want a simple way to buy and pick up food.   They make it so hard to buy their food for a standard, chain restaurant.  I expect super trendy- hard to get in- restaurants to make it difficult  but not a place like this.

Our waiter offered to make a new one as expected, (which took another 15 min) but gave us an attitude as if we were being difficult or something. Then we both felt like he was rushing us to get out of there once our pizza was ready, as he brought it to us boxed up already.

The hostess and host did a great job in greeting and sitting us as efficiently as possible. These hosts do not slack around! You can tell they are constantly scanning and working to make sure guests are seated as soon as possible. I dine at this BJs frequently because of the service! I love the food, especially the Barbecue Chicken pizza, tomato mozzarella salad, chicken alfredo fettuccine, and strawberry lemonade (my usuals). Always end with either a cookies and cream/Oreo or chocolate chunk pizookie! You won't regret it. But why I consistently come back is the amazing and friendly service I always receive. My usual server is Mandukhai, who has such an effortless way about her that makes my dining experience feel comfortable. Mandukhai makes sure all my requests are met with efficiency and certainty. She always goes above and beyond in her service. I can also say the same for Connie and Cory! If you ever get Connie, you will get hit with so much fun and friendliness, it's infectious! Cory gives the best service, as well. He is so quick with every request and so freaking funny! Love this BJs because it's a big corporate restaurant that gives a small restaurant experience with its service.

I don't think so!  I think that's where they hide people who don't look beachy enuf.  I asked her for a booth so she redirected us to the main dining area close to a TV.   Food: The tortilla soup was more like a thick stew. I was disappointed that it wasn't more watery - is that strange?  I also ordered the bruschetta appetizer but it came after I was done with my main course.  The hubby's Cajun chicken pasta was a bit starchy/pasty with a strange taste. Me thinks they threw some cayenne pepper in the pot and labeled it ""Cajun"".  No complaints on the Caesar salad the hubs ate although it appeared to be swimming in dressing.  Service: It started out good enough but soon after we ordered, our waiter was switched out.  The replacement completely forgot about our existence.  My iced tea was never refilled so I started drinking my husband's Pepsi.

Zaynab B.,"Westminster, CA",0,6,4,3.0,5/25/2016,"I've had a lot of mixed experiences at this restaurant. From what I've seen and what my close friends and family have told me, the waiters and waitresses will either make your experience a good one or a very bad one.  On the good days, a waiter will seat us in the appropriate size booth/table, take my order while asking all the right questions, and deliver the food after 25 minutes (which is not bad during their busiest times).  On the bad days, they will seat you in a very cramped location, it will take about 20 minutes for a waiter to even approach you to ask what you're ordering, and over half an hour later the food comes in somewhat cold. I'm not saying I'll never come back to this BJ's, it's one of the few restaurants close to home that feels more appropriate for a nice restaurant dinner than the other places in Bella Terra.

My husband, 2.5 year old daughter & I were sat in the back room, straight through the bar.. Where they usually sit us.. We were sat at a table when there were 2 booths open. Ok.  Every table seemed to have a different server, so we waited patiently.  After both booths were filled, we started getting annoyed that nobody had even greeted JUST OUR TABLE; Making eye contact with each of the other tables servers. After the second booth was sat, a waitress came out took their drink order and went to go get them...  We left. And because my husband is on their rewards program (SUPER FREQUENT CUSTOMERS) the manager was able to call him and offer us to come back... No thanks.  Two weeks ago.. Evelyn was our waitress. (Pretty sure it has an 'i' in it.. Autocorrect)  After my husband ordering a small cheese pizza, and broccoli cheddar bread bowl... I over heard the table of girls behind me complain about how their server got their orders wrong.. Didn't think much of it. Our waitress comes by and gives us our second round of sodas.. And tells us that the kitchen messed up and made him a mini cheese and mine would be out soon. My husband tells her to wait on them and bring them out together. To which she returns to our table with this mini cheese pizza and me, nothing.. She comes back 10 minutes later and asks if everything was ok. So I gesture to my empty table and say 'um no not really', her response is 'it's coming soon' . She returns a minute later and has a young gentleman tell me he will be taking over our table because she has to go home. I'm not kidding when I tell you red hot steam had to have come from my ears when the food runner set down A SECOND PIZZA on our table, because the manager came over.  TWO PIZZAS BEFORE ONE SOUP?!  What is wrong with this picture?!  All the manager has to say is the generic 'sorry'..'it's on the house'  What is?! HIS dinner? Yea thanks!  Meanwhile the manager asks if I want to take the soup home with me.. Um no thanks. I wanted to eat dinner with my family.  Next thing I know our waitress is asking her next table what they want to drink.  Ps. The pizza that night was bogus. BOTH of them! Nothing but bread. Hardly any sauce and even less cheese.  Oh and I witnessed her trying to bring us a check as we were getting up.. The manager motioned with his hands back n forth across his neck with eyes open real wide.  We won't be back here.

I don't think the food has gone down hill, I just think I've been enlightened by many delicious foods so now BJ's is mediocre. It sure does the job though. We ordered potato skins, BBQ Chicken Pizza and a chocolate chip pizookie. Potato Skins These potato skins are fried then adorned with cheese, bacon bits, and chives. Very tasty but the potatoes themselves could use some work. They were dry and hard.  BBQ Chicken Pizza Again, I used to LOVE BJ's but I found my recent trip to be overwhelmingly underwhelming. The pizza crust was soggy, the bbq sauce tasted artificial and the chicken tasted frozen. I was very unsatisfied with this pizza. Pizookie The pizookie was perfect!! It's a warm, soft and gooey freshly baked chocolate chip cookie topped with vanilla ice cream. Scrumdiddlyumptious! Our waiter was not anything out of the ordinary. It was a day before my sister's birthday so I asked her if she could bring a surprise pizookie to the table while my sister was in the bathroom. I guess homegirl forgot and asked us if we wanted dessert after we were done with our meals. Super awkward because I tried to lowkey remind our waiter that I had already asked her to bring us a surprise pizookie. Our waiter couldn't pick up my hints so I had to blow the surprise and remind her in front of my sister. Annoying but whatever  Meh, I'll probably be back but NOT when I'm expecting a quality meal.

Tracie L.,"Orange County, CA",1055,631,3147,3.0,6/20/2013,"Came here for Father's day w/ the fam bam, thank god their call-in reservation system worked otherwise we would have had to wait for hours. So sadly enough it was our family's first time ever trying BJ's, my dad wanted to go 'cause of the free Father's day pint glass & I guess there was a dish he liked in the mail-home flyer ad they sent. Our waiter seemed frustrated the whole night by giving us service w/ an attitude, that was a no-no for me especially on father's day. However, I give him props for getting all the modifications correct for our food. Started off w/ the thai shrimp lettuce wrap appetizer. HIGHLY recommend you start w/ this to open your stomach. It's very light and refreshing, the shrimp was not overcooked which is a plus. The sauce complemented well w/ the mango salsa in the lettuce cups. There were plenty of shrimp pieces as well (I think about 3 per lettuce cup)  Maui Glazed Porkchop - I've been on a pork chop crave and so I decided to get this. I should have figured that since it was on the under 575 cal menu it would be a small portion -__- It was ONE pork chop, instead of potatoes I subbed for steamed veggies. The veggies were perfectly steamed not too mushy and not salty. The pork chop could have used some work. Didn't really get much flavor from it and it was really small. I should have just ordered the regular 2 pork chops one BBQ Chicken Pizza - Mom ordered this dish since I told her per reviews the pizzas are bomb. However, mom was highly disappointed. There were a good amount of chicken chunks on the pizza which I liked 'cause I hate skimpy toppings, but according to my mom she liked Papa John's better =\ The pizza was also cold when it arrived Salmon Terriyaki - my sis ordered this dish, I have to say this was probably the best dish out of everything we ordered (wait nvm the shrimp lettuce wrap was). It was actually pretty expensive for this dish (about 17$) but I think the only reason it tasted good was cause it was drenched in terriyaki sauce. It was definitely a big portion, but most of it was rice... Chicken fettucini Alfredo - My baby sis ordered this and well she has the taste bud of a 13 year old so she said it was good, but the dish looked bland compared to Cheesecake Factory. The chicken breast was so small...HOWEVER the garlic butter bred that came w/ the dish was AMAZING! Everyone devoured the bread. It was really soft and warm Mahi Mahi w/ Scallops - Alright Star of the show, DAD ordered this dish. I think it's a great combo deal (bout $16), and on the ad it looked really good BUT when the dish arrived it looked nothing like the ad (go figure). The mahi was so small like literally my fist size and so were the scallops. The mahi was definitely over cooked, but the scallops were good. My poor dad was disappointed in his dish and just picked off the Salmon Terriyaki plate instead. CHOC CHIP PIZOOKIE - Ok we HAD to get this dish. It's amazing it took this long before I tried the pizookie since my friends always rave about it. It was SOOOOOOO good. Warm ooey gooey choc chip baked w/ scoops of vanilla ice cream. Everyone loved this dessert. I shoulda got the trio to sample the other flavors. So to summarize it up, I probably would only go here for the pizookie or if I'm seriously watching my portion control on food. Otherwise I'd stick to cheesecake factory 'cause I'm a girl w/ a big appetite",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=200

My go to plates were the chicken lettuce wraps and the chicken alfredo. Sadly the food creativity and craftsmanship has downgraded. The meals no longer look complete. The lettuce wraps contain chicken that look like slices of grilled chicken breast thrown into a bowl rather then being sautéed with the sauce.

I really recommend their Jeremiah Red Ale for anyone getting into beers. It's crisp and light with enough body but not too overwhelming for beginners. Hefes are always nice too if you're into lighter drinks. Aside from those, if you want to try other things, their pastas and pizookies.  Finding close parking might be hard on game nights but it shouldn't be hard to find a parking. I never really had a bad service so I can't complain there. I would give a 4.5 since it can be pretty expensive for what it is. Overall, I find that this is a great place to kick it with friends when you're indecisive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=200
Jennifer S.,"Portland, OR",666,562,1974,2.0,9/12/2014,"What has happened to you, BJs? You were once my ""generic, go to"" place if we couldn't decide what we wanted, because you kind of have a little bit of everything (like the Cheesecake Factory)... and I've always been satisfied with the food and the service. But lately, you always disappoint me with one or the other. Today, it was the service. - - - Upon getting inside, my friend and I stood there. Waiting... A group of ladies walked in right before us, but they were greeted. We weren't for about five minutes, and when she did talk to us, it wasn't a greeting. It was a... ""How many?"" The whole, entire time before she just played on the little computer seating chart and made herself look busy. Oh, and I completely understand that my baby was a bit on the loud, crying side, but if you sat us in a more efficient manner, I would be able to give him a bottle... and OMG! The loud, crying noise would disappear! - - - Once sat, we didn't see our server for forever. She was nice, so I'll give an extra star... but the service was unfortunately slow. Did they not expect it to be busy on a Friday? I don't know. All I know is that everything seemed to take a long time.  - - - Now, don't get me started on this food runner girl... Ooohhh! She'd seriously like throw plates at you if she could. She must have been in a bad mood, because she'd come by with the food, say what it was in the most annoyed voice ever, and drop the plate in front of you. SO rude. - - - I had never visited this location before, and I don't know if I will again.

We didn't even get an apology for waiting so long from the man that took our food order. Then my boyfriend's food (with cold mashed potatoes) came out along with the appetizer and my entree didn't come out for another 15 minutes after. Again, no apology. No two bite check, we were completely ignored until our card was out to pay. We'd like to think we are regular customers who treat those in the service industry with generous tips for how hard they work. Last night, I didn't see any hustle.

I have come to this BJs for a while now and I have always had decent to great service! Until tonight.  We had ordered around 10:00PM and for 30 minuets still had gotten our food. Thinking BJs is just busy, so we gave our waitress a little more time. 15 more minuets and we finally had asked when our food would be coming out. Our waitress then apologized and told us she FORGOT to put in our order!!! It took her a full 45 minuets to realize she had forgotten? Ridiculous. Then, she offered us a soup or salad ""on her"". Politely declining, just wanting our main course. 15 more minuets pass and now we have been waiting 1 hour for our dinner!!! It had FINALLY came out after an hour.  Dessert time. Thinking... ""Let's order early so this doesn't take forever"" we ordered two pazookies, 1 regular sized pazookie, which we had asked our waitress about because it was said to be ""free pazookie day"" (with a purchase of a meal) and 1 mini pazookie. Right after we had ordered dessert our waitress gave us the check. On the check was our two entrees and 2 full price pazookies. WRONG. So I flagged down the waitress and readdressed the free pazookie deal. Took 10 minuets to get the correct bill and 20 total minuets to receive our dessert.

The meal was almost $30 for wings and pasta, which is a stretching for us. I chose to get the shrimp and asparagus pasta: it was decent. There wasn't much flavor in the dish, and it was a very small dish for $16. The buffalo wings will always be my boyfriends favorite. They drizzle their buffalo sauce and ranch on top instead of pouring the sauce over, so the wings stay crunchy. Yum!

We had a reservation for 8 people @ 5:30pm for our friend's 21st birthday and our entire party showed up around 6. Our waiter was very nice, got our drink order & food order and all was well. Drinks lagged a bit, and he comes over to me and asks what I ordered again (not a good sign). I tell him I ordered the same as my friend next to me, which were mahi mahi tacos (no cilantro), and he went on his way.   15 or so minutes later our table starts getting their food, which was everyone but myself and my friend who ordered the tacos. Our waiter says they're lagging but it'll be out as soon as possible. A few mins pass and he brings out my friend's plate, and explains there was a ""mix up"" in the kitchen with my order and it'll take a bit longer. (Even though we ordered the same damn thing, which means he clearly didn't put in my order). Everyone at my table was then eating except for me, and I probably sat there for 30+ minutes with no food. All the meanwhile the waiter constantly comes over and apologizes, which was appreciated but it wouldn't change the fact I didn't have any food the entire night and I honestly ended up being there to hang out LMAO.    I was insanely irritated the entire time but tried not to take it out on him and I remained patient. He ended up telling me the meal would be discounted and he would put it in a to-go box for me.

Like yeah, it ended up being free, but I would have rather gotten what I ordered (on time) and paid for it than to be pissed off and hungry all night with something I waited for for over an hour and it didn't even end up being right.

Christine V.,"Laguna Hills, CA",194,232,492,4.0,11/23/2014,"My experience at this BJs has been alright, I have been here twice and usually go to the Downey or Cerritos locations. I'd say the Cerritos is my favorite as far as wait times and service. I have also gone to the one in Carlsbad when I lived over there and that is where I discovered the super scrum diddly umptious Jalapeño burger they have! Sooooo goooddddd lol. This BJs, however gave us pretty good service the first time. The wait wasn't too long and we had a nice experience. Last night we called ahead and spoke to a very nice employee named Autumn. She explained the wait time was 25 minutes so we asked to be added on the wait list. We drove over there as soon as we got off the phone with her. We arrived about 20 minutes later and noticed how packed it was and went up to the hostess to let her know we were there. She said she would call us once our table was ready. About 30 minutes pass by and we still hadn't got called. I don't have an issue with the wait because I saw how busy they were but I was wondering why we even called ahead and got on a wait list if we were going to end up waiting like we just arrived there anyway? I'm guessing it's just to make customers feel better. We ended up waiting the time like everyone else who just got there which kind of was a fail for us thinking we were covered on the wait list already. My bf was super hungry although I wasn't as hungry I was kind of bummed that the calling ahead didn't make a difference.  Right when we were going up to the hostess to tell her we were going to just go somewhere else we got the text that our table was ready, so we decided to stay since we already waited. We were sat and got a good sized booth for my bf, my son and I. The waiter came pretty quickly and was very nice to us.  We got a medium pizza half pepperoni extreme and half chicken bacon ranch (I loved it). We also got yummy Caesar salads to begin with and Nutty Brewnettes. My son got the apple juice and we all enjoyed our meal.  Overall service was good, food was good. The only issue was the wait list but it's understandable seeing it was a Saturday evening and all.

Shortly after we check in, another couple walks in and asks for a table for two also. Five minutes pass and they sit the couple that arrived after us first. We go check to see if they wrote our name down to be seated and they say ""Oh yeah, we are just getting your table ready."" Okay? That doesn't make sense, but sure. A few minutes pass and they call us to be seated and walk us to our table. When we get there, there's literally like 4-5 tables empty next to our table... Whatever. Finally we get seated and the server takes our order. The server was actually very friendly and attentive. No complaints there. The food was, however, dissapointing yet again. Pasta was drowning in pasta sauce that the four shrimp that were in there almost floated. Thet chicken was plain and had no flavor. I imagine that is how eating cardboard must feel like. In conclusion, make sure they take your name down when you check in. They're just hanging out in the front so it's easy for them to miss your name while they gossip.

Food was good, but the service was awful.  The hostess was snooty and kinda rude, funny that you're working at BJ's and not some five star restaurant. Get over yourself. Our original server was good, but when ours went on break we never saw the next guy. He brought us our food and that was it. We ordered a wedge salad with no bacon, and at first it looked correct but when we started eating we saw that the bacon was all over. We did not get one refill on our drinks.  I do have to point out that when we got the bill the salad was on it. It was taken off after we pointed it out. All in all, it was not the best BJ's we have ever been to.

Tori B.,"Westminster, CA",140,117,91,5.0,8/20/2015,"I don't know about these stories other people on Yelp are making up or why. BJ's is a great chain and this restaurant is consistently good. Good food and good service. Sure, I've been here on the crazy busy weekends where servers don't come check on you every five minutes. Who likes that, anyway? When you come on busy nights, if you are the sort of person who expects to be waited on hand and foot, I urge you to reconsider and just eat at home in your castle with your servants, not out with us common folk. Some highlights ... + 5.75 for a kids' meal. Choose your entree, type of side (ours enjoyed the smiley-face fries especially) and a drink. + Lunch deals, Mon-Fri until 3p. Kind of limited, but kind of awesome. Cheap prices on pizza, pastas, and sandwiches. We did the lunch pasta. It comes with your choice of soup or salad and is $1 cheaper than the normal pasta price. The lunch size still filled me up. Clam chowder was good. Served warm-hot. The Cajun chicken pasta was also good. Served piping hot. + Cheaper beers for lunch hour! Jeremiah Red is a good fruity choice and still has a 7.something ABV. Normally $5.50 a pint, came to about $3 during lunch time. + Friday afternoon, 2:30. Slow! Score. Server Cory was very friendly and attentive, but not too much so that it's annoying. He even offered to get my iced tea to go as we were paying! That was really cool. Here's the order .... tropical iced tea (free refills), chicken tender kids' meal with smiley fries and apple juice (served in a small cup with a lid, thank you), California chicken flat bread appetizer, two lunch orders of the Cajun chicken pasta with clam chowder, and a pint ... came to $48 after tax. We didn't have enough room for a Pazookie, which really feels like a crime! Skip the appetizer, save room for dessert!

Our table is litterally 3 steps from the bar and we're told we can no longer get happy hour prices, and the waitress recards everyone still drinking their booze...fine. We order 3 appetizers and ask them to be brought out before the food. 30 minutes later, no waiter no waitress *we had 2* i see them standing by the bar talking. So i get up and ask hey where are those apps? oh only 1 out of 3 was supposed to come out before....I ask everyone in my group they say no, the waiter and waitress take off. It's at this point we start walking to the bar to refill our drinks since the waiter and waitress haven't come back to check on us once at this 40 minute point finally 2 apps out of 3 come out. Food shows up, and before asking if anyone needs ranch or anything they just run away. At this point im livid, i open the kitchen door and ask for a few plates and some ranch. After getting the plates I talk tot he manager and am told ""oh wow....that's weird.....well i can get you some ranch"" Finally after the manager comes back they bring 4 plates of ranch with 3 different waiters sweet thanks.  After this everyone orders there pazaookies, the waitress and waiter combo send other people now to give us our food and forget to give us any spoons for the fucking thing. So we ask the new guys and they say sure no problem.They take 2 steps back and knock into another server with a pizza, the server drops it, one of the waiters say watch where your going to which the server that drops it screams ""YOU WATCH WHERE YOUR FUCKING GOING"" they go into the kitchen and start fighting.

After about another 5-10 minutes we inquired again and were told a party hasn't left yet. We saw another booth open that would fit our part perfectly and asked the hostess if we could be seated in that booth. We were told no, there is no server for that table (alright we're not ok now, the ""hangry"" children, poor service and lack of communication is now effecting us. We were just told our table was being cleaned). After over an hour wait time we are finally seated and asked to speak to the manager.

Parking lot can get busy at times depending on when you come. Service: I'm usually not picky on service, but as someone who works in the service industry, this has got to be an all time low for me.

I would have understood if it was a super busy night, but there were a lot of empty tables and they seemed very staffed.  After we ordered, our party of 4 changed to a party of 6 because 2 more of our friends decided to join us. We advised our server that we needed a bigger table and he said we will get one very shortly. Our 2 friends arrived really soon. The server sees that our group of 4 grew to 6, yet he said nothing. 15-20 mins arrive and we remind him that we are a party of 6 now and we need a new table. He says he's working on it still and then our food proceeds to come. One of our friends wanted to order something, flagged down one of the workers (who i believe was a food runner). That guy flat out told my friend he wasn't our server and just walked away continuing to do what he was doing. That's the first time I've ever experienced that kind of service. No matter what your job is, busser, runner etc. you don't tell a guest I'm not your server and just walk away. At the most you could have said I'm not your server, but I can get your server to see what you would like to add etc.   So finally 20 mins in, we get our table switch. We notice some some of the food were wrong. Fries were forgotten on my order, but they quickly fixed that. We had our sort of private patio room which was nice, and the server kept checking up on us. However the damage was already done as we all felt like the service started really bad. This being the Huntington Beach location and the headquarters just across the street, I expected their service to be at least decent. What a shame.  Drinks and Food: My favorite beer here to get is the Jeremiah Red. It's their signature beer, which is a strong ale and one of my favorite ones to get when I come here. The food is pretty good. Good sizable portions ranging from their pasta, to burgers. If you have room for your stomach, save room for dessert and order a pizookie.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=280
Penni C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",83,26,5,2.0,12/17/2014,I have been to BJS many times and to this location the most. It has been my go to spot for a long time. Service here the past few times has not been so great. I thought I would try again last night. Very sorry that I did. Waited for about five minutes for anyone to come to the table. Would not mind this if they were busy. But it was not. When the food came to the table we did not have any place settings. That took another several minutes to get while the food was getting cold. The server really did not check on us. We had to ask for more drinks. Let's not talk about how the menu has changed. This has not changed for the better. They need to bring back the old menu. If you are looking for a beer they have them. If you are looking for good food and good service this is not the place to come.  This will not be my go to spot anymore.

Frank O.,"Orange County, CA",154,60,41,3.0,6/7/2015,"We tried it again. Took a while for me to want to go, but my son got a reward at school for a free menu item, and he wanted to get their pasta.  It ended up being a pleasant dinner with descent food.  I really liked that they left the pizza in the pan again because it stayed warm longer, or at least it seemed as if it did. They service was considerably better than I expected especially for a night that they were very busy, So in this trip, we had descent service, the food was brought out in a fair amount of time and was not burnt, plus our son had a free meal. Perhaps I might offer BJ's up as a family dinner option again. I would not call it one of my favorites again, as it used to be, but perhaps if we have one or two more positive trips, maybe it can get there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=280

The restaurant was pretty empty, but just asking what the happy hour offers in the bar were was like pulling teeth.

From food to service. One day we were over charged $130 dollars because the machines weren't working. We were upset but they ended up fixing the problem. Today is November 4 2016 and I had a really bad experience.  My girlfriend ordered the chicken tortilla soup and I ordered  the steak. We waited 1 hour for the food. We didn't complain about the wait because it's a Friday night.  We had a problem with my steak. The steak was burned and the soup had a ton of hairs. At this point the waiter came and said he would bring the manager or owner on his request. We didn't ask for him because we were calm. The owner never came. We waited another 30 minutes for the food to come out. My steak came out and again it was burned.  I was fed up so I didn't eat it.  By the way I didn't mention my girlfriends replacement soup because the waiter forgot it and just brought the bill.  Once again he said the ""owner"" would come but once again he didn't.  I was still charged full price for all this. We always order the exact same thing.  We aren't people that like to complain but this was to much.  I hope someone could get back to me because I payed for all my food to not have it served.

The hush puppies were a great starter, and cooked perfectly. The citrus salmon was amazing. The beers varied in flavor and hops. There were several palate cleansers to prepare us for the next course and beer tasting. The pazookie with vanilla ice cream and caramel drizzled was well worth the calories.

Adam A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,22,3,1.0,10/22/2014,"Its sad when a favorite hang out spot like Bj's Pizza is ruined by bad management and that's exactly what happened to me on a very special night.......... I came here on a Saturday night to celebrate a big event in my life and we were seated, served and treated with respect by the waitress until a giant cricket jumped on our table, in front of my wife and scared the living Christ out of us. The cricket proceeded to jump all around the table, booth, bench and over my wife several times as the bus boy was swatting at it  with his cleaning cloth. Wow, ok well my wife and I had seen enough so we asked for the bill because we were not about to dine with the cricket guts all over our table area.  The waitress was very busy so my wife went to the hostess booth to explain what happened and the hostess was very polite and demanded that we explain what happened to the manager. This is where it all went down hill...... Manager: ""You had to talk to me about something?"" (angry and upset that we pulled him away from some seemingly important undertaking) Wife: ""There was a giant cricket on our table and we are ready to go eat somewhere else because we lost our Bj's appetite.""  Manager: ""Well we all have crickets, its a pretty common thing, I have crickets at my house too."" Wife: ""Well we are ready to go so can we have the bill?"" Manager: ""Ill comp your pizza but that's  the best I can do"" Wife: ""Well thank you but we just want to get outta here so can we have the check?"" Manager: ""I cant comp the whole check."" (keep in mind we never asked for or intended to get any comp just the check and some respect for the situation, our check was $17 so far.. we were a party of two.....not trying to take advantage) Me: ""We don't want your comp pizza just give us the bill so we can leave"" ""So you say you have crickets at your house so were supposed to accept them here at Bj's?"" ""What does the Kitchen look like if theres bugs in the dining room?"" Manager: ""Look man, I compped the pizza for you so I don't know what else you want me to do......"" AS YOU CAN SEE: this is a simple ""Dropping the ball"" situation in customer service.

Brian B.,"Anaheim Hills, CA",426,698,43,1.0,10/15/2015,"Some friends and I went to your location to watch the Raiders vs. Broncos game. When we arrived all of the TVs in the restaurant were on other NFL games from all around the league. When those games had finished we asked our server if one of the TVs could please be changed to the Raiders game? The response we received was ridiculous. She stated ""We do not show Raiders games here, this is a family restaurant."" At first we thought she was joking with us, but when the Rams fan at the table next to us turned around and asked her, ""That's a joke right?"" She again stated ""We do not show Raiders games in this restaurant because this is a family restaurant."" She then went on to say that she would ask the manager, when she returned she told us they said no, and we would have to go somewhere else. At that point we sent back everything we ordered and we left. I do not understand how you can advertise that your establishment is the place to go to watch the NFL. But yet do not allow certain people to do so based on who they cheer for? We were told that Raiders games cause violence, foul language and chaos in the restaurant. So because we cheer for the Oakland Raiders we are profiled as violent, foul, and trouble makers? For this we will NEVER step foot in any one of your establishments again. Raiders fans are not all foul, violent, or problem starters, but what we are is a FAMILY, and in your managers own words this FAMILY is not welcome in your ""family"" restaurant. I wonder if we had asked to put on the Broncos game, the channel would've been changed, but we were profiled as Raiders so basically asked to leave. I wonder if this is a corporate decision or if a server, bartender, or manager is making the executive decision to exclude teams. Maybe y'all should just put up a sign, the place to watch the NFL, except the Raiders. Wait, is it just the Raiders? My wife likes the Patriots, do you side that Pats are cheaters and not show their games? What about Dodgers, again there was just another beating over the Dodgers? Riots happen after Lakers playoffs, do you not show Lakers games?  Not like I am a huge fan of your restaurants, I cannot think of a single positive experience. Maybe someone at corporate should read the reviews, or read my reviews, there are several, and I believe they all highlight negative experiences around service. And your mediocre food does not make up for horrible service.  Enough chances, I think I am over you restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=300

My boyfriend had suggested this place because he loved it and I had never been so mind you this is my first experience here and my last. we decided to stop by one day for a late lunch around 4 on a weekday and it was slow so we got seated right away and then we met the waitress . The whole time she had one of those ""I hate my job but here I am what do you want"" kind of attitudes so I just ignored it ordered my food which didn't take too long to come out it was good , but after that the waitress just completely forgot we were in the establishment didn't stop by once didn't come to see if we needed anything nothing at all it's like she had vanished . But still it was my first time so my boyfriend was completely pumped and told me I had to try the pazookie because it's everything I would love. Then a little more than half way through our meal waitress stops by doesn't say a word drops off the check and a box for our food . At this point I was upset , she was super rude didn't ask if we were done if we needed anything maybe like refills on our drinks? If we wanted dessert or anything to-go nothing .. So we paid our tab and left it completely ruined it for me I seriously don't ever want to go back because of their services .

The drinks and food arrived at a good time. Our family shared the deep dish pizza; it was cooked to perfection, the veggies tasted fresh, and it was enough for the whole family ( five people).

After waiting for over an hour to be seated, we get taken to our table. Waiter asks what we'd like to drink, I order a Moscow Mule, at which point he informs me that he would have to talk to the bartender to see if they have an open ginger beer, and if they do not, then I would have to ""pay for the whole ginger beer($7.95), on top of the price of the mixed drink($10/12) that includes ginger beer!!!!!! That would be a $20 Moscow Mule!!!!!  The manager comes up and said he was told someone had a question... I never asked to speak to him, but thinking he would be a reasonable fellow and want to provide excellent customer service, he adamantly stated this was their policy. So I asked, so if I'm lucky enough to that someone else is ordering this same drink at the same time, I can have one for the normal price? But when would that be? So basically you cannot order a Mule with out paying for the whole ginger beer, so you pay for two drinks to get one. Unbelievable!!! I said I'll just save my money and ordered water.

We were just in two nights ago and we were that couple that come in like 30 minutes before closing and the manager and only server on were extremely nice about it. (My bf and I both work in the restaurant business and we know what's in like to get those late walk in so we were going to just get a quick bite and be in and out.) The server was awesome, checking up on us making sure we had napkins, plates, utensils, and that our drinks were filled to our liking. Usually servers will give bad service in these types of occasions because they most likely are dying to go home, but this guy was awesome, really wish I would have remembered his name. The whole process took about 25 minutes, which was great. We were out in no time and left with happy filled tummies.

Akiko I.,"Orange County, CA",1460,1443,13972,3.0,3/25/2013,"- Locale Destination -  Happy hour - $4 for beer, cocktails and $4~6 appetizers. Lots of TVs for games. Somehow they used almost all the TVs for ""Lakers"" switching the awesome game by Miami Heat. Good for Lakers fans. Don't be a hater just because Heat is awesome ! Of course, you can ask the staff to switch the channels ;p Service: Not focused and very slow. The staff do need proper trainings. They seemed nice when they actually attended the tables but rarely come back to the customers. Many of the customers at podium often wondered to get their attention despite of many staffing. I saw my server had to deal with stupid guests who couldn't figure out the prices of happy hour items. She couldn't explain the prices to the stupid and upset customers and the big manager had to step in. It took forever for food to come, for drinks to be refilled, for dirty dishes to be picked up, for customers to catch their servers... The services were very very slow despite of the fact they had plenty of staff. So I was so careless to stay there for the entire Miami Heat's game ;p - Gluttony Expedition -  Strawberry lemonade : Way too sweet. CA club flatbread: Chicken, avocado and diced tomato on the flatbread. Small but good for appetizer. Not bad for $4 - happy hour! Chocolate ice cream:  Very thick.

Jess G.,"Downey, CA",349,349,1553,4.0,2/7/2015,"Disclaimer: I'm a huge fan of BJ's Brewery. The wait was about 30 minutes-1 hour on a Saturday night at 7:30 pm. It wasn't bad because sometime during that time span, a magical man from the kitchen came by bearing free cheese pizza! He visited twice so I got 2 slices of pizza just for waiting. The BJ's service was decent for a busy Saturday night. It was lagging in quickness but I was in no rush so this wasn't a problem for me. Don't go to any BJ's location on a weekend dinner night if you're on a time schedule because their service in terms of time is relaxed. They won't forget about your empty beverage glass but you'd wait anywhere from 10-20 minutes just to get that beverage glass refilled.

James L.,"Garden Grove, CA",1105,935,1830,1.0,8/4/2014,"BJ's - you've made it to my one star list! The service on the night that I came was excruciatingly slow. We had a table of 7 people and used this night to catch up since we had a friend who flew in town for the week. It was a Thursday night and the restaurant seemed like it was pretty full. Our first server took our drink order and shortly after, was gone for the evening. She introduced us to the person who was going to ""take care of us"" the rest of the night. The first server looked unhappy to be there, not at all pleasant so it seemed like a huge plus we were getting someone else. The second person was slightly better but something was definitely going on in the kitchen because our food came out so slow. At different points of the night, we couldn't flag down our server (to get drink refills, to order dessert, to pay for our bill). It was mind numbingly slow! To top it all off, the pizza I got was pathetic and I try not to be so harsh in my reviews but I have nothing kind to say about it. I ordered the Great White and there was nothing great about it. I felt like they skipped the sauce or something so it was literally pizza dough and toppings. Normally, I would send it back or bring it to thr server's attention, but if you read the few paragraphs above, that would send us into another time warp until anything would come out correctly. I was sorely disappointed this night and have no intentions to come back.

Tiffany L.,"Costa Mesa, CA",178,68,16,5.0,9/7/2014,"Since my youngin' high school days, this is always been the place for late night appetizers and pizookies. I have not had a bad experience (at this location) ever! They are open pretty late for a restaurant... closing at 12-1 AM. I'm here a lot for their happy hour too. Food: You can't go wrong with the pizza here; both the flatbreads and the deep dish pizzas are awesome. But honestly, you can really get full and get your money's worth if you know what you are doing. They have a small-bites section for only $4-5 each dish. I don't know why but their small-bites mac and cheese is really filling! I order this for my meal + pizookie = I'm already full. Check out their fried artichoke and their small salads too! Also, utilize their happy hour! They have $4-6 dishes, and their spinach dip and buffalo wings are very good too! You can get half of a flatbread pizza for $4, which is good for the late night food cravings. As for their pizookies, if you know you aren't going to finish a whole one to yourself or your friends want different things, you can order the mini's for a cheaper prices.  Drinks: WOW, you must try their water. It's the best water I've ever had. Just kidding.. but seriously check out their beers! They have good house craft beers, especially their brand. The pale ale and the hefe are awesome. They also carry other craft beers as well and some of them are not listed on their menu. You have to be a loser like me and walk from one end of the bar to another to see which craft beers on tap they have. For example, the menu did not have Bootlegger's Palomino Pale Ale. However, in the corner of my eye, I saw the beer tap handle on one end of the bar. I saw Green Flash and Stone IPA as well. So keep your eye out for the beers that you want!

Diana N.,"Westminster, CA",255,367,514,4.0,7/5/2013,"My boyfriend took me here for lunch to celebrate our 5-month anniversary. Plus, he obtained an offer on Facebook that was a BOGO Free for any entree. In addition, my review may be a little biased considering the fact that this place has sentimental value for the both of us.  We waited around 15 minutes for a table (they offer pagers for you that doesn't work beyond the BJs facility, so be sure to stay nearby). I ended up ordering a PARMESAN CRUSTED CHICKEN SANDWICH w/ CRISP STRING FRIES (lunch menu) and my boyfriend ordered a LUNCH SIZE SALMON TERIYAKI over RICE PILAF (sauteed with white onions, red bell peppers, napa cabbage, green onions and sweet baby carrots, tossed with teriyaki sauce. served over white rice and topped with sesame seeds). The PARMESAN CRUSTED CHICKEN SANDWICH was cut in half by default (which I always love), and stayed crispy throughout all my bites. I was able to finish one half and my boyfriend was able to finish the other half. The amount of parmesan was perfect considering that I'm not a fond fan of overwhelming cheese flavors. The sandwich also came with what seemed like an acidic coleslaw immersed within the sandwich. As for the CRISPY STRING FRIES, they were a little bit of a disappointment. I assumed they were going to be crispy and straight considering that they had less surface area and width to be fried though, but there were a lot of fries that were limp and could have been even crispier.  As for the boyfriend's LUNCH SIZE SALMON TERIYAKI over RICE PILAF, it was a perfect amount for lunch (unless you are super starving). The only thing we both had to complain about the entree was how the rice pilaf and the salmon bits were drenched in too much teriyaki sauce. Although the salmon was cooked perfectly, all we were able to taste was the teriyaki sauce. As a result, it made the dish too salty and our mouths too thirsty. I recommend having the sauce on the side so you can pour your perfect amount of teriyaki sauce.

The servers could care less about their tables. Everyone is disengaged and they make you feel as if you are a burden on them and taking up their time.  Earlier I was in and ordered a medium pizza with pepperoni and pineapple, half of it with olives added. When I received my pizza only 2 of the pieces were with out olives, so It made it difficult because I was with 3 small children, 2 of which do not like olives. . We didn't receive any napkins or roll ups/silverware until we basically gunned down our server to ask him. It's a hassle to be accommodated in the slightest of ways.  I don't know why I continue to give BJs a try, but each time it is dissatisfactory.

Elle H.,"Los Angeles, CA",90,50,1,3.0,2/24/2015,"Starting this out by saying that I'm a New Yorker. Nothing compares to a slice of authentic NYC pizza. The sauce....the cheese....the crust! We New Yorkers don't pack our pizzas with toppings like the rest of the US does. This being said....I don't mind eating here which means that the pizza is at least decent! That or I'm slowly being corrupted by california.... So Chicago pizza is pretty much blasphemy as far as I'm concerned, but this isn't really Chicago style deep dish. It's more like really thick bland crust. The sauce and cheese are what makes this pizza acceptable to eat for me. I come at least once a month because my boyfriend is gaga over the pizookies (cookie pizza with ice cream on top). The peanut butter marshmallow one is really good though....can't go to BJ's without getting one! The drink menu is also pretty good. I've only ordered their BJ's brand beer once, and it was good but nothing worth writing home for. Their seasonal specialty drinks are really great though!  The servers are great! I like the ambiance too. As far as wait time, it always takes about 10 minutes to sit down even if it's just 2 people and parking always takes awhile.

We were sat immediately, and waited..and waited..and waited...Forever to even get our drink orders. Mind you plenty of people have walked by us and not one person stopped to ask if we had been helped. My boyfriend and I had a question about some stuff and finally caught the manager and asked him. I wonder if he wondered why we didn't ask our server..hmm. Finally, our server brought out our waters and then bailed again to drop off water refills to another table. He expressed how it was his 2nd day and it was so much to learn. He apologized profusely, but still has yet to take our order. About 15 minutes has gone by since we sat down and all we have are our waters. Once we finally got our order taken the waiting began again. We ordered the 2 for 25 deal, meaning we literally ordered everything at that one point to our server...never saw him again. We waited another 15 minutes and the soups we ordered never came, I stopped him as he had been walking up and down his table section and he said he'd check on our salads. We ordered soups. He came back out and said ""has my manager been by about the soup? I was just told we were out of clam chowder and they are making you a new one now."" I asked to speak to the manager, a lousy excuse for one at that. He said he was sorry gave the same story about the soups and said our pizza was up. I told him if the pizza was ready to just bring it out and we'll figure out the soups later. He said ok I'll get everything going. 5 more minutes went by. I know that doesn't seem like a lot but when you're hungry it's a lifetime. My boyfriend and I decided we would give them 60 seconds to bring out our pizza or we were gonna bail and drive thru somewhere. Our server got to the table right when the timer started and I informed him of our plan. Before time was up we got our pizza and our soups. The manager came over and all he did was offer an extra pizookie. I told him yeah yeah whatever just so we could start eating, but we didn't want it. It was just ridiculous. By the time we got the check all that was on there was pizza, but we spent almost an hour and 15 minutes there. I'll never be back. EVER.

Criselle M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",60,22,9,1.0,2/23/2016,"I am insanely disappointed in my visit to BJ's this afternoon. My friend and I got to the restaurant at 11:40 and were seated pretty promptly and ordered right away because we already knew what we wanted. I ordered the dinner sized portion of the salmon and quinoa and my friend ordered the salad with ahi tuna. We waited for our order for 40 minutes, finally at 12:30 we asked for our food which had not come out yet to be bagged as take out for us to just take back to work and eat. The server, Ryan, was very nice, and informed us that the salmon usually takes 15 minutes to cook. But from being seated and ordering at 11:50am to not receiving our food until after 40 minutes of waiting did not make up for the fact it took twice as long to cook my 15 minute salmon. Now here is the real kicker. Once I did get to open my to-go box up expecting to see a dinner portion of salmon and quinoa, I am met with less than a cup of quinoa scattered around my salmon. I've had the lunch portion of salmon and quinoa bowl at the BJ's in Torrance, and what was in my to-go box did not even measure up to that. There was probably enough asparagus and mushrooms, and the salmon was a good size, but did they not even think that I would notice that I had at most 4 spoonfuls of quinoa as my dinner entrée? I took a picture and will post it after I finish this little rant. But I hope that you who are reading this know that BJs had poor service at lunch time, middle of the week on a Tuesday, and that they bamboozle you with their take-out food. I am 100% sure they knew that I was getting a substandard portion for a lunch and dinner portion, and that absolutely disgusts me. Shame on you cooks!

This was my 3rd time to a BJ's in the last year and I've been underwhelmed all 3 times.  This latest time, my niece chose BJ's for her bday dinner.  This location is pretty big and it was packed on a Thursday night. The server was cute and pleasant.   We order several small appetizer plates (calamari, fried artichokes and corn fritters with bacon aioli), a large deep dish pizza, parmesan chicken with mashed potatoes, and chicken limone with linguine.  We waited a good 20-25 minutes before any food arrived but then suddenly they brought all of the appetizers AND the pizza out at the same time.  A few minutes later, the two chicken plates arrived.  Unfortunately, the appetizers may have sat out while waiting to be delivered to our table because they were just lukewarm.  I'll usually eat anything that's deep-fried but even I wasn't that tempted by our appetizers to try more than a bit of each item.  Worse, the pizza was also only semi-hot.  The flavor of the pizza was really only just ok, especially since it wasn't piping hot.  The two chicken dishes tasted quite good but those were also not super hot.  We didn't send any food back but it was just disappointing that nothing was hot and the appetizers were quite bland.  My niece got a free mini-Pizookie topped with a scoop of ice cream.   What is all the fuss about the Pizookie??!  In my opinion, the cookie was really thin and too crusty.

We opted for the trio with Chocolate Chunk, Cookies & Cream and Salted Caramel. Funny, the waitress insisted that Chocolate Chunk was chocolate chip and the Cookies & Cream was Oreo. You would think they should refer to menu items by the names on the menu. But, no biggie. Of course, the pizookies were delish. I had never had the Salted Caramel before and it is my new favorite. My friend also ordered the beignet for us to share. That was truly disappointing. I've had beignets several times at different locations. They are always small bites you can eat with your fingers and they usually come with a dipping sauce. This beignet was about the size of a hamburger. It was drenched with strawberry sauce and ice cream with a few sliced berries. It was soft and doughy, like eating underbaked bread. Bleh! Lesson learned, just won't order that again.  For the most part, our service was very good. Our waitress, Susan P, was very attentive and friendly. We didn't have to wait too long for anything. Until the end. She brought the check.

I laughed and didn't say anything.. Worst part was that the server said manager will be right with u and I waited and nothing .. What a great manager ,...

Mixie G.,"Riverside, CA",1,2,,1.0,7/31/2015,"I came in with a party of 15 and had a reservation on Monday, July 27th. We had 2 servers that sat us in the back corner which was nice but that's the only part of it that was. It took almost 20 minutes to just get waters and even longer than that to get drinks from the bar. Also took us over an hour to put in a food order. Once the food got to the table, half of it was cold and they forgot 3 different meals. When we had asked for the check we were informed by the waitress that since we had a large party, we couldn't split the check. Our servers barely gave us any attention, in fact other waiters/waitresses ended up helping us. I will never come to this location again nor will I refer anyone to there.

Also, if you order a large pizza, theyll let you make it half & half, as in half mediterranean, half buffalo chicken, for ex., so that was also a plus Was craving fries so they let us order seasoned steak fries or reg, we got both, conclusion: steak fries ftw For dessert, we got the pizookie party platter w/4 diff kinds of pizookies. Our rankings: 1st- raspberry w/white chocolate chips, sooo good, esp. since im a white choco fan haha 2nd- red velvet (bc its red velvet, come on) 3rd- bj's famous, its a classic chocolate chip cookie i believe 4th- triple chocolate, this was too sweet and had too much chocolate for us but it is called triple choco so that shouldve been an indicator haha Service was incredible, our waiters were awesome, esp. the one who served us first before his shift ended, our orders probably took 20 min every time we ordered some more but the waiter kept us up to date w/the food status and he was extremely enthusiastic,friendly,&helpful, he even asked us about our murder mystery dinner throughout the night hahaha Overall, we paid about $15/person after ordering 3 large sharable pizzas, 1 large deep dish pizza, 2 side orders of fries, pizookie party platter, and maybe 1 other entree and gratituity was included.

On service alone, this place would've gotten 5 stars and more. I had two of the best waiters ever. They were super attentive, quick, and hilarious to boot. Also, they handled us well seeing as how we had about 20 people there that day. However, the other servers that came to help here and there were not as attentive. A friend had to ask for something over 3 times before they brought it out for her. The food was off too. It seemed as though everyone's food was just a little saltier than normal. My clam chowder tasted like an entire bucket of salt was dumped into it. It made it hard to swallow. A lot of food also came out late, but it's cold temperature indicated that it was forgotten rather than prepared slowly.  I may have just come at an off day.

You have to go all the way passed edinger to the next light to make the u turn or take a left to enter in the big plaza. Anyways, I had a server named Jaelene M and she was awesome. Gave us samples of beers and checked up on us multiple times. Food is good as any other BJs. Nothing too special/great or bad. I got full from the beer. I got the BJS porter and it was chocolatey but a bit watery smooth. If that makes any sense lol. It was a lighter stout and wasn't as strong.

He acted annoyed and like it was going to be too complicated- we ended up only ordering 3 things and 5 waters... then when the food came he came back and asked if everything was tasting okay before we got to try it- still acceptable. But then after about 1 more minute he came back and asked to start a desert, so I awkwardly told him maybe later (knowing that my coworker told him it was my birthday). At the end of the meal he tried to give us our checks and to have a nice day so I mentioned to him ""didn't they tell you it was my birthday?"" he said ""oh yea, okay"" and started walking away- and then I asked him ""well don't I get to pick a pizookie?"" and he reluctantly started to list a few for me.

Topher J.,"Newport Beach, CA",58,74,217,2.0,6/8/2014,"I've been here many times before and as I age and try finer cuisines I can fully appreciate the lack of customer service and quality available at this eatery.  My most recent experience, I had a reservation for 12, arrived on time, only the front lady wouldn't let us sit until more than half the people. That is reasonable, which is fine, only I explained to her that we would prefer to be seated now to start ordering our food. My family always orders ""asian style"", or a more politically correct, ""family style"", and we always share our food. So getting that head start and ordering for the whole gang would not only save our time but their time. Needless to say, they wouldn't let us do that. When I come here, I always need to bring tums. The food is sooo oily I could wring it out to lube my car parts, my lover, as well as my hair - if oiled hair were still in style of course! Either way, I always get a massive heart burn after eating here. I would rather stick to the whole foods ""serve-your-self"" bar! The atmosphere is nice though! It's loud enough to transform awkward moments into comfortable ones, and release some gas, and quiet enough to make conversation. The food we ordered could be described as followed: Pizzas - too doughy and thick, salty, not flavored very well Salads - dry meats on top, dressings are okay Ribs - dry but came off the bone easily, but very very dry  Baby burgers - decent, it's just the average baby burger Cheese sticks - didn't have cheese, was just a fried case of missing cheese",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=380

Tyler J.,"Fountain Valley, CA",38,5,1,1.0,2/18/2014,"Signed up to Yelp just to share the terrible experience I had here.  Valentine's day. Couldn't get a babysitter, so my wife and I decided to cheat on our diets and get some to go food. Settled on BJ's - an old standby chain we've been eating at for 15 years. 6:30 - My wife calls and orders 1 pizza, 1 brochette, 2 root beers. Should be done in 20 minutes. 6:55 - I admittedly lagged a little and found that the place was so slammed for Valentine's Day, I couldn't find an open spot on their curbside service. Circled the parking lot for a while until one opened up. 7:10 - Found a spot! Called the number. Server came out, took my card, swiped it.  7:12 - Signed my copy. Tipped server $3.00. He said my food would be right out. 7:15 - Started to wait. Got on my phone and caught myself up on Pinterest (don't judge!).  7:30 - Notice that I'm watching people come and go. This isn't right. My phone started to die, so I called to check on my food order. The girl said ""Let me go check in the kitchen. I don't see it out here."" 7:32 - Phone dies. Getting angry. I couldn't leave since I already paid. Regretted leaving a tip. 7:35 - Manager comes out hands me a gift card with an unspecified amount on it. Apologizes for making me wait. Said they're putting a new pizza in for me because the first one was cold and gross. ""It should only take 5 minutes"". Mentions he'll get my Root Beers too. 7:50 - Server finally comes out with a bag of food. Half-hearted ""sorry to make you wait"" with no explanation. Mentioned he put in some cards for free Piezookies in there. (Great. I guess I'll save it for next time I decided to eat crappy...?) I was so over it by this point, I just wanted to get out of there and get home. 7:55 - I scream profanities in my car. I get on Edinger to take the freeway home. Realize they forgot my drinks!! Drive around the block to get back BJ's. 8:00 - Have to go in (Phone was dead). Tell the to-go girl that I was the guy they made wait 45 minutes outside and that they forgot my drinks. She looks startled and we both see my drinks sitting on the counter behind her. She apologizes puts them in a carrier for me, and I leave. 8:15 - I get home. My wife was starting to get really worried for me. I explain the situation to her. We roll our eyes at the gift cards. They can give us free food, but they can't give us back our evening which they nearly ruined. 8:20 - I bite into my pizza. It was totally undercooked. Soggy, doughy crust and the cheese wasn't even fully melted. I had to throw it into my oven to make it decent. All in all, an incredibly frustrating evening. I get that it was a holiday and a Friday and they were slammed, but that's still no excuse for completely forgetting about my order and then just saying ""sorry"" with no explanation. Never had a problem with BJ's before, but after that night, I'm sure I'll ever go to this BJ's location again. It seems like a lot of the negative reviews have been fairly recent.

Noemi C.,"Buena Park, CA",4,288,50,1.0,7/4/2014,"HORRIBLE AND DISGUSTING! We were a party of four on a Sunday evening, around 6pm. My party and I were only there for pizza and beer. We should have known better and gone to a mom's and pop's pizza joint, but because we were near the area...we said what the heck? We arrived and were told that it'd be a 15 minute wait, then another person stated that they could seat us. So...we didn't wait more than five minutes; which was great! Here comes the crappy part...our waitress (can't remember her name), was very kind to the rest of my party, but not me. I was the only female in our party and maybe she just decided that she could get away with giving me an attitude. I asked for a veggie pizza with gluten free crust. She stated that I couldn't order my pizza that way. I asked why, if I've never had a problem ordering the pizza that way in the past. She became visibly annoyed and responded in a very rude manner. She stated that a gluten free pizza was cheese only. I found that hard to believe and she took a deep breath and sighed. I told her that there was no reason for her to give me attitude and that I didn't appreciate the way that she was talking to me. Her attitude completely changed after I made her aware of her horrible personality and lack of dialogue.  Long story short...I ordered a veggie pizza (not gluten free), and it was bland, cold, and disgusting! I only had half of slice and sent it back. I then ordered a pan cheese pizza and that was also disgusting. Needless to say, I threw up a few times when I arrived home.  I want to believe the BJ's staff would not tamper with my food, but because I made the female waitresses aware of her horrible service; you just never know?!

Don't get me wrong, this BJ's always has the best tasting food and rarely do I ever get a bad waiter/waitress, they're usually really nice and even good looking to top it off. The reason it's only three stars is the food is great and has good prices but the appetizers are the price of an entree but half the size or extremely less! Also, the reason this BJ's specifically gets three stars is because of how long it takes to get seated and get your order taken. There was once where I had to wait forty five minutes for my reservation and the entire left side of the room was empty and people who came in after me were seated first.

My favorite thing to eat here for lunch is their barbecue chicken salad (no beans).  The lunch portion is a perfect size, and you can add a bowl of soup for a couple dollars more.   For late night meals, my friend and I share the appetizer combo plate (we sub out the mozzarella sticks for whichever one of the other 4 options that we are craving that day).  They have good ""small bites"".  My cousin told me about their feta watermelon salad, which doesn't sound great...but it's delicious!  I also like their fried artichokes.  They have a vast majority of drinks to choose from, but I usually get their margaritas because I am boring. Their happy hour is great if you're in the mood for pizza.  Their mini pizzas are half off, appetizers are $2 off, and a little discount on the drinks during happy hour.  I like to get the BJs works pizza, the great white, or pepperoni and pineapple.   How can I review BJs and not talk about the amazing pizookies.  The cookies are warm, soft, gooey, and delicious.  I usually get half oreo and half white chocolate.   Overall, this place is awesome.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=340

When we arrived we had to wait about 10 minutes which was not bad (thank God we called ahead or else the wait was an hour).  Once we sat down we agreed that pizza was the definite choice for all of us except my cousin. Our server was friendly. The problem I had with her was that she was not very organized. We asked for a pepperoni and meatball pizza but instead we received pepperoni sausage. I didn't mind because that topping is still good to me, but for the other people eating the pizza they were not too thrilled. I figured okay everyone makes mistakes, but about 10 minutes later when my cousin got her dish the order was wrong as well. My cousin asked our waitress to make sure that what she asked to be removed from the dish wouldn't be on there and the waitress said she got it. Well clearly she didn't fulfill my cousins wish. We all felt bad cause we were eating while she was waiting for her dish to be corrected.  All in all I don't think I will be returning to this location because of this experience.  I think the 3 hours we spent here shouldn't have been the case, but messing up orders and slow service will definitely cause this.  +2 stars for the food tasting good as well as the dessert.  -3 stars for our food being wrong, as well as the really slow service.

Jessica E.,"Huntington Beach, CA",4,11,,1.0,6/2/2016,"I made reservations for my roommates surprise birthday party at this location over a month ago for the patio. We went tonight and I was surprised to hear my guests tell me that the manager came out and told them to hurry up and eat bc they have another table coming at 8:15. I had my roommate come about a half an hour after the guests were there so that it was a surprise. We ordered right when we got there and I asked the waiter about what the manager had told the guests. He said don't worry about it and to enjoy our time. My mother went to the bathroom and overheard the manager talking rudely about our group and saying we had been there two hours and needed to leave. We had been super nice to our waitress and were very quick with eating and ordering. When one of the guests approached the manager about what my mother had heard, she shrugged it off and said I don't know what you're talking about. No apology, nothing. He didn't even come out to the table to say sorry or anything which we would have forgiven him if he did. Instead he stood there and gave us dirty looks and continued to talk trash about us. I know it's cliche to say but I have been a loyal customer of this location for years, as has my roommate which is why I chose the location and I've never been so offended at a place of Buisness before. Our waitress was still tipped nicely because she was very nice and caught in a bad situation, but myself and all of my guests(15) will not be eating at this location again. We were even worried that he may have done something to our food after the way we were treated. I just don't understand, I work in a well known retail location and had several waitresses in attendance and we would NEVER treat customers like that especially if they were being as nice as we were. I think this location needs some work and new management pronto.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=420

We did, however,  had the pleasure of experiencing an unruly guest. What ever the servers or managers did to try and please her just didn't make her happy. She was creating a scene, storming off, but not before she could take everything with her, yelling rudely at her family and at the servers to get her stuff, walking out on their check. I was afraid she was going to fall out of her dress with all that stomping around.  We felt so bad for the servers and manager who did everything to try to please an unpleasable guest.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=420
Lucy Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",196,1418,6066,4.0,8/31/2011,"I came here with a group of 30+ on a weeknight for a work dinner for my bf's company, and left impressed with the ambience, service and food.  Parking was super easy in the big, free lot, starting the experience off right!  When we walked in, huge flat screen TVs above the big bar and around the place gave it a fun-feeling atmosphere.  Our group was seated in the front area, which isn't usually private but became our private area because it was the right size for all of us.  Our server was Lisa C, and throughout the evening, she was nonstop warm and friendly, got everything spot on, re-filled waters and took additional drink orders as glasses got low, and was all around AWESOME! There was a lot of food at the table, so we tried a bunch of appetizers: Spinach Artichoke Dip - creamy, cheesy, yummy with the crunchy chips that came with - a classic! Avocado Eggrolls - WAY too chipotle spicy!  Whoa, seriously - maybe I got a super spicy bite or something, and granted I am a spicy food wuss, but the creamy chipotle dressing wasn't even remotely cooled by the ripe avocado chunks.   Mozzarella Sticks - yummy with the marinara dipping sauce! Ahi Tuna Poke - served with wonton skin chips and garnished wth avocado cubes and napa cabbage, it was tasty and the presentation was pretty - but the fish was WAY salty.  It tasted like the marinade was just pure soy sauce. Dinner salads that came with our meals landed in front of us as soon as we ordered.  I chose the Caesar instead of the garden or the tomato mozzarella.  Mine was a nice sized salad, but WAY over-dressed. Our entrees came out pretty fast: Me: NY Steak - a 12 oz steak, served rare and salt-free, just as I ordered it.  It came with a ginormous baked potato, and I requested steamed green beans.  This steak definitely satisfied my meat craving, but of course I'm partial to a ribeye. Bf: Jambalaya - a big portion, with perfectly cooked shrimp, slightly spicy.  Bf liked it - and I stole a few plump shrimp! I was impressed that the menu offers gluten free pizza crust AND a gluten free pizookie (gluten free beer too, even)!  So of course, we had to try:   Gluten Free Mini Pizookie - a single fresh baked chocolate chip cookie, baked in a mini pan and topped with vanilla ice cream.  Yum!  I wouldn't have known it was gluten free if  had just dug in.  Yay! Our server Lisa was so super awesome that she even packed a few pizookies to go - with the ice cream separate, so that they wouldn't arrive home with a creamy puddle.  And when I got my ginormous baked potato to go, and requested sour cream in a little container, she didn't bat an eye, she just made sure I didn't want butter and chives too - and then she brought it right over. It's been a while since I visited a BJ's, but if Lisa is any indication of the service that this chain offers, I'll gladly be back to try that gluten free pizza cust.  I'll just ask for really easy dressing on my Caesar salad! Thank you bf's company, for our dinner at BJ's, and thank you Lisa for being so on top of your game!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=420

Dmitriy S.,"Santa Clara, CA",293,905,2950,4.0,11/13/2011,"Believe it or not, this was only my 2nd time at a BJs, with my first time being the night of a very awkward high school junior prom. This time around, I didn't have to worry about impressing my date or being too loud. This time, it was fellow Yelp Elite Kathleen W.'s birthday, and you know we had to do it big.  We started out with a couple of beers, and I chose their signature Piranha Pale Ale. Not the best pale ale I've had, but it was pretty much perfect for the meal. It was just at the right bitterness level. Of course, we got Kathleen something stronger, which easily amplified her perky attitude.  We went with the Spinach and Artichoke Dip to share between the entire table as an appetizer, and it was quite delicious. Tons of dip to go all around, but too many chips were left over with the dip all gone. Gotta hate that... For the main dish, places like BJs, Cheesecake Factory, Olive Garden, etc tend to give you 10 pages to choose from, which ends up making you take half an hour to decide on what the hell you want to eat. Simple solution here: get the deep dish pizza. We split a large one between 3 people and it left our stomachs bulging. I recommend the BJ's Favorite and Gourmet Five Meat pizzas. Both are delicious. Props to Laura C (at least that's her name on my receipt; short haired filipino girl) for being an amazing waitress.

David C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",114,89,56,2.0,8/5/2012,"The food I recommend: Ribs! Get the full rack because it's only a slight increase in the price in comparison to the half rack of ribs. You also get a starter choice of clam chowder or any soup they have that day. Don't forget to ask for their clam chowder crackers also. They usually don't bring it out unless you ask for it.   Hint: Instead of getting mash potatoes or baked potatoes as a side with your entree of ribs, you may choose to get the side as another clam chowder, that way you'll have 2 clam chowders to share with your significant other! Drinks: Beer-wise. I'd recommend getting the Sampler. You get 8 different beers for about $12. Not only do you get a variety, but it's also fun with a group of friends! You don't get too full over it.  I'm giving BJ's 2 stars because of my last experience. ""I've experienced better basically."" I had dinner there last night with my girlfriend. While we were waiting for friends to arrive the server came out with the water. As he placed each one down the very last one fell towards me and onto the floor. The glass of water broke into pieces and I could feel the water soaking up my left leg of my jean. My girlfriend, who had heels and a skirt, was in danger of being cut from the broken glass. We checked to see if any shards pierced her. Now the table was also wet along with the surrounding area of our table. The server left u there to go get a broom. While our server was gone the nearby table was talking to each other about possibly suing BJ's if that were to happen to them. On the other hand, we seemed to be OK and felt like it wasn't necessary. Well, the server came back and scooped up the glass. However, he just came back with the broom and the scooper. How was he to know where all the pieces were though? BJ's lighting is quite dim so he was merely assuming he was finding all the glass. Luckily for him I took out my cell phone and used my flashlight ap to assist him. He didn't even say, ""Thank you."" It was more like I was the worker helping another fellow employee. Unbelievable. Now the problem actually continues with the following: Our table was still wet and had ice cubes. The floor was extremely slippery and risked us from falling or any other patron for that matter. We continued to wait for our replacement water. Finally, it was brought to us. However, what happened to our utensils? Where were our napkins or towel cloth? It was never given to us and he expected us to sit there with our table all glossy--serving as a reminder, ""Oh. It's not over yet! Stay tuned for more!"" When our friends arrived we told them about what had happened. We then ordered our food and waited 40 minutes until our clam chowder arrived. Usually we'd receive it less than 10 minutes with our crackers. Well, that wasn't the case. Instead, we waited 40 minutes and only got our clam chowder while our friends looked at us eat. My girlfriend even stopped our server to ask, ""May I have crackers for my clam chowder please?"" Guess what? The crackers never came. It completely slipped the server's mind! After finishing our clam chowder our empty bowl just sat there until the very end of our dinner. Thank you very much for reducing my eating space!  Furthermore, all of our entrees finally arrived. Ah Yes. The moment of truth. Once again, my girlfriend had to remind the server, ""Can we have some towels and utensils please?"" I mean, I don't carry an extra pair of forks, knives and spoons with me. So please give us some utensils to eat. Don't tease us with our food sitting right in front with us!  Fast-forwarding to the end. We signed up for BJ's rewards program and were told by our server that tonight's dinner will be properly added to our rewards account. However, I found out this morning from checking online that the server had lied about it and only processed 1 of the orders. Thanks a lot for confirming your lie multiple times! I don't know if the guy was just being lazy our perhaps he was just downright incapable of addressing his patrons, but I'm very disappointed that not once did he offer to give us any freebie. Not once did any other worker or manager come out to address the broken glass and water all over our table and floor. Not once did the server sincerely say, ""Sorry."" Instead, it just felt like he was rushing to hide the issue before he got in trouble.  In conclusion, we did leave him a fair tip even with the horrible experience he has given the 5 of us there. My past experiences at BJ's were wonderful, but this server managed to screw up everything. I'm assuming the manager was never notified at all about what occurred. Therefore, our server probably just went to the backroom and got a broom to clean it up before anyone found out. How it should have been handled was that he should have notified his manager and requested to give us a free SOMETHING or for the manager to come out to say SORRY for the rather scary incident. But No. That didn't happen. Case closed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=420

But I think we overdid it and ate  a full meal again. We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip with tortilla chips. The dip was good. Cheesy and rich. The tortilla chips came in 3 different colors. Of course I ate the black and red chips and left the yellow ones for my friend lol. As we got to the chips on the bottom of the bowl, the chips just got really salty. I literally had to shake of every chip before eating it.  For our beers, We drank the nutty brunette beer. Pretty good beer, imo. It basically like a new castle but more bitter and darker. ( which means more alcohol and calories :D ) A whole pitcher gives us 4 1/2 pints. It has kind of like a sweet coffee taste to it. At first, I wasnt use to the taste of it because I'm so use to heineken, corona, and basically light beers. But after 2 cups, I actually prefer dark beer now since it gets me buzz quicker. For our dessert, we had the red velvet pizookie. I kind of had to beg my friend to get this for me because I am a big fan of red velvet ( i'm kind of sick of it now, but trying it as a pizookie is something I have to do! ) O M G soo freaking good. It was red velvet pizookie with white chocolate chips and vanilla ice cream on top *drrooolllsss* well it was kind of too sweet, but I love sweets so I didnt mind it.

The hostess couldn't even walk us to the dirty table she pointed to or even hand over a menu. We sat waiting for the server to come over and that never happen. So we sat observing the employees.

The hostess behind the desk was stacking people in the front area and not seating anyone! Not a single person! I would say at least 5 - 7 groups were waiting. My mom walked over to the desk and asked why is no one being seated? The hostess replied because we are waiting for a server to show up. Ummm NOT OUR PROBLEM! Finally a server showed up and went to clock in. Of course this new server had to talked to her friends before actually clocking in. Everyone waiting was just watching her knowing that we were all waiting for her! Finally, most of us were sat in her section which of course made our food coe out slower becuase 7 orders went in at once. I used to work in the restraunt business. When you get a rush, you open more sections and ask the servers to cover until the server for that specific section shows up.  I will say that once our server did show up, she was really nice and fast.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=440

We were seated right away, even though it was noon. Austin! was our waiter and he was pretty attentive. Gotta admit, though the food wasn't much above mediocre. Started with the appetizer combo. For $18.50 it should've been more than frozen mozzarella sticks and deep fried hot avocado egg rolls... ugh, nothing else in that egg roll, but hot avocado.There was a pizza & soup or salad special, so a couple of us got that. Salad was okay, just a regular garden salad. Tortilla soup was very good. Pizza was... not what I'd expected. 1 topping, pepperoni. It was personal sized, but I still expected more than 3 pepperonis. Also, part of the dough was raw. I ended up picking it apart to look for good pieces. One of my nieces just ordered water as her drink. She said it tasted like tap water. Considering how much we were spending, I think we should've gotten at least filtered water. The Pizookies were pretty amazing, especially the new cinnamon monkey bread one.

Emily S.,"Los Alamitos, CA",1,11,1,4.0,7/7/2014,"Their pizzas are delicious! For the most part, their service is great, too. My boyfriend and I recently purchased a pazookie to take with us to the beach. A warm, chocolate-y treat with a sunset was the perfect evening date. However, when we parked the car and peeled open our pazookie we were horrified! Baked inside were several stringy black hairs. It was especially disgusting because we had already taken several bites. :( We knew the hairs could not be ours because they did not match the color and texture. Our romantic date dessert was totally ruined! We immediately looked up online to see if they had a customer service number...they don't! Which is very strange. They do have an e-mail option, but we prefer to speak to an actual person. So we decided to wait until we went again (we previously went very often) to report the situation. We went last night had a nice server. After we paid for our meal, we finally worked up the nerve to ask for the manager (pretty shy, lol) The manager came out immediately. He was friendly, responsive and seemed like he really wanted to make sure we had a good experience. Totally loved him. After we explained what had happened he thanked us for returning, and offered not just me and my boyfriend but our other two friends coupons for pazookies. There was a catch, however. You have to purchase an entree in order to get one    -_- kind of a disappointment, as we usually just go to grab dessert lol. But overall I will be returning, and have not had any other problems at this location. There was a name on the back of the coupon that said Tom, so if that's the manager, special shout out to him for really taking the care to make sure we were happy. He has a true gift for customer service. I had kept the receipt in my wallet to show them, but he didn't even ask to see it, which I thought was really amazing. Their Santa Fe Spring Rolls are a great appetizer, we love their balsamic glazed chicken...and of course their pazookies!

We arrived around noon, and the place was empty except for about 2 other tables. The hostess tried to seat us at a table, which was too small for us.  We asked for a booth and she had to ASK permission to seat us in a booth.  She returned and moved us to a larger booth. We ordered beverages and our food and we received 3 drinks and the fourth was MIA. I think they had to go pick the coffee beans and grind them!!  We waited FOREVER for our food to be delivered.  By the time it arrived, the restaurant was full. I think our order sat in the kitchen the entire time while everyone else who arrived AFTER us placed their orders and received their food.  By the time we received our food, the three burgers were ice cold and the fries were barely warm. The fourth order, a sandwich, was room temperature.  We had to flag down our waitress to send our food back. SECOND TIME AROUND:  We waited and when two of he plates were delivered, they were lukewarm, again!  One of the burger plates came out and was ice cold and was immediately sent back.  One of the managers came over to apologize and give us the explanation that the burger was cold because the lettuce and tomato were ice cold, so that somehow prevented the patty from being hot....unbelievable!!  The food was still not hot, but we gave up, as we were not willing to wait any longer to eat.  The manager offered desserts to compensate for the poor experience, but we think that at least half the bill should have been comped.  By the time we got out of there, we had wasted 2 HOURS!!!

Lauren V.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,22,,1.0,10/5/2014,"Wow this was one of the worst experiences at a restaurant my family and I have had in a long time. We came to eat here last night for my nephew's b-day with a party of 13. This will be long so bare with me.. I'll start with our server: As soon as my sister asked her if we could have the dreaded separate checks, we detected attitude and much irritation.  She took our drink orders and then unbelievably asked us, ""can you find out what they want to drink over there?"" referring to the teens sitting at the end of our long table. Yeah maybe it had been a long night for her but really? You can't walk over there and ask yourself?? Like isn't that part of your job? Then when asked what kind of dressings they had for the salads, she replied ""just the normal dressings"".  Hmm normal dressings.. as opposed to abnormal dressings?  So we were done ordering, or so we thought, and then she asked my sister with a hefty dose of attitude: ""So wait I'm not really sure whats going on here, like, is your son sharing the pizza with you or is he ordering something or what?"" My sister replied that she already ordered his plate. It was just a wierd question, what does it matter if he was sharing the pizza or not, that's not the way a server should ask a question! At that point we felt uncomfortable and annoyed ourselves and we hadn't even eaten yet, so my sister got up and asked the manager for a different server. He apologized and agreed and a much more nice, genuine server came over a few mins later. But not long after, she was still coming to our table, but only the other end where the teens and a couple family members were sitting. She would bring a refill or clear plates but ONLY on that end. Strange. Why didn't the manager have her switch with someone else helping a different table or something? Nothing like making our dinner awkward now with her being overly fake-friendly on that end and walking by our end so fast and hastily that a breeze would blow by every time. Anyhow we wanted to have a nice dinner so we ignored it. Next I'll proceed with the douche-like behavior of the manager: Our brother in law was a little intoxicated and had the genius idea to give nephew who had just turned 16 a taste of one of his beers from a flight he ordered. As soon as we noticed we stopped him and told him he couldn't do that! After that we see the manager with arms folded standing there watching our table. So at that time we're tasting our pizza that came a couple minutes before and it is LUKEWARM, no wood-fired crusty taste, more of a bread consistency, and overall tasted like a frozen grocery store version of a BJ's pizza. Not to mention the 'seasoned tomatoes' on top were straight out of a can and looked disgusting. I know because my mom has bought those canned tomatoes before and there's no mistaking them.  Anyway back to the manager. Since he was standing there eyeballing us we asked if we could have the pizza heated up, he comes over and says sure and then quickly says something about how they do not allow underage and drinking and if WE do that again we all will have to leave. My sister explains WE had nothing to do with it and before she could say any more he rushed off. He was unfriendly from that point on, and service seemed to go down the toilet even faster. Not yet finished with our meal, we see the server coming over with the birthday ice cream scoop with candle on top. It was pretty obvious we were still eating and not quite ready for that moment yet. But I can only assume it was the manager's hint to rush us out of there since we all were guilty by association. The server set the dessert down and when asked if they sing happy b-day he said ""we don't do that here"". I felt like a dessert myself so I ordered the beignet with ice cream and strawberries. Again it seemed like the oven or microwave must've been broken because my beignet was a little tough and barely lukewarm. Ughh disappointing.. Not the dreamy dessert I remembered from last time. Here comes the final blow to a huge let down of a meal and service: We asked for the manager so we could clarify we had nothing to do with bro in law offering beer to teen and we quickly shut it down as soon as we saw it. At first he denied my suggestion that service took an even worse turn because of that, but then he acknowledged that 'it did alter his perception' whatever that means. He reminded us that he could've kicked us all out but he didn't, and when asked why the server who was rude still continued to come to our table, he said 'we all help each other out and this was her area to serve. Um ok.. then why agree to a new server??  He was very sarcastic, nothing on the bill was comped (not that that was our goal, but it's typical of a manager to do that to make up for bad service!), and continued to blame us all for one person's mistake. We all agreed he didn't have the balls to go up to the culprit himself and instead took it out on us ladies. Never again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=480

Shortly after we started eating we noticed that my wife didn't get any garlic bread with her pasta, so we asked the server and she said it didn't come with any even though it was in the picture on the menu.

Though, it gets really packed on a Friday so get ready for half an hour to an hour waiting.  Although by the time you get seated your table is going to be accommodated right away.. but be sure to have your order ready by the time server comes! (takes awhile to get your food) Got here @ around 8ish and it's really packed and there's a long line of waiting. Ordered the crispy calamari for appetizer & had myself a bowl of New England-style chowder and it was good though it was kind of salty for my taste.. For the main course, I had a slice of BJ's favorite pizza and it was really good! I got stuffed right away so had to take it home :) It was my birthday dinner so I had their personalize famous BJ's pizookie and it was the bomb! Too sweet though! Don't eat the whole thing! :D Everything is good! I wish I was 21 already because the bar sure looks great! They also have huge HD tv's all around the restaurant so you won't miss the lakers game or the football game!!

I moved over the avocado, and found it pretty easy to take off the tomatoes, the first bite of this salad was just mmmmm!! =) 0o0o before i go on...it was a giant potato!!! I was very amazed, stuffed with chili, which was really good, and you can totally taste the beer that was in it..i believe it was the piranha kind. Back to my salad, BJ's cobb salad is amazing. I love the fact that the lettuce is all chopped up, so when you grab a forkful of salad, you don't even see the ingredients hiding inside. The crunch of the lettuce, the kick from the ranch, then a hint of bacon..oh and whats this a cube of turkey comes into play! Ahhh delish!

Waited about 5 minutes until our server came to take our drink order. He took our order and about another 5 mins later he came with my bf's beer, just dropped it off..no eye contact...no telling me wtf he just put on the table...and he went to the table next to us to ask them how their food was. WTF.....I'm sure it doesn't take that long to give us some eye contact...just one second, and he couldn't do that.  Also, when he came with out food he saw that my water glass was empty, he told me ""I'll be right back with some water for you..."" When I finished my appetizer, the waiter came to pick up with dish ""Your glass is empty, I'll be right back to get you some water.."" Comes with my main dish ""I'll be right back to get you some water"". Yea...whatever....I never got my water btw. When my bf and I were done with our meal I was looking around the restaurant for our waiter. I literally was sitting there for 10 mins looking for him. He was nowhere to be found. We ask a random server and asked him for Frank (that was the servers name) and asked for the check. The server comes back with our check and said that Frank has left. WTF! If you are going to leave for whatever reason, find a replacement, let me know that you are freaken leaving.  I was so pissed off, I paid, left a dollar tip (that is considered generous). I walked straight to the manager and told her what poor service I got from Frank...and guess what...Frank was right behind her. Guess he took a long ass break and neglected his section.

The soup was good (as always), and came out hot. The Poki was extremely salty, as if it was just doused in soy sauce, and that was it. My pizza came out way late and warm to cold, so I wasn't too pleased. The crust wasn't crispy and the middle was cold and mushy. Boo. Our party was huge, but the servers were able to help each and every one of us to make sure our drinks were refilled and we got everything we needed.

Our bill was over $70 dollars for cold hard rice, a sliver of chicken and a half cup of salad. We left early before the desert. Yes we did try about four tasters of beer. I did snag a bottle opener key chain that I refer to as my $70 dollar keychain (they were giving them away) I wrote an email to the manager after but I guess it wasn't worth a reply. Honestly happy hour feeds and quenches our thirst for less. We use to come here at least twice a month...I guess I still have a bad taste in my mouth. They have my favorite beer on tap.

Joanna L.,"Los Angeles, CA",482,760,930,3.0,7/15/2012,"So instead of running 9 miles to burn 1000+ calories this evening, I went to dinner with my sister, her husband and babies and her in-laws to consume 1000+ calories....hehe So I have never been to a BJ restaurant and this is my first time here..for a party of 5 and 2 babies the wait was over 20 minutes apparently because a waitress came out and handed out small piece of pizza to us....this is apparently what they do when you have waited over 20 minutes...nice gesture. We finally got a table after another 10 minutes and even though I looked at the menu while waiting I almost couldn't make a decision because their gluten free thin crust pizza sounded safe...but they also had lighter options that I should eat but didn't sound as appealing to me.....therefore yes you guess it I ordered the Gluten-Free Thin Crust pizza with sausages, mushrooms, olives and roasted garlic accompanied by a sparkling raspberry lemonade. The food took about another 15 minutes to come out which felt pretty long because by this time I was pretty hungry. When my pizza came out I gobbled down the first slice pretty darn quickly...however the crust is super thin but not super crispy - it was still pretty good though. I ate about 3 slices and that's bout 126 calories per slice so it's not too damaging. However I did spot a Gluten-Free Pizookie and I heard that they are super good and BJ is known for it so I had to try it....my sister ordered this other baked dessert called the Baked Beignet and told me it's really good too.  So apparently they overbaked and burnt my pizookie which was a disappointed because it was really chewy and hard to scrape off the dish....it wasn't as good and it's not because it's gluten free because I have had gluten free cookies before and it wasn't this chewy and sticky. The baked beignet was okay - it's like a crepe - but this was baked and topped with strawberry sauce, strawberries and ice cream..it's actually quite sweet. not my typical choice for dessert...even the pizookie was just a little over the edge for sweetness for me but hey if you have a super sweet tooth then it's a perfect dessert.  Our waitress was pretty nice and overall it's okay....however I must say this must be a good place to go drinking or drink because the first few pages of their menu are all wines, beers and alcoholic drinks. not cheap ... maybe during happy hour?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=520

Frank E.,"Westminster, CA",220,4,1,3.0,3/26/2015,"after a long day of dealing with the agony of plugging the holes that my coworker left behind in the wake of an untimely and disgraceful political coup, all i wanted was to ease my sorrows with some cheap, greasy food and some drinks. I decided on BJ's, which is typically a safe bet for a simple combo of pizza and beer, but ventured out of the box slightly, similar to my newest slave drone, who is boxed into a void of pikerdom. My caesar salad arrived and I quickly felt my stomach turn the way it did just a few days ago, when the news of my wingman was dropped on me. have you ever received a caesar salad with american shredded cheese on top? no? because that's what I got. it reminded me of the frozen recycled salad bar at Chuck E Cheese, except with no pitcher of piss beer and skeeball to dull the pain. perhaps this appetizer portion of sliders would do the job. A few drinks later, I was stonefaced and ready for anything. but even though i asked for them with cheese and caremalized onions, I received literally just black meat and a cold bun with a shit squirt of ketchup and fossilized lettuce on the side. as I stared down at the comically tragic mess on my plate, I felt rage boil within my soul. to add insult to injury, I had to listen to the dick sponge waitresses gossip and hoot endlessly, a siren song that felt like a cheese grater on my tender brain. When I sent back the sliders, the final straw came, as one of the faceless broads, not knowing I was the one who sent them back, piked up and cheerfully squawked, ""oh I love the sliders! they're, like, the reason I work here!""

When someone places the order, they throw the toppings that were ordered on the pizza, put it in the oven for just a few minutes to let the cheese melt and serve. Why did it take me so many years to figure this out? This is the only logical answer. This has been an ongoing discussion for years with the group that I go to BJ's with.

Ailee F.,"Santa Ana, CA",176,144,7,3.0,9/16/2010,"3.5 stars I don't really get why this particular location always has a long wait. Most of the time I go there, the wait is like 1 hour long and we end up leaving to another restaurant or the other BJ's on Main St.  Everything is usually ok here, but that's kind of it. It's ok. The clam chowder is really good though, IMO better than Splash Cafe's in Pismo Beach. The BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich is also really good, but it's kind of huge, good for sharing I guess, I can't finish one of those things by itself.

Lychee W.,"Huntington Beach, CA",109,78,122,3.0,2/13/2012,"Bj's is a fun place to go with groups of friends. ok service, but yummy food. They have a good selection of beers and cocktails and definitely have great pizza.  I've been to this location so many times and every time I always end up waiting a really long time for service but every dish I've had was really good. It seems like they have a lot of servers but mine seems to disappear all the time and if I ask another server, they just say they'll get mine... My favorites would have to be any kind of pizza, chardonnay shrimp pasta, and the Parmesan crusted chicken and sweet onion strings with ranch as a side dish. Definitely always have to order a pazookie when I come here.

Christina S.,"Fountain Valley, CA",51,3,,2.0,3/8/2015,"Absolutely the WORST restaurant experience of my entire life. I came here with my family, 11 of us, for my moms birthday on a Sunday at 3pm. First we had a waitress who took our drink order, while half of the table received our drinks the other did not and then a 2nd waitress came who was taking over for the first waitress. She told us she would be our new waitress and that the other one was off but was starting our order since the new waitress had to go the bathroom :/. Gross. I did not want to think about my waitress using the bathroom ""for a while"" before she was getting my food. She then retook our drink order for those who weren't served yet. When she came back with drinks and started taking our food order she started complaining that she was waitressing at all since she was always in the bar serving drinks and that ""they decided hey she's here let's send her out to waitress for an entire room"" and told another table she'll get to them when she can and quietly said even if it does take me 20 minutes to get there. We ordered our food and a salad and an appetizer that she said she'd bring right out. The salad never came and the appetizer came with the food. But before it came we had another waitress change. This waitress was nice and good and the best by far. Before the other waitress left she told us our food will be right out only about 10 more minutes-we had already been waiting at least 20 minutes. The food finally came-2 of ours anyway. Then a couple minutes later they brought out 4 more plates and 3 of them were wrong. Wrong fries, no cheese on burger, no tomatoes on pizza. The fries were replaced quickly, the tomatoes took about 10 minutes, and the cheese never came. In the meantime 3 of us were still waiting for our food. We complained that the table was half way done with their food and the others hadn't even arrived. Finally another plate came out-wrong fries again. Also the gm came over to us. What a creep! My husband explained the situation and there was no apology, no rush, no movement from this guy. Instead he justified it saying that he was not another server ""just the general manager"" and was trying to make it better. My husband said just bring the food out so we can eat. He said I understand sir and we are working on that but in the meantime please understand we're working on it and doing what we can. All while leaning on a chair next to us wanting to debate rather than fix. I said just go get the food please we do t need a discussion. He stared at me with an asshole look stood up and rolled his eyes and turned and walked away while shaking his head. I said to my husband ""what an asshole"". He turned around and walked back over to us saying there was no reason for name calling and he did not appreciate that type of language in his restaurant. What?! My husband explained again how there were STILL 2 people waiting for their plates and he was MUCH more concerned with my ""name calling"" and needing to battle us. We literally had to tell him just please go and get our food-sternly. He left and came back with no food asking the people now what did you order that you're waiting for. So after they ordered again about 2 minutes later one plate came-wrong fries. We asked again for the right fries and the tomatoes. The tomatoes finally came the right fries never did. But the gm came back and asked the last person what they ordered, this was the 4th time she ordered. As he asked her I, in my husbands ear, quietly said he's taking her order again! He was STARING at me not even paying attention to her because he was so worried about what I was saying to my husband. He gave me a dirty look my husband told him to stop looking at his wife that way he then said ok and went to the end of the table to ask once more what she had ordered. She said just cancel it and shared with people at the table. He then went to the bar and was pointing us out-literally-to a guy sitting at the bar! A few minutes later he came back knelt down whispering to my mom who's birthday it was how she liked her food that she finally got and then told her that the entire tables bill would be covered. That was impressive considering his behavior before. But I feel he owed me and especially my husband the explanation since it was my husband he was dealing with and an apology. He never once apologized to any of us. The waitress did many times. She was great and we left her a BIG tip. He, even though waived the bill, was just so bad and uncomfortable. It was a very weird uncomfortable situation. He was extremely creepy in his manner. I seriously can not believe and have NEVER seen a manager behave and battle in the way he did. It was SO bad. The 2 stars are because the food is good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=560
Joshua H.,"Santa Ana, CA",76,53,21,4.0,9/26/2012,"I have to admit, most BJs get very crowded and the idea of bringing a big group is not the wisest, especially if there are sports events showing. But on numerous occasions i have called in for groups 9 people (if its bigger you will have to get a special reservations) and once I've arrived they have accommodated accordingly and sat us within 15-20mins during Sunday Football. I usually call in right before i get ready to drive, so that gives me like 20 mins of driving time. The management team here do what they can to please large parties. So feel free to speak to them if anything ever is needed or misunderstood. Here's a tip. Call in and put your group of 9 on the list, and then once you get there you can easily add 1-3 more people based on the section they put you in. It just depends on availability. Request the long tabled narrow section that has 2 designated tvs, (behind the hostess desk in the corner). Remember they will not usually allow you to call in a party of more than 9. So keep that magic number in mind. If you are waiting, remember the BAR is open seating and you can easily grab an open chair and drink a few beers while you wait. One last tip. During Football games, it is Happy Hour. So all mini Pizzas are half off and they discount Cocktails and appetizers.

The food is good, or at least the same as any other BJ's. My BIG complaint is the freshness of their ""guest"" beers. EVERY time I go I ask what the seasonal Sierra Nevada beer is and EVERY time it is a horribly out of date beer. Last night they had SN Celebration Ale, a winter beer that hasn't been distributed for at least 9 months.  The bev manager and the distributor obviously don't care about freshness.

I personally think the girl with the glasses placed us in a horrible section with babies screaming and such. The only good thing about this was our waitress was attentive. I don't blame the staff... I blame management. The manager should keep a check on their staff who is goofing off.

I and my husband got a glass of beer and cream soda for each. Waitress let my husband try some samples of beer which was super nice of hers. Cream soda I got was pretty nice. It was only $2.95 I think. Beer was $5.50 for a pint.    My husband got clam chowder and I got a salad. Clam chowder was really really good while my Caesar salad wasn't that good. We got a half of Five meat and another half of Sweet pig which was OK. I really liked the pizza from Old Chicago Where I used to go so much in Colorado. I wished it would taste like the Old Chicago one but it didn't. It is super heavy. I couldn't eat that much. I don't know why! maybe because of the thickness of bread??! Anyway I wasn't that crazy about Pizza. And We got a Pizookie which is just Cookie and ice cream on top. Waitress asked if we want half and half so we did with Chocolate chip and Red Velvet. It was reeeeeally goooooooood. I totally recommend it.  After having so much food and beer and stuff, my check was only around $30.  It was the first visit to BJ's and I really liked here.

I know most people review when they had a terrible experience (which isn't always fair to the restaurant), so I just wanted to give this review based on how the restaurant handles their customer service. I'm not really going to go into what went wrong, because that's not really that important.  It happens to the best of places.. but what matters is how they handled it.

Katie A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",39,4,,5.0,3/13/2014,"Okay, so I'm just going to flat out say that this BJ's is by far, THE BEST. I coach water polo at one of the local high schools and I needed a place to throw our end of the season banquet. I thought of Bj's immediately but had never done a restaurant before so I didn't know what I was getting into. I literally started out with a head count of 47 guests, which ended up to be about 67 people. I called their manager Tim C. probably a million times over the course of four weeks prior to the banquet. Our banquet was originally going to take place on the patio and then the head count was too many and I literally almost had a heart attack. I called Tim and he was able to move us to their bigger room and switch the smaller party that was booked in it to the patio. He was more than happy to email me the menu and the total price, plus the contract. Tim wasn't there during the night of the banquet but his other manager Dawn was there and she was fabulous. We ended up needing more seating and she immediately set up three extra tables and got our guests taken care of. She was there during set up, during the initial first two rounds of food going out, during the middle of the night she checked back again briefly, and then at the end she came by to make sure everything had went well. She made her presence known and it was comforting to know a manger was focusing so much on our party and its success. Kudos to management! We were able to order 4 deep dish pizzas, one pasta, and have a Cesar's salad. All the food was unlimited, as well as drinks. Cost $14.75 a person for the buffet menu and it cost a little extra for pasta but TOTALLY WORTH IT. The food was to die for!! I don't even know how many pizzas we went through or how many pounds of pasta, but my parents and kids were full.  I think the reason this night but I mean.... let's not forget about our service! I had three servers, one of them was Jamie and the other I believe was Trent. I feel so bad that I don't remember the last two names completely 100% but they were still amazing. They were funny and carefree. When I felt like I was going to have a meltdown from stress they were there to help out and were always checking on me and my guests. Jamie even cut the custom cake I brought in. I didn't even know they could do that! I was freaking out because I wasn't sure how to cut a cake and here comes Jamie like, ""Would you like me to cut your cake for you?"", is that even a question Jamie!? LOVED THE SERVICE. Trent was funny and joked around with the girls. His personality totally showed and he was very quick with drink orders and cleanup. At the end of the night, I know how hard those servers worked and I felt they deserved nothing less than 20% tip.  I was embarrassed that one of my parents was rude towards Jamie and I apologize profusely again. I appreciate the servers and all their hard work. This banquet would not have been a success if it had not have been for those servers. They busted there butts and they did it with smiles on their faces. I would not hesitate to bring my business there again. I STRONGLY encourage anyone looking for a banquet or large party venue to choose BJ's of Huntington Beach.

Lan N.,"Knoxville, TN",289,409,562,2.0,5/17/2010,"When I think of breweries, two factors come to mind: big portions and good beers. The food is okay and I really only come here for the beers. Not so much the food anymore because I always feel like a food coma after eating here.  They are known for their deep dish style pizzas, pizookies, and bar food. Service is overall okay. Actually, the service I had today in particular was very poor! Our original server had some sort of sniffle while taking our orders. When our server changed to another girl, she was not giving us a time of day. Probably because 3 out of 4 from the table had ordered the unlimited soup and salad lunch special. I had ordered the chicken tenders with wedge fries. My dish was pretty good. Better than your KFC chicken tenders. Then again, chicken tenders are just chicken tenders. Nothing really special. Although my hefeweizen complimented my meal very well. As for the lunch special...not so special. You get to choose from different soups: clam chowder, broccoli cheese, chili, minestrone, and tomato basil bisque. The salad you can choose from house salad (basically ice berg salad mix from the bag) or the caesar (which i would recommend over the ice berg).  The best soup to have is the tomato basil bisque.

Allison M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,24,11,2.0,6/29/2015,Had my bridal shower here Sunday in a private (sort of) room as you walk in. Beware that it is extremely hot in there. ( only fans since you're not inside the building). To start the tables were set and I was impressed with that. However we had specifically requested that only brunch be able to be ordered and me and a worker had to turn the pages in a hurry. My mom planned the shower and was told there was no time limit when she asked. They had her give a final headcount two weeks prior and still no warning of a time limit. The staff though lovely and nice weren't really looking at the clock and managing the group very well. It felt like they cared more about ringing up the mimosa bill vs giving us actual food. Most people liked their food by the time we got it however some got half scrambled eggs and microwaves potatoes. I get that brunch isn't their speciality but it really was unfortunate. With the clock nearing 1245 a group came in with balloons and the manager warned us we had 15 minutes left. Something the guests and myself weren't prepared for. I definitely wouldn't recommend having any sort of event here if you can't fit everything in 2 hours. With having people arrive late and socialize it's not enough time to settle down eat and not be rushed.

The rice tasted buttery and there were small chunks of chicken, sausage and shrimp, but just not enough of it. For almost $16 I expected more bang for my buck. I also got a dinner salad for $2.95 but the salad size was pretty petite. It would great for people on a diet.  Overall a mixed bag. I like the cleanliness and vibe of this place. And the service was excellent. I think their food is overpriced for you get.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=600
Kendahl S.,"Nashville, TN",54,7,8,2.0,1/20/2014,"While the food is always consistent at all Bjs, the experience we had with the service did not seem up to par with the rest of their locations. After being seated we waited approx. 10minutes just to be greeted (no order taken) and was told she'd be back after dropping off dirty plates- however when she came back she still attended to two other tables prior to coming back to us to take our order.  Once we received our food there was no table touch from her and we waited for 20minutes looking around to try to get our check.  In that time period I even watched her service one table even though another one was sat before them at least 7minutes prior.  I ended up asking the manager to get us our check - I tried explaining to him that our service wasn't up to par and that our server needed to manage her tables better, and while he was apologetic he made me feel like he didn't necessarily want to hear it/deal with it.   This was in the bar area so maybe the service is better in the dining room- I do have to say the hostess was very sweet upon our arrival- ill still go back because I enjoy the food and the overall ambience of the restaurant- it was just an unfortunate experience this time around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=600

Samantha L.,"San Francisco, CA",676,953,2058,3.0,7/30/2009,The food at BJ's disappoints me. I always go in expecting greatness but always leave like my meal lacked something.  The only thing that I enjoy there is their LUNCH SPECIALS! $5.95+ for a lunch deal :) score! Most of their common entrees are included in this lunch special.  Today i had a Caesar salad + pepperoni personal pizza for $5.95 and tax. I asked them for ranch on the side and they provided great service! The pizza is yummy!! It's the perfectly sized deep dish pizza for one person. SO JUST COME HERE FOR LUNCH but otherwise I think some of their dishes are lacking. You can make pizookies at home!! But BJ's is also a good place to celebrate a birthday with both your 21+ and underaged friends and family. There's a bar and plenty of alcohol! AND it's a restaurant for families so they don't kick anyone out or restrict any under-aged people in after a certain hour.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=600

I came here during a lunch hour, grabbed the pager and was told that there was a 20mins wait. The pager goes off and I turn it to the front desk and wait by the side for someone  to seat us. There's two servers waiting for people! The girl at the counter is confused but this whole time in waiting to be seated, nobody says ""it will be just a few minutes"" or even look at us. I watched two groups of people AFTER me turn in their pager and get seated. No one says anything to me. Finally the girl at the counter looks up and I look at her kind of annoyed asking what's going on. She seems pretty frazzled and says, ""OMG, I'm so sorry!"" And I tell her I watched two groups of people get seated immediately while I had to stand there and wait while everyone ignored me. Not that it was intentional, but the server was about to take our orders and threw her pen at me for some reason.

Jessica G.,"Los Angeles, CA",61,29,4,3.0,2/6/2012,"This review is for the late night happy hour only! Tip: sit at the bar! The bartenders are great talkers, know a helluva lot about beer, and will remember your favorite drinks when you come in often. I usually hit up BJ's after I work at my serving job. The beer is cold, the drinks, are stiff, and the company is a perfect compliment.  Late night happy hour eats are what they are: skimpy portions for a cheap price, but what else do you expect for everything 5 dollars and under?. I usually get the tomato, basil, and mozzarella salad. It's delicious and they will add some romaine in there if you ask nicely to bulk it up a bit.  My friend usually orders the ahi poke which is sashimi grade tuna diced up with avocado and served with fried wonton chips. I've also tried the spinach artichoke dip, salsa, potato wedges, and chicken tenders. All solid, bar food options.  During happy hour it can get a bit busy, so keep that in mind.

Thuy L.,"Orange County, CA",1662,504,3914,3.0,5/13/2011,"2.5 stars... I'm sorry BJs.. you used to be much better... =(  Every time I go here with my friends we always get the same table.. it was 3 out 3 times we sat at this table. It's the first table on your right, right behind the hostess.  The service seemed a bit slow here last night even though they weren't that busy... We ordered everything to share with everyone so I got to taste a bit of everything but here was what we ordered: For drinks most of us ordered the Strawberry lemonade but the lemonade was the bottom of the batch so it was very watered down. By the time they came around to give us refills(which is when almost everyone's drink was almost empty) she said she was going to get us refills but 10 minutes later, she comes out and says that they are making a new batch of strawberry lemonade so they gave us the homemade lemonade. =( -Ahi Poke - the portion got a LOT smaller now.. I was very disappointed when it came out. check it out:   that is TOTALLY not a shareable appetizer. it was so tiny! The flavor was okay. I have had better. The picture in the menu just looked soo good, what a trickery.  -Calamari -   portions were small also.. I remember when they used to make these SHAREABLE appetizers shareable. False advertisement  is what I think. - Crispy artichoke - I liked this dish. It came out piping hot - Shrimp pasta dish but I forgot what it was called but here is what it looks like:   This dish was pretty good. The shrimp were very plump and yummy -  Blacken Salmon Santa Fe Salad - Pretty good. The salmon was yummy but then I love salmon so you can't really mess it up. Here is a picture:   I really need to get a real camera and take real pictures.. LOL - Crispy Chicken Salad - MY FAVORITE!   I love the corn, eggs, cucumber and almonds mixed in with it. The sauce is addicting also! - something pizza   LOL. I didn't feel like eating pizza so I didn't really pay attention when they ordered it but they liked it.

Beth H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",279,300,151,4.0,5/3/2011,"I have to admit...I was going to drop my previous 3 stars down to 2 after BF and I went for dinner and I had the fish and chips....greasy, greasy, greasy.... However, between the time I was ready to write my updated review and today, when BF and I tried BJ's for lunch, things have changed dramatically. See, BJ's has this new part to their menu named, ""New Flavors"". BF and I were trying to keep our calorie count low so we decided on the Chicken a la Fresca and the Creole Tilapa so we could share. About 20 minutes after ordering the head chef/kitchen manager came out and said they were still working the kinks out and that the rice pilaf would be another 10+ minutes. However, he could substitute. BF and I jumped at the chance for fresh, mixed veggies, despite the fact that I had to get back to work. When the plates came, they were literally a work of art. I personally liked the tilapia better and BF liked the chicken better but neither was here nor there. They were both really nice, well seasoned, flavorful sauces and fresh veggies, cooked to that perfect crisp/tender. We had several people, including the same head chef/kitchen manager come out and ask us how we liked the dishes. Basically, I would have the fresh veggies in lieu of the rice pilaf. I know I haven't had the rice pilaf but I love fresh veggies. Because of this New Flavor menu and the fact that I tried two of the new items on it and really enjoyed them both, your drop to two stars ended up to a raise to four stars BJ's. Keep it up!

The food is not bad, but nothing is really stellar there are plenty of pizza places around without the the problems that this BJ's has. The service here is awful. The hosts are rude and ignore you in favor of talking to each other. The takeout cashier is similarly rude. We came in to pick up our order 20 minutes after ordering it as they instructed and still had to wait another 15 and it could have been longer, we approached after 15 minutes to inquire about our order, the girl said rudely ""it's coming"" like we were being unreasonable in wondering were our food was after 35 minutes, but the guy behind her apparently had it packaged because he nudged her and then she told us it was actually ready. The servers are usually very slow to get to the table, slow to bring out the drinks and your lucky if they get back soon enough to see if you need anything with your meal. I ordered a Guinness and some other sever brought it out and nearly half of it was head. I didn't touch it and waited a good 10 minutes for the server to get back to the table to ask for a new one to be poured correctly she acted really annoyed that I want to have a proper pour.  I'm paying 6 dollars for a beverage I do expect it to be right.

Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love deep dish pizza and wouldn't mind eating it for the rest of my life if fat was no object. The spinach and artichoke pizza, though, tasted like ranch with some incidental pizza below it. Creamy to an absolute fault, it reminded me of watching people grudgingly eat ""salad"" -- under thick layers of fatty dressing and bacon bits. The menu promised lots of spinach, but we instead got more artichoke than spinach--also disappointing. It's really a shame, too, because the pizza crust is irresistibly crispy. The macadamia nut pizookie was predictably good, but a little too fatty. It would have tasted just as good, imo, with some leaner ingredients in the cookie dough. The small microbrew (they wouldn't serve me a pint and just brought a 12oz, huh?) was a decent take on the Lost Coast White Ale. Total came out to nearly $30 with tax and tip.

Always found it cool that somehow ketchup at restaurants always seem to be fULL , guess not at BJs got a few funny noise squirts but very little stuff so had to wait and ask for more not to mentions n that my tea was dry so much of the time.

Boyfriend order a bacon cheeseburger and side salad and I got the avocado egg rolls and gourmet Mac n cheese. Salad arrived first and it was smaller than expected but the plus side it didn't arrive with tomatoes. Food arrived and my egg rolls were made with brown avocado and a hint of greener looking ones. Food overall tasted good just visually with the avocado egg rolls not particular please to see more brown than green. Server checked up on us periodically asked if we wanted a pazookie and we declined and he immediately handed us our bill and said no rush.

Tyrell H.,"Bellflower, CA",6,3,1,1.0,1/18/2015,"I went there yesterday with a friend for lunch after shopping and it was pretty much bad from the time we walked in the door. We walked up and asked to be seated and the manager and the host were basically arguing about where to sit us. I'm guessing they didn't want to since they just assumed we wanted to be in the bar. We had to tell them both that we did not want to be seated in the bar. After their show we got seated the server was quick to bring the things we ordered but not to be found between. We waited a very long time to receive our food and when we got our plates. The rice on both out plates was hard aka Half Cooked. We didn't eat and we got our food to go. The server dropped off our check and disappeared we waited a few minutes then we just walked up and asked the manger if she could split out check for us because we were both paying with our cards. ... This evil woman rolled her eyes and iad okay  so I told her what was mine and what was my friends and she said oh no. I'll split it down the middle. That was not okay because I spent more money than my friend on purpose knowing I would pay for it. But she did not care. So then I asked her what we would each be paying and she says I don't know between 24 and 30 dollars. And I asked her the exact amount and she again rolled out her eyes and took out her phone to give us our totals then I take10$ out of my pocket and tell her to use that and charge my card for the rest. She gives my card and my cash to the server and told him she didn't know what the cash was and told him it was his tip and he walked away and she said ""is that all""  I never said anything to her while I was there because it would have been really ugly. I think what I asked for was pretty simple and I don't think the manager at this location is good for the company I have been eating at bjs for years and this was by far the worst. I could have gone to Denny's for that service I don't understand how we waited an hour and got terrible service and halfcooked food.

It was already 9 pm by now.  So we ordered a couple of pizookies; no big deal, right?  Shouldn't take too long.  The kids did have school the next day, but how long could it take?  35 minutes later, 5 minutes after I requested they cancel the pizookies, the waitress brings them out at last.  The kids were yawning and falling asleep, but their eyes lit up at the pizookies, so we let them enjoy and headed home around 10.  The worst thing was - and the waitress knew we were upset with the situation about the heaters and the entire wait - no apology, nothing.  Just ""Have a nice night.""  Very disappointing.  BJ's.  Really?  Never going back to this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=720

I like their selection of their own beers, especially the harvest hefeweizen. I kind of wish they had other beers like Blue Moon or something, but I understand that they got their own thing going on.  What I look forward to each time I go here isn't the beer or the pizza, but the effing pizookies. mmm, a big ol chocolate chip cookie with ice cream on it.

I always get tired of it after half the cookie, but man, my mouth is watering right now just thinking of it.  I really like this restaurant and the wait has never been much of an issue, but I can't give it five stars because I like Yard House a little more. Especially the Fashion Island location.  But another upside is that I've been to a wedding rehearsal party and an engagement party here and they do a really good job bringing out pizzas and closing of a section of the restaurant for us. It's intimate enough and I like having BJs pizza served buffet style.

Kimmy L.,"Huntington Beach, CA",34,108,89,3.0,12/27/2009,"I come here occassionally with friends and it's really an all American brewery house. It's got American food with an exception of a few Asian dishes and it's not bad. It's not the best but when you're looking to hang or meet up friends, it's conveniently there. It's not my first choice but that is just a matter of preference.  In terms of food, I always enjoy a pazookie in my group and sometimes I really like ordering some hot fries etc. I'm mostly into the snacks and junk food that I feel go with beer. I've ordered a  sampler before with my friends but there is no preference or reference because I've had better.  But this place still keeps a good tradition of brewing their own beer.

We left VERY HAPPY customers. I do have to comment on the 'Party for 2' deal. I've taken advantage of this deal 2 times this month...both times it seems like they skimp on the food. Most importantly, the Pizooki (sp?) was so thin...not like they normally are when we pay full price. Seems like they would save just a few pennies doing this, not worth a possibly unhappy customer.

I came here for a friends graduation from college at around 9:30pm with a party of about 10 people. After we were seated, service couldn't have been better. We were even paired with TWO servers for a period of time which made things go more quickly and efficiently. We were given plenty of service and was so impressed here.

Happy Hours are Monday thru Friday from 3-7pm. $1 off appetizers and draft beer at the bar and mini pizza specials. This location does get pretty jammed pack but I have always been extremely lucky enough to find an empty booth at the bar every single time. The bartenders work with you to get the best drinks made, and their food is awesome! I definitely recommend the following dishes: Appetizers *Sante Fe Rolls - The crispy spring rolls filled with tender chicken, fire-roasted red peppers, sweet corn, jalapenos and cheese served with a Santa Fe dressing and avocado cream sauce. Make sure to ask for extra sauce! *Chicken Wings - A pound of crispy, deep fried tender chicken wings drizzled with hot sauce. Finger licking good!   Main Dishes *Work Deep Dish Pizza - You got meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, black olives and seasoned tomatoes on top of a deep dish crust. Make sure you get a side of ranch. The pizza is extremely hearty and tasty! *Sante Fe Salad - The salad is topped with jack and cheddar cheese, avocado, corn, tomatoes with blackened chicken breast topped with Sante Fe dressing. The salad really complimented the pizza. Dessert *Pizookie - Freshly, baked Chocolate cookie topped with 2 scoops of vanilla bean ice cream. It's UNBELIEVABLE!! On Tap Depend on my mood and type of girl that I am into that day.  I recommend the Porter (dark and smooth), Jeremiah Red (Irish malts), or your typical Blonde.

Its probably one of the best bro cheese soup I have ever had. It is never watery ! Always consistant !  Service is ok, it just depends if they are super busy or not.

Steve T.,"Orange County, CA",327,198,141,4.0,5/23/2011,"Usually on weekdays I would only eat 2 meals a day, while in between it would be a protein shake after the gym. One night it was already 8pm and I haven't had my 2nd meal so I decided to head to Bj's for a Small Meal. Spinach & Artichoke Dip: 4/5 Baked to perfection. Very Rich and Cheesy. The tri-color chips that accompany it was enough to finish the Dip. However you may want to hold off the salt, they sprinkle a little too much on ours. We literally had to shake off each one unless you love salt. Nutty Brunette Beer: 4/5 What's chips N dips without some house brewed beer right? This beer was dark and slightly bitter comparable to a New Castle. The price for the pitcher was $17.95 not easy on the wallet. However it comes out to be at least 4 1/2 pints of beer not too shabby when you put it that way. My friend just started drinking dark beer she the nutty. Red Velvet Pizookie: 4/5 If you have eaten at BJ's you know its not a complete visit without a chocolate chip pizookie. Well now they also offer a Red Velvet one. Its of course freshly baked when you order it. It taste like authentic red velvet flavor and the ice cream is good as ever. So a small meal here made me $30 lighter in the wallet... *****Note***** Parking is Horrible here, if you are planning to eat with a big group you should really look into carpooling. And if its a ""small"" meal you planning to eat dont bother wasting your time here.

Richard T.,"Fountain Valley, CA",299,137,59,4.0,11/20/2010,"BJs has all around good food and good beer. It's popular for its brewed beers on tap and their Chicago-style deep dish pizzas, oh and their pizookies, but their other food is quite delectable as well.   Usually my buddies and I go for a late night happy hour which isn't much but every dollar saved helps avoid an overdraft fee. The happy hour starts at 10 and I think it's a dollar off beer and $2 off appetizers? I might be mistaken but like I said it isn't outstanding. However beware! It only applies to the people sitting in the bar area, so the HH doesn't apply everywhere else. That's how they get you! Anyway, I highly recommend the Beer Sampler that comes in 7, 8oz. glasses of beer ranging from the darkest beer to the lightest beer. Not only do you get to try the 7 different house beers on tap, but it always gets me a really good buzz. Trust me, I go out and I drink a lot, and usually its hard A, but whatever they do to the beer boy it sure tickles your brain.  I never really eat the pizza here only because I hate to eat heavy, so i stick with the appetizer menu instead but everything I've had on there is good. I recommend: -Chicken Wings: OMG sooo good! Crispy skin, juicy meat, perfectly seasoned.  -Spinach & Artichoke Dip: Cheesy Goodness, sensational flavors! -Nachos: Perfect for a small group of 3. Its huge and it comes with mounds of different toppings including beans, sour cream, ground meat, guacamole...I'm getting full just thinking about it.  -Tomato Mozzarella Salad: Wowwww its under the mini menu but its a really refreshing salad for only $2.95! Its a great starter before all the food and booze starts entering your system. -Cant decide? Then get the Appetizer Sampler Plate (I forget the legit name but its on the top) it comes with mozzarella sticks, avocado egg rolls, spinach and artichoke dip, santa fe spring rolls, etc. It's quite tasty.  I enjoy going here mainly because its a nice place to just chill with a couple of your buddies, sip on some beer, eat some food and chit chat about life's ongoing pleasures.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=680

We arrived just before 7 PM and were immediately seated.  10 minutes later, our server acknowledged our arrival.  We ordered drinks and they arrived a few minutes later. (Good so far). We placed our dinner order.  (Way too dark to read the menus) Less than 10 minutes later our entre's, not our salads, arrived.  I informed the server that we were expecting our salads first to which he replied ""I'll put these under the warmer and get your salads"". I said, that is not going to happen.  We ordered fresh foods and I do not want ""warmer food"".  He said ""I'll talk to the manager"". I said No, bring our salads and remake our food.  He scurried off.  I pulled our waiter aside and explained to him what had happened...  Salads arrive, with no silverware, and less than half way through it, look what comes around the corner...the dinner!  Yup, you guessed it, straight from the warmer!!  To shorten this up: the hostess found her texting to be more important than bringing the water she promised, the waiter didn't come by for a while and after his 3rd trip past, brought the water, placed the order for dessert, but was prompt with the check!!!   As we sat watching, tables were unbussed, the man at the table next to us was served an improper burger, and another table went ignored!

I hadn't gone in months and so when the Fam wanted to go out for dinner I naturally suggested Bj's.  They hesitatingly made a reservation for my party of 8 (had to involve the manager) despite their automated system saying reservations were taken for parties of 7 or more.... If your system says 7 or more you need to accept 7 or more and not give me crap for it. Upon arrival ten minutes before our reservation time at 7pm we check in and got our buzzer. At 7:45 we were still waiting to be seated!!! what is the point of making a reservation if you make us wait over 45 minutes!! Terrible. The wait should be 15 minutes max. It took TWO complaints and a Manager to get our party seated. Once seated our sweet server took care of us. Unfortunately the food runners messed up the rest of the evening. They kept bringing out the wrong food (2X) and ended up taking my Mothers order to another table. The manager had to come over and apologize offered her a free soup or salad while the kitchen remade her food. The entire table had their dishes except her..... one thing after another man... I will say this the manager was quite amazing in fixing her staffs mistakes. She seemed genuine in her concern and fixed each issue as promptly as possible.

We almost always order a BJ's Favorite Deep Dish which is always delicious and salads to start. We have ordered different entrees from the menu when we don't feel like pizza but the problem lies with our salads. Not once, not twice, not even three times, but FIVE different times, they have brought the salads and the pizza at the same time so our pizza sits there and gets cold, they bring the salads out approximately 2-3 minutes before our meal comes out so we have just started to eat our salads and then our food just sets there getting cold once again OR they have just forgotten our salads all together! I don't get it, how hard is it to make a salad?! I have spoken to the manager several different times about this problem and he or she almost always takes care of the bill or something on the bill but still, I came for a relaxing meal, i should not have to worry about rushing through my starter bc my meal is sitting there getting cold! In fact we went there last night, and we waited about fifteen minutes for our salads and about a minute after we got them our food came, so once again epic fail on the service. Get it together BJ's, the only reason why I give two stars is because I like their food! As we were leaving last night my husband said if we really want to eat at BJ's we will go to the one on Main St., it is just so in inconvenient because we live right around the corner from this location.

Cool thing that happened was while I was waiting, the waitress brought samples of slices their deep dish pizza and let me tell you IT WAS DELISH!  Our server was nice and friendly no complaints. She did the usual check up and refilled frequently, so service was grand and she was pretty a were her fellow co-workers :) Upon ordering I started off with there big plate of chicken caesar salad ($12.95) which was good nothing fancy I mean you have to be culinarily uninclined to mess up a simple caesar salad. Next, I was tempted to order a deep dish pizza after my flavorful sample, but I was curious and my eyrs wandered the menu through and through and finally settled with a Cajun Shrimp Jambalaya. It was my first time eating jambalaya and it was a good first experience, however I wouldn't order it again only bcuz its not my style. Dont get me wrong it was a good size portion, they weren't sheisty with the shrimp and it had a nice kick to it, but I just thought it was ""ok"", nothing special.  My girlfriend, however, ordered the Chardonnay Shrimp Pasta. BOMB DIGGITY! Served on a huge plate so there is potential for leftovers as is the jambalaya. Also, they did not hold back on the shrimp. I'd recommend it. They sauce was supremely delectable and the chardonnay gave it a nice broth-type blend.  I would definitely order this second time around. Last but not least, where do I begin, oh yes, the PAZOOKIE!!! My mouth produces excess saliva just thinking about it. Hands down, thee best dessert I have ever had and will not hesitate to order even if I am super stuffed. TRY IT!

Keep in mind I'm the only person in my group who was freaked out by this and when I started laughing at the end of the meal everyone thought I was an asshole. There were 6 people in our party. My girlfriend, her mom, her moms boyfriend, her sister, her little brother and myself. Waitress came and took our drink orders and a little while later took our food orders. I asked for a mini pizza and a side of fries, girlfriend got some pasta with a side salad, her mom got some giant salad, her boyfriend got something that I cant remember and both of her sibling got small pizzas for themselves. About 20 minutes goes by and a small plate of fries is placed on the table. I know they're mine but nobody else seems to know that so now my side of fries has become an appetizer for the entire table. Another 10 minutes pass (fries are gone) and they bring my girlfriend her pasta. Another ten minutes pass and they bring her mom her giant salad. Anther 10 minutes and I get my pizza, another 10 minutes and moms boyfriend gets his food, another 10 minutes and my girlfriend gets her side salad. My girlfriend and her mom were both done with their meals before brother and sister even got their food. I'm finding this whole thing comical so I start to chuckle and point out the absurdity of it which is met with puzzled looks and a ""whats so weird about the service?"" from the mother. A little while later the sister gets her pizza and about 5 minutes after that the waitress brings the brothers pizza to the table and asks ""who had the bbq chicken pizza?"" and after the brother raises his hand and says ""me"" the waitress still served it to the sister (who had a whole pizza right in front of her). I let out a very audible chuckle and the waitress looks at me funny. So, now we're in an awkward moment because everyone is done with their meals except for my girlfriends brother and sister who have just started eating so we decide to order some desert to share so that they don't feel like we're all just staring at them while they eat. Waitress comes and takes our order (we got two pazookies) and I swear to god not 5 minutes later she brings us our bill and tells us to have a good day. Our pazookies are still like 15 minutes away from being out of the oven and we're already being shooed away from our table. I don't know if it was just a messed up kitchen, lack of staff or what but I was so amused by the whole thing that when the waitress dropped off our bill I was pretty much just laughing in her face uncontrollably.   the pazookies were delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=740

Drivingcrzy D.,"Huntington Beach, CA",13,29,18,4.0,10/14/2010,I have never had a bad experience when eating at BJ's. I think its the best pizza around in Huntington beach. I think everyone in the world has had a PIZOOKIE and knows its the best thing in the world. If you haven't had one yet just go to BJ's for a pizookie and you will be in heaven.  Cant wait to eat here again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=740
Eman S.,"Buena Park, CA",146,19,7,1.0,4/17/2014,"I love BJ's I really do, but this location is lacking. We walked in (a group of 3) and didn't even get greeted at all. When I went up to the hostess and asked for a table for 3 she said ok and out of nowhere a random lady walked by and said hi and apparently she was supposed to take us to our seats but she didn't even tell us to follow her or anything so we were standing around all confused. When we got seated we waited an entire 10 minutes until the waiter came up to us to take our order for our drinks. Thank goodness we were ready to order or else we would've been there all night! So this waiter comes back 15 minutes later with our drinks and no food. At this point my hungry side is coming out. We waited another 30 minutes until we smelled our food. Now that we had our food, my friend decided to ask for a side of ranch. The waiter (who we only saw like 3 times the whole time) nods his head and never comes back. So another 8 minutes pass by and another waiter walks by and we ask him for the side of ranch. I guess he also ignored us too. We were on our last slice of pizza when the ranch came out. It was such a slow and annoying experience that we decided not to order the pazookies and I love those things. After this terrible experience we talked to the manager who really did listen and feel bad and she took care of us. All in all I will never visit this location again, I'll go to other BJ's before I go to this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=740

Kim S.,"Hawaiian Gardens, CA",20,7,,1.0,9/27/2012,"Don't make reservations in advance. Even though the wait is short, you are dumped in the exterior patio with no A/C and no fans above your table while it is 91 degrees. Be prepared for excuses if you asked to be moved to a cooler area. We were told we would have to be placed on the waiting list again for about ""20 minutes"" until another table becomes available. The manager that came over was useless as he stood there without saying a word. Wouldn't you know it... 5 other tables were available. And if you ask for splenda  expect some generic sugar or the following response from your server ""I might possibly forget your splenda again, but if I do please remind me again"". WTF? I originally had 2 stars, but as our dinner went on, the service got worse. Food that wasn't ours was delivered to us, we were given no plates with our pizza, we had to repeatedly ask for the same refill at least 3 times, we had to ask for the same dirty dishes to be removed several times, the kids had to wait 12 minutes for their dipping sauces, the order was brought out wrong (even at the neighboring tables), we received thin crust pizza instead of hand tossed, the kids received their food about 10 minutes after the adults and we were asked to continuously serve others at the table because the server couldn't do it herself.

James D.,"Huntington Beach, CA",16,25,5,2.0,7/5/2013,"I don't set the bar high when I go to BJ's but tonight was ridiculous. It started by being told the wait would be 25 minutes. Ok. It's Friday night. 45 minutes later (and after before being told that we were next and seeing three parties seated) we finally got a table. My daughter and I split a calamari appetizer and I wonder if half of it was fully cooked. The batter on several pieces was still doughy.  While we ate our calamari, my wife's garden salad came out, with balsamic dressing.  She ordered balsamic vinegar and oil.  After getting over the fact that a garden salad at BJ's is iceberg lettuce, two slices of tomato, shredded carrots, and croutons, my wife asked for the balsamic vinegar and oil she had originally ordered.  What came from the kitchen? Balsamic vinegar and rice vinegar.  What cook can't tell vinegar from oil?  After waiting several more minutes for a check in from the waitress, my wife asks for olive oil and gets it a few minutes later with the comment from the waitress, ""it sure is hard to find olive oil in the place."" The oil tasted like it had been sitting out for a week or so. My bison burger came out (inconsistently cooked from well to medium from one side to the other) and cole slaw (think shredded cabbage with a dollop of ""dressing"").  Good thing we had the rice vinegar; I added it to my shredded cabbage to make slaw.  The delivery guy (not our waiter) also brought out some pasta dish, ""Tuscan Chicken Limon"", but my daughter had ordered ""Texas Style Chicken Fried Steak.""  Yeah, they sound the same.  Ten more minutes for her dish to be delivered.  We got a line from the waitress that she put in Chicken Fried Steak and she didn't know what was going on in the kitchen but our check reflected the ""Tuscan Chicken Limone.""   My wife ordered ""Maui Glazed Pork Chop"" with red potatoes that needed to be re-hydrated.  Warning, the glaze is spicy! At least we got a free pizookie out the deal but there was no apologetic attitude associated with the offer.  I guess mediocrity is par for the course at BJ's.   While we ate, a man and woman with their child in a stroller paid and left.  Immediately, two young, attractive, scantily clad girls sat down at the table before it had even been bussed. One got up to get menus from the front desk while a busboy ran over to bus the table. Almost immediately thereafter, the (apparent) manager was squatting in front of the table smiling, chit chatting with the girls.  I expected the waitress to blow them off, but no, she too had a conversation with them. I guess they worked there.  I was shocked that an establishment would let this sort of behavior stand when customers were patiently waiting for a table.  In the time it took us to get our check and pay, the girls had no less than 2 busboys, one waitress, the (apparent) manager and (apparent) assistant manager at their table, appetizer, drinks, and entrees delivered.  If BJ's doesn't think customers notice this sort of behavior, they're wrong. As we left, I counted three parties of 2 and one party of 6 waiting by the door. The night ended as we left the parking lot and had to dodge a BJ's employee running out the door in uniform, lighting up a cigarette, through a group of customers with children, into the parking lot. Did I mention the waitress and busboy wandering the floor texting? I don't think we'll return to BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=620

The salads are plain, all made with iceburg lettuce, no baby green salads so it almost seems you are eating the same salad just with different dressing.  The cheese pizza was not as spectacular as I would expect since it is their name sake.   On the other hand, the food was very affordable, $6.95 for the soup and salad combo and $6.25 for the salad and pizza combo. The inside is nice and clean and the service was good.

I'm not going stop going to BJ's because of the service but I do think they need to work on being a little more on the ball and efficient.  We have been to other BJ's in Cerritos and Montebello and they are pretty much all the same when it comes to the service.  As I said, the food is excellent and I really enjoy their enlightened menu so I won't stop going but we just have to realize that service is not their strong point.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=620

Ha, not the obvious answer of pizza right?! Came here for a girlfriend's birthday dinner last week and started it off with a nice cool glass of Jeremiah Red.  Jeremiah Red has a great color, crisp taste and goes down smooth! I split a pizza (couldn't remember what kind, had too many Reds, haha) and a salad with my sister and I was good to go. Kept the beer flowing through to dessert which was a trifecta of pizookie!!! If you haven't had this, you gotta do it. Nice warm cookie all nice n' doughy under a scoop of ice cream. My one complaint? My spinach dip n' chips came with crumbs of chips! What's up with that?! How am I supposed to eat the dip with chip crumbs?! I was too friggin hungry to send it back, but really, at least send out full size chips with my dip next time, all right?!

What I can only describe as a 50 min wait for our pizza's while watching everyone seated around us get there food even though they ordered after us. We actually watched a group order after us, get their food, finsh, pay, and leave.  I can only speculate that the waiter screwed up somehow. He stopped checking on us after the pizza's took so long. My group and I were about to leave when the manager came up and apologized for how long it took. She then said the order will be out in 3 minutes (it took 10). We asked our waiter for ranch took him 7 min (in that time we asked another waitress to get us ranch, took her 20 seconds). I don't know what was going on back there but the manager came through. She said the pizza's were on the house and gave us each 10 dollar gift cards. Which we used towards our bill (our bill would have been around 130-140) came out to about 3 bucks. Awesome right? Did I mention that most of the people in my group were very close to finishing their review on yelp when this manager fixed everything.

I do recall also, that the first two slices during previous visits were served by a server.  Apparently this is not longer the case.  So there is not really much service at BJ's any more.  Obviously, this was a pizza made well before we ordered it.  Our salad plates were left at our table well after we had finished eating the salads and were not removed from our table until we were almost finished eating the pizza.  Finally, we felt as if we were being rushed to leave as we had ordered a special and would probably not want anything additional.  I do not understand the service and definitely do not understand why there was such a crowd waiting to be served by  a sub par staff serving sub par food.  Yes, I will not be returning anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=760

At the same time the sun was glaring off car windshields in the parking lot and that actually became worse than the sun, but those windows didn't even have the useless screens so nothing was offered.   I ordered salmon without the champagne butter sauce since I can not have dairy and when it came, it was covered in sauce.  They took it back and in about a half hour brought the salmon with no sauce.  They were kind enough to not charge us for it.  Next time we will NOT allow them to sit us in that space - which is to me a form of banishment for being bad or something.  I do not think that seven people would be too many for the restaurant proper to handle, especially since we were fairly early and there were no people waiting outside.  Other than the awful sun problem and wrong order, the servers were courteous and accommodating so that the evening was not a total disappointment, but pretty close to it.  Something needs to be done about the sun shining in the customer's eyes, even turning the tables 180 degrees would help some, but investing in opaque screens would eliminate half of my complaints about that room;  leaving the room for truly large and boisterous parties would make more sense. More and more people are developing food intolerance's and it would behoove restaurants to pay more attention to requests for changes to orders.  They should offer some gluten free choices along with dairy free sauces, it IS possible to eat well without using allergy provoking ingredients.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=800

I called the waitress over and she said that they can't do pizza without sauce and it was ""only a little"" clearly this woman has no idea what an ALLERGY is. I saw nothing on the menu, nor on the BJ's website saying that you can't get a pizza without tomato sauce. As I clearly ordered my pizza without sauce she should have told me when I ordered so that I could pick something else.

Wait was long, food wasn't that great, and poor service.     When I ordered a broccoli cheddar soup, I found a hair. They got me a new one, but the shredded cheese on top was gone. It looked like they just scraped the hair off and served it to me again.      Someone came to apologize for the soup, I believe it was the manager, but he went to the table next to us. When they corrected him, he left. My boyfriend and I were there for at least 30 minutes, and not once did we see him again. He didn't even bother trying to find the right table to apologize!      I ordered a pizookie, hoping that BJ's would redeem itself. I was about to dig in until my boyfriend noticed there was a green on the back of my spoon, obviously from a previous meal. Really? You didn't even bother to check if my spoon was clean?      I'm not sure if I can even come back after that.

C T.,"Huntington Beach, CA",209,14,1,4.0,12/14/2010,"What's there to say about BJ's that really hasn't already been said?  It has the right mix of restaurant/bar/atmosphere that should have something for everyone. The bartenders pour a solid drink and they have everything you can want -- except Red Bull -- just had to mention that cuz a couple friends of mine like RBV :) Being a fan of craft beer I have to say BJ's beer is pretty good.  My top choice would be the Jeremiah Red.  It's quite smooth and very drinkable.  It goes well with the pizza.  Their pale ale is also very drinkable as are their other selections. I just recently tried their nachos and I have to say, I don't think I've had better nachos anywhere else.  They have your typical nacho toppings with the choice of meat (optional) but what makes these nachos a cut above, is they line the bottom of the dish with chili so when you think you've got nothing left because all the chips on top took all the goodness of the meat, cheese, jalapenos, etc then you get to what has become the best part of the nachos.  No more saving some toppings off other chips to extend to the empty, salty chip... hahahaha.  Plenty of chili to scoop up with those plain chips. Now to the pizza... theirs is quite good.  If you haven't tried the pizza I'd suggest you try the BJ's Favorite, it has many great great toppings that enhances what their pizza is all about.  If you're not into pizza the rest of the menu is diverse with plenty of strong options to really give even the pickiest of people something enticing to try. It gets crowded during peak hours so be prepared to wait to be seated.  Once your seated however, their service has always been real good, never have had any complaints.   It's a cool place to go and hang no matter what the occasion is to celebrate and they have the food and drink selection to make it a good night.  I'm a fan of BJ's and will continue to go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=780

Kira-Marie A.,"Long Beach, CA",105,11,,1.0,1/17/2011,"My boyfriend and I have been to many BJ's Restaurants ranging from so Cali to the Bay Area...and this BJ's by far was the worst one. When we walked in the door the hostess saw that I was there but took a few minutes to acknowledge me. We took a seat in the bar area. One server came and introduced herself  and got my boyfriend's drink while I went to the restroom. When I came back, it was a totally different server. When Kendra (our server) came and got my drink order, I asked for hot tea with extra lemon and honey and then she took our order. Once she was done taking our order she asked me ""you wanted hot tea with extra what?"" I said ""lemon"" and my boyfriend jumped in and said ""honey."" And her reply was ""That's how I always serve, but you want extra lemon and honey (with a little attitude.)""  After we placed our order, she asked if we wanted soup or salad, we both said yes. My boyfriend got his salad but I never got my soup. She never came back to check and see if we needed anything or missing anything, so I never had time to tell her my soup was missing, let alone I couldn't find her to tell her. As our food came out, she came by grabbed the salad plate from my boyfriend and didn't stay a few seconds to ask us if we needed anything else.  When she came to check on us while we were eating our entrees, as she was walking towards us I heard her say ""How's everything?"" Before I was done saying ""everything was OK,"" she already had her back turned and was walking away. At the end of our meal, she dropped off the check, while my boyfriend was eating, she said, ""oh let me take that out of your way (while my boyfriend was still eating the last bite.)""  I just want to say that I used to be a server for a few years, and that was the most HORRIBLE service that I have ever got. She was rude!!!! I usually leave more than an avg tip, but this time, I set my foot down and decided to leave her less than avg. I was very disappointed and was debating on leaving her anything at all. She's lucky I left her something. This was the first and last time I'm ever going to the BJ's in Huntington Beach.

About 10 minutes later both drinks and food came out. Food was just meh...I've had better at the other locations. Drinks were decent though...I love their Blonde beer, tasty!!! I think the drink was the only thing good about this place.... The server never came out to check on us again, until he came out about 20 minutes later with 2 boxes and the check.

Aaron D.,"Anaheim, CA",421,415,27,3.0,2/11/2009,"This location of BJ's really deserves 3.5 stars but Yelp does not allow that type of leeway. This is a very small BJ's. Very tightly packed - hard to move around. Difficult for the servers to get to where they are going.  Patio dining is lovely here though. Due to zoning in Huntington Beach the staff here claims to not have the ability to serve large beers out on the patio. This is a big pain in the ass considering they are a brewery restaurant. If its actually the case - then they need to apply for a variance.  As for BJ's - I often avoid going there because I don't really like any of their appetizers. They are not awful they just also are not great. They need to work on more variety in the menu and on adding some complexity to their recipes. Most bars can make the appetizers they are offering. The Lettuce wraps are pretty good. If you eat meat then the Angus sliders are ok. But, in general: the appetizers are not great. Appetizers don't make a restaurant; but if your a brewery you better work on your appetizers or people will eventually quit dropping in for a beer.  As for the beer - I really enjoy the refreshing quality and flavor of the Brew house Blonde and the two varieties of Pale Ale. The Heif  at BJ's however has a nasty aftertaste. The Jeremiah red is fantastic. And the freshly brewed Root beer is worth trying. Its also delicious with ice cream as a dessert.  On to Entrees. The Salmon is not very good. It could be that its because its farmed and from the Atlantic. Unfortunately many restaurants have not learned that cheap, farmed, crappy, Atlantic Salmon is not every going to taste elegant or amazing. Its going to taste like cheap, farmed, atlantic Salmon. The clam chowder is pretty tasty. They don't always consistently deliver it hot but when they do its wonderful.  The Chardonnay Shrimp Pasta is delicious. They sometimes bring it out with some nasty bacon on top but other times they don't. And some people probably prefer some bacon on their pasta. But, the sauce is fantastic on it. The Jambalaya is pretty tasty here too.  They have a fantastic pazookie. Its a giant cookie with a nice scoop of ice cream served right in the middle of it. Its really a bit much for me but there is nothing wrong with that.  So, overall I would say BJ's in general is ok. But, this location is very small and always crowded.  The Upside is that this place is great for sitting on the patio and people watching. You cant order large beers out on the patio though and they need to do something about it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=780
Lisa N.,"San Clemente, CA",332,144,168,4.0,3/17/2009,"Grade: B+ Why does pizza have to taste so darn good? Terrible for the waistline, yummy for the tummy.  We usually order the BJ's supreme, appetizers (bruschetta, spinach artichoke dip or the avocado rolls though not all at the same time!) or green salad, beer and sometimes the pazookie. BJ's pizza is very tasty but also very heavy. Since they are deep dish, the pizzas are usually very filling.  The appetizers are good starters too. My husband also likes the sliders. Since it is hard to avoid eating carbs at a pizza restaurant, be prepared to be super full. When we aren't in the mood for pizza, we also like their sandwiches. The club sandwich is actually very good. The pazookie is much too sweet, but i usually just have a few bites with ice cream and I'm good. You can call ahead of time to reserve a place in line, plus you can order to go.

Cobb salads usually have major quantities of chicken or turkey, bacon, blue cheese, egg, etc. over lettuce, and that's why I order them - lots of protein and filling. The BJ's version was like 90% chopped iceberg lettuce and I had to hunt for the stuff that wasn't lettuce. My son ordered the steak salad, which looked really delicious and had a lot more heft to it.

D C.,"Las Vegas, NV",202,171,5,3.0,10/26/2010,"BJ's is pretty good, but their Tustin location just seems so much larger/better. They've got a full bar with a large array of beers on tap. Check out the Beer Sampler if you're not sure what to get--7 flutes of beer ranging from very light to very dark await your drinking pleasure--it's good for the ladies because each flute is small and it's diverse. Me? I'd rather just get a few pitchers on tap to wash down the food to come. Happy Hour is decent here, and so is the food. If you like your steak nice and charred like I do, they've got a blackened steak for only $18.95.  Basically everything on the menu is good, with nothing extraordinarily unappealing (except maybe for the Avocado and Santa Fe Spring Rolls--these are gross.) Word of advice: whether you're a health nut, or just someone curious about the nutrional value of the meals here, you should check out the facts about the meal you're about to order. Some of the pizzas have 10,000 mg of sodium! The Pizzookie is also a must. The restaurant chain's signature dessert--it  is utterly delicious.

Ryan F.,"Walnut Creek, CA",107,129,1,4.0,3/1/2009,"There are a lot of BJ's Restaurants in the Orange County area, and they all have their share of problems. The food, at the very least, is always consistently delicious. There are two main problems with this particular BJ's location: 1. The service is inconsistent 2. The restaurant is ALWAYS packed Regarding the service, there are a couple of waiters who are surprisingly horrible yet they continue to be employed. I don't know many companies who will employ horrible workers, but if you're a shitty waiter or waitress you can rest assured you can get a job here. Apart from two specific waiters, the service overall is poor when it comes to timeliness. You'll usually find that if you order an appetizer and your meal at the same time, they'll arrive simultaneously (thus defeating the point of the appetizer). My wife and I have had to work out a system where we order the appetizer with our drinks, then pretend we ""need a few more minutes"" to look over the menu just to ensure we don't get everything delivered all at once. Regarding the crowdedness of the place, the management got smart and now allows people to call-ahead to get their name on the waiting list. If you want to get a table within 15 minutes of you getting there, call ahead at least 10 minutes before you decide to begin driving there. Lastly, there is always a large pack of smokers standing outside the entrance and a smaller pack sitting on the patio near the fountain (where there is no overhang). It's all perfectly legal, but is still annoying. If you hate smoke, wait inside. Oh, and the pizza always makes me sick. Don't order the pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=820

It was drenched in dressing, and there was a lone bit of avocado that definitely wasn't supposed to be there...My friend had a caesar salad, but she said it tasted like it was ranch sauce in place of caesar dressing.

I opted for another blonde. Mmmmhmm. Finished 5 of my samplers...that was good enough for me!  I ordered the chicken quesadilla (mini-meal) and it was good! i ate it with the salsa from the chips and it was even better! they kinda fry their tortilla so its crunchy. I topped it with the lettuce and sour cream provided and it was mmm mmm satisfying.  I tried my friends flatbread and it was good. I like the crunchiness of the crust. I also tried my friends potato skin....SUPER oily! I could only eat one...and still felt guilty. -__- Then I tried my friends mozzarella sticks with marinara sauce! Their sticks are good, but the marinara was somewhat bland and they need to give more sauce for that many sticks (10 sticks!!). I had to dip my sticks in salsa for extra flavoring.  Service....was ok. We were waiting a while for our samplers because the girl forgot what order to bring them in...so they had to re-pour them. :/ Then she spilled some beer on our table...took her a good 10 minutes to come back with some napkins to wipe it off. We ended up wiping the beer spill up...-__-. Our bill took forever to get, pay and sign...we had to flag her down each time we wanted something. Disappointed in the service... but im aware it's not always like this. i'll probably be fair a submit a better review next time.

I used to love the deep dish at the Laguna location, this one was awful. The pizza is so dry and there was so little sauce it tastes like a gigantic breadstick with a few topping thrown on. When the crust is a thick deep dish it should be going and covered with topping, this was not. Service was nothing to write home about either. After trying for 10 minutes to get my servers attention, she was leaning against the wall by the bar avoiding eye contact, she finally came over. I told her the pizza was really dry and asked her for more sauce. About 15 minutes later a different server brought it out. The only reason I have this place ANY stars was the pizookie which was as delish as ever. No wonder it isn't called BJs Pizzaria any longer as their pizza is painfully subpar. Save the carbs by avoiding the pizza and go straight for the pizookie.

I am a big football fan and I really like that they have booths in the bar and a ton of flat screen TVs for watching the game. The late night happy hour is also great because I don't get off work during the week until around 8pm so I always miss regular happy hours but the late night one starts at a perfect time for me. My biggest complaint is that sometimes the bar is completely full during happy hour, while I appreciate that this is a sign of good food and prices, I wish the bar were a little bigger so that I didn't have to go somewhere else.

It's a Pizza Cookie that is topped off with fresh vanilla bean ice cream, that that's after the deep dish cookie is heated up in the oven so that the warm cookie and ice cream just melt in your mouth harmoniously!

I can't stress enough how horrible it is. I went in today and went for the HH special and ordered boneless wings for $5. The plate comes out and there are 5 tiny little wings on this big plate.... What!? I can understand if BJ's had the most amazing wings on earth and people traveled far and wide to get their hands on some boneless wings at BJ's. But no, these were just your less than average heated up wings. I took a second look at the HH menu and it says ""happy hour sizes"" which basically means half the size for half the price. So in other words its not a special. Your not saving money. So why have a happy hour. I don't get it. Other than their horrible HH it is a great restaurant to go out with friends, family or a date.

The only reason why I am giving it 4 stars is because it took an additional 30 mins to get our desserts, which was kind of crazy, and to top it off, personally I think the cookie for the pazookie is way too sweet.

The pizza here is very heavy and fulfilling, their pazookies (dessert) are always awesome.  I ordered their New Orleans style jambalaya this time, and it was delicious - lots of chicken and shrimp and veggies and a whole lot of stuff, yummy. My gf got the chicken breast with mashed potatoes, they seemed to give a smaller portion on the meat, but it was pretty good. Their staff is very friendly, they were a good sport when putting up with my friends and their ridiculousness.  The inside of this place is very clean, loud, has the sports bar feel, and is huge. We ordered our beer separately at the main bar, the bartender was even friendly and chill. Their house beers are just ehhh to decent at best, and for a place called BJ's ""restaurant & brewery"" that's very disappointing. I ordered their nutty brewnette, it's as dark as a new castle, but has a less appealing after taste. The blonde and hef i tried were kinda mediocre as well.

kenneth c.,"Kahului, HI",3,16,8,2.0,8/7/2014,I like to eat at this location and when we have group parties this place hits the spot. My review though is based on their take out department. Phoned in an order around 9pm for a bbq chicken pizza. I arrive 35 min walk in to pick up my take out.  The guy at the register tells me he can't find my order. I told him are you serious you told me to come in 30 min and you don't have my order ready. He goes in the kitchen to double check  comes out empty handed and said sorry but at the time of the order you placed the registers got rebooted and the order probably got lost. Tired of arguing I said if you knew it rebooted you should have made sure it went in or jus hand write it it's common sense. He basically jus said ya they can make it right now if you can wait 30 min. Pretty much defeats the purpose of doing a take out. No apologies and didn't do anything to make the situation right.

H Q.,"Placentia, CA",153,715,1751,3.0,8/14/2009,"3 1/2 seems right on for this place.  I came on a Friday night and it was really busy. We waited about a half hour before getting seated. No big deal. There were four of us and we got sat in a booth. I felt the booth was too small. Especially the table. When the two large pizzas came out and were placed on our table, one of the pans was sticking in my face the whole time. I couldn't move it because there was nowhere else to move it to.  We had the BJ Specialty (?) and the Sweet Pig. I actually liked the crust on them. They were light and doughy. The toppings were good. I prefer pizza with tomato sauce than chunks of tomato. I don't know if that's because I'm used to 'low grade' pizza than 'gourmet' pizza, but that's how I like it. Evenso, I ate two pieces of each style and was full.  We also ordered one of those Pizookie things. It was pretty rich and like a previous reviewer said, you can easily make this at home. The only draw back to that would be you would eat too much of it. According to the nutrition facts that are in BJ's Menu, the Pizookie that we ordered consisted of 4,219 calories! Yikes! Oh well, gotta indulge occasionally. I got my chocolate fix, so I was happy.  Service was passable. Our waiter didn't seem too happy. There was a cute Hispanic waitress that I wish had our section, but that's the way it goes. Anyways, the waiter did everything we asked of him even though he wasn't very enthusiastic.  Truthfully, I think I would only come to BJ's if someone wanted to go there. It wouldn't be my decision. I don't have anything against them, but saying ""How about BJ's"" to a bunch of guy friends is just too weird.

I had the Ahi Poke to start.  The poke was all right.  The wonton chips that came with the dish were possibly the highlight of the dish...  and for a poke, that's sort of sad.  The tuna seemed reasonably fresh, but didn't pack a punch in flavors (as a poke should). I appreciated the ""Small Bites"" part of the menu that offered tapa-like portions (and prices - around $3-4 a plate) of food.  I had the street tacos.  The server let me order one of each type (chicken and beef).  Both were well seasoned and delicious.  The salsa was good and not too salty.  There was a small side of cabbage and jalepenos also. I got to sample a piece of their new portabello mushroom deep dish pizza.  It was ok.  I dislike places that advertise for truffles or portabello (or any other specific type of fungi) and not deliver.  Don't get me wrong, there was about one piece of a medium sized portabello per each slice of pizza and a few white buttom mushroom throughout, but it wasn't anything special. They are serving their seasonal special right now: their pumpkin beer.  It's definitely a delicious beer to pair with your pizza! Service was great.  The server was very attentive.  One of the managers came out to apologize that the pizza had taken so long to come out (I thought it took a while, but didn't think it was anything to get upset about).

Karen C.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,10,,2.0,9/30/2012,"Two disasters in a row at BJ's on Beach Blvd.  I think the reason so many of us do not have a good dining experience is the (inefficient and impersonal) SYSTEM  they have going.  When the server puts a drinks order (into a computer) you then have to wait about 15-20 minutes or longer.  Last week our server never got around to putting our order in, which we found out a half hour later from a different server.  It is a huge restaurant and we see servers RUNNING to keep up, and they sometimes  can't.  Last night our server would not even TAKE an order for a second beer until the glass was empty(!).  That meant (on the two occasions) we were not refreshed with a second drink until we'd been long out of what we had and the meal was essentially finished.  Apparently this is a hard and fast rule that allows no room for discretion on the part of the server.  We are in our early 70s and had not been to BJ's in about a year.  In the meantime we've been spoiled by other restaurants that demonstrate they are happy to have our business by providing good food and attentive, prompt, and friendly service.  We won't go back because it just isn't worth the aggravation.  Too bad because we like many items on the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=640

ciara c.,"Temecula, CA",288,211,104,4.0,3/12/2011,"For what this place is - a chain restaurant where you pretty much know the kind and quality of food you're going to get before you set foot in the door - it's pretty decent.  Went with the mother in law and my husband around 6pm on a weekend. We had about a 15 minute before we were seated. That was nothin' compared to what people went through an hour later.  Sat down, took a look at their drink/wine list, and wow! They serve some decent wines on their list. Waiter brought us those right away.  NOTE to anyone on a diet or watching their weight: BJ's might not be the right place for you. Restaurants in OC have started to list calorie and fat amounts contained in the dishes on the menu. Most of BJ's entrees will set you back nearly an entire day's worth (or more) of calories and fat. I was pretty astounded to see those numbers.  So, more because of the fact that I don't eat chicken or red meat, I ordered the garden burger. My husband ordered the Chicken pasta with masala sauce. He loved that. Mother in law got shrimp scamp with pasta. She liked that also, though saved 1/2 for her lunch the next day.  The garden burger tasted better than most served in restaurants. You could tell it was made with rice, veggies, maybe some wheat gluten. Came with lots of onions, lettuce, tomato and a gigantor wheat bun. If you love your carbohydrates, just come in and ask for the bun. They also butter and toast/fry the bun.  It's a fun place, lots of people watching, TVs if you want to watch sports, pretty good food and an upbeat vibe. They provide good and friendly service, too.  One more thing to note: when we were leaving, about 7pm, the lobby/waiting area teemed with people, all milling around, looking down at the little black, square pagers in their hands, every time someone else's buzzed. Get there early - or very late - or be prepared to wait a long time for a table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=640

Jenni I.,"Huntington Beach, CA",246,277,40,3.0,7/21/2013,"I came here for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon before  I had to go to work (always a bad idea). I called ahead of time to ask them what the wait was and they said there was no wait... yet we had to wait for about 10 minutes for our table to be ready... I think a party after us got seated first (I could be wrong, so don't quote me on that). But it's fine, we still got seated pretty promptly. It took forever for the waiter to take our order though. I swear we were sitting there for almost half an hour when he finally came... it was NOT busy, mind you. The server looked a bit melancholic so maybe he was having a bad day. Who knows. In any case after we finally ordered, I noticed my plate had some food on it, so I was wiping it (as I do at Asian restaurants haha never an American restaurant like BJs). Our melancholic server asked if I would like a new plate and so I said yes and he took the dirty plate... and then he never came back with a new one! I had to wait until the pizza came (the person who brought the pizza out noticed I was missing a plate so he brought one). Ughhh, delaying my food experience. Not cooooool. Anyway, I'll give BJs some credit for food. I love BJs pizzas. They always come out delicious and I enjoy it.

Grace S.,"La Mirada, CA",168,55,322,5.0,9/26/2009,"My two favorite entrees at BJ's are the Balsamic Glazed Chicken and New Orleans Jambalaya. I normally don't like chain restraints because there is never enough flavor in the food, but each dish is surprisingly oozing with flavor. The crispy friend onion strings on the Balsamic Glazed Chicken gives the dish a perfect balance of texture and flavor against the chicken and cheddar mashed potatoes while the Jambalaya doesn't skimp one bit on the spicy sauce or meat. I always wish the Jambalaya came with more rice because there is so much chicken, shrimp, and sausage on the plate. I usually manage to take part of the Jambalaya home and just add more rice later on and since there was so much flavor in the meat it still tastes great the next day. There is no way I can leave a BJ's without having a Pizookie, usually chocolate chunk for me, but they have white chocolate macadamia nut, peanut butter or oatmeal raisin walnut. It comes with two scoops of vanilla ice cream on top of the hot of the oven cookie. It's worth every extra calorie. I'll just have a smaller meal the next time. I've never done it, but this seems like a great place to just come have a beer with a group of friends.

Don H.,"Costa Mesa, CA",136,133,54,1.0,7/30/2012,"I was contacted by an area manager after my first trip here and after some mishaps in the communication I was sent an apology letter and a ""courtesy card"". I am a very reasonable man and understand everyone has off days and I am more than willing to give a second chance. However the second chance was almost worse than the original. Our waiter apparently forgot about us at one point because we didn't see him for about a half an hour. When he saw us and was startled back into to remembering he was in charge of us, he stuttered out asking why we hadn't got our dessert yet. We had in fact finished our dessert a good 20 minutes earlier. For god knows what reason we went again, mostly because we still had credit there. We didn't expect much, and thats about what we got. Asked for 2 glasses of water, didn't get it, constantly waited for refills, asked about the spice of the hot wings was told the  regular buffalo was spicy and the other spicy ones were unbearable. Regular were not spicy at all and when I asked for the hotter sauce, I got a cold side of sauce which was fitting since my wings had gone cold waiting for him to come back, our pizookie which had been the saving grace came out with the ice cream mostly melted.

Holly E.,"Huntington Beach, CA",92,33,50,4.0,2/20/2011,"I don't know if it was because it was raining or because it was a Saturday night, or both, but this place was cuh-razy crowded. The hostess was training (which added to some of the seating confusion I think) some people got pagers, some did not. Luckily we stood right by the podium and heard when they were looking for us.  Our waiter was also training (being shadowed by his trainer the whole night) We each ordered a drink and an appetizer along with our entrees. We gave him the whole order at once and were quite flummoxed when our entrees came out first (flummoxed but not upset, i mean, it all ends up in the same spot anyway right?) Our waiter's trainer came by shortly thereafter with our appetizers and apologized profusely swearing that they entered it correctly and it never happens and that he would let his manager know. I thought this was very thoughtful of him, considering we weren't complaining about it. (though we were at a little 2 person table and trying fit four big plates on it was entertaining.) About 2 minutes later, the manager came by and apologized again, saying they were going to comp our appetizers (which they didn't need to do, but we were grateful) Everyone was very nice about the whole situation (which they made a much bigger deal of than we had.) They also got my french fry order wrong, but I didn't care; potato/potato.  Throughout the night we encountered a total of five different people being trained (which on a Saturday night on a holiday weekend may not have been the best scheduling choice) i think this added to the general chaos of the restaurant that night, there were just too many people working. There was nothing particularly impressive about the food (i mean, it was good, just not mind blowing) I'm giving them this rating because of the amazing customer service we received. They handled a potentially upsetting situation very well, and I commend them for that. They had no way of knowing that we weren't the kind of people to totally flip out over something so trivial (YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE!) And they took care of us anyway.

To begin with, the manage at the front desk tried to dissuade us from using a $10 off that we had as part of the rewards program. She told us we had a PIZOOKIE' coming--covering up the place on the card that said $10 off!! The menus were ripped halfway up the middle to start with. Service was incredibly slow, the waitress was not friendly at all and didn't even tell us her name. We ordered our food, medium pizza, garlic bread which is what we usually order. The garlic bread comes out within 10 mins as a rule.......not this time. It didn't come and it didn't come. I knew something was up. Pizza came out about 25 mins later with a plate of what looked like little hard planks of bread with some mozzarella melted on top. We said to her ""this isn't the garlic bread we always get"" and proceeded to describe what we wanted. She went back to the back and came out 5 mins later saying ""This is the only bread we have, we don't carry any other kind"". Keep in mind, my son had had the regular garlic bread less than a month before. Got done with the pizza, sat a good 10 mins more before she noticed us and brought us a box for leftovers. Sat a good 10 mins more before she brought the bill. This was at 3:30 on a Thursday afternoon, it was dead. They weren't busy at all.

For your birthday, they will give a tiny one for free (the size is actually really cute). From 3-7, and 10-closing, they have a happy hour special if you sit in the bar area (at the bar and the tables close by counts, too). Parking can get super hectic 'cause they share it with Party City. They do offer curbside service, where you call to do a pick-up order, then call them to let them know you're on the way and they will come out and hand it to you while you're in the car (they have a couple of spots designated in the front of the restaurant for this kind of service). On busy days and if you don't want to wait, you can tell them that you want to sit in the patio and you will most likely get a seat right away!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=900

I used to be a student at GWC and took some lovely classes like anatomy and microbiology at night cause that was the only time I could find a class with any openings by the time I could sign up for em, so this place actually became a good spot to hit after class ended around 10. One could get a mini pizza (or 2) for 1/2 price (only in the bar) and their coffee is actually quite good, on the strong side, but no complaints bout that from me..so I would come here and refuel and re-write my lecture notes or get organized from whatever was covered in class earlier that evening.  So if any students are taking night classes at GWC, this might be a decent option. Pizza is pretty consistently good and they are definitely one of the better nationwide chains and of course thier famous pizookie.

He seemed like he thought he was so cute that no one would care if he was attentive with service or not. He did not have that kind of looks to be getting by on in my opinion he should step it way up if he wants to earn any money. He asked us if we wanted to order our entree when we ordered our appetizer. Um ok does that mean they come out around the same time ? he said no but of course he did. Then we asked for desert menus and he just came back and asked what we wanted and I'm thinking um hello are you stoned we asked for the menu. Idk if they are supposed to have bussers but he bussed our table in a poor fashion. Whatever. And we ordered the most chocolate rich thing for desert and had to flag him down to re ask for water. The food was ok, pizza is the thing to get here. They have tons of other stuff but don't bother with anything containing shrimp here as its frozen not fresh. bleh. And the chicken in lettuce wraps was watery. Do get the Mozzarella sticks, spinach dip, wedge fries. The pizzas are a do but don't bother with the chicken dishes, I think most of their meat is frozen.

He had he kitchen remake it and all but when he repeated her order he had the modification down...so I'm not sure why it was made wrong.  I'll give it that it was probably the kitchen's fault.  It took him another 10minutes for the kitchen to remake it.  After our food was served (minus my sister) we had to bother other srvers and the food runner to grab us condiments and to refill our water.  We all shared w/her while she waited.  She was full and we had it boxed up by the time she came back.  The manager never stopped by and the dish was never taken off the check.  This visit was not pleasant at all compared to our last visit.  I still gave it 2 star becuase the food was still good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=900

The atmosphere is that of a sports bar if you are sitting in the main area next to the bar, they have a large screen that shows 4 sports channels at the same time.  Appetizers are great, with my favorite being the avocado eggrolls and the spinach with artichoke dip.

Cayleen O.,"Costa Mesa, CA",202,84,3,2.0,7/22/2007,"Great food, great service.  Shxt for brains when it comes to reservations. When it comes to popular chain restaurants I'd highly recommend making reservations especially for a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday night.  But I'm sorry to say that this probably won't help you if you have a large party reservation. I made reservations for 8 oclock for a party of 10 the day before.  We were celebrating my boyfriends 21st so imagine how relieved I was to have it at such a casual spot. They called the next morning to confirm my reservation and I asked to change the party size to 15 since more of his friends confirmed. We're at the front desk at 7:45 to make our presence known and they tell me that the reservation says 6 butt fxck oclock earlier that evening.  WHAT??????????????????????? 10+ friends and acquaintances stand with me and I am baffled with the mix up. I'm sorry, excuse me...  WHAT?!??!?! AGAIN I SAY WHAT??????? They tell me that they'll seat the party as soon as possible but they just seated a party of 30 and a party of 40 in the semi-private rooms meant to accomodate 15+ customers. So, one of the party members theory was that they bumped my reservation intentionally to make room for the larger party. That is bull shxt. So after an hour of waiting (and three party members leave) we are seated.  I ask to speak to the manager after dealing with the man at the front desk unfortunate enough to have to deal with me.  He handled me very professionally and apologized for the screw up. I did not in fact take my anger out on him because twas not his fault. Though I did ask the manager for some free appetizers for the inconvenience and the long wait. Bomb diggity he hooked it up and apologized. From then on the evening was redeemed by our awesome waitress who dealt with 15 ferociously hungry young adults. The combo appetizer platter was bomb.  DEFINITELY try the avocado egg roll things as a starter.  You won't regret it.  & you can almost NEVER go wrong ordering their pizza.  My favorite?  The BBQ chicken melts my heart every dxmn time. Free appetizers, great beer/drinks, and great food still didn't make up for the mix up. 2 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=880
Heather A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",35,79,13,1.0,6/16/2011,"I am extremely frustrated and disappointed with the food I received from BJ's delivery. I've ordered many times and my order has never been this bad. I've ordered the California chicken sandwich many times before, but this time it was missing the chilies and had nasty barely cooked bacon and wilty lettuce on it which should NOT be on that sandwich in the first place. The chili and cheese baked potato had barely any topping on it whatsoever, nothing like the picture. You would probably be completely embarrassed to bring that to a customer actually sitting at the restaurant. The buffalo wings were completely plain with no sauce on them!!!! The menu says they are drizzled in sauce, with sauce on the side for dipping. Who wants plain chicken? I could have gotten that at KFC. To top it all off the extra ranch that was ordered was forgotten as well, even though she read my order back to me. I cannot believe I paid 40 dollars for this! It leaves you with such a bad feeling spending so much and not getting what you order and there's no one that can fix it for you. I haven't been this disappointed by a restaurant in so long. I'm sure my little problem doesn't mean anything to such a huge company. But hopefully something can change, because they've definitely lost a few frequent customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=880
A Y.,"Glendale, AZ",16,238,14,4.0,12/17/2009,"Best chain out there. BJ's delivers quality deep dish pizza and hearty salads. Nothing on the menu has let me down yet. The honorable mention goes to the fried avocado eggrolls. Crunchy on the outside and smooth melt-in-your-mouth on the inside. Add a generous dollop of dressing and you're in heaven! The honey chicken salad is also highly recommended. To finish your meal, order a pazookie, it'll give you sweet dreams at night. Come between meal times to avoid the crowd.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=880

Matt S.,"Whittier, CA",0,25,3,1.0,6/8/2012,"Food was acceptable but at those prices I expect much better service. Our servers forgot everything, drinks, utensils and soups. When we reminded them for our soups they said ""they'll make sure to add that to our bill"" wtf? We already ordered the soups. They acted very rude and oblivious to their jobs.

Kevin L.,"Westminster, CA",751,68,9,4.0,1/2/2010,"I've been here on numerous occasions and i have yet to have a bad complaint about this place. I usually don't have to wait long for a table, and service is generally good. Food is decent for what you pay for and the drinks are good. I think the one thing anyone really ever comes here for is their world-famous pazookies. My friend and I shared the Triple Chocolate Pazookie. OMG! So decadent and rich! It had rich, ghiradelli chocolate ice cream, over a warm, oven baked chocoate cookie with bits of ghiradelli chocolate baked in with chunks of ghiradelli chocolate sprinkled on top.

Shane D.,"Torrance, CA",32,10,21,4.0,7/9/2012,"Went this last Saturday for Linner (in between lunch and dinner). The service was quick and the food was really good. I enjoyed the Chicken a la Fresca, and my wife had the Mediterranean Pizza. While it is always loud sitting near the bar I am still glad they recently added more booths with much more seating in that section. I used to avoid Bj's because they always had a huge wait and I totally think the extra seating is helping. Overall the only thing you still can't get my kids to eat are the Happy Face fries... The rest of the food was really tasty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=880

May N.,"Westminster, CA",0,2,,3.0,8/24/2012,"okay, let's see. i went with two friends and it took us about 15 minutes to get seated. i'm not complaining. our server didn't seem to want to be there, i don't know, maybe she was having a bad day. well i asked her what kind of deep dish pizza was popular and she recommended the buffalo chicken, so i ordered that. it was OVER SEASONED. omg, i hate water but i downed the water cause it was so salty. and my friend had a clam chowder bread bowl and to her dismay, there was barely any clamchowder. i mean the bread bowl looks pretty big, there should be a decent amount of clam chowder in it... but nopee. no complaints about the burger tho. to end our night, we got a pizookie trio. we ordered 3 different ones but when we got it, we had 3 of the same one even after the server double checked on our order. however, she corrected the mistake and we got 3 more pizookie. most likely why i gave then the extra star because the main entree is definately 2 star. thank god i love dessert that much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=880
Jim S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",545,64,15,3.0,2/11/2012,"I'm a fan because of the food but on the other hand I've been displeased with the service here multiple times. Like someone else said below . . . your service depends on the server you get and not the consistency of Bj's. I've had great servers and some who are definitely not so great : /  Also, my fiance and I made reservations here for my birthday once and they forgot/didn't write down our reservation. We ended up waiting a long time and it was a downer on the birthday fun. I tried making another reservation for my fiance's birthay and they gave me a hard time about making a reservation for 10 people because they had another reservation for 100 people. The food is good but not as good as TGI Fridays in my personal opinion and the service always varries but if you want to go to a place with a fun atmosphere that's in a good location, then this is the place. Last note, the downtown HB Bj's gets the same review except with much worse service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=880
Phil L.,"Huntington Beach, CA",446,81,6,4.0,9/9/2009,best restaurant pizza money can buy. my favorite is the meat lover or the buffalo wing pizza. they also have the BEST strawberry lemonade around. and for desert (must have) order the pazooki...its a personal sized cookie with your choice of ice cream on top.

Stephanie R.,"Huntington Beach, CA",130,234,44,1.0,7/21/2009,"Hmmmmmmmm.....? mixed feelings here.  I have been here many, MANY times! And this is my first really, REALLY bad experience.  So tonight I have decided this will be my last time I subject myself to mediocre, overpriced food served by pushy, unpleasant servers.  My experience started off with a short 15 minute wait for our table (no biggie.) From there, we waited another 15 minutes for a server to greet us (NOT COOL.) The server who greeted us, told us she wasn't our waitress but would take our drink order (and after 15 minutes of waiting around) our dinner order. After taking our order we waited yet another 10 minutes to get our drinks, while in the meantime, my salad makes it out before my drink does. So I awkwardly scarf down my salad (which I found 1 moldy crouton in it) as my dinner-mates sat with no drinks staring at me. When our drinks finally came out, our food came out literally moments later. (whatever, again, no biggie) Okay... this is the part that pissed me off. My dinner-mates and I were not even half way done with our meals and she asked us if we wanted dessert (as if she wanted to get us out of there), we politely responded that we didn't know yet because we weren't close to finishing our meals yet. She responded by saying that she will just leave the check and if we wanted anything else to ""holler"" for her. Not even 5 minutes later, she asked AGAIN, if we wanted any dessert. We ended up responding yes, just because it was my cousin's birthday, for which we got a free pazookie (only highlight of the night.) No joke, from the moment the pazookie hit the table, we were harassed 3 times for the bill, even though she could plainly see we still had food on our table and 3/4 full beers on the table. Now, I usually am very lenient with service, because I had been a server for over 4 years. But there really was no excuse for her pushy service, because she was still taking tables, it wasn't like we were her last table or being over demanding or anything.  Bottom line; food is always consistently average and overpriced, service HAD been great, up until now.  Count me out!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=880
David G.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,4,,1.0,2/16/2014,"Decent food awful service.  We ordered salads and entrees, 20 minutes later with no contact from our server the entrees showed up.  We told the girl who brought them (not our server) to make sure the salads were removed from our bill, she said she'd bring them, we said forget it, just take them off.  About 5 minutes later our server shows up with our salads.  The manager came over and offered to comp us a desert because of the error, I thanked him and said great.  After our meal was done we ordered a pizookie which took a good 15 minutes to show up, again not brought by our server.  At this point we were going to guess how much the check was and throw down the cash and leave, but our sever showed up with the check just as I was pulling out my wallet.....we were charged for the desert but the server was already gone, and I had already spent an hour too long getting crapped on.  Paid for it and won't be going back, not even on a bet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach?start=880
