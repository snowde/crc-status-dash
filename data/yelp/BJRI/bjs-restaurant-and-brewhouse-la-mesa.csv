Enrique G.,"La Jolla, CA",8,102,70,5.0,12/23/2017,It's just GOOOOOD comfort food with a very large menu that has something for everyone to try. It's all tasty and fresh. Highly recommended for a quick bite or an after hours  visit,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa
Jerry P.,"Escondido, CA",74,94,87,5.0,11/12/2017,"I'm a huge fan of BJ's restaurant.   I enjoy the beers they brew, almost everything I have tried on the menu has been fantastic, and I have never had bad service.   The place is popular, so when you go, prepare to wait.   The Stout and Red beers they have are amazing.  I just tried their IPA and wasn't that much of a fan of it.  I like Double IPA's b/c they have more of a bite to them, so that may be why I didn't enjoy it as much.   I tried several of their pizza's, but think the spicy chicken is my favorite.  I had their spaghetti and meatballs more than once and love it.  The portion sizes are large, so I always have the remainder the next day.   They have Pizookie dessert,  which comes in several different flavors, and you can mix two of them...  they are to amazing.  If you download their app, checkin with it, they will give you one for free. I've been to the North County location, Mission Valley, and now Grossmont Center here in California as well as a location in Maryland.   I have never had bad service, in fact, every employee I dealt with had great attitudes, excellent sense of humors, and were very prompt and attentive.    I definitely recomend this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa
Marissa D.,"La Mesa, CA",239,53,123,3.0,10/26/2017,My mom wanted to get lunch one afternoon and we decided to pick BJs because of the huge menu they have! There's something for everyone and more!  We were seated immediately but the server took a while to greet us.  I ordered the half rack of ribs with a side salad and mashed potatoes which was right around $20. I'm a HUGE fan of anything bbq so I was so excited to try them!  Once the salad arrived I took a few bites and it was just drenched with dressing so I had to be that annoying customer that asks for a new one with dressing on the side and you could tell that the server was irritated. I received my new salad and after that she wouldn't make eye contact with me.  But I got my ribs and they were to die for! And it was a Tuesday so the pazookie was only $3!!!  I'll of course be back at some point and I hope I have a better experience then. I'll go back for the food but not the service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa
Ed P.,"San Diego, CA",60,176,109,5.0,1/12/2018,Came in today with friends for a quick bite and used my BJs app and made reservations for the 3 of us.  The service was outstanding and were visited by store manager Braxton; he asked about our meal quality and really takes and interest in our satisfaction! He is a great manger and see he takes interest with patrons and staff.  Our table was always cleared of done dishes and drinks were always topped.  With all the choices in the mall we love BJs the most. The new menus is awesome and the spaghetti with meatballs is well prepared.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa
Yuleni D.,"San Diego, CA",25,92,92,4.0,11/23/2017,"Food was very good! Server was super on top of it,especially considering one of the servers was just taken away by ambulance. We had ordered a deep dish buffalo pizza and it was super good. (Could have used a little more buffalo sauce though) I really liked the dough and tge flavors mingled well together. We also had a flat thin market pizza, Italian something. It was also very good. Only thing that sucked here was that we had to ask fir for the channel to be changed 3x before it happened. It was the manager who was in charge of it but it felt like we didnt matter to him. By the time he changed it we were almost done with our pizza. Oh well kinda sucky.Anyway the server was good and so was the food. I'll definitely come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa
Lana G.,"El Cajon, CA",0,5,,3.0,1/13/2018,My food was AMAZING along with my waitress . She was on it ... topped off my water every chance she got very personable all around great customer service . Unfortunately I took a few stars off due to the hostess working that day ... sent me back to my table after I got my bill stating that they couldn't help me and that my waitress was responsible for handling that even tho they had a cash register in front of them. Walked back to my table luckily my waitress was around and she looked a little bothered and said to me that they were perfectly capable of assisting me and that she apologized I had to come back . Rude rude rude rude ruuuuuude ... I had a great time till finding that out .

Audrey M.,"San Diego, CA",172,148,148,4.0,8/7/2017,"We go here about 4-5 times a year and must say it never disappoints. The wait can be long, but most of the time it is 15-20minutes. If you don't want to wait, just have your meal in the bar area.  My favorite thing to order is their chicken Parmesan. It is always moist and has a super crispy breading. The serving size is also huge, you get two big pieces of chicken parmesan, huge scoop of mashed potatoes and a huge scoop of veggies.  We always end our meal with a pizookie. If you are sharing with people, get pizookie sampler!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa
Mansour S.,"Rancho San Diego, San Diego, CA",121,222,1022,4.0,4/21/2017,"Havent been here for almost a year , i always get burgers here with some of their best beers And it havent failed me , today since i was on a diet ( trying to lose some pounds) so i had to search for lowest calories , so i choose peruvian qinuoa bowl with shrimp (550 calories) & my friend ordered lemon thyme chicken with extra lemon thyme sauce , my meal was ok it was full of shrimp but shrimp was salty and i felt it needed to have more qinuoa and maybe little less shrimp   i liked the flavor, next time i wouldnt go with it , lemon thyme chicken was good yet no extra sauce i might choose this one next time if i am ordering low calorie meal , overall food is ok i deducted a star because its not that perfect. Our waitress was nice and took care of us , she kept our glasses full without us asking .

Charles C.,"La Mesa, CA",54,200,772,3.0,11/2/2017,"Corporate owned and managed restaurants are pervasive in San Diego and elsewhere, and they can have a value when you seek the experience they offer. That value is usually one of consistency, of meeting expectations. You know what you will get and what you will NOT get.  All I wanted was to sit quietly at a large booth in an uncrowded room, sip white wine and nibble on something familiar. No challenges or unnecessary interactions.  I was intending to attend the 5:30 p.m. All Saints Day Mass at Our Lady of Grace Roman Catholic Church in El Cajon on Tuesday, so I wanted to eat at 3:30 p.m. in the area.  I knew BJ's Restaurant [where I have been before] was just down Fletcher Parkway from the Church at Grossmont Center, so I decided to eat there. It was very quiet when I entered BJ's at 3:30 p.m. The cheerful hostess greeted me immediately, and led me to a large, semi-circular booth, as I had requested [there are only five such booths in the restaurant---ask for them]. I inquired of the hostess if the Happy Hour applied only to the bar, or if it also encompassed the dining room. She stated it was in the bar only, adding ""but I am sure your waiter will be able to accommodate you since we are not busy"". When the tall waiter arrived at the table, I inquired about Happy Hour wines and he stated ""He did not have the menu and he would need ""manager approval"". I replied ""Don't bother"", since the hassle and effort was not worth it. Regardless, the regular price of the House Chardonnay at BJ's is only $6.50, which beats a Gaslamp ""Happy Hour"" $10.00 wine price any day.  While I was looking over the menu, another waiter was in a loud personal conversation with another server which was distracting. Happily, after about five minutes of my hearing all about his life, that waiter went back to work.  The WIFI works perfectly.  I noted the restaurant seems fond of squeezing twosomes into tiny booths squashed against a divider, even though there were many more commodious tables available. The menu is presented in a plasticized spiral ""notebook"". On the cover of the menu is a photograph of a large dessert [""Salted Caramel 'Pizookie'""]. I do not like to see a photograph of a dessert on the cover of a menu from which I am ordering my meal. It makes it looks like a dessert menu.  I ordered the Chicken Club Sandwich on grilled sourdough, served with French Fries, which was delivered with lightening speed.  The after-dinner Irish Coffee was properly made.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa
Kobe B.,"La Mesa, CA",1,13,3,5.0,1/12/2018,Louie /Luis was our server for tonight and he gave us an amazing service. Super friendly and fast.

Adrienne J.,"San Diego, CA",157,78,6,5.0,12/27/2017,"We've been coming here FAR too often for FAR too long, and that's ok with me!  Every time we are disappointed (which isn't a lot), the service team and/or management ensures that we are taken care of appropriately.  Case in point, last evening....the kitchen was a bit on the slow side and our kids received their pizza far after we had our food.  The manager acknowledged that the time of making our food was ridiculous, mentioned that we were long standing patrons, and immediately removed ALL the food from the bill.  THAT is top notch, folks!  Their servers have become like family to us, and we have NEVER been made to feel unwelcome there.  Kudos, BJ's...you keep doing you!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa
Jessi G.,"Lakeside, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/13/2018,No stars from me! ABSOLUTE HORRIBLE customer service.. order curb side Taylor is who took my order.. I called in fridah night at 9:16 pm was instantly put on hold okay no biggie. . She came back to the phone with an attitude.. I order the great white pizza (it was my favorite) I ask for tomatoes and mushrooms on half the pizza only.. she repeated my order back to me correctly.. . I proceeded to go get my order... rude as hell at the register not sure the gals name.. they brought my pizza out completely wrong mushrooms on all the pizza no tomatoes at all. So I let them know that they messed it up .. they took it back with a bunch more attitude.. 15 mins later brought me another pizza (great white) completely cold no mushrooms an tomatoes on the entire pizza and still had the nerve to cop an attitude.. at this point I'm completely frustrated. I'm allergic to these veggies. My pizza is cold. So I let them know it was WRONG AGAIN. Another 20 minutes later I finally got the pizza I ordered. && It was completely dried out also. The customer service running thru this business is SHIT.  The job of a waiter an waitress is to  listen an write the order down. . Completely disappointed an WILL NOT RETURN. Mind you they mess up the same pizza every time I go in. This time I did curb side to save time.. it was a 35 minute ordeal when it should of taken 5 minutes. Booooo.

Jennica S.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",639,405,1367,2.0,12/30/2016,"This review is a bit late, but better late than never. BJ's was one of the restaurants participating in the Veteran's Day specials, so I went to this location with my sister and brother-in-law because the wait for the Chula Vista location was too long.  The Vet's special at BJ's was a free entree (for up to $12.95) and a free beer. My bro-in-law got a deep dish pizza and was going to pay the difference, my sister got a flatbread, and I got a burger. The food took a really, really long time to get to us. We waited patiently, and we understood how busy it was, but our waiter didn't really check up on us. Other people got their food before us, as well. Not to mention, our waiter took a long time to get us our waters, and forget to give us our lemons despite us asking several times. He even had the chance when he gave us our appetizer, but forgot. The food was delicious, and we were all very satisfied. The main problem was the customer service. Davis was our server, and not only did he not check on us a lot, he messed up on the bill multiple times. He failed to do the Vet's special (for the entree and the beer), so we had to remind him. Also, he didn't make one of the beers free. Then it was the wrong entree that he took the money off of.  There were multiple mistakes, but after having him fix it (and take long to pick up the check), we just let it be. Another note! When we called the Chula BJ's location, the person who answered the phone was sweet and you could hear the smile in her voice. Whereas when calling the Grossmont BJ's location, the girl who answered sounded rude and impatient. Although it's busy, customer service is still a thing. I don't think I'd come back to this location, but at least the food was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa

Sheryl K.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,,1.0,10/6/2017,"We had been here once before, enjoyed ourselves and the food so decided to come back again. I am not a complainer but they need to know when something is wrong so they can fix it. As an appetizer we decided to split the Seared Ahi Salad. It came to the table split which was nice and I asked the food runner for some soy sauce to go with. He told me they did not have soy sauce, I said really, can you check please? We took bites of the salad while waiting for soy sauce for the Ahi, the salad was very good HOWEVER the Seared Ahi was still frozen!!! Really???? It tasted hard, ice still on it and extremely fishy. The Runner ended up finding some soy sauce in the back, but when he came back to the table we asked to have the manager come over to speak with us. We told her about the frozen Ahi on salad, how it was horrible and she apologized, did not charge us for salad and said they would pay special attention with the rest of our meal and that dessert would be on the house. It took quite a while for our main course to come, our server never checking on us, finally when it did come my husbands Salmon was quite good he said but the sides, rice and broccoli were ice cold. My Prime Rib Dip was ice cold, French fries were good though. Our server never came to check on us and by that time we were so hungry we ate it anyway. We ordered our dessert ""to go"" because we just wanted to go home after all the trouble we had, the Triple Chocolate Cookie thing and Salted Caramel one too, ice cream on the side. Too funny when I got home to see that dessert was not what I ordered at all, it was the Monkey Bread cookie thing (hard as a rock, inedible) and the Macadamia cookie. They did include the choc chips and chocolate sauce for the undelivered Triple Chocolate cookie thing though! Dessert went in the trash. I do need to mention that the bathroom was very messy with no toilet paper in it either!  All and all, after a hard work week, just wanting to go out, relax and feel you got your money's worth on a nice dinner was all I wanted. BJ's was a huge disappointment and we will not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa
Nette B.,"San Diego, CA",1627,1011,2000,3.0,10/2/2016,"Came here on a Sunday morning for breakfast and to watch a little bit of football. We sat in the bar area.  Food:  I ordered the short stack pancakes and a side of bacon cooked soft or undercooked and Tupac had the 2 eggs with bacon and toast.  He thought his breakfast was alright.  For me, the pancakes were delicious.  Unfortunately, the bacon was not done or  cooked the way I wanted so I didn't eat it but Tupac ended up eating it.   With that said, I asked our server how the kitchen prepares the bacon.  I kinda knew already but had to ask.  I asked if they prepare the bacon all at once and leave it in a container as people order.  She responded with ""Yes, that's how they prepare it.""  So I then said, this is the reason why I ordered it soft and undercooked because my bacon was extremely hard like jerky and covered in oil.  Don't get me wrong I'm okay with the oil since it's bacon but I didn't want jerky type bacon.  She did offer for them to make me another batch of bacon but I said it was not necessary that I'm done eating.  The good thing is she did remove the bacon charge so kudos to her.   BJ's is a chain restaurant so I'm sure I'll be returning.  Beer and Bar food is always better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa

Until I had to stop one of them , then my supposed to be waiter for the night finally showed up. Got my ordered. My drinks came out fast. But took them more than 30 mins or more to get a monkey bread pizookie and a California club flatbread out. How disappointing to see this. I understand the bread is hot.

Starting with the tortilla soup, taste was there however temperature was not. Seemed more like a room temperature / somewhat cold. The ribs tasted good, but was really hoping for great. Too many burnt char edges and unfortunately threw the taste buds off. Mashed potatoes could've also been better, tasted a little bland.

Suzanne C.,"San Diego, CA",19,70,27,4.0,11/18/2017,The food is good. Our server was very sweet and attentive until we got our meal but that all changed when she notified us that she was going on her dinner break and another server was going to take over. He only showed up after we were finished eating. We ran out of drinks by the time he showed up. We then ordered dessert and it took about 20-30 mins for us to get it. During that time no one picked up our empty dinner plates until he brought the dessert out and by that time we were out of drinks again. Then we had to wait forever to get the bill.

Ro S.,"Los Angeles, CA",51,109,4,1.0,6/13/2017,"Yelp! You need a zero star option. I am currently sitting here, as I have been for almost three hours. Either the slow dining movement has made it's way to BJ's or I got punked. Either way, something in the milk ain't clean, boo boo.  Came for a graduation party for about 20 and sat for over an hour before getting our entrees. And everyone still didn't get their food at nearly the same time. And once we got it? It was cold. Or the order was wrong. Ultimately, it was not of the same quality as other BJs.  And, as if that's not bad enough, we walked into the middle of BJ-gate. Basically, that's the equivalent of Biggie vs. Tupac of the serving world. I hope they can work it out because their rivalry, while entertaining, interfered with a family celebration and made it awkward.  And to add insult to injury, the bathroom isn't clean?! Nah. That's just nasty. Almost EVERY surface was wet. They tried to make it up to us by giving us free dessert. And guess what?! They even brought that out late. Free is too high a price at this BJ's.

From the very first second he's been nothing but polite and attentive. Answered all of our questions and just overall superb. My son insisted doing a yelp for him. There are some people who enjoy their job and value customer service and he is the perfect example of one of those people. Keep up the amazing service Donovan!

This is not my restaurant of choice to be honest, my son likes it here.  I'm not a fan of their pizza. I think it's way too doughy, the sauce is too sweet, and it lacks flavor. If we come here I usually order soup or salad. Don't shoot me, but I also do not get the hoopla over the famed pizookie either. It's way too sweet. To me it kind of tastes a little disgusting. I'd rather go out for gelato.  I think I prefer coming here during lunch. It's way too noisy at dinner time. I mean seriously noisy, and the drinkers get obnoxiously loud. I don't care to hear their opinions on sports or women's breast sizes shouted into my ear while I'm trying to eat. Especially if they're commenting on my server.

This was my first visit to this site and it was probably one of the worst. To begin, when we first got in the joint the guy up front was very nice and told me that we would be seated in five minutes- it took more like 15 but no big deal.  The table the we were seated at was in the back however our table was cleaned off in a rush and most of the food from the previous guests seemed to still be on the floor.  Getting stuck to the bottom of our shoes, but hey- still no big deal.  Our server was very pleasant she was a younger gal and got our orders right away. It took 10 mins to receive our drink and she forgot mine, no big deal. We asked then she received. Then about 45 mins pass by and we still haven't gotten our food- we look around and the table sitting next to us gets their food, mind you their party was seated a while after us. Finally our server asked the food runner where our food was because by that time it had been 1 hour that we had been sitting there waiting for our food. He apologized and our food was brought to us shortly after that. He explained that the kitchen was cray and we were understanding. Now, although everyone was pleasant I still feel the employees could've been a bit more attentive and at least let us know the dilemma. Other than that the food was delicious per usual.

Our name was called for a table and the hostess seated us.  I'm not sure if the servers in the section thought we were already helped since my husband had a beer on the table but nobody acknowledged us or came to take my drink order for 10 minutes.  We ordered a classic deep dish pizza, only the 9 inch since deep dish is denser and more filling.  I understand that deep dish usually takes longer to cook so we were prepared to wait. When it arrived 40 minutes later I was disappointed because after all that time the look and taste was comparable to a frozen DiGiorno pizza. Nothing like any true deep dish I've ever tasted. We decided to order a mint chocolate pizookie which tasted good but in my opinion overpriced. Basically $7.50 for a cookie with a scoop of ice cream.  I guess it's the novelty of it.  Overall, this is a good place for friends to meet up, grab some drinks and food but not a place I would go again for a date night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa?start=20

Michelle H.,"Santee, CA",16,21,8,3.0,12/3/2016,Update: After reading my initial review the manager contacted me and provided a gift card to return to the restaurant for another opportunity to try their food. Thank you Braxton for following up with me and it's reassuring to know you care and want to provide excellent customer service at your restaurant! I will visit again soon. I will also change the stars from 1 to 3. And if all goes well on my return visit I'll update again. Thank you! Friday 11/25/16: I ordered 3 pizookies to go for my son's 13th birthday. All 3 were burnt. Very disappointing given the fact that they are $8 a cookie. Not worth it! Had I checked them before leaving I would have returned them. I'm honestly surprised they felt ok serving them knowing they were all burnt. I even left a complaint online and they never reached out to me. They obviously don't care about their customer's experiences or satisfaction (or lack thereof). I won't be returning.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa?start=20

Jamey A.,"Escondido, CA",407,145,220,3.0,4/27/2016,"My husband and I came in for dinner with a few friends on a Sunday night. There was a 5 minute wait for our party of 4 which wasn't bad at all. We were seated at a booth near the front and after I sat down I noticed that there were dirty utensils and napkins underneath the table still. It wasn't really an issue to me and we just had them clear it out of the way. I really like that BJ's has a separate gluten free menu available with a variety of choices for appetizers and entrees. They also have my favorite GF beer, Omission as well as as the BJ's berry cider and another pear cider. My husband and I ordered the broccoli cheddar soup, caesar salad and a GF pizza to share. Our friends' ordered the wedge salad, sriracha mac and cheese and the grilled salmon with rice and asparagus.  The salads were both good. The lettuce was crisp with not too much dressing. The soup was terrible. It got cold really fast so it was thick and goopy and I couldn't eat it anymore. My friend loved her sriracha mac and cheese. I wish they had a GF pasta option so I could try it! Her bf loved the salmon too but thought his asparagus was weird because it was really skinny and soft. Our GF pizza was just okay. It definitely was not the best GF pizza I've ever had. I've honestly had better GF pizza from Dominos. The crust was too thin and hard and the toppings just fell off the crust every where. It was really disappointing. I didn't have enough room in my belly to try the GF pizookie but I hope to try it the next time I come in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa?start=20

Joanne A.,"Spring Valley, CA",61,35,332,4.0,6/21/2017,"We were a party of 6 at around 5:30 pm and the place looked a little busy.  I was told the wait could be around 20 minutes.  The staff at the counter offered to text me as soon as a table was ready.  We had a table ready in less than 10 minutes which was great! I wanted to take advantage of the happy hour menu but it turned out that we had to sit by the bar to take advantage of that.  Our server showed us the daily specials and today, Wednesday, the special was loaded burgers with unlimited fries.  We ordered the portobello Swiss, hickory brisket bacon, guacamole deluxe on a veggie patty (yes! vegetarian burgers were also an option) and a couple bacon cheeseburgers.  There was no need for extra fries because our meals very very filling. As busy as the place was, our server made sure we had our glasses refilled when needed and checked if we were enjoying our food.  Today was also one free pizookie per table day.  Oh, how I missed this dessert.  The warm gooey goodness of chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream did not disappoint.  We also ordered the white chocolate pizookie.  I have to admit, that was clever marketing I saw on Facebook.  I'm such a sucker for free food ads. That was the main reason I came here.  However, I was hoping to save a little bit more money by also taking advantage of the happy hour menu.  Nevertheless, we still enjoyed our meals. I should've Yelped this before when we came here months ago but one of the servers named Toby was top notch.  I'll never forget how he made our party felt when we came here for my client's birthday.  He had a great, personable demeanor.

Tina C.,"Casa de Oro-Mount Helix, CA",180,46,22,1.0,9/17/2016,"So this review has taken me over a week to fully think over. I wanted to write it as professionally as possible without blowing up.   I had made a reservation for 2 couples so 4 people at 7:30. Whomever I spoke with asked my name so I said,"" Tina... T-I-N-A."" She asked the name again, so I said and spelled it a second time. She verified the number as 4, we bid each other farewell and hung up.  1) We show up and check in for our res at 7:20, and are told we would have to wait 25-30 minutes. The whole point of making a reservation is so that you don't have to wait more than 5 (10, if I'm being gracious) minutes for a table.  2) They could not find my reservation on their computer. The gal said there was a res under the name of Lisa for 14 people, and that someone must have misunderstood me on the phone. I spelled my name out twice. We verified the party count twice. That is not a misunderstanding. That is incompetence.  3) The manager sat us and apologized. He claimed they were under staffed, yet I saw at least 10 wait staff, plus the 3 that were constantly on their personal cell phones.  4) The other couple we were with ordered a buffalo chicken pizza. It came out as a BBQ chicken pizza. Thank God none of us are allergic to anything in BBQ sauce. My shrimp pasta had 4 shrimp on it. I've paid less for shrimp and gotten more. I was also brought the wrong wine. 5) No compensation of any kind was offered after this nightmare date. Initially we had asked for two checks, 1 for each couple. The waitress brought us our receipt and told us we would have to mark who wanted what on which check.  As much as I used to love eating here (it has been our traditional double date spot for a year), after this experience, I cannot bring myself to come back to this restaurant. We will find a different BJ's to go to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa?start=40
Kim U.,"San Diego, CA",15,30,3,2.0,8/7/2017,"What on earth is happening to this BJ's?  Could it possibly be the extremely rude, dirty, unapologetic female manager with apparently no managerial or hospitality training and no social skills whatsoever is ruining everything???  Here's the lowdown about BJ's La Mesa; The stores GM, Braxton is truly fabulous.  He genuinely cares about the customers and the restaurant.  I have no doubt he's doing his best with what he's got to work with.  Also, the food (when and if you get it) is usually pretty decent.  We've had a few bad servers once in awhile and some messed up orders here and there, but the real complaint is with ""that"" woman manager.  Why and how she still has a job in the hospitality industry is puzzling.  We have seen her put her fingers in food, throw her servers under the bus, treat busboys horribly, had her been rude to us, make unprofessional comments, ignore guest requests and more.   I haven't taken the time to write a review because some of the experiences we've had are just unreal and I didn't feel it was worth my time.  I'm only writing now because it's my last straw and this latest fiasco didn't even involve us.   So the man and woman seated next to us apparently had cold, not great food.  They let their waitress know and were both very nice about it.  Waitress was super nice, promptly apologized, offered to replace their food and was letting the manager know.  It took 10-15 minutes and guess who comes out?  Yep-""that"" manager.  The guests explained the problem with the food to her and added a nice compliment about their waitress.  Manager spent all of one minute speaking with them in a not friendly tone whatsoever, offered ZERO apology, completely ignored the kind words about her wait staff and simply said she would take it off the bill and walked away.  Even with our past experience, our jaws hit the floor.  I turned to look at our neighbors who just looked dumbfounded.  It took another 10-15 minutes for them to receive their check.   Having ""that"" manager treat us regulars crappy is one thing-but it was entirely different seeing it happen to someone else.  We will be calling ahead to make sure she's not working before going back.  Pretty sad from a group that used to visit 1-3 times a week.  :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa?start=40

Seany F.,"San Diego, CA",1,12,,5.0,6/16/2017,"The Seany Foundation has been lucky enough to have food from BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse at many of our events throughout the years. From orders serving 20 people to orders serving 200 people BJ's has always come through with exceptional food and service.  In addition to what we've done with them over the years, over the past 6 months BJs has provided food for a monthly gathering for children affected by cancer. Each month this pizza is delicious, and the ever- rotating pizookie flavor is more delicious than the last. Though we must admit- the monkey bread is probably one of the best desserts we've ever had! And it is something the kids look forward to month after month.  Their pizza is hearty, and delicious and the pizookies are fun, sweet and tasty!  Not only is the food great, and consistent in quality, the service is always exceptional. The servers are always friendly and helpful to all of our needs.  The Seany Foundation could not be more pleased with the great food BJs has delivered throughout the years. And we would definitely suggest ordering from BJs for your next dinner out or big event.

My fiance had the salmon and I ended up having a dessert. The salmon was very good. The asparagus was awful. My fiance almost choked on it. It was inedible.  The sangria she had was to die for. She said she finally found a place that knows how to make one.  My dessert was so so. Although the vanilla bean ice cream was amazing.  Our service was excellent. Very courteous waiter and didn't forget about us ever.  We will come back and try other things.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa?start=60

The reason for my 4 stars is because my Date was freezing. We asked our server at least two times to turn down the air conditioning. I had goosebumps as well. Still freezing, my mom had to order hot tea to warm herself up. Adding insult to injury, we were charged $2.95 for her iced tea and another $2.95 for the hot one. Update:  Just a few hours after I posted this review, BJs General Manager contacted me. He was very apologetic about the cold temperature situation. This was part of his response:   Thank you so much for the reply, I apologize again about the temperature. I know it's not at all comfortable when you are trying to eat and enjoy a meal and you're cold. I forwarded you're yelp review to my management team.

Like many these days, I tend to shy away from red meat.  That said, their prime rib special (weekends, check it out) is a cut above.  Pun intended.  One plate, with sides, easily serves two!

Jazmin E.,"Spring Valley, CA",0,11,2,2.0,11/7/2016,"Our family has been coming to this restaurant for Friday night dinners for months now, not every Friday but enough because  the food is good, and usually the customer service is also. But this passed Friday we went to celebrate our friends bday, I called in advance because we were a very large party (18 people). They made the reservations no problem, we arrived alittle early just so we all were ready when they called us that our table was ready. Our Reservation was at 830, I went in about 8:15 or so just to let them know we were here just hanging out outside so they didnt think we didnt show up.  I knew we were a large party so I was not stressing on them seating us at EXACTLY 830 but roughly around it would have been nice. 8:45 rolls around i go inside and just ask what the status was on our table. one of the hostess informed me that they were just setting up the table for us. and she would come on out and get us as soon as they were done. Few minutes went by and they came and got us.  Sat down, and a waitress immediately started taking our drink orders. I thought wow thats awesome. After taking our drinks it took her FOREVER to bring us the drinks,and when she did some of the sodas were watered down almost like they were served and sat ona counter for a bit before she brought them to our table. I get it its one of her 18 of us. But i mean dont they know how to pace their time? this is what she does for a living? we couldnt have been her first LARGE party table before. Ask for help? I say this only because the resturant by this time was not busy  where i dont know why she didnt get help.  There was a bus boy which i wish i remembered his name seemed to be the one helping us with our needs because our waitress was no where to be found. he came and removed plates, gave us refills. at one point we asked out waitress several times for Napkins and silverware there were NONE on the table. when we sat down. then some other girl heard that we needed silverware and started to bring some over. I guess she ran out and said she would be back with more. She disappeared also, and when i seen her standing near our table she was on her phone.  all in all, the food was great but the service was the worst i have every experienced before.

A small group of rude teens tried to cut in front of us, it was obvious they were friends of the host and hostess at the podium. They were then promptly given a table before we were despite arriving after we did. 30 min later we inquired why we weren't seated yet, the other hostess said she didn't see our names on the list. Really? So we had a drink at the bar, waitress gave a long rambling excuse why she didn't want to add our bar tab onto our dinner bill, basically because other waiters were too lazy to keep track of it. At least she was honest I guess. Whatever. We were eventually seated and a waiter took our order... nice older gentlemen with a cross around his neck, but that was the last we saw of him until he delivered our bill. And then he never came back to pick up the bill, so we just paid the exact amount in cash, no tip. The food itself took a very long time to arrive, the manager did come and apologize but offered nothing in the way of compensation. Apology was hollow.

Chris A.,"Bonita, CA",123,63,8,2.0,3/11/2017,"Where to begin...I would have just written this off as a bad experience that was a serious comedy of errors by the staff of the restaurant, but I noticed that many other customers also had similar complaints  So what's the problem? Leadership and training.  From the beginning of the ""call ahead"" where we were told there was a 50 minute wait from the time of our call (turned out to be an hour and a half). Prior proper planning prevents poor performance.  The fact is that they didn't have a table and it appears that in an effort to prevent walkways  they give a time that they cannot live up to.. I knew there was a problem when the hostess told me that they were trying to get a table from outside to put one together for our group..finally we were given a choice of a booth for our group of 7 or wait around until a table became available. Having waited for so long my wife wanted to take the table (I ended sitting in a chair in the isle. So they are trying right? While I appreciate effort from the hostess (they were embarrassed) it got worse.  As we were sitting at the table my wife slipped and fell on the floor.  In an effort to turn over the tables quickly they did not clean up properly. Again this  is not  an anomaly, other patrons have complained about the same situation. The floor was wet and greasy.  While the effort was made to clean it up the experience at this restaurant was just going from bad to worse. So we make our order and we wait again. So...food on a busy night one should expect some additional wait time.. no big deal, but when it comes it should be hot and ready to eat. My wife's Pizza was barely warm and so I asked them to warm it up. They took the pizza and we waited again...10 minutes...15 minutes...20 minutes and finally the pizza. The young woman tells us that they dropped our other Pizza and had to remake it. No one came to tell us and so we waited. By now half of our party was done with food and we were staring at a large Pizza and we had had enough. The only reason I gave 2 stars was that the manager or supervisor came by and apologized and gave us a gift card for all the mistakes. In summary, the restaurant does not have bad food not great but it's what you expect when you go out to a chain establishment. But even a chain establishment should be organized in such a manner that they should be prepared for this type volume of service. Training, training, training. As a business owner and a manager of service personnel I would say that there is a deficiency in the area of organizational management at this establishment. The other reviews appear to back this up. Whomever has the opportunity to read and consider these reviews should rethink their training program. There's an old saying that anything worth doing is worth doing well and as of right now you are not!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa?start=100

Peter M.,"El Cajon, CA",107,3,,1.0,11/20/2016,"Im not one to complain...ever, but tonight we experienced the worst service i have ever had at a restaurant. And a corporate restaurant where money is spent to properly train each worker rather than just throw them on the floor and see how they work out!.. My wife, her friend,husband and child and I chose Bjs in La Mesa and once we walked in the door around 10 p.m we were greeted and seated very generously by the hostess. Then took our server about 8 minutes to finally greet us and take our drink order. Then it took about 10 minutes to receive half our drinks and not even the child drink yet ,the child drink and the rest of our drinks came another 4 minutes after that! Again we came in at 10 p.m and restaurant was not busy and there were plenty of servers on the floor since Bjs is open till 1 a.m. We ordered an app and our food, then that was the last we seen of our server..(till later on in the story). 10 min later our app comes,by expo.(ok timing) 20 min later again only half of our dinners came,by expo...then finally another 15 minutes the other half of our dinners come,by expo and since the first half waited to eat till the rest came ,their food was cold.. And none of us at the table have complained or asked why the time issues and where is our server yet, we were just trying to give them the benefit of the doubt and think maybe there is something happening we dont know about that is causing them to have food time and or server issues. By this time our drinks are empty and we have dirty plates crowding the table from the app. about 10 minutes after we are trying to eat our cold dinner without any condiments cause we havent been checked on and no drinks to wash anything down..we see a HUGE party, 35+ people walk in and before i knew for sure everybody would be busy i finally get up and seek a manager and simply ask for assistance at our table. And at this time i see our server walk out from the back and go straight to the party. So a manager and another server come prebus our table and just bring the condiments we needed 20+ minutes and about 6 more glasses of waters and tea that instead needed to just be  ""re-filled""..so now we have more stuff crowding our table again. Then didnt see the manager or any server for about another 25 min. Finally the ""expo"" comes and takes our plates and the manager comes and ask for any more drink refills from the bar, seriously? Way too late now! But friends husband orders a dessert and gets that brought out in about 12 minutes. Finally we get our check..from our original server!?!.and 1 check! when we asked in the very beginning to please split only 2 ways and he even took the order split in his notepad. So i wait 7 min for him to come back and ask him to fix it. But he never comes back so i get up and ask the manager to check me out and i mention that it was supposed to be split but im just going to pay the whole bill so we can leave now and specifically not to split it anymore. I go back to my table and then the original server walks up to the manager and has her split the checks and brings them back to me. Then i got a lil angry and told him i told the manager not split it and just run my card for the whole bill..he already ran it for half!!! So now he goes back and runs it again for a  second time for the other half of the bill!!! Then he proceeds to stay at the table and explain there was nothing he could do to of been of more help to us cause he was busy with the HUGE party! Then i got a lil more angry and said who was in charge of assigning the party to you and not assigning another server to take over our table? He said the manager but there was still nothing he could of done. Are you kidding me? We paid the full bill a lil over $100. We didnt even ask for any comps..we didnt even get an apology.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa?start=120

Lisa B.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,1,1.0,10/7/2017,"This restaurant has gone completely down hill. We have been eating here for years, and it was always good although a bit over pricey..we didn't mind..the last couple of times though, I noticed the quality of the food and the service has gone completely down hill. The portion sizes have been cut, noticeably on the chicken lettuce wraps, wilted lettuce and hardly any chicken in the mixture. Not enough for all the wilted wraps, especially for a whopping 11.95 appetizer. The honey crisp chicken salad had half the amount of chicken it used to have. Last night We ordered 2 meals through grub hub. We were charged full price but only received 1 meal. Supposingly BJs  told the driver that they were out of Prime rib but didn't bother to let the Customer know this! No one called to ask us if we would like something else. We waited over an hour for our meals, to only receive 1 of them. The food we did receive, soggy slaw with the  over cooked dry and cold tiny 5 piece root beer ribs . I had to call grub hub to complain and ask for a refund on the meal I didn't receive! They had to call BJ's to find out 'what happened' and ask for a refund on the Prime rib. I still got stuck with the 12.00, 20% tip I paid for 2 meals..I will never eat at this BJ's again. this is No reflection on grub Hub..It's all on BJ's LaMesa..I should have known better than to order take out, when eating at the restaurant was terrible the last time..and I am not a complainer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa?start=80

Michelle C.,"Vista, CA",37,113,182,3.0,5/10/2017,"On May 5, 2017, I was with my hubby family side for lunch.  We all got there around 1130-noon. It was 8 adults and 2 kids. My point of view I don't know why we had to wait to get our table. It wasn't as busy yet.  After awhile once we sat down we all orders our drinks. I'd order dr. Pepper, once we got our drinks I had a sip of it. I realize it wasn't dr.pepper, I made my hubby try it and he said it was a diet drink so then I waited for the waitress to come back and tell her. They finally got the right drink. We all notice at the table there were no utensils at the table. They finally provided us the utensil before the food arrive.  My hubby utensils was dirty which had food still stuck on the forks and knives. My sister in law, mother in law ordered some type of salad which had no dressing on it. We all asked if she wanted dressing but she didn't want to fuss about it, so she said no.  The waitress were next to non existence throughout our time there.  At the end of the meal I asked for my drink in a Togo cup she never brought it to me, so I was like whatever. That was the worst customer service I ever had there. The waitress name was Paige b. So I finally saw my email which showed a response to my review that I posted. I read it and the manager Braxton wrote back, saying  he wanted to talk to me. So I decided to call him back and see what he wanted to say to me. He said he apologized for what happened, and wanted my feedback to improve the restaurant for the near future.  I was surprised what he gave me because I told him it wasn't just me that was in the party.  He gave a good amount of gift cards. I provided him my email address so that he can email me the gift cards.

I don't know how, I have theories, although it doesn't really matter 'cause it happened. After standing around like morons for far too long, we asked again about our wait and were told that we were not on the list... The front door staff got us seated shortly after, so, ok... Then after waiting for what now seemed like eternity, I finally got up and stopped one of the waitresses that were doing their best to skirt our table and asked if she could find who our server was. She reluctantly said that ""apparently she would be our waitress..."". Again, ok. Our food was all pretty simple: burgers, fries, salads, pizza, etc. after 45 minutes and the last of my hair falling out, a different server brought our meals. The burgers seemed to be the hold up, because they were pretty fresh. Everything else had obviously been waiting for the burgers, because it all pretty much sucked... We usually hit this place a few times while we are in town, but it is time to find a new spot. I feel like I'm losing an old friend, but I can't go on paying $80+ for such a poor experience.

We got there and had about a 15 minute wait (not bad considering no reservation on a holiday night). The staff (from those that greeted us, seated us, waited, served and said good bye to us) we're very friendly and helpful. It felt like we were seated in less than 15 minutes.  Our server, Trey, was very nice and attentive throughout our meal (even though he was serving a big party and serval smaller parties around us).  I ordered one of my favorites, The Great White, in a mini pizza and had their root beer (one of the only places I'll order root beer really). My boyfriend ordered the country fried steak meal with an Ultimate Long Island iced tea (also a good choice and can hit me pretty quick!). We didn't have to wait too long for our foodies to come out and our server was still good on trying to keep everyone's drinks filled. The foodies was hot and tasted like foodies I was craving (translation=it was good lol). My boyfriend enjoyed his drinks and country fried steak (also took a nibble and liked how it was made). We also made enough room for some pizzookies! We ended up ordering the trio so we could try different flavors (the triple chocolate, cookies and cream and the salted caramel). All of which were awesome and satisfying to many people's sweet tooth.  Overall, even though this location got pretty busy, the service didn't suffer and the foodies was good.

We spent a good amount of money there as we always do, but i don't mind because i LOVE the food. Well on Monday night , i was craving the little garlic rolls, so my husband ordered me some prior to going to the movies, and i was definitely a happy pregnant woman eating them in route to the movies. Well on Tuesday, i tried to order some and after being on hold for 10 minutes, the lady said she couldn't sell me just the rolls. I didn't understand why because i had literally purchased them the night before and money wasn't the issue. Hell, i would have paid 10$ for a half dozen. That's over a dollar for each roll.  I am pregnant, and anyone who knows anything about pregnant cravings know when you want something, that's just what you want ! well yesterday, Wednesday, my husband called in and tried to order them again, because that's all that i want, and after crying on Tuesday because of the fact that this damn place denied to sell them to me, an employee by the name of ARIA J, was able to inform me, that they offered 4 rolls and marinara sauce for $4.95. I was very close to literally never ever eating here again, and i was going to do a horrible review because i am an emotional pregnant woman who was refused some rolls. lol But Aria made it better for me.

Kelli S.,"Honolulu, HI",1902,1170,9782,4.0,11/12/2014,"I've been to this BJ's La Mesa location twice since moving to San Diego, and because I went by myself (twice), I never had to wait long. The first time, I went on ""National Pizookie Day"" to get my free Pizookie ... the second time, I just went to try the new ""S'Mores"" Pizookie that had recently debuted. Because I went in the late afternoon/early evening during both trips, I didn't have to wait long to get seated and served.  Here are my thoughts regarding the ""S'Mores"" Pizookie, as well as the classic ""Original"" and some of the other Pizookie creations I have tried thus far: ""BJ's Peanut Butter S'mores"": I have to admit, I was a bit doubtful of this ""S'Mores"" Pizookie because I don't like lots of marshmallow ... in any of my desserts. But I was pleasantly surprised and delighted with BJ's take on the classic campfire treat because THIS version featured a layer of creamy peanut butter. That's right--the BJ's twist features a Ghirardelli triple chocolate cookie (one of my favorites because it's super chocolaty) topped with a peanut butter layer and completed with marshmallow fluff that's baked to a golden finish and vanilla bean ice cream. I thought the marshmallow layer would be overwhelming and too much for me to handle, but I was wrong. I rather enjoyed the toasted marshmallow layer and was able to pair it nicely with the rich, chocolate cookie and rapidly melting ice cream. I felt that the vanilla ice cream melted quicker than usual while I was enjoying this treat, but probably because of the added heat from the torched marshmallow fluff. I very much enjoyed this ""S'Mores"" Pizookie and hope it won't leave the menu anytime soon. The peanut butter layer truly revolutionizes this treat and makes a world of difference. I think the only thing that would make this dessert even better is if graham cracker crumbs were used somehow, maybe to sprinkle the top of the Pizookie. ""Cookies 'n Cream Pizookie"": I've ordered this Pizookie once to share with a friend, and it was definitely reminiscent of OREO cookies. This creation features a rich, moist chocolate cookie that seems to be infused with OREO bits (or at least, it had a more cookies 'n cream-ish flavor). It's then topped off with three scoops of vanilla bean ice cream and a dollop of creamy mousse. While I'm not a huge fan of mousse, this cookies 'n cream mousse wasn't too bad and the dollop was small; it didn't overwhelm or suffocate the entire dessert. I loved the OREO-like flavor of this cookie--definitely a different texture and taste from the other Pizookies--and it was just perfect when paired with the vanilla ice cream. I think the only way to make this treat even better is to actually use cookies 'n cream ice cream instead of regular vanilla.   ""BJ's Original Pizookie"": When I'm not feeling all fancy and just want a tried-and-true favorite, I just go for the ""BJ's Original Pizookie."" Though you can choose between chocolate chunk, peanut butter and white chocolate macadamia nut when it comes to the cookies, I always do a hybrid of chocolate chunk and peanut butter (you CAN do half and half). I usually just leave the vanilla ice cream alone, but you can also substitute the vanilla with chocolate, if you prefer. But really, this chocolate-peanut butter cookie medley truly brings out the best of both worlds when it comes to Pizookies.   ""Salted Caramel Pizookie"": I've ordered this dessert to share twice, and I have to admit, my first experience getting it was awesome, but the second time, this Pizookie was too salty for my liking. I would expect the dessert to have a sweet-and-salty balance, just because it DOES include salty caramel, but I think the second time I had it, someone went overboard on the salt, which makes this sort of a hit-or-miss Pizookie in my opinion and I would probably opt for one of the other sweeter varieties instead. But it features caramel cookie dough (which was very delicious), pretzel bites (great addition) and white and dark chocolate chips. Already, this Pizookie has a lot going for it, since it features many elements not present in the other Pizookies. It's topped off with caramel sauce, vanilla bean ice cream and a Ghirardelli SQUARES dark chocolate. I'm not sure where the chefs went wrong the second time I ordered this sweet-and-salty treat, but I felt like I was biting into a salt mine. However, I'm glad that I did have a great first experience tasting this salty caramel treat. The cookie itself was great, and I enjoyed the crunch from both the pretzel bits and the white and dark chocolate chips. The ice cream paired nicely with the dish, while the salted caramel sauce added just the hint of saltiness that the sweet treat needed to make it unique.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa?start=160
Stephanie M.,"La Mesa, CA",0,12,,1.0,5/21/2017,The staff is nice and the food is decent.  The issue is that the restaurant is not very clean.  We've been there twice in the last couple of months.  Both times the cleanliness has been unacceptable.   The bathrooms were disgusting.  We actually had to let the hostess know both times!  This last time the dishes weren't clean either.

Tara J.,"San Diego, CA",279,9,,2.0,1/24/2016,"This review is only for the curbside pick up.  Tried twice to order food and pick it up, but both times were a disappointment.  Both times, the food was soggy, semi-cold, and tasted microwaved. We've always waited for at least 20 minutes once we've parked and called. Last time we went they missed half our order, but brought out the pizookie and ice cream 15 minutes before the rest came- so of course the pizookie was cold and the ice cream was melted. Overall just really disappointed, because I've never had a bad experience with BJ's.

Spoke with a manager who apologized and said would work on getting a table together which brought our wait time down to about 20 minutes. Took at least an hour to get our food and another hour before we could flag down our server, who in the mean time sat down with a couple dining to chat for awhile, to bring us our check.

We usually go to the BJ's in Mission Valley because it isn't that busy but the Grossmont location is much closer to home. We called ahead to put our name on the list. When we arrived, we waited about 5 minutes and our name was called. From the moment we sat down, our server Nathan was AMAZING. He was so attentive, polite, caring, and genuine. He checked in on us to make sure we were doing well and that my kids had everything that they needed. He even asked if we wanted our kids food right away or if we wanted it made shortly before our meals so their meals had time to cool down before coming to the table. He was so sweet, funny, sincere, and all around an awesome server. These days, in all fields of work, people lack customer service skills, but not Nathan. People are too quick to complain when they receive bad service, but don't take the time to give praise when they receive great service.

It was pretty good, I thought they kind of cheap out on the beef/meat. There wasn't too much and it was like flakes of it, not big big clumps or anything. Their salad wraps are always a good choice as well.  BJ's is a good chain restaurant. Decent service, great bar area, good selection of beers, and all types of different dishes to choose from.

At the end when we were ready to leave he made sure we were satisfied with everything and of course we were.

This is the one place that we always agree on whenever we crave sweets in the La Mesa area. We typically get the white chocolate macadamia nut cookie, and the three of us can actually share one order. I know, that sounds blasphemous considering how DELICIOUS they are ...but we're trying to lose 5 pounds.... See what I did there? :) #MeanGirls My little brother and sister share a love for their new burgers. The extra dose of guacamole won them over. Personally, I've grown to really love the wings here. They are crunchy to the right amount, and I love the seasoning here. They have new flavors for the dry wings, and they ALL tastes great. Everyone needs to check 'em out!!  I docked one star because the service at this restaurant is never consistent. We've had some of the crappiest waiters, and some of the best as well.

Benjamin C.,"San Diego, CA",2,1,1,2.0,11/13/2015,"I used to be a regular customer of BJ's, moreso while living in Los Angeles. Based on a few experiences at this location years ago, likely would have rated ~4 stars for price, food quality, customer service, and overall value. Unfortunately, this was a BJ's experience unlike any other I've had. Arrived at ~8:10pm this last Monday night, and was promptly seated; It was not a busy Monday night. Drink orders went fine and delivered in reasonable time. Entrees were ordered by ~8:20pm. A little after 9pm, began to be concerned regarding where the food was, especially considered the restaurant was largely vacant. Food arrived a couple minutes after complaining. My friend and I had both ordered the Mahi Mahi taco plate, and substituted one of the two fish tacos with a shrimp taco. Seconds after my friend had bit into her fish taco, she exclaimed ""this fish as BAD!"" Having worked in a high-end seafood restaurant for years, I was unwilling to take her word and took a bite of my own fish taco. Yep, it was bad alright. RANCID, would be the correct term for this spoiled, not to mention cold, fish. This review would be a solid 1 star had it not been for BJ's management offering to purchase a replacement meal. Because if was 9:20pm at this point, I declined and received a gift card for future use. Based on that I debated between giving 2 or 3 stars, but as Yelp describes 2 as ""Meh.

The server said it's still their most popular dish and customers would revolt if they ever took it off the menu! Two nice size pieces of deboned chicken breast, lightly breaded, seasoned very well with shaved Parmesan and a wonderful lemony buttery sauce on it. Still delish. I am a saucy girl, so I asked for a little extra sauce on the side to dip my broccoli and mashed potatoes in. Broccoli cooked perfectly and comes pretty plain, so the sauce was a good dipper. Their potatoes though.....so dense and not a lot of flavor. I do remember them like this and I wonder why they can't make a lighter version, would be SO much more appealing. I think next time I might just ask for fries or a baked potato if they have it. Lost a star for that.  Service was spot on, but I went at a very late lunch hour, so they weren't busy at all.

I've come here twice in a few months and it's always the same thing. They seat you and then it takes the waiter forever to come assist you or even ask for a drink.  Tonight we got our starter salad and had no utensils to eat with it. I asked the server for some place settings. The one I got had a terribly bent prong on the fork. I waited forever for a waiter to walk by to ask for a new one. He agreed he would. I never got the fork. He came by 10 min later to ask how we were doing. I reminded him that I still needed the fork and he made some joke about forgetting.  Our food was great but we had to ask every time to get our drinks refilled. I also had to ask three separate times to get a side of dressing.

I'd say we average eating here 25 times a year and we've always had great food and great service, with a few exceptions throughout the years(it happens). Tonight we had a play at the kids school that didn't end until 8 so we decided to use curbside pickup for the first time. Order was supposed to be ready at 8:15, we arrived at 8:10 and called to let them know we had arrived and to pay so we could get the kids home, fed and in bed(they're 6 months, 7 & 9 years old). They didn't come out to take the card until 8:20 and said the food will be right out. 8:35 rolls around and the guy comes out with just our card, no food, and says they messed up the kids cheese pizza(didn't put cheese on it?), he said we took those off the bill and the food will be right out. 8:45 he brings the food and we head home. When we get home I noticed my pizza was missing the garlic and cilantro and my wife's baked potato had no topping on the side. No sour cream, butter, cheese or anything.... and of course the only meals that were hot was the kids pizzas. Very disappointing having to microwave our meals after sitting in the car waiting for 35 minutes with a baby screaming and daughter crying because she's hungry and tired.

Jen H.,"San Diego, CA",486,237,1113,4.0,12/6/2013,"Yeah- it's a chain restaurant. And a pretty dang good one ! Ever not know what you want to eat??? Promise you'll most likely find something here ! They have a fairly huge menu! I think I have been here at least 20 times and had only great experiences. There was a few times when slower than usual - but that's understandable given how busy this place can be - and that's really just a few times out of the many many I've been.  Came here for the bajillionth time two days ago for lunch. Lunch specials are 11-3 Monday to Friday and they have a great selection ! My favorite is the Southern Fried Chicken for $6.95- it's the perfect portion and it's soooooo delicious. It's delicious mashed potatoes garnished with corn ...a delicious tender fried chicken is nestled on top and a delicious sauce is poured over. This time I got the spaghetti and meat sauce for $7.95 and it included a salad or soup. I love pasta ! Pasta was al dente and sauce was great- huge portions for lunch. Also included two garlic breads. Score! I got the chilli...it was mediocre at best ... not horrible but nothing to rave about. It was a simple chilli- not much flavor to it. I also tried the corn fritters appetizer. For $2.95 ... I couldn't be disappointed no matter what. This appetizer though was amaze-balls(literally !) - it was corn balls with bacon aoili..... Sooooooo good. Came with 4 pieces. Definitely recommend this - esp at such a great price. Knocked down a star because while all their food is pretty good - a lot of it can also be pretty bland and flavorless. Easy classics like spaghetti, Alfredo , soups , and breadsticks are good but just not that great. Luckily great prices and atmosphere make up for most of that :)  Always a hostess/host at the front which is nice. I never once had to wait and look around for someone. Great other selection of food (including their famous deep dish pizzas), unique beers with a great selection, and of course their famous pizookie dessert ... Yum.  All around a great place for lunch, dinner, and happy hour. Service is always pleasant. They do their job- nothing extraordinarily spectacular. Nothing less.

Asked for a medium today & received a well done steak. Still yummy, but was overcooked. The same thing happened a few months back when we ordered steak for lunch.

Good choice on our part though. Four flavors of warm cookie topped with scoopfuls of ice cream on top. We got red velvet, raspberry white chocolate, cookies in cream and regular chocolate chip. It was delicious the first few bites. The combination of warm cookie and cold ice cream was SO good. Who would of thought hot and cold ever go together? The sugar eventually gets to you though as it is a humongous dessert. The red velvet was good but was definitely the sweetest. The raspberry white chocolate was good. We only got a hint of raspberry but the white chocolate definitely complimented it. The cookies and cream kinda tasted like a flat brownie. It's good if you like flat brownies. And surprisingly, the normal classic chocolate chip was my favorites. The cookie had a half baked taste but who doesn't like cookie dough and cookies? And I loved the warmness of a fresh out of the oven cookie. We had to wait a little longer because they actually burnt our first one. They came out and let us know that it was going to be a little while longer because they wanted serve us a good one. Fortunately, we didn't mind the wait and found it funny that they burnt our cookie. Like the description says, it's good for a party of 5 or more.

Kelly P.,"San Diego, CA",106,52,15,1.0,8/5/2014,"I dined here tonight after hiking cowles mtn. We were seated quickly and our drink orders were taken by our waiter, Matt, quite promptly. Unfortunately,  things started going downhill. Our beer and appetizer, the avocado rolls, we're delightful. My partner ordered a burger and i wanted the sirloin. We both requested them medium. When they came, his was well done and mine was medium well. Back in April this happened to my partner who ordered his steak medium and got a well done one. In April we complained to the waiter who brought the manager out and he made things right by getting him another steak. Since the issue was resolved, I did not yelp about it. This situation was handled differently. I'm not sure if it was due to how many tables Matt needed to tend to, or the lack of communication between wait staff, and management. When I told Matt about my displeasure with the food, he said he would have the manager come see us. My partner finished his meal and still no manager. So I sipped on my water and Matt tells us that the manager is in the back cooking (hmmm, could he be the one who cooked my steak?). I tell him it's okay and that we would just like the check. He ask if we want to wait because ""it will only take a few minutes"". I informed him that we may wait but we would still like the check.  The real kicker was when he turned to my partner(who is male) and tells him explicitly that ""I'll get the check for YOU"". Not you guys, just my partner, I guess the assumption is since he is male, he must be paying. It really turned me off, as it was me asking for the check the whole time, and also me who planned on paying for the food his manager overcooked, and also for the tip that I left him. At that point, I really wanted to wait for the manager, but a few minutes after we had paid and we're still not seen by the manager, it was decided we'd better just leave.  Long story short, if you want your steak/burger medium, order rare. And avoid this place unless you are okay with customer service inconsistencies. If you read my other reviews, I gloat about many establishments that I am pleased with,  but tonight BJ's wasn't one of them. I wouldn't have written this review if the manager had addressed my concerns while i was there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa?start=240

Our service is often great, but our waitress (Gabriela) decided to go AWOL and we did not see her until she brought out check.

The salads are good if you are looking for something healthy. If you are looking for something not so healthy they have a thing called a bazookie. It is a chocolate chip cookie that is cooked fresh and served with ice cream and a chocolate on top. It is the most amazing desert you will ever have.  One tip would be if you are catching a movie at the theater on the other side of the parking lot you can get your order to go and the movie theater will let you take it into your movie with you.  Another tip is if you call BJ's when you are on your way to the restaurant they will put your name on the waiting list.

Trish C.,"Lakeside, CA",0,4,2,1.0,6/23/2015,"Food was decent... Crappy service. Shame on waitress Carla for her behavior; shame on manager Ryan for allowing it.  My husband and I went to BJ's at Grossmont for an early dinner last Friday night. It was crowded but we got seated fairly quickly.  On our table was a card advertising happy hour specials. We checked the time, we were within the time frame, so we decided to order drinks off of that menu. To be clear, the happy menu was on our table in the dining area, and there was nothing on the card stating that that menu or those prices were only available in the bar area. It took a while for the waitress, Carla, to actually make an appearance at our table. When we tried to order off the happy hour menu, she said we could only get that menu/those prices at the bar. The difference in prices for the drinks we wanted on the happy hour menu versus the regular menu was about $10. I asked Carla if there was any reason we couldn't order our food through her off the regular menu, but get our drinks ourselves at the bar. She said we could do it, but clearly did not like that idea.  And here's where our experience at BJ's turned bad - After my husband went to get our drinks, Carla, the waitress, pretty much stopped waiting on our table to the point of rudeness.  When my salad arrived, the silverware set at my seat was dirty - I mean the fork was crusty-dirty, it should never have been wrapped up. This was not her fault, of course (unless she rolled the silverware) but it was her job to replace it once it was pointed out to her.  It took me a while to get her attention to the point she would come over to the table. I finally flagged her down and asked her for clean silverware. Not only did she NOT apologize for the dirty silverware, she left me sitting there for several minutes with my salad in front of me and no way to eat it - all while she went to other tables in the section, smiling, chatting with other tables, other customers. Me, not so much. Without slowing down, she finally scooped up the dirty set without stopping, on her way to somewhere/someone else, and several minutes later, dropped ( and I do mean ""drop"") off a new set, again on her way to someone/somewhere else - all without pausing, all without a word. It was obvious at this point that she was punishing us for getting our own drinks.  The food was brought by the expediter. Carla never once checked back at our table. She avoided our gaze, never made eye contact, never stopped to ask or inquire if everything was OK or if we needed anything else. She would avert her eyes when walking past our table. I am not kidding or exaggerating, I wish I were. She was that rude and nasty. Meanwhile, she was smiling and seemingly happily waiting on every other table in her section. The difference in service between our table and the other tables was very noticeable.  At the end of our meal, after we had been sitting there for some time with empty plates in front of us. She finally came up and without looking at me, addressed my husband and asked if we wanted our plates cleared away. And when she brought the bill, she again addressed him, ignoring me, and gave him the bill. I picked up the bill, put my card into the folder and set it down on my side of the table. She picked it up with out a word, and when she returned it for signature, she AGAIN placed it on his side of the table, ignoring me, not making eye contact with me, not speaking to me.  She never thanked us, never said any pleasantries, nothing. IMO, with that attitude, she had no business waiting tables in a sit down restaurant.  Before leaving I stopped and spoke to Ryan, the manager. And, although he apologized for the bad service, and even said that it wasn't a big deal to order off the happy hour menu in the dining room, I felt at the very least we should have been offered something, some kind of compensation, but that didn't happen.  Carla, it was obviously your intention to give us bad service and to negatively impact our meal and our night - and you succeeded, so good for you. Do you feel better now? And shame on manager Ryan for allowing this kind of service in his restaurant. If it happened to us, I'm sure it has happened to other customers as well. Shame on both of you. You're in the service industry, have some pride. I'm not quite sure what number of stars to rate this place, as the food was decent, but the service we received was really awful and rude - how does that translate in stars? I finally decided on one star, because the crappy service had such a negative impact on our food and evening.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa?start=260

Not as juicy, but more flavor than a well done patty would have.  Looks like they're known for their deep dish pizza and pizooki. I've had neither, but I'll definitely be returning to try more!

I was excited to come here for the free pizookie on your birthday as was advertised, and so believing in their credibility, I came to BJ's. While I had no intention to dine in that night, I was very clear to the front of the house that I just wanted to receive the free pizookie. The front said OK, that I could get it at the bar where it was open seating, since the house was packed. So I sat at the bar. The bartender asked me what I'd like, and I said the free pizookie. Then he said that I actually had to dine-in in order to get it. Perturbed, as the ad did not mention any such stipulation, I proceeded to ask what was the cheapest thing on the menu. The barman said it was probably chips and salsa for $7. After that, I decided to leave. Essentially it was $7 for a pizookie that was supposed to be free.  Even though I wasn't going to eat here, I was offended at their lack of credibility. The front and the bar told me contradictory things; the free pizookie was in fact, not free at all!

My husband and I were visiting from out of town and we decided to take our brothers and his sister here...first of all we were outcasts in the back corner with no one around us. Then it took thirty minutes to get someone's attention just so we can order drinks. I repeat FOR DRINKS. And all I wanted was water because I was so thirsty from our previous time at the beach.  Then when we ordered food our waitress corrected my husband twice in a condescending tone and as soon as she went to me she asked if I wanted to be skipped as soon as I was going to talk because she was rushing. When my soup came out it wasn't even warm!! Good but come on who likes cold soup. And by the time we got our entree we were so hungry and as soon as we start to dig in we realized none of us have silverware and napkins!!! And of course our waitress was gone. The manager was nice enough to knock off 25% off our bill and throw in two free pizookies but it honestly should of been completely  free. I mean if we're willing to pay $17 a plate which I could make in the comfort of my own home for way less then I don't expect to get worse service than a fast food restaurant. And when we ordered the pizookies we asked if she could bring spoons since our silverware doesn't come with them and we said it all nice and then of course in a rude tone she was like it comes with it so do you want extra silverware? I was all nice and said no but in my head I was thinking well she must think pastas and spaghettis are finger foods because we didn't get silverware for that until we asked. And when we told her about the pizookies being free for us she said again in a rude tone really? Because he didn't tell me that. So we were like just go talk to him because we were so fed up with her. And she was like I will. Of course she came out all like I'm sorry he didn't tell me. Then the pizookies were cold!!! I only had pizookies at the BJ'S in LA but every time I got a pizookie (which is a lot) it was fresh and so warm that when you take a piece of the cookie the chocolate chips were melted and gooey. If your reading this I'm sorry it's so long but if you think about it, if my post is this long that means to many things went wrong. I'm sure not all the staff is like this but this was our experience and that one waitress honestly ruined BJ'S for me and I've been going there for years.

GlutenFreeS. D.,"San Diego, CA",40,88,,1.0,9/21/2013,"Two and half hours.  That's how long it took the four of us to get a simple one-course meal.  To be fair, we did ask our waiter two simple questions:  1) Was there a way to make a vegan pizza (my step daughter is vegan), and 2) did the kitchen take special care not to cross-contaminate for gluten free options during preparation.  We then ordered some appetizers and waited for our waiter to return with our answers so we could order our meal.  Well, the appetizers never arrived.  And neither did our waiter.  After about a half hour a new waitress appeared at our table (our first waiter was still in the restaurant, just pointedly avoiding us).  Our new server seemed completely unaware of either our appetizer order or our food questions, and she got busy getting those resolved. ....Another half hour and our appetizers arrived.  But still no answers to our questions.  So I went in search of a manager.  After standing for ten minutes or so by hostess station, ""Sean"" finally arrived.  I put my questions to him and, to my shock and amazement, he couldn't answer either one.  ""I'll have to check on that,"" he said, and disappeared.  I got the distinct impression that ""Sean"" was not the sharpest tool in the shed to begin with, and that perhaps the stress of his management position was a little beyond his capacity.  So I waited a few more minutes, and, when it was clear Sean wasn't returning anytime soon, I returned to our table.  At long last the waitress was now taking our order. Since we couldn't confirm any info regarding our dietary needs, I took a risk and ordered a GF pizza, and my step-daughter ordered a salad.  Another half hour later our main entrees began to trickle in...not together, but separately over a twenty-minute period.  It was ridiculous.  Then, as we approached the two hour mark and the last order (my step-son's regular pizza) hadn't yet arrived, I waived down our waitress.  ""Oh no!"" She declared, ""I completely forgot to put in his order!"" You get the picture. This wasn't the worst dining experience I've ever had...my GF pizza was actually pretty good and everyone else was happy with their meal as well (once the dishes finally arrived).  But the service was incredibly bad, even for San Diego's low standards. Lastly, I would also warn against ordering at the bar.  The bartender had little training and no clue about any of the drinks we wanted, or how to customize a drink, or even how to fix a drink he failed to mix properly.  My margarita was truly disgusting. So...we won't be eating at this location again, but hopefully this review can help the folks somewhere in the BJ management chain realize they have a self-destructive spiral occurring at this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa?start=300

Shannon C.,"Lakeside, CA",11,18,4,3.0,12/30/2014,I'm not impressed with the customer service here or the curb side (un) service. They need to get rid of it altogether or have someone REALLY responsible for the task. Everyone wanted to pass the buck on who was going to help me AFTER I got out and went inside. Mind you I placed the order at 11:45 for a 4:15 pick up?  Had pizza in hand at 4:45 :( not impressed and the pizza was less than the service. Very skimpy on the toppings!  Not sure about going back.

Jonelle O.,"Olympia, WA",180,472,534,3.0,11/18/2013,"I don't know, it's BJs. I don't like to review chains but I should note that we had a fantastic Google Deals voucher that got us two salads or soups (we chose wedge salads), any medium pizza (we chose the BBQ chicken), and any P'zookie thing (we chose chocolate chip) for $19.95. I mean, come on! How could we not go there and eat all that for $20.  It was pretty good and well worth the $20 but that's my main gripe with BJs. The food isn't that bad, but just like all these other chain restaurants, they charge way too much for the quality of food you're getting. If every item on the menu was about $3-$5 cheaper we'd probably come here for a quick bite more often. But as it is, paying $16 for meh fish and chips is not worth it to us. We'd rather go to a locally owned business and spend the same money there for halibut fish and chips. You get my drift? It's not bad food, but there is much better food to be had for the same amount of money or less. Their beer wasn't that great either. I mean, it's nice that they're trying -- what with being in San Diego, the land of craft beer. But nope. A big miss.

I guess we should have know better than to go when we called 3 weeks ago for a 6:00 reservation for 11 people and was told we couldn't because they had a party of 50 coming in. We took the 5:30 reservation and the nightmare soon began. We were basically ignored through out the whole dining experience, when they would come and bring a few plates at a time they would place them down and hightail it out of there. It seriously took me 10 minutes to flag anyone down for a glass of water. My sons steak was ordered med/rare and came out med/well again another 10 minutes to get anyones attention. The steak was reordered and it took 20 minutes to come back to the table, by that time the rest of the table has finished their dinner.  It took us 2 hours to get out of there.

Jeff L.,"San Diego, CA",157,219,69,3.0,9/14/2013,"This review is for the bar area only.  I went here to watch a game and grab a few drinks. For Thursday there were happy hour specials as well as specials during the nfl game. I think the beer deal was 3.50 for their house brews, which was pretty good. I got the blonde ale and it was really smooth.  The prices outside of the happy hour menu were a little on the high side but not outrageous. We paid $17-18 for a half rack of ribs. The ribs were ok but not worth 17-18 bucks.  The real deal is that if you are going to watch a big game, they will have a huge tv dedicated. That is really cool but the atmosphere was pretty lame. Maybe the game was just pathetic but honestly the crowd was too eclectic to have any passion behind it.  Bottom line is that for an nfl game we got good drinks, average food, average service, and an average viewing experience. For all that, we paid $50 which doesn't seem like a lot but considering we got the ribs and that took up almost 40% of our bill we could have gotten a better value for our money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa?start=340

Every time someone walked in or out a foul stinch would emit from the cleaning/cook area. Then I happened to look inside one of the times (and quite a few times after) and saw the messiest area ive ever seen in my life ontop of the smell. So that grossed me and my wife out.

I asked to speak with the manager her name was Nastasia  she was very rude passed me twice and pretended not to see me until I got another waitress to get her for me she seem frazzled, annoyed, irritated, could care less,I explained I am a regular customer who comes often here with my family and I was surprised that there salads were so small for amount we payed for them and if I knew they had changed the portion I would never had ordered them. She blamed corporate for the change and removed only 2 out of 5 and walked away I just felt she should have removed all of them and at that point the next time I come I would not order them anymore.

Jessica S.,"San Diego, CA",235,920,2051,4.0,12/24/2013,"My BJ's Restaurant count stands at 3, with this most recent visit being number 3. Despite the fact that it was the last Friday before Christmas, and the fact that we were in a mall setting, the restaurant had a table for us surprisingly quickly. The answer to our question, ""How long is the wait for 2?"" was ""There is no wait."" Can't ask for more than that! The restaurant was pretty packed - and loud - so I was amazed that we were shown to a booth towards the back of the restaurant after less than five minutes. Our waiter was at our table within a minute, and he had our drink order back to our table within two minutes. The best part? I asked for water with lime (because I can be finicky), and when our waiter (Benjamin) came back to the table, he said that they were slicing new limes, and that he'd bring some more by in a bit. Being the cynical ass that I am, I immediately wrote that comment off as fluff, and resigned myself to having one teeny-tiny lime floating in my glass with the ice cubes. Lo and behold, not two minutes later, Benjamin comes back with a ramekin filled with lime wedges...all for me! Sometimes, it ain't so bad being wrong. =) For dinner, I ordered the Moroccan Spiced Salmon and my husband got the shrimp tacos. It was kind of a light meal for dinner, but we were planning on sharing a Pazookie for dessert, and neither of us wanted to order a heavy meal that wouldn't leave room for dessert! The food came out relatively quickly, and I must admit, though I was initially a bit disappointed by the looks of my plate, I changed my mind as I started in on it. I mean, come on - the plate is 550 calories, so it's not going to have food dripping off the edges. There were three small salmon medallions, a small scoop of couscous and steamed veggies, and a red sauce poured over it all. It smelled divine, but looked sad. But once I started eating, I realized it wasn't sad at all. There was enough food to satiate, and the flavors were surprisingly good. Though, I will say that though I could smell the cumin in the spices, I couldn't really taste it on the fish or in the sauce. I think it just got lost with all the other flavors. My husband loved his shrimp tacos. I guess it's his ""go-to"" dish...though I question having a ""go-to"" dish at a restaurant we rarely frequent. At any rate, we did end up ordering a Pazookie: the Holiday version, and boy howdy was it delicious! The flavors of the peppermint ice cream worked really well with the rich chocolate of the Pazookie batter. It wasn't too over-powering, and one dessert was perfect to share. I will say that I was surprised by the service. Benjamin was very friendly and patient, and knowledgeable about the menu. I know he must have been busy that night, but he never made me feel rushed (I couldn't decide on a dinner entree for while!), or crazy for asking questions or the things that I ordered. That goes a long way with a person like me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa?start=140

Our waiter was great this time around. He checked in regularly and was very friendly throughout our stay. However, the food took a long time to get to our table. 20 minutes for appetizers and over 30 minutes after we ordered for the main course. This all would have been ok, since the restaurant seemed pretty busy that day, except for the fact that the kitchen completely forgot to make a salmon plate that someone from our party ordered. Poor guy had to wait until everyone was almost done to get his food (another 15 minutes). The waiter apologized and the manager came over and told us he would take it off the bill. Everything was handled well.  I ordered the Cajun Pasta with shrimp and it surprisingly tasted better than it did with chicken (how I had it last time I was here). The reason for 3 stars is because each time we come here the wait for food is too long for a casual outing.

La Mesa's BJ's is located within the busy Grossmont Plaza. The parking lot is huge but parking can be hard to find at lunch hours as there are so many stores in this center. Ordering to go is a snap with their online system. I've dined in as well as ordered online for togo. The restaurant is big with multiple seating options so large parties can celebrate here. Service is prompt and efficient. The staff has always been friendly and welcoming. The menu is huge with many options to satisfy various cravings. Healthy eaters will be delighted by the enlightened menu with entrees scaled down in calories. Portion size for those entrees are run a little smaller on average. On this recent lunch trip, I ordered a bison burger meal that came with a side of my choice. I had the bison meat cooked medium rare and opted for grilled asparagus. The burger was delicious. The bison patty was cooked a bit over medium rare though. I enjoyed it but would have liked it more if it was right at medium rare or a bit under. The portion size was filling and could have passed for dinner as well. The price for this meal was very good at 11.50.

Blair C.,"San Diego, CA",151,61,130,4.0,2/9/2015,"We had dinner there this evening and it was seriously wonderfully delicious. I had the chicken bacon ranch pizza which is always to die for. My boyfriend had the New York steak with cheddar mash potatoes and clam chowder. He wasn't very stoked with the mash potatoes or the soup. He said they were both very basic and bland, with the potatoes being a little on the cold side. But he thoroughly enjoyed the steak saying it was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious. We also got the Santa Fe spring rolls which were good but not the most amazing ones we've ever had. Cheesecake Factory does them much better. These were fairly basic, small with a good taste but nothing to die for. But the main reason I always come to BJ's is for their amazing deep dish pizza which is always the best and their amazing selection of craft beers. Their seasonal double IPA on tap right now is pretty superb. Besides all the food one of my favorite parts of the experience was the service. Our waiter was so friendly and attentive! He was constantly there when we needed him and even when we didn't. He knew all the beers very well and was able to recommend a few beers to both my boyfriend and I based on what kind of beers we normally drink and let us taste them to choose. And my favorite part, the pizookie!!! Delicious and perfect no matter what BJ's you go to:) I loved it!!!

Corie M.,"East Windsor, NJ",0,8,7,3.0,3/6/2016,"Went in for a quick drink. Ordered a double so I could have 1 great drink instead of 2 mediocre drinks. The drink was 7.25 and I was charged 8.50 for an extra shot. If I knew it cost more to make it a double I would have just had 2 separate drinks. I asked the bartender about it, she was very pleasant and had it changed to the price of 2 regular drinks. But again I would have liked to try a different flavor drink if I knew it was going to be the same price. The price was not on the menu and I guess I should have asked about the price but I didn't want to be that cheap ass / I'm a bartender and from my experience it has been cheaper to get a double than order 2 drinks. Maybe if you don't offer a double price you should tell the customer when they order.

Last go-round the food was delivered but the food runner  took off before we could ask him to bring the silverware, likewise appetizers served without appetizer plate.

Paula C.,"Santee, CA",0,5,,1.0,6/21/2015,"TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE.  Last night, my family and I got take-out BBQ chicken salads and a pizookie which both were very unsatisfactory. The salads consisted of old lettuce, corn, and a few pieces of dry chicken which is 3 of the 8 things the salad was supposed to have on it. The pizookie was very hard and looked like it had been sitting for a few hours.  We then returned to BJs for a refund or remake of our food and were treated horribly by the young girl at the take-out counter. It then took about 10 minutes for the manager, Ryan, to come out to remedy the situation. Ryan was very rude and did not apologize for our experience. We decided to get a refund after he said it would take 20 minutes to prepare two salads and a pizookie. He did not seem willing to refund us, but after an ""I guess we can do that"", he took about 10 minutes to find our order on the computer and give us our money back. We tried giving our unappealing food back to the young girl at the take-out counter, but she replied while looking down and chewing her gum, ""nope, you can keep it"".  Overall, BJ's service has greatly declined and I can say without hesitation that they have lost our business. Both Ryan and the girl in takeout were very rude and were not apologetic in the least.

I had their Ahi Tuna Salad and I have to say that it was actually alright! Granted, it took more than 20 minutes for it to come out, but definitely still good. Restaurant salads can tend to have too much dressing but it turned out to be light and surprisingly delicious instead. I also had their famous Pizookie, a warm gooey cookie topped with ice cream. Doesn't matter where you go, a dessert like this will always hit the spot :).  In terms of service, I don't know if it was just that night but it was incredibly sloooooow. We only ordered salads & pizza but we were there for 2 hours, spending most of it waiting for everything. Food took awhile, bill took awhile. You get the picture. To give credit where it's due though, our waitress was incredibly nice. When my friends didn't like their salad (mysteriously their Caesar salad didn't taste like Caesar...) she made sure to get them a different salad of their choice (free of charge) AND had the chef in the kitchen make a whole new batch. Professional, right? Best of all, she didn't make a fuss or give us a hard time about it. I was going to give BJ's only 2 stars because of the slow service but our server was so professional I had to bump it up to 3!

We were told to wait 10 min so we found a table in the bar.  Took about 15 minutes, which didn't bother us since it was a busy Saturday night. After seating us, I  immediately asked to move as we were seated next to two swinging doors that the employees use to enter & exit the from the dining room to the kitchen. After moving, we got two cold beers & ordered dinner. However, the waitress couldn't multi task or  organize herself to handle more than one table at a time after she got a few more tables. At this point, we barely saw her. Someone else served our dinner which came out quickly & tasted good!!!! After the dinners were brought out, my husband immediately signaled for the waitress since his beer glass was empty.  The waitress kept rushing by empty handed but kept putting her finger up saying she needed a minute. We did finally flag her down & corner her but she never brought the 2nd beer my husband ordered due to the fact that she said the keg was getting changed. By then, my husband's meal was long gone. Interesting enough, the busboy never picked up our empty plates. He walked by often enough but only seemed focused on clearing & setting empty tables. Our dishes stayed until the end of the meal when the bill arrived. The waitress came over & said she felt bad & offered to take off my husband's first beer, which never happened. We paid the check up at the hostess stand as we were tired of waiting for her & spoke to the manager. Just thought he'd want to know....NOT THE CASE. He apologized  robotically & stared at us. I was so embarrassed by his lack of warmth or concern for our lousy service. Hey, I just thought he'd want to know.

Margaret D.,"San Diego, CA",823,730,90,1.0,7/3/2012,"My group arrived around 5:30 with plans to see a movie at 8:20 at the theater. We had already purchased tickets, so we just needed to walk over. Three hours is plenty of time for dinner, right? It was my mother's group Mom's Night Out and everyone was looking forward to relaxing and eating before the movie. The hostess said we weren't getting seated until 6 because the patio server did not arrive until 6. I got a drink in the bar. When I went to settle my tab, paying for my single drink took about 10 minutes because I couldn't nab the waiter. It was not overly busy-- a Monday night with many empty tables at 5:45. He rang it up for a non-happy hour price, which he caught and corrected immediately.   The hostess then allowed us to sit out on the patio a few minutes early with drinks from the bar.  When the waiter arrived, a couple of women asked toward the beginning for separate checks, waiter said he would do that. There were 2-3 additional servers helping out, so they were not short of staff. People had trouble getting drink orders early on. A friend who arrived later went out of the bar and bought her drink-- she is a waitress and said she hates it when people do that, but felt it was quicker. Waiter asked if anyone wanted apps. We said we were ready to order dinner and did so. Three people got apps, one to eat as the main course. The women indicated they wanted the apps at the same time as the main course. They set out app plates for everyone and brought the apps out before the main. My friend ordered a sirloin, medium-rare. It was well-done. Like, very well done. She waited for someone to appear so she could tell them, but no one did, so another friend went out and grabbed someone. There was a group of servers just inside the door who were not doing anything, though not assigned to our table. The waiter brought her another steak, also well-done. She brought this to their attention again. Finally the manager came out and said the waiter had written down ""medium well"" instead of ""medium rare"" and they had just figured it out. By the time they brought Steak 3, she was full on potatoes and green beans. Another annoying bit: when they gave her a new plate, they did not clear the old. So I stacked them up for her after I was done with my plate.  I got the ""Maui pork chop."" It was supposed to have a spicy glaze but it was dry and hard on the outside with no flavor. My roasted red potatoes were soggy and some of them cold. I did not point this out because it seemed like it would completely overwhelm the staff . The lady across from me got the Hawaii Mahi over rice, and she was salting it heavily and pouring lemon on it because it was bland.  After the disappointing entree, I wanted to order dessert, but nobody ever came by for the order. The lady beside me ordered dessert, grabbing the waiter as he went by. No one else got a dessert order in. 25 minutes later, she had no dessert and asked where it was. He said it was coming and brought it out 30 seconds later.  At about 745 we asked for the check, figuring that 15-20 minutes was plenty of time to pay. It was not. The guy had not separated the checks and went around asking what everyone had had and writing it down. So by 810, we still did not have the checks. Once I got mine, I went out front and got the manager to ring it up. He said the problem was that we asked for separate checks. ""When you ask for separate checks, it takes longer for our system to process it,"" he said. Really? It takes your system almost 3 hours to process it, because that was asked for at the beginning. Also, if they do not want to do separate the checks, that is fine; the restaurant can just say they don't want to. It is unacceptable to agree to it and then not want to do it. And the waiter and manager did know we needed to leave before the checks came. And separate checks have nothing to do with service. I did not argue because all I wanted to do was go see the movie. Anyway, it was a big hot mess. We got movie seats, but down in the way way  front.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa?start=360

Oh yeah, the food:   The Santa Fe salad with Cajun shrimp is my favorite.  Tons of fresh vegetables with crunchy tortilla strips.  I usually ask that they use a little less spice on the shrimp.  Otherwise, it feels like my ears are on fire.  The clam chowder is superb.  I recently ordered from their lunch specials.  Tried the 1/2 black and bleu flatbread pizza paired with spring greens.  Was worried the pizza might be too rich, but it had the perfect amount of bleu cheese and steak.  All for $5.95!

For starters it took 10 minutes  after we were seated for anyone to acknowledge us. Once we were finally greeted we were already ready to order. 44 minutes after they took our order our food came. My fries were missing. My gf pizza was cold like it was sitting out for a solid 20 minutes. The server knew somewhere along the line a worker messed up firing our order and he messed up not putting my fries on the order so he told a manager to come talk to us. So I'm thinking, here comes the time to save us as customers and split the bill with us (which was only $34) and he goes ""I heard your pizza was cold and it took a really long time to get your food. So I'm going to take the pizza off the bill. You have a good night"" and walked off. Awesome. Not. Ended up paying $27 for a cold 6"" pizza a grilled cheese sandwich and a broccoli soup and two sodas. That will teach me to stray off from my regular restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa?start=360

Sean L.,"San Diego, CA",230,302,536,4.0,6/25/2010,"I'm not from Chicago, but I have been there and I've had deep dish.  I have to say, BJ's is one of the closest I've come to finding similar deep dish here on the west coast. Mom and I stopped in a few days ago for lunch, debating between here and Panera.  BJ's made our choice easy for a few reasons- Panera is WAY overpriced for a sandwich shop.  At BJ's, you can sit and have a server take care of you.  Panera makes you stand in line and your food comes out on a plastic plate and surprisingly, for the same amount (or more) than BJ's weekday lunch will cost you!  I ordered the personal 1-topping pie with a wedge salad, which from 11am-3pm Mon-Fri costs a whopping $6.25!  Definitely made the right choice.  BJ's does something magical to the wedge, and it's all in their dressing.  It's a sweeter variation of a blue cheese, along with bacon, onions and tomatoes, the wedge is a winner every time.  And my pizza: thick, buttery, hot, cheesy and crispy, just like I like my women... Not in the mood for pizza?  Fine, BJ's also offers salads, sandwiches, burgers, ribs, fish, pasta... and if that's not enough, how about one of their giant baked potatoes?  Top it with chili, alfredo, cheese, broccoli, blackened chicken.... the possibilities are endless. You may have also noticed ""Brewhouse"" in their title.  Yes, that means they brew their own beer, and do a damn good job of it.  Porters, wheat, red, blonde- if you can think of it, they probably brew it! During happy hour, your visit gets even sweeter.  Half priced apps & mini-pizzas, as well as discounted cocktails and beer!  A little too late because it's not on the menu anymore, but the blackened chicken pizza came with a special surprise.  On your happy hour bill, it would read ""Black Chix Special"" (which may have something to do with why it's no longer on the menu).  I would order it just for enjoyment of sharing the bill with my friends and even the servers who never paid attention to it before. Oh and like I even need to tell you about the Pizookie.  If you live near a BJ's and have never had one, WTF is wrong with you?  And shame on your friends for hiding this from you.  Freshly baked cookie (chocolate chip, white chocolate, peanut butter, or oreo) topped with vanilla ice cream right out of the oven!  Can't decide?  Go half and half, OR get their giant 3-cookie Pizookie to provide fun for your whole table, or a stroke for one person. BJ's has it all, and their food is a step above most brewhouses, which try to direct our focus to their beer in an attempt to slip sub-par food down our throats without us noticing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa?start=380

I've been to the BJ's in Chula Vista so I knew what to expect.  Hands down, this location is much bigger than the one in Chula Vista. I didn't get a chance to visit the bar, but, just by looking at it, it looks bigger and better than CV's. I was feeling the vibe on a Friday night.  Our party was outside on the patio. I think we had about twenty or so people for the birthday dinner.  My girlfriend and I ordered a small BJ's Favorite pizza which included oven-baked meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, black olives, white onions and seasoned tomatoes. The pizza is perfect for one really hungry person or for two people. The pizza was REALLY good. My girlfriend and I both enjoyed every bite of it. And, for dessert, we ordered their new pizookie trio. We had to choose three out of the five. So, we ordered a chocolate chunk, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut and Cookies 'N Cream. Whooooooooooooo! They were all amazingly deliciously good! Our favorite was the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut. Oh man! Seriously, its so warm in your mouth with a soft chewy cookie and to balance it out, vanilla ice cream.  Customer service was good. The waitress did a good job for being a busy Friday night and, especially with a twenty+ party to attend to.  I wouldn't go out of my way to drive out here just for this BJ's, but if an event or special occasion came up, I wouldn't hesitate to come here again.

They have a variety of things to choose from to be able to accommodate different people with different tastes and preferences.  I particularly like this location. It is larger and roomy. The only thing about this place is the parking. It is in the Grossmont Shopping center so parking is difficult. People are trying to park for the shopping center, the movie theaters, and different stores and restaurants around there. But it is worth it.  Their pizza is amazing. I LOVE their giant baked potatoes. You can customize them to your liking and it is enough to fill you up as a meal (that is, of course, if you dont mind eating a whole plate of CARBS for lunch/dinner) :) I especially liked their Parmesan Chicken!  But im sure no one will let you leave without having the BEST dessert to end your meal. PIZOOKI- large warm cookie of your choice, freshly baked topped with a large scoop of vanilla ice cream! The great thing that i love about this is that you get to have a variety of cookie flavors to choose from! AND on top of that, you can ask to get 1/2 and 1/2.

The bottom line is that they have a great selection of beers and tasty pizzas. The atlantic salmon filet (blackened) with lemon chardonnay butter sauce, rice pilaf and steamed vegetables is also surprisingly good and the pizookie (a large, hot, melt-in-your-mouth delicious cookie topped with a scoop of ice cream) is a must have.  The La Mesa location is filled with families and is far from being a hot spot.

Janelle M.,"San Diego, CA",143,97,42,1.0,12/20/2011,"I have been a long-time fan of BJ's.  The pizza, the pizzooki, the salads... all incredible.  So when it  came time to plan our company Christmas party, I thought of them.  This location has a big covered patio attached to it where private parties are usually seated...perfect.  So I sent my bosses over there for lunch to try the food and to get a feel for the place.  The manager was very nice and accomodating.  He said we could have the patio for our party which was to take place on a Monday night.  We planned to do it buffet style with pizza, pasta, and salad.   I called back a couple days later to give them our food selections and they had no record of our reservation... (Red Flag #1).  So we re-reserved and submitted our order.   On the day of the event, I called to check that we were still on and that everything was okay.  They assured us our party of 20 on the patio was reserved and we were set. When we got to the restaurant, the patio was packed with a different party.  (LAME.)  The put us in 3 tables lined against a wall in a tight space.  Not buffet style.  The food was supposed to be out and ready when we got there.  It took about 15 minutes for our pizzas to show.  And each table got one of the 4 pizzas we ordered.  So even though there was a big variety of pizzas and pastas and salad, none of us got to try anything but what was set in front of us...  bummer. The food was good.  But it was supposed to be unlimited everything.  Mind you for the buffet group price, you pay about $18.  The pizzas were eaten and not replaced with new ones even though we asked.  It was disappointing.  I know they were busy.  But we didn't have a dedicated server.  We definitely won't bring a large group back here again. The Pro's:  - Good food - Clean restroom The Con's: - Unprofessional management (lost reservation, seating area given away...) - No server - Service was REALLY lacking - Charged hefty price per head for service they did not provide and that was not bottomless/refillable, as advertised.

Two out of three seriously lacked.  The first time was ok. Just ok. Nothing to complain about, but no bragging rights. The second time, I ordered deep dish and got the wrong pan type pizza, and it sucked.  I complained and was given a courtesy card, with $20 on it.  I used that card tonight and received a deep dish pizza, as ordered.  It was, however, doughy, tough, and not cut all the way through. Not a good time. And this will be the last time I order take out from this location.

Laura T.,"San Diego, CA",138,188,120,3.0,4/24/2014,"Sit on the heated patio, it's delightful! I love BJ's! I love that they serve Mt. Dew, I love that they have ooey gooey pizookies, I love the potato soup and the chicken alfredo baked potatoes, however, I do not love the poor service we received on the night of March 28th. We brought our friend here for her birthday. She is here from Inner Mongolia learning English, and likes to try new places. We brought her here because she wanted pizza, but we knew the menu has lots of options in case she changed her mind. I told the hostess it was this young lady's 17th birthday and she said she'd ""be sure to tell our server"". We sat for a short while before our server came up and introduced himself. He took our drink order and offered us appetizers, and as he left the table we noticed the table next to us who had been sitting since before we had, and they got his attention. They told him they had not yet been helped, to which he responded, ""I don't know who your server is, but I can help you"". To me that was a good attitude, not looking to place blame somewhere and not trying to pass the buck, but seeing an opportunity to make another tip and hopefully salvage this couple's experience. We received our drinks and ordered some appetizers and dinner. He checked on us once while we were eating the appetizers, but we didn't see him again until he brought us the bill. A nice young lady brought us our pizzas and unfortunately, our young birthday friend likes ketchup for her pizza, which we didn't know when ordering or we would have asked for it when we ordered. Anyhow, not one single person came to check on us while we were eating so she ended up eating half of her pizza but was displeased. My drink had been empty since our dinner was delivered and I was hoping for at least one refill. Our server offered us to go boxes and dessert, but we declined, because by that point there was no salvaging the night for any of us. Needless to say, the hostess did not tell the server we had a birthday girl, the server did not make sure our meal was tasty and complete, and BJ's moved from the top of our ""Let's go there for dinner tonight!"" list, to about mid-way down. The parking can be a real bear, especially on a Friday night, the wait can be long, unless the heated patio has availability, and the trouble is not really worth it when I'm paying to have dinner service but being ignored.  We are not the only ones who left disappointed that night, as the couple who was sitting next to us and had no server for a while would also attest. I'm going to go out on a limb and guess the not so strong service staff works the patio in anticipation that not many people will want to sit out there. Maybe not, but that's certainly the way it felt that night. BJ's is normally quite tasty, and the service is normally pretty good, both reasons why this review got 3 stars instead of the 2 it actually deserved.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa?start=400

Everything we've had at BJ's has been really good to fantastic and we've tried quite a few items on the menu, pizza, pizzuki, flat bread pizza, salads, pork chops, pot roast, lighter fair and so on. The best time to go if you want pizza is happy hour in the bar area as mini pizza's are 50% off! SO great! Their home made root beer and orange soda's are awesome and I never get any other sodas there because of it. If you're going during regular dinner hours with a large group be prepared to wait a bit. If you're going with a smaller group at that hour try looking for seats in the bar. It's not always hard to find seats right away in their and you can eat from the full menu.

MariGrace B.,"San Diego, CA",61,23,,2.0,4/15/2012,"Very disappointed in my visit to this location of BJ's.  As a chain it is one of my favorite places to eat.  With a menu that can satisfy almost any craving and deserts that are scrumptious, and custom drinks that are killer, what more could one ask for.   How about some decent service?  It started as early as when I was being seated.  I was being seated at a table for 2 - one of the small booths.  There was a section of 4 of them empty, 3 ready to go with silver wear and everything and one that had nothing on it yet and was soaking wet.  The hostess takes me to the wet table.  I mentioned that it was extremely wet and she just said, well yes they just cleared it.  I did not sit and with a sigh she said would you rather sit here.  I cordially said yes.   At first the server seemed pleasant and decent, but then it seemed things were taking a really long time.  He had to be asked for refills of the non-alcoholic beverages and this wasn't only at our table.  The one next to us was out of water and he stopped by both tables and never bothered to fill any water or bring more pop without being expressly stopped and asked.   Also he completely missed one of the items we ordered, and never brought the lemon for my water.   Then there is the quality of the food.  I have never had an issue with BJ's before.  It has always been great.  The avocado egg rolls were as they normally are - yummy.  But then came my Fresh Mozzarella and Tomato salad.  The balsamic on the plate was crusted and dry - seeming as though the salad had been out for a long time.  Also there was a lot of some thin liquid all over the plate - I believe it may have been tomato juice, but not positive.  Next came the pizza, a mini cheese and tomato.  Normally this is my absolute favorite item,  This time it came with one clump of tomatoes directly in the center of the pizza, and not a lot of cheese.  I had to spread the tomatoes out myself, and their texture seemed a little off.  My friend said her salad was good. Then we ordered desert, which took forever to get out of the kitchen, but the runner who brought it was very pleasant and was joking with us.  We had a few bites, but were pretty well stuffed so for the most part we left it.   Overall this is probably my worst experience at a BJ's.  Had I not been to other locations previously I would be inclined to never eat any of them again.  I certainly will not return to this location.  Very disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa?start=440

Luckey D.,"La Mesa, CA",2,58,15,2.0,5/1/2012,"Hubby and I went with my Aunt and her 3 grandkids as a thank you for doing some work for her.  We got there a few minutes after them and they had already been seated.  We asked the hostesses if a woman had come in with twins and a girl and they had no idea but let us walk around and find them (we found them in the second booth from the hostess stand). The family had already ordered the quesadilla appetizer and it was good.  Hubby and I ordered the small size Sweet Pig deep dish to share.  My Aunt ordered the mini vegetable pizza but was brought the small deep dish vegetable pizza because they ran out of dough for the mini (at 5 pm? you can't just pinch dough from the larger size to make a smaller amount?).  But they only charged her the mini size price so that was fair. The kids ordered from the kids menu--ribs with fries and extra fries, Mac & Cheese (which I swear was just blue box Kraft) and chicken tenders. My aunt didn't want the kids to have dessert but offered to pay for my husband and I to have one.  We tried to explain this to the waiter but he didn't grasp the concept of adding it to the bill but serving it after they left. So, about our server...I wish I could tell you his name but they don't wear nametags--he had a faux hawk and light brown hair.  They also don't write down orders.  While it's impressive to remember larger orders I find it unnecessary in a casual place like BJ's and actually just more annoying for the servers to have to remember all that stuff.  Our server got our orders right but presented my aunt with the wrong, $20 higher, bill.  He corrected it and said ""I think you'll like this total much better"" but he forgot to include the dessert we wanted and my aunt ended up giving us $5 cash. I asked the server for a menu to pick our Pizookie and it took forever to get a menu.  Then we saw the calorie count on the Pizookie (1,000-ish calories depending on flavor) and said forget it!  We took our $5 to See's and got a few pieces of candy to last a few days instead of having to ingest and extra 500 calories each at one sitting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa?start=440

When I spoke to Ryan (who is probably the most amazing manager I have ever met) he was very generous and open to work with my budget. He actually outdid himself! The food was fantastic the patio was ready for me when I got there and they even helped me set and clean up the mess we made. Family and friends loved the food and the service. It was such a great experience that I would definitely recommend this place for any private party.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa?start=480

Dalyn C.,"San Diego, CA",38,55,9,4.0,1/5/2013,It was my first time ever coming to Bj's and the serivce we got was really good. I ordered the thai mango chicken salad which was delish! my husband ordered the jambalaya. It took so long to get our order because i guess they ran out of rizoto for the jambalaya so the manager came and asked us if we wanted to continue to wait or if we wanted to subsitute it for something else so we decided for pasta jambalaya. My husband was a bit disapointed because he wanted to try it with rizoto. But it wasn't bad with pasta. The part that really impressed us was the manager removed the jambalaya from our bill. He didn't have to do that but he did. Because of the wonderful customer service we will be coming back here again soon.

Henry T.,"San Diego, CA",126,516,36,4.0,11/14/2010,"Gotta say that I think the best way to enjoy a place like BJ's is to go on happy hour on a Saturday night. As Khann and I did last night. We were seated quickly in an area off to the right of the entrance and a lot of the menu was very cheap. $2 off appetizers, which we ordered in the form of two plates of chicken wings and a plate of Santa Fe spring rolls. The wings were good, not oversauced or spicy, and the spring rolls were like open-faced, Mexican-flavored egg rolls. There was very little taste from the guacamole dipping sauce provided but that wasn't too bad. I was in a pizza mood from two days ago, so we ordered two mini-pizzas, both of which were half off during happy hour. The ""BJ's Favorite"" pizza was okay, a little more cheesy than I expected and had olives, which I didn't like, but the crust was firm and the size of the pizza was manageable. I ordered the meat special pizza, which we weren't able to finish but is now leftovers sitting in my fridge for later. Since it was happy hour, I figured it was only right to order a beer so I went with the darker beer. It was tasty enough, but I could only finish half of the beer. I admit that I'm a weak beer drinker, certainly not the drinker Khann is. I had to switch to Pepsi, which was also very tasty. I'm a big fan of Pepsi so it probably would've been better if I just stuck with Pepsi throughout the night. We were debating getting dessert and I admit that I wanted to try the Triple Chocolate Chunk pizookie, but we were both stuffed by that point so that was a no go. $46 for all that food? Not bad. The bar area, I liked very much because there were hi-def TVs all around the area tuned to various college football games. The table we chose was a little small for the amount of food we ordered but the seats were comfortable. I had issues with the small men's bathroom here. One stall and one urinal? I had to save going to the restroom for later because the guy in the stall was taking longer than I expected.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa?start=480

Caryn C.,"La Porte, IN",50,1,,3.0,1/18/2015,"Our first visit to the La Mesa BJ's 1/17. We had a party of about 25, which we made reservations in advance for. Members of our party did not arrive all at once so some of us had ordered drinks while we waited. We decided we wanted to get some apps so we let one of our servers know and said that we would have separate checks. She informed me that because she had entered drinks that she couldn't separate anything. As someone who served for several years I knew that that was untrue. (If this is how BJs systems operate then some upgrades are severely needed!) She also told me that I did not indicate multiple checks when I made the reservation. I let her know that I was not asked our preference. In the end, we ended up writing our checks out individually ourselves and she divided them up on the computer. It took her an hour of our time to do so. I think the manner in which she handled this was very unprofessional. I was pretty disappointed with our service here especially because it was a special occasion. I also think that the area for large parties is understaffed. We were one of three large groups and there were only two servers taking care of everyone.

Sarah C.,"San Diego, CA",47,81,11,1.0,8/4/2013,"Ok so I have been here twice. It was recommended by a co-worker of mine. 1st time was ok nothing special. Food wasn't even that good. But the second time I went last night was what did me in.  My bf and I brought our friends along with us. his homeboy my homegirl. We decided to treat them out for the night. So we were seated down at a table very fast which was nice because it was packed. Had a great waitress to begin with until she went on break and we got a new one. Her name was and yes I WILL  name her in the review Carolyn. She was not as friendly or nice or sweet as the waitress we had when we first got there and ordered our appitizers with. I felt a not so good vibe off of her. I had asked to change my order in a good enough amount of time they said even after I told them it's not a problem if you can't or it's to late. First waitress said it's totally fine and she would make sure they changed it. Well the waitress CAROLYN had a major additude about it and for the rest of our night. We finally ordered desert and it just happened to be my boyfriends bf so he got a free one well Carolyn brought it right out and then left and then came back 10 mins later to tell me they didn't have the Binet I craved for about a half hour. 10 MINS LATER after bringing my man his!!!!! I jokingly said to my bf that she was making it up bc I changed my order and I could tell she wasn't happy about it even tho it didn't affect her in the slightest. She wasn't around when I said it so I know she didn't hear me bc no1 else at the table did either. so we were there probablly for a few couple of hours laughing talking enjoying our dinner. then she brought us our check and then we looked at it she left right as I was trying to tell her we needed 2 checks because one was paying cash and the other card. So she comes back 20 mins later we then explained that we needed two but we understand that it wasn't her fault because the first server didn't tell her that. Then she comes back 20 more mins later to give us the checks 2 seprate ones leaves the table comes back and takes my card for mine and my friends and my bf's $100 bill for his check for him and his friends dinner.  So I just happened to look at the suggested Gratuity b4 she put them into seperate checks which was 12 comething. We got our change back and my card i signed and my bf left her a 13 dollar cash tip for both of our checks. ONLY to find out this morning on my account was BOTH charges!!!!! So not only did she pocket the 48 dollars. But my card was charged twice and I was never told about this.  I called the manager this morning very upset and after having me on hold for 20 mins while he looked it up saying his system went down(Trick they use to get people to calm down) he apologized and said he takes full respoinibility for her F up! I told him why are you taking the responsibility she fed everything up. He then told me well she probablly just did everything on 1 card as 1 bill I told him NO bc then I wouldn't have 2 charges and then he told me the charge was reversed right away.SO THEN WHY THE HELL DIDN'T SHE TELL ME SHE MADE A MISTAKE SHE WAS GONE FOR LONGER THEN 10 MINS WITH MY CARD!!! i also told him well thats not true bc my card doesn't reflect that, I still have 48 dollars missing out of my account!!!!!! Then he asked was it a debit card I said yes but so what he then proceeded to tell me well the bank must be holding it and they will deicde when you get it back. He did say this should have never happened and then reiterrated that he takes full responisibility which made me even more mad! WHY THE HELL isn't CAROLYN BEING HELD ACCOUNTIBABLE!!! An why isn't anything being done for my troubles!!! That means I have to do all this work for something that wasn't my fault! They have until Tuesday to give me my money back shoot I might even go back there 2mrow night and raise hell bc everyone I have talked to says that my order should have been comp'd for all of this trouble and I know it should have been I WORK IN HOSPITALITY!

ashley b.,"San Diego, CA",375,3,,1.0,7/8/2013,"I seriously HATE THIS PLACE. The ""chef"" is a complete douche bag. Hate to resort to name calling but there really is no better way to explain him. I have given this place several chances and every time is worst than the last. The experiences that stick out the most are as follows.  1- a few friends and I went out for dinner out food was ok at best but what made this time stick out was the fact that my vegetarian friend asked for the veggie burger and got a regular Burger, then she sent it back, after sending it back she got a cold veggie burger with an unmelted slice of cheese, we asked to speak to a manger and that's when the ""chef"" came over and just kinda rolled his eyes. And had then sent it back. My friend had been her quit a few times like me trying to give it a chance and she has worst story's. so she told him that this was not the first time she had something like this happen that's why he told her well if you keep getting BAD service don't come back. The kicker, she got her burger after the second send back and all they did was throw another piece of cheese on it. Wtf 2- my same friend actually was dumb enough to have her fiancé's birthday here. Well needless to say after telling us they didn't have room for us indoors they would manage something outdoors but we had to wait..... Ummmmm she had set reservations in advance. Don't act like you didn't know we were coming. Well we had a few guest that had to feel like outsiders because they had to sit at a completly separate table away from the group. Then after putting us outdoor on a cold day they said they would turn the heat on. Gee thanks. Well when we ordered our food  and the people who were isolated ended up never getting their food when we asked about it the waitress said she forgot to order it.... So I was very upset about this I asked to speak to the manager again and again he was a douche. And after lots of arguing with this guy he gave them there dinner HALF off. Seriously none if them even ate their food because we were all done by then and actually still sitting and waiting for their food to arrive so they just had it packe to go.  3- the straw that broke the camels back. So my family and I went in one day and we have an elderly grandmother (97) who is very picky about her food. Well all she asked was to not have mushrooms in her dinner. They server said he would take care of that. But when our food returned there were mushrooms. We asked about it and he said rolling his eyes well the chef said he is not rooming them so she is gonna have to herself. I was so shocked seeing how I was in the food industry and ya I have felt with my fair share of egotistical chefs and have been given this line before... They don't are about your tip... But guess what I cared about my tips and my clients being happy so I would take all the mushrooms out myself. Needless to say I'm sure that chef was the same dough bag as before.  So you ask why I have been so many time?!? Ok the food ok when it's made right or you get it. And I honestly thought I would for once have a decent dinner here.... Nope.  Also I think the servers are all just overwhelmed, they are understaffed and not trained well. And that chef is the worst. I'm sure that he is hell to work for and this is probably why all the servers look so overwhelmed and undertrained because they don't care to learn bc try hate their boss. I hate this place and even worst HATE THIS CHEF. sorry guy your not that cute and you work at Bjs no need to have such a big head.  Your not down town or anything or at Mr.A's so don't act like it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa?start=420

Savannah S.,"El Cajon, CA",0,2,1,1.0,1/8/2015,"Had the absolute worst experience here last Wednesday night. Mind you, a friend and I came in around 10 on a Wednesday night which is usually pretty late but we had just gotten off of work and were hungry. We got greeted by a host right away and asked if we were wanting to sit in the dining area or the bar area since it was happy hour. We decided to sit in the bar area with probably one or two other tables. Before sitting down I walked to the restroom and noticed there was hardly anyone in the dining area as well. After about 10 minutes of waiting we were introduced to our server (really wish I would have remembered his name) and he took our drink orders. Our drinks arrived promptly and although we were ready to order, he rushed away quickly and was not to be seen for another 15 minutes. When he finally arrived back he asked if we were ready and we ordered. My friend and I both ordered a side wedge salad (with a side of balsamic vinegarette and asked if we could have the salad chopped in the back, which they usually do without a problem) , nachos which were on the happy hour menu, and a medium pizza with pesto, sundried tomatoes, garlic and basil. About another 15 minutes went by and another waiter dropped off our salads. They were not chopped and we didn't receive any balsamic vinegeratte as well. It took about 10 more minutes to find someone (not our waiter who was nowhere to be seen) and asked if we could have a side of dressing and some silverware. He brought them quickly and we began eating the salads. Five more minutes passed by and the same guy dropped off our nachos. They were NOT appetizing at all, it was mostly more of a bean dip and after two or three bites we both gave up and decided to just wait for the pizza. Another 15 minutes later... our pizza arrived and we noticed that instead of basil and sundried tomatoes, they instead put pepperoncinis and artichoke hearts. Luckily, being as hungry as we both were we ignored the fact and dug in. The pizza was probably the highlight of that dinner because it all went downhill from there...  After noticing we were finished, the waiter came back and asked if we were finished and if we wanted to place a dessert. Wanting to get out of there as soon as possible we simply asked for the check. ANOTHER 10 minutes goes by and he drops it off to our table. It came out to be 30 something dollars and I put down a $100 dollar bill. A few minutes later he comes by and says he would be right back with some change. He then drops off the change and tells us to have a good night. By this time, my friend just nodded her head in annoyance to the extremely poor service we had just recieved.. and as I'm counting my money back to myself I realized the change he gave me was short 7 dollars. I could not find the server again for the next 10 minutes so I asked the busboy if he could get him for me. The waiter then comes and says word for word ""okay guys what did I f*** up on now"". By this moment I should have asked to speak to a manager but I was so annoyed and in a rush to leave I just explained to him that he gave me the wrong amount of change back and that he owed me 7 dollars. He then began to tell me that I was wrong and to check it again. He went back and forth from the computer checking the math and then realized that he had ""accidently"" added something to our ticket that was meant for another table. He apologized and said ""so what I owe you like another 5 dollars"". I am in such disbelief that any establishment would allow their employees to be giving this type of service, which seems to be a regular thing as I have read most of the other reviews on here. I myself am a server at a restaurant, and have been for the last 7 years and have never seen anything like this nor would I give any customers a reason to leave me anything less of a 5 star review on yelp.

Fredd S.,"Chula Vista, CA",120,71,15,3.0,9/1/2011,"The deceiving name conjures up images of sexual acts, so if you're looking for something along ""those"" lines look somewhere else. Well the waitresses are very cute, so if you're good at that I guess you could give it a shot, if you're not and you actually want to get some food read on. This Bj's is like any other BJ's out there but if I left it at that, this wouldn't be a good review, and if you've never been to BJ's you wouldn't really know anything new. So, I came to this particular BJ's and the hostess was really friendly told me about being so excited to get out (she'd been working for six days in a row) and how she planned to get sauced afterwards lol. The waitress was super awesome and had the food out fairly quickly I ordered the mozzarella and tomato salad and the grilled salmon. The salad was amazing, and the salmon decent, but it felt kind of dry and they white sauce it had on it was super bland as well as the vegetables which were not only bland, but also waaaaaay over cooked. I've had the pizzas, which are pretty decent when you have them with a beer, which their beer selection, although nowhere near magical, is actually nothing to look down at. Next time I come, I'll make sure to order some bar style food like a burger, pizza, wings or even pasta. Stay away from ""complex"" dishes like salmon, which they can't really handle, and make sure to try a beer. You won't regret it. Staff super friendly.

jennifer j.,"Santee, CA",4,20,2,2.0,4/17/2011,"So... here's the thing I have loved BJ's since it opened here at Grossmont Center.  I love their beers, their Berry Cider (enjoyed the Linde-Berry), their apps, and Pizookies.  BUT I can't tolerate the poor service anymore. Tonight we got there and were seated by 6:15pm - we didn't have to wait for a table.  Part of our food didn't get to our table until 7:34pm - we had to ask for the rest of it, and the salad came out wrong.   I'm trying to figure out what part of our order was the hardest - or did our waitress not put our order in for a half hour+ after she took it? Here's our order: 2 root beers 2 kid's milk 1 Calamari 2 kid's mac & cheese with applesauce 1 small Mediterranean pizza 1 wedge salad (minus onions w/ranch instead of blue cheese) 1 small bowl of chili I give it two stars for the delicious food.  No stars for service.  We sat there for an hour after ordering with our two kiddos who are very well mannered, but were incredibly hungry and restless after sitting for so long.  We literally tapped our diaper bag for snacks to feed our youngest during the wait.  Our kiddos ate some of the mac & cheese before going to the applesauce... only we had to sit and wait for another 10 minutes for our waitress to pass by our table so we could ask for spoons.  Our waitress never apologized for the wait... and even asked if we saved room for dessert as we were standing from the table in an effort to get our check.  I would've LOVED to have shared a pizookie with the fam... but how long before we would've seen it?  We didn't get our check until after 8pm. This is a place we have enjoyed going to... but the service has taken a sharp decline in recent years.  Our experience tonight wasn't isolated.  We've come here less and less frequently due to the poor service not only with the fam, but also with friends.   Tonight we left so disappointed.  I can not imagine that we will be going back to BJ's in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa?start=460

Other items I love on this menu are any and all of their flat bread pizzas, the avocado spring rolls and their Ahi Poke appetizer, YUMMY.

For appetizers I think they have the best spinach artichoke dip in San diego, the avocado egg rolls are good, or if you're with a few people try the sampler platter. A lot of their chicken and steak entree's are kinda dry and flavorless. Their bazookies are amazing! BJ's signature beer are mostly all good, and they have a large variety for everybody.

My buddy I hadn't seen since high school wanted to reunite and I was left with the decision to choose a place. So at this point I'm like WOOHOO...no price limit cuz you left it up to me to choose a place. Looked through a bunch of great restaurants and most were in downtown and hillcrest...sigh...On a Saturday night....I wasn't even going to bother.  Not only am I challenged in the art of parallel parking but there is also the little problem of parking being non existent in these areas.  Plan 2 comes into action. I'd been dying to go to BJ's Restaurant ever since I found Casa De Pice (next door) after it moved from Old Town (yeah, long time ago) Point is...yeah, parking is still scarce at the Grossmont mall but it's nowhere as horrid as it is in downtown/hillcrest.  Ok...fine story time over and on to the real stuff about the restaurant. We went Saturday at 2pm and were seated right away. That was pretty cool...I'm sure the night gets really crowded so I'm glad we didn't want to that.  It's horrible of me that we got seated so quickly that I can't describe anything about what the restaurant looks like...I really zoned out...plus I was busy catching up so had no time to focus on my surrounding (good thing there wasn't a crime and asked to give a description of the events that took place) Anywho, our waitress was super nice and un-intrusive (that's probably not a word) but we got enough attention to where nothing was missing. On to the food, we shared an appetizer sampler. Basic restaurant foods, cheese sticks, taco thingers and what i really wanted to try, the artichoke dip. All of it was good and filling. Nothing particularly stood out to me but it was all definitely good.  We made the mistake of ordering more after the huge appetizer. I got the ""gourmet mac and cheese."" It was really good. At first it looked small but you find out the hard way that it's the right size. I ended up taking half of that home. Everyone raves about the pizzokie and we didn't get to try it, but I'll be back. I want to try the chicken bbq pizza since everyone I asked about the restaurant recommended it. The menu is huge!!!!

Second time, I had the veggie burger on sourdough bread with the thin shoe string fries. Beware, there burgers are very big and come with a ton of fries. I'm not complaining at all, it just a lot of food and I had to take half home.  Both visits were wonderful service wise and the restaurant (and bathrooms) were clean. The beer selection is mostly their own since they are a brewery too. The Wheat Beer was my favorite.  Definitely plan on going back many times to try some more goodies.

Second, my klutzy brother-in-law slipped and dropped a slice of his pizza right after it arrived from the kitchen.  When a waitress saw it, she immediately stopped and helped him pick it up, and even offered to bring him a mini pizza to replace his slice - on the house!  The manager also dropped in to check on us, and made sure we knew the mini pizza was on the house.   Now, keep in mind that we didn't even ask for a free slice or mini pizza.  We would have been content to just laugh at my brother-in-law and that would have been the end of it.

Over 40 people, you figure they wouldn't double book the patio, especially when the 2 totally clash. A bday for a fifty something yr old lady and all her crazy family and friends with a 1 yr olds family bday party! Those people sucked and were no fun, it was like Dungeons & Dragons couple had a baby and invited all of their Lair to come out and celebrate with their white trash family. Ugh... They were in no mood for us , and well myself and cousin were in no mood for them.  The Spread they served up for our party was awesome! 8 different deep dished pizza's, I don't recall which kinds, but a good variety. I'm not a big fan of there pizza, its far to greasy oily greasy for me and the tomato's they put on are just giant chunks of gross can'ness, mainly its all the oil they use.Im still on a mission for a great deep dish pie in SD. Makes me miss Chicago big time! I heart their Cesar salad, its great , fresh , Parmesan cheese is rad and the croutons are homemade there, so that's a plus. I think they also had a Alfredo pasta, nothing to special about that either. No real flavor unless you added salt and or pepper to it. So I opted for salad and beers galore!  Berry Burst cider I think you are wonderful! They gave me their version of a snake bite, it was with there Berry Burst Cider and there Nut-brown Ale, it was OK. Not a true snake bite, but it was good. I just settled on the cider itself after while. Oh they also have they best savory to die for yummy delicious beer from Belgium. LIndmen Framboise - its divines! Like drink a glass of strawberry's, its sweet a dessert beer , you could pour it on ice cream and be stoked! Drank one of those to finish off the evening.  The staff was very helpful and accommodating to our large party, the bartender was super personable and attentive. They have 2 happy hours a day . The first during normal happy hr time, and then a second after 10pm. Prices aren't bad and staff is awesome.

Michael R.,"Louisville, KY",242,217,55,4.0,11/5/2007,"I've only been to BJ's twice. On my first visit. I was not impressed. It was crowded and loud, and the food was mediocre. In my head, I lumped it into the Chile's/TGIF/Red Robin category. I only went back because my roommate said they had cheap lunch specials. They DO have good lunch specials, and it's not even remotely busy during the week at lunch. I like that. Still, based on the food alone, I'm not inclined to praise this place. I give four stars for the service I received. To go with my half Turkey Cobb Sandwich and salad I ordered something called a Jerryburst (don't remember the exact name), which is some sort of berry cider or something mixed with beer. It sounded interesting, so I thought I'd try it. A few minutes later, our server came back to let me know that they were actually all out of the Jerryburst. She recommended Wyder's Pear or Peach cider. I like the pear a lot, so I requested that. A few minutes later, she returned, saying that unfortunately, they were out of that too. She asked if I'd like to try the peach, and added that she'd be giving us a free Pizookie for the inconvenience. Well, I hadn't tried the peach, but I was more than willing, and who can argue when free dessert is involved! Also, their Pizookie is probably the best thing they have to offer. All their food seems pretty standard, but a huge cookie with ice cream on top? I'm in! Our receipt came with a customer survey, and you can be damn sure I went on-line and told BJ's corporate all about what a great experience I'd had there. Hopefully, the praise for our server trickled down and she was acknowledged for her positive attitude and great customer service skills. One last thing to note: Ladies, when you visit, be sure to use the bathroom and check out the art. It's not just some lame print you can buy at Ikea, or whatever usually ends up in public toilets.

Al J.,"San Diego, CA",40,55,16,3.0,3/23/2010,"BJ's has a great atmosphere, but for some reason the food choices or lack there of, really disappointed me. I'm not a picky eater, but the menu was confusing to me. Nothing stood out, I even asked my friends for recommendations on what to get and they were just as indecisive. I found myself looking through the menu for 45 minutes before I even made a decision on the Jambalaya. And even then I wasn't to sure I wanted that, I guess I just settled since all of my friends had already ordered.  As for as the food is concerned, the Jambalaya was mediocre, a bit salty and way to much paprika! I sampled some of my friends entrees, and they were just ""OK"" as well. Nothing that my taste buds went crazy for. BJ's brews there own beers, which are pretty good. I had a pint of the Red and also the Blonde. I'd recommend the Blonde if you like the lighter beers like myself.  I would have probably gave this place only 2 stars based on my food experience, but our waitress was really helpful and friendly. We were celebrating a friends birthday, so it was rather a large group, about 12 people. She was prompt and made sure we had everything we needed. Customer service is everything to me, It elevates the experience regardless of the product or service you're purchasing. I'm a true believer in that.  I'm still up in the air about BJ's.

Dr. J.,"Spring Valley, CA",3,19,27,1.0,9/8/2014,We came for the pizookies and was so excited but our server Kayleigh was obviously tired wanted to go home and prematurely dropped the check before we even got our dessert. She came by to check on us after we got our dessert and it would have made more sense for her to drop the check then but instead we felt rushed. She didn't even ask if there was anything else she could get us. Poor service is a reflection of poor management and this isn't the first time I've gotten poor service there. We spoke to the manager and he seemed very new and more bothered that we were even talking to him.  He had no idea what to say. Explains why they were both working late Saturday night. Thank God for their pizookies or I'm not sure they would have any business! I still tipped her bc I'm in the industry and bc I felt sorry for her. I will not return to that location.

Tonight I went with my husband and in laws and our 3 kids (ages 7, 5, 18 months). I know it's Friday night so it's busy and they told me the wait would be about an hour, but they would see if they could call us sooner. I'm fine with that. After we were seated everything went downhill fast. Our waitress took half an hour before she took our order. We ordered an appetizer to hold us over and that took another 20 minutes to get to us, and they never brought us flatware so we couldn't eat it till it was cold, and we asked for small plates and they come out wet and covered in grey goo. Yuck! I asked for a small bowl of fruit to hold over the baby who was getting cranky. She devoured that quick so I asked for some cubed cheese. It came shredded. Not a big deal, that's manageable. Well now it's been 45 minutes and our food still hasn't come out. Food comes and we have to send a plate back for the taste being so awful. We ordered a desert and it came but they only brought 2 spoons for 7 people. Had to ask a bus boy for more spoons bc we couldn't find our waitress (again). Spoons that were brought were wet and covered in grey goo. By the end of everything we talked over how awful it was and realized we were never even offered refills on our drinks!

We sent it back and 20 minutes later after the rest of us had eaten the second attempt at shrimp tacos arrived. They were exactly the same, not cooked and translucent in color. The server called over the manager and she said that was ""how they cook them here!"". I explained that when I cook shrimp at home I usually can tell when they are cooked by the change in color. In the end we walked over the street to Rubios. The shrimp tacos were excellent and a third of the price. This place is good for beers and a snack, but not a meal.

Jennifer M.,"San Diego, CA",83,65,21,2.0,11/9/2012,"To sum it up: Good food, but terrible service for a large group! If you'd like to read more, see below.  I recently had my birthday dinner here. We had reservations for 20 people. I'll never do that again! It was an hour after arriving that we received water and almost 1 hr and 15min  before we received our  drinks (beer, cocktails, sodas, etc).  At this point my guests were already annoyed, but we stayed because we had already ordered our dinner. Upon complaining to the server, we were told ""well, that's what happens when you all wanted to order your food right away (nevermind that he asked, ""would you like to get started ordering?""). And the bartenders are really backed up. I'm sorry but your drinks will be here shortly."" I was in shock that he managed to place blame, rather than just appreciating that we were frustrated. Later after our food arrived, I'd say about 65% of the orders were incorrect. The pizza crusts were switched, pizzas that were not supposed to have cheese came out with cheese, toppings were all switched around. We were so frustrated. By this point, I had to cancel my other plans for the evening because dinner had already taken 2+ hours and we were barely eating. When complaining about the mistakes for the food, the server was defensive (again) and not all that friendly. He blamed us for having ""complicated orders"".  The manager had spoke to me multiple times by now, apologizing profusely and saying he was embarrassed and couldn't believe this had happened. In the end, he took quite a bit off the bill, which we all appreciated, however I did not plan to spend my birthday evening chatting it up with the manager. I would've rather been chatting with my friends and enjoying my birthday dinner. I had to argue with the server (who by this point was pretending we didn't exist and only showing up when we actively flagged him over), that I wanted to eat dessert. About 20 minutes after the check had been paid, I reminded the server that it was my birthday (and that the manager promised me a free pizookie, to ease all the troubles of the evening). The server argued about if I could have the small or large pizookie. Sigh, unbelievable. Finally I got my bday dessert, but by this time over half my party had left.   On another note: the BBQ Chicken pizza on gluten free crust use to be amazing, but for some reason they felt like they needed to mix BBQ sauce and marinara sauce together now, so I wouldn't recommend ordering that.   In BJ's Pizza's defense,  EVERY other time I have gone there the service has been stellar, food delicious and no mistakes.   Go with a small party, don't order anything complicated and make sure you have plenty of time and you'll love this place.

The veggie burger was almost entirely rice and literally had no taste (thank heavens for onion and ketchup, I would say the cheese helped but I wasn't offered it for some reason). The veggie pizza actually tasted like something if you poured a gallon of red pepper flakes on it. I had passed this place many times and thought I'd give it a try and I really regret wasting my money here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa?start=540

I swear this is the whole reason that I go here is just for the Pzookie. I love the white chocolate macadamia nut or the Oatmeal Raisin with vanilla ice cream. I have wanted to try the Oreo one but not sure if my blood sugar could handle it.  Other than Pzookies the waitstaff is awesome. Which is necessary when needing to figure out what to eat and to enjoy what you have ordered. Randomly I like to choose to try other items on the menu and I always look to my server for options.

Had to wait just to sit in the bar, and then waited an hour and a half for my sandwich I had ordered because the server, who must've been new, put the wrong order in. I was irritated because everyone that was with me already ate and I was still waiting for my entree when she didn't even have the decency to let me know what had happened. Meanwhile I just sat and waited- for a very long time. When I got my sandwich is was very cold, and sloppily put together.

This place is crackin from their own handcrafted beer AND root beer to the pizzas, salads, and of course......the PIZOOKIES!!! Remember pizza + cookie = pizookie and my favorite is the white choc. macademian nut....Mmmmmm. Here are some of my fav. entrees at BJs: Appetizer, spin and art dip pure awesomeness. I would gouge my eyes out if I could have a BBQ Chix Chop Salad or the Honey Crisp Chix salad everyday of my life. You can't go wrong with the BBQ ranch dressing the chop salad, and the freshness of the lettuce, tom, and almonds with honey mustard dressing in the Honey Crisp Salad. You can even get lunch size portions too! Sourdough Burger all the way friends, you can't go wrong with sourdough bread, 1000 dressing, lett, tom., paired with crispy thin or wedge cut fries. Def. a fan of the country fried steak, although hearty, but satisfying. And also a fan of the pot roast, one of the best comfort food menu items at this place!! I do have to say that the customer service....is annoying! Now hold on, hold on, I said!!! I don't have problems with their customer service, in fact the service here is on point. What's annoying are the things they have to say when they greet their guests! I don't want to be bombarded with beer options, appetizers suggestions, and asking if we've made our ""selections"" all in the first greeting! These are servers who work hard for their money, not ROBOTS! It's the one thing about corporate restaurants that I do not like. But I get it, some people don't know about anything that is offered at BJs, but MOST people have some inkling of what they would want in a restaurant, so LAY OFF ON YOUR WORKERBEES CORPORATE!

I have never been in a pizza brewery as nice as this.  The decor is impressive.  Very spacious with a huge bar.  The bar has a selection of bottled beer which is second tro none.  Chimay, Chimay Special, Lambics, and the liquor options are broad enough to fill the desires of even the pickiest Yelpers. But even better than the bottled beers are the beers brewed for BJ's which are served via taps.  We had their special IPA, which I HIGHLY recommend.  Also, not being a fan of red beers, theirs is very good and easily the best red I have ever had. For food I got the lunch special personal pizza with caesar salad.  Salad was average.  Pizza was super good with a Chicago style doughy crust which was soft and delicious.  As a fan of thin crust, this was really good. Service was superior.  Our bartender/server, Valerie, was the best I've ever encountered.  The perfect blend of freindliness and professionalism. -1 star because of the corporate atmosphere.  Although I see the purpose of consistency, I prefer my five-star experiences to be slightly rough around the edges.   Regardless of that, I'll be back.  And hopefully Valerie and an ice cold IPA will be there waiting for me!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa?start=580

A C.,"San Diego, CA",67,4,,1.0,9/19/2012,"We had a horrible experience at this restaurant....twice. Unluckily, we got the same waitress both nights. The first night she was not terrible, but not good. Last night, it was so bad that I almost walked out. I do not undertip and I respect waitstaff, because I put myself through college as a waitress. However, this was horrible. Both times, we had some sort of issue, and NEITHER time did we get to talk to a manager about it. The smell in the bar/kitchen area is overwhelming. So much that we couldn't eat anywhere near them. Last night we got sat away from those areas. However, from the second we got there, it took about 10 minutes for a waiter to come take our drink order.  Now, I understand people get in the weeds and need help. So, he was helping our waitress, got our drink orders and brought them to us. Then, from the time we got our drinks to the time we ordered, it was about 20 minutes. And not once did we get a ""i'll be right with you"". Then, 35 minutes later our 1 flatbread pizza and 1 pasta dish.....(seriously) came out. My husband ordered a Jumbalaya dish that was super spicy. We had our waitress walk by about 3 times before she offered a drink refill (and it was out). So, he stopped eating because he needed a drink. Then she grabbed his glass, took another tables order, put that in, came back with a check for another table, gave them to go boxes, grabbed more to go boxes and boxed up their pizza for them, then went and got their check, grabbed the other tables credit card/check...ALL WHILE HOLDING HIS GLASS. So, 10 minutes later, his food was cold and he still didn't have a drink. Needless to say, our appetites were ruined, and the entire experience was awful.  The food was not horrible, but my order was incorrect, and for the sake of time, I didn't send it back. It was mediocre at best though. Overall, if you want a busy, lackluster experience, here's your place. If not, stay away. There are like 10 other BJ's in San Diego.

They took the salad back and so I waited to eat my pizza. I asked if they would want to take the pizza back and place it under the heat lamps to keep it warm but they insisted that it would be fine.

Frank C.,"Jackson, OH",6,17,,4.0,3/30/2012,"Since living in La Mesa, I've frequented the Bj's brewery somewhere close to 15 times. Out of those times I've only actually waited to be seated 4, with wait times varying from 5-30 minutes. So, I can't add much input on how quick you are to get seated. I usually just drift over I the open seating bar area. Never have i had trouble finding a seat there with a party size of 2-4.  The customer service is spectacular. Maybe it's because I'm so good looking ;-) but, I always get greeted and treated like I'm at Hooters! The bartenders and waiters/waitresses are second to none. Smiles from the time I sit down until the time I sneak out after leaving my cell number on the receipt along with a MUAH! And a generous tip. =) Any place with a menu that is 10 pages long, with 5 of those pages consisting of just mixed drinks(which are amazing and a wide variety), wines, and craft(A++) domestic, and imported beers, is always a winner in my book! I've yet to have a bad meal here. This would be 5 stars if the jambalaya would have been more spicy. I enjoyed it but, if a guy from the great state of Ohio says it needs more spice, then it needs more spice!

Now on the other hand we were still able to drink more so we had a taste of the porter and IPA. The IPA was awesome, but the porter was terrible. So, we both had a ""pint"" of the IPa. I have been to many breweries/pubs etc. and I can tell you right now their ""own"" beer glasses are NOT 16oz. On the menu they are advertising a pint, so we asked our waiter to bring us a ""real"" pint glass (almost the size of their water glasses) but he said that our glass was a pint and the water glasses were 18 oz. The beers they brew are in a diiferent glass than their ""guest"" beers which we saw and again definitely not 16 oz. I say they are 12 oz at best!

What's cool about this place is that they have almost EVERYTHING, from sandwichs, to burgers to pastas to even tacos!  FOOD: I got the Chardonnay Shrimp Pasta and there was a good ratio of everything from pasta to shrimp to tomato's. Also, came with two bread sticks. And the portion size was HUGE, let's just say it was enough to take home and eat again later on. From the looks of everything they aren't skimpy on the portions..you really do get what you pay for.  SERVICE: It was good, our server was very helpful in everything, came to check up on us at the right times and asked if were okay AFTER she saw we didn't have food in our mouths. She asked if we wanted re-fills and didn't automatically just try to grab for our cups. A+ on that!

But, when compared to other local spots to grab a beer and a bite, or order a pizza, BJ's is about as exciting as The View, and just as interesting. I've been here a few times, ranging from a few years ago to quite recently. My friends love the pizookie, but I don't have much of a sweet tooth. I've had some pretty blech food here in the past, so when they convince me to go I usually get a flight of beer and pace myself while they gorge on unremarkableness.  The only thing that saves this from a two-star rating is that the prices don't seem exorbitant and the service has been consistently good.  I'd say it's a great place to go just to grab some conversation while filling your caloric needs, but it gets too loud for that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa?start=620
Chardá F.,"El Cajon, CA",259,261,53,4.0,11/30/2010,"Good place to stop for lunch while doing some shopping as Target, Macy's &  Walmart are just a skip, hop and jump away.  Not to mention how the hospital is conveniently just across the street so if you are one to go watch a football game and have a deep dish pizza and decide to get insanely wasted while you're at it and catch a bad case of alcohol poisoning you will be taken care of because the ambulance is literally across the street. On a serious note, friendly service and laid back atmosphere (we did go on a weeknight so this could be diff on the weekend) the bill came to $35 total so about average in prices. It was freezing cold in general inside and out so we changed our mind from eating in to ordering to go. We got 2 burgers, 2 fries, kids meal, and an oreo cookie pizookie. This was certainly not my first time here but I hadn't been in a few years and didn't know they had the oreo cookie pizookie now, I've had all the others so decided to try this one with the hubby. It was awesome, like a milk and cookies party in my mouth! I loved the oreo mousse that it comes with that is the icing on the cake that sets it apart from the other pizookie's. For me, I'm not a burger girl but I felt daring so I tried the grilled burger melt and it was delish...a tad hint of sweet (probably because of the carmelized onions and special sauce) but still savory with the two cheeses. For the hubby, California burger substituted a turkey patty instead of beef for less calories, he said it was very juicy and flavorful. I prefer the wedge cut fries as they are well seasoned and very filling compared to those wimpy shoestring fries. Portions were decent and the food was pleasing. Don't forget to sign up on their website to get a free pizookie on your birthday every year!

Bradley B.,"San Diego, CA",2,14,3,5.0,11/23/2011,"5 Stars. I've been here multiple times recently and every time has been a pleasure. The menu is extensive without making you feel like it's too much, as a 21 year old I've made the choice not to have alcohol in my life(straight-edge for anyone reading this who might know what that is) but I can also appreciate it's alcohol selection which is basically the first half of the menu. From, salad to pizza, from pasta to steak there is everything in between for almost anyone you bring to enjoy. I even came here a little while ago and one of our apps, (avocado rolls) were taking a good bit of time to come out, so they were asked about, and within 1 minute our server had either a supervisor or manager at our table who apologized and comped the app for us. THATS quality! They recognized that something either happened or it was simply just taking too long and took responsibility for it. I wish a lot of restaurants could learn from this one little(HUGE) detail. Prices are just right and it's always moving here, plently of seating to choose from, plenty of parking and you can bring 3 or 4 friends in and not have to worry about being under-dressed or a little too loud, it has just the right amount of class to just say, ""Hey let's go get some good food really quick."" The servers have always been great and polite making sure you're being taken care of. If you're in the area of La Mesa or Grossmont and need to hit the mall or are thinking about dinner and a movie? Drop by BJ's grab some food or a tummy filler before a movie and then walk across the parking lot to the movies.

The choices on the luch menu were good, and the prices fair.  I ordered a ''Don Julio"" Margarita, and was met with a frown and 'oh really' from the server.  I inqired about her reaction, she replied ""I don't like it, it has coke in it"",  I looked at the menu description, and said 'oh really, it doesn't say that here, it says it has ginger ale in it"".  She replied back ""yeah something like coke"".  I changed to a Pomergranite Margarita. Ordered the BBQ Chicken Choped salad, my partner ordered the Grand Soup and Salade, Ceasar, and Chili for the soup. My partner's Ice tea hit the table within seconds, and in just a short time, our food was on the table.  The BBQ Salade was outstanding.  I found my self scarfing it down, really tasty,.  My partner commented that the chili was really good, lots of flavor, and just enough spice to liven it up, but not enough to overpower the tase. I was about 1/2 through my dish when my partner commented, within earshot of the passing server, ""didn't you order a margarita?"".  The server spun arround and said ""oh yeah I forgott that"", and darted off. I was 3/4 through my meal when it finally hit the table. So here's the nutshell; Good food, great location for lunch (if you come a little off peak time), weak service, really loud inside.

Venus L.,"San Diego, CA",43,83,2,2.0,9/10/2009,"This review is based on my two trips to BJ's: one back in May and the other a few days ago (and will explain why my friends and I will probably never go back there). The first time here was back in May for a friend's going-away party.  We had a group of about 20 come into the restaurant.  The servers were  really nice and efficient to our large group.  Overall, it was a good dining experience; everyone had a good time and the food was also amazing with the pizookie to end the evening. Fast forward to four months later.  A small group of us (eight in total with some who were also there at the first visit) decided to take on BJ's special which was Dinner for Two for only $19.99 (includes an appetizer, a pizza and a pizookie).  So we all meet up at the restaurant where we were told it would be about a half-hour wait... which then turned into 45 minutes.  I started to get a little concerned as I saw parties close to our size getting seated right away while we were still waiting.  One of our guys decided to speak to the front and we were finally seated. So we get a table out on the patio which was not crowded at all (wonder why they just didn't seat us there in the first place) and start ordering.  The first thing we order were appetizers which I thought seemed like it was taking forever just for those to arrive.  We started to notice that people who were seated after us had already ordered and were getting their food before us.  Does it really take more than 20 minutes to make a salad? A while later, appetizers finally come (after being brought to the wrong table - twice).  What really bugged me was that not everyone got theirs at the same time.  Only half of them came out and were already eaten by the time the other half's orders arrived.  A few minutes later, pizzas start coming out with almost all of them except for one (which took another 10 minutes to get to our table). When it came to paying the bill, there were still some mistakes.  We all got split checks; however an item my friend ordered was on another check and not his.  After that, two of the guys decided to speak to the manager about our dining experience.  I'm not too clear on the details but it seemed that the manager had feared that an experience that we had would happen due to some new staff and such.  They apologized and we left.   Had I written this review based on that night alone, it would only receive one star.  However, the food was good (on both occasions) so it's getting two stars.  Still, any restaurant with poor service is one that I'll probably never go to again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa?start=620

I came back and ate in this time and was surprised to find that pizza was only a part of the menu. They also serve pasta, burgers and a whole myriad of other items.  You WILL find something you like on their extensive menu. I was also pleasantly surprised with the various demographics of the customers.  There were families, couples, and groups of thirty-somethings.  BJ's has great general appeal and I think that says a lot about their food. They have microbrews that are made on site, I believe.  I enjoyed my beer.

While I've never had a bad night there at BJ's, the service hasn't always been the greatest. It's a very decent place for smaller groups. I've had large parties here before and it doesn't work out so well. Usually, you split the party up, or wait a long time for them to make you a proper table--mind you, this is WITH a reservation.  If I ever go to BJ's, it's usually just for appetizers and drinks. The food isn't bomb enough for me to take a date there..

Nikki S.,"La Jolla, CA",0,5,,1.0,7/9/2011,"I usually go to the one in La Jolla, even though it is smaller and I will continue to do so after my visit to this La Mesa location. To start off, the waitress was wearing an bracelet that stated, ""I love boobies"". Really? I am trying to eat, not think about boobs. There are other ways to support breast cancer research. Anyway, I was with my mom, we were seated promptly and the waitress got our drink orders, (2 iced teas). When she brought me my drink, the straw had a sticky substance all over the tip. Lip gloss! I was totally disgusted. Either they are reusing straws, or she gave me someone else's refill. Gross. The menu was changed and they no longer have the pecan salad, which is what my mom wanted. Oh well. I ordered a soup and sandwich (yum) and mom did too, but hers also came with fries, which she didn't want. She asked for a healthy alternative, like fruit and we were told that they only serve fruit on the weekends. Huh? Our waitress says she will try to get them to do fruit, but will give veggies if they don't have any. 5 minutes later, my mom's soup arrives. Not my soup, not our sandwiches, just her soup. She set is aside and we waited another 10 minutes. Finally they bring out the rest of our food, no fruit, no veggies. My mom asked the guy who brought the food where they were and he said he could bring out veggies. He brought a steaming pile of cauliflower with a few broccoli. The were no refills of our drinks, no checking in from the waitress, until she brought our bill. The service was horrible. 1 star rating because: -dirty straw: gross -lack of service: waitress unprofessional and MIA -Poor timing of food brought out: was I supposed to sit there and watch my mom eat? -no fruit on weekdays: that is super lame.

Alexis W.,"Oceanside, San Diego, CA",0,17,1,2.0,1/26/2013,"So, my fiancée and I came here 3 or 4 times with no complaints. Then we came on New Year's Eve. Long story short, the waiter spilled a whole drink on my lap, our wings came boneless when we ordered regular, and then the pizza we ordered with no onions came loaded with them. We brought all of this to our waiters attention, he said he would get the manager. He came back shortly after and gave us the bill...with everything on it and never spoke to the manager for us. So I took it upon myself to go find him, he was very friendly and made it right by us, which was great. So two weekends later we decided to go back because we love it there. I got a daiquiri, and it was disgusting, so sour I couldn't even drink it. I went up to the bar to ask for a different one and I told the bartender what was wrong. He made me a new one, I watched him dump the sour mix in it, and it was worse than the first one, so I just said thank you and gave up on that. We ordered BBQ wings, and we were brought buffalo wings. We ordered a cheeseburger pizza with no onions. It came out with no pickles, but lots of onions. But much different from our previous visit, our waitress was fantastic and fixed our order by bringing us the correct wings and pizza. Our pizookies were almost raw both times too.

E W.,"New York, NY",9,58,,3.0,8/1/2007,"Since we didn't want to wait 15 minutes to be seated, we chose to sit outside on their patio.  The ability to just go sit down in either the bar or patio area was a nice option which we appreciated. The patio is right off the bar and the music in the bar was BLARING.  Thankfully the patio has doors so you don't have to listen to the noise the whole time.  However, whenever someone walked in or out of the patio, the music and noise were pretty deafening.  That was a bit of a mood killer. My husband had the bbq chicken salad which was huge and he said it was very good.  He was totally pleased with his dinner.  I got the salmon entree.  I ordered it blackened and it was a bit too much.  They overpowered the fish with seasoning so I couldn't actually taste the fish.  And there was so much seasoning/dry rub on the fish that it became a crunchy, extremely salty layer.  I could only make it through maybe half of my fish and then I was done.  It was so bad that I declined the to-go box to take it home. To sum up:  our server was nice, we were able to sit down at a table right away, and my husband loved his salad.  The music coming in from the bar was overwhelming and intrusive and my salmon was pretty bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa?start=680

Food- Tasty,delicious and they give you huge portions!  My fav appetizer are the avacado eggrolls.  Recently I tried the thai shrimp lettuce wraps.  They were so good but a little hard to eat because the shrimp falls out of the lettuce. 2. Drinks-as far as mixed drinks they have a ton of different types-huge selection. 3.Desserts-Wide variety but the Pizookie is the best! 4.A ton of seating so usually the wait isn't too bad unless it's fri or sat night. 5.A patio room seperate from the main dining area to have group parties or events. 6. The bar area which has quite a few tables if you want to just have a quick drink and some food with your friends. 7.They are open late.  Do you ever find yourself at 10:00 at night wanting some good food and nothing is open or everyone is closing?  Well not BJ's.  They have late hours which is good for just getting some dessert and a drink late at night or good for a late night craving. The cons:   1.The service can be a little sketchy.  Sometimes it''s good.  Most the time it's ok.  But it hasn't been bad enough to stop me from going there. Most the time it's only so so because they are so busy.  I've worked at a restaurant and I understand how things can so easily get messed up during the dinner rush. 2.The beer.  Their own beers are not good as far as I'm concerned.  The Jeremiah red is decent.  The others just are gross to me and I love beer.  I mean I appreciate beer, no coors,bud or miller anything for me.  3.The atmosphere.  You don't go here to have a one on one talk with your sweetie or your friend or anybody for that matter.  It's loud and sometimes hard to hold a conversation when It gets really busy. 4.  The weekends here are horrendous.  I would so recommend going during the week.  Apparently this is the only restaurant in San Diego on Fri and Sat nights.  Not that it's necessarily the restaurants fault, but you should know that you will often drive by BJ's on the weekend and see the sad faces of those sitting,standing,slumping or crouching people waiting outside to find a table.  If there are that many people outside, there are most definitely a ton inside waiting also.  Just a warning if you have never been before. Overall I will continue to come and enjoy Bj's.  Great food and great desserts.

Maureen J.,"La Mesa, CA",11,44,2,5.0,9/27/2009,"My husband and I just moved into the Grossmont area and were driving around looking for a place to eat. When we passed BJ's and saw ""chicaco style pizza"" on their building, we decided to try it out and were pleasantly surprised! First, the two of us love brew houses. Though my husband was side tracked by the Guinness on tap, I had their hefeweizen. It had a wonderful citrus taste with a light, warm, bready follow up. One of my favorite house brew hef's. Very pleasant. The second time we went in I had their seasonal Oktober Fest brew. It wasn't anything special, but still very tasty. The hubs had their Tatonka stout and was not happy with the results. But after having some of their home brewed root beer, we forgave them for the lack of flavor in those two brews. On our first visit we had their ""two for $20 deal"" which gave us each a soup or salad, medium specialty pizza, and a pizzokie dessert (cookie with ice cream). It was a great deal! We had the vegetarian pizza which was the best I've had here in San Diego. Better then Oggi's by far. The crust was light, soft, and buttery and the veggies were wonderfully cooked. My husband even enjoyed it. Not to mention that their ministrone soup had big chunks of awsomeness in it! For dessert we had the cookies and cream pizzokie. The cookie was sooooooooo warm, gooey, and delicious! It was topped with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, and cookies and cream mousse. Our second visit (to watch the Bears game) I had the egg rolls which were light, crispy, and game with a sweet dipping sauce. I also had one of their well known gormet baked potatos. They are giant! I ate half of their veggie one (which came with alfredo sauce... two thumbs up!) and was pleasantly full. This place is a great stop to wach football at. Though Hooters is fun, we all know that if you wanna get in and eat and enjoy the game, you have to be there about an hour or two before the first game of the day. We would rather not deal with the crowds and the hours of waiting. This is a great alternative. Not to mention this place has the best service I ever had at a resteraunt.

Sarah L.,"San Francisco, CA",61,56,32,2.0,9/10/2013,"Ate here tonight for my birthday, only two of us. Less than I expected. Started off pleasantly. We were seated promptly, then a bright smiling waitress took our drink and appetizer orders. She then informed us she was going on her dinner date and Trevor would be taking over. Seemed a normal thing. We promptly got our root beer and waited eons for my Berry Burst Cider. Another table beyond us, large party arrived after us, had already received all their bar drinks before us. I stopped Trevor as he finished orders at another table and said I think my Cider was forgotten about. He then brought it in a jiffy. I ordered blackened salmon without the sauce due to an allergy. Trevor said he understood and he made the blackened style recommendation too. Food came a reasonable time later. To my dismay, the salmon was covered in the sauce along with the vegetables. *Sigh. Sent it back and the person said she'd tell my waiter. He came and apologized, along with shortly after a gentleman in an olive shirt and tie that didn't identify himself. Waited another ten minutes, food came and was correct this time thankfully. Dress shirt and tie guy came back to check, still didn't know his name or position. By now I was starving and the rest in my party had finished her salad already so I was eating my salmon alone. Desert was correct too. Check came, I honestly expected a discount on my salmon snafu, since I had taken the time to be meticulous about its preparation and my allergy, received confirmation and yet it was still wrong. No discount. I tipped 10%, out of kindness. It didn't meet my expectations and I'm not sure I'll be back, too bad because I'm a local and loooove their berry burst cider. A small discount on my salmon would've completely turned around my opinion, yet that didn't happen.

I looked up the menu in advance, go to order the Chicken Fried Steak and told they do not carry it on the menu in California AFTER Ryans checks on why I saw it online. Doesnt sell. May be because they have way too many menu items and customers could not find it. I Get Chicken Fried Steak across the parking lot at Claim Jumpers and they tell me it is a hot item, go figure. So I Ryan being great as he was  made some recommendations but I opted for an new item, an 8 oz Sirloin not bad price 13.99 I think.

So... moral of the story.. if you ever get dragged to BJs for a B-day or some other random celebration, just get the pizza.  Hopefully they don't screw that up!

Lastly, thier coffee is superb. Great flavor.

HP C.,"San Diego, CA",0,29,,3.0,5/24/2011,"Another spot we visit fairly often. We always sit at the bar - when we can get in. Happy Hour is very popular here, probably due to both the specials and being so close to the mall & movie theater, so it can be difficult to get a seat even midweek. They also added huge additional TV displays, so a big game will bring a crowd as well.  Service at the bar is usually good in that we don't have to wait too long to be acknowledged and a couple staffers even remember what we like. But yes, the obviously forced sales pitches are brutal - there's nothing more obnoxious than having a server recite the menu to me. No, I don't want any avocado egg rolls or spinach and artichoke dip. Stop asking.  Decent food for a chain-style restaurant, with a pretty large menu. They recently added more taps, but their own beer is worth sampling: the Nutty Brewnette is good, and the PM Porter is fantastic.

The reason for this review is to let people know how bad the food is while informing the public that management seems not to even care.

I'm a NY pizza snob, but it was pretty awesome. Had to try the 1/2 peanut butter/1/2 choc chip Pizookie and that was great, too.

We ordered the spinach artichoke dip and appetizer sampler platter.  The spinach artichoke dip was good, it just had hella big pieces of artichoke in it.  The appetizer sampler came with egg rolls, mozzarella sticks and avocado rolls.  The egg rolls and mozzarella sticks were average, but the avocado rolls were soooo good.  So good, we ordered another round of them.  We ate and drank so much, that we were waddling out of the restaurant.  It was actually hard to sit up straight, and I felt like I had rocks in my stomach.  But it was well worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa?start=700

Miguel V.,"Miami, FL",93,436,92,4.0,10/9/2008,"I'll be completely honest, this place only gets the fourth star for the pizookie. You can't beat that thing. I absolutely love all of the different kinds. We usually order the half and half because I am adventurous and my wife sticks to the chocolate chip. Of course, neither of us can finish one by ourselves so we share. As for the food, my wife really loves the chef salad, which is pretty simple and standard, but they do not screw it up, so it is very good. She also loves the loaded baked potatoes with the works! I mean sour cream, bacon, chives, butter, and any other form of cholesterol you can think of.        For me, I really enjoyed the salmon salad, which was very big. Actually, I believe it was the southwestern salad with grilled salmon on it, but it was very, very good on each occasion that I tried it. I believe it includes corn, beans tortilla strips, a smokey, chipotle type sauce, and some very moist and delicious salad. I have also tried the ribs, chicken and some other type of grilled bbq meat combo, which was anything but impressive. It was a little dry and tough, and the bbq sauce had been thrown on post hoc (e.g., not marinated). the ribs were especially difficult to eat and hardly worth the mess. They are also a brewery so try the sampler, figure out which you like and enjoy. I like the darks and the reds too, while the wife prefers the blondes.        All things considered, why do they barely earn four stars? Well, aside from the reasons noted above, they are often crowded, difficult to get seating as they do not do reservations, difficult in large groups because they won't split checks, etc. They can be a real pain about this kinda stuff.

That is fine but i really appreciate when I receive outstanding service.  That was the case this time my server in think her name was Jaclyn (SP?) tall with long dark hair was very informative with with regard to my questions about the menu and which would go best with my beer (Tantonka Stout .)I initially chose to drink.  I was not planning on getting an appetizer but Jaclyn talked me into trying the avocado egg rolls which I was not sure I would like,, wrong they were delicious. She made several  entree suggestions  and of those I picked the grilled pork chops a great match with the stout. The entree was prepared very well other than the veggies being a little over cooked. Jaclyn made sure my beer or water were never empty  and she quickly got me a new knife after I knocked my first one to the ground. FInally although I did not need it I was sold that I had to try the Red Velvet Pazookie, hot moist  and tasty.

Anyhow he never showed up to apologize or to speak to me and as were leaving the restaurant i see her speaking to the manager and i knew he was the manager cause i went to approach him and he stormed into the kitchen!!!! WOW talk about being unprofessional i asked the waited whats all that about your manager doesnt care about customer service?

The food is always alright, not the best but not the crapiest.  However, I look their pizookie.  Heaven on earth. A few years back, service sucked bad.  I used to need to hail down 3 different servers before I could get ketchup.  don't believe me...first time was the waiter, I asked for ketchup, he never came back.  I hailled a guy who was walking by.  he told me ""i'll go get your server"".  for ketchup?  That's messed up.  My server still didn't come back.  This was after 10minutes...so I hailed down another server.  And HE told me the exact same thing.  I still don't see my server coming back with ketchup.  so I got fed up.  I got up and stopped another worker and told him to pass me the ketchup that I saw was stocked behind the counter.  besides looking at me a little weirdly, he did as I asked.  after 15mins I finally got my ketchup and able to eat.  That was the last time I was there for a 1 1/2 years.  Of course, on my drive there (1 1/2 years later) I was telling my friends about the crappy service but the good pizookie (whole reason why I even wanted to go there).  We only about 15mins to get drinks, and after that service picked up.  triple time better than a year ago.  Seeing how I enjoyed their service again, I decided to keep on coming back.  Good choice on my behalf.  The last time I went there, I got a free pizza.  And the time before that, I got a freel meal. however, those stories will be told after my ratings. 1 star for service.  awesome service these days, I recommend going back there just for it. 1 star for food...I usually give 2 stars if it's good...but 1 and it's just for the freaking cookie. 1 star for atmosphere.  Very large and roomy.  I have a lot of breathing room except when the couple next to us decides to makeout the whole time during dinner. price is a little on the expensive side.  but it's bearable.  their jack is 12 a pop...for a double shot and it wasn't a double shot. now back to my stories..for those who wants to hear. my free pizza was simple.  The server had messed it up and got us another one.  But before we had to wait another 15 after our 20mins wait he gave us a free dessert.  Awesome.  Had lots of left over that night. My free meal was unbelievable.  my friend and I were just ordering 3 appetizers, 1 entree, and 1 dessert.  we wanted to take some home that night.  Somehow the waitress messed up and gave us some birthday special which was a free meal, minus the pizookie that my friend had order at the last minute to take home for her boyfriend.  Of course, we did not take advantage of her, we left about $60.  Our meal was going to be $60 anyways and I was not going to pay less just because it was free, if I knew I was going to spend that amount, I will.  What she did with the money is up to her, but it frees my conscious of ripping people off (even though they make a lot of money).  Overall...my last few encounters at BJ has been interesting.  Who knows what will happen next! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa?start=740

The food is pretty good, the pizza is fantastic. If you come for happy hour, you can get a mini pizza for $3.

Twenty minutes after getting our drinks we still had not been served our appetizers, soup or salad. We noticed people getting served before use despite arriving after we had been seated. We left without eating when someone brought us food (appetizers) that we didn't order. We don't think our server put in our order correctly or was competent. She had brought us wrong condiments for our appetizers (ketchup and mustard does not go with potstickers). It shouldn't take 25 minutes to make a caesar side salad and ladle up a bowl of chowder.
