Todd G.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",0,18,6,1.0,8/18/2017,"Called three times to get setup for my daughters birthday. All three times we were told to ""just call ahead"" when we were on our way. We called ahead (40 minutes before arriving.) When we finally arrive with five 13 & 14 year olds -- they have no tables and tell us it will be at least an hour. This place could care less about customer service. The rely on location alone for business. STAY AWAY!!! Update: Below is the response from Alice F at BJs ""BJ's doesn't take reservations because the location is so small; the best we have is call-ahead, and even then, we can't hold tables for longer than 30 minutes.  Even that doesn't guarantee you a table, it just guarantees that you jump to the top of the waitlist.  The place isn't built for large parties, so it's pretty much luck of the draw with parties of over 7 members.  It's not our fault that you're stupid.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-beach
Dino M.,"Santa Ana, CA",4,70,40,2.0,7/17/2017,"Based on two different experiences.  The first visit was last year during off season.  No wait and the food was decent. It's very small and can get very loud.  No bar.  Location, location location... Sit by the windows!  Second visit was last weekend with my hubby. We walked in, obviously during tourist season and during the weekend.  So there was a wait - ten minutes not bad at all. We were sat right by the to go bar in a tiny table. It was ok.  Not intimate and very loud. Our server was very dingy. He forgot our drinks, our salads sat ready for 10 mins and then he tried to give our dinner away. It's like we were in the movie 50 first dates.  Food was good, but not as great as BJ's usually is. The managers didn't seem helpful at all. Bus guys were awesome, otherwise our plates would have sat there in the half corner we are on. Females handling food, had their hair down and to the side :( it was so gross. Seems like the food handling procedures could use some serious over hauling!  2 stars for overall experience at both venues.  Never go during tourist season or weekends. Their staff can not handle quality food and service. It's both, not just half ass on both.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-beach
Semaj C.,"Corona, CA",1,3,1,1.0,12/3/2017,This experience was really horrible been waiting for 20 mins not once did anyone come and ask what we wanted to drink or eat. The restaurant was only half full and one of the employees is just walking by.   In order for me to get service I had to speak with the manager (Danny) just to get someone to take my order. When we did get our food we noticed a couple that just came in only waited 7 mins. I don't know if what I said helped or not. I don't think I will be coming back to the.

I was a little disappointed. The server was friendly. If you want to go to Bjs, go to one of the bigger ones. This one is too small and the food tastes different.  There was only ONE bathroom stall and I really had to go.. There was a weird smell in the restaurant as well.

The server was great at first but towards the end started ignoring our table (group of 6) and were practically the last ones left and had to ask someone else for our check. BUT that isn't the part that made this experience terrible. Food was good going down but 30 mins after I was done I had the worst stomach pain. And after 45 mins of what was the worst drive ever, I had food poisoning. And I know it wasn't anything else I had that day bc I hadn't eaten anything 3-4 hours prior. Also another friend of mine got sick. Never going back. Only gave it 2 stars bc of the other nice people who worked there.

Jessica A.,"Redlands, CA",0,7,5,2.0,2/24/2017,"My family went to BJ's this last week and enjoyed the food and atmosphere being right in Laguna. However we were so shocked and disgusted at the lack of sanitary codes here. One of the customers had a dog sitting in a highchair at the table with them. The dog was pushed up close to the table and was able to put his head on the table while the customers were eating. Multiple waitresses and waiters (including our waitress) would stop to pet the dog as they walked by and then would continue serving people. I watched our waitress pet the dog and then walk over and grab our salad and bring it over to our table. I was grossed out. When they left the highchair was not wiped down, but placed to the side for someone else to use.  We ordered a pizza and my sisters got hamburgers. They are gluten free and we were very impressed with the gluten free menu and breakdown of what many dishes contain for ingredients. The pizza was good and my sisters loved the hamburgers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-beach

Jason W.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,40,52,4.0,7/12/2015,"***THIS REVIEW REVIEW'S TWO DIFFERENT NIGHTS!! PLEASE READ ALL OF IT*** Ok, so, we have found, that anything less than 3 dollar signs, in Laguna Beach, pretty much closes down at 9pm. For us, being from Vegas, that's a bid deal. It was a Wednesday night, we had just got done watching the sunset on the beach, and were by now (8:30pm), were quite hungry. Our hotel was on the South end of Laguna and we were hoping to find a place within walking distance. We had Ruby's a little further South, but, meh'.  We got on Yelp* and saw that Wine Gallery was still open. Off we go....to the door. We open the door and it's pouring outside! All of a sudden, it looks like Domino's.  We decide to wait for a little bit to see if the rain lets up and in about 20 minutes it does. Off we go. We get to Wine Gallery at about 9:25. Unfortunately, their kitchen had closed at 9:00. Bummer.  Back to Yelp*.  There is a couple of places close to Wine Cellar, but again, 3 dollar signs. All of a sudden my wife says she saw a BJ's when we came into town. So we look up BJ's, they are open til like 11:30. Disco!! Onto the trolley we jump and off to BJ's we go! By the time we got done looking online for a place to eat, waiting for the trolley, and getting there, we got there at about 10:15ish. We were seated immediately, ad were given a choice of seating. We took a seat by the front window. We like to people watch and don't mind people looking at us eating.  Our server was Jeff. Jeff was, well, freaking awesome! What a great guy. Was very friendly and helpful, wasn't afraid to engage us, and was on top of our order top to bottom! BJ's would have gotten a 3 star (right on par for a franchise eatery), but Jeff alone was worth giving them 4! My wife ordered a create-your-own personal sized deep dish and was very happy with it. I had The Italian Market thin crust pizza. Mine was great! I love pepperoncini's and this was a really great pizza.  For drinks she had a glass of wine and I had the HopStorm IPD. Loved the IPA. I am a traditional IPA guy and really like this one.  Now, fast forward to Thursday night (the next night). We really wanted to watch the sunset on the beach again, but now knew that dinner was going to have to be really early, or we were going to be stuck again. Well, fortunately, we now know that BJ's was open late, so we were in business! Thursday, was 7/2, the day before a 3 day weekend beginning for the 4th of July. We knew that the ""strip"" was going to be WAY busier that it was the night before, so we were ready for it. Many of the reviews on BJ's have griped that they are slow and can't handle the business. That didn't thwart our plans though, like I said, we knew it was going to be crazy and we were ready for it. If BJ's has anything going against it, it's that it is small on the inside. I'd guesstimate they have a seating capacity of about 60. Add that, the fact they are right across from Main Beach, that they are a well known and popular franchise, and that they ""less expensive"" from other options in a tourist locale, and they're screwed when it gets busy.  People who have been on the beach all day, are baked from the sun, dehydrated from drinking alcohol all day on the beach (yeah, yeah, I know, it's illegal to drink on the beach. It's illegal to go 55 in a 45 mph zone, but does that stop anybody from doing it? be real people), and are starving, all seem to gravitate towards the restaurants at the same time. And these people, are usually the ones who have zero patience at this point, and love to take it out on the people who are there to provide a service to them. I think that that is where most of the negative reviews come from on BJ's. If people tried to have a little compassion and patience, life might slow down a little for them, and they could take some time to relax and enjoy their surroundings. Such behavior was needed this night.  As the trolley got closer to Main Beach, the sidewalks got PACKED. The restaurants all looked to have 40 minute waits on them.  We got up to BJ's and knew we'd be waiting for at least 40 minutes. We told the greeter that'd we'd like a 2 person table by the window again, preferably one of the 3 that are stand alone, and that we'd be willing to wait for it.  While we were waiting, we overheard, the manager talking with the greeter, (we were being nosy) and they had gotten slammed earlier, which backed them up to the point there were at now, they had had someone walk off the job just a couple of hours ago, and had had someone call out sick for the mid/closing shift. Basically, the bottom had fallen out for them on the busiest shifts on the eve of a major holiday weekend. With that being said, did our service suffer? Was it slower than the night before? Yes. But was our server any less friendly, even tho he was slammed and a little flustered? No. He even recognized us from the night before (it wasn't Jeff, as he had worked an earlier shift) as he was the grett",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-beach?start=20

That being said they really need to focus on cleanliness. Every mirror and picture on the wall was dirty. If they were near a table they had kids hand prints on them. The overall cleanliness was very poor - build up along floor edges, under tables, bathrooms dirty.

Wast of money! They were very bitter and overcooked. As for the honey Sriracha sauce couldn't taste it becauae of the bitterness of the sprouts.  For lunch had the Avacado, bacon, tomato sandwich. It was ver tasty I really do recommend it.  For dessert was the new Monkey Bread Pizookie. Did not disappoint must try. Service was very friendly and mostly on point.

Yasaman J.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",4611,317,1580,4.0,10/7/2014,"I have never been a fan of big chain restaurants thus BJ's was no exception or that is what I thought!!! My family and I decided to go walk around Laguna Beach on Sunday early evening. We had eaten a very light lunch that day so we decided to have dinner. As we were walking and talking about our options, we decided to go to BJ's. My husband had never been to the restaurant and he is a big fan of pizza so we decided to give it a try. It was around 7 o'clock and we thought that there would be at least 15 mins wait but to our surprise as we walked up to the hostess, she informed us that they have a table ready for us....SWEET!!! I have to admit that the restaurant was busy and it was loud but it is a restaurant and a brewhouse after all. Right? My dad and husband decided to order beers and we started figuring out what pizza we want to order. After couple of minutes of discussion we decided to order a Large (18 inch, 10 slices) Pizza half mediterranean and half Bj's Special. The Mediterranean half had fetta cheese, olives, chicken, sun dried tomatoes and cheese of course. The Bj's Special had pepperoni, sausage, bell peppers, tomatoes and cheese.  When the Pizza came out everything looked sooooo yummy and it was. The pizza was just cooked right and it tasted fresh. At the end of our meal, we ordered the Cookie n cream Pizzooki which was just delicious. Our waiter was so nice and helpful as well.  We had a great experience at this restaurant. Will I ever come back to this location? YEs Ofcourse.  *** The reason that I deducted one star was because the pizza dough tasted a bit salty to me. I am very sensitive about salty food so I am not sure if it was just me or their dough is too salty.

Inside is a little cozy, but we got right in around 9pm. Service was quick at facilitating an insatiable craving for PIZOOKIE. If you haven't tried this, you must! If you need to skip a meal tomorrow or send your fit-bit ticking off the charts, so be it.  Your cookie base can have two flavors, so we split the baby with traditional chocolate chip (they have gluten free also) and the salted caramel cookie. It's topped with vanilla ice cream, some caramel drizzle and other little chocolate pod-like sprinkles. It's divine and diabolical at the same time. Pizookie, a glass of wine for the Mrs, and some 2‰ milk for me was just under $15 before tip. Wow.

Although they were really slow it took forever to get our food, which was mediocre at best. One thing I found odd and especially annoying was that the waiter never gave us any napkins, took forever to return and when we asked he gives us 2 tiny bar napkins. Like really? You don't have normal napkins??   Then the people at the table next to us happened to spill a side of ranch which made a very loud noise everyone could hear. It splattered all over the walls, booth and floor and was a huge mess. Yet every server and person working refused to acknowledge it or Ever clean it up. It sat there a good 30 min or more before we left and it was still sitting there. If you're in the area I definitely Would Not recommend this BJ's.

This BJ's is located in the heart of laguna beach, off laguna avenue. The roads get packed and they're really narrow. Parking is a hassle and costs money. I parked in a lot that cost $2 an hour.  On to the restaurant itself. As stated earlier the food is same as any other BJ's. I got the chicken wings (spicy buffalo) and BJ's favorite small pizza. The chicken wings were not spicy at all. But this was enough for a light lunch for two. We also ended with a mini macadamia pizookie.  The service is what gives this place 2 stars. It was a Friday afternoon, and the restaurant was half full yet our server was slow and a mess. First off we were seated at a table with a big liquid puddle on the table. Which was not wiped off. He put in an order for calamari after we specified chicken wings. He never cleared our small table after we were done with the chicken wings. He took forever to bring pro of even those could see it sitting at the kitchen ledge where they pick up food to bring to the tables.

Karla S.,"Los Alamitos, CA",165,23,7,1.0,3/30/2015,I just finished throwing up one of the most disgusting meals EVER. I went for a broccoli cheddar soup that tasted like straight nacho cheese. Sent that garbage back and went for the clam chowder which I shouldn't have. It tasted better than the nacho cheese soup but not even 15 minutes later after leaving it upset my stomach to the point of barfing! I've never visited a Bj's with such horrible tasting food. Whoever is in charge of preparing the soups needs to taste them before serving it to guest. And check that they're not expired...

After about 10 minutes, I receive my pizza, and my wife receives her soggy sandwich. She ended up with the shoe string fries, and I had no fries. We told the server right then that we were missing my fries, and that my wife's fries were wrong. They brought out one plate of wedge fries, and we literally never saw or heard from a server again until I had to stop one and ask for our check. My beer was gone shortly after my food arrived, along with my wife's soda, and they never offered or brought refills. After requesting the check, a different person came and dropped off the wrong check. We got our correct check and left as fast as we could.  Overall, not impressed.

Our waiter Jacob continually threw our plates and cups on the table, making a considerable noise each time. My friend and I kept eating our food and hoped the service would get better, but it continually got worse. After taking away my plate, he comes back to our table to show us a ""magic trick."" First of all, we were still eating and he was disturbing our meal, and second, he dragged this game on for about five minutes. I became extremely irritated at this point and wanted to leave. We received our check and were ready to head out when a different waiter comes by and tells us that he gave us the wrong check. ARE YOU KIDDING? He claims to have caught us in time and he claimed to have cancelled the wrong check. Well, it turns out that they didn't cancel the wrong check and my bank statement now has two charges on it.

Reese F.,"San Diego, CA",88,66,5,1.0,9/24/2013,"Dear Lord. I shouldn't have ignored the previous reviews. I am a frequent at BJ's, especially the ones in Carlsbad and La Mesa and have always received EXCEPTIONAL service. While we stopped in Laguna, on a Sunday evening, we wanted to go somewhere to watch the game. Although the previous reviews held giant red flag warnings, we went here anyway because BJ's was the only place around showing the game.  First, they tried sitting my party of three at a two person table. Three full grown adults at a two person table? No no no no. No.  Second, the one TV they had there was playing Family Guy. FAMILY GUY during Sunday Night Football. We had to ask three different people to change the channel for us. After a half an hour, they were able to figure out how to change the channel and find the game.  Third, after waiting 30 minutes to order, we finally put our orders in. Randomly, one person got their food ten minutes later, but me and my boyfriend had to wait 45 minutes for our plates. Since we both ordered sandwiches, I really cannot figure out why it took so long!!  Fourth, by the time we got our food, we weren't even hungry anymore due to the lack of service and being filled up on soda. I politely asked our waitress for two sides of ranch. Ten minutes pass and nothing. We could tell she was busy so we flagged down another waiter and asked him for the two sides. He ROLLED HIS EYES. Two minutes later, he slammed the ranch on the table and sarcastically said ""One..."" My boyfriend politely said, ""We need a second one."" The waiter snapped back and said ""I KNOW."" He turned away, grabbed the second little bowl and slid it onto our table saying, sarcastically, ""Two...""  At this point, I LOST it. Before I ripped this guy's head off, I went to the ice cold bathroom. On my way back, I grabbed our waitress and told her we really needed to speak to the manager. I told her it had nothing really to do with her; honestly she was a gem. So, after giving her side of the story to the manager, he came and sat down at our table, listened to our complaints, comped our meal, replaced our entire order and even threw in two pazookies, all to go.  While I believe the manager did EVERYTHING in his power to make us happy, I know for a fact we will never come to this BJ's ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-beach?start=80

We took the kids out to the beach for the day and the first thing that crossed my mind was where I would be eating. I love trying out little hole in the wall cafes that the locals favor.  Unfortunately, this time at least, one of the kids was insistent on going to BJ's because of their mac and cheese.  This particualr BJ's is teeny, with a very limited menu fitting its small size. There was absolutely nothing that grabbed my attention so we just group ordered a great white pizza, nachos, fried artichokes, with mac and cheese and sliders for the kids. The nachos were a big letdown. I'm not sure how that ever happens cause c'mon it's nachos. Pizza was dry and uninteresting. The fried artichokes were, well fried and that were definitely edible. the mac and cheese was probably the better item off our entire order. To sum it up, BJ's isn't bad for a quick mediocre bite, but had I the option, I would've gone to a hundred other places first.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-beach?start=80

Then lunch came around & we wanted to watch the Heat vs. Pacers playoff game. BJs seemed like the logical choice.  We arrived and they had only 3 tables free. We were seated right away in front of the only TV.  By this time I had noticed the Yelp reviews so I decided to pay attention to all facets of the restaurant. We ordered Mahi Mahi tacos and a deep dish pizza & started watching the game.  We got our food 14 minutes and 34 seconds later. I call that fast. We both enjoyed our food and thought it was good. Not the best BJs but still really good. Michael was our server and provided us great service!! The other servers seemed very friendly and professional as well.  We give this place 3.5 stars: 1 star off for the very small location & not the quality sports bar atmosphere we're used to at other BJs. 0.5 stars off for only 1 TV: seriously there's plenty of wall space to add a few more!

My first visit was with friends. We were shopping locally, checking out the scene, and finally stopped here for dinner before heading back to reality. The wait was long but we were assured it would move quickly so we decided to hang out. As we waited, we noticed people walk up and be seated. Did they have reservations? No. After about the 3rd time of witnessing this, we finally said something and were told they were here before us and our turn would soon come. After another 10 minutes or so of this B.S., we finally tracked down a manager who seated us, apologized, and comped the meal.  On other occasions, the service has been extremely slow or orders have been forgotten. This is a tiny spot. There isn't much room to get around and it gets really crowded in there. No sure what they were thinking with that concept. Also, they don't have a complete menu like other chains and the food usually isn't prepared right.

Holley L.,"Richmond, VA",122,142,134,4.0,9/20/2013,"I finally went here for lunch today with my mom and my grandma after years and years of driving by it. This is by far the smallest BJ's I have ever been to. It's located in the heart of downtown laguna beach, absolute prime location. Our server was named Morgan and he was a good server . Food-wise I usually order their delicious pizza but decided to branch out so I ordered the boneless teriyaki wings and they were good, not the best. I wouldn't say they were spicy per se, but they definitely had a kick to them. I'm a wuss but let's just say if I didn't have my sprite to drink my eyes would have been watering up and my nose running, but I'll say it again...i'm a wuss. I think if or when I go back I will go back to my normal pizza order because that's what they're known for. My grandma ordered the quesadilla and it was presented well on the plate, not to mention she said it was pretty tasty. My mom ordered the crusted chicken sandwich and it wasn't what she thought, she said it was alright but probably wouldn't order it again. Overall it was a good experience and I would probably go back. I hear it's insanely crowded at night and I believe it, the place is TINY for that amount of traffic! I also like the way the interior is set up, although it's small it gives off the impression that it is bigger than it is. 4 Stars: Yay!

We needed a few slices boxed up and she handed my wife a box and walked away....still leaving the five empty glasses on the table, the plates etc.   When the bill came, she was very quick and attentive.  She brought it back fast and then finally cleared the table for the next guest.  Of all of my experiences at BJ's, this one just sucked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-beach?start=100

Vivian W.,"Irvine, CA",149,11,2,1.0,7/2/2012,"Let me just say that this place is exceptional... Exceptionally bad. I almost never have a negative experience at a restaurant but this was just terribad. I came here after going to Laguna Beach with my twin and we were starving. 20 minutes after we ordered, the new waitress who served us apologized and said there was a holdup in the kitchen, and then proceeded to make senseless small talk but it was just awkward. It made us feel uncomfortable. That's excusable, and she's new, but it took more than FORTY minutes for our food to arrive. We would have liked to receive a free appetizer or something, but she made no such offer. Still, we were in a good mood so we would've been okay, if it weren't for what happened next. My fries were cold and stale so when she asked me how my food was I told her nicely. She said she would try to get me another hot plate of fries, and I was like okay cool. Then right after, when we barely even dived into our food after waiting for so long, she put the check down next to us and said ""take your time"" without even mentioning the fries. Really? Are you trying to be bad at this? Ten minutes later we asked her about it and she just went ""I know. There's a hold up in the kitchen."" and sort of set the water down hard. Are you effing kidding me?! Oh helllll no. Our entire experience & mood was ruined by the slower-than-a-snail speed & bad service. Before we were even finished with our food she tried to take our plates from us without even offering a to-go box. At least when my fries finally arrived she offered us a free pizookie for our trouble, that made it a bit better. We tipped her two dollars, to show her we were irritated but not cheap. Still, never coming here again. I expected better from a nice American place, especially next to the beach. Before dinner we were debating between Johnny Rockets down the street and BJ's.

Ruth R.,"Redondo Beach, CA",3,12,,1.0,7/5/2014,"This was my first time visiting a BJ's Restaurant and based on the experience, I have no desire to visit again. I ordered the California Burger which comes topped with avocado, roasted green chilies, pepper jack cheese and chipotle mayonnaise.  This ended up being one of the blandest burgers I have had in a long time.  The patty was unseasoned, the chilies flavorless and the mayonnaise watery without any chipotle flavor at all.  The bread was soggy when the plate arrived.  That says a lot of how long my order was waiting in the window.  The fries were soggy and unseasoned too.  The hardest part was paying more than $10 for this. My husband ordered the jambalaya.  His plate was just fine.  The shrimp, chicken and sausage were well seasoned but the vegetables were not fresh.  For this dish, a stew was prepared and served over white rice (instead of cooking everything as an integral dish).  This is not food I will want to have again (or pay about $17 for it). The ladies' restroom was completely disgusting.  I do not want to go into detail of what I saw but the lady who was going to use the facilities after me left with her two young daughters after seeing the conditions.  I hear her complaining to the employees about what she saw (with reason!).  Now, I may be able to tolerate bad food but not dirty places.  After reading other reviews about this particular restaurant, I believe they have some hygiene problems.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-beach?start=100

It's a really small location which makes it REALLY loud whenever you come here. The service can tend to be pretty slow, which I don't fully understand because it is a small location so there aren't that many tables to cover. The food is pretty decent, but like I said, service is hit and miss. There is one server who is awesome though so I do feel like he deserves a shout out. His name is Ish and he is awesome. He takes care of you and he is one of the servers that is pretty quick and covers everything. Not to mention he is super friendly!

Austin our waiter didn't actually identify himself as our waiter for at least 25 minutes. He was too busy flirting with some teenage girls sitting across from us. When he finally introduced himself, he seemed really clueless. In fact, while he was charming the young ladies, another employee who was not a waiter, came over to our table and did his best to take our order right before Austin finally showed up. The food was fine, but the service was far from adequate. The restaurant just wasn't that busy for a Saturday night and there was way too many employees not interfacing with their customers. Eventually, Austin found a few other women to converse with. I felt like a teenager at Al's Dinner from the ""Happy Days."" But instead of feeling elated from the 50's ambiance, I found myself angered by the aloof service. I wasn't looking to hang out at BJs three or four hours to socialize with my high school buddies. Just wanted to eat and be on my way as one would expect from a place that's serving pizza.

The restaurant wasn't too packed and we waited about 5 minutes to be seated. The waitress we had seemed a bit awkward or a bit uncomfortable/unhappy to serve us but that was excusable since she was new.  My friend ordered their Jalapeno burger with fries and I ordered a Scampi pasta. After 20 minutes, the waitress told us that the kitchen was backed up and that our food should be arriving soon. It seemed a little odd since the restaurant wasn't full but  we were in a happy mood so we didn't really mind. Another 15 minutes passed by and  I politely asked one of workers about our food. The worker seemed really surprised and asked for our waitress.  We finally received the food after a few minutes and my friend's dish came out stale and luke warm.  Really?! We waited over 40 minutes for luke warm food? We informed the waitress about the meal and she said she would replace it for us. She then gave us the check without mentioning anything about replacing my friend's food. Again, really?! We haven't even eaten yet and you're already giving us the check!?  I couldn't really enjoy my pasta since I felt really irritated by the wait and the service. By the time I was half way finished I asked her if we were still getting the food replaced and she said it was backed up and sort of slammed my glass of water on the table. I'm usually a really laid back person but that PISSED me off!  We finally got the food but decided to take most of it to go since we spent way too much time waiting around!  I think she got in trouble or something because she came back and offered us a free pazookie when we were ready to leave. It didn't really matter considering we were already pissed and the restaurant was practically empty.  I'm usually all about the food but when the service is crappy it just kills the whole dining experience.

You take a small deep dish, bake a cookie inside (pizza-cookie) and drop a few scoops of ice cream on top when finished.

Jeffrey T.,"Long Beach, CA",31,28,6,4.0,2/14/2017,"BJ's is fairly consistent from one place to another, but we really enjoyed our visit to BJ's in Laguna Beach. Michael, our server, was supremely skilled in customer service, personal interaction and patience. We were never rushed and he had great recommendations and suggestions when asked. He has onviously been doing this for awhile, because his demeanor was supremely friendly withou seeming condescending or trite (something that is all-too frequent in many places these days!). The food was excellent, as always. The new Mandarin Green Tea was a plus...I love iced tea and this one was a palatable revelation! The meal wasn't extraordinarily special, but BJ's is consistent and virtually ALWAYS on point with quality, portion and taste. Above all, the servce staff (like Michael) all seem to work together to deliver all patrons fast, eficient and comfortable service. I wouldn't normally travl from Long Beach to Laguna Beach just for BJ's, but when I am in Laguna Beach and want a predictbly delicious mal at a good price with outstanding servic, I know I can go to this BJ's and not be disappointed. Thanks for a nice lunchtime visit, Michael. You directly contributed to our enjoyable experience, just as much a the food!

Ralph L.,"Long Beach, CA",285,404,144,4.0,1/19/2015,"Love the location here in downtown Laguna Beach. Perfect way to refuel or relax after a long day at the beach or hiking the Laguna canyons. It's not even a bad place to take a date after walking around the city, since there are four tables here with ridiculously beautiful views of the beach and ocean. The host was very accommodating to our request for an ocean-view table, the manager hooked us up with a free mini pizookie for signing up for BJ's email spam, and of course, the pizza was good. My girlfriend liked lighter and fluffier crust on this deep-dish, though personally I prefer the thicker, buttery crust you'd find at Hollywood Pies, Rance's, Masa, or Costco. The kale and brussel sprouts salad was tasty, though suspiciously only had one brussel sprout.

M K.,"Laguna Beach, CA",0,9,,1.0,10/17/2016,"I have lived in Laguna for 7 years and never gone here. ive been to BJ's in other cities and it's ok but I prefer the unique/non chain places that I cant go to anywhere else. Plus it doesnt have a bar and I usually walk down to a restaurant alone and hate to take up a table when I can just take up a stool. today on my walk I stopped for lunch thinking it was time to see what it looked like inside (it is offseason, not busy). it's tiny, but was pretty empty so I didnt feel bad taking a table to myself. my server Christoper S came over and I ordered a glass of merlot (he didnt know what I was talking about, but I guessed it was because he wasnt really paying attention to me, not because it was an odd order. they only have one merlot on the menu so it shouldnt be hard). he brought it back and I ordered a chicken dish. he brought my dish out and it was fine but his service suggested he couldnt be bothered with me. after I started eating he came by to ask if I was done. I wasnt halfway through yet. he then came back to ask if I was done (again!) and I scarfed down the last bites while he stood and waited! I have no idea why he was so impatient. there were only about two other tables full and they werent his. he made me so uncomfortable but then angry. so when he took my plate I ordered another glass of wine (just to piss him off). he brought it and then asked if I would want a third or if he could bring the check!?? I have no idea what the rush was. there was no one waiting for a table. I sat there nursing my wine thinking maybe he was leaving and wanted to cash out (most servers tell you that if they are leaving), but he stayed working. apparently he just couldnt be bothered with me. I routinely visit and support many places in town and regularly tip 50%. im not sure why he chose to be rude to me and rush me out, but I wont be back and my inclination to stay away all this time was right.  bottom line, dont stand outside waiting for this place. go to watermarc, nicks, The Cliff, Gigi's or somewhere else instead.  p.s-the only nice interaction I had was a manager (?) who came over to ask me about email on my phone and chat a bit. perhaps he sensed how rude his server was...sadly for him I was actually already starting this review because I felt so uncomfortable and unwelcome by their server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-beach?start=40

After about half an hour our food arrived...no Spinach dip. When a DIFFERENT waitress brought us our food, we asked about the dip...just to make sure we didn't end up paying for it, and she said she would make sure it was cancelled and tell our waiter also. Ten minutes later, our waiter came over and said ""oh, you didn't get your dip...do you still want it?"" No apology. Then when we said no he simply asked ""Well, how's the food?""

When she finished she put her phone down and greeted us with the sassiest attitude (since we were such a bother and interrupted her super important text message or Instagram post, whatever she was doing.) She grabbed menus and handed them to the male host next to her so he could take us to our table and then went straight back to her phone. I thought this was so unprofessional. I never bother to post on yelp and probably wouldn't have if she didn't have such a not caring attitude. Service was a little slow but I'm a server and  I understand it was busy. Food was awesome as always. I've never been to this BJ's and really wanted to leave happy but they should definitely get some better customer service at the host stand!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-beach?start=160

Anthony M.,"Seattle, WA",1,8,7,1.0,3/3/2012,"Service was great. Waitress was very nice and prompt, but the pizza was horrible. I had the ""BJ's Favorite"" BJ'S favorite pizza must have been a Digornio, because that's exactly what it tasted like....Way too greasy crust and the toppings had to be the same they use at Pizza Hut. Plus 28 bucks for 2 mini pizzas and 4 sticks of garlic bread!?! Call me a pizza snob, but If I want to torture my tastebuds like that again, I'll get a Digornio with garlic bread combo in the freezer section for $8.99",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-beach?start=160
Elnaz S.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",2,12,,2.0,5/28/2011,"We came here for dinner on a Saturday night.  Everything about this place was mediocre except for the location (Great spot in the heart of the Laguna Beach strip area). The reason for the 2 rating: This particular BJ's location had a much smaller menu than other BJ's (no avocado rolls!).  The wait was long. The food was alright (We ordered the Veggie Burger and the California Burger) The staff seemed very mechanical, nothing memorable about the service here.  If the staff (server/hostess) were more outgoing and friendly, we would have probably given the place a 3 rating instead of a 2.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-beach?start=160
Ryan R.,"Dana Point, CA",0,1,,3.0,4/2/2012,"So it may not be exactly like the deep dish pizza you would find in the Windy city, it's not a bad place!  My wife and I really enjoy the pizza here and we especially enjoy the pazookies!  I will agree with another fellow yelp user and say that the hostesses are not the brightest nor are they the most considerate as they are sitting on their iPhones while you are standing there waiting for them to take your name.  I'm huge on customer service and our experiences with the hostesses influenced my decision in giving them three stars.   If you feel like a simple meal and not paying top dollar like you would at some of the other locations in town?  Then BJs might be a place you like.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-beach?start=160

I felt a little bad bringing my stroller and talkative child in there, but luckily it was not a busy Thursday! The wait staff was very nice and attentive.

Xerxes M.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,19,,5.0,5/20/2011,"BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is really a good spot to have a good time at the same time be satisfied and full with the food.  My friends and I picked this place randomly and we were all so happy with our selection. I think it was the best thing we ever decided on. LOL. So as we ordered our food, I noticed the menu has so much to offer. You would be really having a hard time choosing your meal because everything just looks so delicious.  So for the appetizer, we tried CHICKEN WINGS. It's more than a pound of crisp, tender chicken wings, drizzled with hot and spicy buffalo sauce and ranch dressing. Served with celery sticks, extra sauce and dressing for dipping. Wow, that was only for appetizer and we were already so happy with it! So we ordered the BJ'S FAVORITE pizza! Oven baked meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, black olives, white onions and seasoned tomatoes. I can't believe this pizza is so good that we were all quiet while we were eating. We're just savoring every moment of perfection. And last but not the least, desserts!! BJ'S FAMOUS PIZOOKIE,  save room for the often imitated, never duplicated, one and only original Pizookie®...freshly baked, hot out of the oven, rich and delicious cookie topped with two scoops of vanilla bean ice cream and served in its own deep dish and my choice of Chocolate Macadamia Nut. Just HEAVEN! We decided that we're going back again here to try some of their pasta, salads, and maybe the build your own pizza!! I'm recommending it to everyone, you should give it a try!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-beach?start=160
Carrie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",374,913,295,4.0,5/8/2007,"I'm so going to disagree with all the other reviews for the most part.  Yes, it's a small location and parking can be a bitch to say the least...not to mention the wait you'll probably have in order to get a table seeing as it's so ""wee"" inside.  BUT...the food is exactly the same as every other BJ's I've been too...and the beer is just as delish. What makes THIS BJ's so great is that it IS near the beach on PCH and that gives it some charm.  You can spend a day checking out the shops on Forest Ave. or plopped on your ass on the sand of Main Beach and then head on over for a mini pizza at BJ's. I recommend the mini pizza for one person: Veggie pizza with a side of ranch to dip in.  YUM.  Also...check out a taster of their beers...you can get a four taster OR a 7 taster...can beat the later for $8.50!! Then head on back outside and check out a kick butt sunset over the Pacific!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-beach?start=160
Ed M.,"Banning, CA",0,23,,3.0,2/18/2011,I usually know that I can rely on BJ's wherever I go but this one is a disappointment. It's a small location (about 50 seats) and a slimmed down menu. All beers are available. Food was fine but server really seemed at a loss even with only 4 2-tops.  Choices are slim in this town so BJ's is at least acceptable.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-beach?start=160

Has about 20 tables for two and six or seven booths. Manager with goatee and glasses isn't managing the restaurant, he stands out front with sweet hostess and fiddles with the football games on TV but never spoke to employees for the hour we were there. Floor dirty, table dirty, bathroom papers tossed around and crowded kitchen also not clean. 37 minutes for our veggie pizza (ordered it many times before) but the crust was not cooked through. Tired and my son only wanted the yummy chocolate chip cookie with ice cream ( was great) Service friendly and kind from ""Mike"" There were 6-7 servers for 12 filled tables.

Jimmy L.,"Chicago, IL",5,27,,2.0,9/25/2010,"I hate that the first reviews I'm giving are so low, but I want to be honest here...  Service was OK, we didn't have to wait for seating, though the place definitely fills up. We were there on a weeknight, relatively early and it was full. I think I remember seeing something about 'Chicago style', but when we asked about spinach we were told they only had the spinach and artichoke 'pre-mix' (ugh) and don't offer spinach as a topping. Hello? I'm not a pizza snob, but I LOVE pizza, and I loves me my thick Chicago-style stuffed spinach pizza (Giordanos). So we ordered sausage, peperoni and extra cheese, medium pan style. Surprised that there wasn't much flavor. Fresh enough, hot, crust was OK, but just not spicy enough.   For the price, I would not return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-beach?start=160
Ellen R.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,21,,5.0,5/31/2009,"My five-star rating is just for the deep dish pizza and its croissant-like crust.  It is delectable!  As a former Chicagoan, I claim some expertise in deep dish pizza (eating, not making), and I've got to say that B.J.'s makes the best.  I've never had any crust like that.  Ever.   We live in Phoenix, so we have BJ's here, too, but the best BJ experience is in Laguna.  Don't bother standing in the those long lines along PCH every night or sit in the cramped restaurant, even though it can be enjoyable on a good day with the shutters open.  Instead, opt for going to take-out and go eat your pizza on the boardwalk at Main Beach.  Just something about that sand blowing on there!   I haven't had much else at B.J.'s  The multicolored chips and salsa was very good.  Didn't care much for the thin crust pizza appetizer.   The Pazooki (huge hot cookie served in a pie plate with ice cream on top) is yummy, but the last one I had, it was uncooked in the center.  However, you get a free one if you tell them it's your birthday!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-beach?start=160

Our waitress was very nice and polite, and that is always important to me. They have outdoor seating too, but I only recommend sitting outside during the day, becase it's pretty cold during the night since it's right next to the beach.

I thought .. oh a ""chain"" and I saw the bags of ingredients already mixed and immediately I wished we could have gone somewhere else...but we choose dif. toppings and it came out and it was hot and it was OK.. but for a pizza place to liken themselves even remotely to Chicago style deep dish and not even have  a spinach topping is just well disappointing.. so even though, for the $ the food and atmosphere and service were OK..

jay c.,"DuPont, WA",0,3,,3.0,3/4/2011,"Well I ventured to Bj's to have a quiet dinner with my wife. Our wait time was not too long and i was able to converse with the host to pass the time  while the wait elapsed. I accidently stumbled upon his conversation with another host in regards to how he kicked a pidgeon? I was very disturbed in regards to this conversation so i returned back to my wife. Debating whether to stay or leave...we stayed.  Around 15 minutes we were seated at a nice booth. The atmosphere was nice, a clear, clean restaurant. The servers all seemed nice and helpful throughout our stay. Midway through out meal, I believe, the general manager approached our table and began to speak with us about our stay and how everything was. At first it seemed like a nice gesture until he would not leave my wife and I alone to enjoy our meals.... It began to consume the majority of the time we were able to stay there and became quite frustrating. I actually politely asked him if he would leave us to our meals but he had hearing aid in so i dont think he heard me.  A few minutes after he left we were able to finish our meals.  We left the restaurant, and as we passed the host we noticed him giving his phone number to girls that seemed way to young for him. Overall a great trip but they have very interesting people in terms of the gm and host. I believe bjs is an equal opportunity restaurant which would explain why they had such an interesting host....didnt seem like the sharpest tool in the shed",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-laguna-beach?start=180
