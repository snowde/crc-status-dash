We went there for dinner last night and I really wanted a particular frozen drink but wanted it with rum instead of vodka, the bartender was more than willing to sub it out for what I wanted.

V G.,"Monterey County, CA",23,70,273,2.0,1/7/2018,The drive up service is slow. It seemed a lot of workers were walking around with not much to do. I'm guessing it was a busy night. The dish I had was greasy and gross. I had an Asian peanut chicken and noodle dish but it left a lot to be desired.

Chris I.,"Hot Springs National Park, AR",16,86,430,3.0,1/1/2017,Had dinner here with some of my best friends. There were lots of delicious looking food on the menu. Service was pretty good. Our waiter was nice and friendly and always had a smile on her face. We were well attended. Atmosphere was very calming. It was a little chilly in there tonight though.  Food came in at a decent time. When I got my order it was pretty oily. Not sure if that's how it really is prepared but my other friends plate was also oily. Too much oil that is! The taste was different but could be better. Need to try other dishes and see if they are also about the same oiliness. Maybe I could try this place again. Give it another chance. Hopefully our dishes won't be as oily.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-little-rock
Savannah M.,"Little Rock, AR",0,4,,1.0,11/18/2017,"Update: Didn't post this review before. I went again with higher hopes and was not impressed so I decided to post it. ... Here at 5:30 and the restaurant is really empty. I see waitstaff leisurely walking around and talking. Five waitstaff are gathered at the entryway. I ask for a table for nine and I'm told it will be a 20 minute wait. Wait for what?  Still sitting here and a group of four walks in and gets a table, group of two, another group of two, group of three. Im confused. I've waited tables all my life, it's not hard to put two tables together.  Ordered shrimp and asked them to be sautéed in oil instead of butter because of my nephews allergy. Came out in butter.  Drinks pretty much stayed empty and the food was mediocre at best.  Happy Mother's Day to us!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-little-rock

Sean T.,"Little Rock, AR",1,38,,1.0,4/6/2017,"Horrible chain corporate restaurant. As with most places like this the food obviously comes out of a can or a pouch. If you're going to be an out-of-state chain restaurant in a market full of exceptional local options you should be incredibly good to compete BJs is not good, and they do not compete. On top of that their beer is pretty consistently horrible. Don't be fooled, they do not brew beer in the state of Arkansas. They import it from some out-of-state giant conglomerate. I'm a firm believer or that the Arkansas brewery scene is good enough where you don't have to shop out of state anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-little-rock

Brian C.,"Memphis, TN",0,13,,5.0,11/30/2016,"BARTENDER**** I can't speak for everyone but the bartender - Diane is a class act. She understands the ins/outs of the business and the good/bad patrons. None deteriorate her energy which is absolutely vital to the atmosphere. Hats off - grab a beer or three and open up a conversation with Diane. I dont know her personally and I've never set foot in this bar,  I don't have a reason for posting this review other than watching her running the bar the way it should be run - but more so felt the need over the diversity she deals with nightly.

No one showed up for another 15 min, we noticed the waitress having some conflict with what must have been a manager, finally the manager came and took our appetizer order and pushed us to order the meal at the same time.

Otherwise, I'd be giving it ONE STAR. In fact, our first encounter with Carmen was when no one at the hostess station seemed to be tending to is, and she acknowledged our presence. Even after that, they couldn't seem to agree on where to seat us. SEVERAL problems with our order due to what has to be an incompetent kitchen -- sweet tea instead of unsweet tea, two of the same type tacos although I'd ordered two different ones, no cous cous with my son's salmon and no ice cream with my husband's dessert.

But, I must factor in the rest of the food. This was the second time I had been to a BJ's and I wasn't sold last time either. This time I ordered a small dish of mac and cheese because we had eaten a big lunch. The bacon in it was very smokey, like overly smokey. Also it wasn't very creamy. I enjoyed the bread that came with it and I did end up eating all of it but it could have been better. I ordered a raspberry lemon drop which was very strong. The sugar around the rim did help a little.

The last time (03/05/2017) has convinced me that I will probably just continue to use the other location. I walk in around 11:45 and I am seated pretty quickly. Then I waited 15 minutes, though the area that I was in was not busy. Finally after 15 minutes another waiter (Kevin) asked me if I had been helped, I shook my head negatively, and told me to give him a few he would get me served. Kevin came got my order, and went to put in my order. While waiting for my drink, the waiter that I was supposed to be served by, comes up and gets a little upset that they didn't give me a menu, until I explain that another waiter came and took my order after having to wait so long for him. I won't call him out because I do not know if he is just extremely new or what, but the lack of awareness just got to me. My chicken Paidina was over cooked but not ruined.

I tried one of the deep dish pizzas, which was mainly ALL bread (which I love, don't get me wrong) - but had few, if hardly any, toppings. It wasn't even close to comparable to true Chicago style pizza. My husband also had a steak, which was overcooked (despite ordering ""medium"") - it was definitely well done.

The menu lists all of their items with their calories, which is super helpful. I tried the Bison Burger, which was DELICIOUS and supposedly light, heh. We went on a Friday night, so it was pretty packed, but they've got a nice bar to sit at to let the time pass.  They've got a pretty decent selection of beers.

This does more to appreciate a complex beer and also allows time for the drinker to get a bearing on how much they have had..... My very nice waitress was probably told this because she told me it was similar to a Guinness, don't confuse the two styles, Guinness is light and creamy. An imperial stout is strong, black, bold, resinous, and sometimes bitter(which was the case for this one), and has 2 to 3 times the alcohol, 2 in this comparison.......  I like imperials and this was a decent imperial(think Old Rasputin with less flavor). 4 stars only because of lack of beer knowledge and missing a key ingredient in an otherwise tasty appetizer.... ....

Michelle ..,"Midland, TX",2,34,15,1.0,8/14/2014,"I been here a twice since they been opened but my last visit the service was horrible! I really hate when a dining experience is ruined by poor service.  The food here is good for a chain but we had such a terrible experience with the service I can't give them more than 1 star. When the server/expediter brought our food and another waiter helped put the food on our tables. Which is understandable since waiters help each other out. We see our waiter on the computer checking out tabs of a large party ~10 people.  However, there were a few condiments that they forgot to bring out (salad dressing and bbq sauce ) along with hot sauce so we asked for and we waited and it never came out. By this time this party of 10 is already gone and he only had 2 tables to serve. Our waiter was nowhere to be seen so we had to ask another waiter, in which she told us that she will tell our waiter and let him know. We waited and still didn't get any condiments.  Our waiter is still missing so I got the attention of another waiter who was passing by us and told him that we are missing our condiments and have asked several times. This 2nd waiter returned with our condiments and since our waiter has gone missin my friend asked if she can order soup. So the 2nd waiter puts in our order and brings it to us.  Our REAL waiter did not ask how we doing, how the food was, or fill our water -- basically did not check up on us at all until time for the check and then asked who ordered the soup since we asked for separate checks. We came in the middle of the week day and it was not busy by any means, there was about 7-8 tables filled in the whole restaurant. There was a couple across from us and they were not happy either. As the guy's steak was over cooked and service was also lacking. I overheard their conversation with the manger and she did not make things any better so I didn't even want to waste my time. We ended up did not tipping our REAL waiter and tipped the other waiter that actually did help us (and his area/zone was on the other side of the restaurant)! He was surprised but very grateful and thanked us. I'm not sure if the waiters at BJ's pool their tips and divide them later but because of this experience, I hope they don't pool their tips!

It was watery and tasted like the syrup bag needed to be changed, perhaps. He took the drink and came back with another one. She tried it, and AGAIN, it was watery. She told him that it still tastes funny, like carbonated water. He told her something to the effect of, ""I tried it and it tasted fine."" She just told him to bring her water, which he did. She felt nervous about drinking it because of his attitude. We were all so angry that we didn't even think to ask for a manager to tell him what happened. We just wanted to get out of there.  As far as the food is concerned, it was okay. Nothing spectacular or unique that would make me think about going back. I had salmon, mashed potatoes and chili with calamari as an appetizer.

For my meal I started off with a ""twisted BLT"" side salad that was spot on in flavor. It was baby spinach with bacon, chopped tomato, boiled egg, and a vinaigrette.  Then I had the Cajun Jambalaya.  It was not a heavy cream sauce but a well rounded tangy with mild heat in the back if your trough rice concoction with loads of blacken chicken breast bites, shrimp with sausage to boot.  Now the low point was service was slow and a bit off sync with each other in the check in area, however I will take slow service over a pesky server.  My glass of root beer never emptied before refilled and the food was most enjoyable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-little-rock?start=80

Tom B.,"Maumelle, AR",3,22,,1.0,10/11/2014,"Visited here a couple weeks earlier for a company dinner and had a GREAT experience, so decided to make it a lunch outing for us and our neighbors.  Went here for lunch with 7 others (2 families of 4).  Was seated immediately, and had 2 great tables right where we wanted.  Then, everything went downhill.  The store was not very busy, but it took our server  several minutes to come by, and longer to bring us fountain drinks.  1 person's food came within 15 minutes, then - 20 minutes later - the rest of our's came.  The kids' food was warm enough to eat, but mine and one other's burger was on the cool side of room temperature.  A pizza was luke-warm, but she didn't want to wait for a re-cook.  We asked the server to simply ""nuke"" the burgers and bring them back.  Fast forward to 20 minutes later - still waiting for those burgers.  Drink glasses have been empty for a while.  We were making trips to the bar and even into the service area to fill our drinks.  No manager, no server, nobody made any attempt to let us know what was happening.  Finally, we hijacked a busboy and asked for the manager.  He said our burgers would be out in a few minutes.  Nope, didn't happen.  Ended up getting the burgers to-go, so - I'll review a Fried Jalepeno Burger that was taken home and eaten a few hours later.  The fried japs were extremely soggy.  The wedge fries were extremely soggy.  The buns were... well, you get the picture.  The server was polite, but (I believe not adequately trained.  There is no excuse for the manager's nonchalant attitude; no explanation for that.  Not sure what has happened in the past 2 weeks to turn this from a 5-star experience to a 1-star disaster, but don't come here expecting hot food, cold drinks, and good service at this time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-little-rock?start=80
G. A.,"Little Rock, AR",0,3,,2.0,10/5/2014,"Food good,  service horrible,  maybe management will get the hint!!!!! Will not go back till I hear good reports!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-little-rock?start=80
Brenda G.,"San Diego, CA",2,3,,1.0,8/27/2014,We had high hopes for this new bar/restaurant. I have been here 3 times and every time the service has been horrible and the food has not been consistent. This last trip was the worst!  Went for lunch. Note it was not busy!  Our waiter acted like his head was somewhere else. I asked for water 4 times. Our food came out in stages. There were 6 of us and they'd bring a couple of people their food then 5 min later someone else a couple of minutes and two more people got lunch. I waited patiently for my Mac and Cheese and finally had to ask if it was coming. This might have been fine if our food was hot but it was cold and to top that off nothing like the last time we ate there. I asked the manager if they had changed their recipe on some of the food they informed me the chef did that from time to time. You would think a place this size would be ran with policies and procedures that would help their restaurant succeed. Consistency is a must. If this place doesn't get some help it won't be around long. Sad to say!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-little-rock?start=80
Steven S.,"Roland, AR",1,13,1,3.0,5/2/2014,"I ate here on May 1, 2014, arriving about 11:30 am for lunch.  I ordered the soup and salad lunch special, and a side order of wedge cut fries. The salad was excellent, freshly made, and the Caesar dressing was among the best I've ever eaten.  The Clam Chowder and fries were both hot, but pre-fabricated far from Little Rock.  BJ's gets three stars instead of more for using pre-fabricated base for the clam chowder, and frozen French fries instead of housemade fries from fresh potatoes, though in my experience few Arkansans know the difference or care. The servers were well-dressed, pleasant, intelligent and articulate.  Prices are competitive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-little-rock?start=100
Charles Z.,"Siloam Springs, AR",0,5,,1.0,4/28/2014,"We LOVE BJs,.... Just not this BJs.  Service was slow (we were the first ones in the door at 11 am but couldn't get seated for 10 minutes due to ""no waitstaff"").  Even though it was early and there were few customers, it took forever to be waited on/served.  Drink order was not correct and calamari appetizer was less than half the size that we have been served at any other BJs anywhere else. (Even though the calamari was only one layer deep it still didn't even begin to cover the platter.... This did provide us with a laugh and guessing game on where the rest of it went....) Just a terrible experience from a chain that has always exceeded our expectations everywhere else.  Can't wait to go to Texas and enjoy BJs again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-little-rock?start=100
