Jennifer S.,"Portland, OR",669,562,1974,4.0,5/27/2014,"Tonight's dinner was brought to you by BJs. I actually love this place as far as chain restaurants. The variety of food is perfect without overdoing it. I can't complain about the food, because I can't ever remember having a bad meal. Tonight, I went with three other people. We got there at the same time as everyone else... so, there was a little bit of a wait. But it was pretty quick getting a table. We ordered many things... a beer, waters, avocado egg rolls, a wedge salad, tortilla soup, shrimp scampi, ahi poke, a house salad, and a chocolate chip pazookie. No complaints as far as food goes! I love finishing dinner up with dessert... and you can't go wrong with a pazookie. Mmmmm... I took away one star, because the service was ""meh..."" It was the bare minimum this evening, but it didn't ruin the whole dinner for us as everything was brought out in a timely manner and drinks were refilled.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-long-beach
Sam W.,"Long Beach, CA",447,400,839,1.0,5/21/2014,"I came here with a couple friends Thursday night. We had just eaten dinner at Simmzy's, where it was super busy and packed. We walked across the street from Simmzy's to BJ's for some pizookie and were surprised to see BJ's so empty.  SERVICE: Sat down & our server promptly came by to ask if we wanted drinks. When we said we just wanted water, she seemed disappointed and said ""Oh"". She came by again three times in a short period to check if we had decided on what we wanted. We decided to get a pizookie with half chocolate chip, half cookies and cream pizookie. Once again the server gave off a vibe that she didn't want to serve us now that we only ordered one thing. We didn't see her again after she dropped off our pizookie. Not a great place to get service, I guess.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-long-beach
Cat N.,"Orange County, CA",4274,1319,5891,1.0,3/6/2014,"This location is the worst I have been to I arrived on 3/5/14 at around 12:30pm with my girlfriend and sister for lunch.  I was instantly turned off when I walked through the door at how tiny and muggy it it was inside.  The A/C was turned off and it was dark and depressing.  The size was small as the BJ's bar in the Huntington Beach location.  Tiny!  Despite the disappointment, we decided to tell the hostess that we would like a table by the window for some light.  It took forever for our waitress to come back so we can order.  I'd say 15 minutes.  We had to flag her down.  My girlfriend and I got the endless soup and salad with drinks.  My sister got the flatbread and a garden salad.  We also ordered some Santa Fe spring rolls to share.  By that point, the A/C finally came in and were were no longer dying from heat, just dying from waiting.  They did not bring all our food out at once. My food came out first, then my girlfriend, then it took another 10 minutes for my sisters flatbread. Her salad didn't come until another 10 minutes when the waitress finally realize she forgot it.  My girlfriend had ordered a lemonade.  She had drank it half way and the dumb waitress came to refill it.   She ended up pouring water instead into her cup.  On the way to refill the wrong drink, she also spilled into our table.  As for the food, it was crap.  It was made differently here.  For example, normally my sisters flatbread and salad would come on the same plate at other locations. Hers didn't and was extremely small. It looked like a snack.  A couple of lettuce sprinkled on a plate and two piece of flatbread.  My tortilla soup was extremely salty.  I felt like I was eating salt.  The Caesar salad was bland.  Oh and the appetizer, the Santa Fe spring rolls came out last.  That was the only thing that was okay.  Our total was $48 for 3 lunch specials an 1 appetizer.  I'm never coming back to this location ever.  I recommend you to go the other 638482 restaurants on 2nd street if you want decent food with decent service and atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-long-beach

Cindy B.,"Los Angeles, CA",1339,1055,93,3.0,12/12/2013,"Well, it's BJ's.  It's great for big groups, but the food was lacking.  My friends and I ordered a bunch of appetizers. Here's the breakdown. Avocado Egg Rolls: These were ok. Santa Fe Spring Rolls: Also ok. Margarita Pizza: The best of what we ordered. Spinach Artichoke Dip: This was the worst spinach artichoke dip ever. Do not get this.  Ahi Poke: This was the second best item we ordered and I would order it again. Would I come back? No. Unless I really wanted a pizookie.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-long-beach
Michelle A.,"Lakewood, CA",2,5,6,2.0,4/26/2014,"The Cobb salad was lacking in flavor. I'm aware that it's not really possible to mess up a salad but my salad was made with lettuce that was no longer fresh. It was already brownish and the pieces of turkey and bacon were not enough to mask the flavor of the bad salad. I could have gotten a better salad at Fresh & Easy for about $5 instead of $13.       The pizza, on the other hand, was very delicious. I got a pepperoni extreme pizza and that was very tasty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-long-beach
Rose C.,"Milpitas, CA",227,364,198,2.0,11/12/2013,"Not the best experience with BJs. I've been to several in the bay area, and those were all huge, bustling, and had great music and vibe. Since this restaurant is a LOT smaller, it doesn't have that same feel as another BJs might. The lighting was very bright and kitchen-like and there was hardly any music or background noise. Awkward, really.  I came in and there was a 15 minute wait but there were many tables available. I was told that there was a party of 43 coming in. We ordered a beer and a cider. My cider was not filled to the brim, rather, just a little over half. I didn't say anything since I don't drink much, but my boyfriend was peeved.  He ordered a spicy jalapeno cheeseburger and I got The Great White which is a usual favorite at BJs. My boyfriend's fries came out first, which was weird. The waitress said ""Here's your side order of fries,"" which confused us because we did not order a side. The waiter who took our order came back later and apologized and said it was a part of the meal and he wasn't sure why they were sent out so early. By then, the seasoned fries were lukewarm because we weren't sure if we should eat it or not. The Great White was a disappointment. I asked for Spinach in the pizza, but really they just dumped it on top and it was burnt. Not happy about that. Then the edges of the pizza were burnt black as well (I've got pictures to prove it, hah) and overall the taste was mediocre. I've had just better where the pizza was the perfect temperature and the crust was crunchy and moist.  Definitely will NOT be here again and would NOT recommend it to others. The only reason it is 2 stars instead of 1 is because the hostess handled everything flawlessly with that group of 43 people, AND still managed to check on my table despite that being the waiter's job.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-long-beach
Jennifer T.,"Las Vegas, NV",593,553,729,4.0,4/7/2014,"3.5 Stars The smallest location I've ever been. I came around 10:30 on a Saturday night and the restaurant was pretty empty. There's no visible bar and only 3 booths.  I ordered the wedge salad and it was DRENCHED in dressing. It was like I was eating lettuce in a dressing soup. I'm not sure how their salads are, but to be safe next time I'll get dressing on the side.  I don't really like the avocado egg rolls here because there's no meat in them. I think its just avocado chunks with sun dried tomatoes.  We also got half a mediterranean pizza and chicken bacon ranch I believe,both were quite good but a bit salty. Service was better here then at any other locations I've been to. Our server set the pizza down and asked us which slice we wanted first, then set the slice on our plate.  We ordered the salted caramel pizookie and it was soooo good. Its new and definitely worth a try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-long-beach
Shelley C.,"Los Angeles, CA",470,646,461,3.0,12/11/2013,"I am a huge fan of BJs. This location is actually the smallest BJs I've ever been to. So if you'd rather be in a huge room with tons of people and commotion, go to the BJs in Cerritos instead. This BJs is nice when I've gone on dates, because it's not as loud and packed as other locations. The service here is only okay, however. No one has really gone above and beyond, or been particularly nice. The food I still love, so I'm happy with that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-long-beach
Jennifer T.,"Washington, DC",48,195,99,3.0,12/6/2013,"Gluten free crust with choice of toppings-- excellent! Better than z pizza gluten free crust, which is saying a lot. But service at this particular Bj fell short. Our server and runners were average-- nice, but definitely didn't go the full mile. I had to insist that ""I don't know"" when asked whether an item was gluten free was not a sufficient response.  He may not be entirely at fault since it is up to management to educate their staff about food allergy and intolerance. Odd then that when our server asked the manager, she snapped at him in front of us.... Awkward.  If you have gf items on your menu, your staff should know why... It's more than just ""I don't like mayo in my sandwich."" All in all, I'll order another gf pizza from Bj, but probably won't return to this one. 4* for food, 1* for service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-long-beach
Zach P.,"Long Beach, CA",127,582,210,2.0,6/29/2013,"The food here looks, smells, feels and tastes like corporate food.   We came in specifically because my wife was craving the Pizookie, their deep dished chocolate chip cookie that is topped with vanilla ice cream, which frankly, can be made at home with a little effort.   I had the jambalaya and my had the thin crusted BBQ chicken pizza.  The jambalaya was truly a disappointment as the ingredients did not taste fresh at all.  It tasted like typical corporate fare.  I didn't try the pizza, but from previous experiences, it wasn't anything memorable.  We also tried the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms which were OK, but was basically their spinach dip stuffed in the mushrooms and topped with Parmesan cheese.   They do have a good beer selection however.  So I would just recommend coming in here for a beer and a Pizooke.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-long-beach

Andrea V.,"Long Beach, CA",696,766,5296,3.0,1/22/2010,"Yes, I checked yelp before going here. Yes, I know it only has 2 1/2 stars. But sometimes you have to go where the group wants, especially if you are in the area and someone has a gift card. (But I'd much rather go to the Cerritos location if I am going to BJ's.) Overall, the service wasn't too bad. A bit slow, but thanks to yelp, I was expecting it. My only real complaints were that the mozzarella sticks didn't come out fresh and hot like we'd hoped, they were warm, but the cheese was not melty (like you can tell it sat there for awhile before we got it). Also, they give you such a tiny amount of marinara that we had to ask for more and by the time we (finally) got it, the mozzarella sticks had cooled off even more. We tried some of their beers and cider.    I'm not much of a beer drinker, but I really liked the cider.  One member of our party ordered one of the lunch specials. They are pretty affordable. Most are between around $6-$8. (Like a one topping mini pizza with a salad for $5.95.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-long-beach

Allie F.,"Seattle, WA",9,55,32,2.0,4/8/2014,"This was my first time at a BJ's, and my last. I was in here with a friend last Tuesday, and completely underwhelmed.  I'm not one to complain about slow service unless it's reeeaaally slow. Let me preface this with there were three other tables in the restaurant. We waited the host stand a few minutes for a hostess to show up and seat us. Then we waited several minutes to even be greeted, another two or three for waters. By the time our water came out we were ready to order. Fried artichokes and two salads (yea the grease kind of negates the greens, I know), and a drink for each of us. Apps come out, drinks come out, all ok. Not great but not awful. Then we wait.  And wait some more.  And wait a little bit more.  I used the restroom and came back to my friend telling me the waitress forgot to put our food in. Suddenly 35 minute salads made sense. We finally get our salads, which were ok. We both agreed neither had enough meat. I wouldn't call it even close to 4 oz.  We ordered pizookies for desert and as we are waiting another girl comes over to let us know our waitress has left for the day. Hmm. Maybe she thought we wouldn't tip cause we are young but we are both in the industry and would've still left a decent tip despite her slow service. Not her fault the food sucked. Either way I was annoyed she didn't come over and do the typical hand-off speech, just left. We ate the pizookies which were the best part of the meal, and flagged down our new waitress for the bill. She was nice enough, wish she had been our waitress the entire time.  Bottom line-mediocre Applebee's style food is not my cup of tea, especially if the entire experience is going to drag on for hours.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-long-beach
June Y.,"Long Beach, CA",241,198,303,2.0,10/9/2011,"1. It's in Belmont Shore - on 2nd avenue. 2. Therefore, it's small. Really small. 3. Therefore, parking is a nightmare 24/7. 4. Therefore, I don't really like going here. I still very much enjoy the Jambalaya that BJ's serves. Along with the beer they sell, it makes a great meal. So WHEN I go to this BJ's, I can satisfy myself with the items on the menu.  Fact: this BJ's does not have a bar. Therefore, they cannot serve you any hard alcohol. Don't expect to go here and receive all the same amenities of every other BJ's I've seen/been to. Only alcohol they serve is beer (and wine, I think). The decor is nice. Red bricks and exposed ceiling beams certainly concur with the brewhouse feel. The layout is rather cramped because they have to pack in as many tables, chairs, and booths as possible. If I remember correctly, the bathroom is one-person-at-a-time restroom, which means you'll have to wait until the person in front of you is done. It's not unusual to see a line of ladies (and guys) lined up in the narrow hallway in the back.  My thought is, WHY? If you're out with a group of friends and you're looking for a good time, there are PLENTY of choices on 2nd avenue where you can get beer and liquor, where you can spaciously sit, and get served better food. If you're on an intimate date, there are better places for that, too. It simply doesn't make sense to me why there's a BJ's in Belmont Shore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-long-beach

Stephen T.,"League City, TX",818,324,880,4.0,8/29/2011,"My girlfriend and I went here for dinner on a random Sunday... We live down the street but have never actually been here before (mostly because we aren't huge expensive pizza fans). This day was different, we decided to go here to get something other than pizza.... We arrived and were greeted quickly and nicely... We got 2 waters and looked over the menu, which for the record is VERY extensive... She ordered the Mediterranean Vegetable Pasta and I got the Grilled Chicken Club (photos attached). I got mine with the ""skinny crisp fries"", which was a great decision. When the food came out (which was very quick) we were asked what else we needed, and he promptly brought ranch, ketchup and BBQ sauce... PROS: Price ($25 w/ tip for both meals), she was able to get a healthy meal, the calories per meal are listed right on the menu, service was prompt and very nice, flavor was decent. CONS: Fries were a bit cold, it was not THE GREATEST flavor I have ever had, fries were a bit cold. A well earned 4 out of 5 stars...

Aryan O.,"Long Beach, CA",111,537,26,3.0,3/16/2012,"Like i said with most of the restaurant franchises on 2nd Street the BJ's here is pretty small. They have all the same food and beer that you would find at any other BJ's, but just really compact. I can only imagine when this place gets busy, where do people wait to be seated, usually they would probably hang outside the place.  But the hand full of times I've been to this place they weren't really that busy. There would be at least 3 more tables instead of us in the restaurant. Like every other restaurant I try and see if they have Jambalaya on the menu, and BJ's does have a pretty good Jambalaya. I was craving a burger this time so I tried the Jalapeno Burger. It usually comes with red onions, fried jalapenos, jack cheese lettuce and tomatoes. I added sauteed mushrooms to my burger and got it with thin cut fries. The fries were surprisingly really good. If they can make the fries into truffle cheese fries than BJ's would have it all! There are TVs around but if you don't sit on a certain spot you will be squinting to see the TV. Other than that give this place a try and don't be discouraged on the small capacity of the place.

Elizabeth O.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",197,193,63,4.0,1/25/2011,"Before I had to start eating GF, I loved BJ's pizza. I always made it a point to wait in the long line outside the restaurant during the Stroll & Savor events, then take the pizza inside for their seasonal beer specials. The pizza isn't like any other pizza and I would call it a hybrid style crust. It is fluffy and chewy but with a buttery crunch. It reminds me of a pizza back east that I loved (East of Chicago). The other food is good too. The mac & cheese is quite tasty and the salads are always fresh. So when I had to stop eating gluten I had to say goodbye to BJ's pizza. I shed my tears and got over it. That is until they introduced a new gluten free crust option. Now I could go to BJ's with friends and actually get pizza. I was ecstatic and couldn't wait to try it. Some places do GF pizza right and some don't. I am happy to report that BJ's does it right! Cross contamination risk be damned.  They are now my favorite place to get gluten free pizza in the entire Long Beach/Orange County area. The crust is a thin crust (as is typical of GF) but it is crispy and chewy all at once. It actually tasted like real pizza. Plus, you can get a plain cheese or pepperoni pizza for under $10. I opted for the 4+ toppings option for only $13. The pizza was filling and delicious. It really hit the spot and I will definitely be back for more shortly. I would even venture to say that non-glutards would enjoy it too. Top that off with a helping of their gluten free soup (actual, creamy gluten free soup) and a Redbridge beer and you will have a tummy-friendly meal. Something that has always felt strange about the restaurant, given the fact that it is a brewery, is the lack of a bar. When I used to drink here I hated that a you had to sit at a table for a beer, especially since the servers always seem bothered by the fact that you just want beer.  Parking isn't anything to complain about. ALL parking in Belmont Shore sucks. That's why you just pick a spot somewhere, anywhere and stroll along to whatever venue you like. That, in my opinion, is part of the adventure. ""Oohh, ohh, ohh I see a spot right there behind the pink hybrid! Is it big enough? Yes! Score!""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-long-beach?start=20

Felice B.,"Mission Viejo, CA",3,70,,4.0,5/24/2014,"BJ's, I'm trying to put you back on the map. The reviews are so dreadful but my experience was just the opposite. I'm not doubting anyone, mind you, and there's always room for improvement... We were to be strolling the main drag of Belmont Shores and had hoped for a reservation at Nick's on 2nd...which we could not obtain. Our fault. Poor planning.  I do not care for chain restaurants, I cannot stress that enough.  On this particular day it was very hot outside and A/C was a must. None of the trendy spots had theirs on but once my sons spied BJ's it was all over...they HAD to go! My husband nor I had never been so we were game. I'm glad we ventured in. A/C was not on but they were happy to turn it on for us...(were we really the only ones in the vicinity looking to escape the 85 degree weather?) Service was swift and friendly and our food was really good.  I had a parmesan crusted chicken with cheesy potatoes that was served hot and was very tasty. My husband thoroughly enjoyed his fish and chips and my sons each had a mac & cheese starter that they devoured (came with garlic bread of all things!!! - is this where Domino's got that crazy, heinous pasta bread bowl idea??) and they shared a thin crust pepperoni pizza which everyone at the table sampled and enjoyed. I had 2 very good glasses of chardonnay, the rest had soft drinks and the bill was still under $85, excluding a well-earned 25% tip. Here's what could have made it better: Cleaning supplies!!  Cleaning regimen!! Tables, chairs and menus need a thorough cleaning! It was confusing to watch a staffer dusting frames on the wall by the bathroom when the areas where people sit and touch needed some good old-fashioned soap and water. A good vacuuming wouldn't hurt either! I would go back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-long-beach?start=20

There was a mild dirty smell, but not so over powering I'd have to leave.  To drink, I got an iced tea. It had an odd flavor. I'm not sure if it was brewed or from concentrate but it wasn't good. To eat I ordered the sliders from the happy hour menu. Two sliders with ketchup and a pinch of onions. The buns were soft and fresh. I would have liked more onions. The plate also came with shoe string French fries, which weren't very good.  For dessert I ordered a chocolate chip pizookie  with vanilla ice cream and hot fudge. The cookie was baked on the outside, but still gooey in the center.

We were seated upon arriving and the drinks came out pretty quickly. I ordered a chopped salad...I know, pretty dumb to not order their specialty which is pizza but I guess I wasn't that hungry. Oh and I gotta say that the salad was just ok...I now realize that I hate chopped salads. They seem messier and less satisfying than regular salads.

JacqueLin O.,"Long Beach, CA",343,189,138,2.0,9/20/2010,"We had a craving for Pizza and could NOT decide which restaurant would fulfill it.  BF suggested BJ's because he heard it was a kind of Chicago style deep dish pizza. We decided to give it a try, because it didn't HURT that they are home of the pazookie (pizza cookie)  I had been to BJ's a few years ago and didn't really remember much about it except the pazookie and THAT itself was even vague.  BF said he loved the avocado rolls and ordered them as appetizer. We ordered a Canadian bacon, black olive and cheese pizza. There was also this ahi appetizer that caught our eye that we wanted to try as well.  The avo rolls were so-so. Deep fried avocado. Hmm..avocado doesn't NEED to be deep fried if you ask me. *scratches head* I guess I just didn't really get the concept. I know people in the States LOVE everything deep fried (County Fairs are evidence of that, I hear BUTTER is an option) but to me, it didn't really DO much to the avocado. There wasn't anything spectacular about it or any kind of fantastic flavor that really struck me.  The ahi was TERRIBLE. The tortilla (?) chips were so overcooked or fried or whatever, they tasted AWFUL. We didn't realize what it was because you're supposed to use the chips to dip into the chopped ahi. They were burnt and tasted horrible. We couldn't even continue to eat it. I tried to taste the ahi by itself, but again, it didn't taste like POKE or whatever it was TRYING to be. It was bland, had some soy sauce splashed on it, and was just simply disappointing.  The pizza was okay. I have to admit, it tasted a LOT better the next day when we ate it as leftovers. The sauce is really what convinces me when it comes to pizza. I had to order a side of marinara because I LOVE my pizza saucy! :) Well, it wasn't all that saucy, the crust was very soft and thick, but DEFINITELY not like a GENUINE Chicago Pizza Pie, actually pretty much NOTHING like a Chicago Pizza pie. Not even close.  The pizza was good enough to take home in the box, but NOT good enough to have us return to BJ's for the pizza. The ahi was terrible and pretty much determined my liking or disliking of BJ's.  Worst part is we were just over it and didn't even get a pazookie. I know. Blasphemy!

Yelp R.,"San Jose, CA",0,16,1,1.0,10/6/2012,"Triple jeopardy experience! Ageism, Classism, and Racism all in one at the BJ's on 2nd Street!  1. Even if you are over 18 years of age, you will be referred to as a boy or a girl by the manager. 2. You need 3/4 of your party to arrive on the dot in order to keep your RESERVED table. Why? Because traffic stops and parking spaces open for all BJ's customers in order for them all to be there on time for their reservation. If anyone from your party were to arrive later than ""on the dot,"" they will first be denied to order and then asked to leave your table by the manager (and rudely, if you are a minority) to go wait in line for another table because their part of the table will be taken away. And, this splitting of your party only happens if you're lucky and they feel like being generous. If not, they take away your whole table and thus, your RESERVATION. Now, all the people of your party who have arrived will have to wait until everyone arrives in order to wait in line to get a table even though you made a RESERVATION. 3. You have a limit of 2 hours for your party to be there eating at your reserved table but if they feel like kicking you out at least 30 minutes before your ""time is up,"" even if you're a paying customer, and you have a full table, not everyone at your party will get to eat because the manager says so. 4.

My most recent encounter with the incompetent staff was just tonight, I called to order a pizza (one that could not be placed online since it was a special order 50/50) and they put me on hold, only to forget that I was on the line. I waited 5 minutes and called again, same guy answered and seemed shocked that I would call back and was confused. He said ""Wait., you actually want to order that? Didn't you already place your order?"" I told him how he forgot I was on hold and he said ""I won't forget about you this time."" Well he was a horrible liar because again I found myself on hold for 5 minutes. I hung up and now I'm not even hungry. 2. The food is okay, you have to know what to order. Stick to the pizza. If it sounds like something you would get at CPK then avoid it because it is a failed attempt. I recommend the Buffalo Chicken pizza with no celery. 3. It is severely overpriced. $20 or more just for a medium pizza. I only paid it once in a while because I am super hungry and don't want to waste my money on Domino's (eek.)  If you like deep dish pizza and can order online for take out, go for it. Otherwise you are best off going to California Pizza Kitchen on PCH and 2nd, which is a personal favorite of mine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-long-beach?start=60

They also have bottles of Redbridge (a mediocre gluten free beer) at $4.50 each, which wasn't too bad. It wasn't the best gluten free pizza I've had, but it was very tasty. It's nice to be able to go out and order a gluten free pizza and beer, not just have it at home.  My server told me that I was the first person she'd ever had who ordered the gluten free pizza.

We had to ask 6 times for someone to change the channel to the Ducks playoff game, mind you there were no other competing games on at that time.

We got an ahi appetizer that was slimy as hell, because we wanted something fresh. This wasn't it.  For our entrees I got fish and chips and he got the chicken parmesan, both of with tasted the same, and greasy. You could just tell that everything you were eating had been frozen.

The rest of the menu is pretty average.  I get the BBQ beef sandwich on occasion which is not bad.  My advice, stick to the beer, pizza, and appetizers and you'll leave satisfied.   If there's room, those Pizookies are damn addicting.  Try one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-long-beach?start=100
Kealoha V.,"Abilene, TX",1066,454,258,3.0,4/29/2008,"I've had ate at least three different locations, but from this one I have only had food delivered. Each of the three time that I had my food deliverd, my order has always made it to me in the time quoted, which is always something you would hope for when ordering out. With the exception of our most recent order, everything has been as we had asked for. They made the mistake of the type of salad that we wanted, but thankfully my girlfriend loves salads so it didn't cause too much of a problem. I would still order from them again. Now as far as their food is concerned. It's decent. I've tried their various sandwiches, pizzas, and of course their wings. I can't pass up trying a places hot wings. I still don't like the fact that they don't come already sauced, you must do that yourself, which isn't a bother, but still you would like it all done for you when you get your food. The wings themselves are fairly meaty, which is great of course. Their buffalo sauce isn't too bad either. I wish it was a little hotter, but I generally just add some Cholulua and I'm good. Their ranch is decent to. Together it's still better than what you get at other local restaurants.  Their pizzas are made in a deep dish style, which is something that I have never been a big fan of, but they still are enjoyable. I really like their Blackened Chicken pizza which comes with an Alfredo sauce instead of the more traditional tomato sauce. In addition it comes topped with roasted red peppers, green onions, corn and blackened chicken breast. I usually ask for no green onions on mine. Pretty good pizza if you ask me. Last time I ordered a Cheese & Tomato with roasted garlic and Blackened Chicken. Really good, had so much garlic on it.  Finally if you haven't had one before you should at least try it once and that is their pizookie. For those who have no clue what that is, it's a thick cookie topped with vanilla ice cream. You have your choice of chocolate, white chocolate macadamia nut, peanut butter or oatmeal raisin cookies. I personally love the peanut butter. I don't always order this, but it's nice to get everyone once and awhile. I wish I could speak for the location itself, but it's 2nd St, so I can't imagine it being the great of experiences eating at the restaurant itself.

The food wasn't all that great so one star off and I have to take out a star for the service at the time because the food took a long time and the server didnt really attend to our needs. The spaghetti my gf ordered lacked the marinara sauce but what looked like to be 90% oil and water with 10% being some sort of red sauce.  Bjs is always nice but I like the Cerritos location better for the vibe and its a much bigger place.  If you are on second street, dont make this your first choice but more over a last resort.

Krys G.,"Mission Viejo, CA",240,223,77,4.0,8/9/2007,"This is not the first place I think of when I want pizza, since the BJ's experience is totally different than the typical pizza joint.  Their pizzas are Chicago-style, and one piece can be an entire meal.  We usually choose to avoid their pre-determined pizzas (the white one, the all meat one, etc.) and order as we would a usual pizza with toppings such as green peppers, pepperoni, onions, etc.  I highly recommend that. The pizza comes out piping hot in its own deep dish pan and is covered in great sauce and cheese, but the main attraction for us is the crust (thick and perhaps a bit buttery?) and those fabulous stewed tomatoes on top.  I'm just drooling thinking about it. They have a decent collection of home-brewed beers as well.  I highly recommend the amber ale (if you're a Bass/Sam Adams/Stella drinker - an ale person) and oddly enough, their berry cider is fantastic as well. Very sweet and refreshing.  If you're off the alcohol when you go, they also have great traditional pink lemonade and rim the glass with sugar.  Yum-meh. It's often packed here, and it's not the easiest place to wait with only a few places up front (hence the 4/5,) but if you're feeling the need for the Chicago-style goodness, it's worth the wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-long-beach?start=100

Holly T.,"Philadelphia, PA",388,698,1217,3.0,7/8/2006,"Time to re-review this place, since my original review was one of my early ones and really didn't do this place justice.  By now, everyone is familiar with BJ's, and it has even entered the world of hated corporate chains. Well, it wasn't always like that. Back in the day, BJ's was just a local hole in the wall place, with locations in a couple SoCal beach towns. It started in 1978 in Santa Ana, and even in 1996 when the first brewery launched in Brea, there were only 7 locations along the coast, just simple little pizza joints, and this was one of them, which I was introduced to in the early 1990s. In college we just knew it as a place to get some pizza and pizookie, either here in LB, HB, or the now-closed Seal Beach location. So this Long Beach location sort of represents what BJ's used to be. If you're used to the newer, big, huge fancy BJ's, this place will probably come across as a dump. They have put in some new plasma screens, but other than that it's not too fancy, it's pretty small, and it hasn't changed much over the years. It doesn't even have a bar, though of course you can order BJ's signature beers here. Since the beers aren't brewed on premises, though, the quality suffers slightly, and they rarely feature any special brews (stop trying to pass off Nutty Brewnette as a special! It's on the regular menu at other BJ's!). (By way of contrast, the brewer at the BJ's in Chandler AZ comes up with some amazing seasonal brews that win awards at local brewing competitions. There is nothing special going on with the beers at this location, though.)  I like the pizza here, but even more than the deep dish, I really like their thin crust appetizer pizzas. If you don't like thick crust, you really should check these out. Also, I really like several of their salads. It's probably the only place I would ever consider ordering a salad as a meal, since I am really not a salad person, but these are really filling. Their beer... I used to really like it. It's still a million times better than the macrobrewed junk you get at other bars, and it's better than a lot of the local microbrews as well (BBC, for example). Their Jeremiah Red, Porter, Imperial Stout, and Hefeweizen are all good, reliable brews. You can get sampler sets for a very reasonable price. I wouldn't place these among the great beers of the world, but for Long Beach, you won't find much better. I do NOT recommend this place for pizza delivery, though; the wait is far too long to make it worthwhile.  Service here is usually pretty decent, and since it's open until 11pm on weeknights and midnight on weekends, it's one of LB's few dining options after 9:00pm, so cheers to that. If you're looking for a bigger, fancier BJ's, the closest one is in Cerritos.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-long-beach?start=120

Davidius F.,"Long Beach, CA",4,17,6,2.0,6/3/2008,"Et Tu Bj's? Alright... it breaks my heart to do this, but I have to give Bj's a score of 2 stars. I *want* to give Bj's a better score because they have totally awesome pizookies (really big freshly baked cookies topped with ice cream) which one can combine with some decent coffee to make an excellent desert. I have to say here that Bj's is one of the only restaurants on Belmont shore that has decent coffee that isn't a coffee shop. I have had dinner here perhaps on 8 - 10 different occasions over a 2 year period. On one such occasion, my girlfriend and I were dining, and noticed that a bunch of fratboys at the table across from us were being pretty rowdy. Hey it's all good, we're all here to have a good time right? Well, after the frat boys were being rowdy for an especially long time, my girlfriend and I began to notice that  the ruckus wasn't just with the frat boys but with some of the other patrons as well. But, again, as long as everyone is having a good time right...RIGHT?? Wrong. We realized what was going on while walking out of the restaurant (after a lovely meal, minus the over all commotion, etc...) because a very large (but innocent looking) RAT jumped out of one of the booths in front of us!!! What transpired next was like something I've never seen in a restaurant. A busboy ran after the rat in between tables and patrons with a plastic lid of some kind, THROWING it at the rat trying (in vain) to trap it underneath, all the while also apologizing to the customers, and trying to keep things calm. It would have been sooo hilarious, if you know... I hadn't just eaten. Believe it or not, I gave Bj's the benefit of the doubt, and have returned since to eat there again. I've worked in the restaurant business for a long time and know that exceptions happen.  However, I ordered a pizza (half artichoke half BBQ) at around 9:30pm, because I go into work for the overnight shift and wanted something to eat before work (it's the equivalent of breakfast for me). Anyhow, I don't know if it was because the were getting ready to close the kitchen or what, but on my way to work my girlfriend opened up the pizza box, and inside were some of the toppings *underneath* the pizza. The resulting scenario was the soggy bottom to a pizza box that got on my girlfriends pants and part of her shirt. And the piece de resistance? It wasn't cooked all the way through.   So sorry to say, but 2 mistakes of this caliber out of our 10 visits isn't a very good record, and my poor tummy can't take this kind of punishment - especially not for the $30 I paid ($25 pizza + $5 tip). I wanted it to work out, I really did. I'll always think of your yummy honey mustard chicken salad, the great pizookies and coffee, and we can still be friends right?

Rocio S.,"Long Beach, CA",0,28,,2.0,10/9/2010,"I love BJ's Restaurant and have been to my fair share of different locations here in SoCal and in NorCal, but this one really needs to step it up in the customer service dept. One of the first times I came here with a friend, there wasn't a hostess in the front to greet us and it was a little busy so it was understandable. So we sat down on the bench. We were waiting for about 5 mins, then the hostess came back to her post, gave us one look, and completely ignored us. We thought maybe she's a little busy right now and she'll talk to us when she's ready to take us in. She was only there for about 2 mins then left. So we waited a little longer, then a group of 3 walked in, waited along with us. The hostess came back 30 seconds after they walked in, greeted them and immediately sat them. The group looked at us as if not knowing if we were waiting to be seated or just sitting there like dumbasses. After this, we left. Being ignored twice when we really wanted to come eat here was really unacceptable and I wasn't going to give my money to a place that doesn't give a damn about their customers.  Another time I came here, was with 2 different friends. They really wanted to come eat here, but I was a little if-y from my first experience. We were greeted and customer service on the hostess and servers part was ehh mediocre, nothing special whatsoever. They brought out waters and we ordered beer, but when he brought them out he forgot mine. I thought he was going to go back to and bring mine but after 10-15 mins of him not showing up I had to order again. First of all, it wasn't even that busy for him to forget that. We were pretty hungry, so we ordered salads, spring rolls for appetizers, and pizza of course! Our salads were brought out immediately. Then we waited, and waited, and waited, and waited and no appetizer. I know it takes awhile to make pizza but that's why we wanted appetizers while we waited for the pizza. So after a VERY long wait (and I'm not exaggerating it was like 20 mins) our pizza came out. Hmm, that's strange. Isn't the appetizer suppose to come out before the main dish? So my loud friend makes a comment about how funny that the pizza came out before the appetizer. Then the server all of a sudden realized that we had also put in an order for spring rolls. This experience was just as crappy as the first one and I didn't even eat there the first time! Let's just say he didn't get a very good tip and he didn't treat us very well either. He kept ignoring us, forgetting our orders, it was just all a mess. I really like BJ's and other locations I've been to, but this one just does not deliver whatsoever. If you're big on customer service like me, go to a different BJ's that actually cares about their customers and you'll enjoy your meal a lot more. But if you're just hungry, then go ahead, come to this one. Just don't get mad when they screw up your order or forget things.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-long-beach?start=140

Suze Q.,"Long Beach, CA",1,76,2,3.0,8/13/2011,"While it's true that this location is much smaller and lacking a bar, I still enjoyed my visit. Our server was very nice and quick with our drinks and order. As a matter of fact, all the employees were very helpful, getting us refills when our server was busy and serving us our pizza. We had the Mediterranean pizza (no chicken!) and it was really yummy. It has sundried tomatoes, kalamata olives, feta and pepperoncinis. I noticed that they've updated the menu since I was last here (which was, like, 3 years ago). They've added some new items that sound really delish, like an ahi appetizer, gourmet mac and cheese, mini bruschetta and stuffed mushrooms etc....I wanted to try one of the new dishes but we came in with a craving for pizza and avocado egg rolls; guess we'll have to come back to try some new items. We also tried the new Red Velvet Pizookie; it was good, but not amazing. A little too sweet; I'll stick with the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut...mmmmmm.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-long-beach?start=140
Jennifer H.,"Lakewood, CA",11,257,20,2.0,11/17/2008,"This particular location of BJ's is quite odd.  Being located on 2nd Street, I assumed it would be complete with a full drink menu, but it is not!  On my last outing here, a friend ordered a martini, and was informed that they don't have a bar, so it's beer and wine only.  What's up with that?!  Another odd thing about this location is the setup of the dining area.  It's basically one square room that is overcrowded with tables.  There were a few TVs on, and the overall ambience was...hectic? Here's a rundown of my last visit: I called ahead to get a table while we were on the way there, and they were happy to oblige.  Our table was ready within a couple minutes of our arrival.  Although it looked strange in there, we were quite pleased with the quick seating on such a busy Saturday evening.  Unfortunately, the quick service ended there.  Our entire party of 6 was ready to order loooong before we got waited on.  We had to ask for water and place settings.  Once our order was taken, we waited for a long time.  We started noticing other tables that were seated long after ours getting their pizzas while we sat with empty water glasses.  Once the food arrived, my pizza was delicious.  For others, the food wasn't as great.  Two burgers were ordered well-done, and they arrived pink in the middle.  One of them was supposed to come with bacon and cheese, but it was plain.  RThis led to a manager coming to our table to apologize.  Rather than sending them back, the guys agreed to eat them as is, and asked not to be charged for the missing toppings on the burger.  The waiter said ""No worries.""  We finished dinner and had Pizookies, which were very good.  When the bill finally came, the waiter did not split it as he agreed to do at the very beginning.  In the end, one of the Pizookies was free, and the messed up burger was comped as well, but the experience was still not good. Other locations are quite spectacular compared to this one.  Go elsewhere if possible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-long-beach?start=140

Justin O.,"Palm Desert, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/30/2013,"Worst restaurant experience I've ever had.

Ordered appetizers which arrived cold..,  the section we were in I noticed there was one waitress helping all of the table around us but she never even tried to come help our table and she seemed like she was really chatty with the other tables so if she could hold a conversion with other table then she could take a few minutes to come help our table...In fact it seemed like she was avoiding our table. overall it took them an hour and 30 mins for them to bring our actual meal and when it arrived it was soggy and tasted worse than fast food. will never come back to this so called restaurant, because of the terrible service from that waitress.

WTF! you would think for $10 they would give you a good salad but NO... i would have been more satsified with a salad from jack in the box.. im so dissapointed in this bjs... they are usually known for their good portions and customer service.. i guess not this one :'(,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-long-beach?start=140

Julie B.,"Long Beach, CA",5,29,,2.0,11/11/2009,"I know that reviewing a huge chain restaurant like BJ's is kind of unnecessary as most people have been to one and if you've been to one, you know exactly what the food is going to taste like at all of them. But, this review is specifically of the 2nd Street location because it is remarkably...un-BJ's-ish. (It's my review, I can make up words if I wanna) I have been to BJ's in Burbank many, many times as it was my favorite place to watch Dodgers games when I lived in those parts. The food was never great but was usually good and it was more about the bar and the huge TVs and the big comfortable booths that easily fit 10 people.  The BJ's on 2nd street has none of those things. It's really strange to me that they chose to put this restaurant in that space because it just kind of doesn't work. It's tiny, there are hardly any booths and for a place that is marketed as a place to go drink beer and watch sports, there was no bar and very small TVs that were mounted waaay too high for their size.  We went there for dinner earlier tonight. When we arrived at 6:30 there were only a few tables that were occupied but no host at the front and we stood there, dumbly, waiting for someone to acknowledge us for a good 15 minutes. Several servers and bussers looked at us, knew we were there but didn't say anything to us. Finally, a delivery guy on his way out the door with an armload of pizzas came and pointed us to a table. The service was fine after that but it wasn't a good start. My mom got the appetizer Marguerita pizza which she enjoyed. I got the bacon sourdough burger with fries which was horrible. The fries were so greasy that liquid spurted out with every bite and coated my tongue with a disgusting film. The meat of the burger was fine but the bun, which was actually just thick, sourdough sandwich bread was heavily buttered to the point that even after pressing a napkin into it to soak up some of the grease it was almost wet feeling in my mouth. Paired with the fries, it was way too much for me (and I'm pretty tolerant of greasy, I did order a bacon cheeseburger) and I gave up after less than half of the burger and only a handful of fries.  Having abandoned my dinner, I ordered a white chocolate macadamia nut Pizookie because there is just no way to f$%# up gooey, barely baked warm cookie dough topped with vanilla ice cream. It made the trip worthwhile and earned the extra star.  I can see going back for the Pizookie and the beer but certainly not for the food or the atmosphere. One last word of advice, the seasonal Pumpkin Ale tastes pretty good, sweet with just a hint of spice, dark, nutty and smooth BUT it is only 4% alcohol by volume which is really quite low for beer. So, if you are planning to order a beer for the nice, warm, relaxing feeling that it usually gives- don't order this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-long-beach?start=140
Shannon J.,"Long Beach, CA",26,7,12,1.0,7/17/2009,"I have been a Belmont Shore resident for 4 years and I always support our local restaurants but this time I had 2 picky nephews with me that wanted BJ's. Against my better judgment I gave in and we went. Service was fine, food was typical chain restaurant blah. That night I paid with my fiance's  card and when I got home I realized I left it at the restaurant. I phoned ahead spoke with the manager and she told me to bring the card holders ID with me and I could pick up the card. When I returned to the restaurant the manager wouldn't give me the card quoting corporate policy that the owner had to come in person and get the card. I told her I spoke with her on the phone and she said I didn't know you would come.  I also told her the waitress could ID me that I left the card there. Talk about being made to feel like a criminal, the bill was $20 and she still  wouldn't return the card I had to go home and get my fiance even though I had called ahead to check. This is why you don't go to chain restaurants because they don't care. This would never have happened at one of my local restaurants because the owners take the time to get to know you and your family, and make you feel proud to live in such a family community.
