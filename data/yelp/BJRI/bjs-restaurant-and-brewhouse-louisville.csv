Sowmya K.,"Louisville, KY",0,7,10,5.0,6/21/2017,"Went to BJ's for the first time last week for dinner and was blown away by the variety in their menu. One of our friends suggested this place as we were not able to decide on what kind of food we'd like to have for our small gathering that night. They had something from every cuisine including pastas, burgers, tacos, jambalaya, noodles etc. Everything we ordered was quite delicious and tasted authentic to its cuisine. Another interesting thing is their price range is also quite flexible with anything from $7 to $20 and above on the menu. Definitely will come back and try something different every time until I've tried almost everything on their menu!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-louisville?start=20
Samantha D.,"Prospect, KY",65,100,116,4.0,12/22/2015,"We came here on a Monday night and I was surprised at how full it was! Definitely great ambiance!  We had the Root Beer Glazed Ribs which were AMAZING as well as California Club Flatbread Pizza which was good and the Santa Fe Spring Rolls which were okay.  For dessert we ordered the Pizookie Trio and it was delicious because we got to sample the Triple Chocolate Pizookie with Ghirardelli, the Salted Caramel Pizookie and the BJ's Peanut Butter S'mores Pizookie. I definitely recommend choosing the trio for dessert!  I had the Sangria and it was DELICIOUS! Service was good as well. I will definitely come back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-louisville?start=20
Larry B.,"Gatlinburg, TN",29,10,1,5.0,9/16/2017,Great experience! Food is always good and staff very friendly. A favorite spot to stop when you're hungry or just want to relax and have a drink. Yummmmm,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-louisville?start=20
Emily D.,"Louisville, KY",84,7,,5.0,8/13/2017,"My mom and I went here a few weeks ago and then came again last night. We love it. The food is delicious, The wait was minimal, and the service was good. The menu is a bit pricey, but it's huge, and we got out spending only $35 including tip. We both got drinks, two huge entrées, and salads. not bad!

Allison B.,"Suwanee, GA",2,56,,4.0,9/15/2017,Wonderful house brews and service.  Great place to watch games and eat.  The service was great!  Miss the regular nachos not a fan of the flatbread nachos but still good just not the same.  Their pizza is delicious!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-louisville?start=20
Sarah M.,"Lexington, KY",209,407,2016,4.0,3/25/2016,The menu is HUGE to say the least. We went for an evening out with some close friends. The Bloody Mary's  are on point and drinks are moderately priced. We kept it simple with the mozzarella sticks for starters and they didn't disappoint. The personal pizza was great as well. And of course you cannot forget the beer.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-louisville?start=20
Amy L.,"Germantown, Louisville, KY",559,318,254,4.0,3/12/2015,I am not usually a big fan of restaurants located in or around a mall but BJ' s is legit. I have been several times for cocktails and lunch once and dinner twice. Every time was consistant with food and service. The atmosphere isn't bad. It is a bit loud but not terrible.  My favorite night to go to BJ's is Tuesday- 1/2 price wine by the bottle or glass. Oh happy day! They have a nice wine list too. I had a salad with grilled salmon. Huge portion and good presentation. The menu has a ton of options- including vegetarian and low calorie/low fat dishes.  Next time you are shopping at Oxmoor Mall- stop by and check t out.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-louisville?start=20

Rebecca M.,"Vienna, VA",387,338,279,4.0,12/27/2015,"Fresh and delicious entree salads, California flatbread, and pizookies are just three little reasons BJs is on my ""go to"" list!   Despite being a chain restaurant, BJ's offers inspired and healthy creations made from quality fresh ingredients that keep bringing me back. I wouldn't be reaching so far if I suggested there is almost a mom and pop feel to many of their dishes!! Far more than a Friday's or Applebee's, this place offers consistent quality to their salads.  The roasted kale and brussels sprouts salad is my absolute favorite item on the menu, featuring lovely bits of tender chicken, crisp, piquant onion, salty pepita seeds, acidic and creamy goat cheese, sweet dried cranberries, and juicy purple grapes---all perfectly balanced with just the right amount of tangy dressing.  Then there's the twisted Blt with Bleu cheese, spinach, copious amounts of bacon and a tangy honey-Sriracha dressing. I get two and make it my entree (it's a side salad but you can make it a ""double"" upon request) It's truly a party in your mouth!  Next on my go to list is the succulent California flat bread with bites of chicken, bacon, and avocado on warm, thin crust.  If healthful, savory offerings are not enough to bring you to BJ's, the dessert menu could make any patron smile with sugary delight. My personal favorite is the peach cobbler with sweet succulent peaches topped with flaky, warm crust. A close second is the pizookie, BJ's version of a deep dish baked cookie served still warm and soft in the middle and topped with ice cream.  The salted caramel variety would tempt even the staunchest dieter with its creamy, crisp, chewy, warm, frozen, cakey and sugary goodness all together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-louisville?start=20
Ron A.,"Jeffersonville, IN",71,60,32,3.0,3/15/2017,"Nice interior for a restaurant attached to a mall. Busy but not too noisy. Hostesses were not welcoming but were seated quickly. Food was not good. My steak was tasteless. The root beer glazed boneless wings were inedible -- burnt tasting. Burger was tasteless, too. Signature dessert had a metallic taste. The mai mai was good, so there's that. The waitresses were good -- nice. Didn't charge us for the wings. Refills were slow in coming. Pricey for what we got. May need to try it again but order more wisely. Or drink a lot. They had plenty to choose from.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-louisville?start=20
Rick H.,"Louisville, KY",0,9,,5.0,9/25/2017,Went with my family tonight. They were running a special on half price large deep dish. I don't normally have deep dish but it was a great deal.

Morgan E.,"Louisville, KY",86,149,61,3.0,2/2/2015,"I wasn't impressed - which is unfortunate because I've been to a BJs in Orlando several times and I loved it. I think my biggest disappointment in this BJs wasn't the food but the service. I called several days ahead and asked if I could do a reservation for a party of 7 - I was told reservations are for parties of 8 and above and that I could do call ahead seating for 7. So, I did. Thirty minutes before arrival I called and was told I needed to make a reservation. I was insistent that I was told differently and after a minute or so she begrudgingly put my name on the list. When we arrived we waited for over thirty minutes (why did I call ahead?). A couple of people in our party didn't show so we were seated after the adjustment was made but it all seemed like such a chore.  The food was ok. The Tomato and Mozzarella Salad was very good. I got the Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps and there was a lot of good flavor but the shrimp was cold. I'm not sure if it was supposed to be or not. But I wish it had been hot or at least warm. The table service was fine - nothing spectacular but got the job done. I'll definitely be back - but I'll probably stick to the one in Orlando.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-louisville?start=20
Michael J.,"Louisville, KY",0,118,9,3.0,7/2/2016,"Food is great, BUT, $10.50 for a glass of the house wine? Come on!

Dawn M.,"Louisville, KY",29,14,2,5.0,4/4/2016,We planned a going away party for the GM of the restaurant that I work at last week. Amy set us up with a private room.

Cindy C.,"Louisville, KY",26,15,4,5.0,8/10/2017,"Every Thursday night my widowed mother and her children gather for dinner at various local restaurants. This week we chose BJ's for our party of 20. The reservation was made the morning of and we were each kindly greeted upon our arrival. Since the layout of the seating was one long thin table, a request was made to rearrange the tables where we could talk easier among the large group. They quickly accommodated that request as well. That was just the beginning of a perfect night. We had two waitresses that took our orders, delivered them promptly and courteously, took our dinner orders which came extremely quickly, all while serving every needy request of our large group. Out of the 20 of us there was not a single complaint about our food, service or the amount of time it took to get our orders. This is our fourth trip to BJ's as a group (I go more regularly) and I can tell you not a single one before was any different than this trip. They are a Class Act, reasonably priced and an exceptional place to gather whether your party is a small one or a large one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-louisville?start=20
Kelly Y.,"Louisville, KY",88,290,1046,4.0,3/10/2012,"I hate the name; but love this place. What else can I say?  The marketing geniuses of this place summed it up in those two letters.  They accomplished the best a chain can:  cavernous, comfortale space; convenient location; big TVs; great drinks; giant menu offering quality and quantity of food...plus great service! I found the best turkey burger here!  It contains all of the stuff I love on a burger, none of the crap I usually have to pull out of other burgers.  Large, juicy turkey patty topped with melted Swiss, sautéed mushrooms, fresh(not previously frozen!) avocado slices...all of that on a soft multi-grain bun.  Mmmmmmm....turkey burger!  I did not even miss the beef when I eat this.  The patty is more wide than thick, has a sizable circumference to make my favorite part of a burger:  the patty over bun overhang!  My meal was not for the calorie counting crowd.  It came with crispy thin fries and I dipped them in a side of mayo...yum!  I had to try their wings, too.  Meh...I've had better.  In fact, the only thing memorable about those wings is their tiny size.  I remember thinking it was not worth the long plate they were presented on and the price tag. And if you don't like beer like me, try the Wyder's Pear Cider!  So good and so not like a beer!   BJ's has longer hours than your usual suburban place.  We finally found a place to go past 9PM here in the suburbs! Arghhhh, that name...it makes it really awkward for me to take anyone there b/w the ages of 10 and 25yro...But it really is good enough for 5 stars!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-louisville?start=60
Ryan L.,"Louisville, KY",38,12,1,5.0,7/18/2015,"I'm usually reluctant to sit in a restaurant's bar area because I think the service has a higher risk of being terrible. This was not the case at BJs. My service was excellent, even in the bar area. BJ's has a massive menu that allows even picky eaters to find something they'll enjoy. I had a mini Bacon Chicken Ranch pizza. It was phenomenal. The pizza is so good it's hard to believe they aren't seen as a pizzeria. My friend got the shrimp scampi, again, and claims it to be the best in Louisville. I did have a Caesar salad that I thought was just okay - nothing super impressive. We ordered drinks. I got a BJ's mojito and it was delicious - I ordered a second one of those :) Drinks were prepared and served super fast! Not the cheapest place. $70 for 3 alcoholic drinks, Side Caesar, mini pizza and shrimp scampi and the tip but the great food and great service make the extra money worth it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-louisville?start=60
Michelle C.,"Louisville, KY",145,133,215,4.0,8/30/2013,"My husband thinks that I'm pregnant, and after ordering a turkey burger and clam chowder I'm starting to think he's right. *runs and takes pregnancy test* Thank goodness, it's negative. But my combination of foods was pretty odd, however extremely satisfying. I wasn't feeling well tonight so the hubs offered to pick up some dinner here. I had a hard time deciding since their menu has a lot to offer but settled on the turkey burger and clam chowder. He left at 7 and didn't get back until 8:30, granted it was a Friday night and he could have sat at the bar and had a few beers, but j feel like it was a long time.  The turkey burger was pretty ok, good taste but didn't come with anything on it except lettuce (which was limp and I could have done without it) and cheese. Now the clam chowder (odd choice I know, especially since it's 90s outside) was delicious. Chunks of clams and potatoes, good seasoning, totally getting this again in the winter. Over all the food was good, and slow service might just be a husband error. I'd eat here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-louisville?start=60
Heather D.,"Louisville, KY",70,108,115,4.0,3/13/2015,"Oh chain-y chain restaurants. Here we are again. I don't really like to review them because if you've been at one, you've been at them all. I realize BJ's is a chain but I have to give this one credit: they do their cookin' right. Decor is pretty standard for a higher quality chain. Nice tables and booths. A prominent bar area. They have an entrance from inside the mall and from the outside. Hostess area is usually ""manned"" near the outside entrance. You know what's cool about this place? Gluten-free options. Yeah, yeah I know, you're sick of hearing that term -- but some of us have inflammatory stomach diseases. So here it is again. GLUTEN-FREE. PIZZA. The best part? It tastes awesome and is cooked well. Also: the gluten-free skillet cookie/ ice cream dessert is to die for. In fact, I think I know where I'm going to eat tomorrow. To my Sweet-tea connoisseurs -- the tea here will not disappoint! It's got a decent fresh-brewed taste and it's pretty reliable from visit to visit. I haven't really ever had a bad meal here. My only problem? - 1 star for unpredictable service! Ouch! I've had some loooong wait times just to get a howdy-do for a beverage before. We almost walked out a couple of times. Be prepared to wait and for possible lackluster service if you come near dinner time.

Luke S.,"Louisville, KY",16,5,,4.0,3/23/2016,"I love this place. It's one my favorite places for pizza in town so far plus their selection of house beers is awesome. Growlers! Great atmosphere too. The only downside is that they are always packed so expect a wait of usually at least 20 minutes depending on time of day. The fact that it's at the Oxmoor Mall doesn't help either, but I'd say it's a bit more accessible than the St. Matthews mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-louisville?start=60
Ashley D.,"Louisville, KY",373,220,185,2.0,7/16/2015,"I have no problems with the food at BJ's. I actually really enjoy it, but the service is abysmal. I hate to write negative reviews, however it's sometimes unavoidable. I have been to BJ's a number of times with varying table sizes and at different occupancies. This week two other Yelp Elites and I went to BJ's for half price wine night after a workout class. It was very crowded. Our server came and asked if we knew what we wanted. At the time we just asked for waters. When she came back (after about 7 minutes) she brought waters and took our wine orders. It took forever for the wine to arrive and my water sat empty the whole time. Once we got the waters, we ordered our dinner. I asked if I could get one of the quinoa bowls listed on the menu without meat, since I am a vegetarian. She said I could, but they would charge me for the meat. I told her I did not want to pay for salmon or chicken if I wasn't eating it and she said she'd ask the kitchen and come back with an answer. It took about 10 minutes for her to come and tell me they would adjust the price of the quinoa bowl and serve it without meat. During that time she went to several other tables and checked on them, while I still had no water. The quinoa bowl was good and the wine was a great deal, but I will avoid going back to BJ's for a while because the service was so bad. I know it's hard to be a server because I've worked in restaurants and I know they were very busy that night, but it doesn't make up for the way she treated me like a nuisance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-louisville?start=60

Donna F.,"Louisville, KY",0,3,,2.0,8/12/2016,What a disappointment!  Service was poor. Our server was very slow in bringing sugar for tea and refills. I asked for ice which I never received. We ordered an appetizer we never received.  My daughters meal came very late. The server said someone else took it yet it was not taken off our bill. My husband and I each ordered a build your own pizza. They were awful. We each paid for 3 extra ingredients. We received mainly bread with chopped tomatoes and cheese. The ingredients we paid extra for were basically nonexistent. There were slices of pizza that didn't have any of the extras. All in all a great disappointment.

Daphne A.,"Lexington, KY",194,54,67,5.0,2/4/2014,"I normally wouldn't give a chain restaurant a 5 star rating, but I've just had such a good experience at this BJs.  Both when I was actively counting calories and most recently trying to go without gluten, BJs just happen to be able to accommodate me.  The restaurant has a versatile and lengthy menu, but seems to do it right. They carry gluten free pizza crust, gluten free beer, AND A GLUTEN FREE PIZOOKIE.  SAY WHAT!?!?!?!?  Yummo.  Not a lot of other options - but I'm seriously not going to complain. They also have house brewed root beer, cream soda, blackcherry soda, and one other one (sorry its escaping me).   I think BJs will please the whole family and give you that quality you're looking for without inflated prices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-louisville?start=60

When we walked in, the hostess asked us how many, and we told her two. She then directed us to stand by a sign about five feet away while she collected the menus. I thought that was odd and felt more like a child lining up for recess instead of waiting for someone to take me to my table. The server got our drink order pretty quickly but then took awhile to come back to the table to take our order. When she finally did, she promptly put it in the computer. Our food came out quickly and everything was right. The only problem was the our server didn't check on us until we were almost done. We needed some napkins and water and it would have been nice if she was more attentive. The food was excellent. My wife got the Mediterranean Chicken Tacos and I got the Pesto Chicken Sandwich.

The menu is expansive, much like a Cheesecake Factory type menu, and the price per plate is under $12 (generally) which is nice. The parmesan crusted chicken with mashed potatoes is by far my favorite dish. Very filling and a great combination of flavors with the chicken, lemon, and broccoli. I've also tried the Barbeque Bison burger on their enLIGHTened menu and it actually gave the parmesan crusted chicken a run for its money.

So I ordered it.  My Black and Tan arrived and it was not floated just mixed together.  I pointed this out and the waiter said it just mixes that way.   ok...    We ordered the Frito Nachos as an app.  I ordered the lunch special with a Flatbread pizza and the salad. California Club and normal vinaigrette salad. My fiancé ordered the pasta lunch special with soup.  Spaghetti with clam chowder.   The Frito Nachos app was tasty but something we could easily make at home. The clam chowder was surprisingly good for a non seafood style restaurant.  Our waiter gained some points back from the beer confusion by bringing a box (as it was too much food for us)  and the check without asking.  Overall the food was good, service was polite and friendly, and the atmosphere was pleasant.  If I was in the mall and in the mood for a beer I would stop in again.  FYI - They have a military discount.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-louisville?start=80

Frances R.,"Louisville/Jefferson County, KY",0,12,10,4.0,8/11/2010,"Love this place! Shrimp skewers. Stir fry shrimp. Fish tacos. So far I have several wonderful experiences here.  My sister in law and I were looking for another lunch place when she spotted BJ's. Nice facade and the inside did not disappoint. Complete with televisions if you are interested in a game or five, a well spaced bar so no one is sitting on top of you, and a well presented menu complete with delicious choices and tasty alternatives.  New? The hostess will escort you to your seat and give you the rundown. Veteran, there is open seating and you can select wherever you wish. For my first choice I selected the Hawaiian skewers which consisted of delicately cut  red bell peppers, onions, pineapple, and very well selected shrimp that was flavorable and lightly seasoned. It was accompanied by sticky rice with sesame seeds. Yum! It was so good I had it yesterday and today! Get this! It was a 3.95 appetizer and seemed like it should have cost so much more! For my entree, I ordered shrimp stirfry. The teriyaki sauce really made this dish and the portion was enough to enjoy without hurting your wallet or your diet.  For today I had the fish tacos. Told that they were the waitress's favorite, I really looked forward to an awesome meal.

David A.,"Louisville, KY",3,51,,3.0,1/28/2014,"Sleek decor, extensive menu, and solid in-house beer list make this place an excellent drop in from time to time. You could sum up everything with 'pretty good'. There's nothing particularly awesome here but everything is pretty good. The highlight is the broad spectrum of selection from menu and everything is solid, not spectacular. The only real issue I had here...the service. Now, I'm rarely one to use service against a place. Having been a server for a long time, I know there are a lot of reasons a server can be busy and appear un-attentive. I am more forgiving of this than most. But on the most recent visit, the service was just plain bad. The restaurant was pretty busy, not packed, but busy. It took about 15 minutes to be greeted once we were at our table and then another 15 minutes to get our water...I don't remember how long it took to get the beer but I think we had to set up a tent for the night and get it in the morning. The food, that didn't come for 3-5 days later I don't think.  I only knock this down to a 3 star, but for some people the service would have been a dealbreaker. So use this as a word of caution, if you are in a hurry on a Friday or Saturday night or you are just one of those people that is really particular about this sort of thing you might want to avoid BJ's Brewhouse except at some off-hour on a weekday. Because I sense that when they get even a little busy this place grinds to a halt.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-louisville?start=80

I can't even remember exactly what I had the other time -- but I've never left disappointed, so I know it wasn't anything to complain about. I not a beer drinker, but I always find myself studying the unique beer menu offered a BJ's. I pick a different one out for my boyfriend every time we go. Harvest Hefeweizen. Nutty Brewnette.

Kellyo O.,"Prospect, KY",201,512,1136,4.0,4/30/2013,"First off: the parmesan crusted chicken and it was FABULOUS! Fun place and good food. Went with my family and the first thing I noticed was that BJ's was right next to Dick's. Seriously? What genious planned that layout? Since I am really a 13 yr old boy underneath, I was chuckling pretty hard and trying not to let it show so I didn't get 80 questions from the kids. The only two bad points that I am going to point out to get out of the way is that my dad, who walks with a cane, thought the floor was wet and about had a panic attack walking out of the revolving door. (PS - DO NOT let your kids follow your father through the revolving door. While he is holding the door for stability as he is testing the floor with his cane to see if it is drenched with water the youngin's will PUSH with all their might to make that door keep revolving. Bad things can happen and as funny as it looks from the outside - sorta like a Three Stooges comedy routine - it is not funny when you find out the back story.) Anyway, after making it past the incredibly WET LOOKING floor that is really just 100 gallons of shellac, you get to be seated in a gigantic room. Which brings up my second issue - try not to be seated under the big air blowers, they get kind of cold. On to the good stuff! Mom and I had the parmesan crusted chicken and it was FABULOUS! Hubby had the avacado egg rolls & he thought they were good and daughter had the calamari which she deemed ""pretty good"". She just eats calamari when we go out so she's had lots! My dad had the pot roast and potatoes which I am guessing were fantastic since they lasted about 5 seconds on his plate. I also ordered the Harvest Hefeweizen which I thought was tasty. I will be back to try some of their other brews.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-louisville?start=80

Lauren H.,"Louisville, KY",165,290,384,3.0,3/30/2016,"I rate the food at BJ's 4 stars, but the service here is so awful that it brings my rating down to 3 stars. I generally base my reviews almost entirely on the food and value, so the service has to be pretty bad for it to affect my rating. I've dined at BJ's many times, and the service has never been great, but last night it was horrendous. I arrived at 5:40 on a Tuesday afternoon. There was a respectable amount of other guests, but the place was not crowded by any means. After being seated, it took 15 minutes to be greeted. Unacceptable. I was with my BFF who had her newborn, so going elsewhere was not an option. We ordered and received our meals in a comparatively timely fashion. Our food and conversation kept us occupied so we didn't notice our missing waitress as much until it was time to pay. After requesting our checks, we waited 20 minutes to receive them. After placing our credit cards in the booklet (and leaving it open so she could see they were ready to be taken), we waited 20 minutes for them to be picked up. Ridiculous. There should be a 20-minute rule similar to when your college professor is late/no-show for class. If your server doesn't take your payment in 20 minutes, you're allowed to leave. I mean, come on, we're trying to give you our money here. After everything was said and done, we pulled out of the restaurant at 7:30. Almost two hours for dinner on a Tuesday afternoon. It took so long that instead of shopping afterwards like we had planned to do, we had to part ways so my friend could get home for her baby's bath time. From what I could tell, the problem is that they are understaffed/servers have too many tables.  One last complaint before I think positive thoughts... It really annoys me when restaurants feature happy hour prices that are available in the bar area only. Why should I have to pay full price when someone sitting 10 feet from me receives a discounted price? As a customer, it feels unfair. It discourages me from buying drinks more so than if there were no happy hour at all. I don't get a drink solely on principal. Either that, or I'll walk myself to the bar and order a drink. It's a pretty stupid policy that really grinds my gears. #rantover Now onto the positive. The food is actually really good, especially for a mall chain. As mentioned previously, I'd give the food 4 stars. The menu is large, and everything on it looks delicious. Everything I've tried has been above average. The ingredients are fresh and flavorful. BJ's also features an ""enlightened"" portion on their menu, with plenty of options under 675 calories. It's nice to have more than one or two options if you want to go the low-calorie route. I typically go with a large entrée salad for dinner, or a sandwich combo for lunch. Those are my go-to's, though I've tried plenty of other dishes and have been pleased with them all. Overall, BJ's is a good choice. Perfect for a leisurely day at the mall. If you're in a hurry or have somewhere to be though, be warned that BJ's could slow you down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-louisville?start=40

Wrong, the chicken she brought me was still salty. To make matters worse she never asked how the new piece was.  Needless to say not going to return with clients .

The menu is extensive with lots of yummy looking stuff on it. I ordered the bacon cheese burger with wedge fries (there are thin or wedge fries) and my daughter got the bacon ranch piadia with wedge fries. The fries were very good. The burger was cooked over a gas flame which was evident by the gas flavor through the whole burger. The fixings in the burger were fresh and generous.  The over all taste was however bland. The burger wanted to be good but it just did not make it.  A bit of seasoning may help. The homemade sodas are to kill for. I tried both the root beer and the cream soda.

We came here to grab a ""small"" bite and we were seated very quickly. We were in a booth and there was a puddle of something on the seats so I just decided to scoot over it. The guy who seated us apologized for it, but he didn't bother to clean it up! After scooting over it, I ended up sitting on a bunch of crumbs...I was wearing shorts, major bummer.   Then, we went on to order our food: avocado egg rolls, spinach stuffed mushrooms, mini-bruschetta and fish tacos. Maybe we just ordered the wrong things or maybe it was an off night. The avocado egg rolls weren't bad, but part of the wrap was chewy, not exactly the best texture to go with avocado! The mushrooms were stuffed with spinach artichoke dip, breadcrumbs and cheese; they were okay, but they were served warm, not hot. The fish tacos were just alright. The mini bruschetta was the biggest disappointment of the night; the bread was hard, I couldn't even get through one piece. Our waiter spoke to the manager who took it off our bill and offered to make it for us again. I appreciated it, but I had enough for the night.

Bathrooms very clean and not a bad place to wait while you're waiting to be seated (TV's everywhere). The beer selection is one of the best I think, never have I been disappointed with the choices and always great tasting.  Clearly they have stepped up their sevice/performance. They knew my little girls were hungry and brought out some fresh fruit and roll for them, without me even asking and at no charge...who else does that?!! That in itself makes for a great experience.

John H.,"Louisville, KY",5,104,,3.0,12/17/2017,Typical. Sat at the bar on Sunday night after Christmas shopping.  The bartender could not have been more cold and disinterested in waiting on me.  Not a good experience.   Avg beer selection - but my order came with a $1 off while I was there which was a nice surprise ($5 IPA after discount).  Ordered the Santa Fe Salad ($14).  It was better than I expected - flavorful and a fair amount of chicken.  I still haven't figured out why more places don't use a spring mix in a salad or spinach vs romaine.

The potato was served barely warmer than room temperature.  My wife ordered the chicken ranch Piadini with a side wedge salad. She also liked the wedge salad and mentioned it's small size.

Jessica G.,"Louisville, KY",211,62,22,4.0,11/12/2017,"I like BJ's, I've been twice before going twice this week and was always happy.   Friday Nov 10 I went in observance of Veterans Day with my cousin.   We sat in the bar area because the wait was really long and the bar area is huge so relatively quick turnover.  We were seated and for our drink order we wanted to use our reserve a beer vouchers for Vets.  The waitress (same name as mine) had no idea what we were talking about.  We also informed her that we were here for the Veterans Day deal.   She told us that it was good for up to 12.95 towards an entree.  Immediately after this discussion her service was far less attentive, cheerful and personable.  Granted the restaurant was busy, her service was awful.  I ordered the southern fried chicken and succotash.  I expected a variety of vegetables or at least some lima beans in it but apparently it's only corn and red pepper (the menu says this, I ordered in a haste to get my already unpleasant waitress away).  It was a rather uncolorful dish that I wasn't too impressed with.  I added a caesar salad  (lettuce, cheese, croutons, dressing) for 1.75.  So as my order came up to under $10 I was surprised to see that I still had a check for 1.89.  I was then informed that adding a salad was not a part of the ""entree"".  I wish I would have known to pick a more expensive entree :(  Needless to say this wasn't a good experience at all.  The next day I noticed they were still doing the promotion and I went back determined not to get on here and write an awful review.   This time I has the pleasure of being waited on by Ashley who was nothing short of amazing.  Her cheerfulness was maintained the entire service, she was attentive and checked up regularly.  She was knowledgable about the reserve a beer for a vet and thanked me for my service.  She was truly a breath of fresh air.  This time I ordered the Peruvian Quinoa with Blackened Shrimp and although the dish itself was relatively bland despite loads of great veggies, the shrimp was amazing.   Overall I would be back.  I would probably stick to more popular menu items instead of being adventurous and will always sit at the bar to avoid the wait whenever possible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-louisville
Kasen M.,"Brownsboro Zorn, Louisville, KY",172,105,2995,4.0,1/8/2017,"If you go to BJ's, sit at the bar and hope that Matthew is your bartender! After bumping into a friend at Oxmoor Mall, we went to BJ's for dinner. There was a 30 minute wait for a table, and it was really cold outside/by the door. We asked about sitting at the bar. They told us it wasn't reserved, so if we could find a seat we could take it. Luckily, as we approached two people were leaving. We swooped in and sat down. We were quickly greeted by a supercalifragilisticexpiali-friendly bartender. His name was Matthew. And he truly made our night incredible. He let us try samples of their beer. I knew that BJ's was a brewhouse, but I did not realize that they brew their own beers. In hindsight this does make sense. I had the Harvest Hefeweizen. It was super hella good!  And the fun didn't stop there, Matthew brought over a few samples of your own beer mixes. Some sweet brews mixed with a Porter and things like that -- just to be friendly.  My friend, Meghan ordered the calamari as we sat and sipped our beers.  It was a Friday, but I had Taco Tuesday on the mind. So when I saw that they had shrimp tacos on the menu it wasn't a hard decision.  I appreciated the menu had lots of pictures of the food. The menu itself is a tad overwhelming, it's a large book of options much like the book/menu at Cheesecake Factory.  Everything sounded delicious: pasta, flatbread, pizzas, burgers... But I wanted the tacos. So tacos I got.  The tacos came with a side of chips and avocado cream dip -- it was really good.   Meghan ordered the pasta, I didn't try any but her plate was totally cleared by the end of our evening so I'm going to assume she liked it.   Meghan's birthday just so happened to be the same week, so our random chance meeting at the mall turned into a ""hey, let's go celebrate your birthday dinner"".  We asked Matthew if they gave any sort of dessert for the birthdays. I'm pretty sure his answer was ""hell yeah!""  A couple minutes later a small cast iron serving dish with a fresh, chunky chip chocolate cookie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a lit candle arrived.  She loved it!  The desert and the extra touch of the candle really made her feel special. And she was kind enough to share with me, making me feel special too.  With it being her birthday and all, I wanted to treat her to dinner. She didn't know that I was planning to do this and was surprised when I said one check.  With the three beers, an appetizer, the shrimp tacos and the pasta fettuccine, the bill was just over $50.  When I checked-in on Yelp, I saw that there was a banner advertising buy $50 get $60. I decided to do this.  The banner on Yelp took me to BJ's website. When I added a $50 e-card to my cart and attempted to check it out, I noticed that it totaled $50, not $60. I was hesitant to buy through the website and not be able to use it so, I asked Matthew about it. He wasn't sure but he suggested that his manager was a pretty cool dude and I could talk with him.  The manager (I wish I could remember his name), was really nice. He said he thought that it would send me a separate $10 e-certificate, but he wasn't sure.  He also thought that maybe it was an old advertisement, like a Christmas special.  I told him that it was my understanding that a check-in offer or Yelp deal like this would be set up by that restaurant, not just something Yelp put out there without asking. I asked him if he would just take $10 off my check to make it easier on both of us. He agreed without hesitation and went over to the computer to input the change immediately.  I was really impressed by this customer service. He could have easily told me there was nothing he could do about it, but he didn't; and now I'm more likely to return to BJ's. I respect a business that follows through with what they promised. When I return I will want to sit at the bar to high-five my new friend Matthew and I'll try to time it during a happy hour so my bill is a little smaller. But, for an impromptu birthday celebration with one of my besties from High School, it could have been more awesome!  I honestly think Matthew was the difference maker for our visit. We came in having long, rough weeks and left 3 hours later with big smiles and a new friend.  Why the 4-stars versus 5: - the breading on the calamari was a little thin and soggy in a few spots. The red cocktail sauce was delicious, but there wasn't enough. (I feel confident that if we'd not been so busy catching up and asked for more sauce -- they would have brought more) - the Yelp Deal not working correctly through the app. Parent company - if you're going to advertise and have the offer on your website instead of through Yelp directly .. make sure the link works.  (And send your manager a thank you for being such a great guy and following through on that promise) :)  -- his reaction could have been a dealbreaker. Integrity is really import to me; and your store manager has it!  Thank you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-louisville

I used to exclusively get pizza and not even look at the rest of the menu, until a friend introduced me to their parmesan encrusted chicken. My eyes were opened to amazing other options that they serve and I've never had a bad meal yet. The most appealing part however, is the homemade sodas. Homemade rootbeers, and drinks that are made from their homemade rootbeers are my favorite. But the black cherry is also delicious. Actually they all are, I'm not biased.

Wife had the chopped chicken salad - a huge salad that we sometime share.  It was a little overdressed for my taste, but it is a huge salad with a sweet dressing that is addictive.  See couldn't finish it.  She went for the house Porter, her favorite beer there.

I've never been to a BJ's before and was happy at the diversity of the menu. It reminds me quite a bit of the menu you see at the Cheesecake Factory - just that they traded the cheesecake in for beer. Lots of really interesting things you can find there. The one complaint I have is that the service was not good. Perhaps is was the fact that I was there with a couple friends and their two kids, but the waiter largely ignored  us.

So what I like about their menu is that they have an extensive drink menu. Especially beer. I'm not a huge beer fan, but I love their beer. They have seasonal beer that they brew on their own, and it's delicious. I remember going to BJs during Halloween season and having a pumpkin flavored beer. It was yummy. Last time I was here, I got their berry cider. SOOO PRETTY and SOOO YUMMY!!!! Come here during lunch time. The pint of berry cider was only $3.50. I wanna go back to have some beer on my own right now just thinking about it. The staff at this particular BJ are all very nice and attentive. I've never encountered anyone rude. So on to their food. I don't get anything but their deep dish pizza. So yum. Their crust is so nice, fluffy, and chewy. Kinda reminds me of how Pizza Hut used to taste like 20 years ago... when they used to be good. hahaha. My only complaint is price. You can get pizza these days at one of the typical pizza joints like papa johns and dominos for less than $10. I got a medium sized 11"" pizza for around $20. It's a little pricey. I would def come back here for their drinks and food, but not as often as I would like because of their price. But you get what you pay for. Their pizza is delicious. So if you like chicago style deep dish pizza, come and try their pizza! Oh so they extended their menu and they now have the regular hand tossed pizza as well.

alicia v.,"Simpsonville, KY",22,33,,3.0,3/30/2011,"We always love BJs, we dine here often, its always consistent and good. This time, was not a great experience. Our server rushed us the entire time, he brought boxes when we were still eating, brought the bill before the dessert came. It was very frustrating, especially since it was nowhere near closing time.

James G.,"Centerville, OH",29,183,,5.0,6/9/2013,"If you come through the entrance from inside the mall, you're led through a long hallway that makes you think twice about eating here.  But then you turn the corner and you realize the main entrance is off the street, and the place is really nice.  As in fancy.  Prices to match.  But damn, the food and the beer are both awesome, and the service was exceptional too.  Wife got a little too excited for her French Dip sandwich, saying it was the best she's ever had.  Kid's chicken fingers were good too, and my Jalapeno Burger was spot-on.  The amber summer beer was smooth and so was the Blonde.  If you're looking for something a little more upscale, this is definitely a great place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-louisville?start=100
Derek C.,"Crestwood, KY",0,38,,4.0,9/6/2013,They have a large selection and food is great. I always get the jambalaya and it is wonderful. Service is normally good but not always.

Adam R.,"Chicago, IL",180,67,37,4.0,10/9/2010,"I dined there for my birthday meal. My brother and I shared the avocado egg rolls.  They are so unique and amazing.  A must order.  I had the lunch portion of a half sandwich and half wedge salad.  Surprisingly, the sandwich still came with the fries.  The sandwich was a California club with mozzarella cheese and avocados and a spicy mayonnaise.  My pops enjoyed his cal-zone.  My brother and mom both had the grilled cheese and tomato soup.  My brother commented that he would have preferred that the cheese be better melted. Although everyone was happy with the pizzooki.  I choose the white Macedonian nut cookie with vanilla bean ice cream.  The cookie was hot and gooey.  The ice cream melted nicely on top of the cookie.  Spoons were clanking against one another as everyone tried to sneak a bite in.   A great time",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-louisville?start=100

Shal V.,"Louisville, KY",32,192,47,5.0,8/19/2012,"Went to this unfortunately-named restaurant around 9pm last night for an impromptu date night after an evening of shopping at Oxmoor Mall. As soon as we walked in, I was struck by the ambience that melds a stylish design with a sports bar feel while not being kitschy in any way. They have a deceptively large seating area but tables are adequately spaced apart so you don't have to worry about inadvertently jabbing the person in the adjacent table in the eye with a fork or listen to some garrulous old crank bloviating about something (although in this case, you may feel the urge to wield your silverware as a weapon).  We started with the Chicken Wonton appetizer (Filled with marinated chicken and cream cheese, lightly battered and fried) - you can get them Buffalo or Thai style. We got the Buffalo-style, which means they serve it with Buffalo sauce and Ranch dressing. Muy delicioso!! My wife ordered the Grilled Burger Melt (a half-pound Angus burger, grilled to order, topped with cheddar & Swiss cheeses, caramelized onions and BJ's special burger sauce on grilled sourdough bread) - she loved it. I had the utterly scrumptious Black and Blue Burger (1/2 pound blackened Angus patty with a melted creamy bleu cheese topping, crispy Applewood smoked bacon, roasted garlic aioli and tomatoes), which was easily one of the best burgers I've eaten in eons!! I can't stop raving about it - cooked and seasoned to perfection, with the delightfully succulent combination of blue cheese and garlic aioli perfectly complementing the flavor.  Samantha's service was exceptional too! She was prompt, friendly, had an exuberance that was charmingly infectious, and she was candid when giving us her recommendations. As I've stated in previous reviews, I try to avoid chain restaurants as much as I can but our dining experience at BJ's on Saturday night was stellar!! Every time I'm at Oxmoor Mall, it will be hard to resist the enticing siren call of BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-louisville?start=100
Sarah W.,"Ypsilanti, MI",99,263,,3.0,10/10/2010,"I would definitely like BJ's more if it weren't in the mall.  Or, kind of in the mall.  Near the mall? You can't actually access the mall from the restaurant, you just have to concede all of the good parking spaces to people headed to Macy's. That said, they serve pretty good beer.  If you like beer, you should check it out.  Bearing in mind that it is a chain and they don't actually brew the beer on site, the beer that they truck in is quite tasty. I haven't tried their real food, but the apps are decent.  I thought the chicken lettuce wraps were a little too sweet for my tastes, but that didn't stop me from finishing them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-louisville?start=100
Keegan B.,"New Albany, IN",49,90,119,4.0,6/11/2012,"Draft Root Beer! The draft root beer and cream sodas alone have made this a place I feel compiled to come here. I finally got to try the Irish root beer I kept meaning too try. It's like dessert in a glass. Draft root beer, Jameson, irish cream and butterscotch. The small plate's portion of the menu is good if you want a light lunch or to sample different dish I recommend the mac and cheese. The draft sodas have no corn syrup on them. The food here is good and the drinks are phenomenal.

Brittany V.,"Calabasas, CA",2,13,2,3.0,1/3/2012,"I've had good experiences and bad. on the good side: I always brought out of town guests here. There something for everyone, and the food is dependable and enjoyable. My go to food choice is the Santa Fe salad with salmon. There's one steady server named Priscilla that's an excellent server. She works up by the bar if you can have a preference. on the bad side: the turnover is very high. It seems like there a new, inexperienced person struggling through their first day every time we step in. Carry out can be a blunder. After driving back twice with messed up orders, I had to be ""that guy"" and check the bags of food before payment after that. The micro-brew is well done, but never went there for just a beer. If you're not a Bro-skulling Cardinal or UK aligent, you'll start planning your dinners and drinks away from there when there are hot basketball games going on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-louisville?start=120

Adam C.,"Louisville, KY",84,440,,3.0,7/7/2013,"Good sports bar, but food is not as good as it should be. Inconsistent food left me with mixed feelings about BJ's. Once I had the best cobb salad I have ever had, next time it was completely different and not worth eating. Burgers were overly greasy. Yes I agree a greasy burger can be amazing, but there is a limit to greasy. When you realize it is greasy and hear yourself getting fatter, that's too greasy. I actually didn't finish my burger because I knew it must be horribly bad for me and it wasn't amazing enough as far as flavor to be worth it. Great place for larger parties. Hand crafted beers that can get a little expensive since they are just ok. They do have some lighter options on the menu, so you can eat relatively healthy here if you want. The lighter options are pretty good too, so don't over look them . Menu is similar to Cheesecake Factory in that it is very extensive and actually has the same feel. Apparently some of upper management from Cheesecake Factory now work at BJ's, so this explains the same feel from both places. They do have late night happy hour, but it is not as good as others in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-louisville?start=120

Jaime H.,"Louisville, KY",0,23,1,2.0,2/15/2013,"I think the food is good, but they charge $4.50 for a bottle of Coors Light. Ridiculous. I should have looked at the beer list for prices, but never considered a domestic bottled beer would be that much. The Santa Fe salad is normally a little over $11, but I substituted the chicken with salmon.

Sarah H.,"Louisville, KY",127,224,102,3.0,8/3/2013,I have been to Bj's twice now. My biggest complaint is the size of their menu. Restaurants that seem to do everything rarely do anything well. I think their pizzas are what they really specialize in and having tried both the deep dish and thin crust I will say that they are pretty good. The other food however while not bad is nothing outstanding. It's about what you might expect from any chain restaurant. As far as the pizza goes I recommend the deep dish. It's bready and cheesy and delicious. The thin crust was good as well ( I had the buffalo chicken pizza) but part of my crust had gotten pretty soggy by the time I tried to eat it. In fact two slices fell right apart when I picked them up. The buffalo chicken topping was good and pretty spicy. I think it would be better with either crumbled blue cheese or blue cheese dressing drizzled over the top instead of ranch. I think if they scaled down the size of their menu and focused mainly on their pizzas and a few other options this could definitely be a more frequent dinner spot for me.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-louisville?start=120

Jennifer S.,"O'Fallon, IL",23,24,,5.0,8/2/2014,"My husband, two children, and I were staying in Louisville for a couple nights on our way to Maryland. We got into our hotel and looked for a nearby restaurant that we could grab some takeout from to bring back since we had been driving a good portion of the day. We decided on BJ's restaurant, which was about 10 minutes from our hotel. My husband called and ordered the Scampi Pasta and Parmesan Crusted Chicken, which we split so we could both have a little bit of each. We also ordered the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms and Santa Fe Spring Rolls for appetizers. Both our kids had the Macaroni and Cheese Kid's Meals. My husband said when he went to pick the food up, everyone there was very helpful and even offered to get him extra utensils and napkins since we were staying at a hotel. When he got back with the food, I couldn't believe the portions; they were huge! The Scampi Pasta and Parmesan Crusted Chicken were both excellent, as well as the White Cheddar Mashed Potatoes that came as a side with the chicken. The appetizers were delicious as well. I particularly liked the spring rolls with the avocado cream sauce. In all, it was a delicious and filling meal, and it was reasonably priced for a family of four and as much food as we received.
