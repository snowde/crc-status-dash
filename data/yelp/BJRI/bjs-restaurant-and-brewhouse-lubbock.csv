Donna B.,"Albuquerque, NM",14,54,19,4.0,9/4/2017,In Lubbock for the evening. We had the jambalaya and it was excellent. It was recommended by the bartender. Good choice! The rolls were amazing! Nice house salad. My husband would have liked more dressing but I was good with how it was. . Good wine list and beer. We sat at the bar and Harley waited on us. She was excellent!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lubbock
Michael C.,"Lubbock, TX",142,275,346,3.0,8/27/2017,"Flat bread pizza with bacon, jalapenos, and pineapple: The spicy pig was great.  Especial with queso to dip the crust in.  Monkey bread with ice cream for desert to completely overwhelm my blood sugar.  Lots of menu choices and a well run kitchen.  Almost anyone should be able to find something they like on the menu.

Johanna K.,"Lubbock, TX",242,42,10,2.0,6/9/2017,"BJ's is one of those places I want to love, but the service and quality make it really difficult. The menu has much to offer, but unfortunately all the entrees I've had fell short. Even their ""famous"" pizookies fell flat for me.  Aside from the food being subpar the service is not great either. Multiple times that I've eaten here I've had very slow service, and also impolite service.  Go down just a bit and eat at Chuy's or Longhorn. Much better food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lubbock
Rob J.,"Odessa, TX",1223,346,130,2.0,9/2/2017,The two stars are for the waitress we had :) she was super cool. The drinks were good. The food had to be taken back twice. Which I hate Doug to waitresses. But a steak that was ordered medium well and came out rare them bid rare the second time switched my order to a burger which the manager said he would take care of. We paid it. He didn't take it off....smh... The baked ziti was really good tho...stay away from the steaks,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lubbock
Tim B.,"Lubbock, TX",36,10,2,4.0,2/13/2017,"Went here as a sorta Valentine's dinner with my wife (and toddler son). It was a Saturday night, and amazingly we snagged a short wait. The waiter did an average job. Nothing above or below board. My wife often likes to ask wait staff their opinions between two dishes before ordering. This waiter happened to be like me, and just doesn't like seafood, so he couldn't give a recommendation, and my wife went with a steak dish instead. I had the BBQ Bacon Brisket burger. I asked for a well done cook, and I got a medium well. Still good, but for a notorious texture eater, that is pushing it. I also replaced my fries with a fresh tomato and mozzarella salad. That was probably the best part of my meal. While I know it is a corporate mandate, they might want to think about removing the butter lettuce from the presentation. To me, butter lettuce is the second most useless eatable garnish. Hopefully the waiter we had will think about when some asks for a drink to go and a to go box, he might want to go ahead and bring the check next time as well. Common sense to me, but who knows, he might have needed that one spelled out. Happens.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lubbock

Tara B.,"Lubbock, TX",73,247,131,3.0,2/14/2017,"We came here Saturday night. We only had to wait about 10 minutes. I was on the fence between the steak and seafood tacos. The waiter (never got his name) said he didn't like seafood, so he couldn't offer his opinion. I went ahead with the steak, ordered medium. I should have gone with the tacos. There was seasoning on the outside of the steak, it was almost well done, and very dry. I would have asked for A1 but he didn't come back. The mashed potatoes were good and the Caesar salad was excellent. Would I go back? Yes, but I wont order the steak. Bleh.

Shimmy G.,"Lubbock, TX",26,70,164,4.0,7/9/2017,"I don't usually eat at chain restaurants, but when I do, it's BJ's. I first fell in love with BJ's when I lived in Gainesville, FL. So I was quite happy when I discovered that Lubbock had one as well. (Clearly I don't get out much.) Authenticity and consistency are the most important components of any brand and based on a culmination of all of my visits, the brand of BJ's would be great service, great place to watch the game, good beer, and good food. And the BJ's in Lubbock stays true to that. It started with the bartender who was great and the quality of food that we have come to expect. We got to watch a University of Florida softball game on the big screen per request and then came back the next day to watch the NBA Finals. I like the fact that I can get brussel sprouts as an appetizer and a delicious ahi tuna salad at a chain restaurant. I know every place has their ""healthy choices"" menu but for some reason, I just feel like it's actually health-IER at BJ's than at an Applebees or Chilis. (Oh my goodness, that sounded really snobby.) There are a lot of great independently owned restaurants in Lubbock but if you feel the need for something comfortable, I'm pretty sure BJ's will welcome you with open arms.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lubbock

I've been here two times, the first time I went was when it first opened and the second time was against my will with friends.  First, the big lie that they don't tell you up front is that the beer is made nowhere near here.  GO TO JJJ's INSTEAD IF YOU WANT THAT.  Second, the menu is ridiculously priced.   Last, the food blows.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lubbock
Jessica S.,"League City, TX",7,46,6,4.0,5/5/2017,"I have been to this location twice and both times were with a large group. The first time I went was for a bachelorette party. We made reservations ahead of time and were seated quickly. The menu has a variety of delicious looking entrées that makes it very hard to choose from. After much debate, I decided to get a flatbread pizza. The pizza was very delicious! The crust was thin and crispy the way I like it! A few of the other girls in my group got the deep dish pizza. Personally, I would recommend their pizzas because there is a different type of pizza for everyones' taste buds;however, they are a bit pricy in my opinion. The second time I went was for a birthday party. This time we didn't have a reservation so we had to wait about an hour until the big table they were planning to seat us at opened up. While we waited, we got drinks at the bar. My friend and I got the Irish root beer, first time to try this for the both of us. We both enjoyed it, you can definitely taste the root beer with a slight hint of alcohol, which is how I like my drinks! It was definitely a little pricy, but it was a big glass! As for food, I was debating between the bison burger (recommended by my friend) and the BJ's Brewhouse Burger. I went with the BJ's Brewhouse Burger and it was a great choice! The burger was bigger than my hand and half of my plate was filled up with French fries! The price for the burger was reasonable given my serving size. I think the service here is great. We were greeted as soon as we walked in both times and were seated as quickly as possible. The waiters were personable and attentive to our needs. The environment is very relaxing and intimate. I would definitely come back here for another special occasion!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lubbock
Brennan M.,"Lubbock, TX",67,15,3,1.0,9/4/2016,"My boyfriend and I came here since I'd never been before and he'd been to one back in Dallas. The service was somewhere near terrible. I've worked in a similar style restaurant and to me it felt like it was everyone's first day, I even heard the staff arguing. The food took too long to come out and my fries were cold and I got Pickens even though I asked for none. I'll probably never come to BJs again, especially not this one.  Update: it also ended up making both of us very sick.

C V.,"Weatherford, TX",0,2,,1.0,10/21/2016,"Being from out of town and looking for a place with a decent-sized menu, I decided on BJ's. I have been to the BJ's in Dallas and Corpus, and have had some pretty fair meals and service at them. That was not my experience in Lubbock tonight. To begin, the hostess was not friendly at all, and acted like she really didn't even want to be there. It was a chore asking me a few questions and handing me a pager. Seating and the initial encounter with the server were standard, not much different than anywhere else. I ordered an appetizer (ahi poke) and an entree (chargrilled mahi mahi tacos), along with a glass of water and an Oktoberfest beer, recommended by the server.  The water and beer were fine. Even though I ordered the ahi as an appetizer, it was almost immediately followed by the entree; I'm talking maybe a minute--I hadn't even had time to try the ahi yet. Unfortunately, the ahi was borderline inedible; while red, the texture & mouth-feel were just off, and there was a slight fishy taste. Either it was previously frozen and/or was on the verge of turning bad. I am still hoping I don't get sick... The two mahi tacos were not any better. There was hardly any mahi at all, and it certainly was not chargrilled. No marks, no charred flavor, nothing. In fact, the mahi had absolutely no flavor whatsoever. One of the pieces of fish in one of the tacos was completely inedible, sort of a fatty/rubbery gristle. Both tacos were cold--not room temperature, not lukewarm, but cold. Both tortillas were hard as a rock; in fact, I ate what little I could out of them with a fork and set the tortillas, which looked like rigor mortis had set in, aside on my ahi plate. During the meal, my server, in passing, asked if I needed anything (I didn't),but never asked how the meal was, or whether there was anything wrong with the meal, as I am sure she saw the tortillas discarded like the cardboard they were. Maybe she already knew enough not to ask... At that point, I just wanted to get away from the environment that was making me very frustrated, as I had eaten very little all day and I had been looking forward to a decent supper. However, the server who had been around when she wasn't needed was no longer anywhere to be found. When she did pass by, I asked for the check. She returned fairly quickly but, while I had my credit card in hand ready to immediately give it to her, she, without breaking stride, set it down on the table and continued walking. Even more frustrated, I jumped up, went to the hostess counter, and asked where I could pay. I was told I needed to pay my server. I started to explain when my server walked up and set down whatever it was she had in her hands. I followed her to the register, paid, and then got the hell out of there as fast as I could. Needless to say, I will not be going back to that location again. I was really hoping that, because of their menu, it might be a go-to place when you're not sure what you want or you're with a group and everyone wants something different--pizza, burger, pasta, fish, etc. While the menu does not begin to rival say Cheesecake Factory, it does offer a variety not typically found in many Lubbock restaurants. And while I am from out of town, I do come to Lubbock with some regularity. Of course, it may not have helped that I had just flown in from the Northeast and, having been in an environment where the food industry is not just a job but in many cases a career, and people in general demand a certain level of attentiveness and service in exchange for their hard-earned money, perhaps BJ's was already at a disadvantage. I recommend you save your hard-earned money and spend it somewhere other than BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse in Lubbock.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lubbock
Chris C.,"Lubbock, TX",14,4,3,1.0,8/6/2016,"Been a while since my fiancé and I have been to BJs, so with it being late we decided ""Hey, let's grab a big chicken Caesar salad and a chicken club sandwich"" since we didn't want anything heavy. Used the BJs app to order to-go and time was set for food to be ready at 11pm.  Got to the restaurant at 1055pm under the impression that our food should be waiting on the counter like any other takeout food that's been ordered for a certain time. Walk in and there are 3 waiters/waitresses standing in the takeout area using the computer...they ask for my name..I give it. One of the waiters decides to pop off at the mouth saying the person that runs the takeout area has gone home for the night and that I needed to go to the bar for my order. While still standing in the takeout area, one of the other waiters prints my ticket and tells me that he's gonna check on my order. I watched, as this pitiful excuse of customer service was happening, the waiter that printed my ticket didn't even go to the kitchen..he walked straight over to the bar..while I quietly sat at the bar behind them still watching n hearing everything..tell the bartender that he doesn't have time to go check on my food and for the bartender to do it..and I watched that same waiter clock out on the computer right beside where I was sitting at the bar and leave. So still sitting at the bar..waiting keeping my cool cause I don't wanna make a scene and after a good 15 minutes and watching the bartender make about 10 drinks...this pitiful excuse of help finally acknowledges me sitting there and ask if I was ordering a drink. Why the fuck would I want a drink when I'm here for a takeout order that I should have left with almost 20 fuckin minutes ago?!?!? Still being calm..I told him I'm not here for a drink but only my takeout order and the waiter that gave u my ticket left for the night and I just want my food. So then the bartender says he's gonna check on it but then starts making more fucking drinks!!! WTF?!?!?!  Still waiting...the sorry ass excuse of a manager had already walked past me several times..looking right at my black ass but never acknowledged the fact that I had no drink or food and had been sitting there for 20 gotdamn minutes and was clearly pissed off!!! Why would u not come and at least ask if everything is being taken care of?!?! Sorry bitch!!! So finally some other waiter that had passed by me several times asked me what I needed and he went and got my order that had been sitting and ready since the moment I walked in the door. Embarrassing!!! So we get home with our food that's not even fuckin room temperature warm...my fiancés salad...lemme just say we have had better prepackaged salads from a gas station then what she had last night. Lettuce was beyond soggy and wilted, no salad dressing tossed in to make it a Caesar salad nor was there any on the side. All it was was some bullshit with a chicken breast on top that had no flavor or seasoning at all. So called croutons look like they had taken some sliced bread and just cut the edges off, broke em up it pieces and threw them on top. The chicken club sandwich I had..was even that!! Soggiest of soggy sourdough bread that was a couple weeks old and attempted to be warmed up again. The chicken breast was one of the coldest, hardest, oldest, blandest, most embarrassing excuse for some chicken I had ever had in my life. The sandwich literally had one of piece of romaine lettuce that had probably been sitting outside all day considering it was so soft, wilted, and almost black in color. The bacon was even bacon! Honestly I really don't know what that was that I ate. Pray for me!!! We'll never go back to this BJs or any other BJs ever again until this place is completely revamped with food, service, and management!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lubbock
Amelia M.,"Lubbock, TX",0,42,14,3.0,11/8/2016,"I've eaten here a few times. I usually order the soup and salad deal. House salad with ranch & clam chowder. The house salad is always the same. Good. Nothing special, nothing terrible. Clam chowder is hit or miss. It could be creamy one day and unbearably salty the next. I ordered a burger for the first time, there was a hair, a long hair in the patty. It was absolutely repulsive. I can't handle hair in my food - accidents happen, I know. The manager was very apologetic which was great, no negative attitude at all. In fact, he comped my meal. Service was great and so was he. The hair isn't a reason to stop coming, but it's also not a reason to come as a regular. Hair, no stars. Service, five. Manager five as well.

The best pizza IMO is the great white if you like creamy Alfredo sauce, and if you like a combination of salty and sweet I would recommend the salted caramel pizookie. I would have given this place 5 stars, but the service could be more up to par. Last time I ate here, I had 5 orders accidentally almost come to my table.  Servers could be a little more accurate, and having been hungry and seated it's a tease to bring already made food to customers that haven't even ordered yet.

I have never been a fan of BJs but on a recent visit to Lubbock I wanted something easy and familiar so BJ seemed like the perfect sit down place to satisfy my two requirements.  My first night in Lubbock I was looking for a place to eat at 11:00 pm. Being a university town I thought for sure there would be a lot of options.  I was sadly mistaking. My options where BJs or Wingstop. That first night I ordered the Santa Fe salad with blackened salmon. The salad was fresh and crisp and had great toppings. The dressing was creamy but not heavy and the salmon was seasoned perfectly.  After a long day at work today we decided to again go to BJs bcz our first experience was so positive. Again BJ's did not disappoint. My coworker had the chicken lettuce wraps and she loved them. I had the barbecue chicken salad and it was absolutely wonderful. The veggies were crisp and fresh the salad was not overly dressed and it had a good lettuce to dressing ratio. We also enjoyed a skinny margarita and a light Mojito! Which was exactly what we needed after a long day at work. I likely will not go to BJ's near the area where I live because there are so many delicious dining options in my area. However in Lubbock I might decide to go to BJ's because I know they have good dishes that are familiar.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lubbock?start=20

Lynn W.,"Lincoln City, OR",71,391,360,4.0,10/20/2012,"More like 3 1/2 stars.  But they've just opened -- maybe they will get better. Not your local microbrewery.  Yes, they are selling their own brews, but these are not artisan brews of local flavor -- this is a big chain and thus these are the house branded mass produced kinds of ""micro"" brews. The food was good -- everyone at our table found something they really enjoyed -- from Jambalaya that met the standards of 2 former residents of NOLA, to a lavish little 6"" pizza smothered in cheese. My test for a chain is always to try their version of chili -- this is Texas after all, and if you're opening a place here and serving the state bowl -- you better get it right. Sadly, they didn't .  Wendy's Hamburgers chili is better -- and it's not really chili either.  BJ's ""chili"" was basically a scarce bit of meat and a couple of beans smothered in a starch-thick and paste-like gravy.  If there was real chili powder or real cumin in that gravy, they were well hidden.  It had none of the heat (or even warmth) of real chili (mine was only luke-warm), and was so bland in general that it was nearly tasteless.  Here's a hint: chili should be red, not brown.  Or beige, as this was.  Even in the dark of this low-light temple of corporate restauranteering, it looked like something that should have been scraped off boots in the parking lot.  Which is a shame since they sell it by the bowl, on burgers, on baked potatoes, and in several other menu-slots.  They need to visit Terlingua and buy themselves a real recipe. On the positive side -- the chili was the only big gaff at our table.  It was a 34th birthday celebration and the birthday-boy tried one of their beer samplers -- 5oz tastes of their 4 lightest brews.  He found 1 favorite (the Hefeweizen), 2 okay, and the last was left on the table.  -- the same percentages that our 4 meals ran. All in all, the building is beautiful; the menu is so elaborate that we all assume half the choices will vanish after the first 2 months of operation here (most of the chains that come here start with a equally broad menu and then narrow to match the tastebuds of the town); and, the mixed drinks from the bar were creative and adequate -- if a little weak.  The Friday night wait was (over an hour) long, the service was leisurely-to-slow, the volume was outrageous -- but the atmosphere was good.  People seemed to be happy working there, and eating/drinking there. They have a rewards-card program that awards points for non-alcoholic purchases, and their corporate charity is a self-named not-for-profit that supports the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lubbock?start=60

andre L.,"El Sobrante, CA",2,124,14,3.0,7/24/2013,Well maybe as an out of towner I expect too much.  BJ's locations usually have alot of very good reviews;  this location a total of 12?  Odd but based on prior experiences at other states I gave them a try.  Ate at the bar.  Nice server but service slow.  I got the feeling they lack training.  You order a drink and they proceed to do something else besides make your drink. Manager starts reviewing something on order data screen.  Still waiting for drink. Odd. No sense of urgency. BTW- first glass of red was close to spoiled- open too long. Food ok but not as good as other experiences at different BJs.  I had Moroccan salmon. Taste ok but menu picture nothing like what I received.  I posted both pictures.  I did really like Thai won tons!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lubbock?start=80

Anita C.,"Austin, TX",61,90,195,2.0,12/29/2013,"Been here a few times and always leave disappointed. Actually a little confused as to why I keep going back. Have yet to experience good service- have to wait about 5 minutes for a beer, and you better drink your water slowly- takes even longer for a refill. Avocado egg rolls were good the first time I got them so I ordered them when I went back- ""crispy"" was definitely not the word I would use to describe them, try soggy. I did enjoy the mahi-mahi tacos however they are tiny and you only get two, so don't count on these filling you up. Burgers are pretty decent, wings are alright, and they do have a nice beer list. I recommend BJ's if you want to grab a few beers- and have ample time to wait around for them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lubbock?start=80

Peter Z.,"Lubbock, TX",8,76,66,2.0,4/7/2015,"I struggled to give this restaurant three stars, so I came back and revised it to 2. We came there for a simple business meeting I ordered a burger cooked medium with bacon well-done, I received a Burger cooked medium well too well done definitely not what I ordered the bacon was on the medium side as well. The order had to be sent back and read cooked to the proper temperature. The potato wedges are disgusting, wouldn't feed them to my dog. It was the night of the NCAA men's basketball championship but the TV was set to split screen with baseball and two of the four sections, ridiculous. The bear was good although they didn't have regular Coors, I enjoyed some Boddington's instead. I probably will not return for a long time to this restaurant. Lastly, my chair wobble badly.

It came to me with half a plate of salad, one small scoop of mash and my gravy looked like they scrapped it from the bottom of the pan. My friend ordered Cajun pasta with blackened chicken. It came to her without ANY chicken!! We thought we had misread the description, so I asked if the Cajun pasta came with chicken. She said yes but it is small diced up chicken. Small diced up chicken?! Umm can you just bring me more chicken? She brings it 15 mins later and stands next to the table beside us with the chicken in her hand, waving it around like it was an empty plate. Umm no!

Derrick R.,"Lubbock, TX",6,7,,1.0,2/9/2013,"I have not experienced this level of terrible ever.  This restaurant went for the hat trick of TERRIBLE customer service, bad food, and ugly attitudes towards us for complaining about it.    We had a waitress (ashley) who was nice, but after taking our orders absent.  A different waitress brought our drinks (the wrong ones, and not good to boot), a different one brought our appetizers (these were actually ok) and then a different one brought out our meals.   We ordered 2 things that basically no one should ever mess up-  Chicken Fried Steak, and Fish and Chips.   My fries and the tartar sauce were excellent, but the fish and chicken fry was WAY over cook to the point of being burnt.  We waited for a long time looking for a waitress or waiter so we could complain.  I got up, went to the front desk and asked for one.  When he did show up (20 minutes later) he was less than helpful, not very apologetic, and rude.   THEN our waitress who we hadn't seen in almost an hour showed up to ask how we liked our food.    This level of service and quality of food was so bad, that I will make sure and tell every one I know on every social media outlet, in person, and any stranger I meet to stay well away from BJs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lubbock?start=100
Brandy L.,"Lubbock, TX",0,2,,2.0,1/21/2015,"2 adults and 1 child went for lunch on a Monday afternoon. Arrived around noon and were told we had a 15-20 minute wait. We waited 45 or more, as we watched everyone else that came in after us get seated. We were eventually told they were waiting for a table that could accommodate a high chair. The hostesses seemed to be very understaffed and were working hard to keep people moving in. Once we reached our table there was no sign of a waiter for maybe 20 minutes. We flagged down who we assumed was the manager after he talked to another table who were obviously unhappy about their service. He took our orders and we continued to wait. The food was good once it came. We were so hungry by that point. We had to ask for silverware and napkins after the food came. We observed the manager apologizing to 4 tables immediately around ours while we were there. Something is definitely off with the management or the way this place is run. It's too bad.

Then my hubby ordered the bone-in southern chicken, and received a breaded chicken breast. Disappointing. Food is definitely a little overpriced and menu is extremely large, sometimes this isn't a good thing, because then stuff gets lost in the shuffle, like our chicken and taco/tortilla orders.

However, when they brought our entrees out the potato had sliced cheese laying across the top....sliced cheese. I looked at it funny and The girl who brought it  out said ""Yeah, that looks weird."" I said yes, it should be shredded cheese. They brought me out a 2oz cup of shredded cheese. I had to ask them to take the potato back and bring out a fresh one with melted shredded cheese.
