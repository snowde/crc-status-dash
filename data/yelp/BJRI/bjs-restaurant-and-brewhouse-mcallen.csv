RE R.,"Pflugerville, TX",0,12,16,4.0,7/20/2017,"So for starters I came in at roughly 9:45 pm and they close at 12 am. Check your seats before sitting down.  It's a poor practice, but bussers are usually untrained and here the bussers lay the bus bin on the seats. I ordered the salad and the salmon with Cherry sauce. It was perfect and fast! ( I wont queation the use of a microwave) but the plate and contents were hot, which is a plus.   The glaze sauce was sweet and not overdone.  For a drink I ordered a citric beer, and the server also brought out a water, which is a plus on safety. Place is super clean, to include the bathroom. Customer service is excellent. Only complaint is the salad they brought...a little on the limp side (see photo.) Now on their defense, she offered to make another, but I wasnt going to waste what was brought and it really is a minor  thing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mcallen
Sandra R.,"McAllen, TX",45,196,909,4.0,6/10/2017,"Dinner this evening was great: pork chop, roasted cauliflower, baked potato, and a BLT salad with lots of spinach and some blue cheese.  Lutz had a tasty I.P.A. with a mango scent, but not flavor and I had a berry cider beer.   The wait staff here is always nice, polite and friendly.  Always knowledgeable and helpful with smiles to boot!  The pork chop was tender, the cauliflower came with a yummy sauce at the bottom of the bowl-I believe it was a mix of turmeric and peanuts.  It was so good, we dipped our pork chop into it!  The BLT salad was refreshing and delicious!  I will be ordering this again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mcallen
Regino G.,"McAllen, TX",826,248,1315,5.0,11/8/2017,This is always a great place to come too. I would say it's like going to the eye and bar and Grill. You can catch some sports while having some great beer or some great tasting food. My favorite item in the menu is the pizza because it's so good and well done that I would rank is in my top five or favorite pizza places. The bar area is huge and very relaxing with multiple large flatscreen TVs to watch your sports team. I recommend this place to anyone wanting to go catch a game or simply wanting to have some great food and beer.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mcallen
Jay M.,"McAllen, TX",1,2,3,3.0,10/29/2017,The wait staff is usually friendly and the food is decent.  The only negative I see when I go there is the lack of cleanliness in the restroom.

K S.,"Peachtree City, GA",0,58,,3.0,12/9/2017,"Three stars only for FOOD The food consistency is always good. My only concern is with service staff. We went back to have dinner this week.  When my soup was served, i observed that the soup spoon was unclean ( as if no one washed it from previous use) and when service staff was informed, response was OK and just walked away with the unclean spoon.  Also when service staff was cleaning out the table ,she had the plates from next table and picked ours along.

Caterina S.,"Pharr, TX",90,24,44,4.0,6/4/2017,"The server was very nice and even recommended some of his favorite dishes, and my friends ordered it and loved it. I had ordered the Portobello Swiss Burger with sweet potato fries. I asked for the burger to be medium, and it came out perfectly cooked. The fries were a bit over seasoned with salt, but it was bearable.

Michael J.,"McAllen, TX",0,15,,3.0,6/19/2017,"My wife and I visited today, so I thought I would get around to finally writing a review. First off... the food at BJ's Restaurant Brewhouse is pretty expensive; unless you have a coupon or order one of their specials. The food does taste good and they are a very techie restaurant (and I like tech), so it sort of balances things out. My wife and I use the BJ's app where you can place your order before you leave the house and they start working on it as soon as you are being shown to your table (the hostess checks the order in). My wife ordered the Roasted Chicken Peruvian Quinoa Bowl ($12.95) and I ordered the Prime Rib Dip Sandwich with fries ($14.95). The wait for the food was about 20 minutes (a little bit on the long side considering we were seated at 3:40 PM and the restaurant was practically empty) even though our order went in before we were seated. The food arrived pipping hot and we were also warned about the hot plates by our server. The fries are seasoned and very tasty; they serve a generous portion. The Prime Rib Dip is very tender and the au jus had a good flavor; just right for sandwich dipping. For me, the $14.95 for a sandwich and fries is a little on the pricey side considering you can get a full meal at similar restaurants for less. My wife's told me that her Chicken Quinoa was very delicious with just the right amount of ingredients to complement the chicken breast (Peruvian quinoa & brown rice blend, sautéed red onions, sliced mushrooms, sautéed spinach, seasoned tomatoes, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil & lemon juice). Our server checked in on us several times to make sure we had everything we needed. The service was good! We paid our bill through the BJ's app which accepts Apple Pay (very convenient) and our receipt was emailed to us. Reason for Rating: Cost was a big part of it. Though the items were very good, the quality was comparable to restaurants like Logan's and Chili's where you can get a full meal for less. Had the prices been a little bit cheaper, I would have given the restaurant four stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mcallen
Amy F.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,88,1,2.0,2/18/2017,Was excited to find a late night eat place to hit when I get off of work around 11PM. My group usually hits Roosevelts and I think we'll have to stick to that from now on bc BJs crashed and burned. A bit unfair to judge harshly when an establishment is an hour from closing but these guys just couldn't get it right. Plus we'd have been in and out much quicker without the following issues.  I was with 4 others and was told about about 5-10 minutes after ordering the item wasn't available - which means I had to sit waiting for my new order while everyone else's food came out earlier.  Two salads had to be returned because of bad tuna. And one replacement chicken salad was missing the chicken.  Sorry guys. Won't be back!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mcallen
Cynthia O.,"McAllen, TX",9,22,18,4.0,5/4/2017,"I LOVE BJ's! It's expensive but the service is always friendly even I had a $10 off coupon! They gave me the opportunity to exchange a side for a soup, OMG Tomato soup was amazing!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mcallen

Sergio R.,"Miami, FL",0,5,,1.0,6/12/2016,"The food is ok, is it worth the price on the menu? No. Service? Some of the worst I've seen. Waited 30 mins for the waiter to come get our drinks, then after my tasteless burger was brought to the table I had to wait 45 mins for someone to come by our table and ask if we were ok, to which I replied ""No, my cold fries need ketchup!""  I got a Guinness draft for my drink. I know, at a brewhouse? Nevertheless, if you go to a place that specializes in beer, you'd think they would know how to pour a damn Guinness into a glass. If you don't, it ruins the flavor!  The only positive? Their handcrafted beers. Great variety and tasty brews. Thumbs up on that. But there's plenty of restaurants that offer great food, service and brews for the same if not lesser price. Will I return?  If I'm starving and all the surrounding restaurants within a 50 mile radius have shut down, yes I will.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mcallen

This restaurant used to be my favorite; the best food, service and atmosphere but an unidentified manager stops by your table and asks how everything is /was.  He / she wears no identification and does not introduce himself.  It is like some dude from another table wonders over and wants to start talking to you.  I do not need nor want ANYONE other than the server to attend me.  I want to be left alone and enjoy the experience with my bride.  If I have a problem, I know how to address it and don't need to be asked for a verbal review on my server.  I'm done with BJs.  There are too many other restaurants that have better table-side manners.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mcallen

Shelby Q.,"McAllen, TX",39,4,1,1.0,8/27/2016,"We initially ordered water, with the intention of getting drinks later on. To bad our waitress never came back after we placed our food order. AND then 45 minutes after we placed our order for a single medium deep dish pizza. The man who I'm guessing is the manager brought our pizza, apologized for the wait and quickly left. (again still not able to ask for our drinks). Now this would've been fine had the pizza been hot. Unfortunately it wasn't. It was warm at best. We brought this up to our waitress who said they thought the pizza was for her own personal consumption. Where the miscommunication is between the servers and the kitchen I don't know.

Amy L.,"Phoenix, AZ",2,18,2,4.0,9/30/2015,"Had a nice long hospital shift here in Texas. After our adventurous palate led us to disaster last night, we wanted to go ahead and try to safety of the large menus that BJs had to offer. We started with the stuffed mushroom, and the Siracha Brussels sprouts. The Siracha Brussels sprouts were roasted to perfection. The creamy Siracha sauce was spicy enough to give an interesting kick, without upsetting my somewhat sensitive stomach. The mushrooms gave me an off aftertaste. They are supposedly stuffed with artichoke spinach, but it tasted more like a jar of Kraft fettuccini sauce and some broccoli.  For dinner I was craving a salad. The picture of the ahi tuna salad looked incredible. So far our service has been very quick and our server seems nice. Update haven't seen our server in a very long time. Hope she's ok Update still no sign of server. She is visible. She is alive. I want desserts in the form of cookie goodness they call a pazookie. Pazookie has arrived. I am happy again. This cookie makes me so happy. The food was filling and absolutely delicious. For a restaurant that wasn't busy by any standards, our server did disappear for a long period of time... But it happens. I would definitely come back if I needed to ever be in this part of Texas again.  Thanks BJs. A good BJ never disappoints.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mcallen?start=20

Jennifer W.,"Plano, TX",590,1054,544,5.0,10/12/2011,"All I can say is WOW. Customer service at BJ's should get a hundred stars in comparison to other restaurants in this area. It seems that treating the customer nicely and being polite and helpful is a rarity in the valley, but BJ's has it down. Also, they have great food and great beer. I loved their fried artichoke appetizer and their gourmet mac n' cheese. Mmmm... so freaking good.  Main courses I got to try a lot of different things as I snacked off other's plates. The patty melt was actually really good, so are their french fries, I got to try the Parmesan Crusted Chicken (recommended by our AWESOME waiter Fernando) with a lemon/butter sauce which was delicious. It came with white cheddar mashed potatoes that were awesome as well. I didn't get to try it but one of my workmates couldn't stop raving about how awesome the pizza was!

E P.,"Humble, TX",9,7,14,3.0,8/3/2014,"This is the first time I have been to BJs and I was upset to find out I have never been before in the Houston area. I enjoyed walking into the restaurant because the place is kept very clean and the entrance has a spinning door. When walking in I was immediately greeted and brought to an area to sit down. When ordering my drinks and food, I never had to ask for refill when I ran out. Now the question is...why give this place a 3 Star instead of 4-5? Service was great but the food was very mediocre. Maybe I expected more because of the environment or maybe the chef in the back wasn't feeling it. For the price it is definitely worth trying out but just don't expect for the food to taste as if you are going to a 5 star restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mcallen?start=20

Armando A.,"Mission, TX",0,4,,1.0,8/7/2015,Waited for 40 minutes for a burger; it was undercooked. Waitress takes it back 20 minutes later brings out an over seasoned burger trying to mask the flavor of a cold burger.

Lauren B.,"New York, NY",409,257,953,4.0,8/13/2012,"Located in the center of the newest McAllen developmental area and convention center, BJ's is always full of people but even with a full restaurant, I've never had to wait! Score. The menu is huge with over 14 pages of brewskis, vinos, salads, pizzas, apps and even steaks ::pink up:: - how do you choose what to get? I'm a creature of habit and when I find something I like (especially at  a chain restaurant) I tend to stick to it. Start off with one of their beer/cider blends... they're interesting & mostly yummy! If you don't drink alcohol, I'd suggest a draft root beer or cream soda! If you want an appetizer but don't want to order too much, get a couple of the ""small plates"". My favorites are the meatballs and crispy artichokes. I love their chopped salads (BBQ and Crispy Chicken), pizzas (with whole wheat crust) and pizookie cookie deserts!  Customer service isn't the best.... very medicore. The servers I've had at this location were dry and boring (even when my dad cracked a sad joke) but when they brought the bill, their demeanor changed as if one smile at the end of the meal would give them a 20% tip. My dad likes watching football games in restaurant bars & their TV is HUGE (literally 100 inches) & daily drink specials are pretty good.

I asked if they forgot sauce and the server and manager both said pizza sauce was not used on Bj's pizzas. Pizza with no sauce? This went from being one  of the best pizzas in town to the worst.

Anna B.,"Austin, TX",1,32,2,3.0,5/5/2013,"The ceilings are high, the light is low and the prices are above average. Start with the menu: several pages, encased in vinyl and bound like a notebook. There is a lot to consider there but in the low light, I probably missed a few things. It's ironic, there was a lamp suspended right above us but still we could barely read the print on the menu. Our waitress was pleasant enough and checked on us often. But she's not the one who brought out the food. This must be one of those places where it takes a village to serve a meal. The food was okay, not bad, but nothing outstanding. The kitchen's approach to seasoning is not balanced: their chili is fairly bland but the CFS is overly salty and a little heavy on the garlic tones in the breading. Their fries are crispy shoestring-style and good. They use Roma tomatoes on their burgers so they have a bit of flavor. The ""huge"" baked potatoes are indeed huge. I would have appreciated being given the option of leaving off some toppings or having them on the side but mine came fully loaded, no turning back. Maybe if I could have read the menu more easily, I would have seen the full list so I will take some responsibility for that. The atmosphere is that of a slightly upscale sports bar trying to be a date place. There were women in sequins and stilettos; some men in suits, others in cargo shorts. There were a few children but I wouldn't really consider this to be a family restaurant, at least not on a weekend evening. The darkness and loud urban music would make my child uncomfortable. And the TVs? They have TVs alright, and there is no escaping them. The bar is prominently stocked with a large variety of higher-priced hard liquors. The bottle display is perhaps the most brightly lit area of the whole restaurant. You can easily tell what is important here.  The managers make a point to come over and greet customers. Ours said all the right things but his words seemed rehearsed, possibly scripted.  Over all, it's not a bad place but we don't expect to go back. It was not a great value for the money. The dining room is much too dark and the noise level (an odd mishmash of musical genres did not help) was a little too much. The place seems to appeal to the Generation Y types who like flash with their drinks and food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mcallen?start=40

When you're out shopping, frustrated as hell by the wonky parking lot and disrespectful best buy shoppers, this is a decent spot to grab a table, some relatively inexpensive appetizers and a high ABV beer.  The service is usually decent, if unremarkable. My mom loves the sausage and basil flatbread so much that she ordered one as an appetizer for all of us and one for herself, for her meal. The avocado egg rolls are kinda boring as is the tortilla soup. My asian salad was okay as well.  All in all, not bad.

Bex F.,"San Antonio, TX",32,62,35,4.0,7/5/2010,"BEER! okay so there's 3 things you should go to BJ's for, and everything else can just be appreciated. 1)Beer 2)Pizza 3)Brewed Root Beer The beer is not actually brewed there, which is a huge misconception and I've had to correct a few ppl myself who think otherwise. The exposed cylinders to the right of the bar are actually Root Beer. The pizza is sooo good and I recommend the Mediterranean I would not steer you wrong. Any other Pizza is to die for as well. The bread has a foccaccia texture to it. Its infiltrated with butter in every bite or sense of taste bud you mite actively possess. The Fish tacos are huge and filled with cabbage. Ive ordered these quite a few times.  The Veggie burger again not anything special but not really any other option, so if you feel like a burger veggies, go for it. Beer recommendations **Brewhouse Blonde, its light and slightly malty. ***Piranha Pale Ale, you'll taste the hops in this one ****Jeremiah Red, ur Irish style beer, if ur in the mood, or maybe ur replacement for ur other Irish beer. *****Tatonka Stout; if ur bored from other stout, why not give this a try. they have a seasonal selection as well as imported draft beer! Also for two draft beers ur bill will be $11. I've only had bad service once, usually there's one server there who if you get here, you're lucky shes excellent. Best seat is at the bar, learn about beer, watch 6 different sports at once.  If you're looking for something more private ask to be seated towards the west side of the restaurant on the other side of the garage doors. You can stare at art if you want. and have conversations without the bar crowd. i like it over in that sections sometimes. Bj's is designed like a street corner shop, except the where the outside seating would be, is enclosed and they open up the doors so as to use it as a divider between the back room and the middle room.  note: My dad loves the Chicken Fried Steak here, believe me when i saw it i didn't have to ask why, if u got a tickling for it, give it a try as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mcallen?start=40

Justin E.,"Harlingen, TX",16,15,10,1.0,7/31/2012,"This has got to be one of the worst restaurants I have ever visited. The customer service was HORRIBLE! First, our waiter took over 10-15 minutes JUST to come and welcome us and since we had a child, he forgot her menu, not once but 3 TIMES! We felt very rushed by him because he was very antsy and constantly looking around and checking the time. When we put in our drink order, he took a while to come back for our food order. When he returned I had already finished my first drink and placed the glass at the end of the table for him to take to refill. I SAW him glance at it and ignore it. He passed by it about 2 or 3 times before I finally had to tell him that I wanted a refill. I had ordered Strawberry Lemonade and let me tell you, I've had better. I should of seriously just gone down on restaurant and eat at Cheddar's. Anyway, we put in our orders, My friend and I's entree was Fettuccine Chicken Alfredo, Macaroni for the little girl, and my other friend had dessert because he had already eaten earlier.  The food arrives and we requested ketchup because the little one had gotten potato wedges. The Alfredo was so bland and tasteless even with salt and pepper. The chicken was alright, but the bread that comes with it was so hard! Well the little girl preferred the Alfredo since my friend didn't like it, so they traded. As soon as she puts her fork in the plate, she pulls out a large piece of plastic that looked like it was from a microwavable bag, since it had heating directions. Needless to say, she did not eat that. When the waiter comes back, ages later, we had to request ketchup a second time and the manager. When he returns, he said the manager would be there shortly. I did not see him go tell the manager till about 10 minutes later. The manager shows up and I explain to him our situation and he immediately begins to apologize profusely, which I appreciated, and he asked if we wanted to replace the meal, we decided against it and he said it would be taken off our ticket, which it was.   All in all, I was not very pleased, and the bill was ridiculous. $14 for a plate of tasteless pasta! We will more than likely not be returning for a VERY long time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mcallen?start=60

Good wine selection, had a very good Russian Valley Chardonnay. Jackie was my waitress, I never had to ask for anything, she anticipated it before I could ask. The kinda bad news- the chef needs to take a trip to Lafayette, LA. Adding 1.5 pounds of green onions to a tomato sauce and pouring it over pasta does not a Cajun pasta make. It was really bland.

Steven F.,"Harlingen, TX",0,5,1,2.0,7/7/2014,"Service is horrible. This was our first time at the restaurant and we were underwhelmed. We were seated promptly, but that is the only thing that happened with any sense or urgency. We ordered our drinks and didn't see our waitress again for 15 minutes. We were about to get up and leave when she finally showed back up. We ordered and my girlfriend got a salad, which did come out first, but 30 seconds later my meal came out. Hers didn't come out for another 5 minutes, and I didn't touch my plate until she got hers, because it just seems wrong when your date hasn't gotten her plate yet. This is all happening at 2:30 pm on a Monday; place is dead and can't get anything right. I got the jalapeño burger and it was bland, at best. My girlfriend got the angel hair pasta with grilled chicken and liked it a lot.  In short, I wouldn't recommend this place if you're looking to grab a bite to eat with good service.

John B.,"Harlingen, TX",0,21,,3.0,9/11/2012,"BJ's has always been one of our Valley favorites, usually worth the drive from Harlingen. The food is consistently good (not great) and the service OK. We sometimes watch a major sports event on their 100"" TV while eating in the bar. We also order takeout once or twice a month. Several of our favorites are pot stickers, sesame chicken salad, egg rolls, wings, and pizza. I'm surprised BJ's isn't ranked higher than #14 in McAllen. It would be in the top three in Harlingen.  9/11/12 UPDATE -- Takeout last evening was worst ever. Pot stickers were bland and the sesame chicken salad (price raised to $13) was tasteless. To make matters worse they packed about 3/4 normal dressing after I asked for extra dressing!

Josh G.,"McAllen, TX",0,5,3,5.0,1/6/2011,"BJ's is one of my favorite restataunts for a number of reasons: 1. The food is always cooked to perfection. 2. No one can beat the number and quality of specialty drinks 3. You never feel crowded, as the restaraunt has an open airy feel wherever you are seated. 4. The menu is huge, and you can find something new and interesting try every time you go. Don't miss out on this wonderful dining experience- you won't be let down. P. S. The low noise level and atmosphere definitly pushed this one up to a 5. My favorite drink is the root beer, which has unlimited refills, is made by the restaurant, and is served in a chilled mug. Chicken pot stickers are a great appetizer that you don't find in many places. BJs is famous for their deep-dish pizzas, which can be filled with any number and combination of ingredients, and range in size based on the number in your party- and are DELICIOUS (meat lovers takes on a whole new meaning at BJS). Staff is also very friendly, helpful, and attentive.

So good, in fact, that we also visited the location in Clear Lake (Houston area/Baybrook Mall) when visiting family. The beer and pizza were quite good. But in the past 3 months, we've been twice, and had issues with our food. Both times, the food was way undercooked, when we finally received it. After speaking with the manager (who appeared already aware of our plight), we were offered a half off deal for our meals I actually felt sorry for the manager, as it seemed that he had dealt with this same issue too many times. After speaking with friends, we learned that they, too, had had this same experience in recent months. So if each party of at least two gets a half off discount--how are these people making any money? I don't think the franchise is being properly supervised.

Quani C.,"Austin, TX",588,476,64,4.0,9/25/2008,"For the first time in my history of Yelp, I felt inspired to leave a ""You've Been Yelped"" card... and this was the place.  It's new to the area and the first of it's kind around here, as well. Location is primo, near the convention center and a plethora of new shops.  We stopped by after a quick trip the Target around the corner.  Our waitron, Levi, was fantastic.  He was courteous (even calling me ma'am once... shudder) and VERY knowledgeable about the house beers.  I had to try to figure out if it was rehearsed or if he actually knew that much about each of those beers, a total of seven.  I opted for a beer sampler to get a feel for things and he brought me a mini sample of the Octoberfest gratis as well (ask for a scoche, that's what they call it).  Beers were tasty, I think the pale ale was my favorite.  The others were pretty similar to each other, but not too memorable.  Their porter is very smoky. The menu houses a wide variety of foods from deep dish pizzas, to burgers, to sandwiches, to pastas, to typical pub fare.  I had fish and chips, which were offered with malt vinegar.  I also had my choice of wedge fries or crispy, thin fries... I went for the wedge.  The fish was well battered without being over the top, heart attack inducing.  My mom had the patty melt and says that it was ""very good with crispy, grilled bread.""   It was pretty dead at the time we visited, but it was between lunch and dinnertime, so it was understandable.  The restaurant was impeccably clean and dark, almost formal feeling... but not really.

We were lucky enough to arrive during happy hour which is M-F 3pm-7pm (I think) $1 off draft beers, $2 off all appetizers, and mini pizza's were half price! WOOOOHOOOOO!!!! My friend and I took advantage of the drafthouse and had blonde beer.  It was pretty good and really strong (about 5% alcohol according to our server). And I believe it, because I only needed one to feel flushed. ;) Our Appetizer: Pirahna Nachos!! They were HUGE and REALLY GOOD!. Not at all greasy. The salsa on the side was my favorite touch!  Entrees: I had BJ's Favorite mini pizza which comes with meats and veggies. I LOVED IT!! Loaded with toppings and nice soft bread. MMM!! My friend had The Great White mini pizza that had alfredo sauce and chicken. She liked it too.  Overall, I really enjoyed the meal and had good service. AND since it was Happy Hour, our pizzas came out to $5 bucks a pop! That's cheaper than Little Ceasar's ""Hot & Ready"" and the taste is INCOMPARABLE!!  I also thought the ambience was great.
