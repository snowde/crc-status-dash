Barb F.,"Melbourne, FL",454,105,8,4.0,7/11/2017,"I""d give the food 3 stars... not terrible but, similar to things you'd find at a chain restaurant. I ordered a flat bread and a salad and it was decent. I gave them an extra star because our waiter, Brent was GREAT! He was fun, friendly and made sure we had everything we needed.  I will go back because it is good for groups and really affordable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-melbourne
Da Q.,"Brooklyn, NY",42,32,51,4.0,12/26/2017,This place is super awesome... From the food menu to the waiters / waitresses to the drink menu's with a completely full bar.

Aracely M.,"Colorado Springs, CO",1,20,27,1.0,8/28/2017,"Disappointing! Was looking forward to enjoying a burger w/ fries and waitress, although very sweet, forgot the fries/utensils. Burger buns were cold, no barbecue sauce on burger & cole slaw? Are you serious? It was very brown & very dry. I truly have never felt so disgusted after leaving what's supposed to be a really, nice, classy restaurant with great food. I feel like just making myself throw up!

Manny C.,"Casselberry, FL",230,43,62,5.0,11/22/2017,Amazing service and fantastic food! Came here for BJ brews on Wednesday for $4 amazing. I recommend the BJs Hefeweizen which is smooth and light. I had the spicy peanut chicken and soba Noodles. It was amazing. I forgot to take a picture because it was so delicious but I highly recommended. Ask for Brittany when you come here.

Barbara M.,"Melbourne, FL",0,14,16,5.0,11/10/2017,"First time there for the veterans meal and one free beer. You have to go to their website and they send a code for the free beer. My husband really liked getting a free beer. They also don't limit what you can order like most places. You get $12.95 off you meal. Hubby had a hamburger and fries, so mush he couldn't finish. I had the Jambalaya was nice and spicy. Rather than wait for a table we sat down at the bar. The service was just as good and no waiting for a table.

It's a bit pricey for some certain dishes, example: the spaghetti and meatballs is almost the same price as a sirloin steak, but that's a very minor complaint. The staff is very accommodating and we never run into any problems with this place.

Jen W.,"Melbourne, FL",81,25,22,4.0,1/16/2017,"We have enjoyed this restaurant since it opened. Their food is always good and worth a bit of a slow wait staff. Their app and rewards program is handy. You can put your name on the wait list right from your phone.  I must give one down side. The entree quality does seem to be slipping. I had the ahi tuna salad tonight and the amount of tuna was about half of the first salad I had when they opened. The salad was great, but a little disappointing. We have noticed this with other entrees.  They do have good desserts meant for sharing.

Michael M.,"Orlando, FL",260,1027,1636,3.0,4/17/2016,"I arrived with a group of eight and I was told it would only take 10 minutes to get a table for a late lunch. The place was busy but not packed. 30 minutes later we were seated. Our server was very friendly and helpful with the menu. I am notba fan of their beer so ordered a cocktail and it was delivered in a reasonable amount of time. I wanted to sample a few apps so I ordered the calamari, root beer ribs, and a wedge salad. The food took forever!!!  The calamari was very good but the mayo base dipping sauce was a total fail. The root beer ribs were off the hook delicious and I really should have made a double order. The wedge salad was good but could have used just a drizzle of balsamic. A good experience but there is room for improvement.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-melbourne
Tiffany D.,"Tallahassee, FL",16,5,,3.0,9/30/2017,"Probably my last visit to this restaurant. Nothing is really good here which is a shame because it has a good ambiance. Ordered the bacon guacamole burger sans mayo, cooked medium rare. My son ordered same item but with mayo, cooked medium. Guess what- both had mayo and the kitchen runner could have cared less what the burger temp was. Sides were left off, too. No silverware, had to request drink refills (some were alcoholic so you'd think that would be a no brainer for the server). Pointed out issues to server who said, ""Oh, ok.""

Janet G.,"Melbourne, FL",8,16,14,2.0,11/11/2016,"For the life of me I can't figure out how this Sysco food truck vittles could rank a 4 or 5! I had the previously frozen spinach stuffed mushrooms. They were the size of a nickel! That's not a stuffed mushroom! I had to look hard to find anything in them! The rest of the Fam got Mac n cheese (kraft) chicken wings with watered down ranch dip, it was just heated up boxed processed food. We got there at 5:30, seated immediately & waited 40 min on our food! So the waiter comes to apologize saying the kraft Mac n cheese was the hold up! It's one thing if you are drinking but we were not!  Crazy people if you think this is REAL food..... they do not have anything special although the menu weighs 10#!

Meghan Y.,"Palm Bay, FL",1,7,,3.0,6/24/2017,"Sat at the bar thinking that the service would be quick at 1 pm on a Sunday, but instead we sat for 30 minutes waiting to order lunch.  To be fair the first round and menus arrived promptly, but it seemed like that was the extent of their training.  After 30 minutes the wait just isn't worth it so we left and went next door to the Outback instead. We even tried to talk to the manager on the way out but as soon as he made eye contact he quickly walked off in the opposite direction.  We have been to many other locations with no issue, but this location just doesn't cut it.  Next time we will just drive to the Orlando location.

Jean P.,"East Bridgewater, MA",6,37,116,5.0,12/9/2016,"Visited this restaurant on 3 different occasions and the service and food were excellent each time. They have a huge menu, dozens of cocktails and beer selections and a wide variety of food choices for even the most selective of customers.  The Honey Sriracha Brussel sprouts were worth ordering more then once - they are awesome. The Flatbread Pizza was good but the deep dish pizza was mouth watering and outstanding! The entrees were plentiful and served hot and without a lengthy wait, even on a Friday night.

Tila D.,"Melbourne, FL",101,107,317,4.0,4/8/2016,"Hubby & I gave them a try, we were a little hesitant due to some of the previous reviews but I had a person tell me about their experience and their food so we thought we would give them a try.  We were not disappointed at all! Our server was Blake, he was friendly, quick and very helpful with explaining some of the many choices on the menu. My food was good, the spinach/artichoke dip was a little plain but it was hot. I had the hickory brisket & burger and it was AWESOME and the crispy thin fries were delish!! Hubby had the New Orleans and he really enjoyed. There was a little issue at the table behind us with an unwanted guest but the manager apologized and took care of the problem.

Chris S.,"Melbourne Beach, FL",6,57,,2.0,8/11/2015,"I've been to this location twice now, and I must say, the one in Orlando is WAY better.  Here are my issues:  First: the food isn't as 'fresh' tasting. I really liked the one in Orlando because it was a chain restaurant that I didn't mind going to. Here, food doesn't taste as 'fresh.' In fact, it tastes no better than food from your local Chili's.  Second: The service is slow. Like really really slow. I understand they just opened, but it's been three weeks and they still don't have it together. Did I say slow?  Third and most appallingly: the price! My fiance and I went in for a dessert (that we split) and one drink each and the bill was over $30 before tip. The pricing is insane. Not a good way to greet a new market.

Gemma S.,"Indialantic, FL",10,5,,2.0,8/2/2015,"Went at about 1 o'clock on a sunday. Was told there was a 25 min wait, a manager then came up to me as I was giving my name and told me a booth at the bar opened up, after he sat me, I sat there for 10 mins while no one greeted me, and he sat at the top of the stairs and made no move to make sure someone was coming to the table. Someone finally dropped menus off (not our server) and I waited another 10 mins to be greeted. All in all it was 25 mins before I even had a drink in front of me. Any where else, I would have left by the time it got to 25 mins with out a drink, but I really wanted to try it.  I got the brussel sprout appetizer and they were burnt, and looked nothing like the picture in the menu. My entree was good, and so was the beer. Our server was sweet and attentive once she actually got to us. Next time I think I'll save this place for having a beer at the bar while I wait for Togo food.

Ava G.,"Melbourne, FL",224,35,1,5.0,7/27/2015,"Late Sunday night and hungry, I think all Melbourne residents have ran into the problem.. what's open? Aside from the very played out TGIFs, Applebees, etc.. we gave one of the new restaurants by the mall a chance and BJ's kitchen is open til 12 am on Sunday! The atmosphere of this place is awesome. A mixed vibe of Yard House and World of Beer. Menu has something for everyone, and although it's not ""Cheddars cheap"" you will get every dollars worth with the portions sizes and quality served. The Rewards program is also a nice little niche as well!  Will absolutely return again, and I hope they have the Sunday Ticket coming up this September! Update 7/31 Went back again for soup and appetizers.

My Melbourne BJ's is getting there.   To date I have eaten there 8 times.  When it first opened, service was about as bad as it could get.  With a lot of turnover, it has gotten much better.  The food is very good, with the Rib Eye being my favorite...California Flatbread and burgers also are excellent. They carry a wide range of beer, to include my favorite, Cigar City Jai Alai (on tap)!

Sean F.,"Melbourne, FL",3,6,,4.0,2/6/2016,"Had out-of-town family in for a visit and were looking for good food and good beer. When I mentioned the Brussels Sprouts with Sriracha Cream appetizer it was a no brainer - they'd never been to a BJ's before and we've enjoyed every visit there. My cousin's wife is gluten-free and really enjoyed the gluten-free pizza offered. Burgers were great (Brisket&Bacon burger and Jalapeno burger) and my wife enjoyed the kale salad with shrimp. Great selection of options for eating. Only disappointment was that you were out of the seasonal IPA I wanted to try but it's not like you don't have choices there. Almost forgot, my wife is a fan of the Wyder's Dry Pear Cider. As usual, the service was outstanding. One additional note(now that I saw the other reviews):  The food they serve really does come to your table as advertised (the photographs are representative -nice portions and well assembled).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-melbourne?start=40

Julie F.,"Rockville, MD",15,7,,5.0,8/4/2015,"I had a great experience here: TL;DR: Come get awesome beer and food here. Have some patience with the kitchen service, they just opened.  Long Version: First of all their beer is pretty awesome; not only do they have a great selection of craft beers, but they also have a wide variety of their own brewery's beer (brewed in California but still awesome quality).  Second, the food was really good. Important seeing as it is a restaurant and not solely a place for me to nerd out over beer. They have an extensive menu and a lot of different selections for those of us who want to save some calories for the copious amounts of beer to be had. I plan on coming back to try their burgers and a bunch of other items on the menu...their pizzas looked pretty awesome too.  Finally, the kitchen service was pretty slow...but that is to be expected when a restaurant has just opened. What made the slow food amazing was the service our waiter and the whole waiting staff had. They accidentally sold our dessert to another table, instead of hiding the mistake and blaming it on some random occurrence they completely owned up to the mistake and told us what happened. The manager came by and gave us both a complimentary dessert voucher (of which we plan on using when we come back) and made a potentially bad situation into a positive experience.  I have high hopes for this place and plan on watching a few games here.

We had the fried portobellos which were okay. I got the ribeye and my wife had the sirloin. I asked for medium rare and received a well done steak. When I showed Sharon she immediately took care of it. The next one came out good. My wife's sirloin was tough and her Siracha brussel sprouts were way over cooked.

Marci W.,"Melbourne Beach, FL",0,37,,2.0,6/16/2017,"The staff likes to seat people on top of one another and make no effort to space the customers although many seats, including booths, were available, That is easier on staff as they don't have to walk as far but bad for customers who would like to enjoy their meal without having to listen to other conversations from the people sitting right next to them. Tables are very close togeather.  If seated near to a loud month who never shuts up a challenging experience and not enjoyable. They have simple 6 inch dividers between tables, which if seated in one makes it appear that the stranger sitting on the other side is actually at your table. Poor, Poor, design.  Concrete floors and high open ceiling make for poor acoustics and a very loud experience.  Service was slow! The waiter didn't know the cost of an unpriced but promoted beer.  He never asked how we wanted our burger as in rare, medium, or well done.  Made several flip comments. The food was good although overpriced. Cheddars down the street is much better at 20% less.  With tax, beer ranges from $6-10 dollars a pint and they have a lot of craft beer choices.   Again, overpriced!  Good food but a really poor atmosphere and slow service mean we will never go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-melbourne?start=40

You can figure out how much was left of our lunch hour. When I asked about the food, I received an earful about how 20 people just sat down at the same time. This is BS because the place was mostly empty when we arrived. A table next to us had a couple that sat down after us and received their food before us.

Table next to us left because they waited too long. Next to them table was brought 3 orders of fries as the first 2 were cold. My Asian salad was good but not award winning. Wife said Pizza was good . Took 1-1/2 hour for lunch and restaurant was only 1/3 full.

Baron J.,"Melbourne, FL",22,28,3,3.0,8/10/2015,"Ate here 4 times so far and took out once. PROS: They try really hard. Extensive menu. Some very good menu items are tavern cut pizza, burgers and fries, tomato and mozzarella salad, house salad, homemade sodas, fired mozzarella sticks, salted caramel pizzukie, and strawberry dessert. Food brought out fairly quickly after ordering. Nice decor and interior. CONS: Long wait times when you sit down, they have to solve this. Website issues preventing ordering on-line. My take out order took an extra 40 minutes. I sat at curbside for 40 minutes. The server gave me free fries and 2 sodas.  They totally botched my wife's Santa Fe salad. Pan pizza not great. New Orleans Jambalaya way too spicy, almost inedible, they need to adjust this recipe. One night we ordered coffee and they had no creamer of half and half.

You get what you pay for though (it tasted amazing so that's probably why). Kind of loud and the lighting was very dim bar-like. Some seats are definitely going to be better than others. Our waiter was very kind and sweet and he made sure we were completely taken care of. The hostesses were also very understanding of the griping from customers. They handled it very professionally, even though personally I would have handled it way worse than they did. The location is very convenient. Right next to the melbourne square mall.

Charlene H.,"Indialantic, FL",58,24,310,3.0,8/1/2015,"I visited last night with my family. A party of 3. I was excited to try this new restaurant that just popped up in my area. The decor is urban industrial much like a lot of the new restaurants. The menu is a big book where the first three pages are nothing but brews, wines, and cocktails. The rest of the menu was the usual things like sandwiches, burgers, pastas and deep dish pizza, which was on my mind. So I split the medium Gourmet Five Meat deep dish with my Mom.  She thoroughly enjoyed it but I found it to be rather dry , lacking cheese and sauce. The crust was crispy and had a good flavor but I had to order a side of marinara. The appetizer of artichoke bites came out late but I don't believe it was the servers fault. The manager came out  and personally apologized which was very professional and appreciated. My brother ordered a personal great white pan pizza and I tried a bite. It was delicious and creamy with alfredo, chicken, mushrooms and tomatoes. The side wedge salad was delicious and they gave me extra dressing and blue cheese crumbles upon asking. I will return one day but will try the parmesan crusted chicken I was eyeing or a different pan pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-melbourne?start=60

Lalena B.,"Las Vegas, NV",237,232,781,4.0,1/9/2016,"Experience:  I've been to a BJ's before, but a new one opened close to my family's house and I decided to force them to try it.   Facility:  this just opened a few months ago, so it's pristine. The restaurant feels very open but still a little dim ambience. It has mostly dark woods in the decor. There's a large bar with about 50 taps, and booths, chairs and tables in the adjacent dining area.  Service: Jasmine was our waitress and she was a sweetie. She did forget our bread and we had to re-ask for our appetizer after the cooks made a mistake, but other than that, she was a great, friendly waitress.  Food:  we thought we were going to order beer, but saw two margaritas we had to try instead. We got an appetizer, but filled up too much to eat our meals. So typical. LOL!  --Jalapeño Cucumber Margarita - 5/5 - LOVED this!!!  It was just the right balance of tart, spicy and refreshing. It had fresh cucumber and jalapeño slices in it. LOVED --Watermelon Basil Margarita - 2/5 - Although the flavors were nice, this had a heavy sweet flavor I could not drink. Just too sweet!!! Not sure if they add sugar or it's the watermelon syrup, but I was looking for a lightly-sweet watermelon flavor the way fresh watermelon juice is.  --Sriracha Queso Dip with Pork Salsa Verde - 5/5 - so good!  I loved the Queso and salsa; however, the pork was pretty nonexistent. Still a yummy dish.  Rack of ribs with Root Beer BBQ sauce - these were great!! They had to add the root beer sauce on top of the pre-basted ribs, but it was really good!!   --Sides with ribs: Brussel sprouts and French fries - 4/5 - I liked both. The fries are thin skinny fries and were lukewarm, but still tasty. The Brussel sprout were not bitter at all and roasted good.  Overall:  good food, nice waitress and great drinks!!! I would definitely come back again. Maybe not this location in FL, as I live in NV, but I really like BJs restaurants!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-melbourne?start=20

She said she would take care of it right away. 40 min pass and we're getting ready to leave. Use the restroom one last time before the drive home and realize that still no one had filled the soap in the ladies room. Also, there was no toilet paper in the stall I was using. I then asked to speak with a manager to make sure it would get taken care of. The manager was rude, offered no apology but basically blew me off.

My only complaint would be my fries were not crunchy enough. However, that is minor and they were still pretty good.

I ordered one of the kinds they make, and the accidentally brought me a Stella. Both had this weird sort of smell and flavor to them that I can only attribute to taps that need to be cleaned?

Ken H.,"Orlando, FL",248,83,76,4.0,9/26/2016,"I haven't had the desire to go to BJ's because I've always related it to the wholesale grocery store and in my head, it just didn't evoke hunger and food cravings.  My wife came across one of their coupons so we decided to give it a try.   The atmosphere is very cool and casual.  There are tv's on the walls all around the perimeter playing live sports.  There is a full service bar serving up whatever you feel like drinking, including, of course, their own brand of handcrafted beer.  I'm not much of a beer drinker but I did try the Nutty Brewnette and it was a great accompaniment to my dinner.   The only problem I had with the seating is that we were in a booth along a half wall and there were also booths on the other side of the wall so it was almost as if you were eating at the same table as these other people.  It was a little distracting and you don't get much privacy in those particular seats.   The menu doesn't have anything earth-shatteringly original but they do have a pretty extensive selection of foods.  I decided on the half slab of pork ribs which came with 2 sides.  What I was very happy to see is that they allow you to choose a bowl of one of their soups as one of your sides.  Most places will allow you to add on a cup of soup for a certain amount or try to upcharge you if you want the soup as your side.  Here, it's included as a side with no extra charge.  I chose the clam chowder and also the white cheddar mashed potatoes.  I'm not the biggest pork ribs fan because to me they are usually too tender, almost fatty, but these were as good as one can expect to get.  The barbeque sauce was quite delicious.  The mashed potatoes were a little on the pasty side but did have a good white cheddar taste.  No complaints at all with the clam chowder.  It was perfectly seasoned and had the perfect viscosity.   For desert, they have their Pizookie's which are cookies baked in individual miniature pizza type pans with ice cream served on top.  We got 3 mini's and chose the monkey bread, the salted caramel, and the peanut butter.  They were out of this world.  The cookies are crispy on the outside and so moist on the inside.  I never leave room for desert but was so glad I did this time.   Also, they have an app and a rewards program where you can earn points and get free stuff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-melbourne?start=20

Tonya H.,"Palm Bay, FL",136,282,549,2.0,8/9/2015,"I do not even know where to begin....I let's start with the pros.....cool place to go if you like beer. They had a ton of beer on tap and they offer a flight of 4, 5 oz pours for $7.95.  Their happy hour ended at 6:00 pm, which was a bummer ( I missed by only a few minutes, because I thought it was 7pm. But it did offer $3 for 2 of their craft beers on tap and $50 shareable apps, and mini pizzas. I have to admit that's all the pros I have because the rest of the experience goes down hill :(. Mom and I opted for the calamari for an app.  You know it's bad when the server comes over with her face squished up because the food was burnt.  She stated it never comes out looking that dark.  It was greasy, gummy, and not crispy at all. I asked the server for some recommendations, she stated after 2 weeks she had only tasted 1 meal and that the restaurant did not offer the servers samples of the food before the restaurant opened.... We move on the meal....The deep dish sweet pig pizza.  I had high hopes for this one as many people there ordered the pizza and it looked decent.  However, I was sadly disappointed.  Now I like butter as much as the next southern girl, but I don't want my pizza to taste like it.  Not to mention as I ate the meal, I kept thinking that something was off with the taste but could not put my finger on it.  We then looked a the menu...and they forgot to add the pineapple to the pizza which was clearly in the description (and I loves my pineapple).  So disappointed.  I forgot to mention we had the stuffed mushrooms, which were just ok.  The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because the server without me prompting, or asking her.  Found the manager and was able to have the calamari and pizza taken off the bill. Kudos to her!  The mixed drinks are also pricey, pomegranted martini (which tasted like a tart slurpee) was $10.

Asked for ketchup and a refill of the iced tea and then waited. Our sandwiches were good, fries were cold, and did I mention that the service was sloooooooow.  If you only have an hour for lunch, go someplace else. Great bar area lots of interesting beers on tap.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-melbourne?start=80
Kayla W.,"Melbourne, FL",19,18,26,4.0,12/18/2015,When we went it was packed but we got our table for 7 within minutes. The decor and temperature was great. Very friendly staff. We got the artichoke dip with chips as an appetizer but it was tiny that we kept having to ask for more chips. We also had to ask for drink refills each time as they were not offered. Portions were big and the food was fantastic. I will be returning!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-melbourne?start=80
Chris T.,"Melbourne, FL",15,16,,1.0,9/1/2016,well the place is clean enough but my complaint has to do with to go ordering i ordered 2 burgers( to go) no drinks or anything and my bill was over 35 dollars holy cow! second i received different burgers than i ordered and had to wait 20 minutes past the stated pick up time to get them. which is the reason i didnt give them back i was hungry had to eat in the car as now i was 20 minutes late for my next appointment. well i can go to walmart and buy meat and cook it faster and better and for a 10th of the cost.  oh and was really unimpressed that the hostess was more into her phone than helping customers. my visit was about june 9th and is still fresh in my head as one of the worst expieriences ever at a restraunt,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-melbourne?start=80

Gina H.,"Melbourne, FL",0,4,,2.0,12/30/2015,"Oh gosh not sure where to begin..  We ate at BJ's last night as it was our daughters 15th birthday.  She picked BJ's as she had visited a few in CA and loved the pizza cookie!   Throughout our dining experience we had a total of 4 various waters/waitresses assist us.  The place was packed, very busy and quite loud.  I always felt that the service at BJ's was lacking and slow in CA, well the Melbourne location is just the same sadly!  Communication between the 4 waiters/waitresses was extremely lacking and/or nonexistent. We were asked the same questions over, workers tried to deliver food to our table that we did not order, however there were 2 incidents that really turned me off.   One, when I asked for advice concerning an entree the waiter had no idea that item was on the menu!  He had me show him the page and proceeded to tell me, ""he had not tried it, heard of it or had anyone order it"" - it was the Sriracha macaroni and cheese with bacon entree..  I gave it a try as the rest of the menu was pretty bland and uninspiring..  It was actually very tasty however the portion was the size of an appitizer.  Secondly, one of our 4 servers brought my daughter her free birthday cookie.  Roughly 5 minutes later anpther waiter came to our table with a lit candle and another pizza cookie.  He saw our daughter eating the cookie and apologized as he did not know someone alrighty brought it.  He proceeded to blow out the candle and took the pizza cookie and ice cream back to the kitchen!!  Wouldn't one expect the waiter to offer us to keep the desert as it was his mistake?!  Who wants a recycled desert??!!!  Yuck..  Needless to say we will not be back....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-melbourne?start=80
Lisa H.,"Palm Bay, FL",2,18,14,4.0,12/2/2015,"Hubby & i went for dinner on a Wednesday night. It wasnt busy when we got there, but shortly after was busier then i would have thought on a week day. FOOD- was good we ordered the fried artichokes they were good but definitely frozen chain restaurant food.  i had the balsamic chicken with a mozzarella tomato side salad. Little heavy on the basil in the salad, but good.  but the chicken was cooked perect & the white cheddar mash was Yum!!  Hubby had the Bison burger it was exceptional,  juicy, flavorful it came with an Asian type coleslaw. He doesnt like slaw but likef this one. The beer choices here are astounding. I dont like beer but hubby tried 2 different flights i actually liked the berry burst cider. We tried the Pizookie as well couldn't decide if i wanted the salted carmel or triple chocolate server recommended half & half. It was ok from the description i expected a thicker moist cookie. It was good but kinda thin and hard. We had super awesome server named Shawn. He we attentive,  knowledgeable and made great recommendation on the beer. He had many tables and still did a great job. We will be back for sure. As i was writing this the manager Ken came by and talked to us. He was very nice. I am not sure why BJ's has a 3 star rating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-melbourne?start=80

Nadia J.,"Melbourne, FL",51,7,,1.0,8/15/2015,"ordered baked mac n cheese and the $17 tuna salad for dinner. The tuna on my salad was overcooked and not rare as described on the menu. I asked them to remake it. After twenty minutes the server came back and said ""apparently they're not going to cook it correctly, so you need to pick a different item off the menu."" At this time I showed them my mac n cheese was completely dry not creamy, and inedible. He agreed took it back. I picked out the bbq chicken pizza next- at this point my friends have finished their meals. 45 minutes later a server comes back I ask for my check and request to take the pizza off my bill as I never received it. We were at the restaurant for over 3 hours in total and I really feel they should have comp'd my beer at least since I was never served a correct dinner and left the restaurant hungry after being made to sit for so long. My boyfriend's burger was overcooked and dry and crumbling off the bun. My other friend received a different pizza other than the one she ordered. Terrible experience and I'll never come back. The server hid from us and managament never took initiative to make things right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-melbourne?start=80
David T.,"Melbourne, FL",1,2,,5.0,3/7/2016,"I'm a pretty big fan of the whole breakdown of the brewing process on the back wall.

Mary L.,"Melbourne, FL",92,58,28,3.0,8/29/2015,"We went there for lunch today because Red Robin was packed.  BJ's was also packed but had high tops available in the bar area.  The service was as good as it can be when you are slammed.  We ended up ordering beer the moment our beers arrived because there was a lag between ordering the beer and receiving the beers by about 10 minutes.  We both had burgers which were okay.  Not bad, not great but good.  I still think Coasters has the best burgers in Melbourne.  One thing I did notice as I waited for my beer is that there was at least 6-8 tables empty in the dining room and standing room only at the hostess stand.  I am not sure if they didn't have enough servers or a slow hostess but if I was waiting 20-25 minutes and they had empty tables all around I would not be very happy.  I do think this place will be a good place to watch some games.  They have nice TV's all over.  Once the newness wears off you might be able to get a spot at the bar to hang out.  With all new restaurants you need to bring your patience and keep your beers coming.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-melbourne?start=80
Rochelle H.,"Gainesville, FL",7,4,,2.0,8/1/2015,"Tried this for lunch today with my husband and son. Good concept, poor execution. The wait wasn't bad and the order was correct, however the service was terrible. We had their ""signature"" deep dish BJ's Favorite pizza which wasn't bad but nothing to rave about. My son had the BBQ  brisket bacon burger which he did rave about. The style of the place is that service is provided by multiple staff. My guys got rootbeers which were very good. My husband finished his mug and placed it on the end of the table. I watched as at least 6 wait staff walked up and down the aisle visually scanning the tables. His glass sat there empty for no less than 20 minutes without anyone asking if he wanted another or even to clear it. I over heard one young lady tell the table behind us that she was helping train the staff. She also walked by at least 4 times without acknowledging his empty glass. The final test? A box was requested for the remaining pizza which never came. Think they need some more time to get their act together and some better trainers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-melbourne?start=80
Joe W.,"Seattle, WA",0,13,,1.0,8/19/2015,I've been to this chain all over the country. Started off very excited to get craft beer. The servers knew nothing of the drink offering. The food was okay but nothing special or even on the better side of good. After being rushed to place an order very disappointed when it took 45 minutes to get out to go dessert and check.

Elaine G.,"Rockledge, FL",9,24,2,2.0,7/31/2015,Horrible experience... Waited over an hour for a table so was expecting good food. Ordered an appetizer it never came out and the waiter wanted to bring it out after our food came and make us still pay for it! Ordered the pesto chicken breast sandwich and there was a large bone in it. I am only giving it two stars because the manger took my food off the bill.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-melbourne?start=80
Piper K.,"Melbourne, FL",402,38,32,2.0,11/12/2015,"Came for Veterans Day and was just not impressed. We knew there would be a wait but by the time we were seated the rush had died and there was no reason for the snails pace of everything. First we were sat at a dirty table, it had been flipped and set for the next guests but was still covered in crumbs. The hostess was off before I could tell her, and we sat there for a good 5 minutes before it was cleaned. Everything we ate was clearly frozen and not fresh, mediocre food at best. Same with drinks, basil watermelon margarita was recommended but was sweet syrup sans alcohol. My chicken club was disgusting and I only at 1/2 the chicken on 1/2 the sandwich. Brought the chicken home for My dogs. Despite my barely touched plate, No one once asked how was it. Husbands burger was equally unremarkable. We are ideal customers, like to eat out, try new things and have a cocktail, too bad BJ's you lost a good opportunity. It took a good 5 minutes for anything to be brought or refilled. 2 stars because our server Caroline did refill my daughters water 1 time and did seem to be trying. Overall it was disgusting and I don't understand the people that like this type of food, sheep. Over priced and overrated. Will not be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-melbourne?start=80
Rachel C.,"Melbourne, FL",25,4,4,2.0,9/20/2015,"I need to start off by saying that the ribs were delicious - tender, moist, and flavorful. Those delicious ribs are the sole reason this place is receiving two stars as opposed to one because everything else was pretty horrid. From the absent server to the bone-dry mashed potatoes to the overcooked, shriveled asparagus, all the way down to the completely uncaring, useless manager, this place just fails.  We had a party of three and were sat in a booth in the bar area. Right off the bat we ordered waters and a beer, and the beer took a good ten minutes to get to the table despite the restaurant (and bar) being pretty dead. There were only a handful of tables sat throughout the entire restaurant with more than enough wait staff to cover. Waiting on our server for no apparent reason was definitely the trend for the night. The other two members of my party ordered a half rack of ribs and when we received our food their racks were considerably different, so the person with the 2/3 sized rack asked about it. Eventually the waitress came back and told us the cook just made a mistake when cutting them. That was it. No solution offered.  She did ask the manager to stop by our table, but this only made things worse. The manager did not apologize, did not bother to fake a smile/good attitude, and she failed to even ASK about our experience AT ALL. She simply said she would bring out more ribs (keeping in mind we informed the waitress at the very beginning of the meal and the manager couldn't be bothered to stop by until long after we'd finished our food and were just waiting idly with our partially consumed plates). Had she asked about our experience she would have learned about the unsavory side dishes and extended wait times. The waitress eventually stopped by to ask if the manager had come over and started to leave after we answered yes - we had to flag her down to ask for our checks. When the manager brought the ribs to the table, she again failed to offer an apology or ask about our experience - just dropped the bag at the table and left.  The icing on the cake is happening now - we arrived home and opened up the ribs to try and uplift the evening, and unlike the ribs we enjoyed in the restaurant, these are chewy and burnt from being thrown on high heat.

Tiffany L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,3,,2.0,8/8/2015,"This was a poor experience, which is sad because I'm not typically a complainer, and we were so looking forward to trying this restaurant. We waited quite a long time for our food once our table ordered, and when my top sirloin steak came out, it was extremely over cooked. I sent it back and waited 30+ minutes for another. By the time it came, everyone else was long since finished with their meal. Although it was cooked better the second time around, it was a dense, sinewy cut of meat. I found I had about 6 edible bites. There was no effort on behalf of our server to give any kind of break on our bill due to the steak or the wait. I understand the restaurant is new but customer service is key. I won't be back for their food - all 3 of us who ate together agreed our meals weren't up to par.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-melbourne?start=100
Pat S.,"Malabar, FL",0,1,,2.0,9/13/2015,Ordered a chicken Alfredo pasta. The garlic bread was hard and cold. Asked the waiter for fresh bread since our original waitress wasn't around. He told her the message and she brought out new garlic bread.. But it was still cold. Had to ask her again for fresh bread got it the 3rd time. My friend ordered. Shrimp scampi pasta and it didn't have any taste. When we told the waiter he said they got a lot of complaints on that menu item and there's bread crumbs in the pasta which doesn't take appetizing. She asked for root beer WINGS and they brought out root beer RIBS but she settles because she also like wings. Rate this restaurant a 2 for today's service.

Nancy L.,"Titusville, FL",1,22,,2.0,10/24/2015,"Asked server if items could be prepared without cilantro.  It seemed to be an ingredient that was in most items (lost one star for that alone).  Server said oh yes, of course.  So I ordered fish tacos, no cilantro.  I asked for all sauces to be separate because they inevitably serve sauces loaded with cilantro.  Food arrives.....the lettuce was chopped and thoroughly mixed with a significant amount of cilantro.  The salsa they brought also had cilantro.  Not sure what it means to say ""no cilantro.""  I pointed it out and asked for lettuce sans cilantro.  Brought small amount of lettuce (no onions, tomato, or anything else).  Half my food was left as I tired o picking cilantro out of the mixed up mess.  Lose the cilantro and honor your customers' requests.  I do have an allergy to cilantro.  Could have been a very bad deal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-melbourne?start=100

Peg P.,"Melbourne, FL",0,14,,1.0,2/18/2016,"Visited BJ's last night for dinner.  I asked the server what she thought was better, the Chicken with pesto sandwich or the shrimp tacos.  She said the shrimp tacos were really good and so that is what I ordered.  First it arrived w/out the avocado crema.  Took about ten minutes for the server to swing back by our table.  As I was dressing the tacos, I looked for the shrimp.  Hard to find in all the shredded lettuce? and carrots.  Found three really small shrimp.  The meal included tortilla chips.  There were 5 very greasy chips on the plate buried under the tacos.  The shell that the lettuce/carrot concoction was in was kind of like a pita that was soggy and hard at the same time. I waited another 10 minutes for the server to speak to her about the lack of shrimp in the tacos, but she was nowhere in sight.  Finally got tired of waiting and ate the ""salad"".  When she finally stopped by with the bill, I told her that they should take the tacos off the menu as they were not good.  If I had wanted a salad, I would've ordered one.  Her reply was sorry and left the bill.  We will not return.  Poor food and Poor service.  Zero stars!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-melbourne?start=100
