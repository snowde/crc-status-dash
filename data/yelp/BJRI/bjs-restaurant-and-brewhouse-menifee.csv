Blair H.,"Hemet, CA",2,157,459,5.0,12/4/2017,It was our second time at the Menifee location because we usually drive to temecula. However we are very glad we made the stop here for a weekend family dinner because everything turned out great from the service to the food. We were seated immediately even though there were larger parties waiting ( there was just 4 of us so we got a booth) The server Nathan was a delight. Very clean cut and well groomed and so professional that it made out dinner even more enjoyable. He had a bright smile on his face and never lost patience with any questions we had about the items. He made suggestions and we chose a couple of them and didn't regret it. He never made a mistake and was prompt with appetizers and refills and entrees. Not a single issue all night Mark the bartender who made our drinks was very fast and nice as well.  The food was delicious with the  exception of the fried calamari. It was over cooked and too much breading on the outside. That we will not order again. It was the only dish that nobody liked. The rest however was good from the salads to the rib eye and shrimp scampi and burger and of course the pizzoukis. Those were excellent  Overall a great location and dining experience so we will go back for sure. Thanks Nathan and Mark!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-menifee
Michael A.,"Menifee, CA",33,8,,1.0,1/3/2018,"Always the worst experience. I have eaten at BJ's about 10 times and with the exception of the 2 times I have nothing but complaints.  In June of 2013 my family was in from out of town a large party 15 showed up and we had 5 star service ad the food was outstanding.  The 2nd good experience was in Feb. of 2014 when I took my son for his birthday, again good food and good service. Now for the bad in the roughly 8 other visits there have always been issues.  Hair in the food, slow and poor service, food coming out cold and the list could go on and on.  I'm not sure why I waited so long and tried so many time before learning my lesson and just writing this restaurant of my list.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-menifee
Ramon E.,"Hemet, CA",0,1,3,1.0,12/22/2017,"embarrassing...my first visit ever to this place and last. i received a gc for xmas, purchased a ""deep dish pizza"" it was all dough. 28 dollar piece of dough. it was disgusting, it had maybe 10 pepperonis, and a sprinkle of cheese. if i'm paying 28 dollars for a tiny ass pizza it better have toppings. my first and last time to visit this restaurant. i don't know how the managers could allow for such low quality food being served.                                                            follow up so the manager or owner post this b.s. about being sorry for the incident and says they want to make it up.  i contact them via the email they left in their post twice, guess who hasn't responded. if you guess right i will give you some advice on where not to go to get some s#i%y ""deep dish pizza"" for 28.00 dollars",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-menifee
Marcus H.,"Murrieta, CA",0,4,,2.0,12/10/2017,"Take-out service definitely needs improvement. It's never ready on time when I order ahead and it's not a smooth process. It seems like it's a brand new concept at this location every time I go. Maybe they lose track of which refrigerator they place my order in? It has to be that because the food is always somewhere between slightly above room temperature and cold (at the take-out counter).  I also thought they raised the price of the family feast and reduced the size, but no, after reading the labels at home I noticed they only gave me 4 of 5 of my items for the new higher price... Even better! I'll stick with Domino's for take-out for the foreseeable future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-menifee

This location is newer, and I love the openess of the seating. One thing that is a bummer is parking. It can fill up pretty fast. The pizzas here are delicious with scrumptious crusts.

I'm less concerned about the 30 minutes I've been waiting for my order than I am by the lack of acknowledgement. Once a young man said ""your order isn't ready"", I asked him how he knew as I haven't even given my name yet. He said because the 2 take out orders are still in the oven, then he left. Now, 30 minutes later, I stand here not knowing if it will be another 5 minutes, 55 minutes, or never. Understand, this is 30 minutes past the stated pickup time.

Aiko N.,"Oceanside, CA",250,255,502,3.0,5/28/2017,"I had a gift card I got over two years ago that I wanted to use. The food is overpriced here! I mean, 12$ for a few avocado egg rolls!! I got a spicy peanut soba pasta with chicken for 14$ that was of good quality but small in portion. It's on the Better for You menu, but really there's no healthier ingredients. It still clocked in at over 1,000 calories!  It's both good and bad that the menu is so expansive here. Meaning, there's something for everyone but freshness is questionable.  Good service can really set the tone (and even help justify prices) when ambience is lacking, but they didn't give that here. Our server pretty much forgot about us after dropping off the food, and my water glass stayed empty. We had to flag one down for the check, as well as to pick up the payment.  I would only return if friends want to go. It's so busy here even at off-hours that I only see myself waiting if I have a gift card to use, not because I really like eating here.  Pros: - booths - lots of parking - house beer menu Cons: - meh service  - overpriced - misleading ""healthy"" menu is just smallish portions using cheap ingredients  - crowded, loud - overall ambience",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-menifee
Caris T.,"Perris, CA",0,3,,3.0,1/8/2018,"Came here with my boyfriend on a Saturday night around 11 pm for dinner. While there were no complaints about our server who was nice and very helpful, the food was just not up to par this night. I am a Bj's fan and already knew what I wanted before we had gotten there. Calamari to start, a Shirley temple, jambalaya as my entree, and a pizookie to finish with. First strike my Shirley temple came with no cherries. Which is mando for me ! However our server did bring me out four when i had commented about them being missing. Secondly when the calamari came out it was horrible. It tasted as if it had been fried in old chicken oil or something. Also while it did have a few single pieces majority of it was in a big clump that was just stuck together making it not appeasing. After letting it sit for a while I finally mentioned it to the server who agreed that it did look like a big clump and said she would talk to her manger. The calamari was taken off the ill thankfully. My boyfriend and I both ordered the jambalaya which was just okay that night. Last was the Oreo pizookie. One of my favs ! Another server brought it out and just dropped it off at our table with no silverware, so we had to wait for our original server to come back (about 5 min) after to finally get us some. Overall, with the exception of the food it was a typical Bj's experience. I just don't think I'll be giving this one a try again, or at least not so late in the evening. Maybe that had been the reason for the calamari being thrown in old chicken grease.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-menifee

Our calamari was dry and over done with skinny little tentacles on it. Not high-quality meat. Our server was not very friendly and I had to ask her for drink refills several times. The air conditioning was blasting too high so we were freezing and the wait to get into this place is very long which is surprising because the food sucks.

Steve B.,"Wildomar, CA",191,12,29,1.0,7/2/2017,"I've had meals here before where everything went well. Today however was not one of those times. It started when one person in our party got the wrong item. By the the time they got their food most of our party was done eating. Everything took soooo long. There were other food problems too. I don't think it was entirely the server's fault, but by the time we were ready to go the check had still not arrived. I stayed behind to wait for the check so by the time it came, I was ready to talk to a manager.  When the manager came she did not introduce herself either by name or as a manager. She just put the free dessert (that we didn't want) on the table and asked if there was anything else we needed. She listened as I told her everything that was wrong with the meal. She apologized and again asked if there was anything else she could get.  Any normal server would have seen that the only way to make this right would be to comp the check but this ""manager"" is obviously the reason that things weren't going smoothly to begin with.

Service lacks at this location I don't know if it is poor employees poor management lack of management or who knows but 15 min.

Michelle S.,"Hemet, CA",73,30,141,1.0,5/6/2017,"This is our final review for this location....Seriously this place has the worst service!! I think today was a final straw and the pizza was terrible, only reason I will be back is for a pizookie and it won't be the Menifee location. Pizza was overcooked and borderline burnt and dry and they replaced it and brought us our dessert before the new pizza and then we were too full to even eat it. I'm not one to expect compensation for their shitty service and food but did today and we got nada but a full bill with not even an apology. Wendy (according to receipt) in the bar area was slow and inattentive, may be a nice person but not good service and the manager, she even said something wasn't right and pizza shouldn't have looked that way. After she took it away she never even returned. We've tried on several occasions to give BJ's a chance after bad service here but this was last straw. We will try Temecula location instead from now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-menifee?start=40

Stefanie E.,"Menifee, CA",0,24,3,2.0,2/17/2017,"I've had problems with this place since day one. The first time we visited was around opening. We got seated and waited 45 minutes for someone to even walk past our table. The only reason we got anything was because we went to the hostess and asked for a manager.  The most recent issue I had was the beginning of the month (February) I had a late notice birthday party and I called around 3p to see if I can set a reservation for 6-8 people. The man told me they don't do reservations for less than 7 people and that I'd need to call back 30 min before the time we'd be there. So I call back 45 minutes before we wanted to be there and the girl said they're booked up and for a party our size we'd have to do a reservation which is I thought I was doing.  Apparently the guy mixed up reservations and walk ins?  So now she's telling me they're booked for weeks and it's a Saturday night so it was packed and we're looking at a 2 hour wait.  I was so upset! We ended up going anyways,  that's what she really wanted, and Luckily birthday girl still had a good time. We ended up waiting almost the full time even though the Place was half empty.  I just remembered another time. We took my in-laws out to dinner and my sister-in-law's Burger was not fully cooked so my mother-in-law sent it back and when they brought the burger back out it was the same burger that she had already taken two bites of and they had just thrown it on the grill for a little bit longer. If I was at home I would not have a problem with something like that, but the fact that they did that in a restaurant makes me wonder how many other people's food they did that to after they've already put their mouths and their hands on it. I give them 2 stars because there has been an occasion or two we went with little to no problems and the food tasted pretty good",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-menifee?start=40

Mercy S.,"Yorba Linda, CA",43,69,37,2.0,12/8/2016,"Came here because we love BJs signature Great white pizza. But.... We didn't get anything great the first time around. The clam chowder tasted very bag in the box salty like. The salad was good, but it's salad. The Great white had 0 I mean 0 cheese nor Alfredo sauce. Halfway through the hubby finally realizes why I've stopped eating. Because there's no sauce or cheese. Coming from the food industry either they used cheap cheese and burned it off or just skimped on it to where it's non-existent after melting off in the process. We complained and luckily got a server that listened bc she said the second pizza came out the same and so she told the mgr who then showed the ""cook"" how to make the 3rd one. That's the only reason they got the 2 stars A for effort on the server's part. Pizookie was good but it's a chocolate chip cookie with Vanilla ice cream again not rocket science. Which apparently the Great white is at this place. Don't go here if you're hangry let alone hungry be a use you'll turn very Hangry waiting for the right pizza to come out.

Janine W.,"Temecula, CA",49,2,2,1.0,10/12/2016,"While I use Yelp to check on places I would like to try, I have never written a review. I felt that this experience had to be shared.  Worst service EVER!! 3 servers working a party of 25 and we rarely saw any of them. When one finally did come by we asked to order more drinks and also have guests who had arrived 10 minutes earlier  (and never acknowledged) order some cocktails. We were told that this server was not their server (the new guests) and she could take our drink order but would send another waitress by to get the new guests order. I ordered my beer with my waitress at the same time as another friend. His drinks were brought out 8 minutes later but mine was not brought for another 7 minutes. At this point I was contemplating going straight to the bar to get service. Not only was it difficult to order cocktails, we couldn't even get our water glasses refilled.  A few guests arrived after the majority of the party and ordered their food a good 15-20 minutes after the rest of the group. When food started coming out they auctioned off the food and gave food to the people who had just ordered while those of us who ordered earlier waited (some had ordered the same items as the earlier group). .  None of the servers ever came by to ask how our meals were. They never pre-bussed any plates and dishes were literally stacked on our table when they brought out the cake and stayed there until after we left. When they brought the cake they put plates down then gave us silverware in the plastic containers that are run through the dishwasher. Very tacky!! I spoke with the manager who discounted our bill but it did not compensate for ruining a special occasion gathering as all anyone could talk about was how horrendous the service was.

Both me and my dinner date were out of water and clearly needed refills, with our waitress even mentioning bringing some over, unfortunately we never once received one refill. The chips we received with our spinach and artichoke appetizer were dirty, with ranch and some other sauce dripped on various chips throughout the pile, and with our waitress MIA for half the meal there was no ability to address the issue.

Ed H.,"Anaheim, CA",27,9,,5.0,11/15/2016,"Wow...what a mixed bag of reviews! Time for this bird to sing. I've been a BJ's fan since the opening of the original brewery location in Brea 20 years ago and have visited somewhere in the range of 50 - 60 of their locations. That said, Menifee is easily in my top five...let me tell you why: * Quality: Yes, I have my favorites like the Jambalaya on an infrequent rainy day and the pizza is always a strong go-to. My family and I have never had anything less than a stellar presentation at this location.  * Variety: My son is a very picky eater and my Wife and two teenage daughters are even more so. As a result, it's hard to find a restaurant all can agree upon, BJ's is the exception because of the myriad of choices. Burger? Check.   Pasta? Check.   Pizza? Check   Ribeye? Perfectly done. * Cleanliness: This place is the cleanest around. [Caution: Sexist, apolitical rant ensues] I often joke that you can generally tell if the General Manager of an establishment is a man or a woman by the emphasis placed on bathroom cleanliness. I'd bet dollars to doughnuts that the GM here is a woman because everything (including the restrooms) is generally spotless. There, I said it. * Service: The service here is always attentive enough without bordering on overbearing. That says something, because a pretty big chunk of their business comes directly from Sun City; and those folks can be pretty hard to please at times...I've witnessed it firsthand on many occasions. So, haters are gonna hate...but I'm here to tell you that this place is as close to rainbows and unicorn tears as you are going to find in a 20-mile radius.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-menifee?start=60

Randy N.,"Tustin, CA",4,44,4,1.0,8/19/2017,"I see we are not alone in our bad experience here. I don't even live in the area but took a family member to dinner here, party of 3. We got on the list for a table with 45 minute wait but found an open table in the middle of the bar area. We agreed amongst our party we would be fine to eat in there. However the staff walked by us so many times, didn't greet us, no one helped us or acknowledged us. It was ridiculous. We were passed by at least 5 employees and totally ignored. By the time a server asked if we had been helped, it was at least 20-30 mins later and we decided the service would be bad in there so we waited for our table instead. It gets worse from there. Service was slow, server seemed overwhelmed. Normal non-alcoholic drinks took forever and refills didn't happen throughout meal. They cost 2.95 each so it would be nice to get the refills. Our pizza came out but we hadn't received our salads. The pizza wasn't cut all the way through so the server tried to help and ended up forcing the spatula along the semi cuts and pulling all the toppings and cheese along with the spatula. The pizza looked terrible after she did this. We were hungry so we ate it. The manager came and said the salads would be on the house, which was a nice gesture. The salads finally came out but mine had no dressing on it nor on the side. I waited another 15-20 mins to be able to ask for it and even after telling the server I didn't receive it until we were done with our pizza. We came to celebrate a bday and told the server that. She said we would get a free pizookie for that person. We got it but it was not free - it was on our bill. We had been there so long that I just paid for it and we left. The dinner probably took almost 3 hours. No wonder the wait is so long. Not the service and food quality I would expect from years of going to BJs. Good thing this is not my BJs.

Cindy T.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,5,,1.0,12/3/2016,"Recently moved to this area and was thrilled to find BJ's nearby. I didn't want to believe the reviews because we've always loved eating at other BJ's and have hosted our pre-holiday family dinner for 25 every year since 2010.   This location is horrible, the food was mediocre and the service was terrible. We went for Sat AM brunch at 10:30 am and there were only 4 other tables of diners yet the waitress was so slow and unfocused. We ordered coffee and I swear she went to Columbia to harvest the beans, grind and brew the coffee. We ordered lunch salads and had to flag the waitress for more dressing which took another 7-10 minutes. Lunch was delivered by a runner but we couldn't find our waitress for catsup. We had to walk around the restaurant to find someone to finally get some. The topping was we paid cash for our bill but the waitress completely shorted us on the change, so it was deducted from her tip. When we left, there were about 7 other parties and at least 3 other waitresses and a bartender, so they were not short staffed by any means. Needless to say, we won't be back to this location.  An important message to BJ's management: the service at this BJ's is a reflection of YOUR poor staff training and overall poor management skills.  It's all about customer service and if you can't train your staff correctly, you will continue to lose good customers and your business will truly suffer or close down.  In the food industry, taking care of your customers should always be your top priority.  FYI, I have never written such a poor review EVER but was truly disappointed and disgusted with our experience.  1 star was overly generous and BJ's corporate office really needs to investigate and follow up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-menifee?start=100

From silverware and cups that are nearly always dirty and lipstick covered, to getting SOMETHING wrong with the order (wrong side with the kids meals, dressing on the salad instead of the side, missed toppings on the pizzas- even slimy/wilted salad leaves and rotten tomatoes served to our table). The staff makes a half attempt to get it right, but it feels like mistakes are so common here that they don't even think they're a problem. I've been to plenty of other BJ's and most are great and run well, it's unfortunate that we can't visit our hometown one as it just never got off the ground quite right.

Sally A.,"Placentia, CA",86,31,8,1.0,5/29/2015,"Updating my review from a year ago. I decided to try them out again, figuring everyone has a bad day and maybe I just caught them on one of theirs. Nope. This is hands down the worst restaurant in the area. First I came in on my own with my 3yr old & 1 yr old. I know they're my kids and my problem but when I specifically ask for a booth with a high chair, I kind of expect someone to bring a high chair. The hostess just left me standing there holding a baby for a good 5 minutes until I had to grab my 3 yo and take him with me to find one. Not one server who whizzed by me asked if I needed help. Clearly if you see someone standing next to a table with a baby on their hip and there's no high chair in sight, they need one. Strike 1 Strike 2 - kids Apple juice. They water it down. Seriously I'm not kidding. (Picture included). I water my kid's down so I know what that tastes like. I asked the waitress and she acted like I was crazy but still brought me a new one which amazingly tasted like apple juice. If you're cutting corners watering down Apple juice then I don't want to know what else you're doing.  Strike 3 - the food. Oh my god if I wanted a handful of crushed tostitoes and Costco salsa I could have made my own lunch. The boys cheeseburger was basically one patty placed in the middle of 2 slider buns. My baby eats everything and he spit it out on the floor. I tried it. It was the worst burger. No seasoning. Dry. Disgusting. It really upsets me when restaurants treat kids like shit by making them shitty food because they probably won't complain about it. My shrimp tacos was were cold.  Strike 4 - the giant pile of dust on the ledge behind me. Don't tell me that happened overnight.  Overall we will never be back. It's really sad because the Brea location is great.

To be fair the food is good but I'm not going to patronize a restaurant where I'm treated like crap by the waitresses who think that just because they're young and cute that they can give horrible service.  They  are very disingenuous. There are couple of veteran waitresses Who are pretty good and polite but why in the hell does it take 10 minutes for a waitress to get change? Maybe she thinks the longer she makes you wait you will just forget about it and not need any change.  It's very clear that most of the waitresses hate their jobs  and they need to stay in college.

Alyssa J.,"San Diego, CA",21,13,6,1.0,2/23/2016,"Unfortunately giving this place zero stars isn't an option. We had the most unfortunate dining experience last night, which is usually not the case in a BJs.  1) our waiter was brand new. I get that being new, you are probably going to be more nervous than most, but when I can barely hear you talking to me and you are standing less than a foot away from me, clearly you don't have the people skills to begin with to even be hired for the job. Not once did he smile or make eye contact with any one in our table. He just looked outright petrified. Oh. And he forgot to put in our appetizer. Then I asked for additional water,  that took him ten minutes to track down a water pitcher and bring it back.  2) manager that came over to apologize (about said missing appetizer) did what he needed to do to ""make face"" with the customer and remove it from our check. No biggie, but I got the impression that he does this all the time from his ""forced car salesman"" approach to talking to customers. Not bad, just annoying because it didn't come across as sincere or genuine concern for his guests experience.  3) when our food came out, the pizza was cold. The salads looked like a bowl of blue cheese dressing with some lettuce and tomatoes thrown on top. YUM. Of course by this time we were already annoyed and just wanted to eat and leave.  4) but you can't leave BJs without a pizzookie.  So our pizzookie came out. With two spoons. There were three of us. The server (not the newbie) said ""oh would you like me to bring you out a third spoon?""  Of course. Well, she disappeared into the abyss never to return with the third spoon. Ten minutes later we finally tracked down a third spoon so we could all actually enjoy our dessert without having to play musical spoons. The best part was watching about 6 staff members congregate together near one of the stations to ""hang out"" when we were trying to flag down someone to find us a spoon! Bottom line, it was a night of just comical errors because of a place who doesn't have their operations together. If you want a dining experience where your waiter only shows up three times (I really do think he may have been having a panic attack in the back because he was so scared of people), have someone different bring you your food cold (I think we had 5 different servers), and someone else entirely bring you your check (no clue where that guy came from), then this is the place for you.  If not, stay away.  And advice to management, your front of house needs help. You can have the best employees in the world (minus the ones who are scared to talk to people) but without the operational structure and processes to back them up, you are leaving them with no way to do their job effectively. And that's what your customers are going to see.  Our waiter never checked on us (he stopped back by to apologize about the appetizer again, and to run our card to pay), the servers just dropped our food and ran. Attention to detail and guest engagement goes a long way to make a good memorable experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-menifee?start=140

Honestly the service at this location is always slow but that night it went to a whole other level. Our first server Nick was honestly terrible. He was overwhelmed by the simplest tasks. He seemed nervous and kept fumbling his words. It took him 30 minutes just to get us water and another 15 to take our order. If we weren't so hungry that night we would have left. But it wasn't just with us, he was so bad that the table across from us got up and left without even touching their food. We were honestly amazed that the manager told us he was one of their better servers. Luckily Steven happened to walk by and saved our night. He immediately took over and took care of us. He was funny and fast and we ended up chatting the entire time we were there.

The manager never even came to apologize or try and do anything about it even after I already talked to him after waiting for ever for any help. Just crazy people go here     I just left and I am still hungry cause they never got the food right even the pizza they re did came back so gross and not even cooked. So I guess drive through in an out. Since I just wasted all my money at this place that straight robbed us.

As other reviews have noted that can be slow and forgetful, and I would emphasize they're too often downright rude. Talking with friends and family there has even been accusations of a waiter talking down to customers for ordering drinks because he himself didn't drink (his name was Andrew). I was at their opening when they were at their best, and I've only seen the quality of waiters and waitresses decline since.  The food quality is good, but there's other good food in the area. If you get them on a good day and they're kind to you then you'll get good food and a fine dining experience, but if you don't want to take a chance to be hassled, insulted, made to wait and forced to leave angry, then choose something else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-menifee?start=140

Melissa C.,"Murrieta, CA",112,19,29,1.0,12/6/2015,"What was supposed to be a nice family dinner turned out to be a joke. Our server was polite, however, he was a bit absent-minded. Started out without silverware, which was the hostesses job, and had to ask for them again 30 minutes later when our calamari appetizer arrived. We were glad to place our order quick, but after asking twice about when we will be getting our appetizer and forgetting to check on it, 30 minutes was way too long for calamari to come out. The reason, according to our server, was that they weren't sure if HE will be bringing out the appetizer, or if the MANAGER was going to bring it out. So it was just sitting there, getting cold, waiting for someone to take it? That doesn't make sense to me.  During this time, we noticed the couple sitting next to us... waiting. Not sure if our server was their server, but no one ever came by to say hi or ask for their drinks. I felt bad for them as they constantly were looking around to see if someone was going to acknowledge them. I don't even think they knew who their server was. They ended up leaving. Not sure if they spoke to a manager, but they were pretty upset. We were also considering just getting up to leave, even though we had already placed our order. Finally our food comes 20 minutes later. We ordered 2 seared ahi salads, a small pizza, and a holiday pairing. The salads had no dressings - had to flag someone down to get us dressing, which ultimately delayed us longer in trying to have a decent dinner. On top of that, both the pizza and the holiday pairing entree were less than warm. The pan that the pizza was baked in was cool to the touch. We explained to our server these little discrepancies and apologized, saying he will speak to a manager to see if there was anything they will be able to do. We were hoping he would speak to the manager, but we think he forgot that too. Our big ticket came out to $94 with a ""tip."" We've been here numerous times and this is by far the worst experience we've had as a family. And don't use ""defiantly"" in your responses to people's yelp reviews.

Cindy W.,"Carlsbad, CA",2235,1958,4356,2.0,8/2/2013,"I'm here a lot because I like to try all the dishes at this place and the menu is big. Also because my husband likes the craft beers here. Tonight we came here for a family dinner like our usual Friday and we were seated immediately due to calling ahead.  Our waitress came and took our drinks order and appetizer. It took awhile for us to get our drinks and our appetizer, over 15 minutes wait for drinks? Strike 1.  Our appetizer came, we ordered the avocado egg rolls but didn't have utensils or plates so we had to flag our waitress down and by this point, our daughter has already eaten half of the egg rolls with her hands. Strike 2.  We put in our order for our entrees, which again took awhile. We looked around and it wasn't as busy as it normally is so I was wondering what was taking so long. Our dishes came out and my husband didn't have ketchup for his fries and my daughter's plate didn't include the applesauce we ordered. Again, it took awhile to flag down our waitress to get that in. Strike 3.  My husband finished his margarita and realized our waitress didn't give him water like we normally get when we are here. It's automatic to get water along with your drink so again we had to flag down our waitress for water and noticed she was in the back wall chatting with a few waitresses. It took her awhile to notice us and it took her over 10 minutes to come out with the water. Strike 4.  When we asked for the check and boxes, we didn't get a bag to carry all the boxes since we have an infant and a toddler to carry out, you would think she'd include a bag for easier carrying but she didn't. Strike 5.  We tipped her 12% instead of our usual 20% to waitresses. 12% for doing nothing. Not a bad way to make money. We were going to order the new white chocolate raspberry pizookie because a part of that goes to charity whenever you order s pizookie. But we were so fed up with our waitress that we skipped dessert.  If the service keeps up like this, BJs will lose their loyal customers because now we're questioning if we even want to come back anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-menifee?start=160

The place was empty. 2) Attempted to seat us in a bad spot, in a small table in the way, despite the place being empty. 3) We picked a good booth out of the way with enough room. However they put a family next to us with a kid that hit me in the shoulder while playing. Remember the place was empty so why did they seat a family next to us? Incredible! 4) The food was good but expensive. Paid $56 for two people. 5) Asked to pay the bill while my friend was in the bathroom. So instead of taking the money and ringing me up she cleaned the table and took plates away that were not finished. By the time she came back, minutes later, my friend had returned from the bathroom.  Pros:  1) The food was good. 2) The place was clean. 3) Started out empty but filled up quickly with a good mix of people.

While visiting a friend here in Menifee , she recommended we meet up here.... sounds great! I enjoy the vibe and food here. My friend arrived 15min earlier than me . As I sat down and spoke for about 15min , I realized nobody had came by to greet me. She had said that she had not seen her since she first arrived. .. what?! Almost 25-30 min?!! First we opened our silverware from their rolled up linen napkins. Yuck , both our silverware had dirty food/water spots from tip to bottom.  Then the linen napkin looked as though it had been used by the customers prior to us arrival.  GROSS! I EMEDITLY got STEPHANIE, our waitresses attention and requested paper napkins & plastic utensils. ... DON'T EVER EAT WITH DIRTY UTENSILS.  BIG HEALTH HAZARDS.  GOOGLE IT. We Emeditly ordered the  oven roasted brussel sprouts as a appatizer. Our entrées  were Salmon Ceasar salad & bunless portobello mushroom cheeseburger well done. First the brussel sprouts were soggy/looked & tasted as though they boiled them quickly /and stuck them in the oven to give them the roasted color. After 1 bite we both agreed to NOT to continue eating them. Asked to have them taken off our check... No problem  Second the salmon salad.  After the 3 or 4 bites she had a mouthful of 1/2 frozen /raw salmon. Yuck! Absolutely disgusting ! She literal started to gag at the table. DOUBLE YUCK! My well done hamburger that i had requested was medium /very pink. Called manager over named CHRIS , emeditly he started to make excuses after excuse why our order was NOT prepared properly. We just asked to have everything removed from our table.  As we were sitting there trying to process everything the 2 ladies next to our both got our attention to say that their utensils were also fithy. What is going on!?

Jia S.,"Temecula, CA",1,70,210,3.0,8/13/2016,The hostess called to seat us. The table wasn't ready so we had to wait back outside. Finally we got a table after 30 mins of waiting even though we were told the wait was only for 15 mins. The hostess walked past us with another group of guest and pretty much ended up being sent back to wait some more cuz the table was not ready either. They should make sure the table is ready to go before they call the guests up. So they won't have to walk to the table only to be walked back to wait some more. Food here is awesome though!

Our server was great which was not the problem, but my california chicken club sandwich literally made me sick. I don't think the chicken was cooked all the way which caused me to run off to the bathroom in the restaurant because I could no longer keep it down.

Donna O.,"North Charleroi, PA",1,7,1,1.0,3/31/2017,We waited about 50 minutes to be seated.   1. The waiter did not bring all the waters that were ordered. 2. They brought out the appetizer and the boneless wings were not cooked and raw. My niece bit into one and just about thru up. Had to run to the bathroom to wash out her mouth.  We told the waiter and he got the manager who comped the appetizer.  3.  They brought out the dinners and again many things were wrong. My Brussels sprouts were raw. My nephews Brussels sprouts were from the bottom of the Ian and burnt. Asked for new veggies and they came out cold and raw as well.  4. Not once during  dinner did the manager come back to see if the rest of our dinners were ok.  5. Not once during dinner did the wait staff offer more drinks or refill the water.  6.  Then we ordered desert and waited another 25 minutes  to receive again more wrong orders and still the manager never came by. I finally got up and went to the front and asked to speak to the manager who did not fix the issues.  I can see having one issue sometimes but everything with every dinner in our party. Needless to say we will no longer eat at that restaurant. We were from out of town visiting my nephew and his family who frequented this particular restaurant and they said they will not return again.  I certainly hope their corporate office gets this. I'm leaving my email and would hope they reach out and do something for my nephew who bought us dinner.

Amanda P.,"Hemet, CA",0,17,6,2.0,6/29/2015,"Let me say first, that this place has great food. The server was excellent and we recieved our food quickly. I wanted to get that out of the way because the reason for my 2 star review may not affect most people I called ahead because I was taking my mother for her birthday. I told them #1. That she was disabled, unable to speak, and would be in a wheelchair. #2. That it was her birthday. I asked if they had anything special for birthdays and was told that they had a birthday pizookie. I said ""Oh! That would be perfect. Thank you."" and told them when we would be there.  So, when I get there, we have to squeeze through the aisles to get to our table and we have quite a bit of difficulty getting her to a place where she can sit because the aisles aren't wide enough (I specifically asked about this when I called). Then when she has to go to the restroom I realize that they're up stairs. The only ""accessible"" access to the restrooms is up a ramp to the bar area where we again had to squeeze through (apologizing to all of the customers who had to scoot in and squeeze themselves against the tables and bars) to try and get to the restrooms--then again on the way back.

I ordered a cheeseburger and they brought me a hamburger. When I asked for cheese they took so long to bring it that the rest of my family was finishing their food and mine was cold by the time I got the cheese. They brought a quarter of a slice of cheese on a small plate and gave it to me. One star for being a clean place with lots of options. One star for the fries.

Beatriz M.,"Menifee, CA",57,24,8,1.0,2/25/2017,"So once again we decide to have dinner at BJ's even though it was a busy Friday night. Upon arrival we were given a 45 minute wait time, no big deal we want the food. We waited about an hour before being seated. The restaurant was busy and there were a few large parties. We got seated in a booth and a party of about 20 were seated in tables right through the middle. We ordered our food and got our appetizers out about 15 minutes after ordering. We got no plates, no utensils, and no napkins. Our server came by and we asked for those things. We got napkins, a few minutes later plates and 2 place settings. By the time we had received the plates we were almost done with our appetizer platter which were not very warm. about 10 minutes later we finally got our food. I ordered the barbacoa cauliflower pita tacos with bistro seasonal veggies, something new I decided to try. The rest of my family was  given their dinner and I got a plate with what I thought were the seasonal veggies. It was a plate with rice, couscous, spinach and a bunch of mushroom. I don't like mushrooms so I ate some of the couscous, rice and spinach. I then waited for my tacos. The waitress didn't come by too often so when she finally came by, (my family was almost done eating) I asked for my tacos her reply was ""Oh no! I should have been paying better attention. They brought you out the wrong meal. Do you still want the tacos?"" Of course I still wanted the tacos, In the meantime my husband ordered another beer so I wouldn't be sitting with food by myself since him and our 2 girl's were done eating. About 15 minutes passed and I still didn't have any tacos, my husband didn't even want the beer he had ordered and my girls were all done and I was upset and decided I did not want the tacos anymore. I got up and found our server because by this time she had not come back to check on us or to let us know my food would be out soon. Once I found her I let her know that I did not want the tacos anymore. She kept asking ""Are you sure? They will be right out."" I said no and my husband asked for the check so we could go. Now it took a while to get the check because she had to go find someone to take the tacos off my order. When we finally got the check she said she was going to give me the tacos anyway since they were already made and she wasn't going to charge us for them.Made me feel a bit better that she acknowledged the wrong. She gave us a bag with the food and off we went. Before heading home we made a stop and gamestop. Once we got home I thought ""Ok let me see if these pita tacos are any good."" I opened up the bag and the food box and to my surprise It was not even the food I had ordered. I was given the vegetarian pita tacos which I had no interest in. At that point I got a bit upset all over again because had I waited for the food to come and sat and ate it at the restaurant I would have had the wrong order. I was so wanting to try the cauliflower pita and so disappointed in the way the whole evening went. I felt like maybe the server got caught up in serving the 20 person party and our table was very forgotten. I get the fact that she was probably going to make a good tip off of that table but our $63 tab (after taking the pitas off the bill) would have been bigger had we had better service.

Wow.. but wait, there is more.. their beer selection is extensive and of great variety! So whether you are on a liquid diet or an insatiable appetite this place will not disappoint.

Veronica R.,"Murrieta, CA",3,23,1,2.0,3/6/2015,"I have been to this BJ'S plenty of times and I agree with a few others that the service is hit or miss. The food is always good which is why I didn't give this place one star, however, if you EVER need to bring your service animal with you, be prepared to get the stink face if you are greated by Holly.  Today I came to have lunch and brought my service dog, as I always do, not only did I get a dirty look as I walked in, but Holly was extremely rude. She told me I would have to wait to be seated as it was a ""Friday"" and people with reservations were coming in, it was 3 o'clock in the afternoon, the place was not busy at all. I asked her to provide a table that could accommodate my dog and again, she was rude and gave me dirty looks. I felt completely unwanted and felt as if I were doing something wrong. My dog is a service dog, not someone's pet that runs around acting like a maniac, he is VERY well mannered.  I didn't complain and I wasn't rude, I simply waited to be seated.  Once seated, I was greeted by two servers who were actually great and they were the reason I didn't ask for a manager. However, BJ'S really needs to consider who they choose to have greet people when they walk in the door, as they set the first impression of the place. Definitely not happy with Holly!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-menifee?start=200

Anna R.,"Menifee, CA",100,361,1251,5.0,5/7/2014,"Ok I'm giving this place 5 stars because in my book a business should get points for addressing an issue that seems to have been a common theme. This place  has great food and supports their community. First, i have had similar experiences at this restaurant with my family. I have twin daughters who get hungry and I have had the server completely ignore us on several occasions in the past. I vowed never to go back but, hey I'm not a fan of chain restaurants in general but BJs is one of my favorites overall besides Cheesecake Factory. I recently went in with a girlfriend for lunch and our server was amazing she had our drinks filled, was on top of our order and in the end she worked with us on sponsoring our soccer team and fundraiser. Wow! She was awesome.  The food is good. The avocado rolls are one of my all time favorite dishes anywhere. So if you want good tasting food with a huge selection of dishes and not to mention the drink selection is amazing! I failed to mention on one of our previous visits where we had slow service the manager came to our table and comped or meal so at least they are making efforts to rectify the problem. I agree there was a problem but it seems they have taken steps to change and in a great way! Our family and our soccer team will be back.

It takes 10 mins before our serve finally greets us so when she does i notice the fact that she has her cell phone hanging out of her pocket on at that so she takes our Order and we get out drinks I was not happy with my beer at all it didn't taste right so than we get our appetizers and the cheese dip is cold and clumpy and he fried asparagus is dripping grease  off it and. I suck it up hoping they will redeem them self with the entrée portion.but nope the failed at that to my New Orleans jambalaya dish might as well been you want chicken with your Cajun seasoning and dried rice for a side. And it didn't help the fact that our sever had lack of service skills.

We were sat down and handed menus! To start it all off the waitress did not come for at least 10 min to get our drink order in l. so sitting for 25 min with nothing to drink is a little absurd! We get our drinks and put in for appetizers and that came out decent! Food order is now in! Soups and salads took another ridiculous amount of time to come out! Soup was cold and had hard pieces of something in it! At this time a few of us only ordered soup and salad so everyone else is waiting for their food! I felt bad for the waitress she was trying but kept telling us it's the pizza well after about 40 min they finally bring out the rest of the dinners and to our surprise( not really)the food was cold! I would go to a different location! It is not fun sitting at a table with hungry kids! Once we expressed our concern about the cold food it was removed off the bill! The manager came over to talk to us but at this time it's just a dull dinner now! Brought out Birthday Pazooki no singing nothing!

Hello, if there's food on my fork and I'm in the process of lifting said fork to my mouth, this might be a clue that your question is a bit premature. So rude, but typical of your average chain restaurant whose only concern is to turn tables as quickly as possible.

C W.,"Sun City, CA",0,80,23,4.0,3/5/2015,"We eat here regularly & believe it to be one of the better restaurants in town.  This time we did the call ahead seating (Highly recommended on Thurs-Sat) There was a huge line outside but when we checked in with the hostess she said we were 10th out of 30 on the list (was only a 12 minute wait for us).  The rib-eye steak & salmon were perfectly cooked, (all seafood here is fresh not frozen). The Pizookie is a must for desert. My favorite is the white chocolate macadamia nut with 2 scoops of rich & creamy vanilla bean ice-cream on top. We were celebrating my daughter's B-day so it was free.   If your going to eat here on & off recommend you join the rewards club (might as well get the perks) Points add up fast an are redeemable for free food or $$$ off meals .   My only negative is the place is a bit loud, which is no prob for beer pizza and a few friends or a family dinner, but would not be good if your looking for a quiet intimate meal. There are lots of screens to watch your fav sport event on & they have a full bar with much to choose from.  You can also order wine by the glass or bottle & they will happily cork what you don't finish.  They have many different draft beers to choose form as well as some nice local bottled stuff.  In all a great place to enjoy a good meal",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-menifee?start=220

Louie A.,"Menifee, CA",134,147,1389,4.0,3/24/2013,"We been to this location several times now and food is always good.   Other than their popular pizzas and beer there are other food items on their menu that are pretty darn good.  The first would be the Clam Chowder in the bread bowl. The sour dough bread itself is toasted and every bite is savory.  I have had this several times in the past and would not get tired of ordering it.  It's just a great meal for a cold night out.   Another one of my favorites is the Gumbo Stew.  A little spicy but it is flavorful, the spice level is just a notch below medium and tolerable for anyone that does not in favor of spicy foods.  Pizzas are definitely their signature dishes from pan to thin crust you can't go wrong ordering them here.  When new pizzas hit the menu we almost always order them.  As far as the staff, most are super friendly and very attentive but you can't fault them if they are  busy which most BJ's are on any given night.  So be patient and it all works out in your favor.  There's this one time they gave me the wrong drink and just comped it for making an error.

Kim C.,"Murrieta, CA",72,80,45,2.0,7/19/2015,"Unfortunately, this review is based mostly on our experience and very little on the food.  Last night we went to this BJ's with a couple friends. I called ahead with a party of 6 and a high chair. We were told on the phone there was no wait so we left right away and headed over to the restaurant. We got there and there was a 15 minute wait. Not a big deal really. The hostess was very friendly and kept us updated on the status of our table. Once the table was ready, they walked us back to our table. As we walked further and further back in the restaurant it got hotter and muggier. It was raining outside and humid, but still was no excuse for just how hot the restaurant was in the area we were seated. When our waitress came over, we mentioned that it was hot. She said customers had been complaining all day and she had told her manager. But, she apologized because she was warm too.  We were sat in a large booth so to add to the hot environment, we were now sitting elbow to elbow. My son had to use the bathroom, so as I walked him to the front I asked the hostess if the manager was available. She was standing right there by the takeout area so I approached her. She was talking to someone so I waited and when she finished talking she looked at me and began to walk away. I said excuse me and got her attention. I told her how warm it was in the back and she rolled her eyes and said the temperature was reading between 70 and 72 so there wasn't much she could do. She said it was hot outside (it was not, it was between 7 and 8 o clock and raining) so the inside temp would be warmer. I explained what the waitress had said and how they were hot too and she said she would lower the air but gave me a nice side of attitude. By the time my son and I got back to our table it was much cooler. Later in our meal, my son had to go to the bathroom again ((typical 3 year old)) and I walked right by the manager. She looked and me and walked away. She didn't ask if it was any better, she never came by our table, nothing!! She was the rudest manager I have ever dealt with.  Overall our food was good. That's the only reason I gave 2 stars.

The rolls were lukewarm, kinda soggy whilst the pasta was dried all around the edges. The pasta was not yet cooked or el dente, in fact parts still raw and clumped together hard to chew. It's hard to screw up pasta. No parmesean on top and had to call waitress to ask for parmesean as it was a lacking flavor. Although our server was super nice and sweet we were disappointed that she forgot about us, I shouldn't have tipped her much. Can't say we will ever come back, unfortunate as I love the atmosphere and there is nowhere to go to like it around there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-menifee?start=240

Crusader ..,"Menifee, CA",21,73,77,3.0,2/9/2015,"I admit my elderly mom and I are very particular when eating out, and this was the first ever visit we made at this establishment the other day (during lunchtime). PROS: 1) We managed to get a nearly private booth away from the hustle and bustle of the other rather noisy restaurant; 2) It seemed like we literally had two servers and they constantly checked on us, were prompt with our requests, and both were very attentive to our needs; 3) The veggie pizza on the super thick crust was very unique and I enjoyed it very much;   4) My mom had the unlimited soup and salad, which is a great value, and she was able to take home the portions she couldn't finish; 5) The double chocolate chip ice cream with whipped cream really hit the spot. Didn't think the other desserts (some as high as 1800 calories) would have been a good idea. CONS: 1) My silverware was covered with very white spots and I asked and received a replacement set promptly. Also, there were no condiments whatsoever on our table; 2) I requested Large Print menus for both my mother and I, but they only claimed to have ONE (which looks like they print on an in-house printer), so we had to share that one menu, which sucks; 3) It wasn't super crowded, but the music (depending on the song) was louder than my elderly mom and I would have liked;  3) When I asked for ""extra napkins"" (they provide cloth napkins with the silverware), the server brings some Mickey Mouse cocktail napkins, which was a crock. I cannot imagine they do not have regular-sized paper napkins for using with messier menu items; 4) Despite the decent service, the servers did not do a good job explaining to newbies about the menu, explaining the ""unlimited soup/salad"" more clearly, explaining drink choices clearly (which really confused my mom). We were aggravated with the servers not communicating better with us, but they weren't horrific servers by any means.

And the place was busy so I expected to wait. No problem. When we got our table after a very short wait I was happy till I saw the table very small and I am not a small guy. We asked for water twice before getting any. We ordered our appetizer and a salad. The waiter asked if we wanted the salad at the same time or after we said after. Guess the word did not get back to the kitchen because another waitress brought the salad out first then he brought the appetizer. When he saw the salad he asked if it was ok. Because we did not want a soggy salad we did not send it back. So now the table is very full with all the dishes coming out of order. I spilled my drink when reaching for a napkin. A waiter on the table next to us acted like she did not see. I got up and began wiping the table with paper napkins another waitress walked by looked and walked away without a word. I called her back and asked for help and she said she would go find our waiter. He did return but had to go back to the wait station to get some towels. My guess is the female waitress did not inform him of the issue. Are they a team or working against each other?  When he returned he began wiping down the small bench seat, the floor and next he began to wipe the table with the same rag. I stopped him and he told me it was ok because he flipped the rag over for the table. ??? Is this how they are trained??? I then told him we are moving to another table and he replied by giving us permission to move. Really I did not need his permission we were moving. He did not bother to apologize for his actions. Guess it is normal to mop tables and wipe the floor. After all this no offer to comp anything. In fact had to ask for another ice tea. The food was good and price was fair so I did not mind paying for it. We used a gift card to pay for most of it and the waiter made the comment that is was good we were able to use a gift card and joked about ""at least you got a bigger table.""

Aaron H.,"Corona, CA",0,6,,2.0,12/11/2015,"I have been to many BJ's restaurants.  By far the WORST service I have ever received at any location.  Order was wrong, incorrect drinks served.  Had about 4 different people serving us so I figured it was because of that.  I didn't complain because I didn't think that anything would come of it.  Was given dirty silverware and dirty plates.  I ordered a small pizza with pepperoni and olives.  I received a small pizza with sausage, onions, olives, and one pepperoni.  LOL.   During our first round of drinks, I ordered a blonde and my friend ordered a Crown and Coke.  The second round we ordered two blondes.  We received a blonde and a Crown and Coke.  When we told the server she apologized, gave him the Crown and Coke and never brought the beer that was ordered even though we said it was still wanted.   I have friends that live off Newport and they have all commented on how TERRIBLE the service is at this location.  We experienced it first hand.   Will I go back to BJ's?  Yes.  Will I go back to this location?  No.   PROCEED WITH CAUTION.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-menifee?start=300

Pamela W.,"Menifee, CA",275,87,35,1.0,7/26/2013,"My first experience I was kind of disappointed! The service was bad and my salad was wilted and pizza was bland! Asked several times for service and it seemed like we were ignored! Finally the busboy helped us.  Lively place for a Sunday at 5! Parking is difficult!  My niece wanted to celebrate her Birthday dinner there, so my second attempt was another horrible experience, this time a nightmare! The waiter seemed to have WAY too many energy drinks and couldn't really focus on what we really wanted! I need to order Gluten free foods, and thought I was getting what I ordered as gluten free, but it was full of gluten! I was given a gluten free menu after the fact. Shocked as to why the waiter, being there since they opened was NOT aware or cared to give me a gluten free menu. He also messed up on my parties orders, or was it the cook? I also will add the drinks were full of ice and watered down. We had to wait quiet awhile for our food, and when we finally got it 5 people out of my party said their order was totally wrong!                                                               ~~~~ To be honest I rather poke my eyes out, then to step foot in that messed up establishment! Get your sh** together BJ's! PS ... The manager tried to make it right, but to be honest by then, the Birthday Dinner was a disaster!  Maybe a third time is a charm?

We had to wait for our server to go home before the new server brought us booster seats.  The first server put lemon in my water which is a pet peeve of mine. I do not want dirty leomon peels to my water which is why i do not ask for it.  When the food came, we had to request ketchup, and steak sauce. I ordered dessert for the kids which has still not arrived. When the adult desert has arrived and now the kids are eating their dessert because of course its sweet and looks good and they I don't have any.

She smugly asked us how many and when we told her we were bar seating, said ""ok"" and let us go on our way. We seemed to have inconvenience her somehow.

Previous to this one, the dining experience in Oxnard was just the same as this one. It took at least 15 minutes for our waiter to come to our table after a quick 'hi be right back'. He blamed the wait on a number of events. After he returned and drink orders were placed another substantial length of time passed until drinks arrived, we immediately decided to place our appetizer and dinner orders. 45-50 minutes passed before we saw our food orders. Our drinks ran low and waters out, our friend who was with us had to flag our waiter down for water as he had not returned to check on us at all since order placement. We were so starving we started eating the appetizers like savages when they arrived and then another server delivered the dinners immediately after appetizers, probably 3 minutes later-my boyfriend laughed! We also realized at this time our daughters fruit appetizer suggested by the waiter was forgotten. Did not want to mention it for fear of more waiting. My boyfriend said the food was good once it got there, miy meal wasn't too great though.  Side note, the table behind us was left dirty the entire duration of our visit.

LeAnn R.,"Murrieta, CA",0,28,2,1.0,11/9/2013,"MAJOR LET DOWN!!  I'm usually head over heels for the BJs brewery chain, however this particular one I won't ever be going back to, unless of course, they change management altogether.  My aunt and I went here and ordered the mahi mahi -- we both ordered exactly the same thing and got two entirely different dishes. Seriously? And when I told the server, she was gracious enough to bring me another bowl of rice- but is that the only fix to this? Management- bad call! Not to mention they must have been under staffed because we never got our drinks in a timely manner. (We waited 20 minutes for a champagne split and we were IN the bar when it was practically empty.)  Again, I went with my significant other and ordered pizza, the food was decent but we waited 30 minutes for our salad appetizers.  Not impressed. (We didn't order drinks- mostly because last time was a terrible wait.) At this point I was willing to give them another chance (as I've said, usually huge fan of the chain) but I've heard horror stories since my last visit! Apparently if you're with a party of five and you're seated, order food, and are patiently awaiting your meal - and a scheduled party of 20 walks in - you'll be eating burnt pizza, under cooked pizza, and you'll be expected to wait an hour and a half for it! Not to mention the manager will come to your table -- but don't expect an apology!  This store brings the BJs legacy to shame. Pazookis and root beer lovers deserve better!!

Also, half the time you have a custom request on your order, they don't get it right.  I like their beer and their ""guest"" beer selections. They have really good pizza, and I'm not one to be impressed with pizza very often. They have a great menu selection, even for those looking for healthier options.

Cory G.,"Murrieta, CA",3,147,8,1.0,9/15/2012,"I really wanted to like this location, as I am a big fan of BJ's (I gave the Temecula location 5 stars) but this BJ's felt like it was on the Moon it was so different.  This part isn't that big of a deal, but the waiters/waitresses were all very awkward. They seemed timid, didn't communicate very well (if at all), and just overall a very awkward feeling. I've never seen anything like it at any other restaurant I've ever been to before. It's not a big deal though, what BJ's really needs to get right is the food... Now the food...I had 3 different items and all 3 were terrible.  1) Mozzarella sticks - Appetizer - Now the mozzarella sticks were the best part of the meal, but unfortunately there was a black hair stuck in the cheese on mine. I don't have black hair. Other people have left reviews here that say they too had hair in their food, so with that in mind 1/5 stars. 2) ""Southern Fried Chicken"" - Entree - aka Country Fried Steak etc. - This was a lunch special, but I was expecting so much more. The piece of chicken was SMALL (I'm talking maybe 3-4 bites and that was it) and had very very little gravy on it. The mashed potatoes were bland, no flavor to them at all, The corn had no taste. This is the worst country fried steak I've ever had, and I've had most all of them (even from places like Denny's, which is sadly higher quality than BJ's). Very dissapointing, 1/5 stars 3) My wife got the Santa Fe salad, and since she is vegetarian had the chicken put on the side so I could eat it (which was nice, because I was still hungry after finishing my tiny entree). The piece of chicken was way overcooked, I'm talking as hard as a brick. I could barely saw through it with a knife. It was a jawbreaker, and it was extremely salty. Not to mention it was small, probably about 3 inches long by 1 inch wide and very thin. That was it. Small, overcooked, salty piece of chicken. Sad, at the point of being pathetic. 1/5 stars. Everything across the board was just bad, and coupled with awkward service made it a strange experience that I don't plan on ever having again. I've gone to the BJ's in Temecula about 15 times, and it is a 5 star experience. I don't know how this location could have turned out so badly. Oh well, I have enough money on my BJ's premium card now to get a free pizookie, which I will be gladly enjoying at the Temecula location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-menifee?start=400

Now the good stuff:  The food was pretty delicious.  I really enjoyed what I had (the chicken marsala) in spite of the fact that the fettuccini was hard.  The sauce was delicious, the chicken was moist, the green beans were tasty, and there was plenty of food.  Everyone enjoyed their food, pretty much, although there were a couple of things that were not prepared as requested.   The manager comped us dessert to make up for some of the issues.  Pizookie is our friend.

Visited the one in Menifee, since we recently moved there, and expected a very nice time and food. Not to be at all. The place was 40% full, but for our table of 5 it took so long to get things started, it seemed like we were in a very crowded restaurant. Each thing we tried to order, starting with appetizers, later with main dishes, as well as beer, coffee and drinks, took a very long time. BJ's is known for their Chicago style Pizza. One could assume, incorrectly, that by now they have the preparation method, amounts and temperature down to a science. After all, it does not take a lot of skill to make a pizza from scratch, specially if recipes has been passed down from corporate headquarters.  We had appetizers, all average, like Avocado Egg Rolls, Chicken Wings, Sliders, each priced for high enough numbers to merit skillful preparation. They took their very sweet time, and the coffee besides being lukewarm did not return for at least 45 minutes. Pizzas were the biggest fiasco. Arrived lukewarm, with such a careless preparation, that frankly, I felt like pushing my way into the kitchen to try and help them out. How can a place that is known for their pizza, send to the table such a dismal failure. Service by a very pretty waitress was way below what was needed, long intervals left looking at each other, should we just walk out the same way we came in?

We sat there and ate our meals with all our other dirty dishes on our table our waitress said she would ""get someone to move them for us"". No one ever came.  The next time we ate there was for our cousins birthday. Our appetizer came out n decent timing fallowed by our salads. Then we waited over an hour for our meals. when they finally came the blood on the plate with the stake on it was dried from sitting under the heat lamps: as more of the food came out it all had that problem. Each dish came as least 10 minutes apart. We asked to talk to someone about the problems; 25 minutes later a ""manager in training"" came to our table, she said that all our food would be remade. In the 30 minutes of our crappy food coming out, one of the plates never made it. when the remade food came out it was ok-ish. My chicken wasn't cooked all the way. The missing plate from before came out maybe 10 minute later. We were offered a dessert after waiting 35 minutes for it we left. They did comp our whole ticket. They said they were under staffed, but it was the week on fathers day and graduations... they should have known to have more staff. Not sure if I will try them again.

They did take his whole plate back, cooked the stake a bit longer, still pink, and brought back on the same plate with blood still on potatoes and veggies...was over it at that point.

Alfonso P.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/4/2015,"Bad kitchen. Trash talk among staff in the parking lot. Management said she was new, and there is evidence of a lack of communication between the kitchen and the servers. There doesn't seem to be a pride in the food, from the management or kitchen, at this particular location. That's a shame because i just moved to the area recently. I've had some good experiences at other BJs restaurants. Unfortunately, this one looks like a BJs but operates with lower standards and care than a tavern owned by two distant cousins whom inherited the place in a will and just want to sell it.  My date and i ordered a couple of drinks before our food showed up, which were nicely made. The appetizer was calamari.(cold, but ignored. It was just for me and my date was having a good time. I didn't want to divert good vibe.) My date had a salad with the salmon and qinoa. I ordered a large pizza, and they brought me a small and a medium that were hastely cut and prepared.  A new person brought them from the kitchen with an attitude, and said ""we're all out of large pizzas."" I laughed and asked if she was out of the pans, thinking a little open mindedly still.  She explained that their pre-prepaired dough for larges are all out, so they put the toppings on those two crusts. Which, looked like exactly what they did. Because the medium had more cheese and toppings than the small BY FAR. In fact, i took a couple of slices out when the manager came to question me and one slice was wet dough without even much cheese, and none of the toppings. I ate none of it. They were adamant on making the argument that they basically gave me more pounds of pizza. I told them that they underestimated the physics of a large pizza in contrast to a small. It cooks differently, and the product that they brought to me was not what i wanted. The ratio of dough to any other ingredient, was obvious on the small. Zero pride in the product of their kitchen. I paid for our drinks and everything else that we ordered in those 15 minutes. We took my dates salmon to go, and went somewhere else to enjoy our night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-menifee?start=440

Charlie C.,"Burbank, CA",3,432,,2.0,12/27/2014,"Nice looking place, with lots of room and lots of TVs. Waiters and waitresses were nice, but our service for dinner on the Friday after Christmas, though we understood why it was packed, was not the greatest.   And my food left a lot to be desired. If you go here, either go during the week or early on a weekend night.  It gets very crowded on the weekend and you will be lucky to make it into the parking lot off of Haun. Just way too crowded.  Luckily, we were early and hit a good light and made it in in relatively good time. Be patient. Four of us were seated. We ended up being served by at least three people.  And the young guy who's name was on the receipt at the end wasn't even the one that was presented to us at the start. He came at the end.  I hope he split the tip.  In fact, he never did introduce himself. Now, they were all nice, but we would have preferred one server. Our parent's wine took 20 minutes to be delivered. Our waitress said the bar always gets backed up.  Bad excuse. Alcohol is where restaurants make their biggest profits; excuses are unacceptable. I ordered the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi. Waitress said all the fish was excellent. Apparently someone forgot to tell the chef.  Way too dry, I needed a drink everytime I took a bite.  And way too many onions in the bed of rice pilaf that supported the fish. I would have chosen some pasta, but the menu was devoid of many options. The others liked their food, though nobody thought anything was excellent.  Best part of my meal was the double chocolate ice cream scoops.

The waitress came and took our drink order.  4 beers, 2 waters, and a gin and tonic.  It took 15 minutes to get our drinks.  We finally ordered 10 minutes later and waited another hour for our food which was full of numerous mistakes.  this meal overall took over 3 hours.   The manager needs to be fired or learn how to staff a restaurant because this has been my consistent experience now like 6 times.

AND ITS PINK!!!! Husband had beer. Ew. WHatever, he loved his beer, I do not partake in beer drinking. The kids loved their kid meals, their little kids menu was pretty extensive, and I was impressed, and they serve applesauce!!! WHAAAA? Big hit with the kiddies. My low fat, low cal dinner was very flavorful, and my husband sandwich and fries were great.

Leslie T.,"Hemet, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/6/2016,"I have spent years telling everyone how great BJs food is. Multiple visits to Mo Val and Temecula, and Torrance once with a larger group 10+. Food and service always has been excellent. I don't know what happened to the Menifee Haun location. Was there Monday evening went early to beat the crowd. We were seated right away server was quick to arrive and take drink and appetizer order. All good. Southwest eggrolls as always great. We order a rib eye and bread and the cherry chipotle salmon. Food arrives with no bread. Rib eye is cooked right but a bit grizzly. No fault it happens sometimes. The salmon is sorely lacking any kind of cherry chipotle anything; its served on couscous that is dripping wet with tomato flavored water and an assortment of asparagus spear sizes. While the thinner spears are perfect the nickel size spears are undercooked and the table is set with forks only. We flag down a server and I request additional sauce and where is the bread can that server handle this? No they will send our server. Now halfway through the meal the bread arrives and I'm told the sauce is being made and will be brought. Away she goes only for us to discover she has delivered bread with no butter whatsoever. Again we must flag a different server who of course again is unable to complete a simple task of bringing butter to the table and must again let our server know. Really? It probably wouldn't have been as annoying had I not watched her disappear then reappear in moments to congregate with 3 other girls at the reception desk and all stand around talking. Fast forward 3/4 thru the meal the butter is delivered. The sauce never did arrive and I can honestly say while properly cooked (not over or under cooked) the salmon was flavorless and the couscous a watery flavor disaster. In short completely lacking either cherry or chipotle flavor whatsoever. This location was a big let down for sure. I'll drive the extra distance to Temecula or Mo Val from now on. What happened to this location? Get the kitchen staff over to train these guys on the food prep and swap managers until the serving staff can be properly trained. 1 star for the quick seating, drink and appetizer order and delivery.

Servando B.,"Temecula, CA",0,7,1,1.0,4/15/2014,"I created a yelp account specifically to share my terrible experience here. My first experience at the menifee location (8 months ago approx) was terrible as far as the customer service but worse was the fact I got food poisoning from the food served. I told myself I would never return and they would never see another dollar from me. Well last night I wanted to take my parents out to eat at red robin and last minute they wanted bj's, I decided to give it another shot. The drinks took forever to arrive, my mothers iced tea was refilled about 15 minutes after her cup was empty. My mother and I both ordered pasta, our pasta plates arrived first and our garlic bread (part of the plate) arrived 10 minutes later only after I questioned our waiter about the location of our non existent garlic bread. This morning I wake up feeling sick and throw up as soon as I make it to my bathroom sink. I call my parents to say good morning and I find out my father has terrible diarrhea and my mother has been throwing up all night. This location needs to be investigated, there is either terrible food prep/cross contamination happening or the food being served is spoiled. I am disgusted by this location and will NEVER be returning to menifee bj's. I have never had issues at the Temecula location or  Moreno Valley location and it is terrible I have to drive past my local spot if I ever want to have bj's again.

N K.,"Ramona, CA",41,16,7,1.0,4/10/2014,So my family and I went here last weekend. We were told the wait would be 20 minutes. Since I have never eaten here before I checked the reviews and told my family this location has a lot of bad reviews and we will probably be here for a while to just get seated. They thought we should give them the benefit of the doubt and still try them. So the 20 minute wait turned into almost 45 minutes lots of people were coming out but no one was being seated. I was in a hurry since it was already late and I had over an hour drive home since I was visiting and had a tired baby with me so I already knew what I was ordering to get ahead start once we got seated. The waiter was very friendly and my review is by no means based on him. So we finally got seated and ordered right away it would have been nice if there were signs in the waiting area about the new ordering system about how you can order from your phone and get 20% off your bill why you wAit instead of having it on the tables when your already seated. Anyways my fiancé and dad figured since it was so busy and the reviews were bad that it would be safe to order a burger they both ordered medium rare. So the food came out and pretty quick for how busy it was and my fiancé took a bite of his and it was completely burnt no joke I mean it was hard as a rock just burnt. He was upset and told them to just take it back don't worry about bringing a new one. My dad started on his  since he got his last and same thing hard as a rock burnt. He asked for a new one. The manager came over and apologized and said he would get his order out right away. Let's just say that when someone has already been waiting almost an hour and a half to eat and you mess up the order it should be the first thing you cook and bring back out. Obviously this was not the case we all finished our meals and 30 minutes after they took the order back he finally got his after I had to waive down the waitress since the manager kept ignoring us trying to waive him down and call for him when he looked right at us and was less than five feet away. The waitress didn't even know what table to bring it to and was asking everyone in the room. The only reason they got a one star from me is the waiter was very nice and we kept telling him it wasn't his fault but he felt really bad. The manager didn't charge for one of the burgers but if I were him I would have comped both and the drinks. Trust the reviews they are dead on and this place really needs work. I saw one of the cooks outside and he just looked so stressed out and was talking bad about the place. I don't blame him maybe they are understaffed or just have a bad management to guide them but they should really get their stuff together some of the food was great some of it was alright but had potential to be better if it was cooked right. My appetizer was the goat cheese grilled veggie pizza and it was extremely soggy in the middle I have had this same pizza other places it is a flat bread pizza that is crispy and this just wasn't cooked all the way through but it was still good. I'm just disappointed that they couldn't even cook a burger oh and I forgot to mention the new burger that came out still wasn't cooked right a little less burnt but still way over done but at that point my dad was frustrated and just asked for a to go box and probably didn't even eat it when he got home but he didn't want to make a scene. He even told them about the second burger but still was charged and they didn't even offer to give him something else on the menu.

There is always at least 10 to 15 minutes between ordering appetizers and ordering food......somehow our appetizers always arrive at the same time or AFTER our entrees which is incredibly frusterating.

JESSE A.,"Sun City, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/1/2013,"Me and my wife went there to have dinner this past Friday.  We had heard many good things about the Temecula restaurant and figured we'd try this Menifee one out. Right from the entrance we were treated rudely and told to have a seat...where's the escort to w/c table ? Then when we got  seated we never got utensils/napkins. Food was finally brought to out table but still no utensils/napkins. Had to ask for them. Ordered a burger and was asked how I liked it cooked..well done or medium? My answer was well done. After cutting the burger in half my wife saw that it was still very red inside. I then called the server and mentioned my burger hasn't been cooked enough, so she went ahead and removed it to be recooked again. It took some time before my burger arrived, I was able to share my wife's salad while waiting. After a long wait and already got full off my wifes salad, I just asked for the check and decided not to have the burger anymore.  By that time we were no longer in the mood to continue waiting. Food looked and probably was good but service was poor, even though it was a Friday night, it wasn't super busy and there were more that enough workers I saw helping other customers. I wouldn't retun to this restaurant again and don't advise it, might be better to take the drive to the Temecula Restaurant instead.

I'll just start off with my first experience at this location: it was by boyfriends birthday (now this was within the same month they opened) the food was great, service was good, but once I got home, STOMACH PAINS. Not just me, but him and his mom too! The three of us all got food poisoning! After that time I've never had any MAJOR issues with their food other than it could be prepped a little nicer. But I hardly ever go to this location for food, if I want to go to BJ's, I usually always go to the temecula location because id much rather wait in traffic and wait another 10 minutes to be seated than eat at the one right down the street. Sadly, all my friends say they do the same thing!! Notice when you walk in it's never busy.... Wonder why? I only go to this location if I'm craving a pizookie and need one pronto! Though sometimes the pizookie isn't even cooked all the way (I've has this problem at other BJ's too) but I enjoy cookie dough, so it's alright with me! Oh and the mozzarella sticks are prime.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-menifee?start=520
Marie H.,"Hemet, CA",2,10,2,1.0,12/10/2013,"We have eaten at the BJ's in Temecula more times then I can even count.  We have visited the Menifee location a couple of times now, since it is closer to home for us.  I have to say my experience on Sunday was absolutely the worst service I have ever had from a restaurant in my entire life.  Prior to going I had heard from at least 4 people that it isn't worth the trip but we came to your establishment anyways.  First off after we ordered our drinks we had to ask twice for our beverages before we finally received them.  Then when my salad and my husbands burger arrived I was completely thrown off by how terrible the food looked.  I literally without exestuation  had seven cubes of turkey and three bits of bacon on my cobb salad and three handfuls of lettuce.  I asked for the dressing on the side since we were going to share and I had to ask twice for that before that came too. My husbands bison burger was so small and dry the only thing on it was the meat and one half of a green chili. He asked for the onions on the side an didn't even get those until after two times of asking.  Also we had to ask three different people for silverware before those came as well.  When I asked to speak to a manager about our meals they offered to bring out some more toppings for my salad but they said that is how the food comes now.  Which is unacceptable in my mind.  Then I gave the salad back.  At this point I would rather eat a Wendy's salad for a third of the price. My husband ate his pathetic burger because he was so hungry and after eating it he was still hungry.  The bread was so dry that he finished his drink and the waitress never came by again to see if he wanted more.  After my kids were finished we asked for our bill.  After 30 minutes we waited for the waitress to come back by and she said the manager was still trying to take the salad off of the check, which can't be a difficult thing to do. Then we asked to speak to the manager again and the waitress said that first manager we spoke to was the kitchen manager and not the other manager.  So when I asked to speak to him she said that she didn't know where he is and then I had to persuade her to try to find him.  Apparently he was taking care of a handful of other customers who were also complaining about the substandard food and service.  After a while he came to our table.  He said that he was sorry for the service and he would take the food bill off of our debit card.  I told him that we paid with a $25 gift card and$19.44 on the debit card and he said he would take care of the bill.  He also said that there have been a lot of cut back from corporate and that the entire staff is about 75% proficient but they just don't have anyone who really knows what they are doing.  He also said that the burger my husband ordered come premade so they can't fix that.  Which is gross.  If I wanted a premade burger I could go through a drive thru and pay $0.99 for a burger like that not $12.00.  So after everything I check my account today and what do I see.  A charge from BJ's for the $19.44.  Not only do you rob our family of a nice evening out, give us the most pathetic food, the worst service, warm drinks, I have to continuously ask for things over and over and over again which should be automatic, like silverware and now after the manager saying he is going to take care of everything I had to pay nearly $50 total for this terrible experience. If this is what Bj's is coming to then I can bet you won't be in business long. So here I am writing this letter because I am s frustrated and I can guess what is going to happen...Nothing!  Shame on you BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-menifee?start=520
J L.,"Temecula, CA",36,106,27,2.0,1/2/2013,"Gave this place a second shot. I'm going to give our waitress the benefit of the doubt and tell myself she was new. My dish came with rice, I asked if I could substitute brown rice instead, and she didn't know what that was so she offered me rice pilaf. She also didn't seem to know that my order came with a side of soup or salad, because she never asked me which I preferred. So I told her I'd like a wedge salad. 15 minutes later she comes back to our table and says ""Your entree comes with soup or salad which"" I told her, ""yes, I know I asked for a wedge salad."" on top of that our drinks were empty, she didn't remove our empty plates after our starter salads and appetizers before bringing out our entrees, which made for a VERY crowded table. Another person at our table ordered a burger with NO pickles, the burger came and it looked like it had extra pickles. My rice that came with my salmon was old and very dried out. It tasted like my plate had been sitting out for a good hour before it was brought to my table. it was also luke warm, which was not appetizing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-menifee?start=520
Fred B.,"Riverside, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/7/2014,"Thank you BJ's for one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. Sitting for over an hour waiting for my food and then being told that my appetizer wasn't coming was just great. Hearing the guy behind complain that he found something in his food made it even better. But the real kicker was the quality of the food, tough and dry. Just perfect. Now I'm just waiting for the check so I can get out of here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-menifee?start=520
Lorin M.,"Sun City, CA",14,3,,1.0,7/31/2014,"I gave three chances before reviewing. Food is good but service is mediocre. I always go in the afternoon when its slow, but even then, servers are invisible. The first time I had to finally ask when my salad would be ready as it had already been 20 minutes (I could tell by the time stamp on a text I sent right after I ordered.). It finally came with my entree. The second time my server never checked on me and I finally asked a busboy for a soda refill. Today I waited again for my starter salad and was taking my second bite when my pasta arrived. That was the last I saw of my server until both empty plates and my empty glass were stacked at the edge of the table. My soda was empty for the last half of my meal. This will be the last chance I give them. I've been a server for approx. 20 years. My own customers must think I'm a stalker if this is now the normal standard of service. I always check on guests 2-3 times, and keeping drinks refilled is imperative. And when the restaurant is practically empty, there is no excuse for dismal service. Three chances is enough.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-menifee?start=520
Ryan M.,"Sun City, CA",0,2,1,1.0,8/25/2012,"Food is okay.. Wait staff is horrible, and can't get noticed or taken care of.. Hostesses are very helpful, and are almost forced to be apologetic for lacking service..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-menifee?start=520
Mandalyn M.,"Hemet, CA",0,13,5,1.0,9/24/2012,"I was so excited to have a BJ's open close to my house.  Went there last Saturday just to check it out....have a beer sampler and maybe an appetizer.  My boyfriend and I started with the calamari and 2 appetizer bites; the bruschetta and stuffed mushrooms.  The bruschetta and mushrooms were awesome!!  The calamari was just ok but it got worse when I found a hair fried into the calamari.  There were 3 bartendars of which really one was helpful; she took the calamari and asked if we wanted something else.  My boyfriend ordered the wonton bites and artichoke bites; of which we only received one of.....the artichoke bites (so good).  The service was so lack luster....if he didn't ask we would have never got the wontons, he ordered an ice tea.....never got it.  Then had to ask if the calamari was coming off the bill.  I have been in the service industry and if this happened to one of my customers I would have been mortified and so apologetic.  Honestly, I was so surprised that no one seemed horrified that there was a hair in my food nor at any time was there an apology.  Sooooooo DISAPPOINTED!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-menifee?start=520
David R.,"Winchester, CA",3,50,,1.0,1/19/2014,"We will not be going back to either BJ's location, Temecula or Menifee.  Like others have said, no napkin or silverware at the table.  Our waitress was ok.  I have two food complaints, and they are the reason we are finally finished with going to BJ's.  First, the Pizza.  We have really liked their deep dish pizza for a few years now, but the amount of sauce, next to none, and the very skimpy toppings have always kind of been a bummer.  We ordered a mini with sausage and mushrooms, and I think I saw one mushroom on the very last bite.  Again, there is basically no sauce, which is a bummer.  The final straw is the Tortilla soup.  I have lost 30 lbs. in the past 8 months, and one of the things I did to lose weight was eat their Tortilla soup instead of a big meal.  Had it at least once a week if not more, for a few months straight.  Over this period of time (Temecula location), I noticed the amount of broth getting smaller and smaller, to the point that I still have chips and avocado to eat, but no broth left to eat it with.  My wife began to notice the same thing, when she started to get the Tortilla soup with me, and we would share a stuffed Shroom appetizer.  This last time at the Menifee location, the amount of soup in the BOWL was pathetic.  I asked if we got the cup instead, and the waitress said no, the bowl, but she went back and charged us for a cup.  I am back on my weight loss program to lose my final 20 lbs. and will now have to go elsewhere for my soup once or twice a week.  Too bad, but a customer can only take so much, until they feel it is a slap in the face.  We hit that point, and are done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-menifee?start=520
Joey H.,"Los Angeles, CA",62,320,3,5.0,11/1/2012,"this location just opened recently and both of us were very happy about that. there are two reasons why we love BJ's. first reason, they have a gluten-free pizza. to my knowledge, i cant think of another pizza place that has that option for customers. second reason, we believe they have the best pizza. theres a place in L.A. that comes close, but BJ's is tops. we ordered over the phone, got in the car, drove there, parked (they have special parking for pick up), walked to the pick up desk, paid and were on our way home to enjoy. so easy, the only bad part was driving home smelling the pizza. she had the gluten-free, spinach and artichoke, i had a veggie.

JD J.,"Torrance, CA",0,14,,4.0,8/23/2013,"I've ordered  food that was so, so but for the most part, I enjoy BJ's.  The service is a little bit irritating like a lot of places.  Orders get mixed up, or undercooked, as if young people can't hear anymore above their texting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-menifee?start=520
Leigh Ann R.,"Menifee, CA",9,11,2,2.0,6/1/2014,"In a word - disappointing. We don't come here very often because of the expense and the general busyness of this place, but we do have high expectations based on previous visits to this location. It wasn't just one thing, the service was ok, not great, the food ok, not great. My husband ordered fried chicken expecting actual parts of chicken and he got basically chicken tenders with gravy on them. I had the shrimp pasta and the shrimp was undercooked. The waiter was very attentive about getting the dish remade and he apologized. Here's one of my pet peeves with restaurants in general:  food runners. The food runners were the ones who delivered our meals. Why in the name of BJ's do they pass you a plate, announcing ""it's hot."" If it's hot, then bring me hot pads or something! We were a party of seven, sitting in one of their long booths, so I had to pass my son's pizza to him, with the ""hot plate"" announcement. Luckily, it wasn't too hot for my hands. Two of the meals were left behind by the food runners, mine and one of my kids. They came back pretty quickly, but didn't bother to tell me ""hot plate"" this time when my bowl was handed to me across the table. This time it was a little too hot for my hands, I managed to set it in front of me without dumping it on myself or the table, which was my initial reaction. The food runner apologized about 10 times (not exaggerating, I promise). And joked about how he's gotten used to the hot plates. This was my first dish. When my reordered pasta came, with a different runner, she tried to pass it to me again like the first one did. I said no way, been there, done that. Although she was not aware of the previous lack of warning, she was not amused and looked a little annoyed that she had to walk to the other side of the booth to place my dish in front of me. Like I said, it wasn't a horrible experience, just ok and I expect a heck of a lot more from BJ's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-menifee?start=520
JR R.,"Murrieta, CA",0,100,,4.0,9/13/2012,"Went with a large party, very busy for a week night as recently opened. With reservation we still waited 1/2 hour. The front desk was rather unorganized, though pleasant. Our server Susan, was exceptional, obviously very experienced. The beers are good, especially the IPA's. Nice menu reasonably priced. Will probably wait a while to go back after the novelty has worn off. This area really needed a nice restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-menifee?start=520

Mz T.,"Melbourne Beach, FL",0,41,3,1.0,8/18/2013,"worse service at BJs ever! We are local, and generally enjoy BJs so was beyond excited to see this one open. Gave it about 6-7 visits. it is officially the worse overall. had a couple stellar servers at 1st, which is why we've been several more times. But lately, it is clear the management does not value/train/focus on the meaning of customer service. At last visit, server came to put drink napkins and say she will be right back. bar area we were in seemed semi/busy so we appreciated the acknowledgement. 10min later and she still had not come back to take our drink order!? almost walked out when she finally came. that was the start of one of the worse evenings at BJs (Other was also at this location; beer tasting dinner from hell). 1hr later due to the slowest server on earth, we were handed someone else's pizza. an apology from our server then an apology from 2 different managers. appreciated the apologies so we didn't become those customers that waged war cuz their pizza took over 45min to arrive, but when our bill came and there was no adjustment for the pizza debauchery...well that sealed the deal for us. paid the bill as is cuz didn't want to spend any more than the 2hrs already wasted there but will never come back to THIS BJs ever again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-menifee?start=520
Breanne R.,"Rancho Bernardo, San Diego, CA",0,6,,1.0,1/7/2014,I went there for my friends birthday.  I called ahead for the 30 minute call ahead reservation.  I got there and they have me the buzzer to inform me when my table was ready.  The hostess informed me it was about a 30 minute wait.  I waited close to an hour and finally went and asked how much longer.  They informed me that they had activated my buzzer but I had not come.  I told them that I had waited in the waiting area if the restaurant and it never went off.  She apologized and told me I would be the next table.  I sat down and watch 3 tables get called.  I went back up there and asked the other hostess how much longer.  The hostess looked up the information and told me since I had been given that new buzzer 5 minutes before to be patient. (With attitude and clear annoyance). The origional hostess jumped in and told her I had been waiting longer than 5 minutes. The hostesses were both bitchy and had I not been there for a friends birthday I would have left.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-menifee?start=520
Mary S.,"Sun City, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/20/2013,"My husband and I went to bjs for dinner on a Friday night. The hostess told as it would be   30-35 min wait. We said ok and went to the bar. The service at the bar was efficient , we're called for our table within fifteen min. We placed our order for steak and chicken and waited and waited. Our waitress was busy but went to the back and checked for our order several times. She was apologetic for the wait  and said she would tell her manager about the delay. Goodness that also took like twenty mins. By then it was pretty late, past nine o'clock, we were tired of waiting and just not in a mood to eat there anymore. Finally when the manager brought our dinner he said it was on the house because of the wait and he hoped we would give this place another try. We took our late dinner home. This is not our first time eating at bjs in menifee, we live few min away from it, and is not the first time we had waited long for our food but this was the worse wait. I've tried giving this place several tries but won't be going there again. Would drive an extra fifteen min to temecula where the service is better. On a good note the pizza and beer are very good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-menifee?start=520
