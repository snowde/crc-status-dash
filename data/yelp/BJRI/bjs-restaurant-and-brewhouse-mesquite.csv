Jackie S.,"Garland, TX",0,3,,2.0,3/26/2017,"I love the food,  absolutely hate the service.  .  Every time we come here, it takes no less than 2 hours to eat.  . Do NOT come here for your luch break!!! .  Today,  our server moved  soooooooo slooooooooow.  . We had to asked twice for a refill,  and it STILL took over 15 minutes.  I watched another server practically run laps around our section, meanwhile,  we hardly saw our server & she messed up hubby's order (bacon on a veggie patty burger, really?).   . I got the endless soup & salad,  but she didnt ask me if i wanted another round,  i had to ask,  and i STILL got my second salad before the hubby got his food ( wrong)  the first time. And when he did get it right,  we're pretty sure they just microwaved the fries that came on the first plate,  not made a new batch like they should have.  . Felt like our server really couldn't care less about our dining experience, or the reputation of the establishment she works for.   . Just really really really really really bad service.  Took way too long, didnt get refills,  didnt get our order right, didnt seem to care,  didnt get a good tip.  . Too bad,  the food is usually really good,  but this was the the final visit for us.   . Highly recommend a staff purge and better training for new employees.  . The reviews are pretty constant;  your staff sucks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesquite?start=20
Eric F.,"Mesquite, TX",16,74,10,5.0,9/26/2015,"Had BJ's for lunch and I must say this is the 3rd time at this restaurant and it has progressed each time.  One bad thing for me but not so bad for most was the AC has some issues. It wasn't a big deal for most of the ladies, I was told my one of the staff members the ladies seem to be relaxed and not freezing. The lady moved me to a spot where the air was working fine and assured me the air would be fixed ASAP. I was good because it was too hot.  Foods the pizza and the seafood jambalaya was to die for. The small salad was amazing. The staff was great as well, the lady that waited our table was very nice and took care of all her customers.   Should be rated higher than 3, maybe the price is an issue.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesquite?start=20
Heather S.,"Plano, TX",30,113,48,1.0,3/27/2016,"If I could give negative stars for service and attitude for this entire BJ's establishment I would. From the host/ess stand, food runners, and servers. Wow. Since the opening of BJ's the service has diminished so badly  I will never spend my money here again, regardless of the food. Don't even waste your time.  We arrived about 1:00pm on a Saturday afternoon. We came in through the outside entrance not the interior mall entrance. The music was so loud that you couldn't hear a word the hostess said. I 'assumed' she asked us how many we had for our table. We watched her look at something and gather menus. Then we saw her say something to us and we blindly followed her to a table. We sat down. After about 5 minutes, a waiter arrives and gets our drink order. He seemed nice enough but that took a little bit. We ordered alcohol so luckily he brought our waters first because the bar drinks took awhile too. We order guacamole and chips as an appetizer size it was well after lunch and we hadn't eaten all day.  A food runner happened to bring out our appetizer. I asked her ""doesn't this come with salsa""? She rudely said ""I don't think so but I don't read the menu.""  I read her the menu since we had not yet ordered our food yet.  She walked away from me and said ""I don't know the menu. I'll tell your waiter."" A few minutes later out comes a salsa.  My fiancée ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich which was good. I ordered a combo with a garden salad and stuffed baked potato with garden vegetable with no cheese. When mine arrived the potato has a white sauce on it. When I asked the waiter he said it was Alfredo. I said I asked for no cheese. He said I know but that's Alfredo. I said I know Alfredo is half cheese and cream and I cannot eat dairy. He took it away. Another was brought and it looked like they had picked off the cheese on another. I didn't care I was over it at this point. SO DONE! The guacamole was tasteless and bland. The fire-roasted salsa was good at least. Not spicy but decent. If you want bad service, loud music, people who don't listen to anything you want, and just okay food.  Go here! It's just like place in Waiting.....Shenanigainz! Not only do they make you feel like the customers in the movie, you are the customer, and they are the servers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesquite?start=20
alfred g.,"Garland, TX",14,22,26,3.0,5/30/2015,"Okay, dropped by for a quick bite and was craving carbs and protein so went with the Top Choice Sirloin (8oz lean meat), baked potato and asparagus. Sirloin wasn't that bad at all, very lean actually.  However, the baked potato was pretty dry and the asparagus had a little too much salt for my taste. Buuutttt, the bartender was very acknowledgeable about the mass selection of beer there... lager, ale, IPA, stout, etc.  I'm not too much of a beer drinker but his selection was great!  It actually made the dinner better... thanks Patrick. Finally, I couldn't leave without some dessert.  Went with the Pizookie and selected Macadamia Nut and GLUTEN-FREE Chocolate Chip. But it wasn't for me, it was for my... uhh... nephew!  Yeah, that's right... my nephew. I might come back again just to try out another flavor and get on the bandwagon with all these damn beers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesquite?start=20

David C.,"Mesquite, TX",25,34,13,3.0,4/23/2017,"We went in for HAPPY HOUR and to eat on Friday Date night. Had downloaded a $10 off coupon off their website ( recommend you do the same ). Great beers and Cakes loved the Margaritas. Waiter was attentive and friendly. We ordered the Personal Size Pizza for the Happy Hour half price special. Atmosphere was great, spacious dining and bar, looked like we had found our new Happy Hour hang out. Wrong, SO why do I only give it three stars. Well when we finally got our food, I had the Parmesan Chicken, they were tough and the vegetables were cool or like they had been sitting around waiting on the rest to come out. A minute later they bring us our appetizer Pizza after the main courses. That was not cool. So Cakes ordered the Chicken Alfredo and she loved it. Tried it and it was hot and delicious. We get our bill and think Hmm that seems high but pay it and leave. Tipped the waiter a little extra even though the appetizer foul up, not his fault. Get home and check out the bill, they charged us full price on the appetizer and did not take off the $10 coupon, Come on - what kind of deal breaker is that? I guess it was on us for not checking and trusting that it would be all right but sure left a sour taste so to speak.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesquite?start=20
Laura T.,"Sachse, TX",2,68,67,4.0,6/19/2016,"I have 3 ratings for this place.  We went at 11:40am on Fathers Day. Crowd was just steady, but with plenty of empty tables.  1. Hostesses. 1 star. Uninterested. Standing in a group at the door and ignoring people for the most part.  2. Waiter. 2 stars. Cute teen boy doing his best. Not a great waiter, but sweet. He gets a pass as not just anyone can be a good waiter. We were happy that they were not busy. It would have been very annoying if it were any slower. It was on the edge of just too slow. Luckily we were visiting with family and we were not in a rush.  3. Food. 4 stars. Really good. The burger was fantastic and the fries were the best we have had in ages. My dad got a pizza and loved it. My daughter and I got salads and they were good and prepared correctly to our order. Mom got a club type sandwich and loved it.  We will go back to BJ's for sure... Not sure about this location. Town east is really much nicer than it has been in a while.

Personally, I will never be returning to this particular location due to the Poor customer service. Our waiter was okay but the manager and other staff members were not so good. I told one of the food runners that my ""clean"" plate had something on it and she acted insulted that I asked for a new plate! She brought a fresh plate out and shoved it in my face asking if it was okay! Very rude. Also, I must add that the calamari came out visibly burnt....like burnt to a crisp. I asked for the manager so that he could straighten it out, but he never came (even though he was doing nothing standing looking over the dining area).

Kristie A.,"Dallas, TX",949,761,2846,3.0,7/22/2010,"This place was recommended to me by one of my friends.  I tend to stay away from chains, but he went on and on about how good the pizza was and how close to Chicago style it was.  They also make some of their own beers.  When I found out there was a new location at Town East Mall, I knew my friend that lives in Mesquite would join me for pizza and beer. We rolled up last night and the place is spotless.  You can tell it's brand new.  I love the decor with the dark colored chairs/tables and the wood floors.  The ceilings are high and open with exposed air ducts all painted black.  A very chill and contemporary place.  There were flat screen TV's around, but they were all high enough that if you didn't pay attention to them you'd probably forget they were there.  Bonus for some kickass tunes playing overhead.  Buzzcocks = yes, Dramarama = yes! I started with their microbrew the Harvest Hefeweizen.  It tasted almost identical to a Pyramid, which I didn't mind.  Afterwards I ended up switching to Chimay White cuz it sounded good, and it had been awhile since I've had one.  I was impressed with their import beer list too.  If beer is not your thing they have wine, signature cocktails and a full bar.  They also have homemade root beer. Browsing through the food menu took a while even though I knew I wanted pizza.  There's so much food to choose from.  Sandwiches, pasta dishes, salads, burgers, flatbread pizzas etc.  I finally made it to the deep dish part of the menu and settled on a mini pepperoni with the tomato chunks on top.  About 15 minutes later our pizzas come out.  Now...it wasn't horrible by any means, and if I had to eat it again, I would.  It was pretty bland.  It definitely could use some more spices or sumthin.  My dinning partner concurred with his small sausage and jalapeno deep dish. We were totally stuffed, but decided to order the brownie dessert.  It comes with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream and piled high with whip cream.  It was yummy!  (see photo). Our waiter was the cutest thing ever and didn't mind bringing us beer after beer while we took our time eating and chatting. After running around the mall some we ended up back at BJ's in the bar area for one last beer and the bartender was really friendly.  You know the kind that shakes your hand and asks your name.  Nice guys working here! Bottom-line, would I come here again?  I probably would.  I wouldn't seek it out, but my friend in Mesquite drives to Dallas all the time to dine with me, so I'd be willing to suck it up and head his way again.  I'd try some other things on the menu.  If nothing else it'd be a great place to sit at the bar and grab some beers.  Then go drunk shopping, which is the only shopping I can really stand.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesquite?start=40

Jessica M.,"Oklahoma City, OK",302,206,548,5.0,11/17/2013,"BJ's will always be a top pick for low key date nights. It is a chain and not as wonderful as some places in Dallas but when hubby and I would like to stay local and gets some drinks this is always a good spot. I feel bad for the owners sometimes because the restaurant is so slow and a server confided that it is the least busy of all the franchises around here but to me its a major PLUS. I love knowing that there won't be line for a table or a busy bar with no seats. I usually don't go crazy with my food. I stick with ordering the same thing at every restaurant but with BJ's I am never afraid to try something new. I have liked the pizza, appetizers, sandwiches, specialty plates and most of all: The House cider.  I recommend this place for parties too!

Yum!! 9/16 Ate dinner at 10:30pm 1 star for no hostess and really slow service entire night 4 stars - server was attentive  1 star- steak was so salty and had to send it back because it was covered in seasoning and overcooked just ate vegetables because it took way too long to get that steak 4 stars - clam chowder.

Oscar C.,"Dallas, TX",41,3,2,2.0,9/15/2017,"Overall a very mediocre dining experience. Our server was friendly and started well with her intro and drink order. Unfortunately, things only went downhill from there. 1) My Oktoberfest beer never made it to the table. 2) We received our appetizers from server assistants and were not given app plates nor did we receive a timely check back (which came after we finished our apps).  3) One in our party received her entree with the appetizers (a soup and salad). The soup was cold by the time the rest of our entrees arrived about 8 or so minutes later. Also, the server assistant needed my help because she was holding five plates with no tray. 4) Remaining entrees were brought out by assistant servers who attempted to hand a very hot plate to a child at our table. The server ended up reaching across the table to only place the hot plate in the middle of the table and simply nudged it in the direction of my niece. No check on quality of entrees and no offer of condiments. After another 5 to 10 minutes I got up and grabbed condiments from an unbussed table. Our server did not check back for about 10 minutes. All this on a relatively slow Friday night. Our section only had a handful of 3 to 4 tops, making the whole experience more annoying. 5) A manager walked by twice looking stressed without checking in on tables or greeting guests. 6) Kitchen did a good job. 8/10 with a few details missing but solid food overall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesquite

We had made reservations prior to our arrival because of the surprise party that we were having. I couldn't decide what to get so I stuck to the basics, chicken tenders with fries. It was good but nothing too special. I couldn't leave BJ's without getting a pizookie so me and my friend decided to spilt the pizookie trio. We got white chocolate macadamia nut, cookies n cream, and chocolate chunk. The favorite among us two was definitely the cookies n cream. I personally was not a big fan of the chocolate chunk. It wasn't that great and my friend agreed.  Service was okaaay. We were a group of 10-15 so I understand the stress, however they were kind of rude.

I usually don't like eating in Mesquite, the food is almost never tasty but we didn't feel like driving to Africa for a good pie. We ordered the medium bjs special with this appetizer that literally came with EVERYTHING.  half of the appetizer was cold. And the other half was so piping hot that I burned my tongue. I'm assuming the boneless wings were patiently waiting for the spinach artichoke dip to get ready.  The pizza was exceptional. Countless toppings. My husband longed for more marinara but it was just right for me. Used a $25 gift card, we still walked out of there fat, full, and $40 short. FOOD IS WAAAAAYYYYYYY overpriced!

I've had BJ wings before, and knew they wouldn't disappoint.  Upon entering, our hostess was rude. They weren't busy, but she carried on her conversation with her co-worker until she finally grabbed menus. Still no acknowledgment, but I guess the grabbing of the menus was our cue that she was now attending to us. I kindly asked her if we could have a booth and she said yes and so we seated ourselves in the booth closest to the entrance (not a problem, it was close). After sitting there a bit we noticed it was under the vent and was a bit chilly. Double whammy of chill being near the door. I kindly asked if we could move to a different booth. She said yes again and we again seated  ourselves, this time taking our plates and utensils with us to the booth across the restaurant. No help. This girl, just did not show up to work today! I gave 3-stars because after we bypassed the hostess, everything was smooth sailing from there. Sad, but true. We had an awesome server (I think his name was Louie?), and the hot wings and Santa Fe chicken salad we ordered was sooo good!  There's a lot more wings on my way to BJ's, but I'd eat here again.

I got the Peruvian quinoa plate (something like that) with chicken. It was pretty tasty but towards the end, as I made my way to bottom of the plate, it was a bit too lemony; however my chicken was cooked to perfection! My bf got some salmon dish and he liked the glaze on the salmon but the couscous had a weird texture. That's not the restaurant's fault though we've both never had couscous before- it's probably supposed to be gooey.

That's what happens when you have a menu that's too big. That's another thing I don't understand. Their menu is extremely sporadic and has no real concept or direction.

Nonya M.,"Mesquite, TX",46,34,,4.0,3/16/2012,"Based on my experience last night I would give it a full 5 stars, however, trying to not be biased I will give it four total.  We sat in the bar area close to closing time.  Surprisingly, the waitress was really nice and attentive although we came in an hour until close.  This is rare since normally waiters have issues when you are one of the last ones.  The main eating area was closed or we would have sat there instead.  It all worked out well though as the bar was roomy and felt more private. I ordered my favorite water and lime mixture and my hubbs had the D.P.  I tried it out and instead of the normal flat soda pop we get most other places, it was refreshingly bubbly and the right amount of syrup.  This is always a nice sign of the quality.  We thought of ordering the fried artichoke appetizer but passed.  I have had these before and they are wonderful.   It took awhile for us to decide but after ordering some bad ones in the past we had narrowed it down.  By the way, I am not a fan of the bacon/mac or the tomato soup and I will say the tacos I got in the past were small. We did order two entrees the Skirt Steak Salad and the Parmesan Crusted Chicken.  My husband skipped the balsamic dressing and subbed in cesar.  I had the white cheddar mashed potatoes and green beans.  Excellent choices as we were both overly pleased with the taste.  We tried a bite of each others meal and agreed it was the best we have had at the place.  If you like the Costeletta from Cheescake Factory then you will like the Parm. Chicken here.  The steak was very tender and full of flavor served medium by default I believe. Back to the service, we were exceptionally pleased with the attitude and attentiveness so much that we told the manager.  Overall we had a great experience that night.  In the past it has not always been excellent but this time it deserved a 5 star rating.  Taking everything into consideration I left it with 4 stars for the many times I have been to reflect on the total experiences.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesquite?start=60

They have great burgers and salads and a nice appetizer and small plate selection. The California burger is awesome; it is served on sourdough with avocado. BJ's is one of the few chain restaurants that doesn't overcook their burgers. A medium is actually pink! Favorite appetizers include avocado eggrolls, flatbread pizzas and fried artichokes. Their dinner salads are huge and they go really well with a couple small plates if you want to make a family style meal.  This location is attached to the Town East mall. Parking can be an issue when the mall gets busy. The restaurant itself is large, it's usually busy but typically does not have a long wait. It has a upscale sports bar feel, there are TVs throughout playing various games.  The microbrews are very good and are a good price. I usually order the BJ's beer but they have a respectable selection of other beers. The brown reminds me of a Newcastle.  The stout is a little too bitter for my taste but the porter is very nice.

Erica D.,"North Richland Hills, TX",0,40,6,1.0,6/17/2015,"Went to this restaurant for the first time ever with a very large group of 80. Keep that in mind because I am very aware the service is different from small parties. So how many waiters do you think they would have on a Monday about 1:00 for a party of 80? 2! Yes 2 lonely waiters for our event. This was a reserved party so I am not sure why only 2 people. The rest of the place was only half full and nobody waiting to be seated. It took over 30 minutes just to get my starter salad of mozzarella and tomatoes. The entire meal took 1 1/2 hours and we were lucky because we flagged down the waiter to just get service. First off, my salad was half the size as two other people who got the same dish. Really? You didn't charge me half the price so I did not understand that. I ordered a mini pizza. It took 45 minutes to get that. It was ice cold by the time I got it. Not a single refill on my soda. I would like to think the food is good, but I cant say for sure because mine was cold and the salad was 4 bite fulls. Now I find it funny it only took 5 minutes for the waiter to bring me my bill and charge my card. That was the fastest part of the whole trip. I dont live around that area but I will be trying the BJ's by my house. I dont recommend for a larger party. But I am willing to give another location a chance to see if the food is good.

M W.,"Heath, TX",17,21,1,5.0,12/2/2013,Nice place !  Very clean and modern.  Large menu that has something for everyone.  Food is excellent and waiters are very helpful.  I really liked the flatbread pizza.  It was very crispy and flavorful.  The thin cut crispy fries are awesome !  This is a good family place and large enough to accommodate a large group.  Good place to stop and eat when you are out Christmas Shopping !,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesquite?start=80
Kacie C.,"Dallas, TX",179,51,1,4.0,10/12/2011,"First thing to know...sit at the bar!! We've sat in the seated sections before and the service has been....um...let's just say, we've had better. We have sat at the bar several times and have always had great service! Bartenders are always at top speed and super friendly.  The micro brew beers, Pirahana is my fav. I miss the micro brews that have been in Dallas, like Two Rows, may you rest in peace. BJ's is the closest to us and we've never been let down.  There's 3 things that i rotate in my orders when i go there. The Ahi tuna salad. YUM! If you are looking for a crisp, clean, light  salad, I highly recommend this one. The second, is California Cobb sandwich. A great sammich on a hoagie roll and thick wedge yummytastic fries. LOVE IT! Now onto the 3rd and heaviest. The chicken parmigiana. Best I've had yet (aside from personally cooked ones) Perfectly cooked thin breaded chicken....two slices actually. This plate is HUGE! Topped with mozzarella! and a side of spaghetti and marinara, which, i must say has a bit of a kick. It's great and it's great reheated the next day with your leftovers.  SCORE! to the BJ's, which is the last standing good brew house near us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesquite?start=80
Tracy M.,"Forney, TX",137,36,1,4.0,4/24/2011,"Just got here.  So far great, fast service. Because of the location I'm just not seeing this place making here at the mesquite mall! Just my opinion. They serve lunch menu all day, everyday.  Clean table, good lighting, we are here on easter, there is virtually no one here.  We were both itching for a burger and a new place, close by so here it goes !  I ordered the melt, cheese burger on sourdough basically, hold the grilled onions, yuk!  Hubby ordered a California burger and right now I'm just writing this review.  Water taste really pure and drinkable , no draft beer for me but the selections look pretty wide.     Food arrived! The burgers are gigantic! We both had sour dough toast.  My toast was a little soggy but the manager came over, I told her and she offered to replace it. I didn't think it was a deal breaker. The wedge fries my hubby got here good.  I don't like the thousand island dressing on the burger. I would have gotten it on the side it I'd realized it. The char on the burger added a very salty flavor on some bites.  The burger was good and my hubby said he loved his. Great service. We got in and out in an hour for $25.   We will return, we liked it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesquite?start=80
Jake C.,"Mesquite, TX",0,14,,3.0,1/8/2014,Me and my girlfriend went to have a quick dinner here and we had the 5 meat thin crust pizza which was decent. Now the sweet tea they brew there was really good! Our server was really cool and friendly. The reason I rate it with a 3 is because of the quality of the food. It was okay pizza. Something that can be made anywhere. But still okay. Otherwise everything else was great. 5 star service though.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesquite?start=80
Tracy D.,"Forney, TX",46,15,,4.0,3/17/2012,"My husband and I went there last night for dinner and we enjoyed it. I wasn't crazy about the appetizer (we got the sampler and found out it was for four people, not two, so we brought a lot home), but the Iced Tea was really good! My husband ordered the Jambalaya. He said it was different - he's from New Orleans - but liked it enough to order it again. It was VERY spicy though. I did notice some sweating, not that he'd admit it! I got the Parmesan Chicken. It was awesome! The chicken was so tender I didn't need a knife, and it melted in my mouth. I got two huge pieces. The sauce was a bit too lemon-y, but there wasn't a whole lot of it, so it wasn't overpowering. The mashed potatos were very good, but I didn't get much broccoli. It looked more like garnish than a serving size. Service, on the other hand, was just ""meh."" When we walked in, we were greeted by some overly cheerful, Pollyanna types that reminded me of Disneyland. I kept expecting them to say, Have a Magical Day! But they didn't. It was a nice change though, many other places have greeters that don't even smile.  Our server was nice, but not around much. We didn't get refills on our drinks until we were about ready to leave. It took awhile just to place our order, and after ordering our drinks we thought he forgot about us. He kept saying sorry, that he had so many other tables. I wanted to say, So? Not my problem. But instead I said it with a 15% tip (we usually give 20% or more).  So yeah, we'll go back, but it won't be on top ten list. Especially around Christmas... the parking situation at the mall is just awful!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesquite?start=80

Alan G.,"Sunnyvale, TX",0,8,,5.0,4/23/2013,"I discovered BJ's a few weeks after I moved into my house, 6 years ago, while shopping at Town East Mall. Now, I eat here at least once a month. I've rarely had the same entree twice and I've never been disappointed. Plus, the prices are very reasonable. The only thing I never go without is the Orange Cream Soda. LOVE IT. Normally, chain restaurants at the mall aren't this good. If you want a hotdog, to the food court, if you want a great sit down dinner, go to BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesquite?start=80
Lori O.,"Garland, TX",67,11,,3.0,6/21/2014,"Went in on a Wednesday night. I frequent this location and normally order the Ahi Poke. In the past the Ahi Poke was plentiful enough for all the wonton chips that come with it, but this time it had a spare amount of Ahi and the poke sauce was non-existent. I also ordered the Watermelon and Feta salad as it is only available seasonally. It used to be better tasting. Our waitress was good about re-filling our drinks but her food runner brought out my husband's salad maybe a couple of minutes before the main course was brought out and brought my salad out at the same time as well which was to be part of my main course which I promptly informed him and sent it back until the time was right which was only a couple of minutes later. My son had the gourmet mac and cheese which was good and my husband had the Bison burger. His only complaint was that the burger had at least an inch or two worth of lettuce on it which made it difficult for him to put his mouth around the burger to bite it. The crispy calamari was good as always but had an unfortunate grease after-taste on several pieces. Not sure if these issues were because we went there on a different day than we usually do. It was ok, but for the money spent I guess I expected more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesquite?start=80

Amy O.,"Waxahachie, TX",2,43,8,3.0,12/17/2011,"Nice atmosphere. Our waitress was friendly but goofy acting, but was good service. I had the lunch portion chicken parmesana and it was really good. Spicy marinara was different, good and really had spice. I enjoyed it! My husband had tai salmon and said it was good too! DRINKS- I did order their root beer because I'm pregnant and was told it was caffeine free and did not like it! I ended up drinking water. Husband ordered one of their piranha pale ale beer. Said it was good and strong. It was different and good. Dessert- we split the cookie pizookie and it was OK. Our cookie was very hard but all thee goop piled on it made it fine. Probably won't order again but will definitely stop and eat here again if we are ever in the area!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesquite?start=80

No one to greet you at the door- we waited for quite a while until we seated ourselves . After trying to get the attention of a server, someone finally noticed us and she took out drink order. We just got soft drinks , and those didn't show up for at least another 10 minutes. I could tell mine had been sitting for a while because you could taste the water from the ice melting. Anyways we ordered and the food came out another 20-25 minutes later- which would of been fine if the restaurant hadn't been almost completely empty and had we ordered something other than dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesquite?start=80
Denzil M.,"Mission Viejo, CA",5,3,,1.0,8/8/2014,"I'm from California and this is my second time coming here: first in 2012 and second time 2014.  First time I came here was with my family, and we were literally the only ones here. You can imagine my disappointment when it took 40 minutes for our party platter pizookie to come out (it normally took 15 minutes at other locations). Again I'm here 2 years later, and there service remains terrible. The waiter gave me a flat root beer (it was obvious from looking at the beverage that it was that). Problem 2: it took 30 minutes to put together a simple feta watermelon salad where it shouldn't take longer than 15 minutes in reality. My last issue was that the waiter brought only 4 spoons for 7 of us to use (I knew the economy is going through a rough time, but really??). Conclusion: I wouldn't be as upset if I saw them taking initiative to improve, but they remain unchanging in their quality of  service, and continue to keep customers upset.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesquite?start=100
Barbara A.,"Mesquite, TX",0,1,,1.0,5/9/2011,"The service was incredibly slow, though place wasn't over crowded.  Some food was good, some waaaay bad!  Salad lettuce more white than green, low cal talapia dinner covered with paprika (as substitute for flavor?), and all of us kept ordering more dressing for salads, dry pizza, etc.  But the worst of all--on Mother's Day!--they ran out of ice cream which made ALL of their desserts impossible to order, even without ice cream.  Computer wouldn't take the orders.  Manager should have been able to override and get us some kind of dessert, or at least come to table with a voucher for a dessert at a later date.  It's good costumer service and is common at most restaurants.  One person at our table was overcharged and it took forever for the (absent) manager to okay redoing the bill.  Do not go here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesquite?start=100
