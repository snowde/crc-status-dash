Ben S.,"Dayton, OH",43,53,39,2.0,12/13/2017,"Ok first off let me say I have had multiple great visits in BJ brewhouse. But this last visit was....um...horrendous! First the good. BJ's features a huge bar, tons of taps, lots of seating, clean bathrooms and generally great service. The menu is very large with something for everyone. And the quality is pretty good. I was excited to eat here because of my previous visits but man did they drop the ball. I can pretty much sum up my 2 star rating with 2 sentences.  6 people, 3 hour wait when told 45. Food came out and was cold.  I'm not kidding, 3 hour wait from the time we walked into the restaurant to when we got our food. I ordered the quinoa rice with shrimp (thought I'd try something new) and it came out cold to the touch. The manager blamed it on Christmas party's but good god Man that is bad.  I will probably be back to BJ's (1 because I love there piranha pale ale, (made in house) and 2, because our friends just love the food)  Fingers crossed for a better experience next time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-miamisburg-2
Christopher K.,"Springboro, OH",16,32,,4.0,12/29/2017,"Every time I visit BJ's I leave with a smile.  This location is close to home, and with a family of four, the menu provides a wide enough variety for everyone to find something they'll like.  During our most recent visit, I decided to give the Double Bone-In Pork Chop a try and was very happy with my choice.  The pork was tender and juicy and seasoned to perfection.  We always enjoy the craft sodas and the Monkey Bread Pizookie is a great choice for dessert if you still have room.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-miamisburg-2
Amanda H.,"Cincinnati, OH",98,166,477,4.0,11/1/2017,"We went during happy hour before the Alton Brown concert and was so so pleasantly surprised with their menu. First of all it's Very large. Shirley something for everybody. We did the happy hour and got half off a bunch of different things. I love the wings they were amazing, the avocado rolls were great, the pizza was just OK. It was about 2/3 crust and only a tiny little bit of toppings. (actually the only thing we did not like.) And the wine was half off which was awesome. We will definitely go there again if you're in the area. I'd recommend it just your clear for pizza unless maybe the bigger ones are full of more toppings",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-miamisburg-2
Jason K.,"Dayton, OH",39,31,370,2.0,4/1/2017,"Wow. I'm not sure where to start. I've had some amazing food at this establishment, and some mediocre food. What really brings this place down is their far from stellar service, time and time again. This is by no means and expensive Michelin star restaurant, but not having your appetizer brought out for 30 min, and never being able to get one refill is ridiculous. We were asked once if we needed a refill, only to have the server walk by 15 minutes later and realizing she forgot, then taking another 15 minutes to come back with them. We were so feed up, we didn't even eat a 1/4 of our dinner and we're scared to even wait for a take home box, let alone the check. Hopefully they get their act together, because this place could be stellar for what it is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-miamisburg-2

Brian K.,"Cedarburg, WI",15,3,4,1.0,2/12/2017,Went here for lunch today. We really enjoyed the one in Peoria As but this one today made use really open our eyes that even a chain can disappoint. My wife ordered a beef dip sandwich and when it arrived it was cold as well as the wedges. Considering it was busy we overlooked that. Till she took a bite and had me try it cause it seemed a little off. The beef tasted like the beef when you put it in the microwave. Has that certain taste that is hard to overcome. Second is the broth to dip the sandwich in. It was a bowl of oil basically. It or left a heavy coating in your mouth and sick to your stomach. My wife has being curled up in bed now for 3 hours. She could only eat 3 bites of her sandwich. Cold fries are nasty to begin with. I ordered the guacamole deluxe burger. Felt like I was at a MacDonald restaurant. The patty barely filled half of the bun.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-miamisburg-2

We were never offered a refill and had to flag our server down for each one. Our appetizers took over 30 minutes to appear and were overcooked. Our meals were less than thrilling; undercooked broccoli and brussel sprouts, small pasta portions for the price, overcooked salmon, etc. I had a burger, fries, brussel sprouts and a soda and spent $22 before tip.

As far as atmosphere is concerned, I like this BJ's. They have that sports bar feel, but it still looks classy. I wanted to sit outside, but my friend said it was too hot, so I compromised and we sat inside. Our waitress Elizabeth was very friendly.  When we walked in k saw that they had some new appetizers, so I decided to try that. They were quite tasty. I would definitely get them again.  For my main meal I ordered the lemon pepper wings. I love the lemon pepper wings at my favorite spot, but these didn't come close. They were really salty, so I sent them back and ordered the grilled chicken Alfredo, which was really good.

Rob M.,"Miamisburg, OH",0,19,,2.0,4/4/2017,"Trying to be careful here since I usually don't mind going to this place.  I would just give them One Star since zero isn't legal but I do have a history of coming here and I hope this was just an aberration.  Typically, we have decent service, a decent atmosphere, and decent food.  Not great nor particularly fast, just decent.  Not so much this Sunday, 2 April 2017.  Honestly, I've notice a gradual decline toward mediocrity which is sad given that I rather like the Nutty Brunette (the beer, not the waitress) and how crowded and popular this place was just a year ago...so ""Meh, I 've experienced better"" is as low as I'll go today...but know the urge to totally dump on this place is there.... Our issues this Sunday were pretty basic.  I had a party of 6&1/2, so we called ahead after Church (Around 1230 or so) and was told that we were looking at a 30 delay.  Outstanding, put us on the list and we'll be there in 15!  Sounds perfect, right?  It took a full hour and 10 minutes to get us a seat!  We saw similar parties in size come in and be seated...no biggie ""if"" they had called ahead but here's the thing, they didn't.  When we were finally seated, it was because I went up, showed the gal on my phone where they acknowledged my call-in to which I got a bright, ""Oh, You're Next""...No apology or other acknowledgement of an error.  I did hear one of the gals mutter to the other...""oh, I f'd up"" as I passed the hostess area.  Lack of professionalism aside, somebody should have apologized to us for the error. Still, water under the bridge, we were seated back in the last section and...ignored.  Two other large parties were sat near us and...ignored.  Another full 20 minutes and one...one...only one...server showed up to work the ENTIRE FREAKIN' SECTION!  Thought she was going to cry when she saw the number of folks in her area.  Still, she gave it a heck of a go!   Sadly, nobody was supporting her...food was slow to come out and therefore no longer warm...drinks were slow...everything was S.L.O.W.  Good thing my family all liked each other at that particular point in time and the Grandkids were angelic...even the baby...which is suspicious, but on a different level.  Other tables were not as forgiving.  Kind of embittered the entire section if you know what I mean.  Poor kid. We finally got our bill and paid our bail bond to get free of this situation.  Walked out the door at 3:45...with nary a manager to be seen.  He/she didn't come out to support the Waitress, not even once.  I did not push it since family was mostly happy, a little stir crazy but mostly happy.  But dang, what a complete and utter failure on the customer service side.  Sadly, this BJ's location is off my food radar for the immediate future.  Maybe once the colleges let out and they get some additional help but for now...nope. Oh, and I tipped that poor waitress in cash.  Hope she pocketed the whole thing and didn't share with the back staff...they really let her down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-miamisburg-2?start=20

Kimberly J.,"Lebanon, OH",421,440,2375,4.0,2/11/2015,"This a great spot. Like a higher end sports bar. The food here is really great and they have a lot of portion size options which I think is awesome. The have small bites, appetizers and meal sizes. We split the California burger which was amazing. I loved the bread alternative. Plus splitting the sandwich left us more room for two of the light bites: the bruchetta and corn fritters. Both were really great.  By the way their beer selection is expansive and they even have beer they brew themselves. They allow tasting so sample a few and take your time. There are a lot of really great choices here.

I do find a lot of the food a bit too salty, so I always ask that they leave the salt off or promise to use it with moderation. I've enjoyed the salads, flatbreads, particularly the gluten free and flying pig (I think), as well as the steaks. You're not in a steakhouse, so set your expectations for better than a burger, and enjoy. The house beers are all terrific, and there are about 50 more guest beers to choose from. If you're in town, and like good beer, no reason not to come. They also have the largest damn television I've ever seen.

Jess H.,"Dayton, OH",82,240,283,5.0,6/19/2015,"I first tried this chain restaurant in California. I remember calling my boyfriend back home and telling him ""man, I wish they had a BJ's near us!""  ...lo and behold, there was! I had never heard of the chain before so I was pleasantly surprised to dine at this location after my California excursion.  The setting is like an upscale sports bar mixed with an Applebee's. The prices of the food and drinks are OUTSTANDING.  Seriously. It was the very first thing I noticed... everything is relatively cheap, compared to other restaurants like Friday's, Applebee's, etc... I don't like those restaurants for their bland food and overzealous prices. And there's a large selection of different appetizers and entrées. What a THICK menu!!  Our server, Lindsay, (sorry if I'm spelling your name wrong), was unlike most servers we've had before. Her serving style was so...blunt? There wasn't any artifical sweetness, no flattery and small talk...it was almost as if she was serving us as we were her aquaintances, so she didn't need to put on all those unneeded frills. It was honestly strange at first, but then I found it to be quite refreshing. I've worked at Fleming's for a little while and it reminded me of the regulars and servers interacting as friends...not as a tip-fishing waiting staff serving a customer. But anyway... way off track. The BLT salad was good... I wanted more blu cheese :'( but the portion size of the toppings were correct for normal people. The bread bowl with tomato bisque I ordered was AWESOME... Not a traditional dinner by any means, but it made me very happy. All of our food came out relatively fast. The salty caramel cookie... (I forgot the exclusive name of the dessert) was HEAVENLY. I freaking love the salty sweet combination and it was just perfect. So perfect.  Our server took great care of us, and we'll definitely be back. The hostesses up front should appear/act more friendly and attentive. There was a group of five or more staff members idly chatting away with each other as customers left the restaurant.

Morgan P.,"Dayton, OH",0,5,,5.0,12/10/2016,"BJ's is a pretty good corporate restaurant chain, nothing that's super different than Cheesecake Factory or a business like that. However, what makes this particular BJ's at Austin Landing extraordinary is one of the main bartenders, Bijohn (not sure of the spelling of his name). Every time we come in we make an effort to sit at the bar because we know we'll get great, HONEST reviews on beer and food, as well as great conversation and just an awesome personality. BJ's is slightly overpriced in some categories, however the rewards system on our phone makes up for that with the coupons and deals offered quite frequently. But in totality, I go to BJ's for a cold IPA and to chill with Bijohn. Sometimes I get a pizzookie.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-miamisburg-2?start=40

Very bland and just plain boring! I couldn't even get past the 2nd one.  Then for my lunch I ordered one mahi mahi taco and one shrimp- again lacked major flavor! I ordered a side of rice pilaf rice wasn't even cooked. I was very dissapointed AGAIN. I wish I didn't have to give bad reviews wherever I go!!! I'm just being truthful!

I had ordered the jalapeño burger and my wife ordered the cherry glazed salmon.  We both enjoyed our entrees.

I ordered the calamari, it was swimming in grease to the point where the batter was sliding off the squid. The squid was slimy and tough to chew. My boyfriend got the Mac & Cheese and it was seriously lacking flavor. The bacon crumbles didn't even taste like bacon, it was basically noodles with a side of grease.

The beers came within minutes of ordering and the salads shortly after. Both of which were good. The pizza was excellent! Deep and loaded with toppings.

The wings would be on this list, and they are plain not good. Basically, go for deep dish pizza and decent beer; but sit at the bar if you want a chance at decent service.

Sherry E.,"Springboro, OH",70,138,199,3.0,10/30/2013,"I have been here twice since this location opened and each visit was satisfactory. Our food was prepared adequately and the wait staff were average. BJ's reminds me of a typical chain restaurant; maybe like a cousin of Applebee's. Several selections varying from burgers to pasta, and even pizza. My favorite experience has been the cookie dessert. A personal pizza-sized baked cookie with ice cream on top. Mmmm. BJ's has a large beer selection that the franchise apparently owns/ brews in some location unknown to me and ships to its restaurants. Although the beer is a somewhat neat and unique marketing ploy, I find the experience a bit over saturating. IMO, a beer crafter finds a style of beer and perfects it. BJ's has attempted to create every type of beer on earth. It makes their beer expertise feel too diluted. A side note to the manager: you would make more money off of me if you offered happy hour to the entire front of the house and not just the bar. After discovering that dinning room guests are excluded from the benefit of happy hour, I have vowed to never buy beer or an appetizer during happy hour.

It is very clean and the TVs are not overpowering. They are there and you notice them but you are not forced to look at them all the time.  Food: Average and pricey. See above for what we ordered. Service: This being a chain restaurant I know that service is hit or miss. Either you get a good server or you do not. In this case, we did not. We had to ask for water four times before any water was served. The waiter seemed very rushed and did not offer ideas or explain what BJs was all about.

Aimee P.,"Springboro, OH",35,3,9,1.0,11/14/2014,"Went to BJ's to celebrate signing the lease of our new apartment with my new roommate.  SERVICE-We were not told ahead of time that Happy Hour specials were served only in the bar area. So after sitting ten minutes in the dining room waiting for someone, anyone, to take our drink order, we flagged down a server and asked where we could find a listing for Happy Hour. She responded that we needed to be seated in the bar to receive those and seemed annoyed that we asked. We moved and were quickly greeted by a new server. She started out really strong with great service, unfortunately that level of service dropped off as our visit grew longer. She became less attentive with each question we asked. It got to the point that we decided to end our visit even though there were more items we wanted to try. We felt rushed and not welcomed.   FOOD-the menu is pretty good sized, maybe too big for its own good. It took quite a long time for our appetizers to come out once we placed our order. I have been in the restaurant industry for 25+ years and know it shouldn't take a half hour for apps to come out. I had the California Club Flatbread. It was ok. Not great, not terrible. The blend of flavors was good, but the amount of toppings was off. The avocado was nearly non-existent. I had a glass of the Berry Burst Cider, and that was definitely the highlight of the evening. It was fresh tasting and filled with delicious fruit flavors. This cider is well done! But once again, I think the beer menu may be a bit ambitious as it offers so many variables it can be difficult to decide. For dessert, we split the peach cobbler and it was simply divine, but it took entirely too long for it to be served.  ATMOSPHERE-The restaurant is clean and well maintained. It is what I would call classy casual. Nothing stood out as unique or exciting-just a nice looking, shiny place to eat. Overall, I was extremely disappointed with BJ's. The food is not worth the price we paid for it and the service was simply not up to par. I was expecting a lot more bang for my buck, and as such, will not be making a return trip unless it happens to be on someone else's dime because they sure will not be getting another dime from me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-miamisburg-2?start=60

Amber C.,"Meridian, ID",38,75,34,3.0,9/27/2013,"A group of us from work went here for lunch. They have been pretty busy all week: this is the first week they have been open. They are in the new Austin Landing development, next to Panera.  We went fairly early to try to beat the lunch rush. The place was starting to fill up but there were lots of open tables still. The wait time was ok, (just over five minutes) but the communication between the hostess and our party was pitiful. We were unsure of where to go or what to do based on her half-formed responses and then she basically just ignored us.  The restaurant itself is very nice inside, with lovely high ceilings and dark wood furniture. We did not go in the bar area but it looked nice as well. The staff was attentive but there were so many of them all over they were tripping on each other. I assume that this is a ""first week"" issue that I am assuming is due to training and guessing at needed staff levels. I hope so.  Our server was a very friendly at first, although he seemed to ""get lost"" half way through our meal and then managed to turn from being very friendly into almost rude when resurfaced. The servers are obviously all still learning but the bussers and runners managed to ""serve from the right and pull from the left"" although our server did not. Normally that type of thing wouldn't even occur to me but they are aiming for a fancy look here and the hundred other people who came to our table (we honestly had at least 5 people running back and forth serving us and such, it was a circus at times) all did it so it stood out when he didn't. I will give all the million and one servers credit however: the manager was walking around checking on tables (lovely) and wasn't quite shy about correcting any of them in front of everyone (not so lovely).  The important part: the food. I had the roast beef dip sandwich with wedge fries. The fries were ""eh""...a typical wedge fry. Not much to do to make them amazing or horrible. The sandwich was great, even though I had forgotten to ask for it without cheese. The roast beef was delicious and the bread, although much too ""doughy"" was a good complement. The horseradish sauce was phenomenal: simple yet just perfectly tasty. The au jus was cold when I got my plate and the cheese on my sandwich was as well (it was melted, but already cold) which leads me to think it was probably sitting for too long before getting to me. It is still a sandwich I would order again, with the exception being I will get it without cheese and with the string fries instead. My co-workers all enjoyed their meals as well. Three of them got the flatbread/salad combo, and it looked light and delicious and fresh and is definitely a good choice for a lighter lunch. Two others got the quesadilla, which looked very nice and was well plated. Both seemed to enjoy it as well.  Only one person tasted a beer, a Blonde (hey, it was a working lunch!) but he said it tasted fine.  The end of the meal ended with our now impatient and smart-alec server dumping a glass of water on two of us. Sigh.  Overall, the food was very good. The lunch menu is a great option and a decent value, the rest of the menu is way over-priced for what you get. The service could definitely have been better, but given it is so new, I am erring on the positive side, believing they will iron out the wrinkles and lose the attitudes once they gain more confidence. It took us an hour and half to dine there and part of that was almost ten minutes of waiting for waters/drinks! Again, I am hoping that a bit more time will smooth out that time issue as well, as it is not an option for a working day lunch for those of us who have an hour or so.  I will try them again in a few weeks and go with my son and without a schedule in mind so we can relax and enjoy it more.

Our food was decent, nothing spectacular. We were seated in a lower level booth with other booths above us, where we could not see what the other diners had ordered. After eating the table above us that I could not see had ordered some sort of fish that smelled amazing. When I asked the served what they had ordered, she replied, ""I'm not sure I'd have to see what it was"" and then walked away. Now, if I had just wrapped up a dinner with guests who have not yet paid I would go above and beyond what it takes to ensure a good tip.

Are you kidding me?  The food is a mediocre attempt at making American fare.  The southen fried chicken is two thin chicken cutlets breaded, over fried to dryness and served in 45 minutes over pasty mashed potatoes.  The chicken pasta was a pasty  mess with some broccoli thrown in and no real discernible seasoning or taste.   Cheeseburger has no flavor and despite menu description of being served with thousand island dressing none appeared and the server was perplexed as to what to do.   Finally the beer.  Having been to many microbrewery pubs the first requirement is that the glassware is ""beer clean"".  Fastest way to tell if they are beer clean is the amount of head when poured.  Of four beers ordered at the table not one had a head on it and no effervescence.  When questioned the server said it always looks like that.  Sure cannot tell if the beer is any good but it sure goes flat quickly.   I cannot tell if the crowds are because it is a new restaurant or if the time to turn over a table exceeds two hours.  Stay away from this place.  If you go don't say you weren't warned.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-miamisburg-2?start=120

Brian C.,"Dayton, OH",83,282,26,3.0,11/20/2013,"When I write a review I hate to compare one place to another but the whole time we were here we kept thinking how much BJ's is like the Cheesecake Factory except with pizza and beer. The decor, menu, even some of the food items like the avocado springrolls are very Cheesecake Factory-esque. The place was packed, took us a few laps to find a parking spot but once inside the wait was 15-20 minutes and we were seated in about that time so not too bad. The beer selection was great, not quite as good as Chappy's Taproom (sorry, another comparison!), but pretty danged good for a chain! The service was friendly and prompt and our avocado springrolls came out pretty quickly. We ordered the deep dish pizza which is their signature dish (we ordered the gourmet meat version), and it was served shortly after we finished our appetizers. Overall the pizza was pretty good, not our favorite in town but pretty solid. Our favorite part about the pizza though was the crust, it was reminiscent of the old school Godfather's Pizza crust (dang! another comparison!), but seriously, it was light, crunchy, and buttery like Godfather's used to be way back when. For a chain, BJ's is pretty good and overall it was a solid experience. It was a little pricey, $40 for one regular sized beer, a beer sampler, a small pizza, and the avocado springrolls.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-miamisburg-2?start=140

Melissa D.,"Fairborn, OH",27,26,25,2.0,9/5/2014,Normally I have a lot to say.  Only one word describes our experience tonight: meh. Beer: Big selection! Impressive. But the BJ brand beer was pretty meh.  Tried several and nothing stood out. Drive the extra 5-10 minutes to Miamisburg and enjoy Lucky Star or Star City Breweries. Food: The food was.... Meh.  The pizza did not impress.  Say home and order Jet's.  Better value for the money.  The scallops were bland and smothered in pepper.   Service: Our waiter was nice.   There are better places to go.  Probably won't be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-miamisburg-2?start=80
Ken H.,"Mundelein, IL",1,11,1,5.0,11/3/2015,"I have been here several times.  The beer was good and the food was good. I realized when I sat at the bar that this place is even better than I had experienced in the past. First of all, the happy hour mini pizza rocks, great price, great flavor (even the crust & I'm from Chicago)!  The beer selection is far better than the printed menu suggests. This is a problem for the place since the printed menu is probably always out-of-date, but their beer selection is outstanding.   For me it's not a negative because I should know that a place like this has more than a printed menu would indicate.  They had great regional beers that I never saw in print.  While I stick to beer at what I perceive to be a beer place, the hard liquor selection looked good.  Hey, if you want great beer, exceptional bar food, in a lively but conversational locale, this is Your happy place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-miamisburg-2?start=80

Anton B.,"Dayton, OH",0,6,26,1.0,2/22/2016,"My wife and I went a week ago and although it just opened is already challenged.  Host didn't greet us just waited for us to walk up to them and ask if we could be seated.  She seemed challenged by it so we went to the bar.  2 bartenders behind bar with 4 people sitting ant the bar and it took 5 minutes to get greeted.  My wife asked about a special drink and bartender gave us menus to review.  My wife liked the Non-Alcoholic Mocktail combination of Monin Raspberry syrup and club soda and asked if she could have her vodka drink with a combination like that.  I ordered vodka and club soda.  My drink was $7.  Her drink of vodka and club soda was $7 then they charged us an additional $3 for a squeeze of the Monin raspberry syrup.  Come on, that whole bottle costs $3.  We had moved to a table by the time we got our check and asked the server to review the additional charge and we could see him walk over and stand behind the manager on the phone for 18 minutes...literally, we timed it.  When the  manager came over he wanted to debate the $3 charge as he said ""the specialty drink is very involved to make and that's why it costs the extra price""  I asked what was in it besides ice, club soda and a squeeze of the syrup.  He said it didn't matter it was just a very involved drink to make.  I asked again and he said that he didn't know but that they were very difficult to make. He then advised us that we should've ordered it a different way and we wouldn't have gotten charged for it.  He awkwardly made us feel like it was our fault and he was doing us a favor by removing a $3 charge for about $0.10 worth of syrup.   We also ordered the Brussels Sprout and they were burned and REALLY, really salty.  We were going to re-order them but server could not be found.  We were looking around for about 10 minutes when a different server came over and asked us about it.  She never apologized, she just said she would tell the server.  Calamari also overcooked and this dish had NO salt.  It really seemed that the cook had forgotten and seasoned the Sprouts twice and not the calamari.  The Club Flatbread however was very good. We won't be back anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-miamisburg-2?start=80
Karissa E.,"Maineville, OH",28,1,,2.0,2/20/2016,"Giving his place 2 stars because the food is hit or miss and the same can be said for the service. Pros: First visit.... The queso was really great, bbq brisket burger is awesome, fish and chips were excellent, drinks were to be expected. Cons: Second visit.... We called ahead and were told that it's not their policy to allow call ahead for a party of 8 and that the wait would be 2 hours even though it was almost 9:30 by the time we arrived and not a prime hour for business... called back and manager informed me that 2 hrs was an inaccurate assessment and they would try to get us seated since we were giving an hour notice. Fair enough. Arrived when no one was waiting and was seated within 30 min which is much better than the original 2 hrs quoted. My husband ordered the sirloin med-well and it came out dry and closer to well-done. I ordered the Santa Fe salad and it came missing several items such as cheese, corn, and tortillas on top. The food was dropped off by runners who quickly ran off without asking if we needed anything else. Waiters are always running around when it wasn't even busy and acting put out if we asked them for something. When we finally caught the waiter who was avoiding our table, we kindly asked the for another steak and they obliged but it came after everyone was finished eating. We weren't given anything for our trouble but an apology which is great and all but when you can't even enjoy your meal with your family and have to hurry up to eat after everyone is finished, what's the point? To summarize.... This place is great if you want just drinks and appetizers but don't expect excellent service and get used to having to flag down your server if you need anything because they've probably checked out by the end of the night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-miamisburg-2?start=80

Jamie A.,"Hamilton, OH",22,147,23,4.0,5/17/2014,"Good food and friendly service! We went on a Friday night around 6pm... The place was packed and we had to wait about an hour for our table.  Our waitress (Elizabeth) was incredibly sweet and chatty. We had drinks and an appetizer not too long after we sat down.  I had the Jack's Berry Lemonade - it was a strong drink and a little too sour but still really good. My husband ordered a Long Beach Ice Tea that he wound up not drinking (said it was too strong) and luckily, they took that drink off our bill.  The drinks are expensive. They were all close to $10 each - which I didn't realize until after I had ordered a Strawberry Splash (frozen and delicious!) We had some mozzerella sticks that were a little lacking in the cheese department but the breading was so good, you didn't notice too much.  We split a deep dish pizza with pepperoni and italian sausage. I LOVE their pizzas. So, so good.  Over the years, I have had a wide variety of items from their menu and have never been disappointed with any of it.  Our service slowed down significantly halfway thru the meal but the place was still busy. Our waitress was absolutely the nicest at all times.  We took most of our pizza to go but it was worth it.  2 boozey beverages, root beer, salad, mozzerella sticks, and a large deep dish was over $70 plus a hefty tip. It was an expensive meal but we were celebrating with friends and it was worth it. I would recommend going for lunch as their lunch specials are much cheaper!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-miamisburg-2?start=80

Ryan H.,"Portland, OR",5,43,22,2.0,2/23/2014,"Well, this is another case of money spent making a place look good, but forgetting that the food should BE GOOD. We ordered avocado spring rolls as an app, there was no crunch, a mouth full of mush, needs to have some chunks and something to give some crunch, maybe some rice noodles.  Entrees were spaghetti and meat sauce, and some kind of creamy chicken pasta dish. The meat sauce was so bland, and thin. None of the sauce stuck to the noodles, and it was so boring. The creamy dish had rigatoni or penne and chicken, the noodles were grossly overcooked, inedible, we had it taken off the bill, my wife left hungry and had stop at Panera on the way home for something to eat. On top of bad food, our server was MIA most of the meal, so other than a nice looking dining room there is nothing to this place.

So Valentines Day where do we choose to go ... BJs! We find that they had a menu change and my trusted favorite pasta was gone . So I order a steak cooked medium well with a little pink through it. We wait (a long time) but we have a appetizer so .. It's all good. 2nd steak comes out ... I cut it and the waitress says OMG there's no pink in that steak again. Now I'm a little frustrated but just ask to have it removed. The manager comes to apologize but when the bill is brought to me they charged me for two steaks and only remove one (neither were eaten)! Wait again to have it removed .. We get our bill and I'm thinking Geez ... At least comp ONE of the beers ... Nope! We paid our bill .. Left and guess what ....
