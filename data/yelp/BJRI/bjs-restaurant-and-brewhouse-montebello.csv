Victoria R.,"Valencia, CA",0,15,2,1.0,11/13/2017,I called to place a pick up order and the guy transferred me and left me on hold for 6 minutes and I finally hung up and called back. Then i was on hold for another 5 min so I gave up and placed the order online. I got there after the food was supposed to be ready by and no one greeted me and the food still wasn't ready. When I got the food the chicken was disgusting and cold and there was a piece of cilantro in the ice cream.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello?start=20

yoonji l.,"Los Angeles, CA",70,39,,1.0,8/9/2017,The hostess today was by far the rudest.  I've never had an encounter with one as bad as her.  It wasn't even busy and we were not rude so I don't know what her problem was.  She should work in the back.  Our food came out 45 minutes later.  It was just a pizza and salad.  People who sat after us got their meals before us of course.  The waitress said it's because pizza takes time.  Then the pizza should be HOT. NOT COLD.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello?start=20
Maria C.,"Walnut Park, Los Angeles, CA",22,35,35,3.0,11/26/2017,Slow service! We had to scarf down our meals and had to take the delicious Oreo Pizookie to go because we ran out of time.

Anthony H.,"Los Angeles, CA",45,1,1,1.0,8/3/2017,"To be honest one of the worst experience I have ever received at a resturant. Our server seemed uninterested in attending us let alone take out order. The food came out in an odd order. We got apps 25 mins later one entree and 30 mins later the last two entrees. I joined the member program and to be honest only thing that gave me service. We used a coupon code to get our free pozoki and we never received it. Had another code for $10 off and it wasn't applied. Had to walk to the host stand to get my check from the supervisor. When I toled him about our experience and our service all he did was apply the code I presented. No other action was taken. Food 1/10, service I can't rank because we didn't receive any. Overall experience we won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello?start=20
Angela R.,"Los Angeles, CA",228,4,,1.0,7/19/2017,"So I've never had complaints about this location until now. My brother and I got there and it was fine, we ordered our appetizer and we waited 30+ minutes for ALMOST cold chicken wings. We let it slide, it's a busy day. But it was not the end, our waiter also barely attended us to ask if everything was okay or if we needed anything really. Anyways, we ordered our dessert, 1 macadamia nut pizookie and 1 churro with ice cream which took another 30 minutes which was delivered by someone else and the ice cream was looking more like a pool that a solid scoop.  BUT THAT WASNT ALL, when I tried to get a scoop of cookie I began having to stab it and even then it would not come apart. So i had to tell Nicklus our waiter the cookie was super hard and he brought another one. Luckily it wasn't another 30 minutes but rather a bit over 5.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello?start=20

Service : 10/10 The food : 10/10  Atmosphere 10/10 I was really shocked!  Since I was a first timer, I decided to order a little bit of everything.  We ordered :  - Appetizer -A mini deep dish pizza (11$) : my only regret was not getting a bigger one lol  -Dinner-12 oz Ribeye w/mashed potatoes, veggies and shrimp. It can with a claim chowder (30$) : The meant wasn't chewy and it was literally cooked and seasoned PERFECT. Also comes with a free pizookie  -Jambalaya (18$)  : spicy and not shy with the chicken and shrimp  -Dessert- warm white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie. Worth every calorie !

Diane C.,"Monterey Park, CA",70,1,,2.0,7/20/2017,"I started patronizing BJ's in1999 at their Westwood location when I would order lunch for our office staff 2-3 times a week.   At the time, although they'd mess up the order 75% of the time and offer a free lunch the ""next time"", which was an awesome deal for the office, pretty much all of the salads were excellent, especially the Garden Medley Salad with Blackened Chicken. Sat at the bar last night and ordered their Santa Fe Entree Salad with Blackened Chicken.  The lettuce in the salad consisted ONLY of the Ribs of Romaine, no leaves!!!  Who the heck does that?  While I realize they may use the leaves for burgers and sandwiches, I hardly think that the remaining ribs should be all I get for $13.75!  I saw a photo on another review of a salad with only the romaine ribs too, who in management decided to tell their cooking staff to do this?  Really poor decision... I think yesterday was the last time I'll ever consider ordering an overpriced salad with poor ingredients here again.  In fact, maybe I'll just go with drinks at the bar, at happy hour or, maybe NOT!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello?start=20

Robert V.,"Monterey Park, CA",401,54,20,2.0,11/14/2017,"Went there for lunch, was in the mood for a pasta. I got the jambalaya, my better half got the chicken and asparagus. We also ordered some avocado egg rolls as an appetizer. The egg rolls are not the same as I remember them. They have a new sauce in them, with like a spicy sour cream flavor. Not good at all. We get our dishes and for some reason hers is actually steaming and mine is barely even warm. The bite I took tasted as if it was coated with black pepper, no other flavor at all. It had a couple bits of sausage and 3 tiny shrimp, I asked the waitress why is it not steaming like her plate? She said I can put it in the microwave for you! I was like ok... While we waited I got a bite from my girls food, it was supposed to be penne pasta, we wondered why there was so much spaghetti noodles in there lol, we left most our food.

Jennifer C.,"Los Angeles, CA",46,133,215,3.0,9/18/2017,"Went to go eat on Sunday night. We saw one family was waiting. I asked the front how long is the wait and she said 20min. Really?! I see a lot of open tables and booth. I guess they were short on staff. We went ahead and got our selves seat at the bar. Bar had couple open booths plus tables. Even though they cleaned the table, there were still crumbs on the table and chairs. We looked at menu for good 5 mins and was waiting for a server to stop by. Couple of sever pass by but none of them stop for us. 15 mins later, server came by to take our order. We figured if we order just drinks, she won't be back for another good 20-30mins so we ordered everything at once.  10 mins later, a male server came by to drop off our appetizer. Appetizer came before the drinks... The drinks didn't even come til 10mins after. I didn't like their hibiscus tea. Didn't taste as I thought it would be. Our food arrived about 20mins after munching our appetizer. The presentation and the quality of the food was decent. Since my food was a little greasy, I needed refill on my drink. I put the empty cup by the corner so that our server can see but non of the server weren't generous enough to ask me if I wanted a refill. Couple mins later our server came back and I told her I would like refill.

She catered to me right away not even there for 5 minutes. Take in mind the entire bar was full. I got a few items off the lunch menu. It was easy and good. She filled my water up every time without me asking. She definitely was on her A game.

Laura S.,"Bell, CA",5,52,59,2.0,4/27/2017,"I have had unpleasant experiences at this Bjs, the times I've been here with friends.  Both times I see that the waiters take on more parties than they should. First time we were there he forgot to bring us our coffee and pzookie we had to ask again.  Second time there Michael was told there was a birthday I think he forgot about us because he just returned to give us our credit cards and that was the last time he was seen at our table. In shorter words please don't take on too many parties, then you provide bad service to others and in my opinion this isn't fair.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello?start=20
Chris C.,"Whittier, CA",2,18,,2.0,6/19/2017,"Came here yesterday for Father's day, which I knew I shouldn't have, but the misses insisted. Wait was about 40 minutes, it was expected. Server was nice and friendly, I chose the jambalaya which he recommended, it was smothered in white onions and too much sauce drenched the rice pilaf. There was powdered pepper all over side of the plate, as if whoever prepared my plate was in a hurry. Was far too spicy for my liking, I couldn't really taste or enjoy. Very little meats. Left more than half the plate, all vegetables and sauce.   I usually don't like coming here because the food isn't the best. Should have gone for a pizza of theirs instead. They did give out a Father's day glass and a 20% VIP card to use NEXT visit. Lol they could've just let you use the 20% for Father's day there and then.

We have a large party and the server is not attentive at all. I understand it was busy. But she never come and check on us after we ordered our food and like other people mention here the food come in odd order we got one entree and the rest of the 8 people's just have to stare at one dish? When I told our server they forgot to put avacado on my taco which I know it's a add on. She gave me attitude and I was shocked.

Grace C.,"Monrovia, CA",272,841,720,3.0,6/23/2016,"One of our default spots for lunch outings if 1) we can't think of where to go; 2) we don't want to go far; 3) we have a sizable group; and/or 4) we want to appeal to everyone's taste (some people consider Asian cuisine too exotic). One of the downsides is that you'll get slow service no matter what time you go. I typically order the seared ahi salad if I'm feeling in the mood for a light meal (ahi with baby field greens, napa cabbage, romaine, red bell peppers, tomatoes, avocado, pickled cucumber, cilantro, wasabi, wonton strips and green onions, tossed with rice wine vinaigrette). If not, I like their lunch flatbread and soup combo (margherita fresca and clam chowder). Plenty of mall parking.

Ricardo S.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",0,3,18,2.0,2/14/2017,"I really don't understand why people go crazy for BJ's restaurant. I stopped by last Friday with my best friend, and we didn't have the best experience. It was disappointing and disheartening since he really likes this places and comes here quite often. The restaurant was clearly understaffed that night for all the people that were there. We waited for about 10 minutes, and our waitress wasn't all that friendly. Then it took her another 10 minutes to deliver the drinks after we placed our order. The food took too much time to arrive as well and yet no apologies at all. I was really hungry, so I must say that by the time my food arrived, I was really cranky and the dinner ruined.

Reasonable prices, friendly and attentive service, fresh items (crisp salads), and a willingness to cheerfully make a substitution (I can have rice pilaf or baked potato in place of fries for example) make this a great place to dine!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello?start=60
Nicholas A.,"San Jose, CA",332,55,137,2.0,8/20/2016,"When attending a chain restaurant - there are two things I look for: consistent food quality and service.  Food Quality - consistent with other Bj's that I have visited through Northern and Southern California. No complaints on the deep dish or thin crust pizza that was ordered.  Quality of Service - if you made it to this point you are probably wondering ""why the 2/5 stars?"" Well the service was below any prior experiences that I have had at a Bj's. Long waits during each stage of the meal required proactive flagging down of our waiter or other staff walking by the even get the enough plates or sets of silverware on the table. Drink refills. Getting the bill. Paying for the bill. Slow. Slow. Slow. Fortunately the food came out at a good pace. Thank goodness for that!  Gonna pass next time I considering going to this Bj's location.

James K.,"Davis, CA",41,64,,1.0,9/4/2017,"All the reviews you read here about the service at this restaurant are true. The service is atrocious. I came here on a Saturday to celebrate my mom's birthday. It took ten minutes for our server to take our order for drinks. It took ten minutes for the drinks to show up. We had to place our food order with the hostess (who was extremely nice and far and away the most helpful person) since we were seated in a table near the front. Literally the hostess would be the only person we would see for large periods of time. Drink refills were few and far between and took ten minutes to get.  The food was ok. My garlic green beans did not have any garlic and were burnt. The ribs were good. My mom's ziti had several tablespoons of fat in the bottom. It's probably from the pepperoni that is in it. They don't render some of the fat out or use a leaner pepperoni so the dish was swimming in fat. Wife had the Cobb salad, which she said was decent.  After we were finished eating we asked for my mom's birthday pizookie. We waited and waited and it never showed up. Asked for the bill. Saw the free pizookie was charged to us. Had to have that taken off. The hostess helped to take the pizookie off and she brought us out a pizookie to go with an apology. Our server was slow and incompetent.  With all the negative reviews pertaining to service you would have to guess it's a systemic problem. This stuff reflects poorly on management who I would think is the real problem. Either they don't know how to train staff or they don't know how to schedule their employees (or both). It shouldn't take well over an hour and a half to eat dinner  (unless you want it to of course).

The kids love the pizza but I recommend the Ribeye steak. It was super juicy and tasted fantastic. All the appetizers are great. My fave are the avocado egg rolls. And the blackened salmon is another go-to meal for me.  The place does get busy in the evenings and weekends so you can expect a wait. They have an app that you can use to get on the wait list.

My entree was jambalaya with a side salad of tomato and mozzarella. My fiance ordered spaghetti and meatballs. I would take pics but the restaurants lighting is too dim and I'm not fond of using a flash. Now I usually order the same stuff at every BJ's and sometimes I send stuff back when it tastes terrible.

Mei M.,"Monterey Park, CA",752,120,3805,1.0,4/28/2016,"I was very disappointed with the service tonight. One of the reasons we decided to go to dinner there tonight and not Fri-Sun was because we thought it would be less crowded and therefore better service. While the first part was correct, the second part was not. We were promptly seated and abandoned by our server (or so it felt at least).  Our server would disappear for long periods of time. I understand (in talking to him) that 3 servers called in sick that evening. So our poor waiter was left running around covering more tables that he normally does.  We requested apple juice for my niece a few times with our main server, once from a supportive server and once from someone who seemed like a manager of some sort. We waited about twenty minutes for our main server and supportive server to bring the juice. Our main server told us once he had to go check on if and the other time he said he did put in our juice order but that juice came from the bar and they had not done it yet. I know the bar was working...as I saw plenty of patrons in the bar and surrounding tables with alcoholic drinks. Maybe our juice was made a low priority since it didn't make them as much money as the alcohol. After waiting twenty minutes with no juice we asked a manager for it and got our juice in 5 mins, right after our main server finally brought us our juice. Then we asked for soy sauce for my niece's rice, that took another 15 minutes to come up. Tonight's dinner was more waiting than eating which only took away from our family dinner experience.  In the end the short staff was paid by a flustered waiter running around and hungry people at their tables. People hungry either from waiting for her food (if they were lucky) or waiting for their server go take their order (as was a majority of the tables. It would have been nice had management had a contingency plan in place to avoid such occurrences next time so that restaurant patrons don't have to pay the price of the restaurant being short staffed.

Kristina K.,"Montebello, CA",43,84,17,4.0,12/28/2017,"Dined in after a very long hiatus and was pleasantly surprised by their revamped menu. Some signature items were still available along with a broader range of burgers, tacos, pasta plates, and other varied selections. I went with the classic Cali chicken club and the rest of our table went with some flat bread pizza, Turkey burger, shrimp plate, tacos, and the appetizer plate. Everything tasted great and was as expected. Loved the fries since I wasn't into the former wedge and thin fries they used to offer. Pizookies are always on point!  Service was really great and he was so patient with our group. Some of the helping staff was a bit clumsy and not as friendly, but I couldn't do what they do, so not judging.  Overall we had a good time! I recommend getting to the restaurant around 6pm for dinner so the wait isn't as long.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello
Carmik T.,"Gilbert, AZ",70,384,751,3.0,10/8/2017,"Not the service we generally receive from BJ's. Came in to dine about 6PM. A 25 min wait.  Our server took our drink orders. I asked for a water with lemon, that request wasn't followed through. We started with the chicken wing appetizer. Very  late arriving to our table. Meals ordered were the BJ's Brew Burger, The Pork Chop and the kids meal ( for bigger appetites)  Chicken & Rice. Our meals arrived and they brought the wrong kids meal?! It was a Alfredo Pasta instead of what she originally ordered. Chefs had to remake our daughters meal & by the time it arrived,  we were half way done with ours! They didn't comp it, nor did we get drinks replenished through out our dinner. Many delays from service to cooking staff.  Hostess station seemed to have been running smoother' Food was good.

Juan H.,"Pico Rivera, CA",351,212,89,4.0,10/4/2017,"The family and I came in on a Saturday afternoon. My daughter had just finished up a performance that was given by Simon Mall in honor of Hispanic Heritage Month.  We decided to go to Bj's since it has been awhile that we've been there. We were seated fairly quickly as it did not look busy. There were some tables that had large parties but it seemed manageable. Our server was Maria and although she was great at helping us with our son's order, her overall attentiveness was lacking. Again I don't know if she was tending to one of those other larger parties, but I must stress, when she did give us the attention, she was awesome. We ordered calamari and were impressed at the sauces and flavor of this dish. The kids ordered their own pizza and as I said earlier, Maria was very accommodating with my son (he's 2) in ordering a pan style pizza rather than a deep dish. We also had some wings with two sauces. The wife and I got a burger each and it was very filling. Overall we will come back and patronize. Anytime you can spend with family is time well spent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello
Abel B.,"Los Angeles, CA",396,84,1363,4.0,11/9/2017,I felt like not eating at home.  I live in East Los Angeles and without a doubt there is great food all over.  But I was feeling a bit more commercial last night so we decided on BJ's.  Aside from having poor service in other BJ's this one has certainly provided good service every time we have visited.   I had a pulled pork and bacon burger which was too much for me to finish.  The offered unlimited fries for $10.  It was a deal.  I noticed that the fries are air fried which is good if your heart conscience.    Anyways this spot has always been good to me so it comes highly recommended.  Food and beer always good here!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello
Brian P.,"Montebello, CA",33,92,171,4.0,9/12/2017,My reviews solely based on the food because it seems like everyone that's leaving reviews are throwing shade on the workers. Place is usually pretty packed on the weekends but if your eating out in Montebello the choices are pretty limited. For large parties I suggest you make reservations or come early and put your name down and browse around the mall. The restaurant has a lot of drunk patrons as well so if that's not the environment that you anre seeking with your family than this isn't your place. Pizzas are really good especially the thin crust. Jambalaya is a bit pricey but that would be my all time favorite! Their beers are awesome and fresh because obviously they brew in house. Overall not too bad unless you have high expectations so just go in and grab a brewski and relax. Life is as hard as you want it to be.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello

Jeff L.,"San Marino, CA",131,337,836,4.0,4/3/2017,"This BJ's is in the Montebello mall.  It's fairly big and there's tons of pokestops in reach for all you pokemon trainers that are still playing.  This is a pretty standard BJ's, food is great.  The pizzas are great, the pizookies are a must get dessert.  Their sandwiches and other dishes are also really good so they're worth trying if you're not in the mood for pizza.  I got the California chicken club this time and it wasn't bad at all.  The sandwich is what it sounds like, chicken club sandwich with avocado.  It came with a side of fries.  I would also recommend their root beer too which is worth trying out. On occasion they'll have a 2 for $x however much it is now, and that's usually a pretty good deal, you get a soup/salad, medium pizza, and a pizookie.  So be sure to take advantage of that deal whenever they have it. Download their app and you can make reservations through it.  You can always call ahead as well, since they get pretty busy you won't have to wait as long.  There always seems to be a wait here so being able to skip the line is always a plus.  Apparently you can also pay for you bill directly at the table as well so that's another benefit that our waitress informed us about.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello

We came for lunch and we were seated swiftly.  Our waitress  Kristian was friggin 'AWESOME'!!!!  I have NEVER had as good as service at any BJ's as we did with Kristian in Montebello.   Kristian was extremely warm, polite, made sure everything was perfect and it was genuine, not an act.  I told her that the entire BJ's staff should be trained by her for customer service and how to interact with customers.  Simply the best!!!! We ordered our food and we tailored it to our liking and it came out as ordered to perfection.  This has 'NEVER' occurred at a BJ's for me. The Prime Rib dip was perfect with the sauteed onions and green bell peppers.  Made it close to a Philly sandwich.  It was perfect at all levels.  Taste, consistency, exactly enough onions, and peppers as asked for.  The salads were also done as we requested, perfect. The chicken club was also made as ordered and was delicious.  On this visit, it appeared to be that the QA was finally being watched at this establishment which was so refreshing. Good food, AWESOME service = great customer experience at BJ's!  A recommendation to BJ's management, get Kristian in a lead role to train your staff.  Kristian gets it!!!  IT is hard to find, don't lose her!  :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello

Ken K.,"Jacksonville, FL",24,289,23,2.0,8/30/2017,"OK - 1st off, I hate Yelp reviews that ding staff  too much (The server did not make eye contact, yada yada, yada....) and don't focus on food, because as long as you're not blatantly rude, I don't care. BJ's was blatantly rude. I travel on business, and don't drink on the road (being in and out of germ tubes knocks down immunity, and I always get sick if I drink on the road) - I walked into a 3/4 empty BJ's and asked for a small table...The hostess asked if I wanted to sit at the bar, I said no (What's the use of being in a bar if you're not drinking? I just wanted a quiet meal) She then said, you're by yourself, are you sure you don't want to just sit at the bar? No, miss....I'm 46 years old, and quite certain I know where I want to sit.... So I get a table......and wait....after what seems to be @5 minutes with no one coming over, I set my timer and thought to myself, ""I'll give this place 5 minutes"" At 4:26 (now @10 minutes) someone finally came over - I ordered a diet coke and a flatbread. Diet coke came, someone other than my server brought flatbread (very good, BTW)......I sat with my rapidly empting diet coke with no interaction from server at all - for @15 minutes - server finally came, with check, asking if I wanted a refill, by this time, didn't bother... said no thanks - she drops check - full price for flatbread (1/2 off on Mondays....) - she snootily agrees with me, comes back with corrected check.  Now I know 1 guy, no drinks taking a table not good for a server - I would usually tip 25% of full price - but in this case, gave 15 and left.

Vincent Artemio E.,"Monterey Park, CA",66,126,624,5.0,9/19/2017,BJ's is an ideal place to meet with your friends especially after work. It's also an appropriate place to meet for a first date because the menu is geared towards small meals or large entrees or simply drinks. It's easy to slip in and sit near the bar or wait for a booth or larger table. The menu is a bit inflated in that there are too many choices. I usually order a seared salmon salad which is always fresh and delicious. The dishes here are not overly prepared or massively proportioned but there are so many choices that you have a difficult time choosing exactly what to order. The service here is excellent. The one time our order was late (very late) the manager came out and explained and apologized to us and provided us with a complimentary item. It was a very busy night and I appreciated that the manager took the time to see that we were satisfied and not feeling neglected.

At this point the kids were hungry we didn't want to go elsewhere and wait another 30 minutes so we waited. 20 minutes later again we ask what the hold up was and we were told the server still wasn't back and ""they must be running late"". How the heck is that our fault. At this point our toddler was screaming and kids were very hungry and inpatient as we watched at least 10 other parties get seated. I asked for the manager and as soon as I asked for him we were seated. Manager apologized but the kids were already freaking out hungry, fussy, and we were so frustrated it really ruined our experience. 2 stars because our server Brandi was very nice and brought out ""children's starters"" right away for the crying, hungry, toddler (she was very friendly very quick and did great) but we were already left with a sour taste in our mouths after the terrible service.

Connor F.,"South El Monte, CA",0,7,,5.0,1/11/2018,"I've been here two times this week and despite the rudeness from the hosts up at the front I had very pleasant experiences once I moved past the box of rude girls (your job is to greet me and make me feel welcomed, don't act like I'm inconveniencing you because you have to stop gossiping with your co-workers). Anyways, both times I sat in the bar area since the host directed me there because they probably did not want to move from their spot to seat me in their nearly empty dining room. On my first visit I sat at the bar with my girlfriend. We were promptly greeted by the bartender Shelly.  I ordered a beer and my girlfriend was uncertain on her drinks so Shelly asked my girlfriend a few questions on what she liked. She asked if she could just make her a cocktail so my girlfriend agreed since she was  so indecisive. My girlfriend went over the moon for her cocktail! We ordered some appetizers and she suggested some items off of happy hour since it was going on.  The avocado egg rolls were amazing! I would have to say better than CPK.  On my second visit with some friends, we sat with an older gentleman in the bar area. James was very warm and welcoming unlike the girls in the front.. even though I think he forgot about our drinks from time to time.. his positive attitude and attentiveness made the whole experience a great one!

Vic C.,"Duarte, CA",107,2377,8717,4.0,1/14/2015,"This BJ's Restaurant is located at The Shops at Montebello (formally the Montebello Mall), specifically located right next to JcPenny.  (Review is for To Go Order only)   Decided to make a to go order for lunch for both my husband and myself this early afternoon. I called to make a to go order before leaving work (I work pretty close by this place) and was told my order would be ready in 15 minutes. This is what we had: Mahi Mahi Tacos- ($9.50 prior to tax) I had the option of having my mahi mahi tacos grilled or fried and decided to opt for grilled (healthier option). This entree comes with 2 tacos and chips (with avocado cream sauce and fire roasted tomato salsa packed in a separate container). I really liked my mahi mahi taco. The chipotle mayo added a little spice to it (which was plenty spicy for this non spicy eating person) but my husband added a bit of sriracha to it. I thought the fish was nice and tender. The shredded Napa cabbage and carrots added a nice crunch to it. The chips were just ""eh"". I have had better chips from the market.  Kale and Roasted Brussels Sprouts Salad- ($9.75 prior to tax) This salad is pretty good with the different flavors and textures. Not only is there kale and roasted Brussels sprouts but also blueberries, sliced red grapes, dried cranberries, candied pecans, chopped cucumbers and toasted pepitas. This salad also comes with goat cheese and red onions but I requested to omit this. I love the sweetness and flavor from the fruit and the strawberry vinaigrette enhances that light sweetness throughout each bite. My dressing automatically came on the side since this was a to go order, but if I dined in, I would normally ask for salad dressing on the side (don't like my salad swimming in dressing... kind of defeats the whole purpose of eating healthy).  When I arrived exactly 15 minutes later (told you I work close to this BJ's location) after I placed my to go order, it took another 10 minutes to pick up my order since there was a person ahead of me making an order and the computer system was moving slow (according to the employee who was helping me with my transaction).  Making my order to go over the phone was easy, along with pick up. I like that you can also have the option of making a to go order online as well, but I didn't want to use my cell phone data to do that for this visit. (They have free, fast WiFi here by the way). Overall, had a fantastic lunch with my husband at a price that was reasonable.

This is the first time ever coming in and leaving with anger and confusion.  We came in on Friday night and was told that our wait was about 20 minutes; but instead, my friends and I waited over an hour to be seated. It didn't really bother us because it was a bit crowded so it was understandable.  But what confused me was that no waiter/waitress came up to let us know that he/she would be serving us that night. We looked around and tried to flag down a server but were ignored countless times. One worker stood by the pos system while the other 5-6 waiters were on the other side near the stairs just talked amongst themselves while they stared at the customers. Excuse me? My friend raised her hand to get service but instead of being attended to , she was completely ignored by the waitress even though we clearly saw her eyed our table. What I don't get was that if she wasn't our server, why couldn't she let our server know that we are ready to order? We sat there for over 30 minutes plus the hour we've waited for our table. We were all hungry and pissed off so we stood up to leave. As we walked out, not one server gave a damn and just watched us leave. What a complete waste of our freakin time.

Elizabeth G.,"Pico Rivera, CA",257,7,,1.0,9/2/2017,"My review is a accumulation of visits into one. This is by far the worst BJ's location. Only thing giving it a star is the conveniency of the location as a meet up point for my friends. Waiters and server are just terrible. One visit, I ordered a mini pazookie took more than one hour to receive it. I had the same waitress twice after that and never had a good dining experience with her. Another visit, we never got a refill on our drinks until after we were done eating. Oh and once we were done eating the table was never bussed. The empty plates sat in front of us for at least 20 minutes before we finally got the attention of our waiter. (We were so kind enough to stack them on top for him *sarcasm) Another visit, the waitress kept forgetting everything, mixed up orders, and etc. The manager even admitted our table wasn't the only one who made a comment. It was not a good experience. So yeah this location is a no for me and has been for awhile. I recommend BJ's Downey location. Best to management.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello?start=100
Janelle G.,"Monterey Park, CA",52,252,56,1.0,1/1/2016,"This is my first time at this BJ's. The service is HORRIBLE!!!! I couldn't keep track of how many servers helped us. One girl sat us down, another came to our table, who claimed to be our waitress. A few minutes later another waitress came and said she was taking over for our first waitress. We ordered our drinks, which took about 20 minutes to get. Some guy brought out our drinks, another guy brought out my soup, then ANOTHER guy brought out our entrees. My deep dish ziti was not so ""deep."" It was basically a few noodles with a gob of cheese with a cup full of grease on the bottom. The ""waitress"" never came to refill our drinks or ask if we needed anything else.  The tables are ridiculously close together. It can't possibly be safe in there if an emergency happened!!!!

Came here late night after work with a girlfriend, and our server Ephraim ( pretty sure not Ethan) was really cool. He told us how to get the $10 of a $35 bill on our phone and was super upbeat and friendly the entire time.  I ordered an ahi tuna salad and told him not to include a bunch of things, as I'm a super picky eater. When I received my salad and began eating, I noticed there was still some cilantro inside. I don't know if he forgot to tell them, or they picked it out shoddily, but I absolutely can't stand the taste of even a little bit of cilantro. I didn't want to be that difficult customer, but I ended up telling him and he was super cool about it and said he would take it back and bring me something else. I really liked that he didn't make me feel guilty about being so picky or act annoyed. I then ordered the flat bread, which was pretty good !  All in all, I had a pretty good experience here, and was pleased with what I ordered as well as the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello?start=80

Charlie A.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,19,9,1.0,11/15/2016,"I don't even know where to start with this review. First off today is a Tuesday (11/16/2016) the restaurant wasn't that packed so the service shouldn't have been as horrible as it was. My family and I walked in close to 6pm. We got seated and a couple mins later the waiter came and took our drink & appetizer order. We were off to a good start or so we thought. The drinks arrived and the waiter took our entree order. 15 mins later and still no sign of the appetizer or the waiter. Our entrees arrived but they forget my son's plate, we remind the waiter about my son's order and we tell him we no longer wanted the appetizer since it arrived late but he comes back and tells us it's on house (great right?). At this point the service still sucks since the waiter hasn't even offered refills on any of the drink orders, my husband calls the waiter and asked him for refills. Waiter comes back and this is where it all went to shit. I ordered an ice tea, it arrived and I start to drink it but my straw isn't picking up any tea, so I decide to stir it and that's when I see a big nasty glob of slime! If you have ever seen what placenta looks like picture that in your ice tea! That's what the glob looked like. We were so disgusted and puzzled as to what the f*%# this slimy glob was that we didn't take a picture. My husband calls the waiter and asked the waiter what the f*%# that is. The waiter is even more confused and disgusted than we are! He takes the ice tea and says he will find out. He comes back and couldn't tell us what it was but he apologized and said it was going to be taken off the bill! Ummm sorry but NO! You would think the manager would come and apologize and try to make things better. At this point I couldn't even finish the rest of my food. We had to call the manager over he gave a lame apology and couldn't even explain to us what the protocol was when something like this happens. I'm sorry but if it would of been a fly or even a roach in the ice tea at least we would of known what it was but the fact that this slimy glob was in the drink and no one could identify it is utterly disgusting and unacceptable. The meal was comped and we filed an incident report but I rather had paid and not had to deal with this. Never going back again. *Update it's been a MONTH and no one from Bj's has contacted me and that's okay I posted this all over social media and none of my friends & family will ever be stepping foot at any BJ's location. The lack of urgency goes to show what they think about their customers. Thanks Bj's!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello?start=80

When I was getting towards the bottom of the salad, I noticed that there was so much dressing it looked like soup.  The friend I was with ordered a burger with a beer.  We had to flag down the server to ask for another one (isn't it the servers job to make sure to ask).  My friend was not fully done with his burger when the server dropped the check.  I looked at her and said that we haven't gotten his beer that we ordered and that my friend was still eating.  She didn't seem to be concerned or care at all that she made us feel rushed.  Again, it was not busy at all.  Im not sure who told her it was proper to drop off a check when someone is still eating and waiting for another beer.  With this said, I don't think I will be eating at bjs anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello?start=80

Last night we went to the one in Montebello since we were close by with friends. We sat in the bar area in a booth and we ordered our drinks and the waitress comes back to take our order which was 2 calmari, hot wings and small ribs. The server brings one order of calmari. A few minutes brings the ribs then my boyfriends gets up to find the waitress and oops she only got one order after we repeated the order smh then the server brings the hot wings which was supposed to be an order of 10 and there was 8 1/2 .... really! So my boyfriend calls the waitress to show her there is only 9 and a 1/2 of another and she picks up the plate and says I will get you another one with no apology. Then they bring the calamari she forgot and minutes later the wings so by then we were eating cold calamari smh I was irritated and hungry so we just ate. From the time they brought our first plate to the last was almost 20 min! When you order together they should bring the food at the same time. This was my worst experience ever at any BJ's and I would have called the manager to complain but we were running late for a concert in Anaheim. Great wings and cold calamari!

Despite how busy he was with tables, he was quick to act on every request and checked in on us frequently. He even put us at a larger booth without us even asking which was amazing. Highly recommend! The 2nd time (2 days later) I believe we had Cheyenne according to our receipt. She didn't introduce herself, nor was she anywhere near as receptive or alert to our table. We had 2 different items that came out either with something we asked to remove (no lemon in waters, both came with lemon) or with items we asked for extras of (additional garlic knots). When she brought items to us, she dropped and walked away so quickly we couldn't even get a word in. It ended up prolonging the visit longer than we wanted because she was always moving too fast for us to ask anything.  Definitely ask for Daniel if you go. Great server!!

Genevieve G.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,73,40,3.0,2/19/2017,It's a great place to eat if you go when they open.  If you go after 5 pm it's busy and you will get wonderful service from Valerie- or Maria - but if u sit towards the back where restrooms are the service tends to not be so great .  Try to be seated  next to entrance I notice those tables get served faster and better. If the woman manager is on duty service is probably going to be good .  The food is delicious order over phone if u don't want to wait to be seated and served . Lunch portions are big and inexpensive.  Drinks are good  .  It's just ok service if it's after 6 pm - depends who takes care of u . Val is the best server !!!

Sergio G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,76,,1.0,11/17/2017,"Beware this BJ's has the RUDEST and clueless bartenders. I've been to quite a few BJ's locations and the Montebello facility employs by far the most unfriendly team of bartenders. I can't quite figure out why the bartenders have such a shitty attitude. Not sure if they have a crisis in their personal lives or if they're just plain idiots that need to be re-trained pronto in the area of customer service. Whatever the case may be these individuals are too complacent in their role at work. Obviously their IQ level is rather low that they can't quite comprehend that patrons are the ones who pay their salaries and patrons are the reason why their sorry ass isn't at the unemployment line.  I strongly recommend to BJ's management to dissolve the current bartending team and hire a crew that is professional, attentive and appreciates the business from paying patrons!

I get we had a very large group on a busy night so we expected the service to be a little slow but to wait 30 minutes for a beer after asking for it 2-3 times, 40 minutes for checks and being over charged for stuff that wasn't ordered. And the service was flat out rude. I was engaged in a conversation with my husband and one server came with a drink and set it right between us and didn't even have the decency to pour after she behaved to rudely(it was a split of prosecco) Its clear that the servers here are poorly trained and/or overworked. These servers need to be retrained in the art of customer service.  The food was ok. We ordered nachos and wings. There was no guac on the nachos so we ordered a side of guac. The guac had CELERY in it! Who puts celery in guacamole!? A cheap ass restaurant trying to stretch ingredients and skimp on quality, that's who. I sent it back and the server tried to save face by saying, oh its a mix that they put in. Uh no bitch, that shit was ground up and mixed in. Clearly, in an effort to stretch it out. At least try your shit before you serve it. Also, celery is not a typical ingredient. What happens when you serve that to someone with an allergy to celery? Good luck with that one.

I don't know if my expectations are higher or I was just naïve, but BJ's just isn't that great anymore. The servers are always very courteous, but not very attentive. Last time I was there our server came 4 times and we were there for like 3 hours. First time for drinks, second time for food, third time for dessert, and the last was for the check. Maybe it is their policy not to bother their diners too much so they can enjoy their meal in peace or they are just under staffed. Either way, I think they should check up on all their diners more often.  My 3 star rating is mainly cause of the food. First the food takes forever to come out! If you are looking for a quick meal before going out or watch a movie, this is not the place to be. So make sure to grab one of their house beers, which are pretty good, sit back and relax. I have had a lot of different main courses here - pizza, burgers, and pasta. Every main dish I have tried here is extremely salty yet still pretty bland.

Amelia L.,"San Gabriel, CA",6,19,,2.0,4/27/2017,"My experience with BJ's has been up and down, never consistent. I had visited this restaurant with my family before and received exceptional service. I don't understand why this time was different. Our female server, don't know her name but she wears glasses, was enthusiastic at first and seemed prompt and friendly, but her attitude gradually fell along with the service she gave us. We ordered two hickory barbecue burgers, a parmesan crusted chicken, a salmon entree, a sandwich, and a large pizza. The pizza was the first to come, which took me by surprise because it usually takes the most time to arrive. Twenty minutes had passed and the entrees started to arrive one by one. I ordered a well done burger and I received medium rare. My dad's sandwich hadn't arrived yet, but the table next to us ordered the same sandwich and his arrived first (even though they were sat 20 minutes after us). I think they made a mistake and gave the sandwich to them instead. After the food arrived, our server stopped checking up on our table. We saw her jumping from table to table, but never checked up on us. We had to wave down a bus boy to ask where my dad's sandwich was because everyone's food had arrived. 30 minutes later, we decided to ask for a manager and he came to our table. We told him that my burger was made incorrectly, and didn't receive the sandwich. Another 20 minutes passes, but at this point our server was avoiding our table because we complained about our service. We thought she did it on purpose because she felt embarrassed. But my question is, she is our server and if she made a mistake, she should be the one to apologize for the inconvenience. Why was she acting like a child by avoiding us. She kept checking up on the surrounding tables, but never made an effort to stop by us until the very end to drop off the check. They took off the sandwich from the bill, but we told the manager there was no need to do that because we weren't looking for a free meal, we just wanted our food. We did appreciate the effort, but it came too late. Instead of making up for it at the end and apologizing, make the moment right and do something about it when the time comes. We could have gone to other restaurants, but we chose this one because of a previous experience. This is unacceptable.

Basically stay away from anything that requires some culinary skills. Its safe to stay with the fresher menu items such as their salads as they're required to keep things fresh.

Due to my baby wrecking havoc on my normal eating habits, we shared a pork chop plate (2 pork chops, green beans, cheesy mashed potatoes), which was pretty solid.  I would have preferred a better apple sauce, though.  We also shared a personal-sized buffalo pizza, which was kind of salty and a touch dry.  Finally, I had a coupon for a pizookie, and we got the salted caramel one since I have tried the others.  I didn't find it that great -- it seemed like a white chocolate macadamia nut cookie with some drizzles of caramel sauce over the ice cream.  It stuck to the plate a lot and wasn't warm and gooey like I had hoped.

We came at 6 and the line was already about 30-45 minutes long...I guess there's a lot of early hungry shoppers. The employees were nice and helpful, and the menu selection is extremely vast. I got an ahi tuna salad, and for the most part, it was enjoyable. However, the tiny dabs of wasabi were extremely strong--I know they're dabbed on the sides of the plate, but I didn't see it til I swallowed the first one clinging to a random leaf. I would suggest transforming it into a dressing or doing something else to alleviate the strength of the wasabi--I love wasabi, but this was pretty intense. Also, there were several slices of tuna that tasted overly fishy...to the point where I wanted to gag. I really didn't want to finish the rest of the fish in fear I'd get another bad slice, but I just swallowed and hoped I wouldn't get food poisoning.  The bf got a deep dish pizza, and he LOVED it. The toppings were spread all the way to the edges of the crust, and the fluffy dough complimented the rest of the ingredients perfectly. Verdict? It's okay...moreso for the bf than for me. Personally, I wouldn't want to come again because I keep thinking of those nasty slices of fish, but the bf definitely wants to return.

Melissa Z.,"Monterey Park, CA",134,4,2,1.0,11/26/2016,"Alright so the first time I came to this BJ's it was with my friend. We were seated in a booth, which was pretty cool. Service was good, good was great everything fine. Which is what the star is for.  SECOND time I came here was tonight with my family for my brothers birthday. So, we wait about 5-10 mins to be seated which is no problem. Then they seat us at this small table next to the pilar where all the waiters walk so that was annoying. My mom wanted a booth to put her purse so she didn't have to hold it, but we decided to stay.  Then, our waitress comes and says ""I'll be right with you for drinks I just have to greet this other family"" or something like that. And we never see her again. We sit and wait and watch everyone else get drinks, food while we sit there hungry and irritated. Then another waitress comes, and you can tell she was not our new waitress because she took our order on the back of a receipt. We order drinks and food because we've been waiting so long and were hungry.  Another 10-15 mins pass and still no drinks. Finally we get them and we drink, and wait another 10-20 mins now and as soon as we were about to get up and walk out, they bring our food. Then the part of the table that is extra and folded under falls and hits my mom right on her knees. We ask for the manager who had the best attitude of the night and fixed it. My mom asked a waitress for mustard and I promise she looked at my mom like she was from another planet then went ""...yea"" and left. So rude. We ate and waited again for the birthday pizookie for my brother which was not that long of a wait. He eats that then we leave.

Medz H.,"Montebello, CA",16,35,30,1.0,11/8/2015,"When will restaurants figure out that service is just as important as good food? It seems that most of these places figure that if the food is good then people will comeback no matter how lackluster the service is.  What is even more surprising is when bad service seems to be a regular complaint on yelp and its never addressed. The reason for my rant was, my wife and I know that the service at this location is slow but we were hungry after shopping at the mall and gave in. I honestly have to say this most recent trip takes the cake. Not only was the service horrible, but the food made us stand up and leave( I will get to that in a second.) When you walk into a restaurant, you expect to be greeted in a happy, polite manner. In this instance the hostess never said hello nor made eye contact with me. After standing there for a minute or two I finally said ""I need a table for two"" at which point she asked for my name and putt a pager on the counter. 15 min later she yells out my name even tho I have a pager( which was never used). We get guided towards a table by a someone  who seems disoriented and couldn't decided which route to take. During this this walk she must have asked us at least 3 times how we were doing but kept turning her back to us before we answer, just plain rude if you ask me. We finally get seated and a few mins later a different person came to take our drink and appetizer order, she is friendly! So we give the order and get our drinks... We ordered chips& guac with a side of salsa( not to random) she brings us chips and guac then vanishes. We have no napkins or utensils, and start looking around for help... 15 min goes by and our real server appears ( I have no idea what her name was because she never said it). I explained we needed that stuff and also that we asked for chips, guac and salsa but didn't get salsa... ""Oh you ordered two?""she replied. WTF? No, we were just missing the salsa I told her. She leaves a bit confused and then we see he talking to the nice girl that took that order and looking our way. After a few minutes pass the ""nice"" girl comes and brings two little sides of salsa ( you know the cups they put catchup in) what the hell will we do with this?  We each ordered a mini pizza and side salad. My wife got a caesar which looked like it had no dressing at all and  I got a house with ranch( mine had a dollop of dressing) both were pretty sad even for a side salad. We eat those and wait for another 20-25 mins for our pizzas... They finally show up and both are not fully cooked. When the pepperoni on top of a pizza is still soft and pale colored you know something is off. We called the manager( who was understanding) but who seemed to have this speech down pat! ""Cooks didn't make it right and I'm sorry for the service"".. We offered to pay for the drinks and appetizer but he said no. At this point we left.

I was also bothered that a very young couple sat down next to us and he served them alcoholic beverages without asking for valid forms of identification to verify their age before serving them liquor. We got up and went to the hostess to explain what had just happened at the bar with the rude condescending waiter that booted us out of his section. I asked what we should do as far as seating because we still wanted to eat there. The hostess did not try to accommodate us or apologize for that server's actions.

Cristian G.,"Pomona, CA",85,22,1,1.0,7/16/2017,"This place is pretty sad. My wife and I are new to the area, and were happy that there was a BJs Brewhouse in our neighborhood. Welp, we weren't happy for long. We arrived here about 8pm on a Sunday night. The place was not too busy when we arrived, but I couldnt help but notice that it was in disarray. There was quite a few pieces of trash on the floor in every direction I looked. We waited to be seated. I headed to the bathroom to wash my hands, of course in here there was trash all over the floor as well. So I went back to find my seat. I noticed when I sat down facing my wife, there were a childs hand prints all over the booth right next to my wifes head. It looked like the booth wasnt really cleaned. On my side there was trash on the seat. Anyways we were just there for dessert, and would be on our way shortly thereafter.  The waiter took a little longer than expected to arrive. He took our order for one chocolate chunk pizookie and left. He brought us some water shortly after. It took about 20 mins for the pizookie to arrive. Once it was delivered we never saw our waiter again. We ate the dessert and waited, and waited. No one came to bring a check, or see if we needed anything else (we were never given napkins). So after waiting for about 15 mins i just left cash on my table and we left. I did look around to see if we could find a manager. I tried to get his attention but he was busy chumming around with some of the wait staff. Poor customer service here, especially for something as easy as dessert. The entire restaurant looks very unclean. And not much can be said about the management. I would give zero stars if I could.

Amy P.,"Los Angeles, CA",1357,850,1153,2.0,7/12/2013,"On Tuesday, I had made a reservation for yesterday (Thursday) for a party of 12 at 7pm. There is a 20 minute grace period after your reservation before they seat everyone present and give up the rest of the tables. Thankfully I tricked my friends to thinking my reservations were at 6:30 and we would lose our tables by 7pm so we were all here on time =) They almost hated me but .. who could hate the birthday girl?! That's just cruel .. We were seated promptly. The boys went to grab some beer at the bar since there was still 10 minutes left into happy hour. Our waitress was meh. No one else said anything about us bringing beers back to our table but she gave us a hard time - probably because she wanted our bill to add up so she would get more tip. Our food came out in a reasonable time -- 20 minutes or so for the deep dish buffalo ranch pizza. It was just okay. Asked to connect a empty table right by us since we were expecting 2 more people. Our waitress said she would ask and never got back to us. We asked another server and he came back within minutes to help us connect the tables. At the end of dinner my boyfriend told me he told her it was my birthday but she also never brought out the pizookie. Not sure if its because someone in our group ordered their own pizookie seperately? ROOOOOODE.

Our waiter was polite, kind, and nice. Only complaint was that service takes way too long. We were able to flag the attention of waiters. We didn't have our silverware and it did not arrive about 5 mins after one of my friends had received his salad appetizer. Our waiter only came to check up on us once (he was really nice though) on how we were doing. Food was delicious. That alone gets 5 stars from me. Started off with the mini bruschetta and finished off with the Brewhouse Black and Bleu burger. Definitely a top 8 burger.

I waited another few mins and another young lady came and asked for my name, said she will be right back with my food. She also gone and never came back. The line was forming and a gentleman came and asked if I need help. I explained that two ladies went missing in trying to get my food and he apologized. He asked for my name, confirmed my order and went back to get me my food.....This time he came back, told me all my food are in two bags in front to the side. Waiting on the manager to confirmed a coupon. She came and helped me out and asked the male server to make sure all my food are there and he said yes. I already paid, said thank you and went home...... Then I proceed to grab my favorite Clam chowder soup, I love this so much I ordered two. I opened the first one and it's was mashed potatoes. I ordered one so no biggie...but there were only two white containers. I thought both were soup. I then opened the other, also white, but not soup. Yes, it's also mashed potatoes. So I ordered 1 mashed potatoes and 2 clam chowder soups and i got 2 mashed potatoes and no soup...no biggie. I tried to call the place first to correct this. I was hung up a few times and was trying to get to someone for a good 35 mins of trying, I went to eat my cold food.....and after that? I am here writing this review. You guys owe me two clam chowder soup, please make some effort to provide them as I did paid for them...Also, if not too much trouble....someone to answer the phone to talk to would be so helpful.

We then had the shrimp scampi, burger and a new dish in the menu, fire roasted barbacoa chicken.  The bazooki 3o was very good. Not to sweet except for the macadamia one which was a bit to sweet. The chocolate chip one was very good as well as the 3pl chocolate not to sweet, crunchy edges and soft center toped with ice cream made this dish AMAZING! The stuffed mushrooms: now this dish I absolutely loved a crunchy top soft center and drizzled with pesto sauce the taste was very flavorful. I recommend this dish!!! The salad: we very much enjoyed this this dish. Tomatoes were fresh and the flavor was great! The shrimp scampi: the shrimp were delicious with almost a buttery taste to them and the pasta was soft and delicious too but had too much black pepper.  The burger on the other hand was perfection the meat was juicy and a great flavor. The fries with a crunchy thin layer on the outside and soft on the inside had a delicious flavor.  The chicken dish: according to our server, this dish was added last week and I can say it was very good! The chicken was soft with a crunchy crust but the best part was the flavor, very juicy! The service: everyone from the front till our server were very nice. But our Server Jeff B. was what put the cherry on top. He was just great and a delight!

I had some encouragement to flag the waitress and let her know she had ordered the wrong fries. I tell her.

Alan K.,"Monterey Park, CA",472,653,10,4.0,10/3/2012,"3.5 Stars, if you will. I like this establishment, I have a few problems with this place sometimes; but at the same time they try to remedy it. I feel so confused about this place because my overall experience here can't be described as consistent. FOOD QUALITY: Do I like their food? Well.. yes. I think they're above-average quality in their pizzas and most of their dishes. Clam Chowder is always a delight to eat. Pizzas are pretty large (but not the best tasting). Sandwiches I feel could shine more if they tried; they taste and feel like average sandwiches. Open-faced burgers are HUUUUGE and flavorful; their pastas are unique but I feel are overpriced. Jambalaya is super oily for sure (thank you andouille sausage.)  To this day I still don't know how or why their baked potatoes are monstrous-sized.  To this day I still think PIZOOKIES are the best thing to eat here.  SERVICE: Hit or miss! I do notice that a lot of times my waiter/waitress disappears for some time to the point where I feel like once I have his attention I have to get everything I want done in one go or else I will never see my waiter again. ENVIRONMENT:  It's pretty spacious in here. Dark. Loud & noisy. Seating is generally comfortable but I disagree with a few of the table arrangements because I dislike having to look forward only to see a family eating in booth seat.  It's very convenient to have a BJs at the mall, so I'm glad that it's just around the corner to deliver some quality dishes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello?start=280

Got to the restaurant and nobody greeted me. Hostesses are no good, just told me to wait until the take out girl gets there. Finally about 20 minutes later I paid for my order. I didn't get my food until 12:07 when I was suppose to have the food for important meeting back at work. When I finally got back to work I realized the sides and soup were missing. I hate to be a bitch about stuff like this since I understand it's the peak of lunch hour but this order was for a lunch meeting at work and for someone to not eat during a lunch meeting it just made me look really bad.

Adell L.,"Monterey Park, CA",2,49,,3.0,9/23/2016,"My family and I had a birthday dinner at BJs (9/21/16).  The young man serving us was nice and helpful, he just seemed alittle nervous.  Maybe he was new.  But not an issue.  My issue was the meal I ordered.  I asked for the Cherry Chipotle Glazed Salmon.  I've had this a couple of times before & it was awesome.  But when I took my first bite, All I tasted was SALT!  It kinda left a slight discomfort on my tongue.  I gave a bite to a couple of family members with me to make sure it wasn't just me.  They all said the same, very salty.  The server asked me if I wanted s different meal as a replacement but I said no, I'd like a less salty salmon dish.  He obliged & took my plate.  After everyone was done eating my replacement meal came.  So much better.  But since everyone was done I took it to go.  It was maybe 15 min. wait.  The server apologized & told me to ask for ""low sodium"" next time.   A major chain like BJs should serve each dish the same way every time.  You expect to get what you've had before, the same flavor.  It was funny because at the BJ's in Covina a few weeks prior, the same thing happened. I order the same dish & it was over salty.  I didn't complain at that time but I should of.  Like I said you expect to get the same dish flavor every time.  Let's hope the next time is better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello?start=280

We were seated and not once asked if we wanted to start with a drink. We waited 20 mins and had to get up to ask for assistance. Finally Michael came to wait on us. He is very nice and accommodating.

Place was pretty full, for a Wednesday night - got there around 730pm.  Seated promptly, but server didn't come check on us for 15 minutes.  The lowlights: Food too 25 minutes with cold fries, wrong salads and soup in a sourdough bowl taking another 10 minutes after that.  Fish and chips  - fish was hot but not much crunch with cold fries - wedge salad came w blue cheese when asked to omit when ordered, and sandwich, although tasty, looked like it was made at home - smooched a bit. Server either over stationed or new, I asked the hostess if this was a training store, and was told it's not.  A turned away salad (not prepared as requested - no dressing) was an obvious annoyance to the server who brought it...

I like to dip each side separately because it gives you more appreciation for the squid. I've gotten pizza the stuffed mushrooms ribs and fries.  The fries were a joke tho, I think I was served the bottom of the bag because they were so thin and small they soaked up all the grease. No good.  The ribs were good, nothing special but edible and soft meat. The pizza was very very tasty got the supreme taste as it should with good looking breading. The mushrooms are a must try just eat them warm they don't taste the same cold.

Danielle G.,"Monterey Park, CA",1,19,1,1.0,7/8/2016,"I really had much rather given 0 stars. I hate this fuckin BJs and I have no idea why I go back. I've had my share of shitty experiences there and out of the 10 times I've been there, about 6 or 7 times was only for late night happy hour and 0.5 stars only because those nights with friends are what makes it memorable -but still, even then, the service always sucked. I figured hey, lets give the morning shift a shot.(shitty idea) I went in once for lunch, service and food, sucked. Overall experience 3/10. I went again recently with a friend before engagement ring shopping = meaning he was stressed = wanted a beer to mellow out = bjs = good idea.  That shit turned out to be the dumbest idea we had. We had sat in the bar area because the there was a wait for the dining area even though it wasnt even crowded and we went a little after they opened.. um whatever, lets sit in the bar.  Sat in the bar and encountered a woman who had no smile, I'm assuming she lost it on her drive to work or something.....? Poor girl.  Didnt introduce, no hi, just - sumthin to drink...?...?........................... uh k. We ordered water to start and looked through the menu, she came back again with no emotion whatsoever and totally gave us judgemental stares throughout the entire ordering process. She seemed rushed and impatient because I didnt know what I wanted so I just decided on brussel sprouts and that I would order a meal later on. Each time we asked/said anything to her, she never said any ""I'll be back, ok, sure, no problem, thanks, i'll be back with that, i'll put that order in now"" nada- she would turn her back and dart off. It was insanely weird. Anyway- I decided I had lost my appetite. Didnt finish my appetizer and my friend never even ordered his alcohol because.. god forbid he ordered a beer with her.  At the end of the meal, I wanted desert but again.......god..forbid. My friend pointed out that in the table tent thing there was an advertisement for ""use mobile pay thru the app (for the first time) and get a free mini pizookie"" YAY! When the server came by, she brought the check= get out, no desert for you fatasses. My friend ended up flagging down a hostess and mentioned the ad and wanted to order the pizookie- the response from the hostess was ""oh thats expired we no longer honor that."" k, even tho there was no exp date even in the fine print and yet the same advertisement was all over every other table..... cool. we payed our bill, were annoyed as fuck, didnt tip, and left. that waitress didnt even deserve $1 which is saying something. I was insanely bothered still because like I said, i have no idea why I go back, but its closeby, cheap, fast, simple and i knew i would obviously go back but seriously didnt want to encounter that server again. Called the manager, complained, he seemed appalled at everything he was hearing and was sincerely sorry and said ""next time you come in please ask for me so i could make your experience better"" so hey, i gave bjs another try today. service in the dining area - server had the same attitude as the other. annoyed. rushed. could give a fuck less about her job. did i bother calling the manager? no. what for? what could possibly have turned around yet another shitty experience? ha.  also, the hostess mentioned when we sat down ""free pizookie when you pay with the app!"" screw you bjs. also i wont put up the names of the two servers who suck extreme balls cuz i dont want to put them on blast but - i hope they get their heads out of their asses sometime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello?start=180

No margaritas or martinis on happy hour menu. Only limited options for happy hour appetizers. We tried the bjs brewhouse burger with fries and it looked very delicious but my half tasted a bit odd. The bun had some crumbs that made me wonder if they used a special type of bun. My boyfriend noticed it too, but we didnt mention it to our waitress. So I decided to order the seared ahi tuna salad because last time it was excellent. Sadly this time it was disappointing. They added way too much dressing that made it hard for me to enjoy. The tuna was so so. So this time i did mention it to the server that only serving while our original server went on break. She wasnt really polite she just grabbed it off our table and tried to send out another one. As if I my comment annoyed her and she just wanted to rush off. I decided to try the avocado egg rolls and they came out slightly burned and were just terrible. I like avocado but that appetizer was just not enjoyable at all.

Garen A.,"Montebello, CA",487,679,2009,2.0,6/28/2013,"I'm sorry, but I was so disappointed with the service I got here during my last visit that I couldn't give it more than 2 stars.  The meal started off just fine. The waitress seemed involved, and we were seated relatively fast, and it all went downhill from there.  Let's start with the food. We shared a hand-tossed buffalo chicken pizza. The new-ish hand tossed pizza isn't bad, but the deep dish is way (and I mean WAY) better. I wouldn't bother with the hand-tossed. The flavor is ok ... I personally think BJ's puts too much buffalo sauce, but that's just me. I also had a side Caesar salad with chicken. It was pretty bland (I've had much, much better).  Now for the service. First the waitress completely didn't understand that I wanted the dinner portion of the caesar salad. There were four of us, we were all sharing the pizza and getting salads as well (cuz two slices of pizza isn't enough for me in my hungry mood) ... we all just ordered the salads we wanted (didn't specify dinner or side) - she brought two of us dinner portion salads and the other two side portions. Who brings two people full salads and the other two side salads - makes no sense to me - and if the waitress was confused why didn't she just ask us to clarify.  Anyway, so because she thought we wanted side salads she brought those out way before anything else (leaving us to deal with the awkward waiting until we start eating to be courteous) ... then we waited another 20 minutes for the pizza, and another 20 after that for the other two salads. At one point it had been so long since we'd seen our waitress that we just assumed she'd kidnapped by previous angry customers. The best thing was that she said the delay was due to the fact that they were 'making' more chicken (though apparently they had enough for the pizza and my salad) ... none of this makes any sense.  I won't go on ... needless to say I was really disappointed. It wasn't even that full of a night (if your service is horrible on a Wednesday, I don't want to know what Friday night is like).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello?start=180

Also every server here is walking around lollygagging while all 6 people at the front are talking to each other or texting. I think this is the most horribly trained staff I've ever seen. At this point the management should consider training properly or hiring better people, I could dine and dash because Jessica isn't paying attention.

Mark K.,"Rosemead, CA",12,111,180,2.0,7/10/2014,"Came here for lunch with my girlfriend, and the last time we were here was a few months after they had opened.  First off the food is just okay, nothing amazing just the same old menu. Second the service was okay at first but got worse as the meal went on. About only 5 minutes of getting our food the waitress comes by to tell us she is leaving (normally thats fine). Then she continues to tell us that if we want desert it has to be ordered in 5 mins before she leaves, right away this was a red flag for desert because we don't like to be rushed. After our silent pause she then continued to say the check is ready and that if we want desert we have to tell her in 5 mins, then another pause and she says ""or"" I can give you to another waitress. At this point the beginning of our main meal was ruined and we no longer wanted to order desert. Won't be coming back anytime soon, you'd think for being open for so long that the service would be better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello?start=260

Michael Anthony H.,"Glendale, CA",890,101,20,2.0,7/27/2013,"I have always liked the service and food at my local BJs in Glendale, so when some relatives came into town from Northern California, I figured it would be a safe bet to meet them for dinner at the BJs across from their hotel in Montebello.   As usual, the food was good, but the service was not as good as the food. We called about 10 minutes before walking in and gave our name and how many folks were in our party.  They said there would be no wait when we got there.  Walked in and gave the name, and they said they don't take reservations, so we waited 10 minutes for a table to open up. Waitress took our orders, but we never saw her again for the rest of the night.  Our food was brought out by other servers, and for some reason, one of the kid's orders didn't show up until 10 to 15 minutes after everyone else was served.  I even had to ask another waitress where his order was before it finally came out. Again, our original server was never to be seen nor did anyone come to check on us until we were almost done with the meal. Finally, a new server comes over and starts taking care of us, but never did advise us of any shift change, nor did she even introduce herself, but hey, we were getting full at that point, so I let it slide. Then, it happens...... The power goes out in the restaurant, and we are sitting there for 45 minutes in complete darkness with an ear piercing piezo fire alarm and flashing strobes.  In my younger years, I would have ordered a couple shots and enjoyed the light show, but we were busy catching up with our relatives.   The waitress comes to the table and advises us that she will have to manually calculate our tab and asks us what we ordered.  She returns with the homemade receipt and advises us that we are only getting charged for the entrees.  That the drinks and appetizers would be waived for the inconvenience.  Considering our drink order consisted of 3 kids drinks and one adult drink and 3 waters and the appetizer being calamari, I gladly accepted the discount.   Handed over a large bill and again sat in complete darkness to wait for the change. Waitress comes back and hands me the tab folder and quickly utters that she found my ""correct"" bill and quickly walks away.  I open up the folder and see that I was billed full price ""for the inconvenience.""

Eric O.,"Laguna Hills, CA",236,219,53,1.0,9/18/2014,"I had just come back from being out of town, and was craving a pizza from BJ's. I happened to be in the area and decided to go here for dinner. I was quoted 10 minutes, but I think I only waited 6 minutes at the most. So far, so good, right? Jessica P. was my server, and visited my table a few minutes after I had been sat. I noticed she had a large party, and several two-top tables, and it appeared she knew one of her tables personally - a lady with a small child in a rainbow tu-tu - as she was spending quite a bit of time at their table. She took my drink order and asked if I was ready to order, but I advised I would get an appetizer, but needed a few moments to look at the menu. Well, I definitely got those few moments - 8 minutes to be exact. That's how long I had to wait for my drink. I didn 't say anything, but kept that in the back of my mind. In fact, during the entire 8 minutes I was waiting for my drink, I didn't see Jessica at all. After I got my drink, I noticed BJ's had some skillet appetizers - so I ordered their equivalent of Texas Cheese fries - shoestring fries, cheese, jalapenos, pork, and verde sauce, so I placed that as an order stressing I was ordering this as an appetizer, and would order dinner later. Jessica acknowledged this and went to wait on other tables and place my order. A few moments later, I finished my Pepsi, and set the empty glass at the edge of my table - a universal sign I wanted a refill. Remembering how long I had to wait for my initial wait, I made notice of the time, and watched and waited to see how long it would take for a refill. It took 9 minutes for her to bring me a new drink. During this time, I saw her talking with the lady with the child in the rainbow tu-tu, and lean at the server station at the end of the row of tables chatting with several servers. She glanced over occasionally at her tables, but that was it. Finally, after about 7 minutes, she walked by my table, noticed my drink was empty, as were all three drinks at the table next to me, and made the comment to both tables, ""I'll be back with drink refills for you"". In the meantime, my appetizer came out, and still being without silverware, I asked someone for silverware, which they brought out to me.  A few minutes later, she brought drinks to all of us, and when she dropped my new drink off, she glanced at my empty glass - I watched her make eye contact with it - and then walked away, leaving the empty glass on my table. Gee, thanks. Because my table isn't tiny already, you're going to leave a dirty empty glass for me to look at. I glanced around at the other tables in Jessica's section and noticed EVERY SINGLE ONE of her tables had multiple empty dirty glasses. Apparently Jessica is not a fan of pre-bussing her tables. To her credit, she DID come by a few moments later and asked how my fries were, and I told her they were good, which was the truth. Although the cheese made my stomach feel weird each time I ate a bite, the rest of the fries were actually quite tasty.  I had now been in the store for about 40 minutes, and Jessica had still not come back to take my dinner order. By this time, I had finished my second Pepsi, and waited to see if she would offer to bring me a refill. She stopped by about 10 or 11 minutes later, after I had finished my fries (I now had a mostly empty skillet of fries, and two empty glasses of Pepsi on my table) and asked if I was good. She didn't ask if I wanted a refill, nor did she ask if I wanted dinner. She just asked, ""Are you doing ok?"" At this point, I just wanted to leave, so I asked for my check. While Jessica left to get my check, I stopped another employee and requested to speak with a Manager. A few minutes later, that same employee came back around and told me a Manager would be stopping by shortly. When the Manager came by, he leaned over, and asked how I was doing. I then asked if Jessica was new, and a look of ""I know what's coming next"" came over his face. I politely asked him to sit down and told him we needed to talk. He obliged, and I recounted my experience to him: my being out of town, craving BJ's pizza, no silverware, the long wait for drinks, no pre-bussing, and most importantly, never being asked what I wanted for dinner.  The manager looked upset, not at me, but at the circumstances which I had experienced. He thanked me for letting him know, and told me he would be right back. I saw/heard him talking with Jessica at the server at another server station, and then he brought me a comped check - taking care of everything ($9 worth of food/drink). I really wanted to have dinner here tonight, but after my experience, I just couldn't stay another moment. The food was incredible, but there was no excuse for the sub-par service I (and other tables) received.

We usually don't do dinner on weekends and forgot how crazy it can be which is totally understandable.  I got there a bit earlier than she did so I checked us in. The main host girl, who was not very friendly or welcoming let me know it was going to be a 20-30 minuet wait and handed me a pager. My girlfriend arrives, we get to chat, next thing you know 30 minutes are well up. Since our pager hadn't gone off we decided to check and see what the holdup was... As we walked up we took a quick glance and it was apparent there were quite a few tables open. My friend speaks to another host girl and explains that we have waited over the quote time. She looks confused. Speaks to the original unfriendly host girl who quickly rolls her eyes and said we're just gonna have to wait. Second girl says ""well it's probably going to be another 25 minuets or so.""  SQUEEZE ME? No little missy. That's where you are mistaken. We have waited over your quote time and now you're telling us to wait longer?? Manager please! Manager heads over to quickly rectify the situation. THANK YOU. Within the minute we are seated... Why??? BECAUSE THERE ARE PLENTY OPEN TABLES! We sat and quickly ordered. I should have started a count as to how many times the hostess walked by and threw dirty looks. If I had a dollar for every time it could have paid for our meals. If we weren't that hungry (or already waited that long) after a long day @ work we could've easily gone somewhere else. If your hostesses don't know how to quote times properly, trust me you're losing business!! Get new girls. Server was good, but unfortunately my food came out about 10 minutes before my girlfriend... Mehhh. I threw in an extra star because it's inexpensive, and I like the atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello?start=220

Don't get me wrong, the service here isn't TERRIBLE, but it's definitely not worth the amount of money you end up spending here. I think that a place like this, that tries to pride itself on somewhat ""gourmet"" food and drinks, should really also work on Grade A customer service as well.  Luckily for me, I haven't had just one bad experience with the service here, my opinion of the service is mostly based on the fact that every time that I've been here, the service was just not that great.  I'm giving 3 stars because I still enjoy their food & beer.  Minus two stars due to long waits (even on weeknights?!) and waiters/waitresses who rush your order, get it wrong and constantly have to be reminded to bring something you asked for.

I forgot the girls name but she was a little weird. Not friendly and not rude, just weird. She asked about my watch and when i told her where i had gotten it she made a face. I don't know why, but whatever, bring me my food!! *I understand that the calamari rings are fried, I've eaten them plenty of times. These were disgustingly drenched in oil. It was more oil than calamari GROSS! * Clam Chowder was good in salt and flavor. * The shrimp scampi had more than 5 pieces of shrimp which was awesome! The taste of the sauce was a little off, it had that burnt taste to it. Since I was hungry I ate some and took the rest home.  When we were done the girl brought back the check and kept standing around for us to pay, i thought that was a little rude, especially since we weren't done with our food and drinks. Once I was done paying She brought back my receipt and was out of our sight. We left 30mins after that. I never once bothered to check and see if my credit card was back in my purse. Went to work the next day and as i was pulling into the gas station i began to pull my hair because my card was not in my purse, little did i know my card was back at BJ's!!!!! I called right away to find out ; the girl who answered asked me a million questions just to ""verify"" if it was my card. For example: What color is the card? Whats the name on the card? What kind of card is it? What are the last four numbers on the card? What are the last three numbers on the card?... IS IT MY FUUUUUU**ING CARD OR NOT????? I was frustrated and going crazy, she finally said: ""yes its here, will you be picking it up today?""  Me: Yes! I will be swinging by tonight at 10 or 11 pm!!! Her: Not a problem see you tonight! I showed up later that night at 11:15pm just to hear ""sorry we don't have any cards with that name"" WTF!!! That was another scene!

Well, they do have some new menu items like the mini tacos, the spinach stuffed mushrooms, the BJ's baked beignet and the berry crumble. Nothing too spectacular to me though. However, I can say that the service tonight was one of the best I've ever had at BJ's! Maybe because it was Happy  Hour (3-7pm)  and the waiter was such a nice guy and the hot wings were decent!

isaac b.,"South Gate, CA",12,8,,1.0,5/21/2012,"This is a review of my experience at this location that i left on BJ's Facebook wall. Just want to share my worst experience ever at a BJ's restaurant. Last thursday, i called BJ's Montebello to place an order to go (mini pizza, grilled chicken salad, pasta and 3 soups). That was at about 11:05, 5 mins after opening. They took the order down fine and said it would be about 20-25 mins. So i drove over, got there 25 mins after i called. They said the food would be a few mins, i said thats fine and took a seat. About ten minutes after, they came out to tell me they dont have the soups i ordered. Also that their computers were down. Fine, i cancelled one soup and replaced the other one with a soup they did have at the time.  As all this was happening, several customers came in after me, picked up their food and were out. So i had now been sitting there for about 20 mins. I eventually had to get up and ask for my food. They said, since our computers are down, we cant remove the soup from the bill and just stared at me, maybe just waiting for me to say thats fine? The employee helping me had a very poor and rude attitude. I could tell she was very frustrated, but that is no reason for them to take it out on a customer, especially one that has been waiting for over 20 mins for food ordered over 45 mins before. So she eventually took the soup off the bill by using a calculator like i suggested, she took a carbon copy of my credit card and just handed me my bag. No sorry for the wait, sorry for the inconvenience. Nothing! I did not receive a receipt, and to top everything off, when i got to my destination, The chicken on the grilled chicken pasta was badly charred, and no i did not order the blackened chicken, and they did not throw in the side of buffalo sauce i ordered for my pizza, which was also made very sloppy.  I have been going to bj's for years, and only once or twice been disappointed, but i have continued to go, because of the awesome food. But after this, it will be a long long time before i go back to a BJ's restaurant. And i will NEVER go to BJ's Montebello, even if lunch is paid for by a friend.  Please take a look into the opperation at this location. My sister, for whom i bought the food, also says she's had poor experiences at that location. Her and her husband also refuse to eat there.

Let's start with the hostess, I don't remember her name exactly and I wish I took it down but she wore eye glasses...  I know I know that doesn't really narrow it down but whoever she was, she had to be one of the worst hostesses I've ever experienced at a restaurant.  She did not even say one word.  After she was assigned to us she just expected you to follow her without acknowledgment and just stood by a table without telling you directly that it was your table.  Sure I guess these are little complaints but communication between an employee and a guest would not hurt. So just like the BJ's in Burbank we had to wait in between 15-20 minutes just for someone to ask us if we wanted anything to drink.  Because so much time had elapsed we were also ready to order our food but they just left once they took our drinks down...  WTF?!?!  So another 20 minutes passes by and our drinks finally arrive and our main order is finally taken down...  Another 20 minutes and we were finally in pasta heaven... See... I do love the food quality from BJ's but the service is so close to $4!T it's not even funny...  We had an apathetic hostess and literally waited in between 50 minutes to a whole hour just to enjoy a meal...  If I would've known this was going to happen I would've just eaten at the Jack In The Box down the street and gotten my food within 5 minutes to enjoy...

Jessica X.,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",186,201,282,3.0,9/5/2011,"I came here after a long day of shopping with a friend just to get something warm and delicious in our tummies. The food court was closed, so we resorted to eating at BJ's. After being quickly accommodated to a booth near the bar, we ordered the small deep dish pizza: half great white (creamy alfredo sauce with mushrooms and tomatoes all over chicken breast) and half portebello mushroom (flame grilled portebello mushrooms with balsamic vinaigrette dressing all over caramelized onions with balsamic glaze). It all came out to be ~$16 w/tax. The Great White was a bit disappointing because there were no pieces of tomatoes or mushrooms on it.. unless they all magically jumped to the Portebello Mushroom side. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best. The chicken tasted plain. It wasn't seasoned at all and I suppose the ingredients in the pizza should have ""seasoned"" the chicken, but you can taste how bland the chicken was. The Portebello Mushroom was alright, but that's because mushrooms is one of my favorite toppings on a pizza. It was good, but I feel like with a name like Portebello Mushroom, they should have put a generous amount of mushrooms on the pizza, but when it came, all I saw was a pizza with a couple slices of mushroom here and there drizzled with balsamic glaze over it. They were a bit skimpy on the mushrooms. If you think the small is too small because it only comes with six slices, you are wrong. My friend and I had two slices left over because we were way too full. Don't forget it's a deep dish, so there's plenty of crust all around to fill you up. The service here started off wonderfully, but ended tragically. It's like they wanted us to stay and didn't want us to leave because when it came down to asking for a to-go box and the bill, they took half an hour!

Good eatin' with that there. Oh and give their mojitos a shot too. No drink on their list is a wrong choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello?start=340

I've moved from Temecula less than a year ago and the BJs there does not compare to any other in this area. This is my family first visit to thus location. Our host sat us in the center aisle where is the busiest. Problem is that I have a 3 yr old girl and a 6 month old boy that we don't like to sit on high chairs for safety issues. We asked to sit on a booth and the hostess was kind enough to accommodate us on a booth at the far end of the restaurant by the restrooms(I did not mind that). The waitress came to take our drink and appetizer order but we went ahead and order our main meal along with appetizers. We received our meal and drinks, no appetizers. The waitress completely forgot about our appetizers. Any other place would've gave us a free lemonade or something for the trouble.

I ordered Parmesan Chicken. Some way or another, my waitress can mess it up and bring me Chicken Parmagiana or something of that sort. I tell her and she gives me the worst attitude ever with annoyance in her voice and her eyes rolling! To avoid missing my class, I say, I'll just keep it, even though I'm furious. Good thing, the manager came over and apologized and tried to fix things! (he's the reason why I'm not giving it 1 star!) He took our appetizer off the bill and  we just paid for the entrees that were ordered. The order I got? It was horrible. After I ate it, I literally felt nauseous. The chicken wasn't even chicken.

I came here during your dinner rush recently and didn't even stay 10 minutes because the hostess is by far one of the worst hostesses I've ever encountered. She barely looked at me while I stood there and seemed to be extremely upset and annoyed to be there but the second a coworker would come around she was all smiles. I don't understand why she'd be positioned to greet your guests with such a nasty attitude. All she said with a monotone was how many before she brushed us off and said gimme 10 minutes. Maybe you can find a position for her in the back of house. She was about 5'5 glasses, dark hair, dark brown skin when I asked for her name she rolled her eyes. No I'm not lying she rolled her god damn eyes like if I was asking to split a $10 check 17 different ways. She replied in a very annoyed tone and said her name was Marlene. Sweetheart, you get paid to be a hostess, do your job or quit. This is a business, a corporate company you work for...get it together or ask for a different position.

Probably more. The food at this location is ok. The avocado eggrolls come with this way too sweet dip. I'd suggest light ranch instead. The new portobello pizza wasn't good at all surprisingly. They usually do good with their pizzas but this had no flavor and was dry.  The pizookies here are usually a little under done. I like my cookies a bit more cooked.

Otherwise this review would have 0 stars.  We went to this BJ's a while ago when they had the 2 for 20 deal (that deal is back now). We were immediately seated so we were really happy to start off with. Who gets seated right away in a BJ's on the weekend, right? But we should have known better than to get all excited because we didn't have to wait.  After being seated, we had to wait a good 20 mins for our server. And we could see her going back and forth to the table right across us. She finally came and we gave her our order right away and told her we were going for the 2 for 20 deal. Then a good 30 mins passed before our soups showed up. Now here's the thing.....we barely put our spoons in the soups and this guy showed up with our pizza. I'm sorry, but I don't like eating cold pizza. I would like to have enough time to finish my soup. Anyway, we took a look at the pizza and saw the pineapple was missing. The server came along and we told her the pizza didn't have pineapple. She said she could bring it on the side! Who eats pineapple like that? A side of jalapeños, I understand, but pineapple?  We told her it was okay and that we don't need it on the side. We finished eating and then played the waiting game again. It took her 40 mins to show up at our table. Till then, the server helping the table next to us got our ranch, chilli peppers, and water. Our server showed up and we ordered our dessert. We got done with that and we waited again. After 20 mins, she came with our bill. How much was the bill? 46 dollars. This time I didn't even bother waiting for her. I just called the other server and told her we had ordered the 2 for 20 deal. She apologized and fixed our bill. Right then, our server showed up and I told the other server I would rather tip her than our server. And I did.  My boyfriend even sent BJ's an email. But they don't care!  Pathetic customer service. And it's only at this one that we always get bad servers. Go to West Covina.

I have a BJ's closer to home but since this one is located in the mall, I like to bring my mom for lunch and do some shopping. Lunch hour is our favorite, I completely understand when it's a full house, people coming in on their lunch break but I'm not exactly sure if they were under staff but being a frequent customer I noticed a lot of new hires and not one person seemed to know how to balance themselves. The host in front was too busy talking about her personal life with her co worker, my mom handed her our BJ's member card and gave us a poker face and told us to hand it to the waiter. Our waitress was alright, not good not bad. They brought my moms soup and forgot about mine. Not once did they come to us asking if we were fine, seemed like not only our table but the ones around us needed to wave our hand just to get a waiters attention. It took a lot for us not to get up and leave, as we watched others do so. Finally our food arrived and it looked half assed. At this point I just want the check, unfortunately that took over 20mins to get. To only person who made eye contact was the bus boy. After we were handed the check, no one bothered to pick it up, we walked to the front and the girl sent us back to the table. I wanted to pay with my card but I got so impatient I used cash and left it on the table.

He wanted something to munch on with the drinks so I suggested the chicken potstickers and he sounded like he was game so he ordered them and he was pleasently surprised at how good they were. The waiter came back and we ordered another drink each.

Mimi B.,"Valencia, CA",0,3,1,1.0,4/1/2016,"Went here on Wedsday for dinner because were staying at the Hotel across the street.  Hostess said 15 min, we were seated in 5. Hence, the 1 star.  Server came up to take a drink order. 2 sodas and a kids milk.  He disappeared for a long time and finally came back to take our order.  He brought the sodas and a GIANT cup instead of a kids cup, which is a bummer since my kiddo couldn't even hold the cup by herself.  We ordered the santa fe roll appetizer, shrimp & asparagus pasta, and the triple decker sandwich.  Plus, a kids mac & cheese & potato wedges.  He didn't come back to refill sodas at all.  NO appetizer came out, but the food did.  So we mention to him we're missing an appetizer.  He didn't seem to concerned, and said he'd go check on it. A few minutes later ANOTHER server ended up bring it out after we started eating our entrees, with no apology or anything. Our server never apologized for the mess up either.  As far as the food, the Eggrolls were bland and tiny, the pasta sauce tasted like something poured from a can, and the sandwich was very plain.  I didn't bother to taste my kids mac & cheese but I can tell you the potato wedges were also quite flavorless.  When we asked for the check he brought it, then disappeared for a long time before coming back to take payment.  We literally waited for him to bring our card back while he was at the table behind us flirting with a group of young girls for a minimum of 5 minutes.  All in all, the service was atrocious, the food sucked, and I would never come back. Dear Management: DO NOT HIRE KIDS WHO DONT CARE ABOUT YOUR PATRONS.  Had the service been better, I would have overlooked the food sucking and rated this place better.  I'll stick to the BJs by my house which actually seasons their food, and has nicer servers who are smart enough to bring a toddler a childs cup and bring out an appetizer BEFORE the entrees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello?start=460

It felt like she seated us for the convenience of the waitress, who was also waiting on the three tables directly next to us. The waitress took way too long to get us water while we needed to buy time to figure out what to eat. It felt like a 5-10 minute wait for her to come back with our drinks and take our order. She didn't even serve us our food, instead a food server came out with our dishes. The food was pretty good, though. I noticed most of the workers were busy with their own side conversations and seemed like they didn't really enjoy working there. I like going to BJ's for the great dining experience and atmosphere, especially considering the $$ price tag you pay for most of the food. Maybe I was spoiled by other BJ's with their great customer service (Chino Hills and Irvine), but this BJ's is definitely the runt of the litter.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello?start=460

I liked the sliders, minestrone soup (although a bit salty when I had it the second time around), asian chicken salad, and the pizookie!  You have to order the pizookie if you come! It's simple, choose your cookie dough and top with ice cream. When I used to eat chocolate, I luved the warm white chunk mac nut with vanilla ice cream. It was sooo delicious!  This particular location is quite busy at night, but it's within a mall, so there's plenty of parking.

Specials: $1 off beer; $2 off appetizers (excluding small bites & snacks? or something); Half off mini pizzas (comes out to about $5-6 during HH).  We tried their buffalo chicken mini pizza (4 slices) & it was really delicious! Full of flavor and not skimpy on chicken. Crust was a little soggy though. Also got their chilli cheese nachos (called something else on their menu) & it was MASSIVE. I think we barely made a dent in it. The weird thing is that the chilli is in the bottom of the dish, so it was challenging at the beginning to get some chips & chilli together.  Taste wise, even though fresh, it could've used chicken (add'l charge) & some guacamole. Yard House Chicken nachos are waaaaaay better & cheaper during their HH.  The time frame & the variety of offerings is good enough for me to want to come back & try out more things. Service is definitely lacking/slow but understandable because they are usually SWAMPED with customers. So patience comes in handy.

Robert A.,"Whittier, CA",50,145,40,4.0,3/4/2014,"Been coming to this location for quite some time now and figure it's time to apply some stars to BJ's profile. Food is actually really good, as long as you stick to what they do well. In this case the shining stars of the menu are the pizza (both deep dish and hand tossed), the chicken wings, and their burgers. Unlike a traditional Chicago deep dish, the BJ's deep dish takes a more California take on the recipe, meaning it's more doughy, yet still crispy on the outside. The burgers here are also surprisingly good, especially the newer ""Brewhouse"" varieties. Everything else here is about average, except the pastas. For some reason, I've rarely heard good things about their different pastas. So it's best to steer clear. Service is always good, but can feel a little stressed during busy periods. This location gets VERY busy during weekday lunch, so either arrive early or be ready for a short wait if you come for a weekday lunch. Otherwise, shoot for a late lunch/early dinner if you are looking for more personal service and a less packed dining room. Speaking of lunch, they do have some very good lunch specials that are plentiful and won't put a huge dent in your wallet.

I order the crispy jalapeño burger with wedge fries, first I took a bite it was good it need more flavor but over all I enjoy it.  My wife order the chicken pasta she enjoy it..oh yes I try their pumpkin ale very good with the taste of pumpkin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello?start=300

During this time we made eye contact with many of the employees, all of which did not come to the table. We didnt even get a ""we will be right with you.""  This has been by far the worst experience ive had. I dont see any reason to come back to this location. Ever. Im sure that maybe it is just one of those off nights but again, I see no reason for coming back which is a shame because I was invited to BJs by 3 employees who came to eat where I served and they were genuinely lovely people.

The pizza was cold by the time it got to our table oh yeah. I ask the server for plates to eat she just brought one plate.

I used the bjs app to reserve a seat    Email confirmation was sent back to me for ten minutes.  Keep in mind I was in the mall.  I also went ahead and used the app to order ahead. When I arrived to the hostess station I was told I would have to wait another 15 minutes. The food was ordered and confirmed by the hostess so ok what choice do I have.  We finally sat down and the hostess comes up to us to take our order.  I informed her that we already ordered through the app. 10 minutes later she comes back and says our order was never processed. That's when I should have left. But we went ahead and placed out order again.  Well my drink came out 5 minutes later and hers came out in ten.  Our meals close in total 30 to 40 minutes later.   When asked what was going on.

We had a great experience. We went again this year, per her request. The hostesses were great. After that it was the worst service I've ever received anywhere. It took 40 minutes for us to be able to order. Then once the order was about to be put in, one of my guest suggested we should change the crust of a pizza. The server, Raquel, rudely interrupted our conversation, demanding we tell her right then and there what we wanted. I told her I would let her know when we were done discussing the issue and I would let her manager know myself. Her tone changed immediately. At this point I thought she was already overly rude and asked her to leave the table. As She walked away she said ""I knew this would happen"" loud and clear for my 15 person table full of family to hear. This was so embarrassing to be disrespected in front of my whole family. Then I went to speak with the manager to let her know I wanted another server. I walked into the server bad mouthing me. Then the manager slightly acknowledged me. I went back to our table the manager came and explained she was the GM. put a New server on our table, who we rarely saw. She gave us 3 pizookies and 10 dollars off a 300+ bill. Thanks! Oh yea and they kept some kids vouchers we didn't use after all. The only reason for a star at all, are the hostesses and the random server who showed up and gave us boxes and all kinds of waters to go... I hope the tip went to him and him only.

We sat down but didn't get any attention from a waiter or busboy for several minutes. It wasn't until we asked for someone to clear and clean the table that they did anything. Aside from the rocky start, once the waitress came by, we were served promptly. The prices are very reasonable for happy hour. My friend and I shared a mini pizza, each got side salads, and shared a mini pazookie (sp?) and I got a sangria and it was all under $22. Not bad!

I have been in this industry for 20 years and for her to tell us that we were wrong and continued to say it over and over was......  Well we stood up, turned around and slowly walked to the front door. I know she saw us leaving and did nothing to stop us, or try to fix the problem. In stead she cleaned off the table and waited for the next guest to insult.  I understand that it is busy and that you maybe a bit stressed, but as someone in the   Service industry you should always handle yourself in a professional manner. One should never make the guest feel bad or sorry that they walked in the door. Bottom line is we are there to spend money and a good time if BJs can't deliver we will go somewhere else. We went across the street to Applebee's. It is really sad when my community and local restaurant gets such a bad review.

Well FUCK YOU BJs for your CORPORATE TRIFLING WAYS. They made everyone pay for their food and take it to go. We went to ORDONEZ, which is, despite considered by some to be worse than BJ, turned out to be a place where they could respect a man and his friends in festivities.

You could taste the frozen storage inside the hot yum-looking fries-- Not fresh, not cool! The cookie was good but what hot cookie doesn't taste good? The ice-cream was forgettable. My friend got ugly oranges on his Blue Moon and when he ordered a second one, I'm sure our server forgot after 20min. about it and the bartender brought it over.  Don't plan on coming  back...

Then here comes our entrées. I asked the waiter about the artichoke dip and he stated it was still being delayed  because it was made fresh.

You also get some garlic bread too.  Another thing that's tasty is their Fresh Basil and Sausage pizza. It's a flatbread pizza with mozzarella, Fontina and Parmesan cheeses. They add fresh basil, Roma tomatoes and Italian sausage.  I went with friends recently and someone ordered the Potato Chip appetizer.   They were awesome! And that means a lot because I don't even like potato chips. For dessert, you can never go wrong with a pizookie. I hear they have individual ones now. My fave is the white chocolate macademia nut. While I like this BJ's, I also plan accordingly. If I need to be somewhere in an hour or hour and a half, I'm probably not going to put this on my list because of their incosistent service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello?start=400

After finishing the first round, nobody came by to check on us.  Service is Terrible-Terrible-Terrible, our order was incorrect and the server was a girl-with low communication skills as she could not explain anything.

The waitress barely came by to check up on our table throughout the meal, and we didn't get a single refill on water until we asked a different waiter for it. Then she forgot to give my friend the birthday dessert thing people get here. When we got the take-out order at the end, she gave it to my friend without a bag. REALLY? I hope this silly bitch enjoyed her tip. Can't believe I actually had my birthday here a few years ago. Would not have wanted her to serve 20 people, since she's barely able to handle 3.

Balsamic vinaigrette, marinated oven roasted mushrooms, caramelized onions, fresh thyme, parsley, Fontina cheese and balsamic glaze. Amazing! I always request to add some jalapenos on it, to give it a little kick. The pastas and burgers are never a let down either.  Pretty good beer selection. Options from German Kolsch, to Russian stout. But I always stick to my Stella. Big screen TV's at every angle so you never miss a milisecond of any game. If you are impatient, then you might want to go to different location.

I was here for a party and the catering was great with spaghetti and pizza. Came on my own, and still felt the pizza was good, but their salads are amazing!  The cobb (minus bacon) is soooo good. I love that they dice the salad so small that you don't have to take your knife to it just so you can fit it in your mouth. Its chilled perfectly that it just makes you want more. The same goes for their BBQ chicken and caesar.  Their appetizers are pretty good, mostly i enjoy the artichoke / spinach dip and Santa Fe spring rolls.

The servers are very friendly and informative but they just don't seem to have the rhythm down. They lack the skills.  You'll soon go parched and pass out of thirst before you see a server within range to be flagged down. And the time that goes by from being seated to having someone come and ask to take your order is sometimes ridiculous.  The food has always come quickly when I've visited though.  I was there for the Laker game last night, GO LAKERS, and we ordered burgers, appetizers, and a sandwich and had it all at the table in just under 10 minutes which was a huge surprise given how busy it was.  This location is not the cleanest either. I usually find myself asaking to have the table wiped down again when I'm seated. Sorry, but I don't like a greasy table to eat at. Gross.  This place is, in my opinion, average. Nothing special.  Decent prices some good food.  Definitely not a place to go for dates, to take your parents to, or even co workers. LOL.

I went there again today during lunch b/c I had a free coupon for a pizookie.  Luckily we got there before the lunchtime rush (11:40am) b/c by 12:30 it was utter madness!  The party of 10 right next to our table got their orders messed up like 5x.  One waitress was acting all rude like it was the customers fault.  Luckily, my friend and I didn't encounter such problems, but the hectic craziness all around me was kinda stressing me out.    K, now on to the food:  Their pizzas are decent, definately not the best.  Stay away from the thin crust appetizer pizzas!! The crusts were soooo thin it felt like i was eating baked crackers with pesto dip.  The pastas are mehhhh.. nothing to write home about.  I'd stick with the specialty pizzas and the appetizers.  Also, they have special deals during lunch and happy hour if u wana save a buck or 2.     The highlight of the meal was definately the pizookie!! For those pizookie virgins out there.. its basically a ginormous cookie in a mini pizza pan with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream on top.  Get the ""black and white"" which is 1/2 chocolate chunk 1/2 white chocolate macadamia nut cookie.. yummmm :]",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello?start=580

So she comes back with just a receipt for the ATM card and just hoped we forgot about the extra money on the gift card, until i mentioned it to her. So she came back with my card that still had money in it and she totally gave me an attitude and literally threw my confirmation receipt to me.

G D.,"Beverly Hills, CA",2,15,,4.0,2/17/2015,"While this isn't the first time I've been to this location, I wanted to give my compliments to the manager. To set the scene, I went with my girlfriend's family to eat and we were a big party. It was about 6 pm and the place was pretty busy. Waitress came and took our order. Wait time for food was longer than normal, but acceptable. I ordered a buffalo burger off of the ""healthy"" menu choices, medium rare. I was aiming to not totally pig out tonight. Anyway, the food came out, I cut my burger in half, and took a couple of bites.  It was rare at best, but I think it was slightly raw. I flag the waitress down and tell her about it. She says I can have it cooked more or have it remade.  She also suggested upping the temperature to medium. I thought remaking as medium was fine and she takes my food back. While waiting manager (I think his name is Chris, but not 100% since it was pretty loud) comes by, apologizes for under cooked burger, and offers a soup or salad to tide me over. I decline because I didn't want to over eat. Second burger comes out and I cut it down the middle.  It's even MORE under cooked and looks raw in the middle.  My girlfriend brought a waiter (not the one serving our table) and sends the burger back.  Manager comes back and apologizes again. I ask him for a menu so I can order something else (grilled turkey and ham sandwich). He brings my food out and apologizes again. About half way through me eating, manager comes back to check up on me. He offers dessert to the table. I tell him others have already ordered a pizookie and he says he'll make it so we can all share it. I believe it was also comped. The pizookie was upgraded to the large size and it was half white chocolate and half regular chocolate. Don't know if anyone from BJ's will read this but I wanted to give credit to the manager for handling the situation professionally and quickly. I can't thank the manager enough as not all mangers were as nice as him. I also hope he was able to actually see the second under cooked burger I got.

Then ordered a porter (beer) and it just does not taste as good as it use to. I remember really enjoying the porter here. Is quality control going down hill or are they using cheaper ingredients.... or better yet is there a new brewer who isn't doing a good job? Probably a combo of both. The pizza was ""meh"" I remember really enjoying it but now its just forgettable and I'll probably look elsewhere for a decent deep dish pizza.

Carina K.,"Arcadia, CA",0,1,,2.0,2/28/2012,"This Bj's is definitely one of the worst I've ever been to. First off the service is hit or miss. I've had terrible service as in the waiter drops off the food and never checks back to refills our drinks, to very attentive friendly waiters. But the biggest issue for me is the quality of food.  First off it seems that every time I go there's always something that goes wrong with my order. Every time I go I expect for my order to be screwed up. It falls in between asking for a side of Ranch Dressing multiple times, which isn't really a big deal, to them not topping an order of nachos with chili, the bottom of the plate was covered with it. When I flagged down a waiter and asked if that there was supposed to be more chilli the waiter with a straight faced confirmed that yes, that is how the dish is served and walked away without offering anymore assistance. Obviously, chili goes on top of the nachos, a fact they overlooked somehow. For a restaurant known for its pizza they served a Great White with marinara sauce and not white sauce. It wasn't until later that I realized what was wrong with that pizza.  For some reason the food seems off. I don't know if its the inexperience kitchen staff or what but the taste of the food is different then from others I've been too.  Due to these reasons and examples I have since refused to go to that Bj's. It has been a constant stream of mistakes that they don't catch or refuse to correct. It had gotten to the point where when I went I expected something to go wrong. Don't mistaken me, I have gone to other Bj's and have had the complete opposite experience. Maybe with time, and better management, this place will get better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello?start=620

I came on monday 7/11/11 and was turned away my i assume the manager because he was in a dress shirt telling me they had to  close early because of an emergency, i look inside, PEOPLE WERE IN THERE EATING! if it was an emergency, wouldn't they have gotten people out? or at least offer me something like even a 1% off my next bill for my waste of time driving there? he didn't even say it all that nice either 2. so i decided to come back here yesterday night on wednesday 7/13/11 because i was still craving for the food and i had a card that gives me a free pazooki with a purchase of an entree. so i gave it to our server and she was okay with it. then comes back THE SAME MANAGER that turned us away on monday, came to our table and stated in a rude manner ""we cannot give you the pazooki, the card expired already"" and while he was saying that, he was already turning his back on us and walked off. did not even ask us if we still want to order it or anything else for desert.

We went for late lunch (2 pm) on a Wednesday.  Sure, we didn't have to wait for a table since the place was nearly empty.  But the service was horrendous!  Our server announced from the beginning that he was new and his trainer would be watching to make sure he didn't mess up.  I want to know what in the world was wrong with his trainer then because they were BOTH AWFUL! Offenses committed by new guy and his trainer: 1. Assuring us the appetizer would be ""right out"" and then us waiting 15 minutes.  2. Not bringing plates or napkins for the appetizer.   3. Not bringing utensils for the salads. 4. Handing us our utensils FROM BEHIND US OVER A COUNTER BECAUSE HE WAS TOO LAZY TO WALK AROUND! 5. Forcing us to demand refills instead of noticing our loud straw slurpy noises when we were done 6. Leaving empty cups and plates on the table when bringing refills 7. Forcing us to tell him we were out of room and that he needed to take the empty stuff away. 8. Taking frickin' forever to bring things we asked for; it was later determined that his slowness was because he refused to take a trip out of the kitchen until he had supplied the requests of all three tables he was waiting.  So if you were the first person to ask, you had to wait until the other two tables wanted something for him to go get it. 9. Placing our drinks at the far end of the table, forcing us to pass them to the appropriate people (this was the trainer and this was done with cold calculation as she did not even lift her eyes). 10. Not remembering that my friend didn't want croutons. 11.  Rounding the credit card split charges to the nearest dollar, resulting in one person from our party paying less than the other two. WHAT THE HELL?  I have been to other BJ's locations during the evening rush and had really good service.  This place is just awful.  And since this guy was terrible under the direction of a so-called trainer, you can rest assured that future generations of servers at this location will be learning the wrong way to do their jobs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello?start=620

We had a departmental lunch party of 12 a while back, and needless to say from the other posting, the service is horrendous. We had to wait about 45 minutes before we were seated. The team was pretty much standing around the whole time as there were not enough seats for them. The only form of entertainment we had during that time were our conversations, the menu, and one of the BJ's employee who was pushing water out of the center of the waiting area with a big squeegee as it was raining pretty hard that day. We were planning on having a team luncheon that would last for about an hour or an hour and a half as some of us had meetings to attend to. So after we get our food, I pretty much had to wolf down my lunch so I could make my scheduled meeting which I had to reschedule by 30 minutes. Luckily, no one was upset.

I always try my best to be nice and polite to my food handlers for fear of retaliation. Just saying. So the food was good, and my dessert was even better.  A baked beignet with a scope of vanilla ice cream with strawberries and whipped cream...interesting take on the strawberry shortcake.

The pasta was a bit stiff, though. But nothing a hungry asian can't handle.  The BBQ CHICKEN CHOPPED SALAD was pretty good, though. I especially liked the black beans that they put in there.  I must say, though, for a big group of 40+, we sure had good service.

I've only ever had deep dish in Chicago but there's looks pretty good too. But then I always get their lunch specials. This time I had the half sandwich and soup entree. I got the chicken club and the clam chowder. It was really good. Chowder was a bit salty so I could only have half of it before giving up. And the chicken was cooked well - not dry and it went well with the other ingredients in the sandwich. It also came with the option of steak fries - I love steak fries and these were seasoned really well. My friend got the grilled cheese and tomato bisque. Kinda a small potion but it was only like $6 so it was expected. They offer half a sandwich for a dollar less which would be good for a kid but you'll barely be full just on the whole sandwich. Then cause it was my birthday, I also got a mini pizookie for free. I'd never seen their mini size before. It's perfect for one but of course, I shared with my friend. For birthdays, they used to offer the regular size pizookie of any flavor but now they're skimping and only had the mini one of chocolate chip flavor. Oh well - still delicious. It wasn't too busy during a weekday lunch but our waiter seemed very scarce. Could do better in that department. Otherwise, this is def one of my fav chain places due mostly to their pizookie.

Dodgers were playing, restaurant had enough tables for walk in customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello?start=560
Chance B.,"Anaheim, CA",229,23,,5.0,12/5/2011,I love this place... My better half and I order pizza to go and they got the order wrong so I had to high tale it back because white bread is not an option...once I told them they gave back the same pizza and said have it we will make a new!!! Service food and beers are always the best here!!!! Forever a loyal patron and guest!!!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello?start=560
Art N.,"San Francisco, CA",81,26,,2.0,6/24/2011,"Consistently bad service. well at least they are consistent right? Everyone in the area knows how terrible the service can be at this location. Recently I had to ask for straws and silverware. Beverage refills and condiments we ordered for our food 3 times (yes, told the server 3 times to get us a sauce) food gets to the table at completely different times from the rest of the people you are dining with. I've gotten my salad after my entree and the food has been cold. The only thing i recommend is to have an appetizer. Its straight forward and hard to mess up. I have faith in this restaurant, more so due to its geographical location convenience but service really has made me go elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello?start=560
Javier J.,"Los Angeles, CA",1656,1996,248,3.0,5/28/2008,"The Montebello Mall. You really can't get more Ghetto than this. The only problem is that it doesn't want to admit how ghetto it actually is. It hides behind some higher end shops that the are way out of the league of the average Montebello shoppers range. You have a Coach store. I'm surprised most didn't realize it was actually spelled Coach and not Couch, as their flea market knock off's would have been labelled as.  Back to BJ's. It looks nice, then again, it may as well not even be in the mall as the only entrance is located outside of the mall. A detail that allows them to serve alcohol and stay open past the hours of the mall, I bet.  The place is small for a BJ's. But what it lacks in size it makes up with numbers of TV's they have. If you're ever in the mood to watch a Lakers, Raiders or Dodgers game, you're more than welcome here. Unless you're routing for the other time. In which case don't wear your colors, you'll get shanked.  The bar area is huge. there's a large wall of liquor that just makes you want to hold your liver and be thankful it still works. Which can lead to a nicely brewed beer. They have many seasonal beers that will peak your interest and the sampler will have you on the floor.  With all this talk about beer you'll need to fill that stomach with some food. BJ's, as a chain, is pretty good. Over all the pizza quality and sandwiches are ones that I can't get enough of. Just don't walk into the mall. I guess it's a saving grace that they aren't any possible chances of stepping into the mall when you walk in here. Separated by glass, you can look at all those folks in the crappy mall shop away as you drink some good beer and drown your sorrows of being near the Montebello Mall with a piezookie.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello?start=560
nar b.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,31,4,1.0,8/25/2011,"Everyyyy time I go to a BJ's, they always mess up!  The most recent time I went, however, sucked! Don't get me wrong, the food IS good but they always screw everything up. For example: I had ordered a certain type of pizza, they brought me the totally wrong thing! When I nicely asked about it, the server replied, ""Oh no, that's it."" Um, nooo! I know what I ordered! The ingredients in the description didn't even match what I got! He kept saying, ""No, this is right!"" Whateverrrr. Also, my friend got a sandwich and they brought out the fries in the end. Wth?? They also took foreverrrrrr in bringing us food! Even our water! Really, it takes 25 minutes to bring water?!?! and eggrolls?! and then missing french fries and getting my pizza wrong? Ugh. He did give us free dessert for ""waiting for the food"" but still! Hmph.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello?start=560
Fernando Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",86,52,76,1.0,4/8/2009,This BJ's is just a regular restaurant. Nothing screams out above average. The service is poor since our waiter got one of the food orders in my group wrong and also spilled beer on my friend when he brought our drinks to the table. The waiters have a tendency of dropping and spilling things since I saw them drop plates and a pitcher of water on a table with customers sitting there. The food here is just ok. I had a Cobb salad but it just lacked flavor. It just needed more bleu cheese dressing. My friend had the pizza and looked very good but I rather go somewhere else for pizza than coming here for it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello?start=560
Tatiana D.,"Pico Rivera, CA",54,48,,4.0,3/26/2008,"Nice addition to the Monteghetto mall! I LOVE pizookie!! The service here is okay. Seems like everyones new and doesn't really know what they're doing. I expected more from a ""high volume"" restaurant. When you get there when they're about to close, they tend not to care about you too much. I'm sure they just want you out but I'd probably do the same if I worked a closing shift.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello?start=560
Mick G.,"San Diego, CA",500,506,54,2.0,5/3/2008,"I am not a huge chain food fan, but BJ's has always managed to sorta stay on top of the fray a bit to me ...
